I have read all of Heyer's  books and am avid collecter of them but this particular one will not be  joining my bookshelf.
B00004THAY|5.0|This stuff is absolutely killer! Best I've heard in several months (and I've heard alot!)These two masters play off each other so fluidly and, well, perfectly. From Hiatt's title track thru several BB tunes, a cover of  Big Bill Broonzy's &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; all the way to a version  of &quot;Hold on,I'm Coming&quot; which destroys the original and takes it  to completely new heights! This album is sure to sweep the Grammy's, mark  my words!
B000021XS0|5.0|I don't understand people that rate this album with 1 star. Where is your sense of hearing men?<br />This is the most amazing album by DT. The way this guys play their instruments in simply out of this planet. Try to find song  structures like these in a Kid Rock album...<br />The story takes you, from  regression, the beautiful The Spirit Carries On, to the amazing end in  Finally Free. And it does that with some amazing melodies and wordeful  lyrics.<br />If you like this, don't miss Liquid Tension Experiment, a side  project from 3 of the members of this band, plus Tony Levin, one of the  better (if not the best) bass players out there.

0380730367|5.0|I read one or two books a week.  This is the first book by Dennis Lehane that I've read.  I loved the characters especially Bubba.  I couldn't put this book down, had to find out what happens next.  Just ordered Gone,  Baby, Gone and A Drink Before The War after reading the reviews.
B00004TJLD|5.0|As I'm sure you already know, I Robot has been a staple in the playlists of stereo shops around the globe since its release in 1977. You could always count on an Alan Parsons album when you wanted to test a stereo  system. Parsons is a true master of the studio, and to many, this album was  (and still is) his finest hour. Well, now it's even better. Classic Records  just released I Robot in D.A.D. format and the sound is even more  spectacular than before. The CD version pales in comparison.<br />The album  only produced one hit single, \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You,\\" a major  success during the disco craze of the late 70's. Fortunately, the song gave  the album the sales boost it needed, exposing Parsons and the rest of the  Project to the masses. Naturally, the rest of the album is nothing like the  single, ranging from the pulsing instrumental electronics of the title  track, to songs that should've been hits but weren't (\\"Breakdown,\\" which  featured Hollies vocalist Allan Clarke on lead vocals), to the quieter  songs like \\"Some Other Time\\" and \\"Don't Let it Show.\\"<br />Where the D.A.D.  really shines is on \\"The Voice.\\" There are an unbelievable number of subtle  nuances going on in this song, and you can hear each of them (plus several  things that you couldn't hear before) with breathtaking clarity. The low  end on this track in particular will literally shake the room. As the song  segued into \\"Nucleus\\" and then \\"Day After Day,\\" I was taken back to the  days of Laserium; only I don't ever remember it sounding this good inside  the planetarium. Maybe it was just the 70's...<br />Classic has done a  consistently excellent job with their D.A.D. line, and I Robot surpasses  all expectations. Turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and get ready  to be blown away. <br />(note: You must have a DVD player to listen to this  disc. It will not play in CD players.)
6302787297|4.0|As to having a French actor playing an Italian sailing for the Spanish in an English language movie,all I can say is that this is an on-going Hollywood tradition. There isn't a single Spanish or Latin actor in any  leading role! Depardieu does a great job portraying Columbus. He shows  vision, ambition, zealousness, compassion and shortsightedness to a  convincing degree. I must admit that the most appealing aspect of Scott's  film has to be the great cinematography. The scene as Columbus first walks  upon the beachhead raises thoughts of the dire consequences for the  indigenous inhabitants of the continent in the following years. I give this  film thumbs up.
B000002VC3|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums, and in my opinion the best APP album followed by Turn of a Friendly Card. Turn your system up,lay back, close your eyes and listen to Silence and I. If you are like me you are  transformed to imagry of riding a great stede through a forest to the  rescue of of just about everyone. If you want to feel good about yourself,  you gotta get this album. Phsycobabble is outstanding!

0767903854|4.0|After the nadir of &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; this book continues Bill Bryson's recovery that started with &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot;. While not matching &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; or  &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot; on occasions it comes close.<br />Bryson  retains his obvious affection for the people and places he writes about,  and there are a few of the laugh out loud moments that made &quot;Notes  From a Small Island&quot; such a hazardous read in public places. Otherwise  it's fairly droll, and as so often with such books, tells us as much about  the author as the ostensible subject of his books. Trouble is, by now  regulars know the author pretty well and that particular subject is  beginning to pall.<br />Such quibbles aside, this book is still better than  the vast majority of similar writings, and can be recommended.<br />Just one  question though. Why didn't he title it by the accurate quote which he  himself notes should be &quot;In a Sunburnt Country&quot;? Too archaic for  our American cousins?
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie is terrible. Unless you want to sit through two and a half hours of junk to get to the thirty minutes that are actually worth something, do not buy this.

B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney Spears is a PRODUCT, a brand name, an icon for a marketing campaign that projects an image of slightly risque nubile sexuality. Her albums are merely the centerpiece of this money-making strategy. People can  denounce this music all they want as poorly written and produced, but it  doesn't matter, because millions of people will still line up like drones  and buy it, just like those &quot;wazzup?&quot; commercials might entice  men to buy a certain brand of beer. The point is that &quot;Oops...I Did it  Again!&quot;'s validation is not artistic, but purely commercial. This  record succeeds brilliantly in its sole objective: to move a ton of units.  The film critic Roger Ebert once wrote of the film &quot;Pink  Flamingos&quot; that he was giving it no stars because the film wasn't even  really a film, it was simply an object to be gawked at. Since Amazon  doesn't present an option for no stars, I'll give it 2, a mixture of my  assessments of its aesthetic quality (almost nonexistant) and its  product-moving capabilities (brilliant). In the end, Britney Spears and  Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync are all simply objects, puppets (that &quot;No  Strings Attached&quot; title is a funny misnomer). But pop music has always  been that way.

B00003W8NM|4.0|this movie is great! for once we see a great movie that summarizes heindigger's philosophy concerning technology. confused? in any case this is a great movie that is both funny and enlightening. if u enjoy watching a  good &quot;down to earth&quot; movie then this is the movie for you. i  think norton did a great job, as well a pitt. the movie is a bit graphic  but its necessary to show the true impact of what is being told. and with 2  dvd's and at this price this is definetly a win win situation fun and  packed with extra bonus material.
6302787564|3.0|Michael Douglas Gives Another standout performance in this dark thriller about a former defense worker pushed to the limit with the stress of urban life and goes on a walking rampage throuhout the mean streets of Los Angeles. As he travels his way to see his estranged wife he encounters a  whole assorment of shady people who make his journey a difficult one. He  encounters viscoius Latino gang members, a rasict army surplus owner, a  korean store owner who refuses to give him change in probabbly the most  memorable scene of the entire film when Douglas destroys his store with the  owner's baseball bat. A very good idea about a man who's worked all his  life then all of a sudden he's no longer in demand in the workforce and to  himself he feels useless. ...  Duvall plays this role certain effciency as a man who too feels the same  stress as Douglas but has maintained his sanity and never going over the  edge. Great Performaces all the around, it certainty is a film worth  talking about.
0380730367|4.0|I read a lot of detective fiction and for my money this series by Lehane is the best currently out there. Great characters and very involving plots are the strengths here. I'm giving Prayers for Rain four stars instead of  five only because I didn't find it quite as good as his previous book Gone,  Baby, Gone which is the best novel in this genre I've read in years. One  more thing, if your new to this series, read the books in order. Lehane  seems to get a perverse pleasure in revealing the outcomes of his preceding  novels in subsequent ones.
B0000041Z6|5.0|Dentro de la grabaciones de las integrales de las Sinfon&iacute;as de Gustav Mahler, se destacan los Sets de Sir Georg Solti/ CHSO, Leonard Bernstein en DGG con varias orquestas, Bernstein en SONY, Kubelik con la Orquesta de la  Radio difusi&oacute;n B&aacute;vara. Cualquiera de los albums anteriormente mencionados  son de CINCO ESTRELLAS y la verdad que basta uno de ellos para que uno se  sienta satisfecho. Entonces la pregunta es &iquest;Cu&aacute;l comprar? Esto depender&aacute; en  gran medida a los gustos personales de cada cual.<br />La integral de Solti  se caracteriza por el sonido s&oacute;lido, voluminoso, preciso que son  caracter&iacute;sticas del &quot;Solti Sound&quot;. La combinaci&oacute;n Solti/Mahler, a  mi gusto es SENSACIONAL (LETAL), cuando escuche el primer movimiento de la  sexta va entender a que me estoy refiriendo. La octava es la interpretaci&oacute;n  favorita de la mayor&iacute;a de los cr&iacute;ticos. Las ocho trompas que dan la  apertura de la tercera, nos recuerdan por que se dec&iacute;a que la CHSO, tenia  los mejores bronces del mundo! En la primera a mi criterio el tempo de  Solti es un poco lento. El manejo de solistas y coros en las Sinfon&iacute;as, que  as&iacute; lo requieren son impecables. El sonido de DECCA es FABULOSO, como  grabado ayer.<br />En resumen una integral de primer nivel, FUERTEMENTE  RECOMENDADO.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oh my god this is the coolest album ever made in the history of music!  Britney belongs in the music hall of fame!  I love her so much! For all of you that are putting her down,,you're just jealous that she sells more  albums than the artists you like. BRITNEY FOREVER!
B000002C1V|5.0|I am mostly a classical-music fan, but there are a few examples of rock music that, I believe, poke through into the realm of high art -- one other example is Jefferson Airplane's early work.  I have yet to hear any rock  album other than &quot;The Final Cut&quot; that combines intelligent,  meaningful lyrics with such a truly creative score.  It was surprise for me  recently to hear someone refer to this album as the WORST rock album he had  ever heard.  I started talking about it to others, and found that people  more inclined towards classical music and jazz rate this album very highly,  while true rock fans generally give it very low marks.  This in itself  makes the album unique.<br />This album shows what rock music CAN do when it  works well -- lasting commentary on political figures, war, technology,  family, and genocide are all contained in this fine work.
B00004U3UG|4.0|Army of Darkness is the third and final chapter in the classic trilogy  that begun in 1982 with the memorable shocker The Evil Dead. Sam  Raimi(director) and Bruce Campbell(lead actor) went forward to create a  hoorror-comedy sequel a few years later, after the original's commercial  success despite its extremely low budget. The trilogy ended(?) with AOD  which turned out to be a straight action movie that retained the humor but  was almost clean of the horror and gore elements of the previous two. While  the latter has been a let down for the series' many followers, the fact is  that it's a very entertaining film, mostly due to Campbell's cracking  performance and Raimi's superb direction. The story begins where the  previous one ended, with Ash (Campbell) being trapped in the middle Ages  and having to find the Book of the Dead in order to return to the present.  In the meantime, he accidentally unleashes the army of the dead which he  has to fight with the odds against him. Featuring some quite distinctive  action pieces, unforgettable one-liners and the exhilarating Ram-o-cam  shots, Army of darkness is a really cool film that you won't regret  watching.  This DVD version is the director's cut which adds 15 min. to the  theatrical cut. Also don't forget to check out the commentary track with  Raimi and Campbell and an interesting look behind the scenes.
B00000J2SP|4.0|Joe Lynn Turner is a great lead singer, unfortunately too much attracted to pop music. This is clear in this album, &quot;I SURRENDER&quot; and &quot;MAGIC&quot;, two weak songs (the first being a cover). THe best song,  far and away, is the instrumental track using Beethoven pieces. The rest is  average, but in no way bad.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Supernatural is one of the best selling albums of 1999. It is a great album. But escaped from my annual top 10.<br />This album is marked by good mix of Spanish and English songs. That itself is cool, because even Julio  Iglesias tried to sing most of the tracks in English when he tried to bust  out multimillion selling albums. English tracks are not bad and Smooth and  Put Your Lights On surely rocks. Other English language tracks are either  Ok to so-so.  But Spanish language tracks are really excellent particularly  Africa Bamba and Migra which will sure to become great source for learning  Spanish. Overall three and a half for English tracks and five stars for  Spanish tracks. Calling may be great for live but a bit too long for  ordinary music fans like me particularly when listening in CD.
0152465030|5.0|The Little Prince is a book that will change your life. It is philisophical, but not presumptuous; it is thoughtful, but not exhaustingly so. St-Ex (as we called him in my French class in Israel, where I first read the book) has established a beautiful balance. In the shapes of a  small boy and a grown man who refuses to be a &quot;grande personne,&quot;  he puts forth some of the most lucid philisophical insights I have ever  encountered.  You must read this book, for life and for love.
B00000JGEF|5.0|Predator, this has to be the most compelling science fiction movie I'v ever seen with the exeption of Aliens. The look of the creature it self is completly original. I wouldn't mind having an outfit like that. The movie  makis you want to go camping. The sound Track is the best I've ever heard.  Better than star wars. It even makes you feel like you are being hunted.  Every thing is perfect with this movie.
0060234814|5.0|The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe has earned a spot on my top ten list of my all time favorite books. This is without a doubt one of the greatest books ever written. <br />In this book we are introduced to Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They find a magic wardrobe that takes them to the land of  Narnia where wonderful adventures await them. <br />Memorable characters  abound in this book: Aslan-the great lion, Jadis-the white witch,  Tumnus-the faun, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver ... just to name a few. <br />This is fun  reading. Buy this book.
B00001U0DP|5.0|The Holocaust has been a point of interest for me since my brief residency in Germany as a child in the late 50's, and I've read many books on the topic, basically trying to understand the meaning of life, and deal with  the knowledge that people can be so cruel to each other.  <br />Still, for  months, I'd avoided watching this movie. No doubt that reveals a bit too  much about me - I've always  been one to cover my eyes at scary scenes in  movies (there's a scene in Dancing with Wolves that I never have seen and  don't intend to).  I've never made it through the movie version of  Shindler's List, though I'd read the book - perhaps I don't need to watch  that one. This movie is quite different than Shindler's List, although it  teaches the same history.<br />Watching the trailers for this movie made me  think it could not  possibly be for me.  The idea of a child in a  concentration camp seemed the ultimate horror. How could such a movie be as  wonderful as reviewers were saying?   Eventually, through recommendations  from friends, I rented it, comforted by the knowledge that I could always  fast-forward it if it got too awful to watch.<br />I didn't fast-forward over  this movie, but fell in love with the lead character and stuck with him to  the end.  Roberto Benigni makes you love Guido, and that love for him (and  his own love for his young son) draws you into this story that is based on  so many incredible stories of that time and place.<br />On the surface, Guido  is a buffoon, a slapstick goofball, who falls in love with a beautiful  woman. His goofiness his really an expression of his love of life, his  humor, his willingness to take incredibly wild changes. These are the very  traits that win him the love of this woman, in an incredible scene as she  almost marries the wrong guy. These skills are what allows him to save his  son's life, and his son's sanity, during their stay together in a  concentration camp.<br />This is a treasure, not to be viewed just once, but  to be owned and watched again and again.  Give a gift to yourself and  friends, too.(In my opinion, it needs to be sub-titled, because the  photography and the facial expressions of Benigni should not be missed for  a second.)<br />  While writing a review of Elie Wiesel's book,  &quot;Night&quot;, I decided to cross-reference this move - evidently it is  on the reading list for some high schools in their diversity programs. Book  reviews posted on here by high school seniors made me realize that Wiesel's  book needed to be accompanied by a movie that will make the connection that  the written word can't do for those who are blissfully unaware, if only by  their fortunate lack of experience yet with life.viewed just once, but  to be owned and watched again and again.

B00000JCB2|5.0|Oh man did this album ever get old in a hurry.  I was sick of &quot;Nookie&quot; after 2 days, and heard it on the radio 6 times in the duration of those 2 days, just sickening.  That, and the idea of rap/rock  is just appalling to me, which is what a LOT of the CD is composed  of.<br />Another thing, Matt Pinfield's speech near the end is chock full of  contradictions!  But I enjoyed ONE part of the album:  Les Claypool's (from  Primus) part in saying how you just wasted 15 bucks on this horrible album.   He really speaks his mind, thus giving the segment's name &quot;the Mind  of Les.&quot;<br />NO STARS.
B00004RFCM|4.0|Okay, perhaps it isn't completely realistic for a woman to immediately break up with a great guy just because she learns he has horrendous taste in china patterns. But realism isn't the main point of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The show is meant to be chic and funny, and here it succeeds with flying colors. And though realism may not be its strong suit (do most people really go through THAT many boyfriends and girlfriends in the space of a few months?) there IS undeniable truth in many of the situations the characters find themselves in, and in the wry observations the sexes make about each other. Love the music and opening credits of the show, too-- VERY hip and trendy, which is exactly as it should be! The DVD set is a great bargain: almost six hours of entertaining programming, a few modest extras (excellent organization and presentation of all the episodes' promo spots, by the way), and a package for which some agency or person should win a design award for both its look and practicality, and all for about thirty bucks. Bring on season two! And then maybe... The Sopranos? Please?

B00002EPJH|5.0|I was so happy to hear that he had completed a new album, I knew he was strugling with an illness that had left him unable to play for a few years. Don't listen to any reviewer who gave this less than five stars. It doesn't  get any better than Kieth Jarrett. He took jazz on his own tangent in the  70's. With this album he has a more symplistic and refined style,  transposing pure emotion. It is the easiest to listen to out of all his  solo efforts. It is very beuatiful, and certainly high quality from the  best there is.
B00000JBCP|5.0|Man has been my favorite band ever since I heard &quot;Dnde Jugarn Los Nios&quot; for the first time several years ago. Unplugged is a Fantastic Album! I liked the CD so much that I bought the DVD, too, and I highly  recommend it. As far as comparisons with the &quot;Man en Vivo&quot; album  are concerned, the sound quality and precision are much better on  Unplugged. Man's acoustic version of Cuando los Angeles Lloran has some  gorgeous guitar solos by Sergio that I've listened to hundreds of times,  and I like Vivir Sin Aire better on &quot;Unplugged&quot; than on  &quot;Dnde Jugarn&quot; or &quot;Vivo&quot;.  I hope to hear additional  acoustic songs from Man in the future.
0140185232|5.0|The Razor's Edge is simply a must-read book. In it, Maugham details the life of Larry (the protagonist of the novel) as a man who is searching for the meaning of life. <br />Perhaps what makes this book unusual is the fact  that it takes the perspective of the author (yes, Maugham, is one of the  character in the novel)as he observes the protagonist's quest. Along the  way, Maugham also delves into the action and motives of other characters as  a contrast to Larry. <br />At the end of the novel, as Larry expound on the  fruits of his quest, Maugham wryly observes, he is too earthly and  pragmatic to share Larry's vision. Yet, at the same time, he cannot help  but admire Larry's quest for meaning. I found myself agreeing with  Maugham.<br />It is a novel which I would recommend for everyone to read as it  captures a phase of life which all of us would have gone through.
B000035P7X|5.0|Dylan's '65 London tour was one of the last acoustic tours before he went electric the following year at Newport.  It's also a wonderful look at how the press treated Dylan and other musicians (e.g. the Beatles) during that  time. Rolling Stone wasn't around in '65, let alone rock critics and  reporters. Hence, Dylan was upset with how magazines like Time would  present him.
630460291X|5.0|Out of every movie I have ever seen (and trust me when I say, I have spent thousands on seeing movies), this is the only one that I have seen that has actually brought me to tears because it was so well played, and so  believeable. Thanks to the help of all the actors in this film, like Kevin  Costner, Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater, and everyone else who was in it,  like the Lady Mariann, Duncan, and everyone else. This movie has the  perfect blend of romance, action, and tragedy in it, to fit anyones  craving. But it is your classic case of forbidden love, mixed with a lot of  sword fighting, death, and heroic accounts. The writers of this movie have  given the tale of Robin Hood, a twist, which makes it that much better than  any other tale you will find out there. Right from the beginning, there is  death, action, and heroic adventures. You will truly love this movie, and  it will hold a place in your heart, as it does for me.

630460291X|5.0|Yall people are flaming crackheads for ever saying that the film could have been better without Kevin Costner! He was Robin Hood! He played that role better than anyone I've ever seen! So what he didnt have an english  accent! If he would have tried to have an accent, all of you would probably  be critisizing at his attempt! I dont hear anyone complaining about Lady  marianns accent, it was almost the exact same! And this film would not have  been great without the help of every actor! They picked the cast perfectly  for this film. The scenery was perfect, and the Moor, Azim, had a great  role in the movie. He was vowed to Robin Hood because Robin saved his life.  He was perfect for the role of Robin Hood's sidekick! Maybe some of yall  need to sit back down and rewatch the movie!
B000009ED0|5.0|This CD is a true rarity.  &quot;Follow the Leader/Issues&quot; (Korn), &quot;Significant Other&quot; (Limp Bizkit), &quot;The Battle Of Los Angeles&quot; (Rage Against The Machine);  Kid Rock shames all of them with  his debut album, &quot;Devil Without A Cause.&quot;  The beauty of this  album is that it boasts a huge variety of musical scores.  For example,  look at the three smash hits  &quot;Bawitaba,&quot; &quot;Cowboy&quot; and  &quot;Only God Knows Why.&quot;  Each song covers a different genre, yet  retains Kid Rock's unique attitude.  Even after purchasing new CDs, I still  find myself placing this one in my audio player--the mark of a truly great  album.
B000001EC1|5.0|Bon Jovi's collection of 14 classic grooves is pretty much what it says it is. Its a greatest hits album that has most of the good stuff.      The album starts with the classic &quot;Livin' On a Prayer&quot;.  If this song  doesn't make you want to sing there is something wrong with you.  The album  also includes &quot;Runaway&quot; &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; and  &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, three more songs that are definatly  sing-along favorites.     There are two songs on the album that are not  very good: &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; and &quot;In and Out of  Love&quot;.  They should not be included, but what can you do?  Other songs  on the album wich are above standard are &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;(From  the Young Guns II album) and &quot;I'll Be There For You&quot;.      Crossroads also includes three tracks that are on no other Bon Jovi albums.  &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot;, and  &quot;Prayer '94&quot;. &quot;Always&quot; was a big hit and is a decent  song, but not one of my favorites. &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday  Night&quot; isn't classic Bon Jovi, its not bad, but doesn't really fit.  &quot;Prayer '94&quot; is a slowed down version of &quot;Livin' on a  Prayer&quot;  I like it, it shows another side of this classic song.   Actually, it kind of brings back memories from Jon and Richie's acoustic  version of &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; from the VMA's.     All in all  this a great album.  For any Bon Jovi fan it is a must.EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT  A BON JOVI FANATIC AND THINK HE IS O.K.BUY THE ALBUM. It has classic tunes  and is ideal for cruising in your car.
B000000OF6|5.0|This Cd set is deffinently one that you should own.  When i put Greatest Hits I into my CD player i was extremely pleased to hear all of my favorite songs by Queen on the CD.  But when I put Greatest Hits II in, i was fairly  dissapointed.  It seemed like all of the good songs had been put on the  first CD and the leftovers had just been put on greates hits II.  Although  I do love the songs A Kind of Magic and Under Pressure, which were on the  2nd  cd.  I do give this set 5 stars though, because it really is the best  of Queen even if most of the best is on the first cd.
0792151712|2.0|Two studios's spent 200 million bucks for this? Overrated, and at 3 hours,overlong,a blockbuster mainly because Leonardo Di Caprio was a teenybopper heart throb and the adolescent girls paid to see it over and over,many of them numerous times.Hollywood's first version in 1953 starring Clifton Webb and  Barbara  Stanwyck in glorious black&white was simpler and a not nearly as long  and in this man's  humble opinion,a much better movie. Even better was  1958's \\"A Night To Remember\\",an excellent British docu-drama. I have both  these films in my video library,and would not want James Cameron's 1997  version.<br /><br />  Seeing it once on the big screen was enough. Cameron's  screenplay was sappy and trite and there were many mediocre computer  generated special effects.Kate Winslet and Kathy Bates were two of the few highlights.Ms. Winslet was nominated for the \\"Oscar\\" for Best Actress,unfortunately Helen Hunt won.I think Ms. Winslet is a much better actress.Di Caprio wasn't even nominated.The final scenes were indeed memorable and at times impressive.(By the way,the experts say a human can  only survive about 5 minutes before succumming to hypothermia,unlike the  way Cameron has it depicted.)James Cameron,one of Hollywood's top egomaniacs,should know less is more.
6300214753|5.0|Could this movie be the best teenage movie ever made...i think it can. There is nothing that can be said, for words could never do this movie justice. Thank the world for Matthew Brodrick.
B000002J09|5.0|I have to be honest.  I am a younger reviewer...I am only 22.  However, I love music and I definitely appreciate classic rock.  I can honestly say that I wish more younger people would appreciate legendary bands such as  Led Zepplin.  There will never be another band as talented, uninhibited and  innovative as Led Zepplin.       I am slowly but surely working on my  collection of their albums.  I just bought this album the other day and  have not been able to stop listening to it.  Plant's voice is absolutely  mesmerizing and Paige's guitar riffs are intricate and flow perfectly with  the lyrics.  Stairway to Heaven is and always will be my favorite song  simply because it proves that all rock and roll bands can have a soft  ballad without losing their true identity.  The lyrics will forever be  engraved in my memory.      But the rest of the songs must not be  overlooked.  &quot;Going to California&quot; is a song of hopes and dreams  never forgotten.  Misty Mountain Top never fails to get stuck in my mind  every time I hear it.  Black Dog is the song that really defines their  sound as pure rock...the way rock should be.  I just wish that I  appreciated their music at an earlier age.  I guess it is never too late,  though!
6301697707|5.0|Tremors, directed by Ron Underwood, is a fantastic film. Val and Earl are simply hilarious, no matter what they're doing. Aside from the two handymen, I really liked Michael Gross as the gun freak, Burt Gummer. <br />At  the time the special effects would have been considered amazing, especially  since it's budget wasn't very high. The worms are disgusting, and look  terrific. <br />I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants some  great action, funny one-liners, and who will watch it over and over again!
B000002UEB|4.0|Operation Mindcrime offers so much more than just hard rock!   It offers a great story (from beginning to end) of a man who is brainwashed into commiting political murders to make DR. Evil's fantasy world come true. It  also offers the great voice of Geoff Tate, who shows off his operatic  background, as well as some of the tightest guitar playing around.  It is  heavy metal with a hint of a soft side. A great CD for any rock fan!
6305399212|5.0|The first Alien was very unique, although it was more of a horror/sci-fi, and scared the socks of me. Aliens, made in 1986, is action all the way!<br />Ripley returns in this fantastic thriller, with a great supporting  cast which includes Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Lance Hendriksen, and Paul  Reiser. Don't miss this one, you'll never forget it!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Well, I've listened to this throughout, and I have come to the conclusion that Britney has not, done it again.  She has done something else.  It is evident that Britney has matured greatly.  Although there is a tendency for  her producer to stay with similar pop beats that have proven to be a  success, each song has its own unique style.  Throughout this album, we see  that the theme of Britney and her dealings with love/fame are quite  prominent.  It is absolutely necessary for one to approach this album with  an open mind, and not one of skepticism.  It's a listen-to, type of album,  so relax, and listen.  I'm sure it'll be a hit, played in full, over and  over again.
B000000OSW|4.0|Actually 4 1/2 stars.  After releasing 1986's excellent &quot;So,&quot; Peter Gabriel took six years to complete a new album.  The result is &quot;Us,&quot; which is an exploration of love and relationships.  Gabriel  continues his interest in world beats, incorporating African and Middle  Eastern sounds into many of the album's songs.  To be honest, the album's  impact isn't immediately obvious--the true genius lies in the subtle,  cascading melodies and gentle rolling rhythms that are gradually  discovered.  Tracks like &quot;Come to Talk to Me, &quot;Love to Be  Loved&quot; and the gorgeous &quot;Secret World&quot; percolate rather than  explode, gradually building to a release.  The lyrics are great in the  typical Gabriel fashion, and his vocals are perhaps the best of his career.   If you like Peter Gabriel and are willing to invest a little bit of time  to get to know the music, &quot;Us&quot; is a richly rewarding record.
0783237979|5.0|Superb Cast, Excellent Performance, Stage, Vocals and Production. This is a Video/Musical that you will watch again and again and again...  Hats Off to the entire cast and crew. Probably silly but I'm praying for a Sequel...
0156711427|3.0|A Passage to India is a very clever, intelligent book that brilliantly describes the racial tensions between Anglos and Indians.  The troubles Mr Fielding (an anglo) undergoes in making friends with the indians are very  real. It is very moving to read of these problems, as they represent the  many racial/economic  bridges between people which, sadly, don't seem to  close up.  I can identify with Miss Quested's feelings of not knowing the  real India.(I've never been to india, but i've read many books about it)   So, while this book is very thought provoking and describes many situations  that are easy to identify with, it is often extremely slow reading.  I  confess to skimming through many parts of the book, and I could not keep my  mind focused throughout the whole thing.  There are exciting points, such  as the events following the mystery of what really happened in the Marabar  Caves, but the plot is too extended and the book would have been much  better if it were more compressed.
B00000163G|5.0|This album is strictly emotional, &quot;mental&quot;, true to life, and just plain rap music. Did I say plain? I meant to say it's the bomb. ALL EYEZ ON ME, the song, is a good example of how rap music should sound like.  Original beats and some freak out s**t are used to make the suprerb sounds  that come out of all of the songs on this album. Tupac should have got some  kind of award for making this album so hot! George Clinton was awesome on  Can't C Me. He's pretty good with lyrics.And last but not least, Tupac is  the most respected dead rapper that has ever rapped on this damned forsaken  place we call earth. I'M done.
0060977493|4.0|This is a beautifully written book that describes the lives of two dizygotic twins and their extended family. Set amidst the exotic splendors of India which Roy so excellently describes, this novel is a wonderful  read.  I loved the language of the book and it's &quot;stream of  consciousness&quot; form which included isolated and make up words.  Some  readers may find this annoying, but I found that it greatly enhanced the  quality of the novel.    My only problem with the G of S Things was that it  is rather slow at the beginning, but stick it out.
B00004RIV4|4.0|Gone are the days when Moloko were a second rate Portishead--ever since last years hit of the summer 'Sing it Back',Moloko seem to have acquired a new confidence,with which to tell the world the 'Time Is Now',they've  arrived.This c.d. is a monster over 60 minutes long,loads of tracks and a  vast amount of musical styles.People expecting an entire c.d of the Ibiza  hit 'Sing it Back' will be dissappointed because this group seem to  ambitious than to play it safe  by sticking to one musical formula.There  are the old trip-hop influences but you can also add modern dance  music,80's pop,70's disco.Added to this the best song I've heard in years  The Time Is Now and you get one very good c.d.At times some of the lyrics  are a bit silly, but Roisin Murphy has got such a good voice that she  adapts readily to all the different styles on this album.Sometimes her  voice is strong very like Annie Lennox during her most famous time in the  mid 80's;then she's got the silky voice of a late night diva.There are  plenty of really good songs on the c.d.-each with there own distinctive  sound.All the songs have brilliant,really high quality instrumental backing  to Roisin's great voice.My only slight qualm would be that the album is a  bit too long and it does take the listener a long time to get to know the  songs--but I would recommend to anybody  to stick with it as the end result  is worth it.
6303433766|5.0|Previous to this film, director/screenwriter Peter Jackson was known for making over the top comedic horror movies like Bad Taste and Dead Alive. While those are wonderful films of their type, no one could have predicted  that he would go on to create a masterpiece of modern cinema like Heavenly  Creatures.  This is the kind of film that makes you realize how  imaginatively impoverished most other movies are.  I was shocked to  recently find out that the American version is about 15 minutes shorter  than the New Zealand release.  Here's hoping that this unique film will  someday be available in the U.S. in its full-length, original version and  letterboxed on DVD.  Soon!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This Film Is my Favorite Film OF 1999 and Everyone  should see it, The DVD Also has to be like the Best DVD of 2000.

B000005IRG|4.0|This record is excellent, but have nothing to do with punk rock. It's post-punk related with some of the least agressive of the style ; Pere Ubu, Soft Boys, Smiths. It bring some interesting ideas, but Pere Ubu also have  explored similar music in the same era. Television does it with a much more  clean sound (it's true) and there is two excellent guitar players in there.  But two tracks of the whole album sound a lot like typical 70's rock ;  Guiding Light and Prove It. Then, Thorn Curtain sound like a better Pink  Floyd. Friction seem to take a riff from a Captain Beefheart track (can't  remember the name) which can be a problem if you heard the track. It's  excellent, but it does not bring anything new to me or at least it's hard  to see what was innovative about this record in 1977. Still sound pretty  actual and is excellent!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|WOW!  After watching Cunning Stunts &amp; A year and a half in the life of...on DVD, I thought the boys had done it all.  I bought S &amp; M on CD last year and was amazed back then at how Metallica can take such a 'crazy'  idea of mixing their music with the backing of a Symphony Orchestra.  When  I got the DVD, I was even more amazed.  Seeing them all dressed smartly was  a big shock too!  They interact with the crowd as well as they always do,  they treat the crowd as if they're all personal friends.  Having seen them  live in Milton Keynes in '99, I can relate to how the crowd must have felt.   The sound is fantastic - 5.1 or 2.0 Band &amp; Orchestra or 2.0 Band or  2.0 Orchestra.  They way you can change to just listening to the Orchestra  or the band is a brilliant concept and you can see just how much backing  Metallica are actually getting.  I have given this DVD 5/5 because it is to  me, better than Cunning Stunts (altho I give that 5/5 as well!).  The wait  was definitely worth it.  To all Metallica fans, I suggest you get this  DVD.I know you'll all love it.  One thing tho, turn it up LOUD!<br />/\/eil.
B00001ZWTS|2.0|I was really excited about seeing this movie. Some people said it was good and others said it was bad. I listened to the people who said it was good. When it came out on video, I watched with my brother. It really stunk. The plot of the movie was very weak, and just to make things worse, the bad guy was so stupid I knew at the first time I saw him that this movie wasn't what I thought it was. It's basically about sex, breasts, and women's butts. It's a very dissapointing movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is pretty funny.<br />Translation:DON'T BUY THIS....!<br />Use your money on something good like The Matrix or Mission:Impossible.
B00004TH6O|5.0|...I have enjoyed this slab of desert hallucinations completely.  No this isn't Kyuss.  Not intended to be.  Instead Josh Homme has expanded his creative vocabulary.  I was especially impressed that he stayed true to the direction of the first QOTSA album.   The guitars here build a fat 200ft fuzz filled wall that cuts through a  desert of rythmic grooving basslines, eerily filling drum fills and keys to  entice even the foggiest of minds.  Josh is obviously unafraid to keep the  &quot;stoner rock&quot; label.  This is no sell out to appeal to the  mainstream.  However if the mainstream were based on talented creative  expression, this would fit in the top.  The guitar work is, as always,  simplistically perfect.  Saturated lead licks squirm through every track.   There are a lot of guest on this one to lend there own creative talents.   Same direction as the first album.  Every bit as fulfilling.  Blow your  mind, sit back, and let the Queens of the Stone Age invade you[r] psychedellic  being.

B00003CWPR|4.0|I will say that everytime I pan Tom Cruise he comes out with a great  movie.  This is probably the best acting preformance to date from Tom.His  character is so flawed and beleiveable.  Tom love his wife in the movie but  is a man who finds that unexpectedly his wife has sexual desires outside  there marriage.  Nicole Kidman preformance was much better than ever  before.  She was meant to play her role in this film, she is a strong  and  femine, but even though loyal to her husband temped by lust.  Her admission  of her desire for other men starts Cruise off on a strange but interesting  adventure when his wife tells him that she once saw a stranger so atractive  that had he asked she would have left Cruise for the him. Every encounter  leads Cruise to see a chance for infidelity (I will say no more). This is  Good Kubrick )just a step below FULL METAL JACKET and DR STANGELOOVE This  movie is not for the prudish or those who are not interested in sexual  appetites of men and women.

0671004107|5.0|Contact is not just an ordinary literary book, I've read Carl Sagan's books and Contact is the most touching of them all. I have seen the motion picture version of the novel, even though the two do not blend very well ,  the motion picture conveys the same message as the book does, science and  religion's main objective is the search for truth, whether that truth was  in a heavenly god, or the big bang and evolution, the two are not  necessarily exclusive. I have cried after reading the book, Carl invites  you to live in the life of the young scientist Ellen Arroway for which Jody  Foster has perfected her role in Contact the movie. From a stubborn child  to a pioneer scientist, every single plot is beautifully drafted. After  reading the movie I felt that everything in the world is beautiful, but not  everyone sees it. Read the novel, it is nostalgia to something this world  misses.
B000002U9L|5.0|'Allo! If you've seen the movie and love that little worm as much as I do, buy the soundtrack!  I've loved this movie from the very first time I saw the commercial, yes, I was one of the unfortunate who didn't see it until  it came on TV. My very, very favorite song is &quot;Home at Last&quot;  because I love sad music, and that is just beautiful. I also love  &quot;Sarah&quot; and the &quot;opening titles&quot;. I'm one who's not  really into dancing though, but whenever &quot;Magic Dance&quot; or  &quot;Chilly Down&quot; comes on, I'm glad I'm not in public or I would  embarass myself! HA! &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot; has always been  one of my favorites, but &quot;Home at Last&quot;, though instrumental, has  to be my alltime favorite song. I love absolutely everything about this  soundtrack, every song, every melody. Just get it ok!    =0)
B000005J56|4.0|This is the album that started all the recent Cuban craze. A simplified version of the story: Son, danzon and bolero were played in thrifty clubs in Havana before WWII and in years following it. Compay Segundo, Ruben  Gonzalez, Ibrahim Ferrer, Omara Portuondo and the rest were masters of the  art. Then in 1959 Castro liberated - or invaded, as you like it - Cuba and  virtually isolated it from the rest of the world. And while outside the  music became MTV-ized and globalized to the point where the music produced  in Sweden is indistinguishable from that made in California, the guys in  Cuba continued to do what they did best: they played son, danzon and bolero  - all until Ry Cooder discovered them in 1997 and turned them into a  success that vastly overshadowed his own musical efforts.<br /><br />Actually,  getting them together required some detective work, as some of them have  already given up their musical careers. Hardly surprising: Ruben Gonzales  is 80, and Compay Segundo is 92. Buena Vista Social Club - named after an  actual club in Havana, demolished already for decades - provides an  anthological overview of styles played 50 years ago, and the sound you  might recognize on your father's (or grandfather's) LP's. Well, almost - Ry  Cooder felt the urge to put some peronal touch on the whole thing, in form  of slide guitar (cf. &quot;Orgullecida&quot;). I wish he could resist the  temptation. Still, it's a very beautiful and romantic record, one that  makes you ask your sweetheart for a dance.<br /><br />CD comes with a 48-page  booklet, which includes bilangual (Spanish/English) lyrics and some  accompanying text. If you like this record, you might also want to check  the solo albums that followed. There is also a pseudo-documentary movie by  the same name, directed by Wim Wenders. And, go and check whether  Afro-Cuban All Stars are touring somewhere near you.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This album, along with New Order's Substance 1987, form what is to me the soundtrack of the 80's.   <br /> This album literally lives up to its title as a discography, collecting the 7&quot; versions of all of the boy's first 18  singles on one disc in chronological order.  As such, it makes a terrific  CD to buy as your first Pet Shop Boys disc as its a terrific overview of  their material.   <br /> The Pet Shop Boys wit and irony, along with Neal  Tennant's excellent voice combined to make some of the best pop songs of  the 80's.  Included are lot of well known hits like West End Girls,  Suburbia, Always On My Mind, and What Have I Done To Deserve This?.  There  are also a lot of songs here that are virtually unknown in the U.S. but  every bit as good as the afformentioned titles, such as &quot;Love Comes  Quickly&quot; - a beautiful ballad - and &quot;Heart&quot;, a song that  they had considered giving to Madonna.  Just as important, these songs have  held up well to the test of time, even though some were recorded as early  as 1984.  Through these singles, the boy's take shots at capitalism  (Opportunities), cover Elvis Presley and U2 (Always On My Mind and Where  the Streets Have No Name), sing about the Gulf War (DJ Culture), urban  decay (Suburbia), and 'rent boys' (Rent).  The music always holds up and  the lyrics display a level of intellegence unmatched by nearly every other  group - for instance, in DJ Culture Neal quips &quot;Like Liz [Taylor]  before Betty [as in the Betty Ford Clinic], She [madonna] before Sean  [Penn], suddenly you're missing, then you're reborn&quot; - and in Left To  My Own Devices, they invoke references to classical composers - &quot;Che  Guvara and Debussy to a disco beat&quot; are just a few examples.   <br />  Also, carrying the discography theme further, this album scores bonus  points as the CD booklet that comes with the album folds out to show a  chart that includes information about all the songs, including a picture ofthe single cover of each, its peak UK chart position, and a brief blurb  from the boys about each song.  I wish more compilation albums would follow  the Boy's lead in this regard.
0345350499|4.0|I am not done with this book yet but I love it already. It is such an indept epic of the Arthurian legend I just can't wait how it goes on.<br />I do like the fact that it is told mostly out of the view of the females in  this story - very well done.<br />I loved the Druids before this book but now  I enjoy and adore their religion and believes even more.<br />The bad part is  the raving of the religous and very pious Christians, like Gwynhefair,  which is almost too much to endure. I really hope they werent that bad -  but considering what came after that time (witch burning and such) I would  not be suprised.<br />Overall a wonderful book and must read for medivial ages  or history lovers.
B000001FI7|5.0|Though most call Tricky's first album Maxinquaye the trip hop era's zenith, I feel it was more fully realized on Dummy.<br />The album flows so well, and the styles here go together so well. The album literally sounds  like the soundtrack to an old spy film. The spooky and beautiful  atmospherics are great for those cold, lonely nights of winter when you  can't be close to the one you love.<br />Beth Gibbons' vocals might be a bit  of an aquired taste, but fits perfectly in with the music. Her voice  doesnt' overpower the music, and the music never overpowers her voice.<br />An  interesting tidbit, the chorus of Wandering Stars is actually that of a  Bible verse. Which one, I've no clue. But it's true, I checked on this when  a friend claimed it to me.<br />I just hope the next album is on it's way. The  1997 follow-up was a bit disappointing, but I'm still wanting to hear what  will come next.

6303433766|5.0|Somebody once said, that the novel Lolita was the only convincing love story of the century. Well, Heavenly Creatures is the only convincing cinematic love story I've seen yet. The fact this is a true story only  underscores that. It's a very twisted love story, but one none the  less.<br />This film will make you feel a lot of different emotions when  watching it. Both love and hate for the two main characters, a constant  feel of uneasiness, especially when they go into their fantasy world, among  others.<br />The ending of this film gets me like no other film I've yet seen.  You despise the girls for what they do. It's amazing how one evil act  transforms your feeling for the girls.<br />Most disgusting to me, is how real  life Juliet Hulme, has gone on to make millions of dollars a  myster  writer. Some justice, eh?<br />All-in-all, HC is probably in my top 5 movies  for the 90's. Hopefully we'll be getting a feature ladden, widescreen DVD  soon.
B00000ADG2|5.0|After buying this CD for its hype, I became an instant Lauryn Hill fan.  All songs on the CD were fantastic.  Some better than others, but all good.  My favorites are &quot;to Zion&quot;, &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &amp;  &quot;Forgive them Father&quot;.  If you like hip hop you will love this  CD!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Though I still feel Fight Club was the beter film, I will tell you, of the nominated films, American Beauty deserved to win.<br />I think this is one of most profound film in ages. Yes, it is very funny in spots, and it is a  parody of the American family, but it also features a beautiful, human  story at the end. Something that you don't see everyday in your average  comedy/parody film.<br />The drama was perfectly balanced as well, so it never  really seems too much of either a comedy or a drama.<br />Many people have  likened this film to Happiness, even saying Happiness was better and more  profound. I fail to see how that is. And unlike Happiness, the actors in  this film actually know how to act.<br />Be sure to see this more than once.  You'll catch a lot of things you missed your first time through.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Wow.  I can't say how disappointed I am by this one.  I loved Yield so I was anxiously awaiting Binaural.  There isn't even a track that I go to just to crank up.  Another reviewer had it right -- if this was a new CD by  an unknown band, we'd all probably hope all over it.  But, it isn't and I'm  not even sure Binaural will even stay in the 10-disc rotation on my card CD  player.  I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this album.  It just  seems muddy and disjointed and ultimately highly mediocre (oh and, Eddie,  about the new bleach blond look...).  Anyway, I'm not giving up -- I'm sure  I'll buy the next one and will catch the tour this fall -- but if I can't  get into the groove of Binaural over the next 3 or 4 listens, well....
B000002J20|3.0|The usual rap against this double album is the sense of massive, incomprehensible pretentiousness it conveys.  Well, if you are a prog rock follower at all, you know to expect that from damn near every band that  ever flew that particular banner.  You can't slap this in the player and  expect to snap your fingers and do the twist, you know what I'm  saying?<br />It's the *sound* of these compositions that has me on edge  sometimes, grating my teeth.  Steve Howe puts forth some truly *ugly*  guitar solos, and Chris Squire's bass has a monophonic, hollow grumbling  that sound like a Rickenbacker with a bad head cold.<br />When those two  elements aren't at their most overpowering, there's some wonderfully  pleasant and introspective music to listen to.  This is easily the most  Eastern-influenced set Yes produced, which is not surprising since John and  Steve started working on the compositions while touring in Japan.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I usually take my time and money and invest them in pop music (Cher, Britney Spears, Santana) but I decided to see what the big thing was about. I heard Savage Garden this, Savage Garden that. I had heard I Knew I Loved  You, and I Knew I Loved That Song! So I purchased the CD, only to find more  hidden treasures. Big standouts are I Knew I Loved You, Crash and Burn, 2  Beds and a Coffee Machine, Gunning Down Romance, Lover After Me, Animal  Song, Hold Me, and I Don't Know You Anymore. My advice is to purchase this  CD immediately. Each song differs from the previous and preceeding. BUY!
B000002J23|5.0|John Anderson and Rick Wakeman pulled out after the tired flat fritter that was Tormato, and were replaced by The Buggles (Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes).  70's prog rockers past their prime mixed with 80's avant garde  techno pioneers: a recipe for disaster, right?<br />Except that a miracle  happened: Horn and Downes' more restrained, more rocking approach diluted  the sometimes incomprehensible mishmash of layered production and mystical  mumbo-jumbo that represented Yes at their worst, and infused a new energy  into the band, while the veterans Howe, Squire, and White brought The  Buggles guys up several notches in terms of artistry.<br />Under 40 minutes  long, Drama is of unbelievably high quality, with pounding rhythms  interspersed with interesting little bits of reflection and repose.  It's  really a shame this album got such a bad rap (from hardcore Anderson fans?  I dunno), but the accessibility and energy of the songs can't be  denied.<br />Side comment: remember GTR?  Steve Howe and Genesis veteran Steve  Hackett joining forces with some young lions to forge a new sound?  I can't  help but think that Howe was trying to re-create the magic of Drama -- he  didn't exactly succeed, though.
6305603847|5.0|I am partially biased to this film because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, but I will put that aside for this review.  This is one of the greatest &quot;Rock Opera&quot; movies I have ever seen (if you even consider it a  rock opera).  It has brilliant cinematography.  Great effort was put in to  attention to detail.  In this film, everything is where it is for a reason.    The story is wonderful. I believe that it is something everybody can  relate to.  Building up an emotional wall to attempt to combat the horrible  things that occur in all of our lives, and the trauma that comes with the  building of this wall.  There is so much more to it than that though.  So  many references, so much deep symbolism in every scene.  Some anti-war,  anti-establishment undertones.   On top of all of this, the DVD is  wonderfully put together.  Every menu screen has been put together with a  different pink floyd song and scene from the movie.  There are many great  features, including director commentarys and makings of, interviews, cut  footage (the &quot;Hey You&quot; scene that was cut out of the film),  original trailers, production stills.  It is wonderful.   This is a  wonderful DVD to own in my opinion.  I have had it for a while now, and I  still have not finished going through everything that is on the DVD. You  won't regret this purchase.
B000000OEI|3.0|How to do it Yourself: take 1 piece of the great &quot;Hunt for the Red October&quot; Soundtrack, then add generously some deep sea-cold war-post atomic atmosphere, then mix with one pound Marianne Faithful's - in deep  black nothing sinking feelings, wagnerise powerful all the resulted stuff,  dress with russian choral cream, mix again and ... do not forget to press  down the whole stuff till it becomes boring. I tried 5 times to listen to  this album, every time my eyes closed before the fifth track. 3 stars for  the first and the third track. The second are 100 % useless.
047158651X|2.0|As a high school junior wishing to major in biochem, I read the vaunted Voet/Voet book and must say it is extremely disappointing. Although decent enough, Stryer's Biochem is much more comprehendable. And to that reader  from Sweden, biochem is NOT supposed to be more about chem than about bio.  Furthermore, it would be stupid and arrogant for a student simply to learn  about the chemistry of molecular biology and not the relevance to  biological systems...Styer does a better job of linking all those  uncomprehendable chemistry stuff into real-world biological examples...
B000001EIA|5.0|To many ballads? Silly lyrics? Common', it is a great album, maybe their best. Very good acoustics, they still work wonderful together. Kiss is still 100 % Kiss. No doubt about. And since when do we have intelectual  lyrics in rock'n roll? Common'! A 100 % must for every real Kiss soldier!
B000002MUQ|3.0|... Van Danniels, you ask?  This pertains to the current era of Van Halen, where their current manager (who began with this album) persuaded Eddie to assume Tony Iommi-ish control over the band and consequently, really begin  to mess things up in the process (No need to bring up the Roth near-reunion  or Hagar and Cherone's firing here)<br />  As for the album.  It's not nearly  as bad as it's reputation.  Is it the worst Van Hagar album?  Nope.  Carnal  Knowledge steals that honor.  Balance, at it's best, skillfully melds the  out and out rock of Carnal Knowledge with the pop sensibility (and  excellence) of OU812, and at it's worst, is downright boring, and Hagar's  voice is very rough, scratchy, and worn.  The guitar playing, by Eddie's  standards, can get quite simplistic and predictable, too.  Thankfully he'd  correct that problem, and how, on the next release.<br />  Kicking things off  is Poundcake.. er.. I mean The Seventh Seal.  Not an out and out ripoff,  but taken at the same tempo, recycling the same riff, almost makes it feel  like one.  Regardless, it is a great song.  Then come the singles, which  are the best songs on the album, Can't Stop Loving You and Don't Tell Me  (What Love Can Do), the latter which is excellent despite it's 3-note  melody which, while a nice change of pace, is hardly what we expect of  Edward Van Halen.  <br />  At worst, Balance gets very tiring.  Amsterdam is  the worst song Van Hagar ever put out.  Big Fat Money is decent for the  crank factor but very unoriginal, and the guitar leads are a joke.  Strung  Out is totally unneccesary, unlike the other two instrumentals on the album  which flat out are the best bits you'll hear this side of Eruption.  Not  Enough is the best Van Hagar ballad, Aftershock is another fine rocker,  very catchy.  They can take back Take Me Back because it's utterly cheesy..  but this album closes with a huge bang called 'Feelin... the song that Van  Halen III's Year to the Day should've been.  Thisone's a keeper.<br />   People who hate Van Halen III yet like this album, I don't understand.   They're very similar.  What saves this album is the impeccable production  by Bruce Fairbairn (something III definitley did NOT have), who turns the  focus away from the lackluster performances by Edward and Hagar and keeps  it rhythm oriented.  Alex Van Halen hasn't sounded this good since 5150.   Balance is a good album.  It has appeal.  It also has it's mistakes.   Definitley a must buy for the Van Halen fan, though.
B00000JPH5|5.0|This movie manages to be a children's classic, a long music video, and a trippy adventure all at the same time. It is enchanting, creepy, ridiculous, and it is wonderful! It creates a world that will stay with you  just as much as any Wonderland.  A must see. I mean it...
B00004SYWZ|5.0|Not only do I recommend this album, I recommend every record that A-ha has released. They've been a great band for years. It's no surprise that &quot;Minor Earth/Major Sky&quot; is a great addition to the A-ha  catologue. One of A-ha's best attributes is that their style changes with  each album but their quality remains superb. Where many bands recycle their  music from album to album, A-ha stays as fresh as they did when they  released &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; back in the mid-eighties. Don't  wander through life without hearing their music. It's among the best rock  n' roll of our time.
B000002A33|5.0|I saw some reviews for this cd on amazon.com, they were mostly in praise, so I just decided to buy it used from Wherehouse. How could anyone not shower this with praise. This cd has some of the best songs I have ever  heard. PERIOD. &quot;Dying Days&quot; and &quot;Witness&quot; are just  incredible. Of course these guys were one of Seattle's originals. And were  considered grunge with the likes of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden.  Although none of those bands sound remotely similar....they seem to have  been jumbled into an undefinable genre. The Screaming Trees do not share  any similarities with these bands either. The best way to describe them  would be &quot;phsychadelic folk rock&quot;. It sounds kind of strange. But  it makes sense when you hear them. The guitar's sing, the drums pound, and  lanegan's voice is infectiously melodic and smooth. All of the elements  flow together to create some of the most artistic and pleasing tunes ever  made. Of course this album didn't sell that much. Why? I don't know. It is  definitely intended for mature audiences. Those who can appreciate old  sixties and seventies music like Buffalo Sprinfield and others. There are  not any bad songs here, there aren't even any mediocre tunes. Everything is  above par, and very good. If you don't have this cd...then your cd  collection is worthless. GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW.
158234082X|4.0|I really liked this book. At times I was laughing out loud, atother times I was holding my breath aghast with what I wasreading. Overall it's creative and insightful, and unlike anything you've read before. It's divided into four sections: Appetizer, First Course, Second Course, Third Course, Dessert, and a Cigarette. Each is thematically a bit different.  Think of it less as a novel or book as a colleciton of essays. Essays discuss diffferent aspects of Bourdain's life: from drug addiction and first sexual/culinary experiences to his (self-)education in cooking, it's all there. One essay talks about the lingo cooks use, hilarious, another essay is about his trip to Tokyo to adapt a French menu to Japanese tastes and expectations. Another talks about his first experience eating an oyster--analogous to a first sexual experience, by all accounts. One thing that's a bit disturbing is his apparent tolerance of a great deal of homophobia and mysogyny that seems to be replete in the cooking world (of New York, at least). He kind of hems and haws about this, half defending it in a way, without accepting it necessarily. I find that kind of lukewarmness a bit troubling [. . .] But it *does* all make good reading. Always provocative and educational, its entertaining at every step. (Note to publisher: hire a copyeditor to eliminate all those typographical errors next time.)
6300214559|3.0|Such attention as the film gave to the genuine historical points, and to Jane's religious convictions (which were great) makes this well-acted drama enjoyable. Unfortunately, the far-from-true presentation of a &quot;love  story&quot; as the main focus makes the essence disappear all too often.  Jane having a great romantic passion for Dudley, and this influencing her  actions to a great degree, is far off the mark.
0780622553|4.0|When I see a movie, it's not often that I'm blown away by the sheer imagination of it. Most movies forget to be imaginative. Heck, most movies don't even make you think. This one is an exception. First off, the visuals  are spectacular. The city scapes are dark and gloomy, but what sets them  apart from movies like &quot;The Crow&quot; or &quot;Bladerunner&quot; is  that &quot;Dark City&quot; uses the style of the 30's &amp; 40's. There are  some inventive special effects during the &quot;tuning&quot; of the city  which are wonderful. Some of the characters could have used more fleshing  out, particularly Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly), but if you spend the  time listening to Roger Ebert's commentary you will understand why they  weren't. Other characters are made memorable simply because the story  allowed them to be.  Watch for the mad detective who has figured out the  &quot;tuning&quot;, and Richard O'Brien (Riff-Raff from Rocky Horror) and  Bruce Spence (Gyro Pilot from Mad Max movies) as Mr. Hand and as Mr. Wall,  two Strangers. Alex Proyas has certainly set a high standard for himself  and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. If you missed this one  at the theater, you missed out. The opening bathroom scene was gorgeous.  Not because of Mr. Sewell's behind, but because the colors were so vibrant.  This movie is likely to end up as one of those classics that is studied in  every cinema class.

0440211727|5.0|This book is John Grisham's first and by far it is his best book.  The book begins with an author's note stating that this is not his best book, but he had decided to publish it anyway.Well Grisham is wrong this is by  far the best book he has written.  I started reading late one night and  didn't put it down till I finished it late the next afternoon.  I have read  a lot of books but this is by far the one that I have read the fastest.  It  was just impossible to put down.<br />If you enjoy legal thrillers you will  certainly enjoy this story about the trial of a black man who is accused of  killing the two white men who raped his little girl.  You will feel  outrage, sorrow,triumph and joy all in 500 pages of pure emotion and nail  bitting suspense.  <br />I can say, having read both his great novels(The  Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client and The Runaway Jury) and every page of  garbage that John Grisham has written (The Chamber, The Testament, and The  Street Lawyer) that his first novel was by far his best.  He should have  simply quit while he was ahead or start writting books which he considers  not to be his best, like A Time to Kill which is by far his most enjoyable  read even if he didn't think so.

0201633612|5.0|In modern computer languages such as Java, creating Objects is a trivial task and almost as easy is making small numbers of Objects work together.  However, there is a world of a difference between coding simple programs  and developing commercial grade applications.  Complexity increases  exponentially.  Something more is required in order to keep a handle on  things.  Design Patterns largely provide that answer.<br />Initially, this  book is daunting.  At first I couldn't make head nor tail of what they were  talking about.  This revealed serious shortcomings in my own knowledge that  I had to put right but once done and starting with simple patterns (such as  the Singleton) things began to make sense.  Persevere and there is an awful  lot of knowledge to be gained here.  The intelligent application of Design  Patterns into complex systems pays off hansomely in the long run.<br />My only  critisisms of the book?  Fairly minor really.  The diagrams are all  pre-UML.  In fact they are they're own version of OMT diagrams.  And an  over reliance on Smalltalk for providing examples.  <br />In the five years  this book has been published much new work has been done on Design Patterns  and it's time for a new edition of the book.  Nevertheless, there aren't  many computing books that are five years old and still of prime relevance.   This is one.
B00004TL2N|5.0|I have been waiting for the release of this performance since I first heard of its recording in September of 1996.  For anyone tracking the recordings of Pierre Boulez, the typical reaction upon hearing that he had recorded a Bruckner symphony is: \\"Boulez conducting Bruckner?\\"  I've been a fan of many of Boulez's recordings for Deutsche Grammophon and so I was very curious to hear his version of this, my favourite of Bruckner's symphonies.  I had read his reason for making the recording was  that he thought rather highly of the Adagio.  I was half expecting to find  a recording that rushed through the first two movements only to perform the Adagio, and then breeze through the finale as well.  Knowing how dull a performance can sound when Boulez is disinterested in the piece, and how he can at times sound too clinical, I was a bit worried about what this  account may bring. Well, now that I've heard this recording, I can rest easy.  It is one of the most impressive accounts of the Eighth symphony I've ever heard.  My introduction to this piece was through Herbert von Karajan's last recording (of four) of this piece, with the Vienna  Philharmonic.  Boulez also records with the same orchestra, and they perform with the same transcendent beauty here as they did with Karajan soon before his death. There are many differences between the two recordings.   Karajan's is slower and is thus represented on two discs, significantly increasing the cost.  It is still a favourite of mine, even after having heard easily a dozen other recordings.  However, when people would ask me for a recommendation for this piece, they would balk at the  price of Karajan's recording.  Well, now I can wholeheartedly recommend Boulez's account on a single disc, and thus half the price. Boulez's performance is deeply felt and on numerous occasions sent chills over my body, in the same way Karajan's did, but for different reasons.  Karajan's recording has more mystery and sounds more spiritual.  Boulez's is more rhythmic and pressing and intense while still flowing and allowing the passages to breath.  It's a superb performance and if I were pressed to  choose between the two, I would choose the Boulez.  For me, this performance is somewhere between Karajan's account and Furtwangler's 1944 account, also with the Vienna Philharmonic.  It combines better sound than Karajan's with a less eccentric but still close interpretation to Furtwangler's.  (This is probably the only time a comparison between Furtwangler and Boulez could be made!)  I'm sure someone will come along, as often is the case, to proclaim that Boulez has a heart of stone and doesn't plumb the depths of emotion in this work, but to my ears this is a desert island performance of Bruckner's greatest symphony.
630587493X|5.0|I first read the short story by Asimov when I was 13.  It was a tale which gave life to my belief that even though we may be downtrodden, subjected to others direction in our lives and our lack of it, there is hope.  The movie  does the story justice beyond what most would.  It shows that we can,  someday through hard work and perserverance, become that which we so strive  to be.  Human. It shows, also, that being human is less a matter of what we  look like than how we feel, and who we are. A movie, and short story, that  I would recommend to the youngest and oldest of us all.
B00000HYXB|4.0|When I first picked up this CD and popped it into my stereo, I couldn't even get into it. Know why? There's simply too much going on to grasp it all in one listen! This grew on me more and more every time I listened to  it and now I rate it as one of the best power metal albums of all time! The  showcases of the CD (in my opinion) are - &quot;Into the Storm&quot;,  &quot;Nightfall&quot;, &quot;The Curse of Feanor&quot;, &quot;Mirror  Mirror&quot;, &quot;Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)&quot;, &quot;Time Stands  Still (at the Iron Hill) (the best track of them all!), and &quot;The  Eldar&quot; is just beautiful. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars  is because I think the last few songs cannot match the dynamism of the  first half of the CD. But all in all these guys are brilliant, and Hansi  Kurch's voice is awesome!

B000002NIW|5.0|Out of all of my CDs, LPs and Cassettes, over 400 in all, I can still pick this one out and listen to Lotion or Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) and be moved. This is inspiring metal, emocore to be exact, the kind of music Fred  Durst or Kid Rock could never make. Brutally raw from the start, a sound  clip could easily suggest noise. But down underneath the aggressive guitars  lay Chino's lyrics and emotions, strung out amongst Chi's very tolerable,  almost addictive bass. Abe's drumming pulverizes the music and shrieks  until you can hear every beat. These descriptions may be worthy of Napalm  Death et al, but this music is much better. Forget anyone who ever had to  do with the mainstream, and plug your ears to this. Chino's vocal can make  you cry, then the next second make your head bang, then switch back. This  is easily my third favorite album, and second for album of the year in  1997, only behind Incubus' thrashing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Check them out on tour  this summer in support of their new album The White Pony. They will be with  Glassjaw. Also be sure to look for Taproot, onelinedrawing, and [minus]
B000002KAT|5.0|This album could be described as scrappy - recorded in under two days, there are mistakes which are certainly not part of Van Morrison's journey &quot;into the mystic&quot;. But while with more time the players (himself  included) could have been more note-conscious, the immediacy would  undoubtedly have been lost. Here we have a man singing with such passion -  at times overbearingly passionate, in the same way that Bob Dylan's  harmonica is really not good when you're nursing a hangover. You only have  to compare this seminal work from the 60's with any number of  &quot;important&quot; 90's albums, which have perhaps as much musical  worth, but so much production, mixing and re-mixing that the content  becomes joyless.<br />And then, there is simply the beauty: simple beauty, as  it must always be. The opening song, when I first heard it, heralded the  opening of a new chapter in my musical experiences - never before had I  heard something so simple, so right. In some (undoubtedly pagan way) I  compare the repetitive bass structures of the album to U2's all-time most  popular song With or Without You - there, very simple things produce a very  powerful musical effect, which even the most cynical (like myself) find  difficult to dislike. The difference here, of course, is that Van Morrison  is anything but simple, and the rhythms on songs like Beside You and The  Way Young Lovers Do are extremely challenging. And thrilling - I always  want to leap and start dancing with the nearest girl when Young Lovers  comes on...it's that kind of song.<br />And as for lyrical beauty, combined  with musical excellence, Madam George and Sweet Thing (the only song I  recognised from his greatest hits, which I bought first...what a different  kind of artist he has proven to be!) must hit the spot - when the tears  have to be blinked away, that's always a sure indicator.<br />As someone else  has written below, here is a work that lies closer to jazz than rock...but  a fusion with someone of such pure musical vision at its centre was bound  to succeed. I also believe it is a credit to the sophistication of a  greater part of the listening audience in the UK (at least)that it was  recently voted for in Q Magazine as the third most influential British  album ever. Tomorrow is now, but yesterday is forever young...rock on!omeone of such pure musical vision at its centre was bound  to succeed.

0156528207|5.0|Some children may enjoy this curiously poignant European tale, but I think it is more aimed at adults, with its gentle parodies of grown-up life, its metaphysical ending, and its parables against fascism (the Baobab trees.)  The drawings are a delight, and the messages about human love are  important. If read in English, the book can be finished at a sitting.
B00003CX5A|5.0|All I'll say about the movie is that is was entertaining, scary, good, what makes this movie excellent is the techniques Burton used.  The movie is almost in black &amp; white.

0446677450|4.0|First of all, I liked the ideas in this book.  They excited me and made me tell all my family and friends about it.  I bought copies for my mom and my brother.  I then bought the sequel to this book, Cashflow Quadrant.  I even  went to see him speak at a seminar in Manhattan.  His ideas are exciting,  fundamentally sound, and candid.  However, I left the seminar with a bad  taste in my mouth.<br />Everyone lined up for autographs at the end of the  seminar, I lined up as well.  I had only one question for him,....  &quot;Who is your Rich Dad?&quot;  I wanted to know who the man was that  supplied him with this valuable information.  I also thought that he would  want to immortalize his &quot;Rich Dad&quot; for all his teachings.  Instead, I got a terse answer that the information about his Rich Dad was  private.  Fine, it's private, but why?  Worst case scenerio, Kiyosaki's the  modern day music man.  Selling books and ideas that brightens the lives of  the people that use them, while using a possibly false and misleading  marketing tool.<br />I hope there is a Rich Dad, the ideas in Kiyosaki's  books are great.  I would hate to think of him manufacturing some slick and  emotional marketing scheme to sell the amalgamation of all his accumulated  knowledge and referrring to it as Rich Dad.  But, even if that is the case,  the books do hold valuable and exciting information to  help you start  planning your road to financial freedom.  I guess, I just want do my  research on who gives me advice...If any one has any idea who his  &quot;Rich Dad&quot; actually is, I would like to know.
0374115370|2.0|I'm not sure why this book got so many five star reviews.  It's not a terrible book, but I found it to be incrediably predictable and dull. I had pretty much figured out everything that was going to happen within the  first hundred pages or so.  There wasn't much point in finishing it.  I  love long books, but this one was pointlessly so.  Wolfe goes into a lot of  useless rambling that has little if nothing to do with the plot.  I found  myself skimming many of the pages without feeling I has missed out on  anything important.  Definately the sort of book you read only if there is  nothing else around.
B000002L5P|5.0|This album is definitely one of my all-time favorites. The Queen is Dead may have more polish, but i like the edgier sound you get on songs like the amazing \\"Hand in Glove\\" or \\"miserable lie\\", which  boasts morrissey's stunning falsetto as it speeds up to its awe-inspiring  climatic ending. The falsetto on this track as well as \\"What  Difference Does it Make?\\" add to this album's specialness.  This album  is laced with tracks that work for me, whether they seem to be rock, pop,  or even punk. \\"This Charming Man\\" and \\"reel around the  fountain\\" are obvious classics, but my personal favorite will always be \\"Still Ill\\". Speaking frankly this may be the best song ever written.  Morrissey's lyrics and performance are devastating enough to leave me breathless every time i hear this and Marr, Joyce, and  Rourke back it all up perfectly. It's a story of love lost and failed expectations and i only wish music would always sound this good.  This album alone would make me consider the smiths as one of the greatest bands of all time. Their work that followed carves it into stone. You may never  hear something so innocently beautiful as this album.  Sometimes greatness  like this just happens.
B00003CWTH|5.0|Magnolia was magnificent - as if on a sprawling canvas of celluloid,  painter P.T. Anderson has given us a masterpiece.  (It was no coincidence that the Academy Awards snubbed this film - it simply had too much depth  and breadth.)  Considering the 2 films last year dealing with somewhat  similar subject matter - the dysfunction in our families, hence society -  \\"Magnolia\\" makes \\"American Beauty\\" look like kindergarten. Its rich and  complex look at the lives of a handful of folks living in Los Angeles' San  Fernando Valley give the art of screenwriting and character development  it's due.  The performances, all of them, are intricate and flawless.  The  story is riveting and complex, and contrary to what the first reviewer said  about the film's \\"freak natural&quot; phenomenon - it is not natural and is  not intended to be taken as such.  The whole point of the film from  beginning to end - is that there is too much Meaning and Purpose evident in  life for events to be termed \\"accidental,\\" \\"random\\" or &quot;freak  natural.&quot;  Without giving away the amazing ending - see it for  yourself! - Anderson's entire point is that we should look beyond \\"nature,\\"  finally, for our answers.
B000000WA2|5.0|Blur's previous record 'Parklife' was a humorous and honest study of the British working class, and the 'The Great Escape' does the same for the white-collar professional. Some of Blur's best work is on this album. 'Charmless Man' and 'The Universal' are memorable singles but obscure fan favourites like 'He Thought Of Cars', 'Fade Away' and the frenetic 'Could Be You' are even better tunes. If you liked 'Modern Life Is Rubbish' and 'Parklife' then buy this record. If on the other hand you prefer the indie sound of Blur, then you'll find '13' more to your liking.
B00004RITP|5.0|This recording of Mahler's unfinished symphony has some very fine things in it. <br />As I was only slightly familiar with the adagio from a previous recording,(I cannot recall the details thereof), which I had heard a long time ago, I did not know what to expect of this recording. <br />It is based on the score reconstructed from Mahler's sketches by the English scholar and Mahler expert, Deryck Cooke. What emerges is very impressive, especially the two scherzos which surround the short and diabolical middle movement - Purgatoria. <br />The emotional intensity which typifies many of Mahler's symphonic works is there in the first and last movements, especially in the powerful discordant passages near the end of the first movement. <br />I am very keen to get to know this work as initmately (through this CD) as I know most of Mahler's other great symphonies and would recommend this CD very highly indeed!
0345363132|5.0|Penman is the greatest historical fiction author I have ever read and I believe that this is her best book.  She does a great job of presenting an alternate viewpoint to the story of Richard III.  I find it to be very  admirable that Penman is able to include so much detail in her books  without becoming pedantic and dull.  Her stories are full of action and  intrigue and are in no danger of becoming the dry histories that are so  cocmmon in her genre.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I first saw Fantasia as a child.  I loved it then and I love it now.  The wonderful music, vibrant animation, and a lack of dialog make this a true trip into fantasy and imagination.  I even like the very dated introduction as it explains to young audience members the concept behind the film - to  take music and create images than show visually the feelings that the music  evokes.  All music is written to get across some message to the audience,  and this film provides an excellent way for children to understand this  concept thru the medium of animation. Although &quot;The Sorcerers  Apprentice&quot; is the best known sequence, my sister and I liked the  dancing oriental mushrooms the best.  The &quot;A Night on Bald  Mountain&quot; sequence is a bit scarry for little kids, but the rest is  wonderful for all ages.  I consider this one of the best movies Disney has  ever made.
6301008960|5.0|It's a must see and have movie!  It has a great moral lesson for all ages, especially high school kids. It's also a cute movie. I'm disappointed that it's not available for purchase, but if it is I would definitely buy  it for myself and my teenage nieces!
0060926317|5.0|It is a great honor and privilege to be introduced to the Real People through Marlo Morgan's book Mutant Message. The clarity and wisdom of the Real People's teachings have validated and deepened my own spiritual  journey. I've even added a morning prayer of thanks to The Oneness. Mutant  Message is a global celebration.
B00004TH6O|4.0|to be honest, i expected another album like the first qotsa record, and i would have been fine with that.  what i got was something suprisingly different and refreshing.  this is a great album, with some new material  that really covers the gauntlet.  you get everything from soaring melodies,  to slamming walls of sound, and a bit of something that sounds like *punk*  or whatever you want to call it.  all i know is that this is a great record  that you can listen to over and over again....definitly worth the  bills.<br />p.s.  if you give QOTSA a low rating because they don't sound like  Kyuss, well...see you auntie.
0061020710|5.0|Pratchett's Discworld novels are incrediably diffrent and creative.  These books are great little satires that will make you laugh outloud.  I am reminded of Piers Anthony's Xanth novels, however, Pratchett's humor comes  across as more mature than the bombardment of puns found in Anthony's  books.  I recommend these books to anyone who has read and enjoyed Xanth in  the past, but are ready for something a little more grownup.
B000002J0B|5.0|Well, since being recently changed into a Zeppelin junkie, I went out and bought this album due to some strong reviews and plus, I wanted to hear what &quot; The Rain Song &quot; sounded like. Well, I must admit, I was  pretty suprised. &quot;The song Remains the Same&quot; Is a pretty good  opening tune. Jimmy does some lead work that is brilliant, and Bonzos drums  are ripping. Then, &quot;The Rain Song&quot;. This song, is very serene and  beautiful. It sounds classical, yet, at the end, it just rocks, and the  string sections added just makes it a masterpiece. &quot; Over The Hills  and Far Away&quot; should be THE song to play people who have never really  heard of Led Zeppelin. It combines the acoustic folk side, with the  balls-to the wall-electric side, along with some soaring vocals. Definatly  a classic. The Crunge sucks, Dancing days kicks, and so does the Ocean. No  Quarter is wierd. I ran out of words.
B000002HMH|3.0|I guess the &quot;sell out&quot; naysayers have been shredded enough here, and elsewhere, but I have something else to say on this subject, anyway. First of all, let me say that, no, I'm not crazy about this album or the  artistic direction that Metallica has taken with this album and  &quot;Re-load.&quot; That said, claiming that they have &quot;sold  out&quot; - which is, by the way, the oldest, most common, and most ASININE  criticism, ever thrown at rock bands - is patently ridiculous. Crying,  &quot;sell out,&quot; has always struck me as exceedingly lame, but it's  only after hearing this criticism hurled at Metallica, mainly by their most  disloyal, numb-skulled, so-called &quot;fans,&quot; WAY TOO OFTEN, that I  felt compelled to call B.S., once-and-for-all, on the &quot;sell out&quot;  thing.<br />First of all, let's define &quot;sell out,&quot; as it pertains to  Rock-and-Roll (or any form of art, for that matter), shall we? A band has  &quot;sold out&quot; if they have... 1) compromised their own artistic  beliefs, by going with the popular trend, mainly for the purpose of making  more money. 2) given in to greedy recording label executives' wishes, even  though it goes against the band's own artistic direction. I can guarantee  you that neither of these scenarios has happened with Metallica, and I can  also guarantee you that, historically, either of these scenarios has  probably actually happened only a small percentage of the time that a  &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;successful&quot; band has been accused of  &quot;selling out&quot; by disgruntled fans who are allergic to ANY sort of   stylistic change that a band might make.<br />Metallica certainly doesn't  need any more money, and they've never done anything that would indicate  that money is more important to them than the music; and anyone who has  paid any real close attention to the things these guys have said and done  over the years would know that changing their musical style just to give into the greedy wishes of a record label, is just NOT their style - besides  the fact that this hard-working band has paved its own way enough that I'm  sure they have earned a considerable amount of autonomy with their record  label over the years.<br />As far as this album goes, yes, I like the  &quot;old&quot; Metallica better. But this &quot;new direction&quot; is not  about &quot;selling out,&quot; it's about a band getting further back to  its roots, which is an impulse that many a great rock band has taken  somewhere along its path. And while most of these songs don't do much for  me, there's nothing here that smells of lack of passion or conviction,  which would be tell-tale signs of a &quot;sell out.&quot; If you don't like  this music, don't listen to it, but stop making accusations that don't make  sense.
B00000JCB2|5.0|i got this cd ok? and it has such a sound that is so insanly good. trust? is a bitter song to love at it all. well this cd is waiting for you to buy so BUY IT!
0804106304|5.0|is not being able to read it for the first time again. <br />I picked this book up on a whim. It was on my freshman summer reading list and I figured 'what the heck, I don't know that much about Chinese culture'. And I was  suprised. <br />The book is basically a bunch of linked stories about four  woman and their daughters. These seven women (one of the mothers has  recently died) tell two stories from their past, and for some of the  daughters their present, that weave together to make one big Chinese modern  fairy tale. My favorites had to be 'The Red Candle', 'Two Kinds', 'Rice  Husband', and 'Magpies', but all were very good. <br />And even if you aren't  Chinese, and don't know anything about them, Amy Tan's poetic language will  basically float you through this book like a calm river. She writes with  wonderful talent and I will definately be reading one of her books again,  that will hopefully be just as good as this one.
0446677450|2.0|To sum it up.  Save your money.  Invest it in assets.  Do not spend more than you have. Duh. <br />The potential knowledge you could derive from this book would be less than that of a typical high school education. Author  spends a good portion of the book pimping his other wares.  It was a waste  of my time.
B00004THAY|5.0|You can read other reviews here that comment on the excellent playing and signing by both blues greats.<br />I would like to comment on the way this album was mixed - EC's vocals and playing come from the left channel and BB  from the right.  All other sounds seem to be well balanced between right  and left.<br />I really enjoyed this effect - it gives the performances an  almost live sound.  With a decent home system (some digital sound fields)  you can almost see EC &amp; BB smiling back and forth as they play in a  classic blues small venue.
B00003CWOL|4.0|One strong piece of advice:  If you are a devout Catholic with no sense of humor, PLEASE avoid this film at all costs. I am a Catholic with a (questionable) sense of humor. However, devout ? Probably not. Yet, I  enjoyed the satirical point of view by the writers on all religions they  take a jab at here. Period.Unfortunatley,the Catholic religion took the  most jabs in this film.Is it because it happens to be one of the biggest  religions on the face of the earth ? Hmm. The meaning or possible message  of this film is who is man to put himself above the very faith they believe  in and use it as a leverage to bully others. Yet, be hypocritical about the  same rules or regulations they support or uphold by their own writings. In  other words, you cannot be a bible thumper, yet, get caught at a nudie bar  and expect to pass judgement onto others. <br />The end result is comedy that  will make some flinch and others laugh hysterically. However effective, the  message is still plain and simple. Yet, it is ambiguous to  others.<br />Whether or not Alanis Morrisette's presence thrown in as a  &quot;special guest&quot; is irreverant or irrelevant remains to be decided  by the viewer...Remember, folks, the phrase, &quot;tongue in  cheek&quot;?...
B00004TH6O|5.0|I don't even need to hear the next 6 months of releases. If Nirvana still existed, this is what I'd like to think they'd release for the new century, a solid, crunchy, collection of songs that are heavy as lead and have hooks  all over the place. &quot;Feel Good Hit Of The Summer&quot; is this  century's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and despite what somebody  said in these reviews, &quot;Monster..Parasol&quot; is a great great song  that leads into the best song on the album in my opinion - &quot;Quick And  To The Pointless&quot;. If you were impressed with the first Masters Of  Reality CD on Def American or you just want to hear catchy great riffs with  an overall cool vibe - get this, you WILL NOT regret it.
B00004RFFI|4.0|Yes it's true, the plot is weak and there are numerous mistakes in the film, like hair not blowing when it should and a windshield appearing broken, then not, then broken again in a few seconds span.  Nevertheless,  the sound effects on this film are incredible and the visual effects are  excellent!<br />I had previously borrowed a friends Dolby Digital version and  now have purchased the DTS version and the difference is noticeable.  While  the DD version is an excellent representation of the sound, it is much  richer sounding with fuller bass effects on DTS.  The thunderclaps coming  from either side of the rear channels really immerse you into the  action.<br />Definitely a must have if you have a DTS compatible player and  receiver.  This will replace Saving Private Ryan-DTS as my home theater  demonstration movie when friends visit.
B00003OSSM|5.0|As both a Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas fan, I loved and purchased &quot;Random Hearts.&quot; As the tag-line says, &quot;In a perfect world...they would have never met.&quot;<br />Dutch Vandenbrock (Ford)  and Kay Chandler (Scott Thomas) are brought together by tragic fate; losing  their spouses in a plane crash. Their pain is deepened when it is revealed  their spouses were having an affair together. <br />He's a cop obsessed with  finding the truth and she's a Congresswoman who represses her  feelings.<br />Without giving the end away, I liked it because it was not  predictable. I thought it was very well acted, directed, and  written.<br />This is the first movie I have seen with Kristin Scott Thomas  and I am very impressed. She is classy and an outstanding actress. I have  since purchased &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;Four Weddings and a  Funeral&quot; and &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot; With co-stars such as  Ralph Fiennes, Robert Redford, Hugh Grant, and Harrison Ford--she's got the  charisma and talent, along with her co-stars, to make any movie an  excellent one.
B00003CWPR|3.0|This is the first movie in my film watching history, when asked by someone what I thought of it, I like to answer with a yes or no or maybe; I just love to get a rise out of them by answering just the opposite of what they thought of it ! It's JUST A MOVIE ! There may be questions or plotholes and  bizarre scenes with meaningless situations big enough to compare with the  Holland Tunnel...  The fact of the matter is, and for the  record, for me personally it was pure sublime entertainment.It was a  sleeper movie (pun intended for some) in which the pshychological aspect of  it kept me hooked.I often found myself asking how far will Tom Cruise's  character go to spite his wife even though she was only unfaithful to him  in thought ? True, the action, well, there was none, took form in the  mental sense keeping the viewer wondering who would commit the final  physical act of deception. Eyes Wide Shut posed a very endearing and  timeless psychological and moral question for not just married couples but  for everybody. The question is whether or not we can differentiate between  our fantasies and desires versus our needs and wants (not just in the  carnal sexual sense) ? In other words, do we as humans sometimes find  ourselves blurring the distinction between fiction and fact ? Of course we  do. The &quot;real&quot; trick is separating ourselves from actually  carrying out these dangerous desires before the damage is done and letting  them turn into an obsession bearing remorseful consequences...<br />The  scenery or sets (particularly the mansion of the masked society) was very  artistic in the sense as though I felt I was looking at a surrealistic  painting. The atmosphere was very reminiscent of an Enigma music video. The  soundtrack was nowhere near the brilliance of a Vangelis score. Yet, with  the simple 2 or 3 piano keynotes, much emotion and drama was conveyed.<br />Do  I highly recommend this movie to everyone (colleagues, friends, family,  etc.)? Of course not. Is it a waste of any viewer's time ? Depends on the  viewer's time and mind...
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is much better than the Slim Shady LP.  The beats are much more fitting to Eminem.  His lyrical ability has also improved.  This album is much less commercial than the first.  Yes, he does have a lot of hype  around him, and that does help sell records, but I bought this album  because I see his lyrical ability.  Dr.Dre saw his talent and so do I.  The  bottom line is that Eminem is an excellent mc, and can write very  entertaining songs.  Regardless of his skin color, it is like he said,  &quot;I just spit better than 90 percent of you rappers out there.&quot;  -The Real Slim Shady.
B00001ZWTS|5.0|Before it came out on video last year, i was hoping they would include the music video after the movie just like they did for MEN IN BLACK, and i must say it was worth the wait. My title for this review says it all.
630587493X|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. It takes place over the span of 200 years. As a robot evolves to &quot;more than the sum of its parts&quot;, he discovers the magic that defines us individuals and spritual beings. He  longs to feel as we do (or as some of us should) and goes on a journey that  will permit him to do so. There are some similarities present, in this  movie, that have been seen in other stories in regards to robots and  adroids. Asimov's laws of robotics for instance. All in all it is very well  done. I would recommend this for 15 years of age or older. Only because I  doubt the script would hold the attention of too many people younger than  that.
0792846338|4.0|This is one of the sweeter Stephen King adaptions,I mustsay.Kathy Bates didn't win Best Actress in '90 for nothing!Thechemistry between her and Caan is just awesome, and is beatifully set off, while not overshadowed by Rob Reiner's tense direction.he refuses to let the suspense up for a solitary minute, making this join THE SHINING for best big screen adaption of the Master of Macabre.No matter how many times ya see this, the scene inwhich Annie 'hoobbles' Paul, cracking his ankles with a sledgehammer when they're already broken, just makes your gut lurch!Classic suspense pic, w/ perfect comedic relief by town sheriff Buster.Check this out, but have a change of drawls next to the JiffyPop!
B000024D4R|5.0|I think this CD is one of the best Pink Floyd Albums there is.  I'm a pretty new Pink Floyd fan and I only got five of there albums, but I think this is an outstanding CD.  The first and last songs are great.  The  seventeen minute classic Dogs is wonderful.  Pigs and Sheep are great songs  also.  I recomend this CD to anybody who heard a Pink Floyd song and liked  it.
0767903854|4.0|Bill Bryson has a extraordinary narative sense and he has the ability to make potentially dull subjects exciting. In this most recent book he gives us the guided tour of Australia, it's scenic and adventurous side, and also  it's mysterious side. I feel I learned a lot from this book and it  certainly was fun to read. I would recommend it.
B000002BYD|5.0|With the opening chords of &quot;Brain Of J,&quot; it seems that YIELD will be a stripped down and garage-sounding record.  This feeling also comes in the sly &quot;Do The Evolution,&quot; with its rugged guitars and  vocals and the all-too-short rocker &quot;MFC,&quot; but there's much more  variety than just this.  All of the songs contain Vedder's usual witty and  social lyrics, but musically every song has its own personality.  In  &quot;No Way,&quot; it feels like the band is playing in the middle of a  remote desert, and Vedder is debating whether or not he's going to return  to the absurdities that make up everyday life.  YIELD also contains the  rock anthems similar to those on TEN that many fans want to hear again and  again.  The arena-ready sound and vocals from &quot;Alive&quot; and  &quot;Evenflow&quot; are found on the story &quot;Given To Fly,&quot;  &quot;Faithfull,&quot; and &quot;In Hiding,&quot; which has a chorus that  brings goose-bumps to my arms every time I hear it.  The ballads &quot;Low  Light&quot; and &quot;Wishlist&quot; aren't typical slow moving tracks with  a rousing chorus.  Instead they rely more on odd lyrics and beautifully  paced rhythms to stand up with other similar Pearl Jam classics like  &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Nothingman.&quot;  The only song to skip over  is &quot;Pilate&quot; because its meaningless subject and humor doesn't  stand up with the more clever and mature material on this record.  It's  obvious that Pearl Jam went back to an approach similar to TEN probably to  gain the sales they say don't matter to them, but YIELD expands upon their  previous albums while keeping the past in mind.  Even after listening to  BINAURAL, my vote for best Pearl Jam album has to be YIELD since it  contains all the elements that make this band so important.
B000023VR6|5.0|it seems that Dre is still on fire.. he made one of the best hip-hop albums this year. the beats and the rythems are out of this world! with assistance of real rappers ( snoop and eminem). this album reminds me the  golden  years of hip hop. the track &quot; still d.r.e&quot; is blazing in  any place in the world and beatz keep people bouncing from Asia through  middle east and Europe to the US
B000002L80|3.0|Probably teh best qualities about this recording are thespecial arrangements and some oddball David Byrne lyrics.  The lead tracks And She Was, Road To Nowhere, and Stay Up Late are the strengths of the disc most  notably the middle tracks ocapella opening.  Walk It Down as an interesting  bass line and Creatures Of Love is kind of spunky and doesn't take up too  much listening time.  The rest of the songs do not offend me but in the  same respect do not have much memorable about them either.  The  instrumental backing and vocals are creative, a bit unusual but not all  that good with a few exceptions as noted above.  Truthfully Elvis Costello,  The Pretenders, Joe Jackson, and a few other new wave artists seem to have  more talent going for them than this act.  But these guys(and girl) are not  bad.  They have their niche and big fans of them will like this record.  However, outsiders to this style could pass on this batch very easily.
1559409010|5.0|someone once said,&quot;If your stupid, you think Monty Python is funny.  If your intelligent, you think Monty Python is really funny.&quot; However, if you can't see past the fact that they are writing an extremely witty  satire of those who exploit religion for thier own political agenda, and  those who blindly follow religion without ever thinking things out for  themselves first, then this quote dosen't apply to you.  certain religious  groups held their own Spanish Inqusitions for this film, and they are about  as accurate as the original one.  the Pythons have written a brilliant  script, combined with immaculate preformances.  every scene is full of  classic characters, biting satire, and wonderful comedy that remains  Python's finest movie. For me (as comedy is quite personal) this will  always be the funniest comedy ever, unless you are an ignorant moron who  isn't clever enough to figure out that Monty Python is mocking you, not  Jesus (who, incidently, is portrayed quite normally, and referres to as  preforming a miracle)  Buy this one, as no intelligent person should be  without it.
6305531374|2.0|That's all I have to say.This is no Halloween part 1,a gem of a slasher  movie,but it's better(WAY better)than Halloween 6,which was a scary as  well,but plodding and an unoriginal piece of tripe that leaves you  scratching your head in befuddlement.<br />  It's twenty years later and  Micheal has come back for another round of mass murder.This time he manages  to pull it all off with style,and much suspense abounds.Originality is  still a problem however,as this is a virtual composite of Halloween 1,and  2,Black Christmas,Friday the the 13th parts 1,2,3,and 4,and Scream and I  Know What You Did Last Summer too of course.Nothing really new here see,and  it does miss out on some chances to shake up the audience favoring some  rather dull stretches of exposition.<br />  The last thirty minutes borders  continually on dumb but a somewhat unexpected twist in the end and some  smatterings of the original Halloween theme more or less make up for  this.Ultimately this comes off as a diverting retread with fresh faces and  Jaime Lee back in scream queen mode to spice things up.Worth at least a  rental.
B00003CX6P|5.0|This movie is not at all what I expected.  I thought it was going to be just another un-original thriller, I was definately wrong.  It is a deeply character driven psychological drama, with many twists.  The director  invites us to enter the head of Mr. Ripley (Matt Damon), who has some  psychological issues, he is not happy with who he is, so he pretends to be  someone else.  This is where the conflict begins, because it brings up some  serious problems and tension.  Mr. Ripley is one of the most well written  characters I have seen in a movie, period.  I have never seen such a deep  character.  Not to mention the beautiful scenery, cinematography, music and  editing that the movie has.  The wonderful acting just adds to this  disturbing and thought provoking treat.  The movie also teaches us not to  pretend and be who we are, because even though it is hard, a lie will stick  with you and be harder.  If you haven't seen this movie, give it a try,  it's most likely not what you expect.<br />The DVD also has some nice  features.  Highly Reccomend.
B00000INEX|5.0|My husband and I bought this video for our son when he was 7 months old.  Since he found classical music soothing and I played a few Bach pieces on the piano, I thought he'd recognize the music.  He absolutely loved it!  I  remember how he used to crawl over to the tv every time he heard it  starting.  He especially loved the robots.  Now he's 20 months old, and has  grown with the video.  He now names objects and repeats sound effects.     He owns the entire series and they are all great in their own right, But  Baby Bach will always be special because it was the first one he owned.     I don't understand why people have such a problem with Julie Clark's  daughters being in the video.  We love watching them grow in the series  just like we love watching our own son grow.  And our son learned to clap  his hands and play peek-a-boo by watching the girls in the video do it over  and over again.    I wish we would've had this video when our son was  newborn.
0345349571|5.0|I read this book in 1989 and it has had a profound effect on how I view the Middle Ages and indeed how I understand history in general.  It really is a fascinating book, so intelligent and very readable.  I cannot  recommend it highly enough.
6301562925|1.0|Not worth yur time.Baffling attempts to mix in a little screw ball comedy  fail on all counts and bring the movie down further along with Wendy Kaplan  who's character Tina is too ditzy for her own good.The writers should know  better.<br />  The barn yard scene and the laundry chute scene however are  refreshingly scary and suspenseful.The John Carpenter feel of the first  abounds in theses segments.<br />  The movie ends in anticlimax though and the  &quot;twist&quot; ending is laughable and as incomprehensible as the bland  6th outing.
B000002MI4|5.0|Having come to appreciate EC later on in my listening (and his career) I was able to feast upon many albums at once. This one, I find to stand out because it shows that music truly is art. Art, to me, means creating  something unique and at the same time, pleasing.  What's even more  enjoyable is the story about how these guys all got together (story found  in the insert) and to hear music for music's sake. You can hear these guys  just having fun at working. Get it and enjoy another type of classical  rock!
B00000JCOV|5.0|the best slipknot cd yet. the beats are increadible, because almost all nine people in the group play the bass. heavy, but and increadible metal cd. any korn fan would love this cd.
6305903182|3.0|Zero scares,but I like to think of this in terms of a comedy.Parker Posey  steals the show as the halirious Jennifer Jolie.This is neither as dull and  predictable as Scream 2,nor gratingly self-consious as in Scream 1(VERY  watchable though,I guess).This has it's fair share of stupid and silly  moments but it keeps you intrested all the way through to the end!<br />   Looking for great horror?Look elsewhere.Looking for a great teen comedy  with mild suspense washed in for good measure.Look no further!
B00000JBCP|5.0|I didn't know Mana' before listening to their MTV Unplugged CD.Mixing latin american music and pop and country rock has traditionally proved to  be quite difficult, but Mana' got it made!My favourite cut is &quot;Rayando  el sol&quot; (try to play it in your car.... on a sunny day of course) ,  but also all the other songs are absolutely super. This Cd is a &quot;must  have&quot; for anybody who  appreciates country rock and fine pop music and  is fascinated by lyrics in spanish.It's definitely going to be my summer  &quot;soundtrack&quot;.By the way, thanks to Amazon I already have other  Cds of Mana'which confirm their great talent.
B00003CWL5|5.0|The best movie I've seen since Silence of the Lambs(coincidently they both won WELL DESEREVED oscars).See it for Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning's wonderful preformances.Thora Birch's perfect timing and Alan Ball's superb  screenplay,completmented by Sam Mendes great direction
B000023X9W|5.0|Every now and then, when I'm  fed up with the pop music I usually listen to, I need to go back to oldies and goodies, unless an artist like Neil Young comes up with a new acoustic country rock CD.It's short (only about  39 minutes) compared to current standards, but almost as sweet and inspired  as his classic albums of the seventies such as &quot;Harvest&quot; and  &quot;After the gold rush&quot;. My favourite songs are &quot;The great  divide&quot;, &quot;Razor love&quot;, &quot;Good to see you&quot; and  &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, four country folk ballads that I won't forget.  One may not fully appreciate all melodies at first hearing, I had to play  this CD several  times before really enjoying it. In conclusion,one of my  favourite CDs for my summer holidays.
B000001FFJ|5.0|This album is, in the true sense of the word, awesome.<br />If you've never heard Tom Waits, you're in for a serious shock.  I guarantee that you have never heard music like this.<br />Although many people try to describe this  album, and Waits in general, by referring to his gruff voice, his bizarre  instrumentation and percussion, and so on, I firmly believe that the  difference between this album and typical, everyday music is indescribable.   You simply must hear it.
B000023X9W|5.0|Every now and then, when I'm  fed up with the pop music I usually listen to, I need to go back to oldies and goodies, unless an artist like Neil Young comes up with a new acoustic country rock CD.It's short (only about  39 minutes) compared to current standards, but almost as sweet and inspired  as his classic albums of the seventies such as &quot;Harvest&quot; and  &quot;After the gold rush&quot;. My favourite songs are &quot;The great  divide&quot;, &quot;Razor love&quot;, &quot;Good to see you&quot; and  &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, four country folk ballads that I won't forget.  One may not fully appreciate all melodies at first hearing, I had to play  this CD several  times before really enjoying it. In conclusion,one of my  favourite CDs for my summer holidays.
B000002GQG|5.0|Whoa, How old was I when I went to a Moody Blues concert?  Never mind.... One good thing is they're as old as I am. I have all their albums but when I listened to this one, their spirit is in every song. You don't just  listen to the Moody Blues, you have to hear their lyrics which convey a  feeling of calm and peace.  It's a shame these guys were not as well known  as the Rolling Stones or the Beatles because, frankly, as far as music is  concerned, they are masters.
B000003EUL|5.0|For a long time, I was never quite satisfied with recordings of the second Brahms, but this one left me stunned. His exceptional pianism aside, his feeling for tone and rhythmic accuracy make for what sounds like a new  work. I urge all to obtain this wonderful CD; the Beethoven is also worthy  of similar praise.
0783240503|5.0|I loved this film!  It is entertaining on so many levels that I have enjoyed watching it many times.<br />Although I did not have an opportunity to see this on stage and I would now jump at the opportunity to do so as long  as Donny Osmond was playing Joseph.  I think he does an excellent job  conveying the happy go lucky Joseph before his brothers attempt to seal his  fate.  While I wasn't a Donny fan before but I do remember the Puppy Love  stage, I am now - he is a blend of fun naivite' and sexy power broker in  Pharoah's government.  My daughter's think his is really a hottie - the  second generation of Donny fans.  I bought this tape right after I had  rented it because it is so very much fun to watch and all comparisons to  the stage production are ill conceived.  You will be slighting yourself if  you don't immediately buy this tape - buy it because after you rent it, you  will want to own it.  This movie is great family entertainment and I can  honestly say that many movies being produced recently are not.  Treat  yourself - you deserve it.
B000002IST|5.0|This is a great mix of music! It has everything, from the light-hearted &quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot; to the heart-wrenching &quot;No Son of Mine.&quot; Genesis has out-done themselves with this one. It's perfect. I  would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Phil Collins or of Genesis.
B000002UB3|5.0|I am a devoted Beatles fan - so be aware of my own personal bias in the following review.<br />Abbey Road is not the greatest album by the Beatles (I would rate it behind &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; &quot;Revolver,&quot;  &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; the &quot;White Album,&quot; and maybe even  &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; in that order), but it is nonetheless a  masterful achievement. Harrison's two compositions are brilliant, and  Lennon's songs are innovative and dynamic. McCartney's contributions are  solid, but not among his best songwriting. The only flaw on this album  stems from the Beatles decision to reject George's &quot;All Things Must  Pass,&quot;  - a song that George had wanted to include and that the group  did rehearse before dropping it - and the decision to include  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer,&quot; which while it is an enjoyable novelty  song, is the great album's only low point. Nonetheless, this is one of the  20 best albums ever recorded by anyone, and I still contend that it is  *essential* to anyone's music library.<br />By the way - don't be deceived by  blow-hard blue meanies who claim, either implicitly or explicitly, that if  you like the Stones you can't like the Beatles and vice versa. Anyone who  is a careful and intelligent student of music can appreciate the  extraordinary accomplishments of BOTH groups. As a long time fan of rock  music, I lean heavily toward the Beatles as the better of the two legendary  groups. I regard the Beatles as not only the greatest rock and pop band of  all time (and I emphasize BOTH rock AND pop), but one of the 20th century's  most artistically creative forces. Still, I rank the Stones as one of the  three greatest bands of all time (with The Beatles and The Who), and I  enjoy &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; as much as &quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  So, go out and by both albums, play them a lot, and appreciate the equally  marvellous contributions of two phenomenal bands. <br />Peace and love to all.  Beatles Forever. Lennon Lives!
B00000J7J4|2.0|I was looking forward to an alternative/rock album. Instead what I got was a latin/rap album with a couple of rock songs (which are the ones I had heard on the radio). A great tactical move by Santana, but a major  disappointment for me!
0780622650|1.0|A trivia question.  What movie knocked Titanic from it's record number of weeks at No. 1 at the box office?  Lost In Space.  Which is particularly amazing since it is one of the worst movies and waste of talent and  celluloid every to (dis)grace a cineplex near you.  While light years more  sophisticated in terms of special effects than the original TV series on  which the movie is based, it is a movie that is as convoluted and  pathetically contrived as any in recent memory. While all movies require  some degree of suspension of disbelief, this movie does not even have a  reasonably coherent story line.  And to have the talents of William Hurt,  Mimi Rogers, Gary Oldman, and Heather Graham all combine into this mess of  a movie is absolutely mind-boggling.  This movie is constructed of every  cliche imaginable.  Characters are introduced in completely implausible  ways just to have another character to market as an action figure.  The  movie ends with the possibility of sequels...let's hope those plans are  Lost In Space.
B00003XACV|5.0|Beautiful. This is the best soundtrack I have ever bought. I just recieved it today and have listened to it 4 times. If you've seen the movie, you'll really enjoy this.
B000006OAM|5.0|Once again, Natalie Merchant has proved that she is one of the most talented and emotionally driven artists living today. I cannot even begin to describe the haunting melodies of the songs on this album. Just go buy  it and you'll see that songs like &quot;King of May&quot; and &quot;Life is  Sweet&quot; really deserve to be heard by everyone in the world.
0425129586|5.0|I picked this book from a list of Books for a 9th grade english assignment.  Iam now in the 10th grade and I loved the book. It leaves you guessing and wondering who the killer was!  I absolutey HATE to read, and I  sat and read this whole book in one day. If this book shows up on a list to  rea..it is a must pick.  it is even good enough just go out and buy!
0440133688|4.0|I have read this book three times: When I was a first year medical student I found it to be exaggerated. When I was in my intern year I found it to be an understatement. Reading it for the third time in the middle of my  residency allowed me to have a more mature perspective of this book. I find  it to have a striking resemblence to another classic: &quot;Catch 22&quot;  by Joseph Heller. I will start by saying that both books are NOT great  literature masterpieces . They do not stand in one line with Joyce, Amos  Oz, Steinback or Hemmingway and as a work of art they therefore deserve ,  in my opoinion 2 or 3 stars of rating.They do share, however, a unique  quality which is this: They both manage to capture in an astonishing  accurracy, through sarcasm and absurd, all that is twisted, wrong and cruel  in the systems they deal with. Being both a doctor and an IDF officer, I  can testify  from personal experience that both the military and the  medical field have a lot in common , mainly that they both are a  stressfull, wearing enviroments. Shem's accurate perception lead this book  to being the sharpest description of this enviroment so far, just as  &quot;Catch 22&quot; was in its times I therefore share the enthusiasm of  the majority of the reviewers of this book, as much as  I can identify with  the ones who found it disappointing in the literary sense. It therfore gets  a rating of 4.
B00004T9UF|5.0|i bought this cd the first week it came out and it is now one of my favorites.this cd does have one bad song on it. it's called &quot;remember me&quot; and it's track n0.9(dont waste your time listening to it
B0000024TQ|5.0|I have this album on the old 33 1/3 and love all the tracks. The best track is the second track &quot;Save The Life Of My Child&quot; the music for that is just great. and the feelings that I get from listoning to the  song makes me crie. It has some of Simon and Garfunkels' Greatest songs  such as &quot;AMERICA&quot; &quot;OLD FRIENDS&quot; and &quot;MRS.  ROBINSON&quot;. anyone who has ever heard Simon and Garfunkel should buy  this. It needs 1000 stars!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Seeing as Radiohead are touring and gearing up for a new album release, I went back to this masterpiece, and I was astonished to still be finding new sonic details that I hadn't got before. The fact that this seems to have happened to me on virtually every listen is a testament to the sheer  musical ability of Radiohead. 'Airbag' is the albums opener and reference  point from which it hinges around. Full of strange but utterly compelling  chord changes, and a solitary cello, the closest relative this ahs in the  music world is DJ Shadow. Other standout tracks include 'Paranoid Android'  Radiohead's epic, 'Karma Police', an intoxicating and jazzy piano-led track  and 'No Surprises', oxymoronic in it's sarcastically happy refrain and  despairing lyrics. But every track is brilliant, and all hit upon entirely  different genres, both within and outside rock music. The lyrics are also  genius, as proved by the masterful roleplay of 'Climbing Up The Walls', in  which Thom imagines he is a serial killer. If you have ever felt that  something isn't right in this world, then this album will explain that  single feeling to you and keep telling it to you for it's duration. This is  a masterpiece which I urge you to buy without hesitation. It will be  remembered in the future as a pinnacle of the 90's....
0375703764|3.0|It is just too bad. I really wish that I could say more good things about this book, because I really liked it when I started it, but as I got further and further into it- it lost my interest. The idea is a great one,  and the style is a fun for a while (especially the use of different page  lay outs) but the endless footnotes lead nowhere. Perhaps that is the  point, especially when considering the idea of the novel- but still there  just wasn't much in them except to show off how many authors and book  titles one person can  come up with.  So....I can't tell if I really want  to recomend this book or not. It began so promising and original but by the  end it was boring and uninventive. At least that was how I felt. I rather  wish that I had spent the time reading something else now that I look back  on it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Ok - i'm going to hold back on saying over and over again that this is the best movie to come out of the '90s and will have a cult following the likes clockerwork orange has only seen - and take this chance to comment on the  fact that this DVD is on 2 discs one full of features - this is the first  DVD i got to use my angle button (even though the second angle was behind  the scenes shots) i love the fact that i have all my little DVD's and the  thins big honkin fight club cd on top.
B00003CWL5|2.0|this is one of the most OVERRATED FILMS EVER.TRUE Kevin Spacey did a Good Job but not Enough To Rewarded over DEnzel Washington.I have seen this Movie Before it was Called THe World According To Garp.Annette Bening was  SOlid as well.this film reminded me of Jerry Springer as well.with alot of  Twists&amp;Turns.it has alot of Cliches all over it.the Direction was  Good.People are Dysfunctional No Matter what their Status is in Life  Period.that's Nothing New.this FIlm didn't break any New Ground in any  way.SOme Good Performances but Way Overrated&amp;Predictable in alot of  Spots.COmpared Too Garp this is Tame.RObin WIlliams was One Step Above  Kevin Spacey&amp;He did His Film Nearly 20 Years Back.this is just a  Shrewed REMAKE.
B00001U0GQ|4.0|this is what movie making is all about. this movie is my favorite of all time. beautiful scenery,romantic under tones and just enough adventure for any one . ddl is a gem, along with eric schweig, and madeline stowe, i LOVE  THIS MOVIE!
B00004T9UF|4.0|If you're looking for 18 doses of &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, you're bound to be a little disappointed by this album. There are many funny moments on the Marshall Mathers LP to be sure. In particular, the Ken  Kaniff skit has me rolling every time. But compared to the Slim Shady disc,  this album is much angrier, and most of the songs lack the immediate hooks  of his debut. <br /><br />Give it some time though, and this album will grow on  you. Songs like &quot;Stan&quot;, in which Eminem assumes the persona of a  deranged fan, show he is maturing, if ever so slightly. He also sports a  dead-on, hilarious mocking of LFO in &quot;Marhsall Mathers&quot;. You  might hate Eminem with all your guts, but you cannot deny that he is a  supremely talented and funny lyricist.
B000002LND|3.0|Obviously after ten years it's time for another Madonna hits collection. But &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; is still a worthwhile primer for the casual Madonna or 80's pop fan. &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Like a  Virgin&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Crazy for You&quot; are now  rightfully considered classics. However, there are some songs missing  (&quot;Who's That Girl&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot; chief among them) as  well as some curious edits (what the hell happened to the middle of  &quot;Into the Groove&quot;?). This album is worthwhile for the casual  Madonna fan, or as a collection-starter. Someone who is more of a Madonna  fan, though, would be better served by getting the full, original versions  of some of these songs on the original albums.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Galaxy Quest is absolutely hilarious.  If you know anything about fandom or have been to a con, this movie is highly reccommended.
B0000025F7|5.0|as i write this,i am on my 7th copy (3 vinyl, 3tape, 2cd) of this album, which should begin to tell you how good this album is. rightfully considered better than &quot;thriller&quot; by many mj fans, this is quite  possibly the best dance/pop album ever recorded. there is no way you can  not move to &quot;dont stop til you get enough&quot;, &quot;workin day and  night&quot; or &quot;off the wall&quot;. &quot;rock with you&quot; and  &quot;i can't help it&quot; are michael's two best vocal performances ever,  and &quot;she's out of my life&quot; was one of mj's last great ballads  (before he decided he wanted to become the black barbra streisand). my only  gripe:why'd ya change the cover, mike? can someone at sony please persuade  the guy to put his (original) face back on the cover? also, i think it's  time for a re-mastering job...all in all, though, an album that you can't  miss with.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Well, after a few listenings this album is simply AWESOME!  Don't expect to find some good heavy riffs and songs reminding you of Kyuss (former band of Josh Homme), this is simply a great alternative/modern rock album.   Every song is unique. It goes from good modern rock with &quot;feel good  hit of the summer&quot;, to good alternative with &quot;the lost art of  keeping a secret&quot;, to punk with &quot;quick and to the  pointless&quot;, to great melodies with &quot;auto pilot&quot; and &quot;in  the fade&quot;.  <br />If you like some great rock music in the style of Pearl  Jam, this album is for you.  It is a great album that needs a few  listenings to appreciate, due to it's richness in sound and  melodies.<br />Kyuss fans, this may be not the album that you expected from  Queens of the Stone Age but it's still a great album in its own  kind.<br />Pearl Jam fans, if you want to discover a great band, this album is  for you, listen to it and you won't be disappointed.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The wife and I sneaked into this movie and we missed the crucial first 10 minutes or so.  She wanted to barf (due to the raw violence) but stuck it out.  Even though she didn't like it she stayed because there was something about it that drew her in.  She won't say what it was but it was enough to  get her to sit there through the Fight Club's entirety.  For sure the gore  must have over-shadowed everything for her.<br />I, on the other hand, loved  Fight Club so much I went out and bought the book.  The book disappointed  me and gets a 2-star rating.  So kudos to the screen adaptation...very  talented job in re-writing and adapting the book to movie script!  This was  a clearly under-rated film mired by the shadow casted by the Columbine High  School shooting.<br />I love the social commentary and how true and well it  fits into today's society.  Fight Club is an excellent dark comedy with the  message to fight the power that the media has on our psyche. The fight  scenes are brutal but appropriate for the film's message that we have all  become too soft and disconnected.  ...who  thinks that the brutal fight scenes and chaos in the movie was used to  glorify violence and promote anarchy and social unrest.  To quote Ed  Norton, when interviewed about the movie's violence and message and how it  might promote events like Columbine High shooting in real life he simply  said: &quot;I think that is just lazy journalism.&quot;  I can't agree  more.<br />In my opinion, the gory violence goes to extreme to show how  ridiculous brutal violence is.  The violence was not used to hurt other  people who were innocent by-standers.  It was only inflicted upon men who  wanted the violence to make them feel alive.  So the message is not to go  out there and do harm unto our countrymen but to break out of the mold and  free our selves from the grasp that the consumer society has on us.<br />The  message is we are getting too soft as our lust for material goods dominate  our lives.We prostitute ourselves for that great job so we can get a loan  to buy all the great and expensive things we must have because the  marketing people tell us so.  Also, we have become too detached from our  true selves and from nature.  We can no longer live simply or simply live.   We measure our success, and others' success, by the ability to accumulate  money and goods money can buy.  Our idea of re-connecting to nature is  taking our gas guzzling SUV out for a ride at the local/state/national park  or worse, our daily commute on our well paved streets and highways!<br />Fight  Club's message is we need to get back to nature and live simply.  Do the  tough and challenging things that make us feel alive.  Setting up fight  clubs to beat ourselves silly  is one example but there are other ways.  If  we need to ask what those ways are then the movie is correct in its  assessment of how far removed we are from our true and simple selves.  We  survived for thousands of year without SUVs, BMWs, the latest bikes and  bike gears, the Versace dress shirt, that beautiful dress or those high  heel shoes.  I can go on but let's get back to the movie...=)<br />The fight  scenes were not made for the audience to enjoy but squirm because of their  extreme.  If you really enjoy the fight scenes check in with your favorite  local therapist.  As for me, the closest I get to this primordial  celebration of manhood is taking up Kardio Kickboxing at the local gym to  lose weight.<br />The director is very dead-on and the actors were superb.   Norton is very talented and Fight Club should have been to him what  American Beauty was to Kevin Spacey.  At this pace Norton should be  nominated if not awarded an Oscar very soon.  Norton's role in this film  makes his work in Primal Fear looks pale in comparison.  <br />Pitt shows  maturity  and range in this film...he has been doing a lot of great works  via Twelve Monkeys, the Seven Signs(?) and such off-the-beaten-path movies.   Overalla Fight Club is a great film and will probably become a  classic.<br />I deducted one star for the ending.  I thought it could have  been handled better.  With all the special features in the DVD it is  definitely a collectible item.

0441172717|5.0|Duke Leto Atreides takes control of the desert planet Arrakis when given to him by the Galactic Emperor as a fief.  The planet is the galaxy's source of the narcotic spice melange, and the planet's importance is  therefore critical.  The previous rulers of Arrakis, the Harkonnens,  however, refuse to surrender the planet peacefully.<br />The Duke's 15-year  old son, Paul Atreides, has been prepared all his life for the burden of  command.  Unknown to him, though, he represents the culmination of  generations of genetic and religious manipulation.  When the Harkonnens  attempt to reclaim the planet from his father, he must join the native  population and fulfill his destiny as their messianic leader to free them  from the Harkonnen's brutal regime.<br />Though written over 35 years ago,  Dune is still considered one of the two or three best science fiction  novels ever written, and is de rigeur for all science fiction readers.  The  characters are both vivid and epic, and the descriptions are lush and rich  without being baroque.  Though some have difficulty with the jargon  (sprinkled throughout the book), most feel that it gives an air of  authenticity to the text.  There is also an extensive glossary in the  appendices.<br />Though later novels in this series are not as strong as Dune,  Herbert's world nonetheless leaves the reader hungry for subsequent  installments in the plotline.<br />No reader's library should be without a  copy of Dune.
B00000K19E|5.0|When I left the cinema after seeing THE MATRIX I noticed that people left the building as If they had witnessed something truly religious. Very seldom do we see something at the movies that can change the look u have on  the reality. Or the feeling that u have witnessed something new and truly  remarkable. THE MATRIX is of couse such a film and I think I speak for a  looooooooooooooooot of people that I am thankful for that it was made.  Notable filmcritic Pauline Kael once said:<br />&quot;Movies are so rarely  great, that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason  to be interested in them.....&quot;<br />THE MATRIX is not one of those  events.
6300214753|5.0|I am normally a fan of drama when it comes to movies, so I wasn't expecting much from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  Fifteen minutes into the movie, however, I started laughing very hard, and did not stop till the  movie's hilairious ending.  The humor in this movie is always fresh and  witty, and Matthew Broderick delivers laughs with absolute perfection.  This film classic is a constant reminder to us all, that sometimes we just  need a &quot;day off.&quot;
B000002A3T|5.0|I have been very much into Pink Floyd for a while now and I must say that while Waters was good ( Noone can say The Wall isnt one of the best Rock and roll albums ever made) Pink Floyd has seemed to take a turn for the  better when Waters left. Momentary lapse of reason is a good Album in my  opinion, Learning to Fly along with a few other tracks such as On the  Turning Away stand out as really well written and orchestrated pieces. But  Division Bell is the Cream on the cake for the New Pink Floyd band. All the  tracks on this Album ( With the exception of Speak To Me, those backup  singers just get on my nerves)are good, but the best of all is the last  track, High Hopes which is my Favorite song , of Pink Floyd and other  groups. The mental immagery and word and sound choices all mix together to  give you a sense of the past and makes you relate to it. Very Good piece.  Overall Gilmour does a good job in leading the Band through this album. It  would be my hope that Pink Floyd will come out with another New Album but I  am not so sure that they will. If your young and found Pink Floyd  Attractive, definatly get Division Bell. Of all the Floyd Albums Division  Bells seems to sound a little more at home with the 80's and 90's  generation which may be a reason I like it. Dont get me wrong, the old  stuff is exellent too, but this Album was released in my time and i suppose  that gives it a different feel to it than the blasts from the Past. Think  about it, im outa here.
B000006TRV|5.0|I love this album. It took me a while to recognise how good it was, as at first the music seemed unsubstantial but after several times through I realised how good it is. Every song is great and although the order  fluctuates in relation to style, this is one of my favourite albums. It has  all the classic songs ie. &quot;Comfortably numb&quot;, &quot;Run like  Hell&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Goodbye blue sky&quot; but also  there are some great songs that the other reviews didn't mention like  &quot;Is there anybody out there?&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the  worms&quot;. Also watching the film is well worth it as it provides good  visual explanation and explains the seemingly prejudiced lyrics. The work  in &quot;The Wall&quot; is brilliant, especially the underlying music  beneath Gilmour's guitar, I really love the drumming in &quot;Waiting for  the Worms&quot;. &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot;  are definetly two must have albums in any music collection.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Only 'wow!' could i say after i listened to Britney's new album. I just find it even better than 'BABY ONE MORE TIME...',which I though was impossible! The album is full of pop tunes which are really catchy (despite  some of them sound just like the same); but it has also got a little feel  of r&amp;b, which makes it excellent. Britney's voice appears far more  trained than in her debut album, which is great. The outstanding tracks are  for sure: 'OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN', 'STRONGER','(WHAT U SEE) IS WHAT U  GET','WHERE ARE YOU NOW?' and 'CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME'. Most of the  up-tempo songs are really well produced, and you can recognize Mutt Lange's  touch on 'DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW', it just sounds so much as a  Shania Twain song!  To summarize I'll say this album is a must have, it's  the bomb, I've seen really a few like this,. They don't mek'em like this  anymore! (but Britney does of course!)- This album POPS!  -BRITNEY I LOVE  YOU!-
630575067X|1.0|This was truly bad.  Unlike the early Star Wars, where the various characters provided background information, the special effects (which were really good) seem designed to make a coherent story line superfluous.  Liam  Neeson was the biggest disappointment for me.  He wasn't acting, he was  just letting the Force handle it for him.  I hope the next two (promised?)  Star Wars are better, but I won't hold my breath.  Since (and counting)  Return of the Jedi, they seem like an expensive advertisement for some new  doll, game or accessory.
B000002U82|5.0|&quot;Dark Side&quot; is one of those rare albums that has to be listened to from start to finish and never played on 'random'.  Not because there are few breaks in between songs but rather, because there is a story being  told of greed, desperation, depression, and insanity.  Each song can (and,  on the radio, does) stand on its own, but in order to capture the true  magic of the album, it should be played in its entirety in one sitting.   Chances are you'll just hit play over and over again.
B00001U0GQ|1.0|The director's cut very well may have added a few superflous scenes to add length, but it also removes parts of the movie.  I liked the original movie a great deal, which is why I bought the disc.  I particularly liked the  ending, but the ending of the director's cut has a different soundtrack and  was mixed and cut differently.  Some shots seem to have literally stretched  the original version to make it last longer.  I am not talking about slow  motion, I am talking about literally pausing the shot for a fraction of a  second, going to the next shot, pausing it again, etc...  Some of the  dramatic lines in the movie were removed, to the point where the scene no  longer makes sense.  Some of the fight sequence at the end also appeared to  have been edited out.  Without viewing one edition at the same time as the  other, I can't be sure of how much is missing.  Yet while watching the  director's cut, I kept noticing missing pieces and awkward additions.  This  edition is considerably less than the original, and don't expect it to be  just as good.
0440219078|5.0|&quot;The Giver&quot; makes a great addition to the already growing dystopia library. Many of you may be wondering what Negative Utopia and Dystopia are- no, they aren't commonly used terms, are they? Well, let's start early on...<br />Many readers may have heard of books like  &quot;1984&quot; (by George Orwell) and &quot;Brave New World&quot; (by  Aldous Huxley). These great novels are perfect examples of modern  dystopias. Dystopias, or Negative Utopias, as they are also known, are the  opposite of a Utopia, or perfect society (making these words describe  greatly flawed and problematic societies). The use of Negative Utopias  usually revolves around human rights- in &quot;1984&quot;, human rights are  taken away, and &quot;big brother&quot; is always watching. In &quot;Brave  New World&quot;, the use of post-modern science is used to illustrate a  dark world of the future, where people are genetically engineered and  separated into classes. This type of writing is sometimes simply called  paranoid, but I thoroughly believe that the warnings expressed in some of  these books are important to consider- while I doubt that thought-police  are going to take over our country tomorrow, sometimes our society seems to  be heading that way.<br />&quot;The Giver&quot; uses many of the same ideas  (classes, regulated societies) to illustrate another dark world of the  future, where marriages are formed by the government, and all children are  adopted. It adds its own flavorful twist, though- a man called &quot;the  Giver&quot; is designated to hold all of the dark thoughts that the rest of  society has forgotten, memories that are passed on from generation to  generation. This addition is very ingenious, and makes the entire plot a  little more eerie. The book also succeeds in suspense- I couldn't stop  reading until I got to the end.<br />I was debating between 4 and 5 stars on  this book, but in the end I decided on 5 stars. While there are some things  that could have been developed or added, the book succeeds in doing the job  it was meant to do: introducing the entire idea of Dystopias, or futuristic  but flawed worlds, to students and young people.
1572522232|5.0|Argento was once dubbed &quot;the Verdi of Violence&quot;, and with good reason.  SUSPIRIA is perhaps the most operatic horror film ever made (that is, if one doesn't consider Visconti's THE DAMNED a horror film), with  great, garish colors, baroque settings, high-pitched music, and incredibly  bloody death scenes.<br />Argento dispenses with logic early on, and if you're  looking for linear plot, go elsewhere.  This is a nightmare vision captured  on celluoid, worthy of Bosch and Dante, and not for the faint-hearted.  But  if you've got a stomach for it, it's a hell of a movie and an unforgettable  experience.
B00003CX5A|4.0|In this wonderful new film adaption of the classic story, Tim Burton continues his eerie but tasteful career in the strange. Sleepy Hollow continues his tradition of creepy, slightly offbeat movies full of suspense  and fear.<br />The story in this movie itself flows along at a nice pace,  never slowing down too much, and includes many twists along the way. The  mood set by the movie is dark and moody, but it never becomes too moody to  enjoy. Johnny Depp, who plays Ichabod Crane, does a great job playing his  part- his character is professional, though often ends up looking funny  (including the many times he gets blood spurted in his face). Christina  Ricci does a good job playing a common townsgirl who is also slightly  suspicious seeming.<br />One of the things that makes this movie so appealing  is the new special effects that add to this already strong movie. They  enhance the visual experience, making this a good scary (but not too scary)  movie to see.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I would rather support a group of artists that attempt to be different with each release than a band that rides a wave of repeated mediocrity.  If Pearl Jam hits and misses on their new album, it's not because they can't  write great songs anymore (rival, insignificance, and breakerfall prove  that wrong), it's that they refuse to do the same thing twice, for better  or for worse.  Listen to this record over and over again and you will start  to see just how MUSICAL Pear Jam has become.  No longer young upstarts,  these artists have become thoughtful, intelligent, experienced songwriters  that know exactly what they're doing even if it may sound unorthodox.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Amidst words from critics that Britney Spears is just a pop star for young girls and pre-teen/teen girls and boys, Britney Spears releases this new album, supposedly showing a more talented, more mature side of her.<br />Yeah, right.<br />The truth about this CD is that it continues the already overrated  legacy of Britney Spears, one that lost all emotion and talent before it  began. The fact is, if you really listen to the title track from Britney's  first CD (...Baby One More Time) and the title track from this new release,  they are very similar. The only reason that &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot;  became a sensation (a boring one, at that) is that it follows the same  formula as the title track from her first CD. The rest of the songs, though  not quite as amateur as the ones on the first album, are mostly the same,  just slightly altered so that most people accept it as new.<br />And, if you  are saying (like many fans are) &quot;Hey, she's still young. She was only  16 or 17 when she had the number one song in the country- give her a  break.&quot; Well, there's one major flaw in that concept: she didn't  produce that song, or any others. Many of her songs are obviously rip-offs  of other artists, and those that aren't are just produced by the record  companies to be &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;now&quot;, though most of them  end up being predicable and boring. Britney probably doesn't write much, if  any, of her other music- for sure, she can't play an instrument or produce  any other part of her pieces. She is simply the result of a talent agency  search that worked too well. In the long run she is just another fad, one  that will die out like all of the other musical fads we've had in this  country. There are so many other music choices for youths these days,  there's no reason to listen to Britney Spears- if you do, you're just  supporting the domination that these shallow teen-pop groups are putting on  the market.<br />Oh, and finally, on a side-note, I noticed Britney Spears'  review (pretty short, actually) near the top of the page. It was  interesting... for one, she spelled &quot;interested&quot; (or should we  say intrested) wrong... a disappointment even from Britney. I say, if  &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; is a gift from her heart to my ears, I'll  keep the receipt and return it.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|Disney's Mulan is one of the most subtle pieces of work to come out of the Disney studios in years.  There is a quiet charm to this film that makes it quite enjoyable to watch again and again.  There is of course the required  sidekicks (Eddie Murphy as a very not chinese Dragon, MusShu) and the  heroine's pining balad (&quot;Reflection&quot; who's single version  performed by Christina Aguilera was mercifully absent from radio rotation).   But for some reason Mulan doesn't seem as desperate to impress or  entertain as the more recent Disney animated features seem to be.  Produced  almost entirely by Disney's Florida unit, Mulan is a refreshing departure  from what we're used to from the Mouse House, and a welcomed one at that.   The DVD contains no bonus material.
6305718954|5.0|Stigmata is by far one of the best movies I've seen- it is really incredible in comparison with other movies that try to achieve its success.<br />This movie is strange, and sometimes even slightly sinister in  its portrayal of a woman named Frankie Paige in New York (Patricia  Arquette) who is afflicted with the Stigmata, or the wounds of Christ. An  open minded priest (Gabriel Byrne) ends up meeting with her, and is  extremely surprised to find that this claim of Stigmata occurences is true,  despite the fact that Frankie doesn't go to church. In fact, Frankie isn't  very religious at all, and lives the shallow, hip life of a partying  hairstylist. The contrast between the Church and the life of this young  woman is brilliant and stunningly effective.<br />The rest of the movie is  spent discovering more about the situation that Frankie is in, and the  possible implications it could have to the church, and to the religion  itself. In the end this movie is a deeply thought provoking exploration of  religion itself, how everything that is accepted by the church may not be  the truth, and how what many of us follow could be completely backwards. It  really makes you think.<br />This already strong movie is further enhanced  with the visual effects- so much so that you could buy this movie just for  the incredible scenes. All of the wounds of Christ shown in the film are  very realistically, enough so that many squeamish people may have to turn  away from the screen during these moments. The the way the wounds are shown  to occur (chaotically, and in sudden flashses) is incredible, adding to the  suspense. Also, in the climax of the film there is one particularly  rewarding scene which you might just have to watch over and over (it's too  cool!)<br />This movie is definitely and incredible achievment in filmaking,  with a great and intellectual plot expressed with beauty. Some people may  not like it as much if they are sensitive to graphic scenes, or if they  don't like content that has to do with religion. However, for the majority  of people who see it, this movie is a greatly rewarding and enjoyable  experience.
B00001QEE8|4.0|Yet another in Disney's self proclaimed Masterpiece editions, The Jungle Book is a lot of fun but not one of Disney's best.  Watch this video for some great songs and wonderful characters but please excuse the flimsy  story which is all but cancelled out in the film's final scene.  Still, the  movement captured by the Disney animators, especially in the case of  Bagheera, is a marvel to watch.  With all these great characters (Baloo,  Shere Kahn, King Louie wonderfully voiced by Louis Prima) and memorable  songs (The Bear Neccesities) it's unfortunate that the story couldn't also  have been worthwhile.  Still, no one will resist adding this to their  clam-shell collection before it's gone...for now at least.
B00003OSSL|1.0|Next to the bomb Wild Wild West with Wil Smith, I came so close to turning this movie off and burning the DVD - then I remembered I rented it - The complete dulling pace of this movie, and the inability for the characters  to communicate drove us nuts.  It was like a bad episode of NYPD Blue where  people go sentances without speaking words -- The movie just dragged, and  the characters left you feeling like this could never happen -- was this of  the fantasy genre?   Don't waste your money.
B000000FG8|5.0|Operation Ivy is the stepping stone of many great punk/ska bands that came shortly after.  They are Rancid before  Rancid, but unique in the same way.  They are history.  They still have the rancid type style of making  every  song into a pleasant and unique melody that one well recognize after only  hearing it once.  I gaurantee that you will listen to this album straight  thorugh because it never gets old.  Especially if you love rancid.  But,  were in the hell did the lead singer, Jessie, go to?  I heard he is a  butcher now.  Anyway, you got my approval and you better listen to me  because I have a welding degree.  Hi Tom.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Ask the critics &quot;What's the greatest movie ever made?&quot; and you'll probably get the same old tired response &quot;Citizen Kane, of course!&quot;. Ask any true movie fan and there is no question &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. This is the movie that has never been equaled for  disturbing psychological imagery.  This is the movie that made Kentucky  Fried Chicken something to flap your wings about.  Who can ever forget  Grannie as she tossed her salad with cigarette ashes? This is THE greatest  movie of all time.<br />Too bad I wore out my only copy...
B00004RITP|2.0|After having listened to now 6 renditions of Mahler's 10th, I have eventually become convinced that Deryck Cooke did an admirable thing in expanding and extrapolating on Mahler's only completed first movement and  skeleton of the other 4 remaining movements in this 10th symphony.<br />I  think Rattle's previous outing on EMI with the Bournemouth is a better  interpretation of the 10th.  I found this most recent recording to possess  the following problems: (1) it seemed so much quieter than the previous  recording, I had to turn my volume control up all the way until I could  hear anything; (2) the most dramatic moments in the symphony such as the  ending of the 1st movement is played softer and smoother and loses the  emotional and spiritual power it had on the earlier rendition, and (3) the  opening of the last movement is played so pianissimo and slowly it does not  even convey any quality at all except that of losing consciousness and  falling asleep.<br />Rattle should try to find and listen to an out of print  CD recording on Virgin by Karl Anton Rickenbacker with the Bamberger  Symphony performing symphonic fragments of Mahler.  The 3rd and last track  includes the most gorgeous and beautifully played performance of the 1st  movement from the 10th I have ever heard.  Rickenbacker proves that you can  play this movement very slowly, loud enough to hear, beautifully phrased,  and emotionally powerful.  It comes in at an unbelievably expansive 32  minutes and avoids deliberateness and achieves spiritual ecstasy.  Now  that's a recording I'd like to see Virgin reissue.  In fact, my biggest  dream is that Virgin would ask Rickenbacker and the Bamberger to do the  whole 10th in all its breathed-out glory.<br />I think EMI took a 2nd crack at  the 10th with Rattle because some reviews of the earlier try said that the  recording utilizing Grundig technology presented some problems.  After  listening to that recording several times, I cannot agree.  Even though  this2nd recording may be slightly improved in string ensemble quality and  a very nice and quiet live performance, it loses in energy and emotional  power what the 1st try had.  It was a VERY GOOD recording and I'm holding  on to it and think Rattle did a great job the first time around.  Bravo!  This second one, however, I just cannot recommend.<br />Mahler was said to  have changed his mind on his death bed when he asked his wife not to  destroy his manuscript of his 10th symphony.  He intended that someone  might attempt to &quot;do something with it&quot; and Alban Berg and Ernst  Krenek both took a whack at it.  Deryck Cooke seems to have gotten the  furthest.<br />After several hearings of a couple of versions and studying the  liner note history of the piece's spiritual journey, I appreciated Deryck  Cooke's disclaimer that his version was NOT a finished product, but a  performing version.  I have come to understand this subtitle to mean that  this is an orchestrational experiment to allow an audience to hear the  symphony in an elaborated form what it could possibly of sounded like if  Mahler had been allowed to compose a bit more of it.  This is fine, because  I find the form it is now in to almost maintain and hold sacred the mystery  of the closing bars of the 9th. Deryck Cooke emphasizes the eventual tone  of triumph at the end of the 5th and last movement and allows poignant  space for more meditation and contemplation of the piece.  The 10th  inevitably seems to be heading to the same unknown and mysterious regions  of the 9th.
0790732254|5.0|What a great comedy!  A friend recommended this movie to me, and I found myself laughing the whole way through! The back and forth bickering between the married couples is hilarious - and the scene in the diner is an  absolute classic. The gags just keep coming one after another. Mel Brooks  couldn't have done it any better. Although it drags in spots, I would  definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a comedy with a lot  of laughs. It's right up there with &quot;There's Something About  Mary&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot;. You'll love it!
B00004THAY|5.0|For many people this CD will seem like a dream come true.  For Eric Clapton and B.B. King, this CD probably represents the dream of two old friends finally realized.  Through out the CD, Clapton and King play off of  one another, each safe in the knowledge that neither has anything more to  prove except the joy in knowing that music can be made simply because it  exists.<br />It should come as no suprise that this CD is mostly a collection  of straight up blues:  the disk contains several B.B. standards - notably  &quot;Ten Long Years&quot; and &quot;Three O' Clock Blues&quot;, but the  songs are played in a way that makes them seem brand new.  An all acoustic  version of the classic &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; with its rambling  acoustic shuffle will be a real treat for lovers of acoustic blues, and the  heartfelt rendition of &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; makes for a nice  sentimental contrast to the funky R &amp; B styling of songs like  &quot;Marry Me&quot;.<br />Riding with Slowhand and the King - tunes to live  and drive by on a soul trip for the road with the top down and your hair  flying in the wind - buy it and drive!
0805062971|5.0|Having read the book first, I was very weary that this could actually be pulled off as a movie.  I was wrong.  The book itself is actually written in a very cinematic way.  It moves at a lightning fast pace, has a lot of  great dialogues, moves around a lot, and it has a lot of big,  theatrical-like events.  To say that the book is better than the movie is  not necessarily true.  They are both excellent in their own rights,  although the book comes off slightly more enjoyable in my opinion.  Either  way, my suggestion is to read the book AND see the movie, both several  times.
B00000JGHM|5.0|can you leave everything you have worked for in life at the drop of a hat when you feel the 'heat' coming at you?  that is the question that is asked in this movie.<br />robert deniro plays the leader of a group of robbers  in L.A.  deniro's character lives off his profession.  so dedicated, he is  very reluctant about having close bonds with others.  he has to be able to  leave them if he feels the 'heat'.<br />his crew is not the average 'rob the  local gas station' group of men.  these guys are professionals;  it's like  this is their 'job'.  they don't go after the cash in the armored car, they  go for the bonds... they don't go for the public's money in the bank, they  go for the bank's money.  these guys mean business.<br />al pacino plays the  cop that is going to take them down.  this is a man very dedicated to his  job. so dedicated, his marriage is falling apart and he is neglecting his  daughter.<br />eventually these two men meet in a diner, in which pacino and  deniro exchange words.  words about their dedication to their professions  and words that in order for one of them to go on, the other has to  stop.<br />heat is spectacular in every way.  it seems so epic, so grand.  lots of characters are introduced, L.A. never appeared more alluring,  different subplots; some solved, some not, and the most spectacular shoot  out ever caught on film in bright daylight.<br />heat is definetly a must see.  it has what most action movies lack, a story with characters you care  about.  everytime I see it, something new pops up.  and when it ends, I am  very happy to have been part of two men whose life seems so different, yet  are essentially the same.
0380788624|5.0|This is a fascinating read.  Well researched, and the characters are very human.  I made the mistake of starting this book when I was pregnant.  Once into the book I realized that it was not the funny, light hearted (albeit  stimulating) book that &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was.  I put the book down  thinking that I would read something less 'head heavy'.  After obsessing  over what I had read so far, I knew it was a lost cause.  I finished the  book two weeks before my baby was born.  Who knows, maybe he'll be a  mathmetician when he grows up!
B00000K2SC|4.0|This 1999 movie, the Matrix, would be in the top two of my favorite movies.  The special effects were great for example a time when Neo, the main character is shot by 5 bullets.  He sticks out a hand and the bullets  drop.  The actors and actresses were also great.  Its hard to imagine The  Matrix II will be better than the Matrix I. As a matter of fact its hard to  imagine any movie being better than this.  The main plot is about people in  a dream world of the truth while the people like us do not believe our  dreams are nothing but our thoughts.  You really start to believe in your  dreams like they our real.  This movie is given the &quot;R&quot; rating.   When you watch this movie you will think in should have been rated PG-13.   I truely believe it was right to have the R rating.  This is because the  movie is extremely hard to understand.  My 7 year old brother saw half of  this movie.  He loved the effects but did not understand the plot at all.   The ages for this movie I would say is mature 8 year olds and up.  If you  like science fiction see this motion picture.
052594527X|4.0|I enjoyed this unusual historical novel. The portrait &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; by the famous Dutch painter, Vermeer, apparently is considered &quot;the Dutch Mona Lisa&quot; because of the girl's enigmatic  look as she gazes at the painter.  This book tells a possible story  explaining the painting.  It revolves around a young maid who worked at the  painter's house, and who was enthralled with his work (and him). The story  takes place in the highly stratified and puritanical Dutch culture of the  mid 17th century. When I finished the book, I felt that I has just read a  beautiful fable.
0792101448|5.0|Everybody knows Sergio Leone's &quot;The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.&quot; Even if they only know how to humm parts of the theme music. Those who have seen it invariably rate it as something better that superb. &quot;Once Upon  A Time in the West&quot; postdates &quot;Good/Bad/Ugly&quot; and takes  everything that makes that film great and magnifies it until everything in  frame ceases to be even slightly realistic and becomes an sometimes almost  overloaded poem.<br />For my money this film easily surpasses  &quot;Good/Bad/Ugly&quot; on several levels. When Leone made this he was at  the height of his fame and power. This meant that he could do pretty much  as he liked.<br />Firstly, he filmed this western in the USA, his first. The  locations are nothing short of astonishing. Secondly he hired every big  name he could. Third, he indulged himself when it came to budget, sets and  production values. <br />Lastly, he found the biggest story he could, and told  it as big as he could, and thats *big.*<br />The shots are long. Some of them  seem to take hours. Sergio Leone takes joy in letting us watch water drip  onto a waiting badman's hat for what seems like several minutes. They are  brilliant, exciting minutes. This is a film to watch again and  again.<br />Stay away from any Pan and Scan version of this film. &quot;Once  Upon a Time in the West&quot; was filmed by a master craftsman in  magnificent 235:1  widescreen. This film is an epic and uses every square  inch of its frame to blow your mind. Panning and Scanning it is an insult  and a straight out ripoff.<br />Other people on this site have called this the  best western ever made. It is.<br />Wait for the DVD.
6304618344|5.0|Nicholas Cage and John Travolta put on some great performances in this  movie.  The great thing about this is movie is, both Travolta and Cage get  their shot at playing the good guy and the bad guy, In the SAME movie.  The  amazing thing is both actors give compelling performances in each role they  have in FACEOFF.  If you can get past the premise behind the movie  ....FACE-OFF..(Cage could never pass for Travolta or vice versa)then you  will love this movie!  Buy this one!!
B000002C1X|5.0|Ok, there's no saying it any other way, this CD is GREAT.  The best.  As for the review that top 5 most overhyped bands are those he listed, it is a sad day indeed if he believes so (putting Led Zeppelin and The Doors in the  list was the final insult).  Buy this one and enjoy it.
6302256615|5.0|Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and Gary Busey are the main actors in this movie and all of them are excellent in their roles.  This movie has it all, bank robberies, Car chases, Sky Diving, Fist fights, surfing and a little  bit of romance....you name it, its in there..and its fast paced.  This is  one of Keanu's best movies to date and one of my favorites.  I highly  recommend this movie!   It is excellent.
158234082X|4.0|....Most of the 31 reviews I just scanned are accurate whetherthey loved or hated the book.  <br />I am not a food professional but Iam a restaurant aficionado who apprenticed in NYC in the 60s and movedon. I also am a committed reader of creative non-fiction. Before I bought the book I was impressed by the author's appearance on Cooking Live Primetime (even though he trashtalks some of the Food Network personalities in the book he was a VERY good guest chef). And, also, by a piece in the New Yorker that is included with less editing in this book. <br />I like reading good writers write about food --- yes, even Orwell --- whether they like it or are raking mud. This guy has style as well as attitude, and he likes food. The fact that he recommends Howard Mitcham (look him up on amazon.com)is a big plus. BUT this is a messy book. The chapters are reasonably well organized but they were obviously written as separate pieces. The tone, style, taste, whatever you want to call it, varies quite a bit. Some chapters do not even use bad words. <br />My advice to a reader who likes foodtalk is to &quot;take what you need and leave the rest&quot; as Levon said a long time ago.  To those (like me) who would criticize A.B. as a memoirist for not tellng us ANYTHING about his parents, sibling(s?) or wife except that they exist: it takes thousands of pages of M.F.K. Fisher's works to learn enough to piece together a story of her life. Give the guy time (he already has enough rope) and another ZipDisk.
0060977264|5.0|I wept after I read this book the first time, and the second, and the third. It is not only a beautiful love story, but about finding a right path in life, and about believing.  Every time I read a good book, I mark  it, and but it in my quoting book - well - I think there was a quote on  every page I read.  And if the silly answer of what book I have read that  have changed my life would be - it must have been this book. I really  recommend it!  You will not be disappointed.
B00003CX9W|4.0|I recently saw the making of Fantasia 2000 on tv.  The conductor and the animators spoke of the methods used to integrate the animation with the music.  The level of difficulty they must have experienced with this  original release is mind boggling.  I remember sitting spellbound as a  child as the mythical creatures and disney characters danced across the  screen.  A truly breathtaking piece of cinematography and animation.
0440228921|5.0|Dear friends,<br />I know that you like reading books. We (9d) read this book (The Giver written by Lois Lowry) which deals with rules in a community seperated from the whole world. At the beginning it is hard to understand and you will expect that it is a boring book. But after this part there is  a turning - point in thrilling. After this point the story gets much more  interesting, although it is still confusing. While you are reading the  story lots of questions come to your mind. Some are answered later on but  other answers you can only assume.  All in all it is a very nice and  interesting book because the author presents the advantages and problems of  this perfect world seen through the community's eyes very well. That's why  I can recommend the book.
6305095574|4.0|This is a great movie for fans of blood and guts. But if you are looking for plot development, look elsewhere.  The plot is simple: 5 friends go into the woods and only 1 comes out alive.  Excellent make-up and blood  sequences mixed in with some humor make this an enjoyable film.
0440234743|4.0|This is the first Grisham book that was not handed to me by friends or family; I actually went out and bought this one.  And, it was worth every penny and more in terms of excitement, thrills, and plain old enjoyment.  I  could not put this book down; I even dragged it on a trip to France so that  I could read it in the morning and at night, and preferring it to some of  the sightseeing options in Paris.  On the flight back to the US, I was  amazed to find the traveller next to me reading the same book, with the  seemingly same level of intensity that I had.  Upon my return home, someone  I know actually ended up trying to recommend the book to me.(!)<br />The  ending, quite surprisingly after going through the action-packed adventures  of the rest of the book, was an adrenaline disappointment.  However, in as  much as I would not avoid an investment because it returned  &quot;only&quot; 19% instead of 20%, I wouldn't recommend avoiding this  book simply because &quot;only&quot; 95% of it is engrossing.
B00004T9UJ|5.0|This album was what you would call &quot;HYPE&quot;.  Marshall Mathers has lyrics that will make you think about your life, your existence, what struggles you have or have not gone through, etc.  I will be a true fan of  Eminem for years to come.  Keep up the good work.
0440211727|5.0|This has to be John Grisham's best work. It combines a great story with a great message. He blended suspense, morals, and information to form a wonderful story. Everyone should read this book.
B000002L9J|5.0|This review is not particularly necessary, as many of the other reviews here say it all, but the point is being missed by some, I think.  The Smiths were a British band - perhaps the most 'English' band of all time.   Hence, rather than dealing with absolutes in the way that renders all but  the most subtle American writers unpalatable to my own English  constitution, The Smiths juxtapositioned the elements of their songs,  lacing the saddest moments with a wry, graveyard humour, tainting a  beautiful melody with a brutal lyric, knocking you off kilter during a  vibrant 'feel-good' moment with a heartbreaking line that shifts the whole  emphasis of the song.  The Smiths were serious, but they were  laugh-out-loud funny too.  Their music was a new start - like nothing that  came before it but the forerunner to almost every British guitar band since  (even the awfulness that is Oasis). The only comparable band is REM who -  just to confirm that I'm not anti-American in case that's what you're  thinking - have since gone on to even greater artistic heights than The  Smiths.  From '83-'87 though, there was no-one better.  If you want  something startlingly out of the ordinary (and it still is, despite the  diminishing affect of endless imitators), buy this album.  Having said  that, if, like Carmarthen and some others, you're likely to completely miss  the point, then don't bother.  Honestly, if I had 1 for every time someone  had said that The Smiths were just a depressing 80's band...... (etc etc)
B00000J6AG|5.0|Must listen to it no matter which stile you follow. His best so far
B00004T9UF|5.0|Well, well, well.  All those who critised eminems first publicly released album have been hit in the face hard, by this mindblowing album.  Whether you like to admit it or not, Eminem is here to stay, and hes doing a damned  good job at it to.  I thught that when Em was signed to Dre's label, that  he would follow the Dr's orders and be exactly like him, but Em has widened  his horizons and brought out a truely astonishing album, that will probably  go better than te TRIPLE PLATINUM of his first album, the slim shady LP.  <br /> Speaking now of the content of the album, he has stepped up a notch in  his beats as well as his ability to rap.  If any of you have heard Em's  underground album, Infinite, you will understand that he has got so much  better form when he was just another wannabe rap superstar.  There are a  few songs witch really make this album original.  First of all The real  slim shady, in this song Em discusses (if you can call it that) what people  think of him, and what he thinks of them, hence the inclusion of Britney  Spears, and Chrisina Agulera (i know that isnt how you spell her name but  hey, who cares, your here to read about Eminem).  Stan, this shows Em's  humanity, but i would actually like to known the realism that accompanies  this song, did stan really exist?  Also criminal, this is such a  condradiction of his songs at the begining of the album, but anyway buy it  from Amazon and see right?  <br /> This really is a good album to buy, i  bought it the day it came out in England, and i loved it form the second i  put it in my CD player, its just pure quality.  Also i beg you not to  listen to the people who are just out to make this album sound rubbish,  they are obiously fans of a different nature of music, who have nothing  better to do, and hey, if you dont like the album, then sell it to your  mates, huh?  <br /> One more time loud as you can, how does it go? Great album  Em, and if your reading, i hope you do some more stuff in England, that  concert in 1998 was phat.
0684872153|5.0|Mr. McCourt has given us a rare and touching glimpse into what must have been a very difficult childhood.  As devastating as poverty of this magnitude can be, he was able to raise us above the sadness with humor,  wit, and heart warming stories. I can honestly say that I did not want to  read this book.  I knew it would be a downer.   That it was, in some ways,  but it also lifted my spirits and made me think about the resilience of the  human spirit. I felt such a connection with this book because it helped me  remember the details of my life with new reverence and appreciation.  Thank  you, Mr. McCourt.

B00004T9UF|2.0|Allright, see I like eminem, but sometimes I don't like the language.  Yeah, go ahead call me whatever you want.  But just a warning to you youngun' virgin ears.  If you can hardly handle the edited &quot;Real Slim  Shady&quot; well don't buy it.  I have the whole edited CD and sometimes i  just hear nothing in the song for a few seconds while they edited out all  his perverted comments that made him so &quot;great&quot;.    I'll give it  up a little.  Some song on here are good, but if your expectin to hear fun,  hyper songs Like &quot;Real Slim Shady&quot; Maybe you should try something  else.  This is one of the CD's I'm hoping to sell to somebody.
B0000047EC|5.0|You cant go wrong with a album by Pat. It shows how he has changed his style compared with his earlier albums, and it really is a great CD. Money well spent!
B000002KDS|5.0|This is probably my favorite record period.  Every song on Killer is great. The song,Desparado, has a Jim Morrison/Doors influence to it. Dead Babies,which is anti child abuse song, was Alice's  most misunderstood song  he ever wrote. Under my wheels, Halo of flies,Yeah Yeah Yeah, and Be My  Lover all really rock.  The album  orgasmicly ends with title track,  Killer.  If you don't have this cd, do yourself a favor and get it.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is really a great film. Very meditative to me. The interplay between Cruise, who gives a performance which is just beyond belief, and his father is remarkable. The end is very unique and special. Alot of credit to those  involved.
B00004RFDW|5.0|Despite all of the buzz, hype, great reviews and so forth, I maintained a complete lack of interest in seeing The Insider.  American Beauty was my movie of the year, and no matter how good Insider was, it couldn't surpass  that masterpiece.  Hmmm... lesson learned.<br />I think that this is a  fantastic movie, primarily as a result of the phenomenal performance of  Russel Crowe - for those of you who have seen Gladiator, it's almost  impossible to believe that these charaters are played by the same person.   His bearing, demeanor, appearance, movements, etc. ad naseum are so subtle  and different that it is a joy to watch!<br />I was skeptical, too, that the  story would hold my interest, particularly given the fact that the pulic  has been made aware that tobacco companies' knowledge of the addictive  qualities of cigarettes - harldy earthshattering now whether or not it was  then.  But it is utterly fascinating watching the behind the scenes  maneuvering at CBS and the threat of lawsuits should they air the piece.   And while Crowe's character is not the most pleasant of individuals, Crowe  manages to make him likable to the extent that you really care about what  happens to him as Wigan (sp?).  It is a great movie, and I think EVERONE  should be sure not to miss the chance to see it!  This comes with my  highest recommendation, despite the fact that one can't always quite tell  what is the producers' artistic license and what actually happened!
B00000IN5G|5.0|if you don't have this album, buy it. they are identical todimmu borgir, but play 1/10th of a degree faster
B000002LFZ|4.0|Excellent CD but it's missing a couple of cuts that should have been included.  My teenage son &amp; daughter love it too.
B000001GK9|5.0|I begin by saying I am a devout Mahlerite.  I think pound for pound Bernstein owned Mahler, however......this cd OOOZES with beauty.  As stuffy as Karajan could be (don't get me wrong the man is an absolute  genius! )here,  he excells!I adore music in all its forms and for the sake  of this review, must confess, am very shaky with musical description (this  cd is too visceral).  That being said, my simple advice is this...block out  an hour and a half of your so, so, important time, grab an intoxicant of  your choice, a warm body and unwind!  If alone i recommend as little  clothes as possible.  Seriously, Gustav never sounded so gooey!  Enjoy, it  is a multi-emotive journey!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Maiden have always been to me one of the greatest bands ever and i'm quite sure there are many out there who share my viewpoint. It saddens me to see that despite this they remain to this day portrayed as one of the  &quot;hair bands&quot; who died back in the 80s. While their dress back  then was questionable (at least they didn't wear makeup) they stand as  possibly the most influential metal band of all time (sorry Sabbath but  your out of your league when it comes to Maiden). However they did flounder  pretty badly in the 90s with albums like No Prayer For The Dying, Fear of  the Dark and then just got plain bad with X-Factor and Virtual XI. Yet  these four albums are a LOT better then the grunge and rapmetal released  during the same time. Unlike Sabbath who haven't done anything worthwhile  since the obscure 82' album Heaven and Hell (another sad fact considering  it was far better then Paranoid, Ozzy isn't anything next to Dio), Maiden  have managed to come back in 2000 after a bad decade in the 90s with this  incredibly strong new album. To say this is a return to form is an  understatement. AC/DC and KISS had good &quot;returns to form&quot; with  Stiff Upper Lip and Pyscho Circus. This is something else entirely. This  is, personally, what I think is their 2nd best album next to the godlike  Number Of The Beast. There isn't ONE BAD SONG on the ENTIRE album and the  songs go on for some time too so theres plenty of music to listen to.  Everyone and their brother knows that Bruce and Adrian are back here and  they are better then ever. The vocals are ridiculous they are so good and  the overall guitar work and solos especially show some strong improvement  with Mr.Smith back in the fold. If you like metal then buy this, if you  don't like metal then buy this. If you don't buy this but like metal then  your possibly the biggest hypocrite I can think of, go buy some Limp Bizkit  or Kid Rock and cut your hair. UP THE IRONS!
B000001FI7|5.0|This is definitely another five-star item from me. Every time I listen to it, no matter how long it's sat in my CD shelf (forgotten, but only temporarily and never for too long), I am constantly surprised by how great  it is...ahh the joy of &quot;rediscovering&quot; a favorite.<br />Dark and  moody, much of the album sounds like a memory...of a place you've been  once, or a movie you saw, or music you heard as you drove by an open window  or door late one night in the city. Some of it is incredibly sexy (like  &quot;Numb,&quot; &quot;Pedestal,&quot; and the awesome &quot;Glory  Box&quot;), other parts are mournful (like &quot;Biscuit,&quot; &quot;Sour  Times,&quot; &quot;It's a Fire,&quot; and &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot;),  and still more are mysterious or just plain funky (&quot;Mysterions&quot;  and &quot;Strangers&quot;).<br />It's really hard to pick a favorite song on  this album...almost all of them perfectly fit different moods I have at  different times. They seem to encompass an incredibly vast range of modern  urban sensitivities. &quot;Sour Times&quot; is, of course, wonderfully  reminiscent of a moody classic spy flick while a song like  &quot;Strangers&quot; bounces back and forth between an intense, pulsing  beat like a walk through the club district of a large city and gentle,  delicate interludes like the dawn over the Sea of Japan.<br />My least  favorite is &quot;Wandering Star,&quot; which I think is a bit too  repetative, but even that I'm willing to listen to without much  complaint.<br />Smoothly sexy, definitely modern, and particularly urban,  *Dummy* is a classic and well worth your time and money.
B000021XS0|5.0|1999 had some amazingly strong albums in it including new releases from Emperor, Nevermore, Dillinger Escape Plan, Arch Enemy and Children of Bodom among others. However despite the excellent albums released by each and  everyone of these amazing bands I still have no reserves in saying that  this, the newest album from Dream Theater, was the single greatest  selection of music released during the year. The production is solid, the  story and overall flow of the album (being it is a concept album) is done  to perfection, way past The Wall by Pink Floyd. Last but not least is the  incredible demonstration of sheer musicial ability put on display here.  These guys know each of their instruments with great detail and are very  aware how to make the most out of them. Quite simply, this album is a  must-buy for those into metal and rock in general. For those who feel that  real music died back with bands like The Doors, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd  need to shed their stubborn attitudes and realize how Dream Theater not  only carries forth the legacy of such bands but improves upon it in a  myriad of ways. (The new Iron Maiden album is good too!)
0930289234|5.0|I confess I am not a fan of Gibbons' art, but Alan Moore's writing is nothing short of genius.  The sheer density of these narratives, the visual puns and structural devices interwoven with complex characterizations and  memorable dialogue... one is simply stunned at the final achievement.  This  is a magnum opus, a masterpiece, a colossal work within its genre.  One is  breathtaken at the imaginative generosity Moore displays, creating his  world in such detail.
0671027344|5.0|this book was completey true with every word.  it was liketaking a high school and gathering all the thoughts and fears of everyperson and combining them to make Charlie.  he is a combination of every person i know, including myself.  anyone can find themselves in him.  I recommend this book- 2 thumbs up!
B000002UAU|5.0|Some people think that this is the most overrated album of all time, but I don't think so . I would bestow that dubious accolade on Led Zeppelin IV (or any other Led Zeppelin album), or Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of The  Moon&quot;.However it isn't my favourite album of all time either. It is  certainly a 5 star album however, and people who give this album 1 star are  just being vindictive.My personal favourite Beatles album is Abbey Road,  NOT Revolver, and I think the White Album is kind of overrated(but still  good). If anyone hasn't heard this album (IS there anyone?) I would like  you to think of it as a classic of popular music, but not a religious  artifact.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is easily the best novel that I have ever read.  This book tops the Lord of the Rings like no other book has.  Has no competition in greatness.
B000002IOJ|4.0|I like this album a lot.  It's not as heavy as the first ones, nor as the latest ones.  But there's a lot of good stuff on this one!  Musically, verbally, and productionally.  Testament is an awesome band, and this, like  every one of their albums I've heard, is awesome also.  Sure, styles  change.  But unlike most other bands, every style is good!  I highly  suggest anyone into &quot;POP&quot; get this album as well as 'The Ritual'  and 'Souls of Black' and hear what REAL music sounds like!
0593044703|3.0|the scales are balanced in this book. There are very good reasons why one should not even bother buying the book, and then there are reasons why one should buy  and read the book. Steven Erikson is a very good suspense  writer, but lacks the skills to deftly introduce complex characters and  sub-plots. He uses the aid of a Dramatis Personae and a glossary. A  glossary is forgivable, but having both is indicative of poor writing  skills with regards to characters and complex themes prevalent throughout  the book. The fact that there is no clear protagonist is irkesome. The  plots seems to focus on Capt.Paran and then jumps to another central  character Crokus. Granted both are important to the book's progression, but  the fact that the readers is abruptly jerked to another location, different  scene, and one has to get to love a(the second on, that is). Erikson  developed an interesting mythology - Ascendents - or gods as we know them -  have provided a refreshing take on the whole plot. Another irksome  dimension is that fantasy readers are used to the fact that gods, or  ascendents in this case, are to be all-powerful, all-knowing, but that  illusion is shattered. Granted that originality is central to success, but  even then one should conform to the dictates of the market. I am all for  the art of writing, but Erikson carries it to extremes. What really got me  through the book was my human need to know what in the heck is going to  happen next. I know the empress is the bad person, but what of anomander  Rake?  I suppose there are no heroes in this one. What was truely  disturbing was the excessive bloodletting and the detailed murders  prevalent in the book. A bit on the extreme side, but it did take the  reader away from the monotony of a twisted political climate. Some part of  the book is hauntingly familiar. Stalwart fantasy readers, if reading the  book carefully, can see faint traces of David Eddings and Raymond E feist.  In conclusion i have to say thatSteven Erikson can become one of the  greatest fantasy writers if he only schucked the deep-seated need to not  cram every esoteric and complex character into x amount of pages and botch  the job at that. He can go a long way, if his work is not so similar to  janny Wurts. As i told a friend:&quot;All that the book needs is a good  editor!&quot;
B000009QOC|5.0|Well, I first heard this album on a sh***ty fourth generation tape back in 1990 and it has been number one on my list since then. I like the juxtaposition of what feels like slow southern twang with unspeakable evil  - its original, and it works. Unfortunately, glenn didn't go down the  acoustic-satanic-crooner road like I prayed he would when the band walked  out on him (or whatever), instead he hooked up with computers. Lucifuge is  Danzigs best work ever, excluding perhaps &quot;Come Back&quot; (misfits)  and the 50s rock stuff of early misfits stuff.  Glenn - if you're reading  this, put away the synth stuff, pick up a guitar, and CROON BABY CROON
B00001NFCY|1.0|After Creed excellent debut album, I was expecting good things from this band.  However, I cannot say that I have found one track I enjoyed.  There are many albums that grow on you, just listen to a few times and you enjoy  them, Weezer - Pinkerton being one of them.  I've listened to this cd 6  times, and each time, I can't wait to finish the darn thing.<br />  The lyrics  are conistantly lame, reptition through out, and a cheesy christiany pop  type of message, comapred to the deeper and darker lyrics of My Own Prison.   Example would be &quot;What If&quot; where it seems he screams &quot;What  If&quot; for a good 30 seconds.  <br />  The music also leaves much to be  desired.  My Own prison had a dark, mellow, edgy sound, while Human Clay  has a Brittany Spears mixed with Metallica sound.  An example of this is  the guitar on Higher... &quot;Can you take me HIIGHERRR, *lame guitar  here*&quot;.<br />   This album was one big disappointment after another.  I  would say that Creed sold out, however I dont know too many people that are  buying the second album.
B00001U03Q|5.0|This CD shows what Eric Clapton is all about. Full of talent and romance makes you want to listen over and over again.
068484267X|3.0|This book was a page-turner and kept me interested from beginning to end. Unfortunately, it did not live up to all the hype surrounding its publication. I was ultimately disappointed that the funny parts weren't  funnier and the sad parts sadder. In a nutshell, the characters in the  book: Drink, drink, have a baby, drink,have another baby, bury a baby,  drink, go to church,have a baby, drink, bury a baby, drink, drink, go to  church, and drink. They are desperately poor and feel very sentimental  about Ireland, so they also sing songs while drinking, having babies,  burying babies, or attending church. I love Irish writers; they are natural  story-tellers, and McCourt is no exception. And I guess it says something  that at least a few of the babies survived to become successful adults. But  the constant theme of wallowing in sorrow was pretty depressing.
0385421982|5.0|After reading &quot;The Firm,&quot; I thought that John Grisham could not possible outdo himself, that is until I read &quot;The Pelican Brief.&quot; After having witnessed a murder, Darby Shaw seeks the help of an ambitious  reporter. After putting all the pieces together, Shaw discovers that the  murder was intended for her. And that's when the fun really begins. I  haven't seen the movie version of this book. Is it better than the book?  Nah, I doubt it. This is an intense thriller that should be read in one  sitting. John Grisham rules, and if you agree with me, say &quot;I.&quot;
B000002572|5.0|What can you say about an album that you can literally remember where you were when you first heard it? This classic rock masterpiece has so much substance that it is not only a great achievement in the history of rock music but it has become legendary as well.... Tom Scholz and Brad Delp are a perfect  match. Brad Delp has the best Rock-n-Roll voice, ever. Perfect pitch and  amazing harmonies. Tom is a master. Soaring guitars and crystal clear  vocals make this album a must have. Listen to the record and slip away.  Everybody listen!  DC, Austin, TX
B00004RHZU|5.0|This CD is awesome! Pink is an incredible song writer with an amazing voice! &quot;Most girls&quot; is my favorite, but the whole albums great!
B000024D4R|5.0|I started listening to PF around &quot;Saucer...&quot; and quit shortly after &quot;Final Cut&quot;.  This one is my personal favorite as an album, because it marks a point where some new ideas in sound development make  their appearance.  Developments that we take for granted in later works,  are joyously experimented with here.  Case in point:  the concept of a  &quot;Sound Envelope&quot;.  The sound of a dog barking has a very definite  overall shape.  If you take that shape, and fill it with other sounds, what  kind of effects can you achieve?  You'll find that here, in  &quot;Dogs&quot;, with amazing results.  In &quot;Sheep&quot;, there are  some seamless transitions from voice to instrument that are nothing less  than astonishing.  And of course, beyond that, this is classic PF, and  nothing to sneer at.  Approaching thirty years old, (can you believe it?),  and still way-good headphone material.  Take a listen.
0446677450|5.0|I don't like to read, and I am a very slow reader. This book is over 200pgs. and I finished it in one day. It's that interesting. I would recomend it to anyone who wants to take control of their financial  situation.
B000001YOW|4.0|This CD is great music.  It's not for everyone.  My father can't listen to anything with a guitar in it, and that's fine.  This music is quite raw, with simple and date-stamped lyrics that time may not be kind to.  There's  a &quot;grunge&quot; aspect that turns many people off, but I find if you  get past that, there's a level of sophistication that fairly reeks of Pink  Floyd in its early years.  (I'm talking &quot;Umma Gumma&quot; here.)  I  see traces of Alan Parson's Project style as well.  And there's much that  is new and unique.  I think the middle of this album is absolutely  mesmerizing, with it's narrative vocal style.  Another thing I just can't  quite get over is the album cover: It sets a sort of &quot;after-death -  purgatory&quot; tone to the entire CD, and actually adds to the effects of  the musical imagery.  This is a good album in an absolute sense.  Whether  it works for you depends on your tastes.
0767849493|5.0|Dogma isn't all about to stupid angels. But it's about our society and our religion. Kevin Smith tried to show that even our faith, is prejudice. It's an awakening. One for the collection. Ah!  And this movie is really really  funny.
0767812778|5.0|This is quite simply the best movie I have ever seen.  One of the best directors of our time tells the true (if dramaticized) story of a remarkable man in a remarkable time and place.  The time Lean spent  developing the environmental backdrop and the characters was well worth the  effort, as it adds a complexity and depth to the plot rarely seen in movies  today.  The desert itself provided all the &quot;Special Effects&quot;  necessary.  The scene at the well, early on, where Lawrence befriends his  bedou guide, only to see him killed a short time later, is a shocking, if  accurate statement of the situation in Arabia at the time.  But don't  confuse this with the plot itself, which occurs at a much higher level.   Otherwise the movie's length will get to you after a while.  It's very easy  to get lost in the details, and that's one of the lessons about humankind  you will get from this film.  Oh, did I mention that O'toole and Sharif are  at their very best in this film? (Among others...)<br />It is unfortunate that  the film was - had to be - as short as it was.  Lawrence as the  &quot;Miracle Worker&quot; seems almost superhuman, when in fact the events  that transpired did so in a slightly less awe-inspiring speed.  If you are  interested in a more accurate picture of the events, I suggest you read  &quot;The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom&quot;, written by Lawrence himself.   (Then go back and see the movie again.) Then see &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;  - a comparable film, and even &quot;Dune&quot; - which seems to share some  of its roots with the &quot;Lawrence&quot; story.<br />If you haven't seen  this film, and you like complex stories, you're in for a real treat.
B000002UA2|4.0|One of the more obscure of the Pink Floyd albums, \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" was written as a soundtrack for Barbet Schroeder's film, \\"La Vallee,\\" about a group of hippies seeking enlightenment in a lost valley in New Guinea.  The  album opens with two instrumentals, the synthesizer-driven \\"Obscured By  Clouds,\\" followed by the guitar-heavy \\"When You're In.\\"  A ballad, written  by Roger Waters and Rick Wright, \\"Burning Bridges,\\" has a certain quality,  a sound, that seems to be a harbinger of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\"  Another  cut, with the unlikely title of \\"Wot's...Uh, The Deal,\\" is a terrific song,  somewhat wistful and introspective, and is the highlight of the album; it's  right up there with any of Floyd's best songs.  Another Waters-Wright  composition is the somewhat melancholy \\"Stay,\\" which has a sense of quiet  intensity about it.  Then there's the rollicking \\"Free Four,\\" which is  tremendously upbeat, especially when you consider the dark content of the  lyrics; it's one of the first instances in which Roger Waters deals  (musically) with the death of his father, which would become a recurring  theme later on, especially in \\"The Wall,\\" and on \\"The Final Cut.\\"  The last  track on the album is \\"Absolutely Curtains,\\" which ends with the chanting  of the Mapuga Tribe of New Guinea, which was recorded on location in New  Guinea; an interesting cut, to say the least.  Though one of the  lesser-known pieces of the Pink Floyd canon, \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is,  nevertheless, a remarkable album in it's own right; and it definitely must  be included in any Pink Floyd collection.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|The visuals in this film are stunning.  Unfortunately, the sound does not match up.  I'm refering to the profusion of westernised accents (especially Eddie Murphy's) and the songs.  I find them very jarring in the presence of  the beautifully rendered visuals of the Great Wall, Mulan's homestead, etc.   <br />For kids, at least for western kids, this is certainly not a fatal  flaw, but it does lower the enjoyment for me.  A movie like Aladdin seems  to do a better job presenting a west-friendly version of the culture,  rather than a parody thereof.<br />Having complained about that, however, I  have to say this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Murphy's dragon  (forgetting the American slang) is highly entertaining, Mulan is a heroine  you want to cheer for, and the supporting characters are lovable.  The  villian is a little flat (especially when compared with my favourites,  Gaston and Jafar), but he is certainly menacing.  Maybe a bit too menacing  for really small children - this movie seems little intense for the really  young kids.<br />The extras are not impressive, since they had to cram both  the letterbox and P&amp;S on the same disc.  Why they do this is beyond me  - just dispense with the P&amp;S and give me more extras!

B000002UVX|5.0|Imagine hearing this album for the first time on the ear-plug &quot;mono&quot; headphones of a battery operated Panasonic mini reel-to-reel tape recorder. Now imagine that that annoying background noise  spoiling the mood is from exploding Viet Cong 122mm rockets while you're  hunkered down, cold, hungry, and wet from that incessant goddamn monsoon  rain. But you're smiling at every riff 'cause you know Jimi knows what  you're thinking. Maybe you're surrounded by living hell, but somehow...THIS  MAKES YOU SANE! It's been 30 years since I first &quot;experienced&quot;  Band of Gypsies. Nothing else will ever come close to having the same  meaning to this old 'Nam vet.
B00004RIV4|4.0|The first time I heard &quot;Bring it back&quot; on the radio, I thought: 'Ok, yet another shallow pop dance act who don't know how to sing or write lyrics and make good music.&quot; But, oh my, I was so very wrong. Moloko's  album is the most creative and innovative I've heard in years. It proves  that technology alone doesn't create good songs (cf. most monotonous techno  music), the people behind it do. &quot;Things to make and do&quot;  is...well, I wouldn't call it revolutionary, because we already had  Portishead and Björk and Moloko themselves have been making music for some  time, but to me it's very white albumish, if you know what I mean. It's  very eclectic, many different styles on it, but yet also very consistent. I  don't like all the songs on it, because sometimes a nice melodic line is  missing. Roisin's voice is absolutely fascinating and mesmerizing. The  lyrics are meaningful and at times humorous. Replay: Pure Pleasure Seeker,  The Time Is Now, Absent Minded Friends and Dumb Inc. Skip: If You Have a  Cross...<br />Are you still reading this review?  Go and get this cd! You'll  be stunned!
B00003CWN3|5.0|I was at first puzzled that director Kim Peirce had placed Lana at the murder scene, but I realized later that it was her way of showing Lana's love for Brandon. Lana never felt deceived even as Brandon, standing in his  jail cell fully aware there is nothing he can say or do to hide the fact  that he is a woman, looks painfully into her eyes to hear her say, &quot;I  don't care.&quot; In their own way, it was a cheerful, loving moment of  their relationship. Only the audience knew the doom; to Brandon and Lana,  it was the beginning.<br />The killings were unjustifiable, but I really felt  compassion for the two killers. They weren't anonymous or cold, they were  human beings like Brandon, struggling to find their own identities. Peirce  painted a vivid picture of their dead-end lives, forgotten just for a  moment through alcohol and drugs. The time-lapsed cinematography of the  smoke billowing from the factories, the clouds flying through the sky, the  characters seemed suspended helplessly in their personal hell.<br />Even as  Brandon is savagely raped, we're not asked to feel pity for Brandon, nor  anger at the rapists who were once his friends. It was a venting of the  frustration of their inability to be what they don't know how -- that only  Brandon was able to do -- be loving. From their broken homes, respect for  women, or even for themselves, was never on the list. <br />Boys Don't Cry. I  didn't cry, but I knew deep inside my heart, I was crying for Brandon,  Lana, John, and Tom, and the two innocent victims. It will never be the  same.
0446310786|3.0|This is an interesting adventure book which highlights racial predjudice in 1930's America.<br />It cites the adventures of Jem and Jean-Louise (Scout) Finch and their relationship with their Lawyer father Atticus.<br />It's a  book of characters, each with their own unique personalities.  You get a  sense of intrigue and suspense when you read about the infamous Boo  Radley.<br />On the whole this is a pleasant book which has stood the test of  time.
0780622553|5.0|This was sadly a sleeper in the box office, probably due to the theatrical trailer that made the film look more like some sort of demonic tale than what it was really about.<br />The special effects are out of this world, but  there aren't many of them... you don't need to see a lot of special effects  in this highly cerebral tale of realistic terror.<br />A city that seems to  never have sunlight and everyone goes to sleep at midnight.... well, almost  everyone.

B00001NFCY|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out.  I love every song on the CD.  Creed is the only band that produces albums complete with songs that I can listen to over and over.  Basically, if you liked &quot;My Own Prison,&quot;  you'll love &quot;Human Clay.&quot;
B00004TDVV|3.0|I found the music like any other great American alternative group.  The songs were good, especially &quot;Leader of Men.&quot;  Get the CD, you won't be dissapointed.
6304401132|5.0|I love this movie. Sleeping Beauty has been my favorite ever since I first saw it, and still is. The animation, the story, the music . . . Disney really created a masterpiece.   Almost everyone knows the classic story of  Sleeping Beauty, where a young princess pricks her finger on a spinning  wheel and falls into a deep sleep; all because a wicked fairy didn't get  invited to the princess's celebration. With the help of the good fairies,  the prince hacks thorns and kills a dragon (the evil fairy) to save her.  Though Disney alters the tale somewhat, as it does with all its movies, it  is still a wonderful movie. HIGHLY recommended, for young and old and  in-between!
B000001DQI|4.0|This is the record that earned Elton his superstar status and it's easy to see why. It is filled to the brim with classic rock staples like Bennie and the Jets, the title track, Saturday Nights Alright for Fighting, and of  course Candle in the Wind. It also has some hidden gems that aren't played  every hour on the hour on radio like Grey Seal, This Song Has No Title, and  Funeral For A Friend. The only problem I have is that there are a few songs  (Jamaica Jerk Off in particular) that are just awful and should not be on  this album. That is why I am witholding the fifth star. But other than  that, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is a superbly crafted pop album that if you  like Elton John, you should definitely own.
0780628551|5.0|Okay, I'm going to upset the apple cart here, I enjoyed this film.  Johnny Depp was great as the possessed Astronaut who returns to earth after a space walk goes wrong.  Charlize Theron didn't do too badly either as his  super-sexy wife who isn't quite sure what is going on other than she is  pregnant and there's a chance her children just might not be human.  Yes it  is slow moving, yes it is an odd film but despite that it works for me.  The special effects aren't all that, but this is more of a film for those  of a cerebral nature and a lot is left to your own imagination.  The film  asks the question &quot;what if&quot; aliens didn't haven't to take human  form, &quot;what if&quot; they could attune themselves to a certain  electrical frequency, and take control of a human mind; after all we are  just electrical brain waves, our mind generating minute amounts of  electricity, similar to those generated in say a satellite?  As Charlize  realizes that all is not well with her husband, she struggles to make sense  of what is going on.  Why did her husband's fellow space walker die so  suddenly after returning to earth?  And his wife was pregnant when she  committed suicide, not only pregnant but pregnant with twins, the same as  Charlize.  Should she have an abortion or should she continue with her  pregnancy?  Charlize doesn't know which way to turn.  Her instincts are to  abort but her desire to be a mother is great.  The suspense in the film is  well orchestrated with Depp giving a solid performance as the man/alien  intent on his offspring being born.  He tells his wife whilst pointing at  her pregnant belly &quot;I live in there&quot; so that she knows he is  aware of everything she thinks and does.  This is a creepy film with an  equally creepy ending that is both intelligent and thought provoking.  However I will concede it is not everyone's cup of tea but all the same it  really is quite a good little film despite the heavy panning it got from  critics and viewers.viewers.
B00004T9UF|5.0|...em combines funny lyrics with real depth and he is not afraidto say what he feels. the CD is awesome and i cant compare it to theother one cuz they are too different but i loved both of them!peace
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have rarely seen a film which so envelops you in its world like Princess Mononoke. It's truly one of the most beautiful and involving and influential movies I've ever seen. There are images in it that you've never  seen before.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Tim Burton doesn't waste a single frame - every moment advances the storytelling.  Compares favorably to &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; in that both artfully blend gothic horror with a certain lightness of mood and  humor that keep the viewer absorbed at all times.  Design, cinematography,  effects, audio - a feast!  Plus, the very rich DVD transfer &quot;shows  off&quot; what this format can do.  &quot;Making of&quot; documentary  greatly enhances  enjoyment.  Absolutely loved.
0060930187|5.0|this is a wonderful novel.  the language is beautiful and poetic which is one of the ways that it is a different story than catcher in the rye.  esther greenwood typifies a lot of 19-20 year olds in the fact that at  times we all feel alone and trapped in a world that we look at through a  &quot;bell jar&quot;.  even if this wasn't based on plath's life, it is not  a far fetched story and the descriptive and poetic elements really bring  this novel to life.
6304798482|5.0|This a great kind of movie that justs lets you have fun! You almost root for the bugs! Buy this movie!
0195067142|5.0|they need to read this. What an unassuming, straightforward account of two of the Pacific Theater's most terrible campaigns. Even more, what an account of life for the combat marine. Flies in c-rations, maggots on your  clothes, sleep deprivation, and the sacrifice of men for their fellow men -  it's all in this account. Never does Dr. Sledge, who was interviewed by  Studs Terkel in The Good War, glorify himself in any way. He simply focuses  on the daily struggle to survive and keep one's sanity. These were men who  had a job to do, and they did it as well as they possibly could in  sub-human conditions those who did not experience it could not believe.  It's well-written in a down-to-earth style one might expect of a biology  professor. The irony of a man who faced the dead every day returning home  to study and teach about life is typical of men who went through his  experiences.<br />This is a fine read about men at war against the Japanese,  the elements, themselves, and the struggle to maintain sanity. Highly  recommend.
6305531374|3.0|The Halloween series is one of the best horror series out there. I personally think every entry to this series was good  to a point, i like em all. Now Halloween H20 is a very ver good movie, but it seems to miss some  of the magic and atmoshpere of the other films; including three. I think  that H20 shoud tied in ALL the entries but alsa it only focuses on 1-2. The  thorn sub polt is great, and gives a little clarity  to the celtic word   written in blood  in part 2. Hopefully in the next entry they will tie in  EVERYTHING. I also that the movie pack in the suspense, but the scares were  limited for me since the mask in all my bluntness is stupid looking. It  seems to show to much expression. In the other films  the mask looked  like  pure unadultrted evil. If they had another mask  from any of the other  movies I would believe that this movie would have been a lot higher in the  scare factor.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Great plot. Suspenseful, enigmatic, great ending... SEE IT! I am Nik's enjoyment of this movie.
0380018179|5.0|I am usually not a big fan of romance novels...so it is a big suprise to me that this is one of my all-time favorite books.  I think one of the most difficult tasks as an author is to describe characters that are not only  well-rounded, but believable as humans. In the Thorn Birds we love the  characters for their human flaws, and struggles.  For example, Ralph's  struggle between his love for God, his love for Meggie and his undying  ambitions. What I loved most about this book is it's realism. None of that  hollywood, unrealistic, happily ever after cliched garbage. The characters  must face fate which is not always helpful (ex/spoilers when the fire kills  Patty &amp; Board Stewy).  And like in many families, our lives turns out  to be like that of our parents.  (Meggie's like is very similar to that of  her mother).  <br />If you are ready to love/hate characters, be engrossed in  one of the most passionate yet tragic love stories of all time..this book  is a must.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I think this one can officially be called a classic.  If there's any heavy metal fan on this planet that hasn't heard this, you are missing out.  Blind Guardian has crafted there own style and should not be lumped in with  the Hammerfall's and Helloween's of this world.  This has much to due with  Hansi Kursch's unique songwriting and vocal style.  At many points his  voice cuts through you like a saw blade and at other points it floats  around you like a butterfly.  Hansi doesn't write conventional power metal  songs.  They are more progressive at times than power metal and he has the  ability of making a melody where others less talented could not.  Granted,  this CD will probably take a couple of listens to grow on the average  listener.  The reason is as stated before, it is unconventional as power  metal goes.  However, the rewards of this CD are great.  An alltime  classic!
B00003CWPR|3.0|Stanley Kubrick's last, and perhaps most intiment film isprobably better to be seen on smaller screen. Reason one: Kubrickpreffered it to be seen on full screen, 1:1.37 aspect ratio, which is not the way the film was usually screened in theatres. Reason two: to achieve his dream of making a film as simply as possible, Kubrick tried almost not to use artificial &quot;movie&quot; lighting on the set, and force-proccessed the negative and prints. This caused a lot of granes and desaturated colors in most of the dupe prints used in theatrical presentations. Only journalists who could see prints of better generation could really apprecieate the beauty of the photography and the inteligence in the use of colors. Reason three: it's such a complex movie you really can't understnad it in one viewing.  Reason four, which would have been only applicable in the US and Canada, was the digital modification to get an R rating. BUT, the studio preffered to release this mutilated version even on DVD! This is really a disgrace for the American public. The Studio should release the original version, as MGM did on LAST TANGO IN PARIS. The DVD special feature is interviews with Stiephen Spielberg (I don't know why) as well as the stars of the film Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Cruise is surprisingly honest about his difficulties in making this film, nothing like what he used to say a year ago to promote the film. Kidman shows what an inteligent and capable actress she really is inspite of her pretty figure. This film, I think is really her movie. Kubrick, who always portraid men rather than women (even LOLITA was more about James Mason character than Sue Lyon), finally portraid a living woman with depth, full of desires and fears of sexuality. The mistake, I think, of the old master is that he is still showing too much of the husband (who is rather boring) and not showing enough of her.  EYES WIDE SHUT is a flawed film, perhaps. But it still is filled of poignant moments and passion, and one of the greatest achievement in cinema to describe human psyche.  END

B00000IQC8|5.0|This film is easily one of the top five films in the history of film making. Pardon my hyperbole, yet I feel so strongly about everything behind Clerks that it just wouldn't do it justice to rate it.  If you enjoy  extremely clever, humorous, dramatic,wordy, superbly-written, vulgar,  brilliant films, buy Clerks as soon as you are capable of doing so.
0375707972|4.0|I found 'The Reader' to be very addictive and quick.  Before I knew it, I was well into the book.  While the story is on some levels possibly disturbing, I found the overall effect to be more thought provoking.   The  writing is very economical and to the point.  It conjures up images and  feelings of love and lost and insecurity and wonder that everyone can  relate to and grasp.  In all it is a sombering tale of human nature that  sticks in your head well after you've put the book down.  I enjoyed it very  very much.
B000009QPE|5.0|This album is amazing. It's a half hour of pure adrenaline rush! Song after song, these guys pound on you with the highest quality speed metal in existence. Even after 15 years no one has come close to this album, not even Slayer themselves! They must have made a deal with the devil when they hit the recording studio for this one. Best songs on here are Angel of Death, Jesus Saves, and Raining Blood.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is awesome.. I would recommend it if you like Eminem.. or you like rap music.. He uses free speech in this CD which makes it even better!    ***** The BEST!  *****
B000009QPE|5.0|Pay no attention to the poor ratings. This is by far the most superior metal album ever to be released. If you're looking for an album that lives up to its genre (100% pure thrash metal), then Reign in Blood is it.
0783231032|3.0|1941 is a perfect example of the term &quot;less is more&quot;.The film has some amazing scenes(that dance scene will become a classic)but this films big budget led to huge and overlong scenes which made the movie  bloated and slow in parts.But this movie is still an amazing spectacular to  watch.Steven Spielberg learned the &quot;less is more&quot; lesson from  this film and cut back the original shooting schedule of &quot;Raiders Of  the Lost Ark&quot;,turning it into a lean,entertaining movie.
B00000J8EK|2.0|Now, call me dumb if you like, but this release just does not drill it'sway into my consciousness. Maybe it'll kick out some trance jams in a discoteque, but it definetly is one of the worst albums I've ever heard considering homeplay. The only piece of melody that glued into my brain was  the chorus of &quot;Let Forever Be&quot;, which - surprise surprise! - was  originally written by The Beatles! Ok, sure, there is something cachy about  the simple yadding of 2Hey Boy, Hey Girl&quot;, but it just ain't good  enough! The rest of the album made me feel like I was listening to a  repeated lines form the icecreamtruck's music...
6300215954|5.0|Howard Hawks must be considered a pioneer in what nowadays is called &quot;ecological movement&quot;. In 1962 he produced and directed a wonderful movie with all the necessary sketchs of a comedy. John Wayne  always as John Wayne:you watch the movie and you believe in what you're  seeing. That's his secret. The photography is one of the best in the  history of cinema. The music excellent.Wild animals running in the sabana  and the trappers just running over them with a jeep and an old truck in  order to catch them without shooting a single bullet. That's why is in my  opinion the first ecological movie.
6305922748|4.0|well, as we move to the new millenium, even the most die-hard 80's metal fans have to admit that the whole decade's phenomenon was simply ridiculous. I mean, if Bon Jovi sells 10 million... Well, talking about  self-irony, this movie was made at the time the phenomenon started to get  big, and it just features all the cliches of the time. Nice work, and a  damn funny film! Oh,and remember: in ten years, everyone will be laughing  at these Korn-copies, and Fred Durst will be the new Vanilla ice!

B000002H33|5.0|This CD Rocks! This is the band at their best. The raw intensity was never fully revealed on any other Metallica Albums like this one. With classic tracks Like BATTERY, LEPPER MESSIAH,AND THE EXPLOSIVE ANTHEM MASTER OF  PUPPETS. This is when Metallica were still not popular but they had  something most bands dont have today the abillty to still deliver the good  tunes without ever losing their edge. 14 years later after Master Of  Puppets was released the band is still around bashing out the hits, they  are sensational group who are true to their way of hard rock, I am still a  die had fan of theirs and always will be. This band never cared if they  were popular or radio faverites they just love their music and that`s what  makes them so unique.
B00003CWL5|5.0|There is something very special about the movie &quot;American Beauty&quot; Words can't quite capture the emotions and feelings that this movie stirs inside of you. The characters are so amazingly brought to life by the brilliant cast. Annette Benning was completely [cheated] out of the  Oscar for best actress this year! And Kevin Spacey was totally deserving of  his Best Actor win! If you think a drama can't be funny, and if you think  that a comedy can't make you laugh, you have obviously not seen the most  brilliant movie of all time &quot; American Beauty &quot;
6304106017|3.0|Viloent,bloody and often times very funny. Two wild Bank Robbers on the run from a massive killing spree head to Mexico to hook up with a man who will give them protection from the law. But things don`t go as planed, They  make an arrangment to meet at a local bar filled with exotic dancers but  the man who supposed to give them protection never shows and soon enough an  altercation with one of the locals brings out a horde of flesh eating  vampires for a night these two robbers will never forget. Far fetched story  but it kept me going on through the end. I really did enjoy the outlandish  performances of Clooney and Tarantino as the two bank robbing brothers on  the run. Harvey keital plays his part as the unwillingy hostage they  capture very convincley. If you like mindless fun with Bloody violence and  sharp foul mouthed humor you will love FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|What you see above is the onlyfunny one-liner in this terrible movie. Will smith can't act n'or rap so what's the big deal with this guy? Barry Sonnenfeld... well I never liked his movies because they were all sort of cheesy and without any substance at all. Bur with this one he has reached  the peak of stupidity. Let me think of something positive about this  movie... well the production design is pretty cool and Kenneth Branagh, who  plays the bad guy Dr. Loveless is the onla actor who convinced me. Kevin  Kline was probably in this movie to earn some money because you can't find  any compassion in his acting. If this movie should have been funny, it  failed! It's not even entertaining it is just &quot;loveless&quot; scenes  put together by random it seems and when Will Smith repeats the same joke 5  times it isn't funnier as if he would have said the line once. Salma  Hayek's role would [annoy] every feminist and when Will and Kevin dress as  women it is just more pathetic than funny. &quot;Wild Wild West performed  by Will Smith&quot; Why does that have to be in the opening credits?   Probably to sell some more CDs. stay away from this movie cause it's only  gonna make you angry and unsatisfyed.
0783216084|5.0|Let me get right to the point.  &quot;Jaws&quot; is a classic, a masterpiece, the standard by which all modern horror and action thrillers are measured.  Spielberg's 1975 adaptation of Peter Benchley's celebrated  novel may well have ignited a new era for the movie industry at that time:   the era of the &quot;Summer Blockbuster.&quot;  Sadly, it's an era that  seems more intent upon marketing commercial products and visual effects  over substance and innovation, as many of Hollywood's bigwigs (Spielberg  included) have sold out to produce brainless, demographically inspired  trash like &quot;Con Air,&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild West.&quot;  Remember  when going to the movies was fun?  Remember when you could expect a healthy  blend of crisp and original storytelling, attention to character  development, and a plot that didn't insult your intelligence?   &quot;Jaws&quot; manifests each of these essential ingredients to a quality  movie-going experience, and the result is one of the greatest films of all  time.<br />The residents of Amity Island, Massachusetts have one thing going  for their livelihoods: summer tourists and beach goers.  So what do you do  when a great white shark threatens to bring an untimely end to the summer  season, not to mention the lives of several unfortunate bathers?  This is  the dilemma that's brilliantly played out between the rational-minded  sheriff (Roy Scheider) and the politically motivated town mayor (Murray  Hamilton).  The quarrel is finished when a series of tragic events compel  that the shark be killed by any means necessary.  Enter the best  shark-hunting trio ever assembled.  Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert  Shaw formulate such perfect chemistry that we can't peel our attention away  for even a moment.  In fact, the movie's final hour may be one of the  finest ever filmed in terms of drama, suspense, and sheer horror.  All  performances are commendable, the dialogue at times is brilliant, and the  mechanical shark (Bruce) is as terrifying as any &quot;computer  generated&quot; effect from that moronic film &quot;Deep Blue Sea.&quot;   John William's score ranks among the best ever composed, on a par in terms  of ground-breaking significance with the themes from &quot;Star Wars,&quot;  &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and &quot;West Side Story.&quot;  The movie  was followed by three sequels, each increasing exponentially in banality.
079073804X|5.0|Well this is defenitly the most horrifiying motion picture there is. If you got a party at your house and everybody is just smalltalkin around and you can't take it no more, just put in the EXORCIST and after 5 Minutes  everybody will be quite with their eyes wide open....<br />I guess the biggest  effect is that an inonocent little girl is able to say such terrible things  when she is posessed by a demon.<br />The story is so believable and the  atmosphere is so convincing that it is impossible not to be frightend by  this movie.<br />Don't you dare watch this movie alone in the house on a  stormy evening cause you'll get real paranoia which proves the movie is  great.

0684874350|5.0|If Victor Hugo thought that Jean Valjean had cornered the market on misery, well then he never met Frank McCourt. I am forever indebted to my sister for recommending \\"Angel's Ashes.\\" This book has touched my soul. I was totally consumed by it, and I would go to bed at night weeping  for those poor kids. If only I could give them a taste of my watermelon, a  bite of my steak, a drink of my milkshake.....  Some people commented on  the book jacket that they couldn't understand how Frank could have risen  from that dismal life in Limerick to become so successful. Well, in spite  of all their shortcomings, it was obvious that the boys' parents gave them  love, and that will overcome many things. This was the greatest book I've  ever read.
0783225849|5.0|Seamless and classic suspense from the master of said field, Alfred   Hitchcock. Although he would go on to make a couple of better films, Psycho   remains his defining movie for many reasons, all of which are good. Mind  you,  you should be warned ahead of time that if you are not the type of  person who  has a good attentive skills and is easily distracted then you  are better off  watching some big budget summer flick, because Psycho is  not for those who  enjoy brainless modern Hollywood movies that are packed  with senseless gore or violence. Instead Psycho builds a steady and  nail-biting  suspense that results in the ultimate discovery of the true  nature of one man. What most have failed to understand about this film is  that it is more than  edge of your seat suspense, but also a study in human  nature and that is  perhaps where the true horror derives from.  Although  famous for its shower scene, don't expect a modern guts and  gorefest. By  no means is any gore truly elaborated upon, instead Hitchcock  structures  his classic on the creepy tale of Norman Bates. We are slowly and   effectively keyed into Bates' madness and that is when things are  terrifying  when we notice that this is a human and not a monster that  lurks in the  darkness.  The story quickly goes from urban to rural when  Janet Leigh's character steals a weighty amount of money from her employer  and heads out &quot;on the run&quot;. Along her trek she grows weary and  drops off in a lonesome hotel where she uncovers a childish and shy man  named Norman Bates. Slowly the viewer is presented to the sickening truth  behind the events that lead to Mrs. Leigh's character's death, along with  that of others. There is nothing creepier than seeing Norman give out his  lines or stand vigilante over his handiwork. This movie remains a gem  throughout the years, intelligent, eerie and brilliantly directed and shot.  The black and white, which most modern viewers find a turn off, is actually  a large contribution to the mood of the film, making it a piece of  &quot;dark-underbelly Americana&quot;. Truly classic and a must for your  dvd/vhs collection. The dvd edition provides further insight into the movie  and an excellent presentation of the film, supreme and worthwhile purchase.
B000002MUQ|5.0|I must confess from the onset that I grew up in the 80's mega band/metal era and VH is my all-time favorite band.  Therefore it's not surprising that I have all of thier albums and could never guess how many times I have  listened to them.  <br />Having said that, I listened to this album at least a  dozen times before throwing my 2 cents in here and can honestly say that  this is as good as any album Van Halen has ever recorded.  <br />As Boston  said in trying to describe their first release, &quot;Listen to the  record.&quot;  This album is a must for all real rockers!
B00000I8NC|5.0|It's almost fitting that Godspeed You Black Emperor! should adorn their second record, Slow Riot For New Zero Kanada, with a sketch of an incendiary device. The record opens with the touchwood that is the  reverberant guitars and strings at the beginning of Moya and builds, via  their kindling and fuelled by the benzene of hopelessness and paranoia, to  a mighty rage.<br />There's precious little music that I find to be as  awe-inspiring as this. It's sad, apocalyptic and overwhelmingly cathartic  and, when played loud, can make me forget everything else.
0790729989|4.0|This isn't going to have a happy ending.<br />Tough thriller with an incredible climax. Exceptionally written, and well-acted thriller but not for the timid. 7 is very unsettling and dark at times. The Plot:  Police drama about two cops (Freeman and Pitt), one new and one about to retire,  after a serial killer using the seven deadly sins as his MO. <br />Favorite  line: Detective David Mills (Pitt): I've been trying to figure something in  my head, and maybe you can  help me out, yeah? When a person is insane, as  you clearly are, do you know that you're insane? Maybe you're just sitting  around, reading &quot;Guns ammo ...Wow! It is amazing how crazy I really  am!&quot;? Yeah. Do you guys do that?<br />The DVD:  Outstanding  image  quality.  Shadowy and intentionally dark; images are sharp and detailed.  The Dolby® Digital soundtrack delivers excellent sound.

B00004SCX6|5.0|When  first bought this CD, I was a bit skeptical, since I thought the first single (OOPS I Did it again), was ok but not great. After I got past the first song, I was surprised to hear some pretty inspriational girl  power songs such as stronger. Brittney can belt out the tunes even better  than on Baby One more Time, and also manages to deliver some pretty cool  songs about likeing who you are and not changing yourself for anyone.  Despite a couple of slow love songs (which I usually hate, but can manage  to listen to because MISS. Spears sings them w/ such style.) I really  enjoyed listening to this  and will certainly put it in my CD player  &quot;One More Time&quot;.

0783241038|5.0|How could anyone not love this movie? What's not to love? I was skeptical at first about seeing this, as I am not a big sci-fi, Trek, or Tim Allen fan, but then I read several reviews that I trusted and decided what the  heck. One said it was &quot;critic proof&quot; and they were right! Someone  else compared it to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (as far as people's reactions  to it, and sort of the genre) and I agree with that too...as I said, all I  know about Star Trek I read in some Harlan Ellison books and Nichelle  Nichol's autobiography.  I never really was a fan of this show-didn't hate  it, but not my thing. And I still absolutely loved this movie! 1,000 words  are not enough for me to tell you all the great things about Galaxy  Quest-you have to see it for yourself. I can only imagine how much a fan of  the show would have loved it-and would get all the in jokes (I got some,  but I'm sure I missed plenty). I have more respect for Allen now as a  performer, he did a great job (and a great Shatner!).  Sigourney Weaver  looked gorgeous, the best I've ever seen her look in fact. I especially  respect a movie that casts a female love interest opposite the lead male  WHO IS ACTUALLY THE SAME AGE AS HIM. In fact, instead of being 20+ years  younger as the norm is, I think at 52 she's even OLDER than he is. Good for  them! Too bad that's so rare these days. Another nice feature is there's no  swearing worse than you would hear on prime-time TV in the film, but it's  still funny as hell. Alan Rickman was great, as the classically trainer  Actor who will puke if he has to say his trademark line (&quot;by  Grabthar's Hammer...&quot;) one more time. I knew there would be a moment  where he would voluntarily say it, and mean it, and I was right. The moment  when Rickman utters it, meaning every word for the first time in his life,  will make you cheer (and also get a little choked up). If you've ever been  lovingly, obsessively devoted to any TV show, (I have) like the fans in the  movie are, then this movie will definitely strike a chord with you. You'll  know just how the fans feel when they can easily bring up trivia that even  the actors on the show don't know or have forgotten, or when Allen's  character needs a fan-boy's help and tells him &quot;It's all real!&quot;,  and the fanboy's reaction-well-I'm starting to sound like Harry Knowles  here, but the kid's ecstatic reaction made the audience I saw the film with  go nuts and really hit home with me. By the way, the audience, which  included more adults than kids, actually stood up and clapped when the  movie was over-haven't seen that for a while! If you're a Trekkie-uh, I  mean Trekker- don't worry about this movie jeering at or making fun of you.  It treats the fans with humor but lovingly and with respect. It's not  super-deep, it doesn't have an Important Message other than the obvious  ones (work as a team, help out your friends, and of course &quot;Never give  up...Never Surrender!&quot;), it's probably not something that will be  nominated for an award (too bad). But it's great, hilarious, fun  entertainment for pretty much any and all. If you want to  &quot;escape&quot; for 90 minutes or so this is the movie for you, one of  those movies that transports you and is so entertaining that you get so  caught up you forget about everything else other than the flick. You can't  go wrong- take my word for it.in the  movie are, then this movie will definitely strike a chord with you.

6304806434|5.0|At first, I thought Nicolas Cage was doing a very bad acting job.  As I watched, though, and began to understand his character, I realized it was a great acting job.  It wasn't bad acting...it was him portraying an  Alabamian with no higher education.  His education has come from life and  the military.<br />John Malkovich as Cyrus Grissom was unbelieavably good.  He  plays the psychotic villain to a T.  Ving Rhames, John Cusack, and Steve  Buscemi also play brilliant parts.<br />As usual for a Bruckheimer movie, the  action was over the top.  With most of the action taking place inside of  the airplane, it was pretty intense.  The chase scene on the fire truck at  the end was hella cool, too!<br />If you just want adrenalin pumping, good  guys always win action, this movie is for you.  If you're looking for high  art filmmaking, best go elsewhere.
B00004RGUU|5.0|George Roy Hill made a lean, stunningly original, gigantically entertaining movie back in the late 60s with this pop Western.  The screenplay, for starters, is one of those rare creations that is spare,  full of wit, and surprising at every turn.  Even today, the movie's  never-ending series of classic moments feel fresh and contemporary,  including the titillating presence of Katherine Ross as Sundance's woman,  who also loves Butch...? Robert Redford became the superstar he is today  via this role, which showcases his subtle humor, his outrageous  handsomeness, and his star quality.  Paul Newman has never been as  appealing; his combination of fear and guts is electric.  The musical  score, Burt Bacharach's best for the movies, combines several haunting  melancholy themes with the irresistable pop of Raindrops Keep Fallin On My  Head, which underscores one of the most pleasurable moments in the film.   Still, this movie does not shy away from the negative qualities of its  three anti-heroes; though the finale is double-edged (we love these guys,  after all), it is not a movie about how glamorous it is to be a bank robber  in the Wild Wild West.  Intelligent, compelling and most of all vastly  entertaining, this movie deserves to be seen by anyone who loves the  movies.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I debated whether I wanted to buy or rent this movie, but I am very glad I bought it, because I will show it to everyone  know.  I'm glad this bold movie was made, and Edward Norton and Bratt Pitt are excellent.  This is  not a movie you can just see once.

B00000K19E|4.0|this is a very cool movie, fun to watch and i love keanu reeves. i also love sci-fi flicks so why did i give the matrix only 4 stars? the plot was stupid and lacking just about everything. not fulfilling in the way of a  story at all. but dispite all this the special effects are the best i've  ever seen and the matrix remains on my amazon.com wish list.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Unlike &quot;Dive&quot;, which drowns in silly lyrics, this album has everything a lover of Brightman's angelic voice could want.  Her interpretation of &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; deserves placement next  to Dion's, her rendering of my old Kansas favorite &quot;Dust in the  Wind&quot; is remarkable, and the Enya-esque track &quot;Scene  D'Amour&quot; is simply one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.   None of the other 13 songs disappoint, either.  Buy it and play it on a  rainy day to brighten your mood, or, even better, in a candlelit bedroom.
B00004TDTO|5.0|My first encounter with Jaws was back in 1978 when I saw Jaws 2 as a 7  year old. A year or two later I got to see the original Jaws when it was  re-released during the summer. I was genuinely enthralled by this landmark  classic as a kid and to this day Jaws hasn't lost any of its bite!<br />It's  simply amazing what Steven Spielberg pulled off despite the legendary  problems that was faced throughout the production of the film.  This  adventure/horror story based on Peter Benchley's original novel, is  exciting, terrifying and even funny. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the  late Robert Shaw made a unlikely but highly memorable team as they went  about hunting down a 25 ft 3 ton Great White Shark named Bruce. Jaws is  filled with memorable images and scenes from the opening credits to the  very end. One that always stands out to me is watching the Orca set sail  through a  set of shark jaws hanging over a window in Quint's studio.<br />A  combination of skilled direction and editing, terrific acting, and a highly  charged and unforgettable music score by John Williams create of the  greatest films of all times.  This upcoming DVD looks to be the definative  edition to watch this groundbreaking film for many many years to come.   Jaws still delivers the goods 25 years later.

0312853238|5.0|This book was very, very, very good in my opinion.  One of the author's finest works; it delves deep into the soul, reality, truth, and the human mind.  Definitly a 5-star rating!
B00000ILBK|5.0|A lot of people don't like this movie, you have to appreciate the movie on the level its aimed at. Its not meant to be an all out action sci-fi like the previous movie &quot;first Contact&quot;. This has an original  storyline, very clever which I may add, its hard not to repeat an episode  of any of the star treks considering how many have been made! The movie  does have its share of action, but you also must appreciate the story  itself, whether your a treky or not. The DVD could have more special  features, but generally paramount DVD's tend to go for the basic DVD,  movie, trailer and some times the directors commentary or behind the  scenes. Taking nothing away from the superb picture quality and superb  dolby digital 5.1 sound, the DVD is a must have for your collection.
B00004TH6O|4.0|I think the new QOTSA record is beautiful.  In this era of industry created fads, bands, and rapcore redneck ensembles this album stands alone as the saviour.  josh homme and nick oliveri have dominated another sound.   kyuss was a masterful band that blew me away.  but the Queens blow me away  in a totally different way.  Think of them as Kyuss light mixed in with  some nice experimentation.  Kyuss pushed it all to the limit...throttling  down a deserted strip of the desert...&quot;R&quot; is the morning after  the party hangover helper.  superstonerockliveson-metamorphasized.

It has some good comedy and a lot of  action.<br />I was suprised a how much I liked it because being a teen, alot  of PG &quot;Space Movies&quot; are not that good.<br />As for the DVD,I  thought it could of used a little more features,such as that Mockumentry  that I saw on the USA channel. The reason it was important was because it  was I believe over an hour long.{If it was on there,I am Sorry.} I really  suggest it.<br />See Ya<br />*Their show &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is to their  people our &quot;Star Trek&quot;.*

0783235607|5.0|Don't let the viewer from New Zealand fool you. PSYCHO is a great horror  classic that can never be surpassed and has influenced thousands of movies,  many of them awful. HALLOWEEN has been one of the best to come out of these  imitations. And by the way, to New Zealand, the trouble with America today  is that we have been desensitized by the slasher movie industry, so that  when we see a truly frightening horror film, it usually doesn't impact us.  I know that nowadays PSYCHO seems outdated, but it should be appreciated  for what it did 40 years ago to moviegoers worldwide.

6305308659|5.0|I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from PLEASANTVILLE the first time I saw it. Many like myself expected to see another blast back to the past in the style of Back to the Future and Peggy Sue Got Married. Because of these  assumations, PLEASANTVILLE turned into an enlightening experience for me, a  surprise that stretched my brain and warmed my heart. This is much more  than your average time-travel spectacle, but rather a film that has a lot  to say and a wonderful way of expressing it.   Toby Maguire (seen most  recently in &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;) and Reese Witherspoon star  as two typical squabbling teenage siblings in the nineties, both wanting to  have use of the television at the same time. In their quarrel for the  remote, the clicker shatters against the wall and what do you know, Don  Knotts comes to their rescue. He hands them a magic remote control that  zaps them into the wonderful world of Pleasantville, a fifties-style family  sitcom world that just happens to be Maguire's favorite show. They enter  the picture (literally) as the two teenagers in the story, living in a  perfect home and an ideal family.   Of course, what ensues is an  examination of how preposterous and unrealistic this television world was.  Pleasantville is a little town where your breakfast resembles a die-hard  cholesterol diet and every shot at the school basketball hoop automatically  goes in. Anything beyond holding hands is considered sexually risque, and  even parents look like they never even heard of 'doing the nasty,' even  though they are always mighty chipper in the morning. This is a fun social  commentary that is unafraid to poke at this culture with a heated cattle  prod. Credit has to be given to the actors who play the real Pleasantville  community; their naivety seems authentic and not overly forced.  This cast  of characters plays their parts so well and so effortlessly. Joan Allen is  my favorite performance in the film, playing a mother who is alwaysready  with the meals and there to greet her husband (William H. Macy) when he  comes home from work, but deep down inside yearns for something different  and outside of routine. The scene where she first shows her 'true colors'  is nothing but priceless. I also liked Jeff Daniels as the soda fountain  manager and J.T. Walsh (in one of his last performances) as the mayor of  the town. What is truly fascinating about each of these characters is they  all resemble typical fifties archetypes but at the same time create  completely original people, influenced by a society that must remain  &quot;pleasant.&quot;  While the audience is enjoying this mockery of  small-town life, PLEASANTVILLE takes a sharp turn in its narrative by  looking into how societies such as these were destroyed by controversy. New  ideas and new expressions of emotion through art or physical contact bring  destruction to the serenity of this universe. We see haunting revelations  of how the Nazi party perhaps became fueled with rage over any kind of  written prose, or how segregation can bring hatred and prejudice to a  society that once thought itself as equal. The story brings to light the  frivolous nature of many of these disputes, not to mention how contrived  our legal system is and how our opinions are shaped. I am a past student of  American history (from a Canadian university), and after watching these  sequences from the film, my understanding of these issues took on a whole  new meaning. It is indeed admirable that PLEASANTVILLE does not flinch from  the messages it tries to convey, no matter how radical they may be  perceived.  I won't reveal the ending of PLEASANTVILLE in case anyone has  not yet seen this wonder of a movie. All I will say is it is not a  one-sided one. The film does reach into the political grab-bag and presents  its own theories, but also does not go beyond the human nature of its  story. The reality of this world may be hidden by a comforting and  deceptive facade, but underneath it, human feeling is reaching out and  longing to express itself in a unique way. PLEASANTVILLE does not dare to  presume that any of these two societies (the 50's or the 90's) were better  and happier eras in history, but allows us to realize these experiences for  ourselves without being too skeptical. Only once we look at society with an  open mind and an open heart can we live in harmony and difference without  turmoil. We are all special and original, but that's okay. A simple  message, but evidently not that easy since our society has not yet grasped  it.
0553278223|5.0|Bradbury's 'The Martian Chronicles' subjects a reader to an entirely different series of stories.  The collection of stories is more of an account of various observations and reflections about Mars and man.  The  stories all tie together in one sense as they are about Mars, but each  paints an entirely different viewpoint about the planet from the  perspective of the people who go there or reside there.  All the stories  are good, and unique unto themselves.  I found this book to be quite  remarkable.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Of all the DVD video's I have purchased, I am most pleased whith  Whitney's! This is money well spent - the videos alone are more than 90  minutes - the length of a movie! Then there's all the DVD extra's! My only  only disappointment is in the fact the videos from her latest CD caught me  quite by surprise - I expected the fantastic dance versions of the songs I  hear in the clubs, and was very disappointed to find they were all SLOW  versions - after a few listens they began to grow on me.  All we need now  are those WONDERFUL dance mixes on DVD and this set would be perfect!

It certainly won't  stop them, thank goodness... and we have to remember why Grunge become  popular in the first place-- IT SOUNDS GOOD- solid, brooding, sexy... and  Creed gives it a healthy twist in the right direction, upwards;  the style  obviously inspired them--not a mystery. A little blaphemous perhaps? who  knows...? they put MY mind in the right place... The whole CD is amazing--  Are You Ready is excellent in the role of leading track with great punch  appeal-- but I can't forget to mention the current hot singles, Arms Wide  Open with Mark saturating that pause with his guitar at just the right  moment, and Higher, which just makes me want to fly-- it soars, dips and  twirls... powerful. Sure, toss in some Stone Temple Pilots influences too--  whatever! It works.<br />Don't stop guys. Don't ever forget what is propelling  you ... Having been very pleased by the debut &amp; current, I'm looking  forward to your 3rd effort, and I hope I have the opportunity to say Thank  You again.
0767849493|5.0|Alanis is god that is a new one. The 13th apostole is a rightous black man, and the angels of death and his buddy quit and were banished to Michigan. How can you go wrong with this movie? It was the funniest movie  that I have seen in at least a year. If Jay and Silent Bob are our last  hope then the world is in deep &quot;weed&quot;. This is a must see movie,  and I will own a copy of it to complete the 4-parter. SEE THIS MOVIE!
B000001Y2U|5.0|From the chant of &quot;We hate love, we love hate,&quot; to the distorted, demonic guitars that fade out as the finale, &quot;AntiChrist Superstar&quot; is an album of agression, frustration and pity towards the  problems surrounding the world in which we live. Each song offers so much  to the listener - one minute, you'll hum along to tracks like &quot;The  Beautiful People,&quot; play air guitar to &quot;Irresponsible Hate  Anthem,&quot; and headbang like a man possessed to &quot;The Reflecting  God.&quot; Some may pass this album off as just another poor attempt at  befriending the devil, but look deeper and listen harder, and you'll soon  realise that listening to &quot;AntiChrist Superstar&quot; is like trying  to make decent conversation with inner demons. On speed. That, I guess,  would be fairly mad and crazy, but very entertaining indeed.
6302517036|5.0|One of the best vampire movies I have ever seen with LOST BOYS being number 2. Next to RADU( SUBSPECIES) Vampire Jerry Dandrige(Chris Sarandon) is one very bad Vamprie,Roddy McDowell is perfect as PETER VINCENT:FEARLESS  VAMPIRE KILLER, and William Ragsdale as Charlie Brewster (the stubborn  teenager who tries to tell everyone about the Vampire who lives next-door  and no one believes), and Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed, plus Amanda BEARSE(  T.V's Married with Children) as Charlie Brewster's girlfriend.(can you  believe it I forgot her character's name, and I just watched this movie  again about 2 days ago). This movie has it all good acting great effects,  directing was great and it was scary. I highly recommened this movie.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I wasn't sure that Eminem could outclass he's previous cd with he's new release. Then as public opinion came forward the one and most obvious complaint was that it wasnt as good as the first and nowhere near as original. So in fear i went with my friend to buy the cd, hoping that it  would at the least be decent. By the end of the Cd i found myself laughing  hysterically and rather enjoying myself with he's lyrically genious. He  went off on all he's enemies, namely ICP and DMX thought some insults were  more obiouvs then others, but what really took this Cd to a new Level was  the comey factor. As many may know by now, Eminem isnt as crazy as he  portray's himself to be, but he will say whatever sells, as is the case  with Dr. Dre who's admitted it himself on many occasions. There were so  many good tracks i found myself having trouble deciding what to litsen to  next. Either way in my humble opinion id have to say it was better then  he's first release. He's had to climb through the media, personnal problems  and a whole slew of drugs situations, but were many have failed he has  suceeded.
B00003CX6P|3.0|Evidence of the Oscar-winning talent that constitutes director Anthony \\"The English Patient\\" Minghella's crew is splattered all over this sumptuous film. Once again, Minghella, aided immensely by his director of  photography, John Seale, showcases his gift for cinematically recreating  specific times and places with a painstaking exactitude of detail and an  unparalleled richness. As we follow Tom Ripley (played by an almost  emaciated Matt Damon) from his humdrum New York existence to the golden  beaches of 1950's Italy, we easily allow ourselves to be lost in  Minghella's stunning world of bronzed and beautiful Italian natives and the  fair-skinned American trust-fund-babies that saunter about their shores.  Minghella makes it very easy for us to understand how and why a young man  like Tom Ripley, who comes from a thankless blue-collar background, could  allow himself to be seduced by the idle ways of these idle rich. And,  indeed, it is during the first hour of The Talented Mr. Ripley that the  film is on its most sure footing. It is during this time that we are  introduced to a fascinating array of characters, ranging from the charming  and gorgeous Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), to his beautiful blonde-haired  socialite girlfriend Marge Sherwood, to the adorably aloof Meredith Logue  (Cate Blanchett), and, of course, to the spoiled and obnoxious Freddie  Miles (a minor role played deliciously by the excellent-as-usual Philip  Seymour Hoffman).<br />However, this film's fatal flaw is that it suddenly  shifts gears at the halfway point, and the story just as quickly loses  confidence in where it is supposed to go next. Indeed, it almost seems as  if Minghella devoted so much attention to setting up this incredible world  with its incredible characters that he had little energy left to devote to  the crux of Patricia Highsmith's novel, which concerns a poor young  outsider who violently subverts the well-to-do world that he discovers he  can never truly be a part of; but he does all of this (and this is  important, for it is where Minghella's interpretation fails) out of an  envious fury that the audience is supposed to be able to relate to, a fury  spawned by the deeper ills that come from class division and prejudice. In  other words, the audience is supposed to delight in Ripley's brutal  killings, even if we are simultaneously appalled by them. We are supposed  to be able to root for Tom Ripley, the underdog, much as we find ourselves  oddly rooting for the Patrick Bateman character in Mary Harron's American  Psycho precisely because we understand his fury at being stuck in the  uniquely American web of shallow consumerism, commercial brainwashing, and  material greed. Instead of developing Tom Ripley in a way that will allow  his modern audience to relate to his rash actions, Minghella makes the  mistake of trying to cater to a contemporary sensibility by making explicit  Ripley's homosexuality, which was only hinted at in Highsmith's novel.  Thus, much of the fascination with the character of Tom Ripley in the book  is lost in the movie, and we often find ourselves laughing at this pathetic  wretch with his silly lustful infatuation than sympathizing with  him.<br />Even on a structural level, the film's second half fails. Once  Ripley commits his first and most important murder, the languid but  alluring pace of the first half of the film suddenly gives way to a  dizzying flurry of jumbled events, with Ripley stumbling upon one sloppy  murder after another until the very end, when Minghella basically just cuts  the film short and decides to end it. Even those that greatly admire this  film must acknowledge the abruptness of its conclusion, which is meant to  be profound -- with Tom Ripley sitting alone, fresh off of another kill,  his fractured reflection bouncing off of a mirror and revealing his cracked  and empty soul -- but is really just a fancy end to a very sudden chain of  events that leaves the audience reeling and, ultimately,  unimpressed.<br />Still, Minghella's latest film is very much worth watching  if just as a showcase for his superb ability to transport his audience to  an intricately, lovingly fabricated world. And that alone is a commendable  achievement by any filmmaker.
B00004SCX6|1.0|My little sister bought this album as soon as it came out and I have always tried to give her music  a chance but I simply cannot.  All her songs are just remakes of baby one more time.  Some of these  songs sound exactly like Nsync or Backstreet Boys songs.  There is not one ounce of  originality on this album and the fact that she does not know how to sing  does not help a lot.  On this album she tries too hard to try to sound like  Christina Aguilera. Britney needs to find herself a vocal coach, new  songwriter and producer.  But it will not make a difference because she  does not have enough talent to last.
0375703764|5.0|Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves is one of the single most brilliant works of fiction/psychology i have ever had the good fortune to discover. It can equally be called House of Echoes/ Memories/ Fears and Motives, and  like christ's father's house, it has many rooms.  i think the leaves also  refer to layers of your own personal sub/unconscious and (like the original  idea behind mantras, mandalas, and maybe religious architecture in  general), the book presents a medium to plumb those personal depths.  perhaps (one of) the points is that each of us, like the house, is bigger  (and deeper, scarier, darker and more unpredictable) on the inside than on  the outside.  the structure of the narrative creates so many resonances  it's like 2 mirrors facing each other reflecting each other's reflection  forever.  but it's not even the book's narrative, but the journey it sets  you on, that is the goal. i also think it is an exceptional piece of  self-criticism, epistemological doubt, and satire about the limits,  absurdity, and inescapability of over-intellectualizing the world (by a  brilliant mind parodying itself). experience it.
B000009QPE|5.0|Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; shows everybody why they are the greatest metal band there ever was. This is their best work (with &quot;Hell Awaits&quot; as a close second), and features such popular  Slayer anthems as &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, &quot;Jesus Saves&quot; and of  course, &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Don't dare call yourself a fan of metal  if you don't own this CD.
B000002BQK|4.0|I used to listen to this CD a lot, especially Honey and Breakdown. I got this about as soon as it came out. I found it very pleasurable. The best songs are Honey, The Roof, Fourth of July, Breakdown, and Fly Away. Some of  the songs are too long at times, though. I recommend it.
0767824571|2.0|This movie is NOT FUNNY! Some of the humor is childish, some of the humor is just stupid, and the rest of it is very, very disgusting. The scenes involving body limbs being cut off for any reason almost had me puke right  in front of the TV. And the blood that comes from the aftermath is so  obviously fake, but it comes in very disturbing gushes. It's outrageous to  believe this movie was rated PG. But the reason I gave it 2 stars is that  there were only a FEW moments that made me chuckle, including the opening  credit subtitle gag, the &quot;Trojans&quot; scene, and the annoying man  who sings constantly alongside Robin Hood, but doesn't know he's being a  pain in the butt. <br />So, in other words, don't see this movie if very  disgusting humor is not your cup of tea. But if you've been watching Beavis  And Butthead since the day you were born, you might like it.
0060194995|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. From the first sentence, I am pulled into a different world. The language is like poetry and the story is compelling. I love the movie, too.
630587493X|4.0|`Bicentennial Man' is a Sci-Fi comedy that turns into a Sci-Fi romance and then shoots for deep philosophical drama on death and dying.  It overreaches its capabilities and can't pull it all together.  It seems that  the more human Andrew became, the worse the film got.<br />This is based on  Isaac Asimov's short story about a robot named Andrew (Robin Williams)  whose flawed programming makes him obsessed with becoming human.  It shows  his relationship with four generations of the Martin family and his various  upgrades toward humanhood.  The first part of the film is engaging and  droll.  Williams is at his best when he is doing offbeat comedy, and this  segment had a warm kind of comedy that was enchanting.<br />By the time the  film progressed to the romance between Andrew and Portia, it had used up  its charm.  It became contrived and implausible.  Williams is beyond his  talents as a romantic lead and all the romantic scenes were forced and  awkward.  As the film moved towards the ending, Andrew wasn't the only  thing getting moribund.  The entire film began to decay.<br />Director Chris  Columbus did some excellent work in the area of makeup.  The robot costumes  and the aging makeup was wonderfully done.  Unfortunately, much was lacking  in the costumes and sets as the decades went by.  As time passed, nothing  seemed to change as regards dress and sets.  We are led to believe that 200  years hence, everything will look pretty much the way it looks today.   Think of the difference between dress in 1800 and today.  Shouldn't we  expect changes of similar magnitude over the next 200 years?  Apparently  not in Columbus' mind.  The only indications that it wasn't the 20th  century were a couple of futuristic blue screen city backdrops and that's  about it.  Very unimaginative.<br />Sam Neill was marvelous as the Martin  patriarch.  He gave the father wisdom, character and a strong guiding hand.   Embeth Davidtz was lovely but a little tentative at times as Portia.  She  was stronger as Little Miss, which required more warmth than dynamism.   Williams was very good at the start, but as the water got deeper, he  floundered.  He needs to stay with wacky comedy roles and stop pretending  he is a dramatic/romantic lead.  Oliver Platt was great fun as the eccentic  inventor who develops Andrew's upgrades.<br />There was a lot to enjoy about  this film. It was delightfully warm and schmaltzy even though it did  outlive its allure by the end. If you are the sentimental type, you will  probably enjoy it. If you are expecting side splitting comedy or good  Sci-Fi, forget it. I rate it a 7/10.
B000002Q88|3.0|This album would have been better had songs like 'One Man', and 'Inside of Me', been left off. I thought this CD had some of their best songs, 'Ghosts', 'Rainmaker', and 'Preacherman'. There was just a little too much  of an outside writing influence with the songs listed previously, that it  is not rated higher in my mind. Would have liked more of the Walsh, Morse  songs. All in all, a very good album.
0060976624|4.0|My husband asked me to read this to provide him with my view on whether this novel would be an appropriate book to assign for an undergraduate class on political parties and interest groups.  When I finally got to it  in my (despairingly large) pile of &quot;must reads,&quot; I wearily  resigned myself to what a I thought would be unsubtle insider jokes and  hackneyed cynicism.  Much to my delight, I discovered that the writing was  absolutely brilliant -- tight, funny, sophisticated, and original.  While  the characters, both the neo-puritans and the MOD squad, are Seinfeld-esque  in their nihilism and unlikability (even the ending does not redeeem our  protagonist -- And whatever happened to his first wife and child? They just  dropped right off the map!), the fast-moving plot and brilliant verbal  &quot;jujitsuing&quot; provide more than anough entertainment for the  reader.  Ultimately, I suggested that the book was perhaps too sexually  provocative for undergrads, but I heartily recommend it to adults.

B000001EAQ|5.0|Now, over 3 years after its release, I'm still baffled over the critical response to this album. While in no way trashed when it was first released, the collective critical reaction seemed to be a group shrug, admitting that  there were some good tracks, but as an overall album, not much to  recommend. I still remember the thrilling sense of vindication I felt, in  late '97, when in some year-end wrap up or another, various artists were  asked to comment on the music of the year, and no less than Elvis Costello  (no slouch in the songwriting department himself), declared  &quot;Please&quot; from POP as the best song written all year.  &quot;Please&quot; is a masterpiece of a song, serving as a thrilling and  musically daring penultimate declaration on a great album. From the subtly  jazz influenced drum work to the shifting, haunting bridge, it's an  impeccable piece. If its the best song on the album, it has serious  competition. &quot;Do You Feel Loved?&quot; is vintage U2, helicoptering  guitars and all, &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; is a poetic plea,  &quot;MOFO&quot; a blistering attack, a forest many couldn't see for the  techno trees layered on top, and &quot;Wake Up Dead Man&quot; is a sad and  bitter coda. I think many were turned away by the hints of techno here and  there, especially in the opener, &quot;Discotheque.&quot; If this is what  has kept you from the album, don't let it; the techno influence is much  smaller than it was made out to be. You don't have to dig too deep on this  album to hear that vintage U2.
B00000I8NC|2.0|I am very disappointed by this record.  It is incredibly boring!  It is a lot like Mogwai, but doesn't engage your attention.  The dynamics are blah.  The dialogue in the background seems to have been carelessly added.  Check  out Mogwai's &quot;Come on die young&quot; or &quot;Young Team&quot;  instead.
0064407667|1.0|The School Library Journal review for this book summed up most of what I might write.  Will Amazon feature it here?  These are slow-moving downers, self-consciously written and pretentious.  The gimmick of using big words  and then defining them got pretty stale, even for my fourth-grader.   Couldn't a big publisher devote the same amount of energy finding and  packaging an original book that will last?  Ursula would not be amused.   Adults can write for children.  Will anyone publish them?
B000002H70|5.0|'Disintegration' is an album of lost love, missed chances, and bitter reflections (sounds like The Cure to me). From the opening wind chimes of 'Plainsong', to the lonely organ in 'Untitled', Robert Smith and his band create a lush soundscape of layered keyboards and gentle guitar lines. 'Love Song' and 'Lullaby' are wonderful breaks from the slow tempos and lush atmosphere and are wonderful singles, they're also great on stage. 'Fascination Street' is the closest thing to a rock song on here, with a hard-edged bass groove and lyrics that are more decadent and sexual than any of the other songs. <br />'Disintegration' is a very consistent album (not as uniform in sound as 'Pornography') that holds up from start to finish its whole 72 minute duration. Depending on what you're looking for, it might take a couple of listens to sink in, and it does require a bit of patience.
0374172897|3.0|An interesting premise but the book doesn't live up to its ambitions. The characters remain opaque, and one is too conscious of the author being clever. Again and again one notes: &quot;oh yes, he's alluding to that bit  of the Woolf's Mrs Dalloway&quot; or &quot;ok, another item checked off:  having a character repeat language from Woolf's suicide note  verbatim.&quot; Although his writing is good, the end result is that  Cunningham seems pretentious to have attempted to speak for Woolf, catty,  and glib.
0790729687|5.0|Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt gave an excellent performance in Interview with a Vampire. They are two of the best actors of today, the way they expressed the emotions of this 5 star film gave me chills. I recommend that you own  this film and add it to the most wanted in the romatic/horror/drama films  of the '90s.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Ok, before I get too far into this review, let me mention that this is one of those movies that you are either going to love or hate.  Some people will love it because of its very black, sometimes cynical comedic style  while others will hate it because of its \\"supposed\\" glorification of  fighting and its farfetched concepts.  And this is the point of the movie,  to make you think rather than to make you love it.  That's what makes this  movie so great; there are no restrictions, no censorship, and no lies.  The  movies tells things in a way that is unrestricted, which makes everything  more vivid and more powerful than if it had been made around the  aspirations of the audience it wished to draw into the movie theater.  And  although people will certainly have their opinions, I believe that this  illustration of the freedom of movie making puts it right up there with  cult classics like Blade Runner and others.  <br />First off, the Script is a  thing of beauty.  Not only is it filled with very dark images all set in a  comedic tone, but it also illustrates perfectly the message that the movie  is trying to portray.  It also has that uniqueness to it that separates  Fight Club from all other previous movies.  It isn't just a rehashing of  old ideas but a unification of many radical ones in order to form an  original plot and idea, which translates into a genre-breaking film.  Fight  Club itself is part action, part black comedy, part mystery, part thriller,  and part insanity.  In this way it makes it difficult to compare to any  previous movie because it is so different from anything that I have seen or  that has been produced in the past.<br />The acting is also top notch.  Brad  Pitt is, out of all the characters, the one who holds the screen the best.   His role as Tyler Durdin, the strange yet sharp alter-ego friend Jack  (Norton), is one of strength, craziness, class, style, and intelligence, is  hard to miss and is a classic Pitt performance, similar in style to that of  his crazy portrayal of the inmate in 12 monkeys.  Although Norton does a  good job as Jack, the narrator, in the film, he doesn't have the same kind  of flare or presence that Pitt carries throughout the film.  And, at times,  he sound like the little kid who's always being pressured into doing the  `bad things' during recess hour.  Then there is Helena Bonham Carter, who  shines as the crazed and slightly neurotic love interest of Pitt and  Norton.  Although her presence in the movie isn't huge, her placement in  certain scenes is vital to the forward motion of the plot and the entire  movie in general.<br />Also, one reason to get the DVD rather than the VHS is  that you get tons of extra, for lack of a better word, stuff on the second  CD like behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes, audio commentaries,  storyboards, and more.  If you love to see the insides of a movie and find  out more about why the director or the producer or actors did certain  things then you'll love all these extras.  <br />All in all, regardless of  which one you buy, you will end up seeing a movie unlike any you have ever  seen...I guarantee it.  Director David Fincher's look at the underground  world is both slick and startling and anyone who calls him or herself a  movie buff has to give this movie a chance.  Even if you're reluctant to  let it grow on you, I promise that once you take the step to pop the movie  in your VCR or DVD player you won't be disappointed...I know I wasn't.  <br />RevuMan:  Ground control to Major Tom...sorry, could think of any relative  words of wisdom...oh well...Peace!
044022425X|5.0|After approx. 3600 pages of Gabaldon's books I am still yearning for more.  Drums of Autumn is yet another fantastic addition to this series.  This book is just as pleasing as the previous three, rich with imagery,  historically interesting, along with the comfortable presence of Claire and  Jamie that I have grown quite fond of throughout this series.  Gabaldon  continues to keep the story interesting by introducing new characters and  saying good-bye to some, creating new drama, but also bringing back and  reminding us of some characters from the previous books.  This leaves you  wanting more, knowing there is more to be told about all of these  characters and how their lives will weave into the web of Jamie and  Claire's.<br />The pace is a bit slower in this book (but by no means boring),  this helped me slow down a bit, enjoy the language(s), revel in the imagery  and prepare myself for the break I am now forced to take waiting for the  next installment of Jamie and Claire, Brianna and Roger.  I am left feeling  &quot;what will I read now?&quot;  <br />I highly recommend all of the books  in this series to everyone.  Gabaldon is a wonderful writer!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Let me tell you how I feel about Eminem. I think he's an extremely talented rapper and is at a par with Dre. I listened to most of the tracks on his album without buying it. It had some awesome beats and his lyrics  are incredibly witty. I don't think there is a rapper out there who can  write like him. I do however have a problem with some of his content. Some  of it is just a little to crazy for me. And you're talkin to a guy who  listens to DMX, Dre, George Carlin and Adam Sandler (comedians, if you  don't know). I usually have no problem with profanity. I have his first  album, and i really had no problem with that one. But, I think he went a  little over the edge with this one. I think it's great that he speaks his  mind. It's just that I'm not always interested on what's on his mind.
6305807086|5.0|I went in to this film not really knowing what I was going to see, I came out not really knowing what I had seen.  All I know is that this was one of the most original, artistic and maybe even one of the most beautiful films  that I have ever seen. From the moment the opening credits have finished  their duty, you are thrown into the  surreal world of Craig Shwartz an out  of work puppet master, shunned by a society who no longer appreciate his  forgotten art.  Money is tight and Craig is forced to find work beyond the  realms of puppetry, his skilfull hands make him the perfect candidate for a  postition as a filing clerk.  His new work place is located on the 7 1/2  floor of a tower building.  This is when surreal makes way for the outright  bizarre and the movie begins to reveal its real charm. <br />The 7 1/2 floor  is located between the 7th and 8th floor and is half the height of the  other floors. A  series of events (the finding of a door which leads in to  John Malkovich's mind is just one of many) follow which all culminate to  make wonderful entertainment which is way superior in intelligence to the  normal churn of Hollwood movies.  Don't get me wrong I am a great fan of  all types of movies and Art House style films aren't usually my kind'a  thing that is what is so surprising about this movie, it is there for  everybody to enjoy. It is non conformist, I can't decide what genre this  is, but maybe that is why it is so appealing.  It offers something so  different that everybody who sees it at least enjoys its uniqueness.<br />I  don't want to reveal too much about the film because not knowing only makes  this film better.  I will say though that the cast are brilliant. John  Cusack is outstanding in his role as Shwartz, and Cameron Diaz is hilarious  as his wife, believe me you have never seen Diaz like this before.   Catherine Keener plays Maxine, and is brilliant in the role of a vixen  seductress.  But the real hero here is Spike Jonze the director,he keeps  the film flowing and gives it continuity which must have been a very  complex task.  And, oh yes I also said that the film was beautiful, this  has largely to do with the use of some wonderful puppetry.  It is used on  various occasions to parody the emotions of Shwartz, and gives a better  understanding to what the film is trying to achieve.<br />The Dvd presentation  is somewhat dissapointing for a movie that begs so much more. Many of the  extras which it promises on the dvd sleeve are no more than highlights from  the film.  There is however a short, but insightful, interview with the man  behind the puppetry.  I hope that someday a more comprehensive release such  as a criterion edition will be released.  But for now we simply have to  make do with one of the most intriguing and involving films of our time.   Enjoy
B00004RFCM|5.0|I'd only caught 2 previous episodes before purchasing the DVD and find I can't stop watching it! Every time I sit down, I can't watch less than 3 episodes - just can't get enough! Every time I watch it, it's hilariously  funny! The girls look hot, and talk hot, but they really bring up real-life  dilemmas, say things I've actually said, and/or (sorry to say) heard before  (Skipper to Miranda &quot;I hope you find what you're looking for!&quot;) -  I can't say enough - it's hilarious! The occasional city views are  spectacular.
0152465030|5.0|Can't get enough of this book.  When faced with the prospect of having to buy -another- copy (I always give them away), I finally bought the hard cover.  The illustrations are incredible.  Spend the extra money just for them.  You miss so much by having to relate to the paperback, much smaller,  illustrations.<br />This is not a children's book.  The work is, in fact, far  too tragic for younger children, even if they don't grasp all of the  imagery presented in the story.  The ending is simply too difficult to try  to explain to small children.<br />But, aside from that...this book is so  beautiful.  It brings tears to my eyes every time I read it.  Each planet  may be a thinly disguised political lesson, but who cares.  The prince's  experiences are touching and at times heart-rending.<br />This book is also  best for reading out loud.  It'll take a little time, perhaps about an hour  and a half, but it's worth it.  The translation just rolls right off the  tongue, the images become much easier to picture, the dialogues between the  prince and the other character seem easier to internalize.<br />He may have  been writing a religious/spiritual statement, it may be a social-political  commentary, _The Little Prince_ may be an anti-science manifesto.  Point  is, it doesn't matter what the &quot;intent&quot; of the story was.  The  book is so accessible, so deftly written, the story so compelling and  honest, that any reader can intepret it in a deeply personal way.  Every  time you read the book, a different scene will leap out at you.  A  different line will strike your heart.  The fox, the rose, the tippler, the  prince, each character is fantastically vivid.  As you change in your life,  the book will change too.  It is a rare and treasured book, indeed.<br />A  note on the translation:  There is a new translation coming out, with  cleaned illustrations (which are brilliant).  While more  &quot;accurate&quot;, the language in the new version is not as soft, not  as texture-based.  The new translation seems to lack a lot of the  tenderness of the original translation; many of the greatest and most  memorable phrases come across as harder and less childlike.  Interesting to  read, but only a pale comparison to the first job.
0812932293|5.0|Quick read this book.<br />This book is nothing but fun and adventurous. Richard Branson was confirmed below average in school, but incredibly smart and creative in the real world. To often he has proven to the world that  nothing is impossible. Consistently stretching himself with near impossible  challenges has made this man thick and unbeatable in the bore-room.
630027120X|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with Tom Keogh's review of this movie. It is one of the most stirring and emotional epics I've seen in a long time. The performances are outstanding, the scenery is breathtaking and the music  wonderful. I am ordering this movie right now for my library. It reminds me  of the underrated &quot;To Play in the Fields of the Lord&quot;, however  were &quot;To Play&quot; treated the subject matter in a more cynical  fashion, questioning the often zealous nature of the missionaries,  &quot;the Mission&quot; truly inspires the belief in God and in the true  nature of these missionaries. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is a  great epic and deserved every nomination it received.

B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix -- the perfect masterpiece to celebrate the Digital Versitile Disc, or as most people call it, DVD. Crisp video makes the special effects more realistic than ever, and the sound is so clear, you can hear every  single word in sharp Dolby Digital sound. This puts other Sci-Fi DVDs to  shame. If you liked The Matrix on a movie screen, pop this into your home  theater to expirience fun extras, like commentary and behind-the-scenes  documentaries. Or slide this baby into your PC DVD-ROM drive for special  features, like trailers shown in movie theaters and a cool trivia challange  game. This is truly &quot;The One&quot; to own on DVD. If you didn't get  the joke in the previous sentence, buy this now, or you could take the blue  pill and never know how ignorant  about your life you were.
0553210246|5.0|This is truly a classic tragedy, and perhaps Hardy's very best. The opening is one of the most memorable I've ever read; Michael Henchard gets drunk and auctions off his family. The tale spins off from there, boldly  and without restraint. Though Hardy is a pessimist, he knows how to craft a  story of unforgettable characters inspired by all sorts of passions- some  taking whatever they can find for themselves, and some giving generously  and unconditionally. Wait until you meet and get to know Elizabeth; she is  a beautiful human being! I always learn so much from Hardy. I'm grateful  that he wrote the novels he did before turning exclusively to poetry. This  one in particular is so well done that I don't know how anyone can fail to  be impacted and changed by it.
0060194995|3.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a pretty good book, but not nearly as good as the movie.  The first half of the book jumped around too much and was simply a waste of about 130 pages.  However, I truly enjoyed the second half.   Atticus Finch is really an interesting character, and Bob Ewell is truly  dispicable.  TKAM is certainly worth reading, but don't expect too much.   It is definitely not what what I would call Pulitzer Prize-caliber.
6305426651|2.0|I am not doubting Roberto Benigni's talent for he certainly has talent.  What I do doubt is how good this film really is.  This is one of those films where at the end I was so depressed and it pretty much ruined what  was left of my day.  The film is set up as a romantic comedy that is just  so lavish and well done.  By the time the first half was up I felt like it  was the happiest film I had ever seen.  Then came the dreadful second half  which takes place in a Nazi death camp.  Sure there is some extremely dark  humor in this last half but it reaked of &quot;Shindler's List&quot; and  the conclusion is not exactly uplifting either.  I believe the film would  have been much better if it stuck to either the first half or the last  throughout the entire film and not setting up something wonderful and than  ending it with tragedy.  That's the worst joke anyone could pull and I for  one did not appreciate the film at all.
158234082X|2.0|So we know he is manaical.  How many stories about his drinking and drugging do we have to endure.  This book would have made a much better short story, very short.  It is not anything like what I expected.  So I  know he won't eat mussels in someone elses kitchen.  I was expecting an  &quot;expose&quot; on behind the scenes action.   Silly me, I wanted more  dirt on whether uneaten bread and chips go back in the basket for the next  customer, not page after page of the foul words used in his kitchen.  The  only thing I think I can say that's positive, is that I have a real  appreciation for the orchestration of the meals for a twelve-top.  Sorry, I  waited for this book for two weeks, and am amazed that I finished it.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem has words that ring true.  However, this album is missing a slight something that the Slim Shady LP had...  But, it's nothing detrimental, nor does it give any reason to slam this album.
079073804X|5.0|Wow!... want some chicken skin?  some cold sweat on your hands? then you must get The Exorcist!. No horror film has overpassed the effects of the Exorcist, must of all because its a true story. Even though the sound isnt  good enough for a home theater, it might be becuase the movie dates from  1973, and sourround sound wasnt invented yet. Putting aside the sound, the  movie itself is a classic.
0380730367|4.0|Good plot, excellent characterization, compelling prose. What more can you ask for? I have read each book in the series (except Sacred) but in my opinion this one is the best. The setup reminds me a bit of Chandler's  &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; with a PI stubbornly unwilling to betray some  unwritten loyalty towards his long gone client.<br />The remainder of the book  reminded me of &quot;Cape Fear&quot;. There are aspects of many good plots  molded into a seamless unity. The reading is easy and compelling. If you  like PI novels, you will like this one.
0671042858|3.0|I had just finished reading Insomnia, so I decided to read this book next because of its length. It started off pretty decently like King's books usually do, but I wasn't left with my usual smile at the end. It's not to  say the book was a complete flop, it's just that I have definitely read  better by him. I have never been lost in the woods so I do not know how  much of our basic survival instincts kick in in times of danger but I found  this book a little unbelievable at times. Trisha seemed awfully intelligent  for a nine year old girl, catching fish and just happening to know that  checkerberries and beechnuts were okay for her to eat and having the  strength to walk miles and miles daily for a week! Like I said, maybe this  is what really happens to people in times of distress, but it made the book  a bit less appealing. I did think the book was well written and very  discriptive, of course. It's also always enjoyable when King sticks real  people in his novels, like Tom Gordon and all of the other Red Sox players.  I do not think I could ever read a &quot;bad&quot; book by King, so I feel  I did not waste my time by reading it, it just is not my favorite!
6305137293|4.0|Great film. The ONLY bad thing is that Michael practically NEVER dies. Come on! The first was believable, though pretty agrivating, but this one was ridiculous. It's a burning tire, it's an axed burning tire, OH wait  that's Michael. And the ending with SANDMAN?
B00000JSYM|2.0|This is a nice CD for people who really like th Beach Boys. Still, some others may be disapointed by it since it is really different form songs such as Surfin'USA, Deuce Cup, etc...
1559409002|5.0|The merits of this film are obvious enough to simply summarize: it is the one and only original shoestring budget classic. No, the plot isn't original, but that hasn't stopped others from picking it up and running with it, sometimes in different directions, and sometimes even more  successfully (see &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; for a deeper, and darker,  take). But I doubt that ANYone ANYwhere has made a better film for less  money; as someone below wrote, &quot;&quot;Blair Witch&quot;, eat your  heart out.&quot;<br />And then to have it released on a Criterion DVD, well,  it just doesn't get any better than that! OK, we may not need TWO versions,  .... And the second DVD isn't just a filler: you get  anything and everything you could think of associated with the movie,  including &quot;now and then&quot; visits to the film sites, a great  hour-long tribute, a history of the film company, stills, probably more  than all but the most compulsive fan would want but you won't feel as  though you've gotten short-changed! As always, the real reason we love  Criterion is the quality of their prints - they are simply THE BEST you are  going to see. Anyone who has seen this film on one of its numerous cheapie  incarnations on VHS will be ecstatic with this version - you won't believe  how superior the picture quality is.<br />I have to say &quot;get this now,  before it's discontinued&quot;. This edition can NOT be bettered; you will  NEVER EVER see a better version of this classic sleeper.<br />Now, Criterion,  when are you going to release Robert Wise's &quot;The Haunting&quot;,  hmmmm?
0451160916|5.0|I have already reviewed this book six months ago, but I feel the need to say more about this brilliant masterpiece. &quot;The Shining&quot; was the first King book that I read. Since then I've read about ten more, on my way  to reading all of his books, and have found that this book was my far the  best one. The only one that came even close was &quot;Misery&quot;.  The  book takes place in Sidewinder Colorado (a break from the usual Maine  settings)in the heart of winter at the Overlook Hotel. Main character, Jack  Torrence is a writer and takes the job as a caretaker in order to get some  piece and quiet and work on the story he is composing. He takes his wife  and his son, Danny with him. It is at the Overlook that Danny discovers  that he has &quot;the shining&quot;, a special telepathic ability to see  things that will happen and to know what people are thinking. It turns out  that the piece and quiet that Jack wanted is far from what he gets... It is  an excellently written tale and the story line of cabin fever gone to an  extreme is brilliant. I felt as if I was actually in the hotel viewing  everything that was taking place. It is filled with hallucinations, ghosts,  and most of all, the wit and evil sarcasm of one of my favorite 'evil'  villians, Jack Torrence. There is absolutlely no way that you will not  enjoy this book. I even suggest watching the movie (after you read the  book) which is also excellent!
B00004TJFL|2.0|I don't think so...Though this one was pretty ok, it did not prepare us for it's AWFUL sequel, The Curse...I did not like this film at all. It lost pace half way through and what is with Michael's hair?
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica does some things on this album that sounded like pure, unadulterated abuse - of voice, instrument, and ears - back in '84, when this album was first released. Now it stands, to me anyway, as the greatest  thrash metal album ever. Yes, I know my Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, etc.,  and maybe it's mainly a case of &quot;my first is the best,&quot; but I've  never heard a thrash metal (or death metal) album that I like better than  this, and VERY few that I like even nearly as much. Metallica introduced  some bursts of &quot;thrash-to-come&quot; on &quot;Kill 'em All&quot; (my  second favorite Metallica album), but this is the album from which it  blasted forth in full, bass-heavy, staccato speed-riffing, fury.  &quot;Master&quot; seems to be considered by most to be their best album,  but this is the album that got everyone's attention,  blazing the way for  &quot;Master,&quot; and I think it's the more raw, concise  masterpiece.<br />My first exposure to this album was unique for me in that  after the first few listenings I was somewhat appalled by what I heard, yet  I couldn't get some of the motifs out of my head. I've never had an album  that I came to treasure, that took me so long to even acknowledge that I  liked it. &quot;The acoustic intro,&quot; by no means an original device on  heavy metal albums, was never more effective than it is here for the way  that it contrasts with the dingy drone of electric guitars that emerges  from beneath the well-mannered intro to launch the apocalyptic &quot;Fight  Fire With Fire.&quot; Then comes &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; which  gives a vivid impression of the hellish chaos of a battlefield, and is  still a concert staple (and worked remarkably well, backed by a symphony  orchestra, on S&amp;M, by the way). These two &quot;war songs&quot; are  perfect album openers for an album of diverse musical perspectives on  death.<br />I did not really like the frenetic pummelings of &quot;Ride the  Lightning&quot;&quot;Trapped Under Ice,&quot; or &quot;Creeping  Death,&quot; after the first several listenings, but over time they have  all become essential parts of what I now consider to be a near perfect  metal album - and &quot;Creeping Death&quot; eventually became one of my  five favorite Metallica songs.<br />Incidentally, &quot;Creeping Death,&quot;  whose style I used to think sounded a little out of place on this album,  wasn't originally part of this set: it was originally issued on an E.P.  called &quot;Jump in the Fire,&quot; which was issued the same year as  &quot;Kill 'em All,&quot; and also included the first appearances of the  covers, &quot;Am I Evil&quot; and &quot;Blitzkrieg,&quot; as well as  &quot;Jump in the Fire,&quot; and one other song from &quot;Kill 'em  All&quot; (it could have been &quot;Metal Militia&quot;). This E.P. is  somewhat of a rarity now, but it occasionally turns up in used CD stores,  if anyone is interested in looking out for it (it's pricey, though, usually  going for about $18 used). It is one of the best examples of how Metallica  has always tried to give their fans their money's worth, that they decided  to include &quot;Creeping Death&quot; on RTL, and this raging, masterfully  constructed song of vengeance also rounds out the vocal part of this album  perfectly.<br />I guess any review would be incomplete if it didn't mention  the prototypical Metallica ballad, &quot;Fade to Black,&quot; which is a  study in contrasts and a great example of the band's songwriting skills.  &quot;Call of Ktulu,&quot; is a really good, atmospheric, instrumental,  with some cool soloing and changes (the orchestra-backed version of this  song at the beginning of S&amp;M, by the way, is the highlight of that  album, sounding like good suspense-thriller movie score stuff). <br />No band,  let alone one with two guitarists, has ever changed tempos and rhythms more  crisply than Metallica, especially in the context of such good and  inventive songwriting. This oppressive collection of different musical  perspectives on death gave rise to thrash metal, and could also be called a  precursor of late 80's death metal. This is one of the top five heavy metal  albums  of all time, and one of the most influential, ground-breaking  albums of Rock-and-Roll, in general.
0790729725|3.0|I am not really a fan of the mob movies, but I have heard so much about 'GoodFellas' that I just had to rent it!  Joe Pesci's character was ugly!  He shot people for the fun of it and then laughed about it.  Everyone is  saying that 'GoodFellas' is the perfect crime story.  It is just how mafia  life is.  If that is the way mafia life is...it is the first I have heard  of it.  The end was what got this movie the three stars that it got.  (And  I was in a generous mood, when I gave this rating.)  If you are a fan of  these kind of movies...you'll love it. If you are just going to watch it  because everyone says it's good, you are making a mistake. The violence is  extreme.  The 'F' word is used in just about every other sentence.  When it  is all put together...IT MAKES YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH.
B00004T0UT|5.0|It doesn't get better than this. I have made Elvis fans of the otherwise indifferent using this album. Don't leave this mortal coil without hearing it!
6305546789|5.0|If you have not seen this FABULOUS film yet, then...well...maybe YOU should start going around in a mask and go to an insane asylum. Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance (RIP), and the terrifying William Shatner mask add  together to make the best horror film of ALL time. Halloween leaves you  with an undeniable chill, rare in the cliched-making-fun-of-cliches films  these days. Worth the money 44504fold.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|The Offspring are,a great band,but this is their worst cd its too alternative,so dont buy this people.
B00004SCX6|1.0|In a few words: this CD stinks. Britney's voice is fake and the lyrics (the ones that you can understand, at least) are predictable and downright boring. All in all, a waste of time.
B000000W6F|5.0|This album is so complete.  I love Suffer and Snail.  Rhinoceros and Tristessa's solos are amazing.  Everyone should have this album.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I've not been a HUGE fan (never negative, more neutral) bout RHCP, liked some of their stuff (what I heard) I do really like this album though... unlike most songs I reallyu like Californication (the title track) doesn't  seem to wear out nor most of the others. As for the &quot;real&quot; Chili  Peppers fans, get a life. They play what they want to, not what you decide.  And popular doesn't equal bad automatically, although, in my opinion, pop  is kinda blah right now (if not downright horrible), but this simply isn't.  Get down off your high horses and just listen to the music.
0871919109|5.0|Mr. Muddle is an endearing character who just can't seem to get anything right. Poor Mr. Muddle muddles everything up, doing the opposite of what he intends. He gets down on his mistakes until his friends and neighbors come  up with a plan to put his muddling to good use. Find out how Mr. Muddle  becomes a success by reading this book. Great for the young and the young  at heart! Another classic tale from the Mr. Men series.

But when Mr. Worry meets up with a friendly Wizard, the Wizard makes all of his worries go away. Mr. Worry finally has  something to smile about!

B000002BUY|5.0|The first Incubus CD I got was make yourself, and I loved it. I wish I could give this album more than 5 stars, because it rocks. It's up there with KoRn's self titled. Asking me to pick a favorite song would be too  hard, since I love them all.
0613083598|5.0|One of the delightful books in the Mr. Men series by Roger Hargreaves. Mr. Bump is one of the best. His trials and tribulations come about from his seemingly innate tendency to get into accidents. Bumping into anything and  everything in his way! Although this problem causes him some problems in  finding a job, after a not-so-quiet vacation to the beach, Mr. Bump  realizes the solution to his job problem. To find out his ideal job you'll  just have to read the book yourself. Great for kids and for kids at heart  as are all the Mr. Men books!
B00004TH6O|4.0|This album is some sort of overview over the various forms of 90's alternative-stoner-grunge-noise-whatever-rock. At first, it is a bit hard to swallow because of the weird sounds and many changes in mood. But you'll  find the quality of the individual songs after listening to it for a few  times. 'In the fade' for example is one of the best songs the Screaming  Trees never wrote, actually sung by the master. If Bob Rock had produced  it, Rated R would probably sell. Check them out live, they'll blow you  away!
0843178388|5.0|Mr. Bump has a problem. He is always getting into accidents,bumping into anything and everything in his way! Although his bumpingdilemma causes him lots of problems in holding a job, after a not-so-bump-free vacation Mr.  Bump realizes the perfect job for him.

B00003CWQ2|5.0|Some people think this movie is bad. But I think that it is good. It shows what it's like to want to be somebody you're not. It is also done very well. I will watch it again and again.<br />(this refers to the VHS edition)
006092988X|5.0|I read this book when I was in junior high (over 20 years ago) &amp; still regard this book as a treasured friend.  Betty Smith's description of life in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is magnificent--you can smell &amp; taste it  right along with Francine.  (The Elia Kazan movie does some justice to the  book--Peggy Ann Garner's portrayal of Francine is haunting &amp; makes  rereads of the book even more enjoyable.)  No matter how many times I read  this book I never get tired of it.  I return happily as if to a long-lost  friend.
B000002KFJ|5.0|simply put this is in the top ten albums of all time.hole in the sky is the best song ever.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Few films offer this much attention to detail. Hitchcock created one of the most elaborate and stylish films ever made. Jimmy Stewart is in top form playing L.B. Jefferies, the photographer who enjoys to spy on his  neighbors in his free time. The beautiful Grace Kelly delivers a strong  female presence in the film, the scene where she first kisses Stewart is  incredibly sexy. While she is not remembered the most by her acting, but  then Hitchcock always said he used women as 'sex objects' and chose them  for their looks (the blonde goddess look seems to be his favorite), however  politically incorrect his methods were, it sure worked, and will keep on  working. Maybe Hitchcock's greatest accomplishment was making us feel like  a 'voyeur', and thinking that Stewart spying on his neighbors is a natural  thing, and we even want him to, more and more, as we get enthralled in the  mystery; did Mr. Thorwald kill his wife and is he really chopping up her  body?. We get hooked on that premise and that is when Hitchcock takes us  for a ride into his psychological roller-coaster, making us; the 'viewer',  feel like the 'voyeur', when we know that it is not right. The extremely  suspenseful ending is a knock-out and the whole film is an example of  Hollywood in it's golden years and of a genius at his peak. Extras: the  usual Hitchcock cameo; the person adjusting the clock in the piano player's  apartment. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!
1568495722|5.0|This book is one of the best for enlightening those of the the 1970's forwrd of the preferred interests of their mothers and fathers. Ex- President Bush  is heavily documented in his actions with those of the  Middle Est in his attempts at acquiring a chunk of the oil industry. It  highlights South America's Venezuela and its failing oil fields. It shows  the world's efforts at unity for one  major purpose. It defines OPEC and  ARAMCO as they need to be understood.    For anyone not current on world  issue, this is the book to read.
6305903182|2.0|The third installment in the extremely popular Scream Trilogy is missing the cleverness, style and wit of its two predecessors. The screenwriter seems to be out of ideas and without any clever tricks to pull out of his  sleeve. Wes Craven is a very clever horror director and has directed many  classics in the genre, but he simply doesn't have the right material here.  The cast also seems tired and they all repeat what they've down in the  previous movies. Some attempts a comedy fall flat, and an assortment of  unlikable supporting characters doesn't help. The 'keep guessing until the  last scene' technique really doesn't work here. Too bad, because the first  two 'Scream' movies we're good and it would have been a memorable trilogy.  From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 3!

B00003CXGG|3.0|This film offers great production design and admirable action sequences. It stars Kung Fu expert Jet Li in his first English-speaking role, he plays an escaped convict out for blood named Han (how original). The film also  features the beautiful and promising Aaliyah as Li's love interest (Juliet,  respectively) Aaliyah and Li have a kind of puppy-love chemistry that keeps  the film above float between Li's fight sequences. All of the other  supporting characters are one-dimensional and some performances are  laughable. The fight scenes are amazing, the one where Li escapes from the  prison and the last fight where they're surrounded by fire are highlights,  also Li figured a way to get Aaliyah in a fight using her legs and arms to  fight off a hostile female fighter because 'I can't hit a girl'. Overall  delivers, but sometimes tries to hard. From a scale of 1-10 I give this  film a 6!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.  Do not review this movie or you will be breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.  This is all I have to say.
B00004RFFM|4.0|Okay, its not Jaws, nothing will be JAWS, but i loved this film.  The special effects and underwater sequences are amazing.  There is a bit of predictability, and it is somewhat formulaic but it gets the job done.  Its  just great action, great effects and a great end result.  One of the best  things i liked about the movie was the real deep blue hue that you see and  feel throughout the film.  Because everybody is underwater the whole time,  you almost feel like you are in space because it is so dark, and resulting  from that is a sense of claustrophobia that helps along the story line.   Some people didn't like this movie, because the acting wasn't very good,  and the characters a bit wooden, but if they weren't expecting that before  going in than of course you would be disappointed.  This is not Oscar  stuff, but its a good shark film, worth seeing.
B000000WF0|5.0|Easily the most played CD in our home this past year. Urban Hymns is a dizzying emotional rollercoaster ride of soulful pop.  Starting an album with a track as strong as Bitter Sweet Symphony seems like a crazy concept  (How could ANY following song resonate with listeners when they've just  experienced one of those preciously rare gems, a perfect pop song?), but  the other tunes are strong enough to pull you into their own conciousness.   Lucky Man is almost on par with Bitter Sweet as far as stirring the  emotions up.  This album is so good, it hurts knowing this band is no  longer together, lessening the chance of coming across another collection  this strong for a long while
B000002C2E|5.0|I grew up with Bob Dylan playing on my dad's stereo.  I truly love a lot of his &quot;old&quot; stuff.  However, I only bought a Dylan disk, this one, when I had the opportunity to see him touring with Paul Simon (why buy  them when I can borrow them from dad?).  While I am not a fan of the first  song, the rest of the disk is terrific.  Ranging from foot stompin' blues  to downright rock to amazingly introspective ballads, this disk has  everything that Dylan does best.  Now my one and three year olds will be  exposed to the same legendary music I was, and a new generation will  realize how truly gifted Dylan is.
B00004THAY|5.0|Eric Clapton has returned to the blues again, in a CD that will compare favorably with &quot;From the Cradle&quot;.  Paired with BB King (who, of course, never strays from the Blues into pop territory), the two guitar  masters weave their way through a number of blues standards and some  surprises.  You can't go wrong with a John Hiatt, Isaac Hayes, or Johnny  Mercer penning your non-blues entries. Each song becomes a guitar/vocal  duel that intensifies throughout each number.   One minor quibble with the  album Isaac Hayes' Sam &amp; Dave favorite &quot;Hold On, I'm Coming&quot;   sorely misses the signature brass line from the original.  If they could  get strings for &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot;, why not a horn section  for this soul classic? And on &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot;  both do  such an excellent job with a classic torch song, you long for an entire  album in that style. Let's hope the ride is a round trip with a return in  the not too distant future.
B00004U2A2|5.0|Evil Dead 2, unlike its predisessor, manages to stimulate humor within the often shady realm of classic horror.  It's charactors express overacted emmotions, the monsters are obsessively intense, and the plot-line is too  short to be expressed in a complete sentence.  But you know what, that's  the beauty of it all.  The beauty to create a movie that mocks its own  gender.  Yes, a horror movie with an even greater tick.  The ability to  raise suspense, horror, and tension to a level of, almost, playfulness. Now  don't get me wrong, Evil Dead 2 is not a movie that raises even the lowest  form of phylisophical issues, but it is an enjoyable masterwork of nifty  cinematography and compelling suspense that is anything but classic.  The  acting is excellent, in which the actors and actresses seem to play their  obsene roles with a sense of dignity.  Some of the camera techniques in the  movie are arguably the best I've ever experienced. The possessed monsters  create even more tension and possibility, but not enough as to take the  story really seriously.  Every scene conveys an obviouse delight for  cinematic adventure.  More importantly, the hero Ash, a Rambo/Mad Max  charactor, remains the bulk of the film.  With his jerky wit (not too  jerky) and ignorant macho attitude, its no wonder why this original figure  holds such high standerds in the indi culture.  The other charactors (and  their relationships) adjust to the absurd atmosphere perfectly, with their  cheesy &quot;horror lines&quot; and cocky reactions.  The whole feature is  just a heap of creative genous, nothing more.  Anyone who has an urge for  destructive horror with a humorous beat, will be more than satisfied to  view every pixel this film has to offer.  The blood level is above the  charts and the action is magestically in-sinch.  Sound is average, as well  as the picture quality, but isn't enough to complain about.  I give this  movie full credit for occomplishing its purpose, however simple that task  may be.  See it to believe it folks; buy it to believe it again and again.   (oh, and good job Sam, you're a master in my book)
B00004RF9I|3.0|&quot;Network&quot; is a well-made, well-acted movie with many deservedly famous scenes. This adds up to a good movie that's enjoyable to watch...but not a movie that's exactly profound. Paddy Chayefsky obviously thought he  was writing a cutting-edge satire on television and society. What he came  up with was two hours of reactionary ranting against television, business,  the younger generation, and anything else Paddy was feeling sour  about.<br />Chayefsky's &quot;messages&quot; are beyond banal; they're cliches  that are as old as television itself. Television lies to us. People can't  tell television from reality. People raised on television (like the Faye  Dunaway character) are emotionally stunted, not like wonderful middle-aged  people like Chayefsky. We're all losing our humanity, Chayefsky tells us;  Pauline Kael rightly sneered: &quot;Who has--*him*?&quot; Chayefsky is so  wedded to these mediaphobic cliches that he can't for a minute grasp the  possibility that viewers can distinguish television from reality, or that  television is no better or worse than any other form of popular  media--emphatically including movies. There's something faintly ridiculous  about the movies, a medium in which lies and distortions are inherent, for  attacking the lies and distortions in another medium.<br />As befits a veteran  of the &quot;golden age&quot; of TV drama, Chayefsky's dialogue is filled  with heavy-handed preaching (Holden and Finch get the worst of it), and  features some truly atrociously written scenes, the worst of which features  poor Beatrice Straight screaming idiotic lines at the top of her lungs; she  inexplicably won an Oscar for that. As for Faye Dunaway's character,  Chayefsky's misogyny--his dislike of a woman in a position of  power--combined with his hatred of anyone young makes her character a dull  cartoon, though Dunaway tries her best.<br />So enjoy NETWORK for the  entertaining film it is, but remember, when Peter Finch shouts  &quot;Television is not the truth,&quot; someone really ought to shout  back: &quot;NETWORK is not the truth either.&quot; It's been over twenty  years, and the world has not gone to hell in Mr. Chayefsky's video  handbasket; we're still here, television is still here, and generation  after generation will keep arriving to disprove Chayefsky's insulting  notion that the influence of television has made us all inferior to him.
6303433766|5.0|I loved this movie! 2 girls find eachother, become intimate friends and are torn part by parents leading to a matricide. You can't tear away from this film. The imagry is great, the fantasy is exquisite, the suspense is  mind tearing, and the romance is touching. This film has it all! An  especially touching film for those familiar with going through their own  self discovery.
B000002UKS|5.0|This CD is wonderful. After being a hard core NIN fan for over three years I had dug a whole so deep that only The Foo Fighters and there spazztic tunes could pull me out of it.  I have been in a good mood for over a week  now ( a personal record for me).  This mood started when I got this CD!   And there are only two really stupid tracks on it!  That's wonderfully  uncommon in today's music.        The album starts out with the short but  great song Doll which has a wonderful transition to Monkey Wrench.  The  climax of the album has to be Everlong...the best song ever made!
6304899335|4.0|This is a solid direction done by Hitchcock.  The story of an everyman caught in bad situation.  Sound familiar?  As it should for fans of Hitchcock.  An earlier work for Alfred, you can see him still finding his  style.  If you enjoyed this, I would recommend &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; as  well.
B00004SCX6|5.0|A very good CD.  It is a whole lot better than her first.  I love all the dance tracks, especially Lucky and Oops.  I have to say, however, that the ballads are bad.  There are only a few people that can sing ballads well  and Britney really shouldn't.  However, I'm not a young teenage girl, so  don't think this is only for young girls.  Lots of people like her who are  not teenage girls.  I like her music and I like Mozart.  So people can have  all sorts of tastes.

B000002GWN|5.0|I loved listening to this album back in the mid'70s during my college days, and I still enjoy it just as much today.   The combination of Joni with Tom Scott and the L.A. Express gives some of her earlier songs a new  sound that worked remarkably well.  I've been disappointed that a lot of  live albums don't really capture the feel of the concert well, and they  don't have the sound quality of a studio album.  This CD seems to do both.   &quot;A Case of You&quot; and &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot; are  my personal favorites, but there is not a dud in the entire lineup of  songs.  Anyone who is even marginally a Joni Mitchell fan will enjoy this  one.
6301543408|3.0|NOTE: This following is being taken by my site's &quot;Star Trek V Evaluation&quot;. Is Star Trek V: The Final Frontier a bad film? Some people say it is, while others say it is underrated. Well, what is the truth? I have broken down the movie scene-by-scene. I have rated each scene  on a scale of 1-to-4, with 4 being the best. Using this system, we can  average out the scenes and discover how the film is as a whole. Please note  that this isn't just my opinion. I have talked to other Trek fans about the  flaws and strengths in the film and have taken those evaluations into  account with my judging of the scenes. All-in-all, this is still only  opinion, but take it into consideration when judging the film as a  whole.<br />THE SCENES <br />1. Sybok's Introduction A great scene. Well filmed.  The emotion felt when Sybok relieves the man's pain feels genuine. Then the  surprise as we discover he is a Vulcan -- then he laughs! After  &quot;You're a Vulcan!&quot;, Larry does the Spock isn't-it-obvious eyebrow  thing perfectly. The fade to white as the movie begins and the familiar  &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme by Alexander Courage is heard... wow. This  reminded me of the Original Series, when we were given a teaser before the  show began. It's one of the best, if not the best, openings of all the Star  Trek movies, and probably always will be. RATING: 3.75 <br />2. Opening  Credits Also a good scene. They pan up to the sun, which becomes a star.  Then they show outer space, then they show a beautiful establishing shot of  Yosemite and El Capitan. The rock climbing scenes look real. It's the only  Star Trek film that gives us a moment of quiet reflection during the  credits. McCoy even gives us dialogue that is a wink to The Original  Series. Well done! RATING: 3.25 <br />3. Kirk's Chat With Spock And The  Fall/Rescue From Mountain A weaker scene. The dialogue about &quot;gravity  of the situation&quot; is a little silly. Kirk's fall looks real in some  shots (some people in the audience actually gasped!) but looks very fake in  others (obvious blue-screen). Spock's Superman imitation hurts the scene,  too. Some say they can see the cable when it shows Spock holding Kirk.  Plus, the &quot;Mind if we drop in for dinner?&quot; line is a groaner.  It's a cute scene, but too cute. RATING: 2.00 <br />4. Paradise City And The  Taking Of The Hostages  A credible scene.  The introductions of the  representatives are brief to keep the scenes moving.  The taking of the  hostages are well-done and quick.  The scene serves its purpose and leaves  us wondering what will happen.  RATING: 2.75 <br />5. Scotty And Uhura Are  Apprised Of The Nimbus III Situation  Another credible scene with nice  moments.  They are advised of their status.  There's nothing wrong with  this scene, for it moves the story forward without being dull.  RATING:  2.50 <br />6. Sulu And Chekov Get Lost  A weaker scene.  Purely for cheap  laughs.  Nice to see their close friendship (always implied but never  stated in TOS, as when Sulu knew Chekov had no brother) has been remembered  by the writers. I missed it. Although it does provide a chuckle or two,  it's a rather pointless scene.  RATING: 2.00 <br />7. The Campfire Scene   Ah... the famous (infamous?) campfire scene.  This one is a toughy.  Fans  are divided on this scene.  Some think it's too silly and runs too long,  while others say it's the most endearing and sweetest scene in all of Star  Trek.  I think it's a good scene, but lengthy.  Hearing them sing  &quot;row, row, row your boat&quot; is a hoot, and their discussion of  their friendship is a nice touch. The &quot;Goodnight Bones/Spock/Jim&quot;  scene may be silly, but 3 old pros pull it off beautifully. Their timing is  right on the mark. Nice little touches, as when Kirk tells Spock to call  him Jim, Spock broaches a subject Kirk's too tired to get into, Kirk  reverts back to Captain mode, Spock calls him Captain again. The whole  exchange was 4 lines, butbeautifully done.  But due to mixed reactions,  I'll rate it about in the middle.   RATING: 2.50 <br />8. Klaa's Introduction   A credible scene.  It's direct and to the point.  It introduces Klaa (and  the subplot) effectively.  RATING: 2.50 <br />9. Uhura Picks Up Kirk, Spock,  And McCoy  Another quick, direct scene that moves the plot forward.    RATING: 2.50 <br />10. Shuttle Enters The Enterprise  A nice scene.  The  return of the shuttlecraft is welcomed, and is well-filmed.  The &quot;well  versed in the classics&quot; line is actually funny and well-done.  The  only drawback is that it's not really important to the plot except for  forshadowing the shuttle's use later.  RATING: 2.75 <br />11. Kirk Is Apprised  Of Mission  A good scene.  Bennett's cameo is a nice in-joke.  The &quot;I  miss my old chair&quot; line, followed by Spock's sympathetic look, is very  funny.  The plot is moved forward nicely.  RATING: 2.75 <br />12. Klaa  Discovers Kirk Is Going To Nimbus III  Another quick scene that reenforces  Klaa's motivations.  A bit less important, though. <br />RATING: 2.50 <br />13.  Crew Views The Hostage Tape  A very nice scene.  Kirk's comments on Korrd  are interesting.  Spock's line about perhaps &quot;seeing a ghost&quot;  make us curious.  Except for the Captain's Log Recorder breaking down, this  scene is very well-done.  RATING: 3.00 <br />14. Spock Explains Sybok To Kirk  And McCoy  A wonderful scene.  It gives us another moment of quiet  reflection and Nimoy does a wonderful job telling the tale of Sybok.  The  observation lounge is a nice set, too. For the first time Kirk's wearing  one of those Starfleet casual jackets, seen on Scotty in ST III. Nice  consistency, and nice tailoring too. Also, the lounge seemed like a nice  precursor to 10-forward. RATING: 3.25 <br />15. Enterprise Orbits Nimbus III   A great, however unfortunately brief, scene.  RATING: 3.25 <br />16. Kirk  Takes A Shuttle Down To Nimbus III  A well-directed scene.  The shuttle  interior shot is great, and the SFX are pretty good, as well. Nice to see  the redshirts; skeleton crew or not. It still takes more than a monkey and  two trainees to run that ship. RATING: 3.25 <br />17. &quot;Captain  Chekov&quot; Talks To Sybok  This is a nice scene.  It gives Koenig a cute  moment without being silly.  Plus, again, it moves the story forward.   RATING: 3.00 <br />18. Uhura's Fan Dance  One of the worst scenes in the film.   Some argue that Uhura wouldn't dance naked to distract the lookout party.   I feel she would, but it's irrelevant.  The scene is just too silly.   Though I liked the way one of the men says &quot;Ohhh... damn!&quot;   RATING: 1.50 <br />19. The Fight On Nimbus III To Rescue The Hostages  Wow!    An excellent scene!  One of the best in the film.  This is the only  ground-fighting we've ever scene in the Star Trek films, and is directed  great! Nice reminder these are military people who've worked well as a unit  for thirty years (&quot;Sulu, take out that light!&quot;) Nicest phaser  stuns I've ever seen (you could feel the impact).  RATING: 3.75 <br />20. Kirk  Fights A Feline Alien  Definitely weak.  The scene is clunky and the cougar  sound effects make the scene laughable instead of exciting. Though the rest  of the scene is okay. RATING: 1.75 <br />21. Sybok Captures Kirk, Spock, And  McCoy  A good scene.  Sybok's talk with Spock is very good, and some of the  shots use a well-done &quot;hand-held&quot; camera shot.    RATING: 3.00  <br />22. The Emergency Shuttle Landing Plan &quot;B&quot;  Another good  scene.  The &quot;B&quot; dialouge is cute, but not bad.  The shuttle  thrusting into the Enterprise is exciting and well-done. Also nice to see  Kirk and the general relate to each other as military men.  RATING: 3.00  <br />23. Kirk Fights Sybok/Spock Confronts Sybok  Yet another good scene.   The hand-to-hand between Kirk and the much-stronger Sybok is good.  And the  confrontation between Sybok and Spock is tense.  That look on Kirk's face  as he turns his back on Spock is packed with emotion....END
6305622930|5.0|Why doesn't Hollywood make movies like this one anymore?  Saving Private  Ryan was close but Patton seems to give the audience more insite and depth  to its character.  Patton in my eyes was one of the greatest warriors of  the 20th century and this movie takes you into the life of Patton and shows  you what passion a man had for his job and further more for his country.  I  highly recomend this film.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Everyone should own this cd!   I would give it more stars but five is all I'm allowed!  It has music for every mood:  hyper, mellow, happy, sad, and even romantic (Everloving especially).  Every one of the cd's I own has one  or two songs that I skip over because I don't like them, but I can listen  to this from beginning to end without skipping over anything.  Play is a  definite &quot;must have&quot; for everyone, not just Moby fans.
0486407217|4.0|Good techniques for a lost art.  Anyone who enjoys sewing authentic Victorian clothes, not just Victorian-styled clothes should buy this book.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite cd's ever.  Dido's songs are beautifully and emotionally written and contain themes that everyone can relate to such as love, friendship, and broken hearts.  I bought No Angel  after hearing &quot;Here With Me&quot; twice on the radio and instantly  fell in love with it.  I've passed it on to friends who have passed it on  to friends and everyone thanks me for getting them hooked on this extremely  talented artist.  If you have a chance to see Dido live, do it.  The music  is absolutely enchanting.  It was a surprise to hear such a rich sound  coming from this small person but she was incredible.  So buy this cd right  now, you will not be disappointed!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Are you kidding me?   Drop the hype and look at the album if he was not as famous as he became.  Em's lyrics are not only witty, but powerful.  Yes, this album is not for uptight people, but for those of us who like to live a little and speak our minds.  Sit back, listen, and laugh.
6300181685|3.0|My sister and I watched this movie together about 20 years ago when we were kids. George C. Scott gives a good performance, although we did get a good laugh out of the General trying to hang on as the Hindenburgh crashes  to the earth.
0783242808|5.0|American Pie is a well written, well played movie about the real issues in teens life. The characters portrayed in the film can be related to many young males across the country. Jason Biggs made a breakthrough performance  and has proved to be the next big thing. I give great praise to this film  and out of 4 stars, I give it 5. If Jason Biggs ever sees this, please  e-mail me(hey it might not happen but it doesn't hurt to try)  Moonstar1117@aol.com :)
0805062971|4.0|For me, Fight Club was a spontaneous experience.  I went to themovies to see the Sixth Sense and it just happened to be opening nightfor Fight Club.  So I went to see it instead, because I liked Ed Norton in Primal Fear.  I seriously expected a movie like an adult version of Karate Kid, what I got was one of the best movies I've ever seen.<BR> Of course, I went out and read the book soon after, and my honest opinion is this: the movie is better.<BR> However, there is a dilema involved here, there is a major plot twist in the story.  If you see the movie first, the book experience is ruined.  If you read the book first, the movie experience is ruined.  My view may have been swayed by this factor.<BR> The book is completely different though. This is not some 'book of the movie', the book was written four years earlier, and both have very different endings.<BR> The problem with the book is not that its gut-wrenchingly hardcore when compared to the movie, its that there are other factors here that the movie left out that detract from the story.<BR> And what a story it is.  A regular office worker, like almost anybody these days, comes to the realisation that the only reason he earns money is to buy useless furnishings.  He is part of the IKEA generation.<BR> Then he meets Tyler Durden, a man who believes that the only way to self discovery is self destruction.  Together they start Fight Club, a group that quickly gains a massive following.<BR> I enjoyed the book, and I recommned it to anyone who enjoyed the movie.  You'll find that it adds new depth to the story, and the alternate ending is quite interesting.<BR> My hat comes off to Jim Uhls who wrote the movie script though, the two manage to be completely different, and yet there is barely one line in the movie that isn't in the book.<BR>
6304795254|5.0|This movie is so complex and thought provoking... it has you guessing the entire time! It is unlike any suspense or mystery movie you'll every see. The twist at the end is amazing and I guarantee you WON'T see it coming.  I'd recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It will definitely leave  you with a smile of amazement!
6305252521|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the nineties... funny yes..sad yes...but most of all a chilling reminder of the infinite effects television has on our lives. One of the most moving pieces of cinema I have ever  witnessed..when TRUMAN realises what his life has been...will long stay in  my memory. Carrey is brilliant...his best role ever..Ed Harris is superb as  the bad guy... The soundtrack is exceptional...the photography brilliant  and the tight editing never allows the  film to labour at any time. The  film is on my shopping list when released on DVD in Australia...i cant  wait... This blackest of comedies deserves six stars!
B000023VR6|5.0|Let me make this short and sweet.  You are under my control and are going to go out and by this album right now!  This is one of the best albums EVER!  There is no doubt in my mind that this is true.  Do yourself a favor  and get it if you haven't already done so.
6305558167|5.0|I loved this movie on its release almost 20 years ago...i have had it on VHS for years and watched it often. Now released on DVD, with the addition of a remastered soundtrack...Dolby Digital 5.1... and superb picture  transfer quality..this film takes on new dimensions..although being an  Arthurian purist I still cant forgive some glaring omissions, such as the  Black Knight and  of course  Sir Galahad...the character of Sir Percival  has to carry the bulk of the hasty conclusion to the film.<br />The  photography is stunning, the acting patchy: although Gabriel Byrne in an  early career role is good...but the film belongs to Nicol Williamson as  Merlin....it is one of cinema's finest performances from this rarely seen  actor. I watched this DVD on a Toshiba SD9000 DVD PLAYER ....IT IS A REGION  4 PAL Version disc... I use a Yamaha RX-V995.Audio Video Receiver... and  Aaron Main and surround speakers and sub woofer... It is an audio visual  feast..the music is goose bump stuff. Enjoy
B000002UA0|5.0|Although just about everything from the sixties sounds today dated and flat, Pink Floyd's seminal first album still sizzles with the energy of the LSD that powered it. Syd Barrett, the enigmatic and mercurial genius who  led the band at that point, successfully used his opus The Piper At The  Gates Of Dawn to showcase two sides of psychedelic experimentation. Both  the bright, glittering and fun aspect of LSD, and its shadowy, dangerous  underbelly with undertones of chaos, are shown here.<br />Pink Floyd's Piper  is so much more than the acid-pop and space-rock that show up at first  glance. Underneath the bright exterior, we see flashes of extreme disorder.  &quot;I've got a clan of gingerbread men,&quot; sings Barrett illogically  in the album's stunning conclusion 'Bike'. He goes on to speak of talking  mice and living music before the song disintegrates into a series of warped  chimes and ticks, sounds that could never occur in the physical world, but  almost appear as if they could.<br />The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn  successfully stands up to great post-Barrett Floyd albums like Wish You  Were Here and The Dark Side Of The Moon. At its best, it eclipses them;  unlike Waters, Barrett knew the secret of composing melodies as well as  dense aural landscapes. He balances short, poppish numbers like &quot;The  Gnome&quot; with longer space-rock freakouts such as &quot;Interstellar  Overdrive&quot;.<br />In 1967, famous albums like the Beatles' &quot;Sgt.  Pepper&quot;, the Velvet Underground's &quot;Velvet Underground &amp;  Nico&quot;, and Jefferson Airplane's &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; were  created. Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn, one of the ultimate  masterpieces of all time in the psychedelic genre, at times surpasses them  all.<br />Nutty X
6304994540|5.0|First, read all seven novels of Raymond Chandler. That's the beginning. (Yes, The Dude is Marlowe.)<br /><br />Next, compare the film to two other all-time greats: Richard Lester's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (music; nearly flawless cinematography; absurd and jarring juxtapositions) and Richard Linklater's BEFORE SUNRISE (the thematic similarity: the attempt to communicate meaningfully as a member of the human species). If you don't get the connections I suggest, then you won't get the connections. (There's a beverage here, man!)<br /><br />Next, recognize that cult films reverberate for a reason. Meeting a random guy at a bar with whom one suddenly forms a strong bond when one utters the line, \\"Effing Nazis\\": that's indicative of deep structures. One must assume that this film reaches far into the human psyche without one's needing to understand why.<br /><br />Next, recognize that the casting is perfect, as is the frame-by-frame editing. Note that The Stranger makes the film possible.<br /><br />Note that the music is as big a character as Walter and the Dude. Without the music, it would not be the greatest film ever made.<br /><br />Note that one primary theme is the human race's attempt to communicate with mutual understanding and that in every instance in the film, the attempt fails. (Again, compare with BEFORE SUNRISE. Linklater's film is the other end of the continuum, but the theme is precisely the same.)<br /><br />Note, then, the irony that the audience understands this perfectly (that the film is about the inability of humans to understand one another), even if one might not be able to articulate the idea.<br /><br />Note that one of the reasons the film cuts so deeply is that we ourselves are The Dude. (We have seen ourselves, and we are The Dude. And we are Walter. And Donny. And little Larry.)<br /><br />Note that one can watch the film a seemingly infinite number of times and still find nuances that one has missed. The film coheres and coheres and coheres, although it's a film about incoherence.<br /><br />Note how well one can make analogies with other works that feature Jungian archetypes: THE WIZARD OF OZ; GONE WITH THE WIND; DEATH OF A SALESMAN; riff on forever--this is a remarkable embodiment of our heroes with a thousand faces.)<br /><br />Note that the jokes never cease to be funny. \\"An Irish monk?\\" \\"It's already the tenth.\\" \\"The Supreme Court has roundly rejected Prior Restraint.\\"<br /><br />Okay, that's enough from me. The Coens had extra time on this one because of the delay in getting Bridges and Goodman at the same time. So these fanatic storyboarders had time to be more fanatical than usual. They were inspired. The timing was right. They transcended themselves. There is no explanation.<br /><br />Serious scholars can write enlightening books about this film. I suggest a few angles above. The Chandler interconnections alone are worth a monograph.<br /><br />But one need not write such stuff unless one enjoys the process.<br /><br />Because that, too, is the whole point: Enjoy it. Despite the police chief of Mailbu, it's the whole dern human comedy. Watch it again and again because one then can feel that one wasn't gypped by the good Lord.<br /><br />(And if you never got it: \\"I see England, I see France; I see queenie's underpants.\\" That's a clunker.)<br /><br />Here's what I wrote years ago about the film. It's still true:<br /><br />One needs to have a pronounced sense of absurdity to appreciate this film. But personally having an existence in which I have been forced to worship the Great God Irony, I find THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be truly a perfect film.  Its humor is incessant; its ensemble cast performs flawlessly; the closing  image of a professional bowler scoring yet another strike surely is  emblematic of the film's own technical, emotional, artistic, intellectual,  and psychological success.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges as the Dude, a sixties burn-out and slacker--and John Goodman as Walter Sobchek,  VietnamVet and devout Jew--form a heavenly  union. The shaggy-dog-story plot is the skeleton upon  which hangs an utterly immaculate set of absurdist images, from the  Hispanic deodorizer of shoes to the BRANDED writer in the iron lung to the  blanket-tossed beach party babe (whose costume changes to a devilish red when she's glimpsed in the Dude's dream sequence: only the Coen brothers could incorporate such minor details with such intelligence and  purpose!).<br /><br />I've watched this film literally twenty times. Its power does  not fade. It satisfies every time. Each moment, each camera angle, each  cut, each fade, each expression, each utterance: perfection itself! The  maniacally laughing policeman in the car lot; the In-and-Out Burgers through the broken windshield; the crematorial ashes in the Dude's face:  what brilliance!<br /><br />Buy it; watch it again and again. Ye who have eyes and ears to see and hear--enjoy!<br /><br />To all the people involved in making the film: congratulations on being in precisely the right place at the right time. Life almost never works this way. And that's why we like the Dude at the check-out line with the half-and-half on his mustache. The Dude: C'est moi!
B000006NPY|4.0|Sadly in this day in age a familer pattern seems to follow many rock groups.  After putting out what is considered thier greatest (and often most succesful)work the band is expected to follow-up on this.  Both the  record industry and the people who buy the music await a repeat performance  that will cash in on the succesful formula of the last release.  However  many rock artists are exaxtly that: ARTISTS.  They choose to develop their  sound and push the envelope rather than repeat themselves.  This is exactly  what has happened with The Smashing Pumpkins on Adore.  The band met with  universal acclaim on theie Mellon Collie CD and opted to expand on their  next recording rather than recylce any old sounds.  What we get is one of  the most brilliant and ambitious albums in a long time.  It certainly isn't  rock and it isn't pop, it's just the Smashing Pumpkins.  It's nothing less  than what you'd expect from Billy Corgan; magnificantly uncompromising  music that will challenge the listner while giving them a slight taste of  the familer.  The gothic techno sound of Adore is hard to swallow at first  but in time can offer a fullfilling and remarkable listening experince.   Unfortunately most people won't even give this record the time of day  because there's no Cherub Rock or Bullet with Butterfly Wings here.  Thier  loss.
6304383827|5.0|Why does everyone seem to be hounding on Miss Paltrow's talents? She is a very beautiful actress and proved to us there's more to just beauty in her performance. Paltrow executed her lines with stunning realism taking on the  meddling, quirky traits of Emma Woodhouse. Jane Austen would be ecstatic at  the flawless portrayal of her most controversial heroine. And the other  actors were superb too. Mr. Knightly was just that: a knight in shining  armor. And Mr. Elton was the scoundrel you love to hate. And the rest of  the cast, oh, I could write volumes on their performances as well. So, if  you haven't at least seen this movie, rent it!
B00004SCX6|1.0|More inane, brainless cream puff filling from the blonde bubbleheaded lipsyncing super twinkie. Track no. 8 is almost halfway decent, but doesn't quite make it that high. A sickening and saddening attempt to separate as  many hype sensitive, naive, follow the herd 13 yr old sheep from their  lawnmowing and babysitting money.
B000000WA4|5.0|This cd is a double dose of the spectacular music this band can create.  This is my favorite album in my collection by far.  I don't think an album this devine could ever be reproduced due to the versatility and complexity  that lies in these songs.  There is a track on this cd to represent every  possible emotion you could ever feel in an entire lifetime of adolescence  or adulthood.  There is SOOOO much feeling and power in the voice of Billy  Corgan.  His lyrics are the most poetic and meaningful on this album than  any other of their efforts.  The band was also flawless in concert and I  can't wait for the reunion 10-15 yrs. from now so I can see them again.   &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot; is my personal favorite of the  Smashing Pumpkins (which is on this album).  When you listen to that song,  it feels like ... a dream.  It's about the fact that the perfect love of  your life is only in your dreams, but when you do dream about it, it's  beautiful because it can bring out the best in you.  What a concept! I  absolutely love this cd.
B0000065M3|3.0|While his &quot;new&quot; music, including the very important title &quot;In The Ghetto&quot;, was getting good notice across the world, this socially-conscious movie was in release. Unfortunately, the &quot;Made For  TV&quot; quality made this respectable effort a minor work, which did  showcase strong  performances by Presley as an inner city Doctor and by  Mary Tyler Moore as a Nun who wants to try a different approach in a  complex setting. The music is very agreeable and is well interpolated - dig  Elvis on piano (&quot;Lawdy, Miss Clawdy&quot;) and singing along with  Darlene Love (&quot;Rubberneckin'&quot;). The somewhat non-traditional  &quot;Let Us Pray&quot; number might suggest the controversial &quot;gospel  rock&quot; of future decades. The difficult physical/spiritual theme  warranted more time and attention than was presumeably allowed and perhaps  accounts for the film's lesser-known status.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|This movie would have to be one of the best ever. It not only offers entertainment like never before but it also educates us to some extent. It takes us on a rollercoaster ride on how a white collar worker suffering  from insomnia deals with life.<br />There is no other movie like it. This is  original and stays true to the novel. These are just a few of the reasons  this is a great movie. The movie isn't just men fighting with each other,  like trailers and the name itself may lead some people to think. There is  only about 10% of the movie where there are two people beating on each  other. It's a movie where you just can't stop watching, it keeps you  thinking all the way through it and you can watch this movie over and over.  The cast was excellent and they played their roles without fault. Edward  Norton is the real star in this movie, you will realize this in the first  10 minutes. Some of the greatest dialogue is heard in the first 10 minutes  and continues all the way through.<br />There is a lot more to Fight Club than  meets the eye. It is a must watch for anyone really. But whatever you do,  watch till the end!
6302638771|5.0|Forget about the fact that Oliver Stone's bias skewed some of the facts in the film.  Forget the fact that occasionally Kevin Costner's suthun' accent slips a little bit. Forget that fact that your bum may ache a little after  sitting through this film's epic running time.  The one fact that remains  is that when all is said and done, this is one heck of an ambitious and  (above all) endlessly intriguing masterpiece that has effectively  dramatized one of the most enduring passions of Americans for the past  forty years, and it stands as a towering triumph and call to arms for the  simple advocacy of something that our government (including the present,  past, and probably future administrations) consistently chooses to keep  from the citizens of this nation: T-R-U-T-H.  In the years to come,  regardless of a few historical machinations, it is my hope that this film  is shown in classrooms across the nation along with classics like  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; or &quot;Glory.&quot;  5 stars (of 5)
B00004RITP|5.0|Simon Rattle who consider the 10th one of the best of Mahler's symphonies conducted Berliner Philhamoniker performing this work in the concert after he had been elected as the artist director of the BPO.No doubt that it is a  memorabale recording.Though the 10th is not well regarded by some of the  musicians such as Beinstein,Walter, Simon Rattle show his distinguishing  ability in the 10th by interpreting the &quot;new&quot; music. For the  music fans who truly love Mahler must be attracted by the music,because it  is really the Mahler's style(it may be the best).   In another word,Rattle  choosed the work to play in this important concert,it showed this work is a  valueable and meaningful work.Every time Rattle conducts the Berliner  Philhamoniker gives people wonderful feelings and makes the BPO blaze  again, so as this time.Thanks to Rattle contributing      this good  performence of Mahler's great work.
B000006NPY|1.0|Picture this. A short, scrawny kid wearing an oversized black Smashing Pumpkins t-shirt and jeans walks through his middle school. A student yells from across the hall, &quot;Pumpkins suck!&quot; ...I've been hearing this ever since those days in 6th grade, but, unlike then, now  I'm inclined to believe.... Back then  they all meant that Billy Corgan was a messed up poser, writing crappy lerics about  &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate.&quot; Back then they were wrong. I was  surrounded by the melodies that are Gish, Siamese Dream, and Mellon  Collie...No more. Billy has now sunk to a level that I never would have  expected from the man who's pictures cover my room. With Adore he has put  down his guitar and laid his calus-stricken hands on a keyboard. He has put  on black leather dresses, and in the process lost that which drove him to  write some of the best music I have ever heard. Coming off the incredible  concept album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, his has settled for  unfulfilling radio songs like Ava Adore and Perfect. However I must be  clear in the fact that this is only my opinion. At a recent concert in  Portland, I saw people moved by Adore in the way that I am by Siamese Dream  and Mellon Collie. One thing is for sure, this album is Different; right  down to the font on the cover. Those who recognized the sheer genious in  the guitar playing, and fiercely powerfull presence that Billy used to have  at Pumpkin's concerts will be let down by this CD. And as hard as it is to  admit, Machina is NO different.  Hummers of the world unite! Pray that Mr.  Corgan will quit playing mind games with himself and us and pick back up  his sticker-covered Strat and rock our worlds.
B00004THAY|5.0|... but I'll be on my way to the store as soon as I completethis &quot;review.&quot;...<br />Blues? Guitars? Vocals? BB King &amp;Eric Clapton? - Together? Can anyone spell ... NO BRAINER?<br />I once heard a story from Chris Tarrant (London Radio DJ and originator of the &quot;Millionaire&quot; game show) about how The 'Profession' column in Clapton's passport is filled out with the title of &quot;LEGEND.&quot; - Nothing less can be said of BB - Teacher, Mentor and (with little argument) only the best Bluesman ever.<br />And if you're accusing me of being an apologist for these Fine Gentlemen of the Strings? - go ahead and fasten the handcuffs - but please! let me get to the store first!
0783240236|5.0|You can't be wrong with this DVD. It's the perfect gift to offer to your mother-in-law or, if you're the selfish movie lover I'm sure you are, it will soon become one of your favorite DVD. Extra-features, for once, are  very instructive AND interesting. The copy is quite perfect : I had the  feeling to rediscover a brand new movie after so many bad copies seen in  local theatres or during the late-late TV shows (did you notice that,  nowadays, if you want to see a good movie on TV, you have to wait for the  end of night ?).<br />I know that Hitchcock's aficionados prefer the movies  shot in the 50's by the Master or, for those who want to show their  culture, the British period BUT exclusively before 1930. So I admit that I  have a pretty bad taste because I love THE BIRDS ; I can see this movie  once a year and never be tired of it.<br />I admire Tippi Hedren, I admire the  way Alfred Hitchcock has photographed Tippi Hedren, I admire Tippi Hedren's  classy incarnation of a high society child. Besides, the couple  Hedren-Taylor works perfectly and you never have the feeling that they are  nothing more than a pale copy of, let's say, Grace Kelly and Cary  Grant.<br />Jessica Tandy is the usual possessive mother with the murderous  sparkle in her left eye and Suzanne Pleshette has a great second role. And  you have this subtle British humor during the scene involving the two  lovebirds in Tippi Hedren's car. Remember ? No ? So buy the DVD !<br />A DVD  for your library.
B000001IPL|5.0|I loved Smash by The Offspring. All of the tracks are great. Nitro is a great opening track, exciting and powerful. Bad Habit is the ultimate driving song. Gotta Get Away is a funny neurotic song. Genocide is amazing  and very powerful. Something to Believe in isn't my favorite but isn't bad  either. Come Out and Play, one of my favorite songs, was deservedly a big  hit. Self Esteem is another great single. It'll Be a Long Time has a great  message and is a great song too. Killboy Powerhead is a great cover, better  than the original. What Happened to You? is unique and interesting. So  Alone is a good song. Not the One gives voice to the concerns of many teens  and is a good one to bang your head to at the same time. Smash is another  of my favorites, The Offspring's most underrated song. Overall, this is a  great CD and should be in every rock collection.
0061007137|5.0|I have read extensively out of Jeffrey Archers repetoire and have found all of the books not only palatiable, but also intriguing reads.<br />I read this book 5 years ago, and make it a point to read it at least once a year  if not more.  This book was one of the best fiction books ever written as  far as I am concerned.<br />It is so easy for the fiction author to fall into  a trap and write the same old news, sometimes in a tired, but different  way. These books are not interesting.  Any author who can offer a breath of  fresh air to the genre recieves my hats off, and this is due to jeffrey  Archer.<br />This book isn't typical at all, the plot twists are entirely  tough to predict,and even though the ending should have been a forgone  conclustion (the hero winning) it was done in such a way that I was still  very much interested.<br />The basis of the story is a guy named Adam who is  led through many adventures because of an archaic note he got from his  fathers will.  This letter to his father was written in german, and in  trying to get it translated the adventure begins.<br />His journey and  escapes follow across most of Europe, and the action never stops.  Somewhat  like a James Bond flick, but 100 times better, and in book form is what I  would compare this exciting read to.<br />Read this book, and when you are  done, read all the rest of Archers books, you will enjoy each and every one  of them.
0716723980|3.0|This is an excellent reference book, but a poor text for students learning about inorganic for the first time.  The discussion (Chapter 4) on molecular symmetry and point groups is INSANE.  The prof who taught the  course provided a number of supplementary materials on point groups,  probably because this chapter is so flawed.  The second part of the text is  somewhat better than the first...  Personally, I learned a lot from the  discussions in the Guide to Solutions manual that accompanies the text; if  I hadn't had that, I'd have definitely received a lower grade in the class.  Overall, an average-level textbook.
B0000062FL|5.0|There are several great Santana albums, but I think this is undoubtedly best. As another reviewer says, it sounds very live;  it is not a \\"pieced together\\"-sounding studio album. The way the first half  flows together is mesmerizing -- seamless transitions of great music.    The best tracks include \\"Singing Winds\\", \\"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen,\\" \\"Incident,\\" \\"Oye Coma Va,\\" and all the live tracks. This is a must-own if you are a fan, and if you just got onto Santana with Supernatural, then get this next; otherwise get it first.
0891416811|5.0|I first stumbled across this book when I was about 12 years old.  That was 20 years ago and to this day I still haven't forgotten the chaos and horror that the writer described.  Certain parts of the book are seared into my  memory.  I still remember a part when they are running from fire dragging  their friend Jamie who is quickly expiring from wounds.  It is a testimony  in itself that I still remember the name of his friend after having read  this book so long ago.  The paratroopers who dropped behind Normandy  displayed a selflessness that is non-existent today.  This book shows that.
0380788624|5.0|It took me a few pages to get into Cryptonomicon because it's a fairly complex affair: Three main narratives (four if you count Goto's story) intertwined with each other. Two are set in WW2, one in the present. All of  them operate on a truly global scale. It must have been tremendously  difficult to write this book and Stephenson has done an awesome job! Once I  found my way into the story, it was a rollercoaste: the suspense keeps  building up and the book is full of action, ideas, strange characters and  historical, geographical and cultural background. This book could have been  your three standard novels: One US Marines in WW2 action-story, one  historical novel about Turing/Enigma/Bletchley Park and one  Cyber/Techno/Finance thriller about building a data-haven in SE Asia and  creating a Virtual Currency. But then, even with three books you would  still be missing the vicious humour of the story: In parts it felt like a  cross between Catch 22 and a Ben Elton novel!
B000002X2B|5.0|This has always been my fave album produced by SF bands, it's a soul collective in a good trip, with moments of pure delight. It represent all the best and non-paranoic went out from that era, along with QMS'  &quot;Happy trails&quot; and Grateful Dead &quot;Live/Dead&quot;. Don't  miss it.
B00004SCX6|2.0|what can i say about this CD well it's kindof good...i just listen to like the same 2 songs over and over again...well alot of the songs on this CD kind of all sound VERY the SAME to me...well that is just my opinion go  ahead and buy it if your intrested into someone who can just dance...that's  all i think she can do b/c the kid has no voice...seriously....Lucky and  track 1 are the only songs i really listen to...but the other ones i was  hoping for more....alot more!
B00004RITP|5.0|Rattle's version of the Cooke edition of Mahler #10 with the CBSO is one of my favorite classical CD's.  I was delighted to see the release of this live recording with the Berlin Philharmonic.  Though Rattle's approach is  fundamentally the same, there are some fascinating details to uncover - the  opening viola theme is a bit slower, more dramatic; there is some extra  persussion here and there, the drumbeats that open the final movement are a  bit more subdued, more appropriate for the funeral march on which this  element is based.  Does it shed significantly more light on this great  music?  Probably not....but it is always worthwhile having another version  of #10 available, and when the conductor is Rattle and the composer is  Mahler, it makes this a very valuable and worthwhile experience indeed.
B000002BFL|5.0|1995: Clinton is president, The New Economy is booming, S.U.V.'s & the internet highway are THE new modes of transportation.  America is as confident and powerful as it's ever been...but Bruce Springsteen is not optimistic.<br />\\"The highway is alive tonight, but where it's headed everybody knows...\\" he sings. After Enron, WorldCom, a recession, 9-11, a war or two, and a *new* George Bush in the White House, who can blame Springsteen for spending late 1990's biting his nails?<br />A very quiet but undeniably angry record, \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" is some of Springsteen's best songwriting, and his best work of 1990's. The storytelling and rolling melodies sweeps the listener away to the American southwest and into the hearts and minds of the desperate refuges, ex-convicts, wounded drifters, and lonely lawmen that populate the album's landscape.<br />This is an engrossing & compelling record, unique for the time period, I think. \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" highlights the dark side of America's new world dominance by telling stories about Americans left behind.  The consequences of the greedy, uncompassionate, and self-destructive model that America embraced & exported during the last decade of the 20th century is on full display here, and in Springsteen's hands it makes for gripping and powerful music.
B00004T1NA|5.0|I thought Porcupine Tree reached their highpoint with 1999's stunning release, Stupid Dream. Well, I may have been wrong since Lightbulb Sun is another excellent disc. <br />Like Stupid Dream, the CD is more  song-orientated. This is the only Porcupine Tree CD to date that doesn't  feature any instrumentals. That being said, there is some excellent and  extended playing on Hatesong, Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before  it is Recycled, and the 13-minute Russia on Ice.<br />Also, Steven Wilson's  guitar playing on this CD is superb, especially the solo on Shesmovedon.  The CD also features different instruments than in the past, including  banjo and hammered dulcimer (both played by Wilson) and guimbri and saz  (both played by bassist Colin Edwin). Additionally, Dave Gregory, formerly  of XTC, has done string arrangements on Russia on Ice, Feel so Low and The  Rest Will Flow, and the results are superb. <br />All in all, yet another  excellent release from a band most people have unfortunately never heard  of.
0156528207|2.0|I read this book (as an adult) since I heard it being so often mentioned alonside The Alchemist.  The Little Prince is no where near in the same class as The Alchemist and I was sorely disappointed.  This is truly a book  for small children only...any adult (or child for that matter) with even a  half developed brain will find this book ambigious, boring and even a  little insulting...on the upside it reads quickly and the tedious pain is  over quickly.
6303148352|4.0|Good plot, good acting, bad SFX!  The speacial effects were average in this movie.  They looked a little realistic, but I thought it was odd that the rain was falling through the T-Rex.
B00004TWZF|5.0|Bring me the Frenchman ...!   Why have we had to wait so long for what is undeniably one of the most visually and aurally intoxicating films of all times? This film which pays homage to the world-famous free diver, Enzo  Majorca, deals with a subject matter that few could find scintillating.   However, Serra's score is both haunting and beautiful while the photography  is some of the best use of light and shadow in a colour film.  Whilst this  all sounds rather &quot;arty&quot;, there is a considerable amount of  humour and interaction between the main protagonists of Reno, Barr and  Arquette (not to mention a dolphin or two!).  Many will think that the  Director's cut is too long but the short version leaves you unsatisfied.   Best watched with ALL the lights turned off and the bigger the screen the  better (irrespective of damage to one's eyes! ).  Few films today can  succeed without graphic sex or violence of which this film has none. The  worst crime was releasing this film to the US market with a different  ending which misses the whole point of the film.  Thankfully the Director's  cut stays true to the original version. A cult film it may be - but it  stands at the number 1 position on my top films of the past twenty years.  It appeals to both sexes and is a must for anyone's library.  I have seen  it more times than most people could stand, why? - because it does not  depend on any one element to keep you hooked.
6304613199|4.0|This movie's FX were no better than the first, but the rest was waaaaaay better.  But is it some sort of rule that the first time the T-Rex attacks in these movies that it has to rain?  This movie's ending is a rip-off of  the ending to the 1920's dinosaur movie The Lost World (no relation to  Jurassic Park), exept instead of a Brontosaurus, they used a T-Rex.
B000002HMH|5.0|Well, I first started to listen to Load about '96 and just didn't like Metallica (Ahh how could I be so stupid), but my dad started to listen to them and I got addicted! I got Load back out from its dusty abiss and  started to listen to it, Man I was HOOKED. If you haven't listened to this  album then listen to the samples here on amazon, it is just the coolest. I  bout The Black Album and decided I like the more mellow side of Metallica  (I don't know why), but the black is still awesome!  Rock on and listen to  more Metallica!
B00003CXAT|5.0|Remember seeing early dinosaur movies? Bad animation, no plot, and terrible acting- the dinosaur movie had made an infamous name for itself in film history. However, when Jurassic Park first came out at the theaters,  the name of dinosaur movies was forever salvaged.<br />This movie is nearly  perfect in so many aspects- unlike traditional dinosaur movies, its plot is  very deep and involved. The entire plot is what would happen if man tried  to harness the power of nature, and the tragedy and horror that could  result. When Dr. Hammond, an eccentric millionair, invites two notable  archeologists, a lawyer, and an offbeat chaos theory expert to his new  Dinosaur theme park, no one has any idea what they're in for.<br />At first  the idea seems very nice, as the entire group, with the addition of  Hammond's grandchildren, begin to explore the park, amazed at the wonderful  creatures all around them. Things turn for the worse, though, when a  tropical storm blows in, and a gluttonous computer operator at the park  tries to steal some dinosaur embryos. In turning off the systems to disable  the alarms, the computer guy ends up turning off the power to the electric  fences that keep the dinosaurs in their pens.<br />Bad move.<br />The rest is now  movie history, as this brilliant and often funny thriller plays out. This  is a must have for a movie fan- Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best  films. The computer animation is revolutionary, one of the best examples of  this art in history. The plot and the acting are great too, making this an  incredibly strong and well-rounded movie.
0684874350|5.0|This is definetly the book to read if you are feeling sorry for yourself and a bit depressed. Frank McCourts touching true tale of his childhood is so sad and heartbreaking that it makes every day life in present day  America seem like a cake walk. This story really made me happy to be alive  and have such a wonderful upbringing, family and friends.
B00000INEX|5.0|We (my daughter, husband and myself) love this video.  We purchased it when our daughter was 2 months old and she loves it every time we put it on for her.  We prefer Bach to Baby Mozart and Baby Einstein.  Our daughter  smiles when she hears the creator's voice come on in the beginning of the  video and the smile stays on her face until the very end!  We can't say  enough good things about this video!
0451191153|1.0|It amazes me the amount of effort some reviewers have put into explaining the failings of this book. Simply, it is a book that combines the orientation to the world of a neglected three year old and the writing  skills of the average sexist high school student. Bravo.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney's new album, Oops!...I Did It Again! is just a great cd. The first 7 songs are all up-beat (except 5) and want to make you get up and dance. She made a real change in her music from the first album and I highly  recommend this great cd to everyone.
B00000373U|5.0|I asked for this album because a friend of mine so kindly told me that I was silly for loving &quot;Figure 8&quot; when &quot;Either/Or&quot; was so much better... and I have to thank him for this addition to my collection.   This album is actually the kind of stuff I like a bit more than the stuff  on Figure 8... Figure 8 was a bit too reviewer friendly it offered up the  correct dosage of pop-driven tunes... where as Either/Or offers the same  quality of music but none of it seems forced as the other album did.  This  album starts out strong, track two and four becoming my favorite songs  quickly, and ends on the same level of quality.<br />The thing I like about  Elliott Smith is that he has beautiful music... I know nothing about music  for the amount of music that I own.  I can play no musically instruments, I  can not keep a key while singing, and I am so off-tune that I look like a  fool dancing along to the songs that I do enjoy.  But one thing I like is  beauty in music, the nice dreamy beauty that people like Donovan gave us to  begin with.  Elliott Smith plays like he has been playing for years... like  he played with the likes of Nick Drake or Lou Reed.  He is amazing... and  this album has taken over my opinion of him. <br />The reason that I enjoy  this album so much is mainly because of track four, &quot;Between the  Bars&quot;, I was in love the moment I heard that one.  I saw it in my  head, like it was footage from a old 8mm camera... some stupid college film  class movie of urban love... like some beautiful painting from the likes of  Tamara De Lempicka with her brilliant red lipped beauties that look just a  bit sloshed and under the complete influence of their lover... it reminds  me of how much energy eyes emit (how eyes can tell the story of your past)  and how this man was singing to his lover that has tried to escape  reality.<br />This is an excellent addition to any collection.
B00000K3UR|4.0|Adam Sandler is great in Big Daddy. Not only is the movie extremely funny, but may bring you to tears. It is a great movie and I know I love it.
B000002H8F|5.0|This album takes you on ups and downs like you wouldn't believe... my boyfriend and I scream at eachother during &quot;Rock Music&quot; in my dorm room and we enjoy ourselves so very much.  I got this album at a  garage sale for around 50cents at some old ladies house... in the midst of  wool sweaters and gaudy lamps from the fifties this gem shined through  sitting under a pile of  romance novels.  To this day I have no idea why  this lady of around 80 had a Pixies album in the first place.  I am  horrible about getting albums if I have them on cassette even though the  quality is so much better and the fact that it is just so much more  accessible to use... so thank goodness the old lady had this cd.<br />The  Pixies have been a constant part of my life, they contribute just as much  as every other artist because they have been around for such a long time on  my shelf.  As another sister-inspired music addition this one was added  into my collection during my middle school years.  I tried my hardest to  get my very few friends into the Pixies in middle school, but they just  didn't understand.  We were all the out-casts but I guess we all had our  own little groove to fit into.  Audrey was obsessed with George in the  Beatles and she made us listen to Sgt. Pepper's at any moment possible.  At  the time I couldn't understand why anyone would chose to listen to  something that my father raved about, but I let her do her thing.  Then  there was Megan and she was into Aerosmith religously, and sadly enought I  took part in this little fad of ours.  And then I sat there at our table of  four or five girls, short and small with an awkward face raving about the  Pixies and no one listened.<br />So I sat in my bedroom alone, surrounded by  stuffed animals of my childhood and nail polish bottles of my preteen days,  listening to &quot;Velouria&quot; by myself.  Humming along, singing along  with the lyrics book propped under my drying toenailed toes.  No one  understood why I liked this band... &quot;You can't understand what the guy  is saying&quot; &quot;This is weird&quot;  or my favorite, coming from my  little sister, &quot;So does like the Chess Club listen to this  stuff?&quot;  She was a little brat as far as I was concerned, but I  laughed at that one... mainly because it was just an off-the-wall statement  to say.<br />So then I went through my days at my suburban high school finding  out there were others that liked the Pixies to the extent that I did...  they just didn't live around me.  The dead-beats that hung out at the punk  rock venue I went to... now they liked the Pixies and they knew all the  lyrics to &quot;Is She Weird&quot; just like me... and in between sets we  used to listen to the Pixies.. especially Bossanova.<br />Bossanova is my  favorite because I can tolerate it the most, I love all of the songs and  for some reason their are certain elements of Doolittle that are  bothersome.  So I danced around in between sets with John shrugging up and  down my shoulders and sang staring up at the ceiling as Frank Black sang  &quot;Your mouth is everywhere.  I'm lying in it.  Is she weird, is she  over me like the stars and the sun?&quot;  Ah the memories.<br />Then I went  off to college, lugged my box of a couple hundred cds and started stacking  them on the built-in shelves in the room.  My roommate was caught later  that evening browsing the titles with an awkward look on her eye; as I made  my way back to unpacking she apologized and quickly left the room.  I  glanced over the spines of my cds, too, trying to see what would cause  anyone to leave the room... and I was clueless.  She explained to me, after  we had gotten to know eachother, that she knew none of the artists that  were printed on the sides of my cds and she was a bit disturbed.  Not  everyone was like my roommate, though, there were others like the kids at  the punk shows that I so regularly attended in high school.  Others that  had extensive no-name band music collections... and others that loved the  dreamy vocals of the Pixies (or the screaming cries of other songs).<br />And  then I met Zach, and we used to dance around in my dimly-lit room screaming  lyrics along to the Pixies... and that is when that album was truly  christened.  I will forever remember Bossonova as music that let us unwind  at the end of the week... music that made me so very happy.<br />(And just  about every mixed tape I make has a song from Bossanova on it
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm not sure I should even put a rating on this album. It's beyond five stars; it's pretty damn near transcendent. Everything produced for OK Computer--the sounds, the melodies, the words, the rhythms, the harmonies,  the CD artwork, even the website--is amazing. But here are a few caveats,  anyway:<br />1. If you like your music all poppy and neat and pretty, chances  are you won't like this album.<BR> 2. If you can't stand flexible, warbly  voices and strange sound effects, chances are you won't like this  album.<BR> 3. If you don't like a good dose of surreality, despair and  black humor with your music, chances are you won't like this album.<BR> 4.  If you only like short, punchy songs with a clear hook, verse and chorus,  chances are you won't like this album. (You'll be pulling your hair out by  the second song, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;--guaranteed.)<br />I can  understand how and why some people think OK Computer is overrated. It's a  difficult, messy album; it can't be described by any stretch of the  imagination as likable, and chances are the sonic assault will overwhelm  you (sometimes pleasantly, but more often unpleasantly) the first few times  you hear it. But once you learn to listen to it, and I mean really LISTEN,  it's incredibly rewarding. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that  it's probably one of the greatest rock albums, ever. I listen to it at  least once a week, probably even more, and I'm always astonished at the new  textures and beauty I discover within the niches and folds of the music. If  you can appreciate people like Beck or Pearl Jam, you might want to check  OK Computer out. But ultimately, comparing Radiohead and the music they're  making today with anything else is an exercise in futility because they've  evolved into one of the few musical entities that can be labeled as truly  original.
0790734591|4.0|No guilt involved. A snappy, violent, very fast moving action fest. Full of one-liners, fast editing, and &quot;tough - guy&quot; humor. I wouldn't let my children watch this movie, but I like it. Especially late at night  when I want explosions, gunfights and not to much intellectual baggage. In  my opinion this is one of Bruce's best flicks.
B000021XR5|5.0|STP is back in fine form! I've been a fan of these guys ever since I first heard &quot;Plush&quot; and they've never let me down since. &quot;No. 4&quot; rocks and wails, and then manages to astound you with delicate  melodies. The uncannily (and a trifle eerily) Doors-reminiscent  &quot;Atlanta&quot; is a prime example. And the catchy &quot;Sour  Girl&quot; will stick in your head, especially the &quot;what would you  do?&quot; tagline. &quot;I Got You&quot; bounces playfully, and tracks like  &quot;MC5&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; drive with STP's signature thrash (in  the vein of &quot;Vasoline&quot; or &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;). It's great  to see at least one band that survived the '90s with their linup intact.  Get this one, you won't regret it.
B00000J2L7|5.0|oh my gosh this movie is excellent.  I wish I could give it more stars.  I had seen it before when I was about six or seven but I didn't quite understand it then so I rented it again yesterday and this is possibly the  best film I have ever seen.  I think my parents thought I was crazy propped  up in front of the TV at 1 in the morning laughing histerically.  The  general is what made me laugh the most.  His facial expressions are genius,  now that's great acting!   And when he slaps his belly while talking on the  phone, I laughed so hard.  I love this because the situation is so  incredibly rediculous and helarious.  He's angry because we need our  precious bodily fluids so he bombs russia, that's brilliant work right  there.  If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother renting it..just buy  it right away.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I had given up on Maiden a long time ago.  That is , until I heard &quot;The Wickerman&quot; about two weeks ago on the radio.  I'm listening to this really cool song and thinking; Man! this sounds like the great  Maiden of the '80s!  The following day I bought the album.  UNBELIEVABLE!    It's far and away their best effort since the mighty  &quot;Powerslave&quot;.  Reuniting all the original members must have  revived that unexplainable and unparalleled chemistry that made them great.   Janick adds some nice flavor to the original masters, and Bruce's pipes  sound better than ever!  Somehow, they've managed to sound fresh and new  while still maintaining that classic Maiden element.        To all the  sceptics out there who gave up on them like I did, I beseech you to give  them another chance!  If you do, I think you'll feel the same way I do.  If  you don't, you'll be depriving yourself of some truly excellent music.
B000002HPV|4.0|I got this album due to everyone and their mother telling me how incredible it is.  Being a huge fan of intelligent, thought-provoking, challenging, and talented woman I decided to buy this CD.  Although my  first listen didn't exactly bring me to my feet, the album ultimately  persists in your mind if you give it a chance.  The music is very  different, and at times, tough to handle, but to appreciate Bjork one needs  to open their mind to different musical styles and experimental music.  In  the end, this album becomes something very satisfying and impressive.  I  now plan to purchase her prior albums, along with getting her video  collection at the same time.  I guess she's made me a fan. :-)
B00003CWL5|5.0|I've now seen American Beauty three times and feel like I could watch ten more times. There is so much to love about this film. Both Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning are fantastic in the film. The soundtrack is also excellent. Thomas Newman (I've never heard of him before the movie) does a  lot of the music and it's great. The dialogue is superb and there are  almost no scenes that are unenjoyable. Truly an entertaining film, as well  as one rich in theme. You will laugh and cry and think many times  throughout the film. My only complaint would be that we didn't see Lester  pre-midlife crisis enough to sympathize with him more. They sort of just  plunged right into his troubles without establishing how his wife mistreats  him, how work [is lame], how he is distanced from his daughter. But a minor  complaint. [View] this movie today!

B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam's new album, Binaural, is good album.  It is a definite improvement over No Code, which I was disappointed with, and a little better than Yield, which I liked pretty much. This album starts off with  two high-energy songs, Breakerfall and God's Dice.  These are not great  songs, but they are definitely good.  Pearl Jam have often started their  albums with high-energy songs (Last Exit, Spin the Black Circle, Go,  Animal, etc.), and it usually seems to work.  It does here as well.  The  third song, Evacuation, is more annoying than enjoyable.  I have already  gotten in the habit of skipping it when I am listening to the CD.  The  fourth song, Light Years, is one of my favorites.  It is one of those  softer songs that usually end up being the better songs on Pearl Jam's  albums.  My friend was listening to the CD for the first time the other day  and she loved this song.  The fifth song, Nothing as it Seems, is the radio  single.  It is nothing compared to previous hits by the band, but that  doesn't mean it's a good song.  It reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd.  The  next two songs, Thin Air and Insignificance, are again good songs, but not  great.  After that, the rest of the songs are okay.  Grievance is a protest  against the WTO (at least that's what the other reviews say, it doesn't  actually mention the WTO in the song) and it's pretty good.  There isn't a  lot of flow to it, which is why I don't like it a lot. The bottom line on  this album is that you won't like it if you're expecting Ten or even the  Last Kiss single.  It's not a pop album at all.  In fact, many of the songs  sound as if they were put together during a jamming session.  There isn't  the conscience composition that made Ten so great.  I think it's more  similar to Vitalogy than any other album, but it doesn't have that raw edge  that Vitalogy had.  So if you like the direction Pearl Jam has gone and  you're not expecting an album like Ten, I think you'll enjoy this one.   Especially ifyou're a Pearl Jam fan.  Then I'd recommend you get this one.   By the way, I bought this one having only heard a live version of Nothing  as it Seems (and I wasn't really impressed with it either) and I wasn't  disappointed at all.  But it doesn't have consistently good songs, so I  give it a rating of 4 stars.
0767903854|5.0|..and that's all Bill is saying, with his customary accessible erudition and likeable humour.  As an ex-Pom, now besotted with this interesting country, I read it aloud to my (African) husband sitting on a patch of   beautiful coastline in Sydney. We were vastly entertained and informed.  We  hugged ourselves with glee anew at having discovered some of what Bill  discovered, and were inspired to discover the (much) more we have not.  We  put it on our present list for all our US and UK friends who still don't  understand why we are here. We hope Bill comes back and writes some more,  as he so clearly wanted to.Read this book and I defy anybody with more than  a modicum of adventure in their soul not to want to explore this VERY  interesting country.
B000002UA5|4.0|The live disc of Ummagumma -- as many have said -- is worthy. The focus of this review, however, is on the studio portion of the album, a unique slice of Pink Floyd musical history that true fans will dig.<br /><br />Ummagumma's studio disc was a harmonious attempt on the part of each Pink Floyd member to flaunt his various skills. And although these guys were on the same wavelength throughout, some just had more talent than others. The album leads off with a stodgy instrumental, \\"Sysyphus,\\" written by keyboardist Richard Wright. If Wright's intention was to begin the album like a funeral dirge or the start of some cheesy 1950s horror movie, well, he succeeded grandly. Soon afterward, Wright's muffled, rambling, tuneless piano interlude kicks in, coming off like some wannabe classical piece that doesn't know where it's going. Wright's \\"Part 3\\" is no less tedious, a hodge-podge of noises that are even more forgettable than parts one, two and four. Still, though the music is disjointed and painfully un-melodic, it paves the way for the \\"there's-a-method-in-the-madness\\" style of future, stronger Pink Floyd albums.<br /><br />Roger Waters fares better on his pieces, \\"Grandchester Meadows\\" and \\"Furry Animals,\\" the latter of which bizarrely (and un-ironically) features a bunch of rodents performing vocals. Nature is a definite theme on this disc, as birds, bugs and small animals incessantly chirp away during Waters' segment. \\"Grandchester Meadows\\" is an obscure gem in the Floyd catalog, one of the most subtle, laid-back tunes you'll ever hear. The heavenly guitar picking is barely audible, and Waters' smooth voice is practically right next to you. The maddening animal sound effects on the following song give way to Waters' cockney British rambling, and it's actually one of the more humorous Pink Floyd tunes out there.<br /><br />David Gilmour finally provides some much-needed melodic relief on the intro to his great portion, \\"The Narrow Way,\\" as he strums a pleasant acoustic piece that is as daydreamlike as Waters' earlier song. For some reason, though, he ventures into generic Black Sabbath-like territory on \\"Part 2,\\" simply a churning riff filled with the odd surrounding noises his bandmates so loved. Thankfully, Gilmour's \\"Part 3\\" is probably the best song on \\"Ummagumma,\\" another mellow tune that boasts his great voice and outstanding backing vocals.<br /><br />Save for the fairy tale flute at the start and end of Nick Mason's \\"Grand Vizier's Garden Party,\\" the rest of this disc is an empty mess, just a bunch of tedious electronic drums fading in and out and lulling spaces that make Richard Wright's earlier attempt at music seem masterful. Instead of going it alone, Wright and Mason should have stepped back and assisted their other two bandmates in writing better material the whole way through.<br /><br />Some of these sounds are priceless, forgotten gems in the Floyd catalog, during a period in the band's career when no one was sure which way it would turn. The studio version of \\"Ummagumma\\" is a worthwhile venture, but it's also an acquired taste. If you're willing to sit down and discover how this band sounded more toward the beginning than the end, then this is an interesting album.aydreamlike as Waters' earlier song.

Then: Tommy - The Who; Thick as a Brick - Tull; Led Zeppelin 4; Sargeant Pepper - Beatles; The Wall - Pink  Floyd; Close to the Edge - Yes; Heijara - Joni Mitchell; Electric Ladyland  - Jimi Hendrix;  Blow by Blow - Jeff Beck.  You might just stay sane.
B00001R3GI|5.0|From the first &quot;Oh yeaaah&quot; to the last &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; Exile on Main Street stands as the greatest rock and roll album ever made. Buried with in it's four sides, it touches every emotion and every genre  all in that classic stoned out fuzzy sound. What I took from this album was  an interest to go further back and study the musicians who influenced the  Stones and their sound to date...i.e., Gram Parsons Jimmy Reed and John Lee  Hooker. Do your self the favor and add this album to your collection. It  won't be complete until you do...  Suggested Tracks: Casino Boogie, Torn  and Frayed, Sweet Black Angel, Let it Loose and Happy
B000002UJQ|5.0|I work in a boring job filing papers to pay my rent so that I can go to college instead of living at home. At work I am always listening to a cd, and for over a year this has been the one I look for almost everyday out of  my rotating 50 case holder to pick me up when I need that midday boost.  This cd is like watching 2001, the more you think about it and get lost in  it, the more you realize there might not ever be something as beautiful and  multilayered to be made in your lifetime. I cherish this cd over all of the  cds I own, and would definately be unemployed without it.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I love this CD. I have owned it since it was released and while I may have grown weary of &quot;Doo Wop&quot; after it was played constantly on the radio and MTV, I love almost every track.<br />If I had any complaint it  would be that the interludes are really distracting. I think I may be in  the minority here but I'm ok with that.<br />Anyway, I can't wait to hear more  from Hill. I am so impressed by this album. She is a talented artist.
0684833395|5.0|This is a masterpiece of a novel, one of the highlights of the last fifty years in literature.  One of the saddest, funniest, most inventive books of all time.  It's as creative and whimsical as Lewis Carrol, but set amidst  the horrors of war.  It's hard to find a book so original, so  unprecedented, so clear in its convictions and message.  A must read for  everybody.
B00000JCB2|2.0|I will freely admit that I like Limp Bizkit.  I think they are one of the bands that has caught people's eye and started to bring metal back to the forefront of American music.<br />That said, I think their records are  hit-and-miss.  &quot;Significant Other&quot; perfectly fits what I'm  talking about.  It starts off well, with &quot;Just Like This&quot; and  &quot;Nookie&quot;.  The latter, by the way, is one of the best pop-metal  songs ever written in the history of music.  Catchy yet relentless, dynamic  and crushing, &quot;Nookie&quot; is radio-friendly and a headbanger at the  same time.  Make no mistake, &quot;Nookie&quot; is Limp Bizkit at their  finest.  The awesome tribute to a bad day, &quot;Break Stuff&quot; keeps  the volume turned up, and the listener suddenly feels like the album is  gonna rock hard and fast the whole way through.<br />It doesn't.  &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; is weak and feels trite.  &quot;Nobody Like  You&quot; is marginally saved by Jon Davis' vocals, but the song is almost  painful to listen to because Davis is a far better vocalist than Fred is.  &quot;Don't Go Off Wandering&quot;, &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;No  Sex&quot; are throwaways, uninspired lyrically and boring  musically.<br />There are a few other good songs, or songs with good parts.  &quot;I'm Broke&quot; is one such, I always crack up when I hear that one.  Strangely, the chorus reminds me of Jane's Addiction, not something I can  say about many other bands.  &quot;9 Teen 90 Nine&quot; is the obligatory  song paying tribute to the turn of the century (glad THAT's over), but it  also has some great parts, especially towards the end. Like the album,  though, it is up and down, and the pace of the song between choruses is  ruined by the syncopated verses that are slow and uninspired lyrically.  &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; is a lackluster &quot;old school&quot; rap track  featuring Method Man, whose rapping and writing skills so outstrip Durst  that I can't listen to the song anymore.  For lessons on successfully  collaborating with rap artists, I point Fred to Korn's &quot;Follow the  Leader&quot; and the soundtrack to &quot;Judgment Night&quot;.  &quot;N 2  Gether Now&quot; does not work, and the chorus (&quot;Shut the f***  up&quot;) is pointless and moronic.<br />The album as a whole feels rushed,  like the band was under huge pressure to speed a more palatable second  album into the stores to eclipse the blistering power found on &quot;Three  Dollar Bill, Yall$&quot;.  Instead, &quot;...Other&quot; feels like a  lackluster effort (even though it's gonna go n platinum), and not even the  smattering of bright spots can save it.<br />Another issue I have is all the  garbage that is packed between many of the songs.  Things like hidden  tracks and 1 minute or 30 second &quot;experimental&quot; songs  (translation: messing around while bored in the studio) were once kinda  cool, but everybody's done it now, and all it does is serve to make the  album flow poorly.  This album is handicapped particularly, because the  pace of the album overall stumbles even without the additional noise  between tracks.<br />All in all, I think this album is similar to the first,  the handful of songs that are good would have made a killer EP.  The album  is difficult to enjoy and shows that Limp Bizkit is far less talented than  many bands out there including Korn, (hed)pe, Machine Head, Papa Roach and  others.<br />Just goes to show that talent doesn't always sell records, but an  image and an attitude usually will.he song anymore.

0694517992|4.0|Robinson, is so very good at what he does. I found this an interesting read with well developed clearly defined Villians &amp; Heros. Great info on Subs, Politics of the not so cold war of the &quot;future&quot; Is this  our &quot;Brave New World&quot;. I won't be all that surprised, after  reading this book. Fiction? or 1 Possible Future? I had a hard time pulling  myself away, so I could add a bit of sleep to my life.
6305807043|4.0|I hadn't heard a lot of the hype for or against this movie, but the idea sounded interesting, so I rented it. I had really no preconceived notions of what the movie should be. Which seems, from some of these reviews, to be a good thing. I wound up watching it twice, once alone and once with my  wife. Both times it went along swiftly and did not drag ... so much for  those criticisms. There's just enough inventiveness in this movie to keep  it going, and yet avoid collapsing on itself. A lot of the credit for that,  I think, goes to the actors. In the wrong hands the characters could easily  come across as stereotypes or weird for their own sake, but Diaz, Cusack  and Keener especially pull through. The script, too, knows when to shift  gears, particularly from the parodistic humor of the orientation video (a  really dead-on spoof, mirrored at the end by the A&amp;E documentary spoof  - perfect!) to the Office Space-style workplace cynicism, to my favorite  moment in the film: Diaz and Cusack both jump on Keener at the same time.  The ride through Malkovich's subconscious is also deranged, but there have  been similar sequences in other movies. I don't see the film as a  commentary on celebrity since Malkovich isn't (one of the running jokes) as  well-known and recognized as, say, Bruce Willis would be. I think the  producers were exploring existential themes, but the main flaw of the movie  is they do too much exploring and not enough concluding. Issues are raised  but never really much more than that. Still, the ending is haunting ...  Craig, a pathetic ... really, willing to spend another lifetime  watching his lover through the eyes of her daughter, and then the surreal  shots of Emily splashing around in the water with that weird Bjork music.  There was a sadness there.
6304994540|1.0|Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are the key players in this movie. To me....they could not save this movie.  I found little humor throughout the movie...there are a few comedic moments but overall I had few laughs.  This  sort of movie might appeal to some, but not to me.  I highly recommend  renting this one first before you buy it.
B000002G85|5.0|THIS IS CLASSIC ERIC WITH SOME TRULY GREAT SONGS FROM HIS FIRST SOLO CD.THIS HAS THE GREAT SONGS AFTER MIDNIGHT,EASY NOW,BLUES POWER AND ONE OF HIS BEST SONGS OF ALL TIME LET IT RAIN.CLAPTON HAD ALOT OF HELP ON THIS CD  WITH PEOPLE LIKE RITA COOLIDGE,LEON RUSSELL AND DELANY &amp; BONNY.THIS CD  HAS BEEN NEWLY REMASTERED FOR GREAT SOUND QUALITY TO.MUST HAVE FOR ANY  CLAPTON FAN OR FAN OF GREAT ROCK MUSIC OF THE SEVENTIES.
B00004RHZU|5.0|My 3 most favorite songs on it are 1. Hiccup ( I love how she makes her voice sound like a hiccup when she says it!) 2. You Make Me Sick (Has very cool and catchy chorus!) 3. There You Go - Everyone knows this song and I like it just as much everyone else does! I liked all songs except 6,7, and  8. On those songs it didn't sound like they were prepared enough like the  others. There is a very slow song on it and that is Stop Falling but I like  that song alot (especially the chorus) and you are hearing that from  someone who doesn't especially like slower songs and that song is slower  than most slow songs but it is great! So I would recommend you go and buy  it right after you read this review!

B00000J6AG|5.0|if you have any passion for music or sound in general, and if you've ever sat down and melted into a song, you want this cd. i've never been one for harsh dance beats, sometimes what i find on moby cd's, but this album is  another world. the smoothness and flow of this cd - whether it be between  songs or at the climax of one individually - remove you from wherever you  are and take you somewhere incredible. it is appropriate for any and every  activity i can imagine - but i personally like playing it on high volume  while i'm doing any kind of art. makes the moment that much sweeter and  more intense. i recommend it with all of my little heart.
B000002JS8|5.0|Seems like I kept giving 4's to most the Bon Era albums, that was because they were extremely solid but were missing that little something.  This was the complete gem of Bon's era.  You've got the pervert schoolboy  songwriting, blistering guitar, and screaming vocals!  There was absolutely  no song on here that I didn't enjoy.  Stand out tracks:  title track, Girls  Got Rythm, Touch Too Much, Walk All over You, Shot Down in Flames, If you  want blood, Beating around the Bush.  A must get for an AC/DC fan of both  eras!
0345389409|4.0|At first I found this book hard to get into, but gradually I accepted what Anne Rice was trying to do and was then able to go along for the ride.  The book explores many interesting ideas, and as usual the writing is full of  passion.  Not the most action-packed book I've ever read, but certainly one  that got me thinking.  Plus, it's always good to see a book with Lestat in  it!
B000031WI8|5.0|This is George Michael/Wham's greatest album. The tracks are chronologically listed, so you can see how George's songwriting and vocals improve with every song. The leather jacket bad-boys days were the first 4  songs. From &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; onwards, its their new clean look, and  anyone can note the incredible change from disco to just brilliant pop  tunes. Of course, Wake Me Up was the hit that launched their worldwide  success, especially in US. This album includes a new different and improved  version of the brilliant &quot;Freedom&quot;, a real catchy tune that Abba  would love to write and sing. Careless Whisper will blow you away as you  see how talented George can be. &quot;Last Christmas&quot; is everyone's  favourite Wham song I suppose, everybody I know has heard that one. Simply  Briliant!

B00003CX5A|5.0|called &quot;Sleepy  Hollow&quot;. Have You Heard of it? If not ,then get  going. This was Burton's big chance to show off his creativity .       Elfman scored up the scene with his loud notes. Depp was perfect for the  role with his boyish look , but Christina did't fit so well. This movie is  great for anybody who isn't well with horror movies , but is fond of funny  and maybe a little scary. See this movie!
B000002KKS|4.0|Credit must be given to Ozzy. If you like him or not you must admit he was highly instrumental in creating heavy metal and for that many of us are grateful. Another plus is that the first five albums he did with the band  1970 - 1975 were quite good as well. However despite all this (and the fact  that i'm a HUGE Iron Maiden fan and like the faster paced style of this  album more) I still have to put Heaven &amp; Hell at the peak of Sabbath's  long career. Dio is, quite simply, a much better vocalist then Ozzy ever  was with much better range and far more power behind his vocals. Even if  your not a fan of earlier Ozzy-era Sabbath you still might like this for  the much improved vocals and a slightly different and faster sound in  general.
0380002930|5.0|Alright, I'll admit, that I was not so enthusiastic aboutW.D. when I first learned I would be reading it. In fifth grade, myteacher, Mr. Beaty, was 'in-love' with this book. He would set some time from the day for reading us the story. We were allowed to draw pictures of the rabbits. I was only 10 at the time, so, I, of course wasn't happy when we were supposed to read a 400-page book. By and by, my whole class started to love it. I loved their words for cars (at which, as of this point I don't remember), and all the other man-made objects. In 7th grade, I was blessed when my teacher handed out the sumemr-reading list, with W.D. on it! (I was currently in a different school than I was in 5th grade) I just LOVE the book, and am happy about having to read that, I mean, it's better than reading A tree grows in Brooklyn alone, isn't it? :)
0792156684|4.0|If nothing else, Titanic is an excellent example of James Cameron filmmaking in action. In &quot;The Abyss&quot;, he films much of the action in a giant underwater tank (almost drowning one of his actors). In  &quot;Terminator II&quot;, he blows up a whole perfectly good office  building. And in &quot;Titanic&quot;, he creates a multi-million-dollar  replica of the ship...only to sink it.<br />What's not to love about this  style of filmmaking? Absolutely nothing...as long as the resulting film is  as good as &quot;Titanic&quot;.<br />This film has a great story to tell, and  tells it spectacularly, with a suprisingly human center. It would have been  easy for Cameron to just focus on the sinking of the ship (and blow up  things real good), but instead his focus is on how the ship's sinking  impacts the people on board.<br />And the sinking itself is harrowing,  spectacular and beautifully done, as it should be with a $200 million  budget.<br />Bravo!
B00003CWTH|5.0|I liked, &quot;Magnolia&quot; but even though it's 3 in a half hours it's good. The ending was, weird don't wanna give it away but Tom Cruise got a weird roll i've seen his recent films, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was ok  dumb ending. Well enjoy this movie.
0790729725|5.0|Ever wonder why people get into the Mob to begin with? Watch this film and find out. <br />It's a seductive lifestyle, but as Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) finds out, it's a life that requires you to screw your friends, destroy  your marriage, and live a lie.<br />And by the end of the film, even after  Henry is stuck in a nowheresville subdivision in the witness protection  program after losing it all, he STILL wants the mob life back.<br />It's the  power of amorality, brought into crystal clear focus by Martin  Scorsese.<br />Brilliant film, full of marvelous performances and wonderful  moments.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|Jennifer Lopez is no diva.  She can act, but not make music.  Her music is OK, but does not compare to the likes of Madonna, Celine Dion, or any other diva.  She has good backround music.  She isn't the best singer but she can  make wonderful dance music.  She is an awesome dancer, whether she's  dancing to pop or latin music, the music showcased on this cd.  She dresses  to impress, with every thing from a bikini to a tanktop and jeans.  She  should go back to acting, but this still is an ok dance, pop, adult  cotemorary, latin album.  I reccomend it only to some people who like latin  dance music.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I really liked Britney's first CD and bought this one because of that. However, the CD has been disappointing. I like &quot;Ooops!...I did it again&quot; except for a section in the middle where a dialogue was  inserted - it was unfortunately very fake and takes away from the song. The  rest of the songs are just okay. There are many dialogues inserted into the  various songs but all of them sound more empty-headed than anything. I am  quite disappointed. As someone who loves her first CD the second one does  not live up to the first. I do not believe I will buy any more of her CDs  in the future.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This was a touching story of a Jewish man, his Protestant wife, and their son in Italy during World War 2.  The family is forced to go to a concentration camp run by the Nazi's.  The man tells the son that it is all  a big game and the winner wins a tank.  It is a very touching love story  that has a happy and tragic ending.  If you want to find out the ending to  this movie I advise that you see it if you hadn't already.  You really  should see this.  I reccomend it to anybody but small children under the  age of 12 or 13.  It is a very touching and tragic movie, but it is great.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is stylized and philosophical.  It also moves very well and has good dialog.  There is an overall emotional depth I really appreciated.  Hero and villain are excellently portrayed.  Even the very textures and  colors of the visual aspect captured on film are gorgeous.  The only  problem I had was in the 'construct' when Morpheus is explaining things to  Neo.  They didn't need a reference to cold fusion, and should have further  elaborated on the scorching of the sky and the machines' inability to leave  the planet.  Other than that, it's very well done.

0780622553|5.0|Jeff Shannon is a moron.<br /><br />Theatrical Viewing:<br />This it the greatest film I've seen.  I experienced it the first week it came out in the theater, and on my way home was filled with giggling, weeping, and joy -- I was so happy Proyas hadn't compromised his artistic instinct enough to destroy such a vision.  Dark City deserves to be seen as a film, in a theater, and I  refuse to watch it on a television.  Roger Ebert's review of it has sustained my hope that not all movie critics are totally unlike me.<br /><br />Director's Cut:<br />09/28/10 Bluray<br /><br />I'm astounded how right on target the original cutting style was to what I'd wished it had been in the theater, where the cuts were a little too tight, too rhythmic, too MTV, too commercial advertisement in spots.  Too much brevity.  Not only does getting rid of that awful intro voice-over help (I didn't see that in the theater, as I came in slightly late as we move down into the city), but bringing back Jennifer Connelly's voice better suspends disbelief and the flow & development of everything is drastically, monumentally improved.  The story and concepts, admittedly some of them borrowed from alien abductions and noir-ized for artistic sake here, all are thoroughly fleshed-out, paced, and called back appropriately.  The rushed, abbreviated version was a truly great achievement, but this a mind-blowing &uuml;ber masterpiece.<br /><br />I did not experience any issues with sound, but I will say the Bluray is still lacking in what the theatrical prints portrayed.  There is some noticeable generational degradation and some video processing-induced motion blur in some of the footage used from the theatrical telecine, which appears to be from the same HD scan the original DVDs were downres'd from.  They seem to have just remastered that original telecine (not rescanned an interneg or interpos, let alone the original negs) with some unfortunate edge enhancement to further \\"spoof\\" its apparent quality.  It ends up looking almost embossed in spots, PAL-conversion-like motion blurry in others, and generally inconsistent in inherent fidelity of the visual information.<br /><br />Comparing the theatrical footage intermixed to the newer transfers of the added or extended footage that they co-exist with, you can see marked differences in fidelity from moment to moment.  It does look superior to the DVD, yet is still vastly inferior (not just resolution or visual dynamic range) to the brand spanking new print I saw in an enormous auditorium when it first came out.  The contrasts will certainly improve with plasma screens, OLED, pro grade CRTs, or if you make prints from this disk and show it in a pitch black room.  But there is more lost here than just what is the result of your budget LCD display.<br /><br />I would hope one of these days the money is spent to re-scan the negatives and do a new digital intermediary, digital composites of the virtual effect plates, and not only bring that out on Bluray (or whatever the standard is at the time) but back into the theaters.  This film never had the appreciation it deserved and this intended version is one of the few instances where the \\"director's cut\\" is not just some unnecessary, drawn-out indulgence that lacks elegance.  It had that elegance before it was tampered with.  Test screenings and executives meddling: for shame.  You cut and alter a film down to the lowest common denominator, and the result is less, not more.  Most people are tasteless, moronic sheep who would just assume gas you under Hitler's orders or be spoon fed Britney Spears & endless Michael Bay sequels for the rest of their lives.

B000002UAO|5.0|I couldn't believe how wonderful this CD was.  I was compelled by the music and knew that this could be the best Beatles album ever.  I will tell anyone who is thinking about buying this CD that it is worth your money.   It has hits like Nowhere Man, which is also on the recent Yellow Submarine.   It also has other great songs such as Wait, Girl, and What Goes On.  This  CD is a great addition to your collection of CDs and I would tell any  Beatles fan that this CD is the one to get.
B000002KHF|5.0|Everytime I play the song Moondance, I can almost feel the month of October in me, no matter what season I may be in--I have never heard a song that elicited that kind of emotion before---simply outstanding
B00004U8P9|5.0|I love this movie. It's spooky and funny and I love the costumes and all the fun makeup. You should buy this tape and watch it over and over.
0783244320|4.0|I have to say, I originally watched this film to see Ms. Weaver play a regular, pretty girl...something she doesn't often do....she was very sexy, no offense, and has the brains to play a pretty blond VERY well.  (Too  often in today's society we forget that it takes a very talented actress to  PLAY this type of blond.  And she looks great in the longer wig...)<br />I was  very pleased to find that this was an all around pleasing film...watchable  over and over again.  I'm not a Tim Allen fan, but all the actors were good  in their respective roles.  I would recommend this flim to any one, any  date, and any family....
6304169558|4.0|I really liked this film.  From the story centering on the characters played by Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, and their efforts to send new computer equiment into a tornado to try and develop an early warning  system, but running into many trouples and soul searching revelations in  the process.  Twister is a great film.  Buy it.
6305558167|5.0|I have seen this movie roughly 50 times.  It was only a week ago when I was able to watch the movie on DVD instead of my VHS tape, and let me tell you, it is an amazing difference!   It was like seeing the movie for the  first time!  So clear and bright and crisp, like a DVD should be.  It added  even more to an amazing film.<br />The music is what makes this film  wonderful, and I especially like the acting, although others seem to think  it is not acted well.  I enjoy hard-lined Sci-Fi movies, and this is one of  them....I hate junk and garbage like Xena, Hercules, or Dragonheart - all  those really, really bad Fantasy movies...this one permeates the viewer  with a &quot;Wagneresque&quot; taste, superbly acted by a superb cast.   Gabriel Byrne plays an awesome Uther, Liam Nieson in his first film, and  Patrick Stewart sports the bulging guns and actual hair!   (well some hair)   <br />The movie takes liberty with the tales and history, but it is serious  and moving, and conveys everything a good Arthur tale should.
0790729989|5.0|This movie is so incredibly disturbing because it is actually about  something: the sense of sin that the modern world tries to deny and  repress.  Brad Pitt represents the principle that so many nowadays believe  in:  the proper application of force against other people is all you need  to succeed.  Morgan Freeman knows better--it's the enemy inside you, the  enraged being that wants to smash the heads of his enemies, that's what  really needs watching.  John Doe is this death wish incarnate--he hates the  world and wants to obliterate it and himself.  Rarely have I seen a movie  that so stylishly presents a contemporary mood (just check out those  opening credits; you would think Trent Reznor had something to do with  them.)
0783235615|1.0|Hitchcock is a very skillful director even though he did not make a good character movie. In particular his suspense movies are enjoyable even if they are commercial.  The movie &quot;Topaz&quot; showed his limit(that  is,several scenes have tension,  but he did not describe character well)  Furthermore, he did not understand political situation well. Don't enjoy  Hitchcock's political movies. Instead of that see his suspense movies.
0802130208|5.0|As Andrei Codrescu points out in his new introduction to the 20th anniversary edition, this book could not be published today.  It's simply too offensive to contemporary feelings about sexuality, race, and politics.  The same goes for several other beloved comedy classics of the '60's and  '70's:  Mel Brooks' &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, the albums of Richard  Pryor, you name it.  And isn't that a sad comment on our paranoid,  oversensitive popular culture of the &quot;90's.
B000002GFT|5.0|Startling at first listen....seminal...groundbreaking...the album that started a genre (English folk rock)....all that.  But none of the talk really matters because the music's so darn good.  Forget Sandy Denny as the  best female vocalist there ever was, or likely will be.  Forget that some  make convincing arguments for Richard Thompson as the best guitar player  around.  Just listen to the songs and the way they're played.  Ancient  musical ideas from the British Isles, crackling with a new energy as this  excellent band spun their alchemy and produced their all-time best effort,  then split apart (as if they knew that that line-up couldn't top the album  they'd just recorded).  Openning with &quot;Come All Ye&quot;--a rousing  troubador come-hither for the audience to follow as the band links  wonderful songs one after another.  Tempos and moods shift--some sparse and  lonely, like standing alone on the moors too late at night and too far from  home (&quot;Reynadine&quot;), some menacing and stabbing with full use of  rock instrumental dynamics to hammer home the dark side of an old English  folk tale (&quot;Tam Lin&quot;), some delicate and heartbreaking, like a  last goodbye that won't be helped (&quot;Farewell, Farewell&quot;).  And  don't forget the dance medley (which has remained a stable of the band  through all its incarnations)--stringing muliple old jigs and reels  together in breakneck bash-outs, deftly played on rock instruments for the  first time by anyone (yet sounding like it was old-hat to the players!).   This album is a masterpiece from start to finish, with no weak spots of any  kind.  Desert island discs have been done to death, but when they bury me  with the 10 discs I specify in my will, you better believe this one will be  on the list.  When the heck is the digital remastered version coming out!
0316777722|4.0|This collection contains what may be the funniest piece Sedaris has yet written, &quot;You Can't Kill the Rooster.&quot; It's about David's feisty, incredibly foul-mouthed brother and the touching relationship he has with their father. The first time I read it I nearly killed myself laughing (Paul Sedaris sounds like Daffy Duck crossed with a hardcore rapper.) Pure greatness.
B000021YCI|5.0|How can you go wrong with this CD.  It was the crown jewl in a decade of 70s blues/rock.  Favorite tracks on this album &quot;A Fool For Your Stockings&quot;, &quot;Manic Mechanic&quot;, &quot;Cheap Sunglasses&quot;  and &quot;I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide&quot;. It also featured the #34 Billboard  hit &quot;I Thank You.&quot;  This album made room for the &quot;El  Loco&quot; album to follow.  The last before the 80s new wave phase of ZZ  Top's career set in.
B00003CWNR|5.0|Toby McGuire is a fine young actor and absolutely superb teamed with the great Michale Caine. The supporting cast of the film is composed of many familiar faces, and each adult and child did a fine job.<br />The story is set  in an orphanage in New England sometime early in the 20th Century.  Unlike  some &quot;film&quot; orphanages, this one is run by caring adults. One of  the strengths of the film is that it accurately portrays the real sorrow of  being an orphan, which sooner or later we all are, but which is  particularly hard on children. The staff at the orphanage compose an  extended family of sorts, but new children are coming, and old friends are  leaving, and there is little continuity or security. And, there is always  the hope that tommorrow some beautiful couple will choose you for their  child.<br />Michael Caine, the loving doctor and surrogate father who heads  the orphanage staff is also a doctor who performs abortions. Every girl who  comes to the orphanage pregnant has the option of having the child or  having an abortion. This film has been described as &quot;pro-choice&quot;  and that's too simplistic. It doesn't advocate abortion as much as it  demonstrates that there are valid reasons why some women might need to  undergo this proceedure. It is a complex film, not for the faint of heart.<br />In a subplot that actually &quot;explains&quot; the final turn of the  main character's life, a parent behaves irresponsibly toward his daughter.  I found his behavior disgusting, and I found him repellent. This event was  critical to the plotline, but I hate to be reminded of it. I don't know how  it was handled in the book, but I think it might have worked better if we  had known the father a little less well.<br />This is a good film, but you  might rent it before you buy it as some parts are difficult to watch.
B00004T8RK|3.0|I must admit, I had high hopes for this album. With Matt Cameron (of Soundgarden) joining the PJ outfit, I expected major improvements to Yield. However it is more of the same from PJ, with some notable exceptions such  as &quot;God's Dice&quot;, &quot;Nothing as it seems&quot; and &quot;Thin  air&quot;. PJ may need to consider whether to quit while they are ahead as  the band do not seem to be able to reproduce the electricity of Vs, the  power of Vitalogy or the magic of No Code. However all is not lost PJ fans  as there is still enough here to make you want to buy this, and hope that  the next offering will be better.
B00000JCB2|5.0|i lovd this cd so buy it. it hasn a great mix of fred durst's aggressive voice and metal with creative dj parts that made it awesome!  BUY IT!
B00004TLMC|3.0|To tell you the truth, I really didn't think I was going to like this movie. I really don't like Stanley Kubrick's movies, the only one that was good was The Shining. (1980) Cruise and Kidman do great in this smart and  crafty movie which keeps you thinking what's going to happen at the end.  Very suspensful, very good --- Kubrick's best.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This album is a rehash of what she thought worked in the first album.  It is simply a case of &quot;It worked the first time so let's do it again&quot;.  The title track &quot;Oops I did it again&quot; is quite  pointless and sounds almost exactly like the &quot;Baby one more  time&quot;.  Ms Spears should not be afraid to try a new sound and mature  her music a little - and by mature I mean using new beats and new lyrics,  not using the same music and adding a few pert lines.  With the popularity  she has amassed she could certainly afford to test the waters a little. In  she lasts long enough to do another CD, hopefully she'll wise up and not  offer a discerning public this repetitive fare again.
B000002HMH|5.0|I don't care what any one says, long hair or short hair, metallica is still great. There are so many really good songs on here its unbelievable even though i could never beat master of puppets and the black album but  this album is a most have for anyone who likes metallica.  Some of the  greats are 2x4, Until it sleeps, king nothing, Hero Of the day, Bleeding  me, Ronnie, and Outlaw Torn . The odd thing is that i heard each of these  songs on the radion in my car more then once so that says something about  the cd.
B00000DC4A|5.0|What a voice. Bryan Adams has one of the most captivating voices I have known, and his songs are just as good. Because he writes most of them, his magic is put into them, and when you hear the song, you can sense that. I  recommend this album to anyone that likes good music.
0767802470|5.0|I saw this on VHS pan and scan the first time.  Bad Idea!  The DVD is stupendous...widescreen essential (especially for the internal sub scenes!).  The sound on the DVD with Dolby Digital is reference  quality...enveloping!  (apartment dwellers beware).<br />Others have reviewed  in great detail, so I mention only two scenes:  After the sub rises in the  Mediterranean, the exhileration in music and cinematic motion.  Then the  German crew singing 'its a long way to Tiparary'...as an Anglo crew might  sing 'Lilie Marlene'.
B000020617|5.0|This CD rocks from beginning to end. I know, it's an over-used expression, but to keep this review brief, I have to use it. If you don't get this latest CD from the Foo Fighters, you'll kick yourself later. I just got it  yesterday and it's all I'll listen to right now. I just can't get enough of  it. Trust me, you'll love it! ;-)
0800141709|5.0|I have read many of the reviews here, and most capture aspects of the military-industrial-political satire.  But do recall, please, the scene when Sellars is at Ripper's base and needs to call the President.  He needs  change to make a 'trunk call.'  &quot;Shoot the bloody lock off!&quot;  Sellars yells in a frantic sequence.  The army man, deadpanned, states  &quot;OK, but you'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola company.&quot;   Priceless.
B00003CX59|5.0|I'm not really into horror movies, but I couldn't resist this movie while it sat there on the rental shelf.<br />While on the way home, I figured this movie was going to be a rather cheesey, keep-the-gore-to-a-minimum and  don't try to scare the kiddies type movie.<br />I've never been more wrong.  It's rated &quot;R&quot; for a reason, and that reason is some of the  creepiest and most chilling story telling ever to hit your TV.<br />If you got  kids, don't let them watch this. There's no sense everybody in the  household having troubled sleep.
014028009X|5.0|Here in Brazil, English people are known by their circumspection, seriousness and bravery... And this book was a complete surprise to me, since it was written by and Englishwoman. It was a surprise because I founf  myself reading out loud with the dialogues, the way the plot was written  and the course the plot took. <br />         This book is a whole unidentified  world. The characters are people that at least once have crossed our lives  (if you are 30+, which doesn't mean you won't enjoy if you are under 20,  like me), or the lives of people we know. It's an enchanting book from  beginning to end. Now all I want is to read book number two: THE EDGE OF  REASON. I think it's as marvelous as the first one. Anyway, Helen Fielding  is a nice writer. You'll love the characters if you are a person of this  planet, there's no way to escape.<br />Marco Aurelio - contact:  deankoontzfan@hotmail.com
B000002OX7|5.0|\\"Who's Next\\" is definitely The Who's best!  Released in 1971 by arguably one of the greatest bands of all time, it followed on the heels of  the rock opera \\"Tommy,\\" and  Pete Townshend's  abandoned  \\"Lifehouse\\" project.  (\\"Lifehouse\\" was originally  intended as The Who's crowning achievement - a combination science fiction  film, rock opera, double album, and concert cycle, all connected to make a  statement.)  \\"Who's Next\\"  contains some of The Who's most  outstanding and famous songs, including the rock anthem  \\"Baba  O'Riley,\\"  \\"Bargain, \\"My Wife,\\" \\"Gettin' in  Tune,\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" all of them showing the  band's tremendous dynamism, versatility and musical maturity.  Superbly  intelligent lyrics, growling guitars, powerful, gritty vocals, and sizzling  percussion, piano, and  synthesizer, all converge to make every song on  this CD a rock masterpiece.<br /><br />What makes this digitally remastered CD  even better than the original album is the addition of five previously  unreleased songs from  \\"Lifehouse,\\" and the previously  unreleased, original version of \\"Behind Blue Eyes. \\"  These  songs, which include \\"Baby Don't You Do It,\\" \\"Naked  Eye,\\" \\"Water\\"  and others, are equal in quality to the more  familiar songs which make up the original \\"Who's Next\\" album.  Also included are very well written liner notes by Pete Townshend and John  Atkins, which explain the evolution of \\"Who's Next\\" from  \\"Lifehouse.\\"<br /><br />\\"Who's Next\\" is one of the landmark  albums of all time. It's also one of my personal favorites, and an  essential CD, not only for fans of The Who, but for all fans of rock and  roll music.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Man oh man, this is bad.  It's amazing that millions of people eat this up without realizing for a second that this is pure cheese with no substance whatsoever.  To describe the sound of Oops! I Did It Again, just imagine  your little sister banging on a Casio keyboard and singing insipid lyrics  in an off-key voice.<br />After listening to this album you realize that  absolutely anyone could be in the place of Britney Spears.  Since she has  no songwriting or vocal talent to speak of, people are buying into this  because of the images she projects to young people.  This may be a formula  for success, but when you analyze what's on the CD, what Spears has to  offer is of no relevance to fans of clever, artistic music.<br />That said,  you can expect the same synthesized drum programming, cliched lyrics, and  of course Spears' studio enhanced voice, which was all found on her debut  album.  Not a lot of time went into making this album, but then again,  Spears' fans obviously place image first, music second.  I doubt her fans  even respect her music, let alone listen to it.  How could they?  The music  is merely a promotional device to sell the image of Spears to teen girls  and boys.  This is only popular because the media is repeatedly exposing  people to it, but when the hype machine is turned off, this will be  completely forgotten.  Avoid it like the plague.
0425152251|5.0|&quot;Sophie's World&quot; is exceptional.  It offers a detailed overview of the history of philosophy as well as a delightfully innocent and intriguing mystery.  Very informative and eminemtly enjoyable.
B000031XCR|5.0|I think this album is really amazing. Some of the songs although very slow are made to be interesting  by the power of her voice. The album shows what an amazing vocalist she really is. Two of my favorites are an upbeat tune  called &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot; and &quot;I Want You to Need  Me&quot; a ballod written by Diane Warren that only Celine can make it  sound amazing as it is. My only complaint was that one of my favorite songs  &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot; was not included. That song was  what put her on the U.S. charts A number of other amazing songs were not  included either. This album is definately one to add to your collection.
B00004SVID|5.0|\\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" the live version of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" opens with a brief introduction by the master of ceremonies that immediately puts you in the show, feeling the anticipation along with the  crowd on hand; by the first chord from \\"In The Flesh,\\" you're there, on  through \\"The Thin Ice,\\" and \\"Another Brick In The Wall, pt. 1.\\"  There's a  stirring, ominous feel to \\"The Happiest Days Of Our Lives,\\" as it segues  into \\"Another Brick In The Wall, pt. 2,\\" which is highlighted by some  exemplary guitar work and keyboards.  On into \\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Sky,\\"  \\"Empty Spaces,\\" and \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\"  \\"Young Lust\\" comes across  particularly well here, followed by an eerie lead into \\"One Of My Turns.\\"   Next is \\"Don't Leave Me Now,\\" \\"Another Brick In The Wall, pt. 3,\\" and then  the drama begins to build as \\"The Last Few Bricks,\\" in the wall are placed.   \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" finishes the first disc.  There's a tinge of  desperation in \\"Hey You,\\" and the beginning of \\"Is Anybody Out There,\\" is  chilling; you can feel the tension of confusion mounting, as if ready to  explode, then it settles down during the rest of the song into a kind of  quite, calm acceptance.  Then Pink takes stock of himself in \\"Nobody Home.\\"   \\"Vera,\\" and \\"Bring The Boys Back Home,\\" leads up to one of the highlights  of the show, \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" a great song accentuated by David  Gilmour's ethereal guitar solo.  After \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" there's a  brief interlude during which a rather languid master of ceremonies  introduces Pink's show, which begins with the acerbic admonitions of \\"In  The Flesh,\\" followed by a dynamic version of \\"Run Like Hell,\\" another of  the highlights of the concert, which plays like a composite of the emotions  that permeate the entire show.  \\"Waiting For The Worms,\\" \\"Stop,\\" \\"The  Trial,\\" and \\"Outside The Wall,\\" finishes the second disc.    \\"Is There  Anybody Out There?\\" successfully captures the excitement of the live show.   The sound quality is excellent, and it was edited exceptionally well; the  sounds of the audience, for instance, which on many \\"live\\" albums amounts  to just so much wasted space, is kept to a bare minimum here, and the  segues are first rate.  This CD is a complete package, and includes a  booklet with candid comments from each of the four members of the band, as  well as a number of photographs of the concert.  There's some good shots of  how the completed wall actually looked. \\"The Wall\\" may well be the best  conceptual album ever made, by one of the most innovative bands in the  history of Rock, and this \\"live\\" version delivers big time, and in many  ways is even more satisfying than the studio album (which was outstanding  to begin with).  They waited twenty years before putting this together for  release, and you know what?  It's worth the wait.  This is one CD that any  serious collector, or anyone who just loves rock n' roll, for that matter,  is going to want for their collection.
B00004SU5J|4.0|I stumbled upon this cd by chance while in Germany. Frist I sawthe video to 'Rose Rouge' and loved it...but what cemented my decisionto buy the cd was the moment I heard 'sure thing' on a german radio station. I immediately recognized John Lee Hooker and wondered what on earth it was. I then discovered shortly thereafter that it was the musical stylings of St.  Germain...and I must say I am so pleased about this chance discovery because the cd is utterly brilliant. The cd is influenced by jazz and the blues, but has a very soothing, calming electronic touch to it. I highly recommend this cd and have already ordered St. Germains 'Boulevard'.
0767819594|5.0|Sarah Michelle Gellar (who is extremely sexy as a brunette) is great in this movie. Definitely up to the part, as are Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon.  Although many people find this movie to be a disappointment  as a remake, I believe it was done in the fashion that a GOOD remake should  be-it included new twists and turns that were not included in Liasons.
B000002GK1|4.0|This is a great CD but it takes a while to get used to the sluggish tempos and Chris Cornell's screaming.  I bought the CD after seeing the &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; video and have been a fan ever since.  It's  rare, but there is a 2 CD version of this CD that has cover songs of Devo  and Black Sabbath and a poem set to music called &quot;Somms&quot;. Check  it out...don't bother with &quot;Down On The Upside&quot;, their 1996 CD.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Too many listeners (and even critics) dismiss this album and give it 1 star, saying it is trash.  Even more people give it 5 stars saying its the best thing out there.  Problem is, neither side really offers an in-depth  explanation as to why it's trash or why it's awesome.  Well, here is your  explanation as to why it is awesome (a 4-star type of awesome, of course).  I'll be the first to admit that Fred Durst and his cohorts have all the  musical sophistication and talent of a turd.  Unlike Korn and Staind,  however, they have a hard, crunchy, heavy sound which gives their mostly  tuneless songs an intense energy that most bands only try to create.  Break  Stuff has to be the best 1-chord metal anthem in the world - it speaks to  our generation like no other song can.  And it has a musical and artistic  value of 0.  Does it matter?  Hell no.  Other songs such as Nookie and Just  Like This have a similar tuneless-yet-infectious quality that makes them so  fun to listen to despite their (lack of) talent.  This alone puts them near  the top of the nu-metal chain, but the album's main strength is its  diversity.  Next to the Deftones, Limp Bizkit mix their sound up more than  any other rap-metal hybrid.  There are those ear-splitters we all know and  love (or hate), but then there's a more subtle approach to tunes such as  Rearranged, I'm Broke and No Sex.  The strange thing is, these songs are as  good, if not better, than songs that fit their traditional sound. In short,  the state of music must really suck if a band as crappy as Limp Bizkit can  make an album, like Significant Other, that puts most other bands to shame.   Shallow music can still be good music.
0684800713|5.0|This is Hemingway's best novel and the best novel of all!  (Writing a review of it almost seems to tarnish its greatness.)  Hemingway's terse, impactful prose works in full force telling the tale of Jake Barnes and his  (impossible) love, Brett Ashley.  It tackles all the relevant themes of the  Lost Generation and captures the spirit of expatriot Paris and Europe.  In  my opinion, it upstages &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by orders of magnitude  including its portriat of post-WWI decadence, its writing, its romance, its  action, its story, and most importantly its realism.  AND IT HAS THE BEST  FINAL LINE IN HISTORY!   (There is more emotion and power in that line  than most 20th Century fiction rolled together.)  A magnificent read.
B000023X9W|5.0|Neil Young has had many a hit albums, but many that have flopped. Luckily this one is a success in my mind. This is Neil's album, he did it, and he's not trying to please anyone but himself. The first half of the album is ok,  with good songs &quot;Good to See You, The Great Divide&quot; but the other  three are mediocre. But, when you hear the second half, you will be  completely blown away. Neil's voice and lyrics are a great pleasure, even  if you took the beautiful melodies away. Together, he will paint a picture,  a wall, a mural, in your mind. Razor Love has wonderful percussive  instruments, Without Rings is moving, and Red Sun gives me beautiful  images. Horseshoe Man brings back a floodtide of memories, and Distant  Camera is just a beautiful song. It may not be his best, but it sure is way  up there. Something about his voice just soothes and calms me.
B00004TEX1|4.0|In 1979, Pink Floyd released their landmark album &quot;the Wall.&quot; The album was a story about an imaginary rock star who experienced feelings of isolation and is based on the life of the band's bassist/songwriter  Roger Waters who like the main character lost his father in World War  II.This is simply the studio album played live.But their are differences.  Two songs &quot;What shall We Do Now&quot; and &quot;The last few  bricks&quot; are additions not on the studio album. live versions of  &quot;In the Flesh&quot; and &quot;run like Hell&quot; are far past  superior than the original. If you're unfamiliar with the studio album I'll  fill you in. The music is very creative  and different. Some may find it  wierd the title track especially. Other songs are very radio friendly. If  you tune to classic rock radio often you are probably already familiar with  Comfortably Numb and Another Brick in the Wall part II. The sound quality  is great. I'll just put it at that. Another plus is the packaging with two  cd booklets, one for each CD. Each have alot of information in them   especially about the very  creative shows which involved giant puppets,  animated projections, scenes actually acted out on stage and of course a  giant Wall being  built up inbetween the band and the audience.This  set is  a must have for the Floyd faithful. Great songs, great packaging great  album.
B000003TA4|1.0|This CD sux! I cant believe that Nirvana got number one song of the 90's when they werent even together for half of them! &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot; is supposed to be this original song that amazed and inspired  people, well it is exactly like ANY pearl jam song, and yea i know pearl  jam's debut album came after, but it came out right before nevermind came  out and they sound exactly alike, face it u freaks Nirvana is just another  grunge band. If Kurt Cobain hadnt of commited suicide he would be a nobody  right now! the only reason he is remembered is because he is a loser who  killed himself! he is just an ordinary man who has no talent, just because  kurt cobain can scream and whine into a microphone doesnt make him special!  I gave this CD one star simply because there is no option for 0 stars!  complete and total disappointment!
B000026WE4|5.0|With so many great songs associated with this movie, I had to buy this CD, even as an import. The songs are some of the very best that have been written for Disney. Spoonful of Sugar, Jolly Holiday,  Supercalifragilisticexpialidociuos, Stay Awake, Chim Chim Cher-ee, and  Let's Go Fly A Kite are staples of Disney that just get stuck in your head,  especially because these songs are sop well known. I totally recommend this  CD to everyone!
0790751143|4.0|&quot;The Enforcer&quot; from 1976(the bicentennial year),the second sequel to &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;,(considered by many to be one of the all time classic detective films,Richard Schickel of TIME magazine,the late Gene Siskel,and The American Film Institute included),may be a better companion piece to the original than the second sequel, &quot;Magnum Force&quot;,(that's open to debate.) It came out at Christmas like the others and was an even bigger hit at the box office. The screenplay by the late Dean Riesner who co-wrote the original &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and the late Stirling Silliphant(Academy Award winner in 1967 for the crime drama &quot;In The Heat Of The Night&quot; and he co-wrote the disaster flicks &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; from 1972 and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; from 1974),has a plot similar to the original.Except this time instead of one murdering,kidnapping extortionist,Harry Callahan has to deal with seven of them. I first saw &quot;The Enforcer&quot; in the theater when it was first released(in the same place I saw both &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Magnum Force&quot;,my hometown of Arlington,Virginia),and the movie still holds up after more than 40 years.It became one of the most popular of the series.It was on both the ABC &amp; NBC television networks and was broadcast more than a half a dozen times,a sign of a ratings winner.A then relatively unknown Tyne Daly gives a believable performance in her role.Back then in the mid '70's she was one of the first women detectives portrayed on screen along with Angie Dickinson's &quot;Police Woman&quot; and &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot;.This was several years before she became known as Detective Lacy in CBS's &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacy&quot; back in the '80's for which she was an Emmy Award winner.In an article in TV Guide in August 2000,Ms.Daly revealed that she turned the part of &quot;Inspector Kate Moore&quot; down a few times because she thought the part was too cartoonish..However,Clint Eastwood talked her into doing it after he decided to expand her role and let her in on the action.<br />The picture was directed by James Fargo,who had been an Assistant Director on Clint Eastwood's previous film &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; that was released just six months earlier.He also had been Assistant Director on some other Eastwood films and two of then unknown Steven Spielbergs' earliest films,&quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; and &quot;Duel&quot;.And, he was Production Manager on &quot;Jaws&quot;.&quot;The Enforcer&quot; was James Fargo's first film as Director.The picture has fine cinematography and makes good use of the San Francisco locations. I missed composer Lalo Schifrin's jazz-rock fusion music.He was unavailable at the time.The late Jerry Fielding's jazz score is good though.Mr.Fielding had been nominated for an &quot;Oscar&quot; for Best Original Score for &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.Also, even though there were seven villians this time,led by a wacko Vietnam vet,an underground terrorist group who called themselves &quot;The People's Revolutionary Strike Force&quot;,(probably inspired by The Symbianese Liberation Army),I didn't build up nearly as much disgust for them as I did for that creep &quot;Scorpio&quot; in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;. Gene Siskel called &quot;Scorpio&quot;, &quot;one of the most contemptable louses in movie history&quot;.I couldn't agree more.That was Andy Robinson who played &quot;Scorpio&quot; in his very impressive movie debut.<br />Some more trivia for you,James Fargo went on to direct &quot;Every Which Way But Loose&quot; two years later in 1978,which was Clint Eastwood's biggest box-office hit,adjusted for inflation.Not adjusted,it's &quot;Gran Torino&quot;.The late actor John Mitchum who played Detective Frank &quot;Fatso&quot; DiGeorgio,Harry's occasional partner in all three pictures,is the brother of the late Robert Mitchum.He was a year younger.<br />The late Albert Popwell,who played the bankrobber in the famous scene in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; when Harry asks him if he feels lucky and he 's replies &quot;'I gots to know&quot; and a pimp who drives a pink Cadillac in &quot;Magnum Force&quot; plays the head of a black militant group,( probably modeled after The Black Panthers), in this one.&quot;The Enforcer&quot; was meant to be the final film of a trilogy.Like &quot;The Man With No Name&quot; trilogy&quot;.&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;,&quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good,The Bad and The Ugly&quot; back in the mid '60's,which made Clint Eastwood a movie star.&quot;The Enforcer&quot; was the biggest money maker at the box-office of all the Dirty Harry flicks.The film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel who belonged to The American Film Institute and had a movie review program for over 20 years,first on PBS,then for The Walt Disney Company once did a special about the Dirty Harry movies.They both were Eastwood fans and Ebert said &quot;That cop movies were a dime a dozen and cop T.V. shows were a dime for six dozen and the Dirty Harry movies were the most successful cop movies ever made.&quot;&quot;And Clint Eastwood was one of the most popular movie stars in the world.&quot;(John Wayne,Paul Newman,Robert Redford,Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds were also on that list.)That was back when N.A.T.O.,(The National Association of Theater Owners),kept track of the top box office attractions.Those days have long been over,there seems to be no more big box-office stars any more.That special was more than 30 years ago and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; with Eddie Murphy,&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;,&quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Robocop&quot; have since come along and made more money,However, none of them were any better and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was the first and the inspiration for all of those movies.I've had the Dirty Harry flicks in my collection since the '80's,first on Beta,then VHS and now on DVD and never get tired of watching them.robber in the famous scene in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; when Harry asks him if he feels lucky and he 's replies &quot;'I gots to know&quot; and a pimp who drives a pink Cadillac in &quot;Magnum Force&quot; plays the head of a black militant group,( probably modeled after The Black Panthers), in this one.&quot;The Enforcer&quot; was meant to be the final film of a trilogy.Like &quot;The Man With No Name&quot; trilogy&quot;.&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;,&quot;For A Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good,The Bad and The Ugly&quot; back in the mid '60's,which made Clint Eastwood a movie star.&quot;The Enforcer&quot; was the biggest money maker at the box-office of all the Dirty Harry flicks.The film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel who belonged to The American Film Institute and had a movie review program for over 20 years,first on PBS,then for The Walt Disney Company once did a special about the Dirty Harry movies.They both were Eastwood fans and Ebert said &quot;That cop movies were a dime a dozen and cop T.V. shows were a dime for six dozen and the Dirty Harry movies were the most successful cop movies ever made.&quot;&quot;And Clint Eastwood was one of the most popular movie stars in the world.&quot;(John Wayne,Paul Newman,Robert Redford,Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds were also on that list.)That was back when N.A.T.O.,(The National Association of Theater Owners),kept track of the top box office attractions.Those days have long been over,there seems to be no more big box-office stars any more.That special was more than 30 years ago and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; with Eddie Murphy,&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;,&quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Robocop&quot; have since come along and made more money,However, none of them were any better and &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; was the first and the inspiration for all of those movies.I've had the Dirty Harry flicks in my collection since the '80's,first on Beta,then VHS and now on DVD and never get tired of watching them.
B000007VCM|5.0|This is an incredible album by a band that had all the right tools at the wrong time.  &quot;Love&quot; has an edgier, more rocking sound than &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, but it taps the same vain of gothic psychedelia.  They weren't the Bauhaus, they weren't the Cure, they were the Cult, and  the could rock and still be dark.  An odd combination of The Doors meeting  Led Zeppelin.  If the opening riff to &quot;Love&quot; or &quot;She Sells  Sanctuary&quot; doesn't get your juices flowing, then nothing will.  An  essential...You won't be dissapointed.
068815333X|4.0|Prayers has all of the successful elements of Lehane's other books:  the chemistry between the characters, the plot twists, the sharp dialogue.  It all works...but the end product is just not as satisfying as the other  Lehane books.<br />The mystery this time around involves a former client's  apparent suicide.  It troubles Kenzie because he failed to return a phone  call from her shortly before her death.  The circumstances of her life and  the people in her life who sought to ruin it are the focus of the rest of  the book.<br />Let nothing in this review stop you from reading this book.   It's great! <br />One very important point:  DON'T READ THIS BOOK BEFORE  READING &quot;GONE, BABY, GONE.&quot;  The &quot;bad guy&quot; and several  other plot points of that other book are mentioned several times in this  one. You have been warned.
B000002H97|4.0|This Cd was great. Its really nice because its one of those CDs where you never really suspect that its getting old to your mind, listening to it over and over. Everytime you listen its better and better. I like this  album, especially Sad But True. When you listen to it, you can hear how  they partly sound like they're young, but then again this is new Metallica.  I guess........ I guess you have to hear it to know what I am talking  about. If you wanna discover the reason why Metallica is such a popular  band with diehard fans, maybe this will explain it.
0399226907|5.0|This book is simply great.  It has helped my son (2 1/2) with counting and identifying pictures and the concept of reading a book.  The different size pages (and the holes) make the reading fun.  Both of us still laugh each  time the caterpillar gets a stomach ache (sorry, are there spoilers for  children's books?).<br />I am convinced that this is the first book my son  will read to me from start to finish (BUT HE WAS STILL HUNGRY!).  He loves  it!
B000002HMH|4.0|great. Now they have me hooked. Pretty soon I am going to find myself looking for another Metallica CD to buy. This is a great addon to my small collection. Metallica is a great band, they don't brag about themselves,  and their music is straight from the heard and soul. This is a great CD, go  for it! buy it!
B000005S0D|4.0|Though Camel's later albums -- Dust and Dreams, Harbour of Tears, Rajaz -- are much more 'even', this album is one of Camel's very best. It has intense, brooding pieces like 'Vopos', which is builds layer upon layer  until its intensity demands the attention of all in the room; then again,  the closing track, 'Long Goodbyes' is one of the most beautiful pieces of  rock music ever recorded. Andy Latimer's lead guitar work at the end of  'Goodbyes' sounds as if he were stepping to the edge of the planet and  pealing off some interstellar paean to the cosmos. Breathtakingly beautiful  but scalding at the same time! Roy Wood's lead work at the end of 'If I  Were Made of Music' from Annie Haslam's solo 'Annie in Wonderland' is the  only thing that I can compare it to. Many of the other tracks on this album  are also quite good -- the openner builds the mood quite well, leading into  an exploration of many synthesizer sounds and a richly textured blend of  Andy Latimer's guitars and flutes. Ton Scherpenzeel of Holland's highly  praised progreesive band, 'Kayak,' brings in his keyboards and synthesizers  and his classical training is in evidence richly throughout this album.  This album has the pop edge of all that made Alan Parsons Project so  succcessful but also has the dark, brooding sensibility of a Pink Floyd  project. But this is no derivitive band by any means! Camel is Camel is  Camel -- and there is no other band like them. If you have Genesis, Pink  Floyd, Kansas, Renaissance, Yes or any of the other progressive bands in  your collection and you've missed Camel, you've missed a true prog  gemstone! These guys are brilliant and while this one is all over the road,  it's a rowdy and sometimes beautiful joyride through the countryside. Just  sit back and enjoy the ride! The view is glorious!
B00004SCX6|1.0|I'm guessing that some people just reviewed this without buying the cd, because, like me, they hate Britney! Well anyways . . . I think this album is a little better than &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; because, unlike the  songs on her debut, these onese seem a bit more . . . girl powerish. If you  noticed, most of Britney's hits all dealt with how sad and desperate she is  when she doesn't have a boyfriend. For example, &quot;Born to Make You  Happy&quot; &quot;Crazy&quot; &quot;Sometimes&quot; and, of course  &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;, all basically make her seem like a bimbo  who hasn't yet realized that she doesn't need to give up everything to a  guy. <br /> The song &quot;Oops! I Did it Again&quot; I like, because it has a  cool beat, and it also sort of sounds like she decided to play hard to get,  and let all the guys know that there's tons of others waiting for her, so  they better be good to her! <br /> One more thing . . . a bit of advice to  Britney: if you don't want to just a be a teen pop star, and still be  making music twenty years from now, then 1) learn to sing, your voice is so  off-key 2) write your own songs 3) wear less make-up 4) don't wear such  revealing clothes and 5) make your music videos have more than just dancers  and guys with their shirts off (well, actually, keep the shirtless  guys).<br /> And to all those record companies, if it takes an off-key voice  and so-so dance skills to be a hit, there's a million of us waiting for our  record deal!
B00004R99J|5.0|When I first heard about Pocahontas back in 1994, I knew Disney wouldn't do the story justice.  Boy was I wrong.  This movie has beautifully crafted visuals, strong leading characters, and wonderful music.  Though for me the  music works on two levels.  One, of course, the obvious &quot;Disney&quot;  songs, which get better or worse depending on the movie.  Colors of the  Wind is the best Disney song to date.  Also the pop song If I Never Knew  You blew me away.  And two, the underlying soundtrack perfomed by Alan  Menken.  The music was absolutly riviting, as it has to be to convey the  serious emotions Disney was going for.  A bit depressing in it honesty of  hate and love, this movie shows that animated movies can convey more  emotions than just laughter.
B00004T37H|5.0|I am 12 years old and I saw Princess Mononoke with my dad in Berkely.My dad even loved it!His favorite part was when the kodama mimiced Ashitaka.He also liked the way the kodama communicated.I loved the whole movie in general.I think Hayao Miyazaki's films are all the greatest!The dubbing was  especially good.The words all syncrinized with the lips.This is the  greatest action movie I have ever seen!
0790732254|5.0|A 4 person descent into hell that had me thinking of Sartre's No Exit line, 'Hell is other people'.  Burton and Taylor put on performances that set a standard.  Purely a dialogue driven film, the writing is beyond  compare.  Dancing nicely between horrific, funny, and sad with great grace.  There are very few films able to bring both screen writing and acting  together at such a high level.  The ending is particularly satisfying with  big question marks pocking all the themes.
0790736039|5.0|The movie &quot;IT&quot; is one of my favorite movies. &quot;IT&quot; has an intriguing story line, a great plot, suspence, thrills, and some scary parts. &quot;IT&quot; isn't that scary, but during the whole movie your on  the edge of your seat. It has Surprises around every corner. You start to  try and break down the story line, but you can't until the end of the  movie. If you buy this movie, you will be glad you did. Suspence, Thriller,  and a great story rolled into one.
0780021967|5.0|The 39 Steps is one of the earliest examples of Hitchcock's impending greatness.  For those who are casual fans of Hitchcock's more well-known work, the 39 Steps is an enjoyable addition to the Hitchcock compodium.   For those who are serious students of the director, The 39 Steps is a must  have work of brillance and an unequaled example of Hitchcock's artful  skill.  While the production values may not be up to the standards of  Vertigo or The Birds, the direction is flawless.  The 39 Steps is one of my  favorite Hitchcock films, second only to Rear Window, and well worth the  cost of the Criterion Edition.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I love this album. Seriously. It took a couple of listens to sink in, but now that it has, I consider this to be one of my favorite CD's. It's a highly unorthodox album; the sort you have to listen to in its entirety to truly enjoy.  It's so gorgeous, and every track has layers upon layers  built into it, so that each time you listen to it, you discover something  new in the music, some awesome little detail. There are these moments in  the music that are just so *beautiful*, that make me practically drop my  mouth open in astonishment, amazed that such sounds can exist.  And a lot  of it lies in the fact that Thom Yorke has one of the best male voices I've  heard--singular, and so capable of conveying emotion.  Some of his  stand-out moments on the album include the last minute or so of _Let Down_,  when he harmonizes with himself, or _The Tourist_--who knew that such  caustic lyrics as &quot;Idiot, slow down&quot; could be sung so  beautifully?  <br />So, like a billion other critics, and customers, I  recommend this album.  Duh.  Obviously.  There are obviously those who  won't enjoy it, and you can't really blame those people; it's an album  that's pretty far out there.  Perhaps a better choice for some is The  Bends, another album of Radiohead's that is a bit more orthodox and less  demanding, but still quite wonderful...
B000002AQQ|4.0|1994's &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was one of the biggest box office hits, gathering a generation's common memories through the eyes of (according to Robert Zemeckis' liner notes) &quot;a simple man in a complex time.&quot;  The music served as a secondary performer, Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning title  character acting as well within it as with any background or  character.<br />But Forrest is silent throughout this 2CD soundtrack set,  leaving you a primer of American signature tunes touching rock's first 25  years all too briefly: Elvis, Aretha, Dylan, Baez, Motown, San Francisco,  etc. Randy Newman's provocotive &quot;Mr. President&quot; and Gladys Knight  and the Pips' &quot;I've Got To Use My Imagination,&quot; are nice  surprises, as is Willie Nelson's &quot;On The Road Again.&quot;  Unlike  Forrest's box of chocolates, you know just what you're going to get with  this soundtrack. But then again, should someone born after the music be  moved enough by what's here to buy &quot;Lady Soul&quot; or &quot;Blonde On  Blonde&quot; after hearing these, how could it hurt? It's essential music,  but too little of it, in a disposable wrapper. And that's all I have to say  about that.
B000040OBS|5.0|For a band that really had no other electro-punk influences to draw from at the time of it's release, this album proves that they were WAY ahead of their time. Always minimalistic and staggering in its approach, the album's  power derives mainly from trance-inducing and repetitive keyboards from  Marty Rev and unpredictable, howling vocals from Alan Vega. Not bad sounds  coming from what mainly started with a broken down Farfisa organ and  cheap-o drum machine. And tracks like &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; and  &quot;Frankie Teardrop&quot; have proved to be timeless and greatly  influencial even by today's standards. The live tracks taken from different  shows of the era only prove how often controversial and violent this kind  of music was taking it's only influences from the doomed and claustrophobic  climate of the late 1970's in NYC. HIGHLY recommended and a leader of the  genre.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|I honestly don't know how anyone that appreciates good music can cut down this album. It's firmly situated in the upper-echelon of Maiden's best albums. The song writing is incredibly strong, despite some lack of  cohesiveness in certain tracks. People dismissing the lyrics as corny are  missing the point entirely. This is a CONCEPT ALBUM...it's trying to tell a  story, but too many pabulum-fed fools can't understand this. Maiden has  never been about delivering astonishingly deep music with reams of depth  and relevence to world issues or anything...it's about cheap-thrill metal  that sounds great. As always, Bruce's urgent vocals are incredible and are  sung with his ineffable intensity. Being a Maiden album, the music is  awesome and intricately layered, with their powerful signature riffs and  mind-bending solos. People complaining about synthed music are simply  ignoring what this album is about...the use of synthed audio adds to the  drama and the power of the story. It doesn't detract from the music in ANY  way, but it isn't thoughtless either. Unfortunately, certain mindless  people can't accept diversity and effect if it offends the sensibilities of  THEIR ideal image for Maiden. Every song on 7th Son is excellent...some  parts are slow, some are fast, but all are powerful. This is the pinnacle  of the band's albums.
1573225517|5.0|A touchingly drawn portrait of life in middle-class England.  A story at once sweet, sad, funny, and delicate.  Put it on your top 5 list of books to read!
B000001E7L|5.0|This was the first album I bought of the Cranberries.A friend of mine said she really liked Zombie.I don't really like Zombie that much ,but after I heard Ode to my family I decided to buy the album .At first you think some  songs are a bit weird but after a few listenings you will completely fall  in love with this cd.I don't think this is their best album.It has  beautiful lyrics,but some songs are a bit too serious(Yeat's grave).But I  will give this cd five stars because they are a fantastic band and Dolly  has a unique voice!
B00004T9UF|4.0|Normally I don't like rap music but I can't imagine it without him. Being one of the few white rappers out there, he's proved that he can run with the big dogs and this cd proves it. Not only are his lyrics clever, but  they're funny as well. If you heard &quot;Real Slim Shady&quot; on the  radio than you know what your in for. The only downside to this cd is the  song &quot;Kim&quot;. I don't know why he put it on there put it is the so  unecessary. I would never rap about killing my wife. Other than that an  excellent cd. Buy it. Now.
6303979882|3.0|I think the funniest part is the classic  naked boys part!  Funny funny.  very funny and realistic how the teenage boys really don't have a problem with their masculinity or genitals being seen until the girls come up, they they're caught bare naked in front of the opposite sex and literally shrink  up!  And even more so have to run around in the forest naked and are also  pre occupied with keeping [their selves] covered!  That is realistic and  funny!  Wonder what the young actor were paid to do that one!
6305633177|5.0|This video is awesome. It captures the early Metallica. The sound it's not so good, but if you want to learn more about their start... BUY IT !
0380788624|5.0|A great story that held my attention throughout.  An intriguing mix of cryptography, hacking (in the true sense), and WWII espionage.  Unlike anything else.  Stephenson's attention to detail and knack for storytelling  make this a top read.
B000003FD9|5.0|Janos Starker is extrodinary, and then you add Bachs most callenging and passionate work the cello suites.  Starker has an excellent understanding of the dymanics of Bach and the compexity of the cello suites.  His  technique is flawless.  He brings passion to each note.  As well he  understands when to emphize and when to hold bach on the musical phrasing  of the piece.  <br />I would say that this is a much more complex and exciting  version of Bach than Yo-Yo Ma's recording.  Starker uses vibarto when  needed and called for while Ma falls back on it and over uses this  technique detracting from the music.<br />This is one of my top five classical  recordings that I own the other include Stavinsky's Firebirds Recorded by  the Chicago Symphony, Maria Callus singing Bizets Carmen, Bachs Paratia's  and Viloin Suites recored by Perlman and Mozarts Great Mass in C.
630460288X|4.0|Wesley Snipes was hella funny in this one and he is my favorite character in the movie too. Real funny to watch.
0375707972|3.0|This book is more about relationship and the perculiarities of the human mind than it is about the Holocaust or Jews. Schlink's observations about behavior and your emotions when passion is involved are often deadly  accurate. The plot is rather unique, and his descriptions and observations  of the events leave no doubt that at least portions of this story really  occurred. The author's prose is clear and concise, no wasted words or  excessive imagery, which on occasion wouldn't have been a bad thing. Hanna  is a peculiar character, sometimes sad, at other times frustrating and  impossible to figure out. Having been on the same end of a May-December  romance, I can relate to much of Schlink's confusions and desires as he  speaks of Hanna. He raises some questions and issues to which he gives no  answer, but all things considered, a fine novel. One thing I very much  liked is that the events and outcomes were generally logical and the  turning of events believable.
6305627347|5.0|This is the hardest I've laughed at a movie I saw in the theater in  literally years. I expected it to be pretty good, but it was even better.  Though I don't get Comedy Central, I've seen about half the episodes on  video and read the scripts for them all, and have always laughed my butt  off at the incredible bad taste and Cartman's voice. (it's the WAY he says  stuff). And yes, I am a grown woman. It's too bad the idiots at the MPAA  wouldn't let them go with the original title, &quot;All Hell Breaks  Loose&quot; as it would have been more appropriate to the plot and tone. As  I'm sure you've read, Parker and Stone told the MPAA, pretty much as a joke  because they never expected them to go for it, to change the title to the  present one, and the MPAA didn't get the joke and said it was OK. The songs  were great, and didn't slow the movie down as I thought they would. I  especially liked, &quot;It's Easy Mmmmkay&quot; and &quot;Uncle F*cka&quot;  but my all time favorite number was &quot;Kyle's Mom is a B*tch&quot; as  performed by Cartman, this time with a couple of extra languages thrown in.  I laughed so hard and loud at this that I had to put my hand over my mouth,  because I was actually worried that someone would complain to the usher.  And Cartman's one-word reaction (which I can't print here, partially  because of the profanity and partly because it will be funnier if you don't  know it's coming)at the end of the song when he turns around and sees that  Kyle's Mom is actually standing behind him and has heard the last verse is  one of the single funniest moments in cinema history for me. So besides the  movie being hilarious, it's actually well thought-out (I thought) and had  care put into it. Man, would I love to see the parts they cut out,  considering the stuff they got away with! My only complaint was that it was  too short, and that the insane school bus driver was not in it-I missed  her. I also was grateful my least favorite South Park character, Mr.  Hankey, did not make an appearance. I can't say enough good things about  this movie, or describe how funny it is--you have to see it to believe it.  Unless you're Mr or Ms P.C. in which case stay away--though who knows, even  people who need to lighten up might find themselves hating themselves for  laughing at this movie. I give it 10 out of 10 stars.Mr.  Hankey, did not make an appearance. I can't say enough good things about  this movie, or describe how funny it is--you have to see it to believe it.

B00004T9UF|4.0|I think that Eminem had the hype and the balls to reach stardmom, and does have the balls to make a well rounded CD.  His views change dramatically from song to song making it easier to get into the music because whatever  mood you are in you can turn on this CD and be assured you will be greated  by whatever you would like to hear.  I must admit that I liked Eminem's  lighter hip-hop sound at first, but his &quot;hard-core&quot;(I grimace to  say this about Marshal Mathers)are much better.  But the CD is cramme full  of the original and much treasured hip-hop sounds such as The Real Slim  Shady.  I think that although the CD is a good buy that the collection of  songs needed to be seperated better and organized.  I think that if people  give Eminem enough time, and I for one am hoping they will, he will produce  an awesome and overall hardcore CD.  This one only proved my suspicions  that he had that real rapper some where inside of him.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Awesome album. If you like metal, you must own this CD. All songs are a fantastic. The highlights are Dream of Mirrors, The Nomad and Out of the Silent Planet. The band's performance is simply mind blowing. 3 guitars,  fantastic. Harris, the bass master, Nicko his best performance ever, Bruce,  incredible. What are you waiting ? This is the top of metal.
0553280325|5.0|This magnificent story of a dark carnival that visits a small town is a masterpiece. Ray Bradbury weaves an incredible blend of grace in prose with this tale of a would-be boyhood dream turned nightmare.  The head of the  circus 'Mr. Dark' will really give you chills as he is a pure through and  through villian seeking the souls of everyone in town. 'Something Wicked  This Way Comes' is one of Bradbury's paramount works of pure genius.   Anyone will truly be a Bradbury fan after reading this one.
B00000IQW0|5.0|This movie, and the series that followed it, must have been spectacular failures, in the best sense, because now, twenty years later, you can still see clips from it in those commercials starring Howie Long and Terri  Hatcher.  In other words, the special effects were great fifteen to twenty  years before computer effects were invented.  Admittedly, this was its best  feature, the effects, but the story is well told too, and deserves to be  seen.  The reason, by the way, that the series was cancelled was not  because of low ratings, but because of the high budget.  Galactica deserved  a five-year run, but fans will have to be happy with this movie until the  powers that be finally get going and film some new material involving  Galactica, which they've been talking about doing for years and years.
B00004THAY|4.0|BB has released three fine albums in the past year and at last he records a full-length cd with Clapton.At first, I approached this one with hesitation, especially since the billing means that the cd is being filed  in most record stores under &quot;C&quot; instead of &quot;K.&quot;  Also,  aside from a few  spirited sides and concert appearances, Clapton has  really been going through the motions the past decade or more.Well, the  album is very good, only dragged down from being perfect by occasionally  over-slick production and one lamentable vocal schtck by Clapton on the  Latimore-like &quot;Marry You.&quot;  The title cut is a fiery Hiatt cover;  the production is a bit overwrought, but BB and EC have so much fun with  the song that it holds up.  What follows are some great duets, especially  &quot;Three O'Clock Blues&quot; and the surprisingly acoustic, intimate  &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; and &quot;Worred Life Blues.&quot;  Slow but  funky and ferocious, the two rip into Sam and Dave's &quot;Hold on I'm  Coming&quot; and close out this bluesy soul anthem with a brilliant guitar  conversation (man does it make the hairs on your arm stand up!).  It should  have closed the album.  Instead, the producers use the old standard  &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine.&quot;  It''s a decent cut, but it will not  have you tossing the definitive versions by Sinatra or Charles.While not in  the same league as BB's 1993 colloborative  classic, BLUES SUMMIT, RIDING  WITH THE KING is still worth a few spins around the block.   It will  certainly be interesting to see if the AOR stations-- the Apartheid  Oriented Radio stations as Vernon Reid aptly put it-- will feature this  interracial collaboration and really show mainstream America the genius of  BB King.
B000001ABD|5.0|Stevie is definitely one of, if not the best, musician to ever walk the face of this Earth or any other planet for that matter.  Somehow someone managed to take what they believed were his best songs and compact them  into 2-CDs. Whoever did it must have known that it was a miracle to pick  only 31 of his songs and call them his best. Overall they did a very good  job. Evryone will have a different opinion of what should be on it but the  fact remains that most of the songs we all love is on this. In my opinion  &quot;You and I&quot; and &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; should be included  but this is fine. Its difficult to write a review simply because thinking  about the pure genius of Stevie leaves me speechless. &quot;Ribbon in the  Sky&quot; &quot;Lately&quot; &quot;All I Do&quot; and &quot;Overjoyed&quot;  was enough for me and that was only in addition to all the other timeless  classics listed on this album. This collection is simply a blessing from  God for those who cant afford the &quot;At The End of a Century&quot; Box  set. But no matter how heavenly this cd is, there is still one problem :  &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;. Never should have been placed next to (let  alone in between) &quot;Send One Your Love&quot; and &quot;All I Do&quot;.  This is a collection for anyone who has any musical bone in their body.   This is the type of collection that a deaf person would give 5 stars or  more.
B000002J20|4.0|Tales certainly isn't the best Yes album the group ever released, but i would definately say that it is probably Yes at their most Yes-like. Track 1, the Revealing Science of God is a great song, and certainly ranks up  with the best Yes epics. The Remembering is perhaps the one track i never  really got into. The middle section of the song is great, and so is the  ending, but this is one song Yes should have probably trimmed down a  little. The Ancient seems to be the track most people dislike, though i  quite like it. Howe's acoustic work is superb, and so is the whole 'leaves  of green' section. Ritual is probably the second best song overall, and  Howe's guitar solo at the end of this song is arguably the greatest guitar  moment ever, in my opinion atleast, and is the perfect end to this  album.<br />Although certainly not for everyone, if you listened to and liked  Close To The Edge and Relayer, you will no doubt like this record.
B000005RTG|5.0|This is not your Blackmore's Purple.  Tommy Bolin brings a real spark of life to the beast, and it shows, here's a band having FUN!  This is by far the most adventurous, most creative, and in my humble opinion, best album Purple  ever did.  Now don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Purple and Blackmore but  the band never sounded like they enjoyed themselves so much.  You can hear  it,  listen closely, this band lineup is tight.  All of this is very  noticable if you listen to Ian's drumming, he's flat out swinging!  Glenn's  vocals and bass is right on the mark.  Tommy is nothing short of incredible  and no, he doesn't even try to do Richie, he's his own man.  Thank God!   Lord and Coverdale are just like you would expect them, great! If your a  biased Purple fan then you might not like this album but if you love great  MUSIC, then this one's for you!
0788811363|5.0|The awe-inspiring beauty and quality acting of this film leaves audiences  inebriated with it.  Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scottt Thomas, Juliette  Binoche, and Willem Dafoe perfectly portray their roles.  Fiennes brings  the role of Count Almasy to life by capturing his flaws, the tragedy, and  unwavering devotion to his lover immacualtely.  Scott Thomas, contrary to  some opinions, is exraordinary in her role as the very complicated and very  confused Katherine Clifton.  Both Binoche and Dafoe offer great  performances and, ina Binoche's case, a break from the intense situations  in the flashbacks with Fiennes and Scott Thomas.  The English Patient is by  far one of the best movies of the century.  Don't miss out on this  incredible classic!
B000000WA4|5.0|I would definitely agree with the person that said this is one of the greatest two disc albums ever. The creativity and emotions are so fluent and lush. Like Siamese Dream, Corgan supplies us with some of the best rock songs ever written with &quot;tonight tonight&quot;, &quot;Bullet With  Butterfly Wings&quot;, and &quot;1979&quot;. Which definitely got their  deserved air time. You might have gotten a little sick of them, but they  ARE truly magnificent. Of course those aren't the only good songs on the  cd. Every song is incredible, well, except for one or two. I don't want to  write the same exact thing as everyone else on reviewing this, so I'm going  to just end my review with a blunt and straight forward statement. If you  don't have this album.....then your cd collection is worth nothing.
0887431461|5.0|my son loved this workbook! it is a great teaching tool, where the child has fun while being intoduced to the basics he/she will learn in Kindergarten. Easy to follow directions and fun pictures make it a favorite   &quot;activity/coloring book&quot; for any child entering kindergarten  whether he has a desire to learn or not.  I highly recommend this book to  all parents.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Throughout the history of Rock music, there are certain musicians that bless the world with a certain masterpiece that is so flawless and pleasing that one can only shower it with praise. This is one of those albums. In my  opinion it compares to such classics as &quot;The Dark Side of the  Moon&quot;, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV (or whatever one you think is their  best)&quot;, and even &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. This album just keeps the  hits coming. &quot;Disarm&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Cherub  Rock&quot;, and &quot;Mayonaise&quot; are some of the best rock songs  written. This is an essential for any rock fan, even if the Pumpkins aren't  high on your list. A MUST HAVE.
B000002KDS|5.0|&quot;Killer&quot; is the finest hard rock album of the early 1970's.  The AC Group was a garage band with imagination (albeit twisted).  The fact that none of them was the best in the business at what they do (no Jimmy  Pages or John Bonhams here) is no matter.  For me, the coolest song on the  album is &quot;Desperado&quot;, which Alice penned with Mike Bruce as a  tribute to his drinking buddy Jim Morrison.  With Doors-like lyrics and a  dead-on Morrison impersonation in the intro, Alice draws in the listener  like a predator luring his prey.  Then, with the line &quot;I'm a killer  and I'm a clown&quot; you literally visualze Morrison's face transforming  into the demented clown face of Alice--an absolutely brilliant performance  of a cleverly written lyric.  That's the beauty of all Alice Cooper albums,  but especially the Bob Ezrin-produced work of the original AC Group--you  don't just get a bunch of songs--you get a rich visual tapestry of the dark  side of humanity, &amp; &quot;Killer&quot; is the best of those albums.   &quot;Killer&quot; is a must for any comprehensive hard rock collection.
B0000028UK|5.0|This album, in my opinion towers above the likes of Ten or Vitalogy...but it is hard to compare pearl jam albums. They are all great. Yield, Binaural, and Vs. are probably my fav's. I said that Binaural was my fav.  Pj album in a review, but that's just because it's new to me. All Pearl Jam  albums are beautiful in different ways. This one has some beautiful  acoustic ballads in &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;elderly woman....&quot;,  and then supplies the listener with some groovy tunes in that of  &quot;dissident&quot; and &quot;rearviewmirror&quot;. I'm not sure if  groovy is the best way to describe those songs...I guess kickass would be a  better way. This is probably the most listener friendly album other than  &quot;ten&quot;. If you want to become acquainted with PJ, I would start  here. Other fans would say ten...but I think this gives the best impression  of the diverse and artistic rock band that Pearl Jam is.
B000002I99|5.0|I imagine a 10 year old kid walking home late at night, deciding to take a shortcut through the woods and getting lost.  He walks into a clearing just as the full moon comes out from behind the clouds and he realizes he's in a  graveyard...and he's not alone... This is a very cool album, and there  really is nothing else like it out there.  If it has a weakness, it is the  somewhat misplaced and puzzling anthem &quot;Department of Youth&quot;--the  song just doesn't seem to fit.  But when did Alice ever worry about  conventional wisdom?
B00000J7JO|4.0|Okay....Everyone is going to say this is a great album. I'd say its a great album, but not incredible. Most of the songs here are great (&quot;scar tissue&quot;, &quot;californication&quot;, &quot;road  trippin&quot;) You know. The only problem is that it lacks their signature  funk style. Damn....I miss it. The only song that satisfies that need is  &quot;I like dirt&quot;. The other attempted funk songs aren't very good  (&quot;get on top&quot; &quot;emmit remmus&quot;)..ICK Oh well, what can  you do. I guess they've changed their style. I like the new direction, but  i'm still holding on to &quot;Give it Away, and &quot;suck my kiss&quot;.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam got way better with each new album, until Yield.  They lost something there, trying to get back into the fold (money money).  I was worried about this album, after yield, and when I heard Nothing as it seems on the radio, I thought, 'what are they doing?'  It sounded  like a boring Radiohead effort, and I was unimpressed.  I bought the album  anyway, and it's their best one yet.  They've gone into this whole new area  of 'screw pop' music.  Songs like Evacuation (written by Matt Cameron,  which made me freak out when I learned he was in the band, what a fantastic  band Soundgarden was) and 'Of the girl' just blow me away, fantastic.  The  only songs I don't like are God's Dice, Nothing as it seems, both written  by Ament, which is a shame, because his songs are usually great, and  whatever number 4 is.  The rest are great.  Fantastic album.
B0000027RL|4.0|This is a great record that has some incredible rock songs. However, all of the songs sound very similar. There is a lack of diversity in that every song has the same formula with the anthemic melodies, towering vocals, and  similar guitar and bass lines that cause the songs to have the same general  feeling. Even the softer songs follow the same formula as the harder ones.  This problem does not occur in PJ's later albums. Vs, Vitalogy, Yeild,  Binaural, and even No Code show much more diversity than this. Although  this provided us with some of their best songs, it's all the same stuff  over and over again.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club, some call a masterpiece some an exploitation movie that's only  purpose is to show men beating the crap out of each other. Either one could  be true but this is a movie that depend on the viewers likes and dislikes.  Anyone who is happy in their life and does not think that anything is wrong  with the world should not take this film too seriously. On the other hand,  people who hate their job, and the society that they live in could find  this the most truthfull film they hae ever seen. My opinion is that it is a  masterpiece from director David Fincher, who's last two films also packed  quite a whallop (Seven &amp; The Game). Fincher seems to know exactly what  he wants in his movies and knows how to put what he wants on the screen.  <br />Pitt and Norton are alson excellent, especially Norton who has shown  great diversity in his previous roles, (American History X, Primal Fear  &amp; Keeping The Faith). If anyone can play a manic depressant it is  Norton. He even outdoes Nicholas Cage's performance in &quot;Bringing Out  The Dead&quot;.<br />This film is one of my favorite films of the year, the  opening credits alone are a standout. And when the film is over you just  feel like standing up and yelling :I WANT MORE!<br />But it is also a film  that you have have to make your own mind up about. If you haven't seen it  SEE IT, if you have seen it SEE IT AGAIN.<br />Oh and just for those movie  buffs out there, try pausing in a few places at the start and try to catch  Pitt in the scene in a one frame cameos. (The testicular cancer meeting is  one place you will see him.)
B00003CWPR|1.0|I should have followed the advice of the title of this movie and kept MY EYES SHUT for this movie.  This movie made &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; look like a classic.<br />If you are a wanna be upper east side, art loving, $8  coffee drinking, 35 year old, pierced nose person and want to discuss  Stanley Kubrick's incredible direction and flow of the movie, buy this  movie.<br />But if you want to be entertained, run from this movie.  It's not  thought provoking, I think this is Kubrick's practical joke to the world.
6303257844|5.0|I think this is the best action movie ever made. It never lets up, the effects are terrific, and the cast superb. Keanu Reeves ! no other actor could have done a better Jack Traven...he's absolutely wonderful in this  and at least an 11 on the hunk-o-meter. If you don't insist on total  reality, and want to enjoy the ride, this is the one to take..let Jack save  your day too and bring excitement, humor, and his great smile into your  living room with this marvelous movie !
6305426651|5.0|Each time I watch this movie, I am amazed at the captivating plot, talented acting, twists and humor, and wonderful story. All my friends who have seen this film fall in love with it immediately (they are at first  wary of a movie entirely in Italian, but it doesn't really matter after you  are sucked into the story). There are clearly two parts, the first half  about the irresistable Jewish waitor Guido winning the love of a  schoolteacher, and the second half about his desparate attempts to protect  his new family from the horrors that soon surround them in WWII. All the  while his wit and quick-thinking will have you laughing and feeling good.  It truly convinces you that, indeed, life is beautiful. I have a quick  story that pertains to this film. We were watching this movie with our  friends while on vacation. Our friend's young son was watching it  off-and-on, but joined us at the ending. After the last freezing frame,  there was a moment of silence, and then the eight-year-old piped, &quot;I  thought they meant a fish tank.&quot; Those who have seen the movie will  understand the joke. If you haven't yet, rent it, buy it, and watch it! La  Vita e Bela!
0060976624|3.0|A pretty funny book and a nice light read but that's it (for better Buckley humor see 'God is my Broker'). It's hip to like Buckley these days. Similar to Dave Barry reviews, the exaggerated praises wear a bit thin over  time ( e.g. 'I laughed out loud for weeks', etc).  His 'look at me, I'm  inside the beltway' act is also getting tired. All this being said, I still  recommend this book - just not the accompanying hype.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Help! I want to buy but I need to know what I'm buying . . .
0783117388|5.0|When I first heard about Sex in the City, I thought it was another of the &quot;Chick Shows&quot; that men should run from.  I was expecting the demographics were going to be the 35 year old, twice divorced, man hating  women of the world. But after the first episode, I haven't missed the show  once since (I do have a life, and a VCR).  <br />My wife enjoys the show  because of the women be empowered and educated.  I like the show because  they say things that men always want to know.  Plus the four ladies aren't  hard on the eyes.  If you watch this show and don't laugh out loud at some  point, go to PBS and watch the Antique Roadshow.
B000001EC1|4.0|You can tell by the songlist how great this CD is.  However, the International version is much better.  <br />It includes the same tracks, except it doesn't have Prayer 94 (not a good song anyway).  Instead though  it has &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;In These Arms&quot;, two of  their BEST tunes which are not on the US version.   The addition of those  two songs makes for a much stronger collection - and it's worth the extra  price.
B00004T0P1|5.0|On a flight across the country, the airline provided a Disney Station to listen to which featured the Dinosaur Soundtrack. I was extremely impressed; I was even compelled to see the movie, and now I am buying the  CD. I still have the intracate melodies in my head, and its been weeks.  With each song, carries a different mood, but all are alike in quality.  Each song matches up to the previous and the next, because theey are all  amazing. Even friends of mine who are not interested in instrumental music  such as this were impressed. It deserves 6 stars, at the least!
0767903854|3.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Bryson's other books, and found myself laughing every few pages in this one, but maybe I'm getting accustomed to his style, as I didn't find this as satisfying, page for page, as his other efforts. I  think perhaps his lack of familiarity with the country left him reporting  his findings more than commenting on them, and it's his commentary that is  so engaging. the book had more history and descriptions, and I wanted the  wise cracks!
0812550706|4.0|If you teach general literature for kids anywhere from junior high to college, this is a great bet. I used it in my intro. to lit. with college sophmores in order to introduce ideas about how mythologies govern moral  systems, idealism v. utilitarianism, inverted religious typologies, some  traditional philosphy as well as the usual fiction elements (setting, plot,  blah blah blah), and everyone loved it.  This is a rare feat for a lit.  class.  Students who said they deplore sci. fi. said they loved it;  students who said they deplor *reading* said they loved it.  And Ender's  Game functions nicely as a springboard into &quot;heavier&quot; texts.   It's also amenable to introduction to literary theories such as  postmodernism, freudianism, and the old standby of structuralism.  Best of  all, it's great fun--your students will actually contribute to class  discussion!
0684800713|5.0|Few books leave such lasting footprints on my memory.  The Sun Also Rises is indeed one of those books.  To some, it may seem that little really happens in the book; but it does.  At the heart of the story, as someone  already mentioned, Jake Barnes is impotent (castrated), yet he yearns to  hook up with Brett Ashley.  Of course, she knows his predicament and her  ultimate decisions (and his) are based on that knowledge.  <br />Hemingway's  most talked-about quality was his ability to characterize through dialogue.   But some &quot;book doctors&quot; say that he uses too much of it and that  his sense of balance between dialogue and narration is off-kilter.   Sometimes I agree, but I'm usually so wrapped up in Hemingway's magic that  I don't really notice.  <br />My favorite part of the book is the fishing trip  that Barnes and Bill Gorton take prior to attending the festival in Spain.   It made me want to dig out my rod and reel and take a vacation myself.  The  scene reminds me of Hemingway's story &quot;The Big Two-Hearted  River,&quot; except that Barnes is not alone; he has Bill with him.  I also  enjoyed the scene in the bar when the Spaniards absorb the Americans into  their group and share their wine with them. Indeed, alcohol plays an  important role in The Sun Also Rises; a whole cast of down-and-out  characters emerge who drift and drink through life as though nothing else  matters.<br />Hemingway is indeed my favorite writer and this book stands at  the head of my list of all-time beloved novels.
044022165X|5.0|This is the first Grisham book I've had the pleasure of reading, now I'm wondering what I missed in the others.  I've seen all the movies based on his book and they were all great.  Rudy Baylor is a character anyone can  related to. I recommend this book.
B000002BHE|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing&quot;Because you loved me,&quot;by Diane Warren.A wonderfull song from the movie,&quot;Up Close and Personal.&quot; (If you ever look at the Billboard charts,just check out how many songs are  written by Diane,what a talent) When I First played the CD,and &quot;Its  all coming back to be now,&quot; came on, I was hooked.What a fantastic  song by Meat Loafs producer Jim Steinman.I just hate to hear this song on  the radio,they cut it terrible.(In my mind,I think this would have been a  great opening number for Barbra Streisand to sing when she made her   concert comeback in the early 90's.About leaving her fans,but returning  where she left off,and its all coming back to her now.) If anyone thinks  Celine can just sing Ballads,wait untill you hear &quot;River Deep,Mountain  High.&quot; This was Tina Turner's big hit,but Celine brings down the house  with her version,and mentions Tina in the song. When you get to  the last  song, and &quot;Fly&quot; comes on,  you will have tears in your eyes.My  Mom died shortly before this record came out,and I think about her  going  to The Light. I have four Celine Dion records,but this one's the best.
B000000W6X|5.0|But there are 8 other amazing songs on this album. Though a lot of people at the time were disappointed with this follow up to Blue Lines, I felt it was even better than the debut.<br />Fans of Tricky will recognize  &quot;Karmacoma,&quot; as the lyrics and basic music is shared by his own  &quot;Overcome.&quot;<br />Everything But the Girl's Tracey Thron's vocals fit  in perfectly with the music, making this a perfect chill-out disc.<br />The  only song that doesn't fit here is the cover of The Doors' &quot;Light My  Fire&quot;. It's the last song, and easily programmed out of the cd, so  that isn't too big of an issue, but why the band felt the need to include  it in the first place is anybody's guess.
B000002J09|1.0|I bought this album four months ago after repeatedly reading how utterly fantastic it was,how it was probably the greatest album ever. Today I use it as a coaster for cups of coffee.
B00004U8P3|5.0|Jurassic PArk is a great movie and this Collectors Edition does not let it down. It is about a wealthy man who clones dinosaurs, and takes some scientist to pretest the facility then everything goes wrong because of  another persons greed. This movie has everything a bit of romance, some  scary bits and all adventure.I would recommend it to anyone.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Maybe I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to 90's British pop, thanks to a feeling I get that the rock press on both sides of the Atlantic can't wait to cram some flash in the pan down America's throat. On the other hand, I  love Q magazine and when I read that its readers had chosen &quot;OK  Computer&quot; as the greatest album of all time, I thought, &quot;What a  bunch of idiots,&quot; and then, &quot;Damn, maybe it's good.&quot;<br />Well,  it is *good*, but only good. &quot;Airbag&quot; and &quot;Subterranean  Homesick Alien&quot; I would hold up to some of the decade's best music.  Fantastic, but not enough to warrant &quot;instant classic&quot;. Take  &quot;Fitter, Happier&quot;, for example. Yorke, et. al. take the  terminally hokey device of using a computer-generated monotone voice to  tell the listener how he (it?) isn't &quot;drinking too much&quot; and some  claptrap about &quot;not crying in public&quot;. OOOOH, I get it...  detached computer voice talking about the distinctly human characteristics  of some sad rock singer! Oh, the irony!<br />Spare me.
079073804X|4.0|I have no doubt that this is the scariest movie ever made. No stone was left unturned when William Freidken and team wanted to make this a film  that would burn itself into you memory. This is a movie that will effect  you emotionally in a number a horrifying ways. The DVD looks and sounds  great. Proof that the sound of a film can and will have just as much impact  on you as the visuals will. The bonus material is first rate. Get this DVD.  Turn down the lights, put the kids to bed, turn up the home theatre and get  ready to be terrified beyond belief !
B00001OH7P|1.0|Look I'll be brutally honest with you. I used to be a Bowie fan a few years ago, but now he's become my pet hate. It's not just because he's the biggest weed of all time, but also because that very weediness is reflected  in his limp music.Besides that he can't utter more than two words without  making an absolute idiot of himself. Remember when he did the Lord's Prayer  at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert? Isn't that the most embarrassing  thing you've ever seen?I don't know if David Bowie or Pink Floyd should get  the award for The Most Prentious Tripe Of All Time.
B00003CXGG|4.0|This was a good movie, however it does not show Jet Li's fuill capabilities. Jet Li's stlye is given a twist which is a great new turn and he is even funny in this movie. Many actors act as comic relief which is a  new turn in the Jet Li legacy. One thing this movie has that most of his  movies do not have is a true, down to earth, plot. I recommend seeing this  movie once. If you like it as much as I did you should buy it. Note:  Vermont is a terrible substitute for Oakland.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem has done it again.  This album is off the wall!  Its lyrics and ideas are great.  It deals with some issues in a way teens will hear them.  People who are upset about him &quot;picking&quot; on them need to get over  it.  Eminem's entire LP is right on target.  He is a great rapper.  Not a  great white rapper, simply a great rapper.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I reviewed this album right when it came out and I want to review it again--that's how much I like it.  Each song is really wonderful.  The album is much better than &quot;BOMT&quot; as a whole; the songs work  really well together and sort of blend.  I really like how her songs have  more edge and sass to them.  You can tell that Britney is having more and  more say in her music and it's sounding better and better.  Obviously,  &quot;Oops&quot; is an excellent song.  Other great ones are  &quot;Stronger,&quot; &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; &quot;Lucky,&quot; and  &quot;When Your Eyes Say It.&quot;  This is the best album out there right  now, so get it while it's hot.
630587493X|5.0|I was very reluctant to see this movie.  I was wrong.  From the movie's plot alone, one may think this movie is very plain and uninteresting.  If you really see it and think of every single element of words and  characteristics, displayed by extradinary cast members, you will agree that  this movie should be collectible.  Not because of its creativity or special  effects, but it has everything that can associate with us, human beings.   Love.  Understanding.  Relation.  Compassion.  And most of all, PRIDE.   Pride in being a man.  No matter what you look like, your heart will show  the truth.  One may look like a man, but his heart is a beast.  Should that  person be considered as a man?  One may look like a beast, but he has a  heart of gold.  That is a real man.  This movie is about a robot who is  trying to achieve his goal, to be accepted into the society as a human and  to be with his love.  And he would do anything for that.  Everyone has his  or her dreams, but how many of them are willing to do anything to reach for  the star.  Bicentennial Man will bring you joy and courage, not to mention  romance.
B000002BYA|3.0|Musically speaking, there seemed to be two distinctly different SRV's. There was the classic blues-rocker, &amp; there was the lightning fast, in-your-face &quot;rockabilly&quot; guitarist. Much of this set (for  instance, &quot;Scuttle Buttin'&quot;, Testifyin'&quot;, &amp; &quot;Rude  Mood&quot;) falls into the latter category. The more straight blues  material in the second half is given a big-band feel due to the five-piece  horn section. Personally, I'm not a big fan of horn sections OR rockabilly.  As a result, I'd much prefer the straight-ahead blues-rock of LIVE ALIVE.  Depends on your personal preference.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD! BLINK182 ARE THE BEST BAND AROUND! This is the best CD they made so far!<br />Dumpweed: Great, yet not the best<br />Don't Leave Me: Funny<br />Aliens Exist: This is one of my favorite songs!<br />Going Away To  College: Phat!<br />What's My Age Again?: Your all famalir with this song.  It  never gets boring! Its another favorite!<br />Dynesty Gary: The best song! It  has cussing in it, but it is funny! <br />Adam's Song: A really serious song.   Its good, and very serious.  Another one of my favorites!<br />All The Small  Things: Has no meaning to it, yet a good song, and another one of my  favorites!<br />Party Song: This is truely a party song! Its a really  wanna-get-up-and-dance song.  Another one of my favorites<br />Mutt: Funny!  Its gross, but its funny.  Another one my favorites.<br />Wendy Clear: Hard to  understand the meaning, but its worth listening to.<br />Anthem: Great beat,  Travis plays great.  Its funny, and another one of my favorites.<br />So, if  you don't have this CD yet, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT! It is the best CD in the  world, and Blink182 is the best punk-band ever!
0792833236|5.0|Raging Bull is one of the best films of all time not because of its boxing scenes but because of the humanity that is presented. It shows a man, confused by sexuality and city life, hanging on by his teeth, who finds  refuge in boxing. Sexuality is a key note of this movie because at all  times, it is Jake's driving force in life. He wants the girl, the  satisfaction of having &quot;conquered&quot; her, and a radiant aspect for  his depressing life. He boxes not only as a release, but to keep food on  the table. He's a combination of Stanley Kowalski (A Streetcar Named  Desire) and Rocky. Sexuality is his language, and he must box to survive.  These themes clash occasionally although he tries his best to separate  them, and that creates the side of DeNiro's character we relate to. He is a  mean, crude, nasty guy on the outside and in, but we see his struggle and  love soaking up his mental anguish. Perhaps we have gone through similar  situations. Or maybe we want desparately to see somebody with real problems  to make ours look petty. I prefer to believe the latter. An outstanding  movie from a gifted director. Scorsese continues to amaze me.
6305313687|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS TRUELY WONDERFUL. FROM IT'S GREAT SCENERY TO THE EXCELLENT DIALOGUE AND A BRILLANT PERFORMANCE BY NORTON, THIS MOVIE IS BOTH POWERFUL AND INSPIRATIONAL. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT A NEO NAZI CAN CHANGE, SEE  THIS MOVIE AND MAYBE IT WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. NORTON AND THE STORY ARE  VERY CONVINCING!
B00000016O|5.0|This Album has the greatest song ever recorded on it. I am not talking about the title track but rather The Last Resort. It gives me goose bumps every time I hear it. I am by no means putting down the title track. It is  every bit as incredible as it is hyped to be. Life in the Fast Lane, Wasted  Time, Pretty Maids All in a Row and New Kid in Town are great songs too.  This one starts strong with Hotel California and ends stronger with The  Last Resort.
6302548195|4.0|This is a great movie of you are a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger or if you  have a love for weight training. Personally, I like both, therefore I loved  this movie a heck of a lot. I also loved learning what happens behind the  scenes at bodybuilding competitions and the relationships between the  competitors on and off stage. Watch it, absorb it, love it.
6304712499|1.0|Why bother?  The extra footage is a ploy!  It seemed stupid to make a directors cut if the movie itself was good to begin with.  I love this movie but I was highly disappointed with this DVD, not enough bang for the  buck I am afraid.  There are better DVD's than this and I know in the  future they will make a decent directors cut that is worth watching.
B00000JPHD|5.0|Bela Lugosi is my hero.  This film is the greatest of all time, and the second greatest is it's predecessor, Nosferatu, and the only reason its so good is because of how monstrous Max Schreck as Graf Orlock is.  But Bela Lugosi redefines Dracula as an attractive and mysterious ladies man, which  probably would have surprised Bram Stoker.  This movie also has memorable  performances by Dwight Frye as the odd little Renfeld, and Edward van Sloan  as Van Helsing, the doctor who (unfortunately) does in Dracula and looks  like Duke Nukem (hee hee). The one thing that bothers me about this is the  fact that Dracula fears crucifuxes and also the fact that that Phillip  Glass added music too it...luckily i bought the musicless version.  You  just can't desecrate a classic like that.  Bela Lugosi must be rolling in  his grave
6305627347|3.0|I waited for months to get &quot;South Park&quot; on video herein Europe, and I ended up more disappointed than satisfied.  Yes, themovie is full of hilarious moments.  But I personally got tired of the swearing after about the first 10 minutes and thought that the point had been made. I am not a prude.  This was baseball-bat-over-the-head satire about America's infatuation with morality.  There is nothing whatsoever sly or suggestive about &quot;South Park&quot;, and I know that's the point, but still.  There are a few great things in the movie, though -- the way it deals with poor Kenny is brilliant, and the deal with Satan and Sadam Hussein is good for a bunch of chuckles, too.  Overall, though, I really was expecting more.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver marked the end of the first Beatles era--that of teen pop icons--and the beginning of the second Beatles era--experimentation, social protest and lasting influence in Rock music.  I am contantly amazed by the  breadth of the songs on this album.  From &quot;Taxman&quot; and  &quot;Eleanor Rigsby&quot; with their scathing criticisms to John Lennon's  first drug induced songs including &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; and  &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.  Ringo has his one and only shot at  singing before Thomas the Tank Engine on PBS with &quot;Yellow  Submarine&quot;  As you listen closely, the album only gets brighter.  The  tight production is amazing.  The use of strings in Eleanor Rigsby and the  sitar in several tunes is quite revolutionary.  This album changed rock  music for the better, and I am glad to recommend it!
B00002E233|3.0|Turning dangerous wild, or fabulous beasts into credible film stars is an art which has evaded movie makers since the media was invented. There have, naturally, been exceptions. King Kong worked by humanising a 40ft. gorilla.  Jaws worked because the scripting, direction and acting were so damn good,  you didn't really care if the shark looked a little rubbery in close-up.  However, few movies have featured artificial creatures which genuinely  looked and acted like the real thing. This is where &quot;Deep Blue  Sea&quot; comes up trumps. The animatronic makos are truly state-of-the-art  and digital animation is used sensibly to create stunning underwater attack  scenes. From this point of view, the film might merit 5 stars. However,  there are other elements which downgrade the movie in comparison with the  benchmark shark (and monster) movie, &quot;JAWS&quot;!  Primarily,  &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is standard disaster movie fare....&quot;The  Poseidon Adventure&quot; with big fish. The characterisation remains fairly  sketchy throughout and is sacrificed for the exhilarating pace of the  action. The casting is far from spectacular. Model-actress, Saffron  Burrows, is more model than actress and nobody manages to convey the  &quot;scientific&quot; content with any conviction. By contrast, the  casting of the main characters in &quot;Jaws&quot; was pure genius. Having  said this, LL Cool J does pleasantly surprise as the comic relief and  Kevin-Costner-a-like, Thomas Jane, is an amiable enough hero. Additionally,  whilst the attack scenes in &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; are superbly done, if  you blink, you may miss them. Whereas &quot;Jaws&quot; used the implication  that sharky shenanigans were on the horizon to create tension and suspense,  there is no build up to the pay-off in the newer movie. In conclusion,  &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is a spectacular action movie and easy to  recommend for sheer entertainment value. But, whilst we await the release  of &quot;Jaws&quot; on DVD, I wonder whether 25 years down the line, the  memory of the sharks that outshone their human co-stars will be all that  remains of this film?
B00004TJFL|5.0|Halloween 5 is the conclusion of Halloween 4.In Halloween 5 Michael Myers is still after his niece.And in this movie Michael can be seen without his mask.In the beginning it shows the niece(Jamie)and here foster sister  Rachel in a car and Michael is on top of the car and when she stops and  want flying and she hits him with the car and he falls.When the state  troops came they shoot him in a mine and he cralls out and for a year he  stays with a hermit and on Halloween a year later he wakes up and thats  when the terror starts.This restored video has interviews and more.Also  Anchor Bay entertainment will release Halloween 1-The Televion version.Also  if your a Halloween fan there is suppose to be a Halloween H2K which is the  next installment.
B00004T9UF|3.0|The new eminem cd is ok. I felt the beats were very well done yet the lyrics are really messed up. The lyrics talk about him killing things and stuff of that criteria. Now i never bought his first album &quot;Slim  Shady&quot; My overall feeling is the marshall mathers lp should be called  &quot;ThE mesSED-uP LP&quot; ...hers LP.  From the opening Public Service 2000 track, where  Eminem and his narrator repeadetly find ways of telling the listener that  he doesn't give a *uck what they think of the forthcoming material.   Perhaps this serves as forewarning to the over-the-top cuts on this album.      Opening things off is 'Kill You', where Eminem reaffirms the troubles in  his life and how sooner or later, he just might end up dead but don't mess  with him, man, cause he'll take you down.  Typical fare, done with a little  more bite.  Make that a lot more bite.  Numerous tracks on the album follow  suit, such as Marshall Mathers and Remember Me?  Also thrown in are some  ... interesting... story-songs like Stan (a highlight), a tale of a  demented, obsessed fan, and the downright chilling 'Kim', where Eminem  screams throughout the entire song at his girlfriend, finally ending in a  bloodbath that ultimatley proves to be a mere prologue to '97 Bonnie and  Clyde' from the Slim Shady LP.<br />  The Dr. Dre produced tracks are among  the best, as expected.  And the single 'The Real Slim Shady' is the most  up-beat, accessible cut on the album, as well as being completley hilarious  in content.  But the rest of Marshall Mathers is dark, twisted, and  sometimes downright frightening.  Through it all, his innate rapping skill  remains, despite his content, he truly is one of the most skilled rappers  today.<br />  At the end of the album, once again, Em turns up to remind the  listener that this was all just a joke.  However, with the overall content  of the CD being so dark, venemous, and hateful, sometimes it's very hard to  believe that Eminem really isn't just an extremely tortured Axl Rose for  the new millenium.
0871359448|5.0|This set of stories is definitely among the best works of fiction ever to reach the printed page!  The most important characters such as Captain America, Silver Surfer, and Thanos are handled flawlessly.  The entire  first five sections just keep building the suspense and you are wondering  the entire time &quot;how are the good guys going to win?&quot; and we find  out in the sixth. This book shows why Marvel comics are the best because we  care about the characters.  The book also has Captain America's defining  moment: at the end of the battle only Cap stands.  He walks up to the  God-like Thanos.  His shield is destroyed and Thanos brings his fist  towards him.  Captain America stands there, defiance to the last.  The look  in his eye, captured perfectly by Ron Lim says it all. In short, if you are  a fan of comics, or even if you aren't and want to see why so many of us  feel like the characters are friends and, in some cases like Captain  America, even good role models, then buy this book!
031218087X|1.0|I can't figure out why this book is so highly rated so far.  It is so trite...especially the love story, very Hollywood.  This was written to be made into a bad movie.  The best thing I can say about it is that it's  fast-moving, and increasingly picks up speed.  But it's derivative and  empty of characterization and even information.
6305499365|5.0|I thought this movie was really funny! Sometimes simple stories are best! I could really relate to their situations.
6303450083|1.0|Other Than Despite, The Very Good Special Effects and Christina Ricci's  Performance, this low-brow, unentertainment smash of hot dogs, is so dull,  and boring, you can't even think what happens next, Bull Pullman, Cathy  Moriarty, Eric Idle utterly wasted in this film, and the plot is  uninteresting, borrowing from Ghost. Miserable.
1558908420|3.0|With a cast and a plot &quot; &agrave; la Scorsese &quot; , James Mangold's COP  LAND unfortunately isn't even an half &quot; &agrave; la Scorsese &quot; movie.  Like Freddy &quot;Sylvester Stallone&quot; Heflin, COP LAND is slow, heavy  and so evident. Just imagine that the director, in order to make us  understand that the Sheriff Heflin is not fighting for the world record of  smartness per square/kilo, films during long minutes a turtle, the little  toy of his girlfriend's daughter.<br />But I did have a huge pleasure to  admire Sylvester Stallone in this role which seems to have been written  specially for him. Besides, Ray Liotta, Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro are  great as usual. So COP LAND is an average movie that provides the kind of  pleasure one can expect from an average movie (I agree, it's not the  smartest thought of the year !).<br />If you want to see a great movie about  corrupt cops, rent or buy Sidney Lumet's THE PRINCE OF THE CITY (alas, not  in the DVD standard), you won't be disappointed.<br />A DVD for Sly.
0440219078|5.0|I am a 8th grader at a small school and did not read at all orat least for my own interest until last summer. Last summer I pickedthe giver from my book list and decided to read it. When I first started reading the book it was confusing but I continued to read. It took me three days to finish the book. When finished I was speechless, I wanted to read it again. It was a kind of book I had never read before. Since reading the giver I have read about ten books ( which is very good for me)with excitement and enthusiasm and plan to do read more. The Giver opened many doors for me, one I have explained already, my new love for reading. The other, gave me a sense of what I want to do when I am older, I want to be a writer. I give this book five stars and even more if I could.

B000002LND|5.0|Years before Madonna's evolution from oversexed artist behind &quot;Erotica&quot; to vocally-trained diva in &quot;Evita&quot; to enlightened mother on &quot;Ray of Light,&quot; Madonna was simply a pop  singer.  Lightweight songs like &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Lucky  Star&quot; inspired countless debates on the girl's longevity, and her  airy, helium-like delivery on &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material  Girl&quot; added fuel to her detractor's fire.  &quot;Papa Don't  Preach&quot; was better, and by the time she offered up the likes of  &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Express Yourself,&quot; it was clear  that La Ciccone was definitely capable of musical maturity and growth.  One  thing that has stayed consistent, however (and is still true to this day),  is the fact that all of her incarnations are the most infectious musical  parties you'll ever encounter.<br />&quot;Open Your Heart&quot; and the  Supremes-like &quot;Cherish&quot; are still two of the catchiest, slickest  pop singles of our time, while &quot;Live to Tell&quot; rings with a mature  resonance.  &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; may not be a fresh idea (pop stars  have always delved into Latin/Spanish territory, long before anyone was  living la vida loca) but it still has a killer hook.  &quot;Vogue&quot;  preceeded the club music movement of the early 90's and still sounds every  bit the pioneer. <br />The only complaint with the compilation is the fact  that early tracks get fast, early fades, stopping before the song is truly  over...&quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Express Yourself&quot; even get  trimmed a bridge each.  This is done to make room for an extended version  of &quot;Like a Prayer,&quot; a dancey, remixed affair that's all well and  good, but the original's striking blend of gospel verse and rock chorus is  missed.   There's also two new songs to fit in, and while the steamy,  spoken-word excursion &quot;Justify My Love&quot; is one of her better  moments, her overly-throatydelivery on the mediocre club track  &quot;Rescue Me&quot; sounds like a bad Cher imitation.  <br />But overall  this a tight collection of impeccably produced pop music that justifies our  obsession with Madonna.  Is this bubblegum pop?  Absolutely.  But it's the  sweetest damn bubblegum you'll ever taste.

0783225733|5.0|I was there and it still puts needles on the back of my neck. This was one of America's finest hours and a great national success - because thousands of people pulled together to save three lives. If there was ever a  &quot;Private Ryan&quot; of space this is it. The many caring for the few.  But isn't that what the space program is all about. The film is a  remarkable production and gives only a little artistic license for effect.  All in all a thorough recommendation with solid presentation of a high  technical standard. Five stars and then some. It was some time before I  could bring myself to watch the movie because I didn't want the crystal  clarity of these tense-filled days to be coloured by a director's version  but I had to watch it eventually and it did nothing to take away the  reality of what we all felt. This is where the DVD improves the experience.  The clarity and the content are production editing at its very best. Great  movie and a great DVD - which I saw on someone's TV and now have to buy the  DVD to get the worthwile extras.
B000002WU9|5.0|this is the best solo release from a wu member this has the best production maybe even better than 36 chambers .All guest stars on this hold thier own especially ghost who is practically on every song and ghost and  rae collaborate with nas for the best song on the album verbal intercourse  if you want a mad album this is it.
B00004SCX6|3.0|This cd, to most people, would be a new chance for them to listen to their young pop star, Britney Spears. Yet, this album is not like the &quot;Baby one...&quot; Britney. Not like the Britney that brought us a new type of  way to listen to great music. This cd sounds like a failed attempt at  growing up. Althougt this album may sound like a hit, but  &quot;Oops..&quot; can't compare to &quot;Baby one...&quot;  on the  pleasure-to-ear chart. She made a mistake many artist in their primes  made---grow up too soon. Her entire approach to music changed with this  album. Buying it or not is your choice, but to be on the safe side, don't.  It would be a miracle for it to bring as much reat music that her  self-titled brought me.
B00000294R|5.0|big L what a lyrical genius he will be missed.get his new album on rawcus that album will also be a five miker.
B0000022WA|5.0|This has long been a favorite of mine. I saw this movie when I was 8yrs. old and now,16yrs. later,I still find myself periodically watching. <br />This is one of my guilty pleasure movies. Sure,I should be over this movie by  now,but hey,it's a chance to relive the innocence of childhood.<br />If you're  in the mood for something sweet,syrupy or family friendly,then this one is  well worth the money. Get it for the kids and secretly enjoy watching it  again.
B000023VR6|4.0|its been a long wait for the sequel to the chronic but it has been worth it. this album is easily a 4and a half you cant go wrong with this the production is amazing and the ryhmes are the shit.still snoop dogg and  dr.dre for sure biatch! go get this the chronic$$
B00002E23E|5.0|the concert is sloppy, the vocals sound off, almost half of the music was thrown in later from lack of composure. but this true rock concert mixed with fantasy sequences is the greatest from one of the greatest rock bands  ever. they spin through old and new. they attack &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;  and &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; Bonzo tears the house down with  &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; and the title track rings with urgency. yet the  greatest song, by far, is &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; there are  time-tested songs, and then there is a small group of songs that will  always ring with us. the greatest rock songs ever. the truest numbers on  earth, and &quot;Stairway&quot; is one of them. not only do they do it  justice live, but as Page stands and strums his double Gibson, the sonic  fury pours from his guitar. he lays down a solo that flat out rivals the  concert version of &quot;Free Bird&quot;, destroys the studio's version,  and reaches a height of spiritual proportions. the solo will give you  chills, and you can see in Page's face that there will never be a feeling  close to that one. standing up on stage, belting out that improv solo that  flows with electric fire. greatest song ever. great concert film.
B00004SCX6|1.0|this has to be one of the most overated albums ever briteny spears i just the product of a record company out to make money.this is a lot worse than her first album at least you can listen to it.this i just a bunch of realy  badly put together pop tunes dont waste your money.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I absolutely adore Sex and the City! It is has a new edge that captures your heart in romantic humor!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has certainly done it again with this great new album. Every single song on it is just as excellent as the first single off it, Oops I did it again. Theres fast funky songs and slow love songs so there's  something to please everyone. Even if you're not a big Britney fan buy this  album and you wont regret it.
B00000BKDX|5.0|This is Maiden at their best. Every song is awesome. The music and Bruce's vocals have so much power and energy. I for one do not like live albums. The vocals and music do not sound as good as the studio version, but I  digress this is an incredible live album. A Must Own, go and order it right  now.
B00000K19E|5.0|By far, this is the best DVD movie I own.  The video and sound effects are as good as it gets.  The story is packed with little hints and suggestions as to what is happening.  I'm still picking things up after the fifth time  I've watched the movie.  To own a dvd means that you will be watching it  many times, and finding something new in the story each time keeps this  movie top choice when selecting from my own library.  The movie is also  cheaper than most other DVD's, which I can't figure out.  Buy it, you won't  be disappointed.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Ironman's debut is one of the best Wu-Albums ever. His style is remarkable among millions of others and the production is just RZA. In my opinion, this is essential for any Wu-Tang fan, because Cappadonna sounds a lot  tighter than on his later Solo-Album. Get it!
B00003CXDV|4.0|I love on-going slap-stick that goes on through this movie.  Being a Trekkie, I think it was a funny portrayal of the Original Series, and Tim Allen captured his character greatly, who was extremely simialar to William  Shatner/James T. Kirk (in my opinion, that was the best part in the whole  movie).  I also enjoyed the performances of Enrico Colantoni, Sigourney  Weaver, Alan Rickman, and Tony Shalhoub.
B000001EAQ|4.0|Okay, all U2 fans out there, take a look back at some of U2's past works. The dance/groovy sounds of Achtung Baby and Zooropa, The Light/Old time rock sounds of Joshua Tree, Unforgetable Fire, and R&amp;H, and the  grungey, punk rock style you would expect from an early '80's band with  Boy,October, and War. Now, out of the blue, here comes this  techno/rock/grunge/punk/pop album all scrunched together in a 12 song  package the world calls Pop. Although just the title gives people the  impression of the type of music on the album, this album actually contains  rock/grunge songs, i.e. Do You Feel Loved, Wake Up Dead Man, Staring at the  Sun, and Gone, techno/pop songs like Discotheque, Mofo, Miami, Last Night  on Earth, and The Playboy Mansion, then there's that sort of song you don't  want to say their genre is light rock, but it actually is, however, songs  like If God Will Send His Angels, If You Wear That Velvet Dress, and Please  fit that description. <br />Well, I guess that pretty much sums up U2's latest  album. I'm not saying all the change over the years is bad, most of the  songs on this album are fun to listen to, and it's fresh new music.Songs I  most recommend: Staring at the Sun, Last Night on Earth, Please, Mofo, Wake  Up Dead Man, and Gone.
0517122707|5.0|This is the most brilliantly funny book ever written in the history of the world. There are no other opinions to have of this masterpiece. And anybody who believes differently is wrong and ought to be punished. I weep into my  horribly expensive 400 count Egyptian cotton pillowcase each time I think  that the writer extinguished his life without ever making it into the Oprah  Book Club. So much is wrong with life. This book, however, is something  that is right. All must read it and be awed.
B000001FXX|5.0|God I love this CD. Every song here is amazingly strong, with great Caribbean instruments mixed with Africanesque vocals. This is best listened to when you are laying back catching the Pacific vibe and riding it far  away. A clear concept album, Natty Dread takes a journey to the times of  Bob Marley, and reminds you how great of a musician he was. My favorite  tracks on here are Lively Up Yourself, No Woman No Cry, Natty Dread, and  Revolution. I love to just strap the headphones on and listen to this on a  sunny day where everything is perfect. Despite the fact that Marley  preaches a lot about social unrest, there are also many other elements that  make it the perfect &quot;vibe&quot; CD. The fact that it is not very dark,  can be listened to everywhere, and has influenced many present day  musicicans in many genres, such as punk, ska, rock, and jazz. Bob Marley  lives on in my heart when I can put on the masterpiece, Natty Dread.  Another great dub reggae artist is Jimmy Cliff, and an essential album from  him is the soundtrack to The Harder They Come.
0380002930|5.0|The subtitle is not entirely silly. Tolkien himself said that &quot;rabbit&quot; was one of the words lying behind &quot;hobbit.&quot; After all, llike hobbits, rabbits are insignificant little creatures whom  one doesn't associate with grand adventure, but who turn out to be tough  and resourceful nonetheless. I would be surprised to find anyone who loved  the Lord of the Rings but hates Watership Down. Like Tolkien and all good  heroic fantasy writers, Adams is interested in finding heroism and  adventure in unlikely places, and in the way hope springs out of despair  when we come to care about bringing salvation more than about being the  bringer of it. Watership Down is quite literally about finding adventure in  your own backyard. However, the place you, as a human, play in it is not  very heroic. We are, we learn, the most vicious among the  &quot;thousand,&quot; the enemies of rabbits. Unlike foxes, hawks, and  other natural enemies, we kill not just because we are hungry but because,  say, we are building a new housing development and a rabbit warren happens  to be in the way. One of the many excellencies of _Watership Down_ is the  way one identifies closely with the rabbits and then suddenly realizes,  &quot;but I'm human! I'm one of the Thousand Enemies!&quot; Perhaps this  will help us identify better with those human beings in history whose lives  have been like those of Adams's rabbits--a continual struggle for survival  against powerful oppressors. But mostly what one experiences in _Watership  Down_ is the sheer joy of Adams's creation, from the myths about the  trickster hero El'ahrairah, to the decadent rabbits who compose lyric  poetry and create works of art but have forgotten about heroism and  adventure (for a reason that I won't reveal), to the final, epic showdown  with the totalitarian dictator General Woundwort, to whom the tiny,  helpless prophet Fiver says with compassionate irony (given who seems to  have the power at the time): &quot;Believe me, I am sorry for your  death.&quot; And then there is the large and warlike Bigwig, who learns to  accept gracefully the superiority of the greatest of all the rabbits,  Hazel, whose leadership is based not on strength and fighting ability but  on the ability to think ahead and, most importantly, to sacrifice himself  for the others.
6305750750|5.0|Let me clear this up. Did you enjoy the first Star Wars as a kid? You did? Well, if you expect what you remembered as a kid, you're probably going to enjoy this film (my 40 year-old dad has watched this tape more than I  have!). If you expect a more mature Star Wars, you're going to be  disappointed.<br />This film is a pure graphical feast. I don't know how it  lost to the Matrix at the Oscars. There are so many stories behind the  story, so many things going on crammed into nearly every frame that its  impossible to take it all in in one viewing. And let me tell you, the  'saber battle at the end is one of the best fight scenes ever period!<br />I  feel that this film was made to introduce the new characters of this  trilogy. And it gets the job done, whether you love em (Qui-Gon) or hate em  (Jar Jar). But admittingly, the more I see this movie, the less I hate Jar  Jar. Sure he was VERY annoying at first, but after a few veiwings you can  actually understand what he is saying, which makes him a LITTLE less  annoying.<br />The only way to watch this video is by getting the widescreen  version. Sure it costs a bit more but its worth it. And the picture is  surprisingly good (especially the colour) for VHS. I can't wait to see what  they have in store for us with the DVD.<br />Anyway, this is a good Star Wars  film, even if it does stray from prevous films with the diolauge and such.  I can't wait to see Episodes 2 and 3!
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is a tapestry of its' own human weaving , dependent on human options for direction and solution .  ----there are no &quot;Gods&quot; or supernatural  &quot; givens &quot; here ...., this is the empowering of of individual  humans over group-think .

B000002GIE|1.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this album was released 5 years too late.It definitely would have been a big commercial sucsess in 1984 - 86. No matter the date of its release it is still absolute garbage.I only have  1000 words, so I'll sum it up to the best of my ability. The album, and the  band in general, had the 80's formula of - songs with no sustance/scorching  guitar - down pat. The lack of true songwriting ability is clear in that  they rely  on immature themes and cliche, such as not wanting to go to  school or being in love with the teacher.  What's worse is that this  infantile message is being deliverd through the voice of a singer with  absolutely no style. This guy thinks he's Freddie Mercury, I think he's  uhh..lets see who's the worst vocalist I can.. Oh yeah I think he's Gary  Cherone, the vocalist of Extreme.I'm sorry, I digress.   Moving on. The  guitar work, to the guitarist Nuno Bentencourts credit, is very good.  Although at first listen he sounds like an Eddie Van Halen clone, he's  actually a bit more than that. In addition to that if you think about all  of the Van Halen clones out there at the time this guy is head and  shoulders above them. Summary: Bad album, bad band, horrible vocalist, good  guitar. The total pakage for the 80's phobe.
0140282033|5.0|Weird-and delicious-things begin to happen when a mysterious woman, her small daughter...and her daughter's imaginary cat-friend appear in a small town in Provence on the first day of Lent. Their mission? To open a  chocolatiere-right across the street from a highly disapproving priest.  Soon, everyone in town has a strongly held opinion about the woman, her  past and the shop which produces the wickedly enticing sweets as if  by...magic. Engrossing, amusing and enlightening all at once, CHOCOLAT is a  book that will drive the reader to the kitchen to whip up double  bittersweet chocolate mousse brownies while reading along. One bite-you'll  be hooked!
6303422020|3.0|What can I say. Creepshow (the first one) is a classic...well done, great stories, cameo appearance by Stephan King (this is often a trademark of movies made from his novels and stories), and a well constructed connecting  'wrapper' about a young boy who buys EC comics (didn't we all?)<br />I  expected more of the same with Creepshow II, but was disappointed. The  movie contains three shorts as compared to five in the first release - and  the quality is not the same. There's more gore -- but a lot of blood and  gore do not (inof itself) a good movie make.<br />Additionally, these stories  were more mundane and usual than the ones in the first film. By far the  best was &quot;The Raft&quot;. The last one about the hitchhiker is an  overdone theme, originally from a Twilight Zone episode, which has appeared  in many anotholgies since. Hey guys, let's do something different! Lots of  other b&amp;w pulp horror shorts are available.<br />Well, I can't really  recommend this one whole-heartily, though I will probably buy it when it is  available on DVD (because I DID enjoy the first release and I tend to  complete collections). Folks who enjoy the genre will probably want it to  fill out their libraries. Just be aware that there are better titles  available for the money.<br />~P~
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is the one that changed everything in the music scene..every song on here is crafted beautifully. from the well known and overplayed &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot; to &quot;breed&quot; to the  punk/hardcore grunge of &quot;teritorrial pissings&quot; this album says  agnst and pain,its like a release. Kurt Cobain and the gang created a  wonderful album, full of emotion. they connected with many people just by  writing honestly. if you dont own this album you should, definitely a gem.  Lyrically this album is moving, musically its compelling. By far, one of  the greatest albums of the last decade. R.I.P. Kurt Cobain.  Peace,Love,Empathy,~David
0375501851|2.0|This is a fine first novel and shows signs of real promise-- it's witty, thoughtful and there's lots of energy on display. But it ain't the cherries jubilee the reviewers have made it out to be. Too long, too pleased with  its own verbal-strutting, the novel is more like a show and tell of  dialects and set pieces than a cohesive hole. And it does tend to go on and  on and on when Smith finds a character or a subject she's hooked on. One  day she'll write a terrific book. This isn't it.
1558908498|5.0|Despite what many people have said when reviewing this film,i still firmly believe that it is in fact the best out of the three.Sure Scream is a classic and an awesome film but this one i felt added more color into the plot and the cast was well chosen.I loved the opening scene,Jada's tortured  and surprised face while she unleashes thet petrofying scream was  awesome!And as for the ending i personally think it's genius.You may not be  able to figure out who the killer is but hey, that's what the scream films  are all about right? All my friends who saw this film loved it so this is  not just my opinion...I give it a thumbs up.
B000005ZGZ|5.0|Strike up another great one for Ian and Guy. 13 Songs and Repeater are still my favorites, but this one is very unique and a little more experimental.The opening track should be enough proof for ya. Great cover  too.
6305903182|5.0|Well,let me start by saying that this is one of the best trilogies EVER alongside The Godfather and Alien ones.The first movie started it all and it was excellent,the second continued with the same brilliance(and in my  opinion was the best of the 3) and now..part 3.This is a great finish to a  great series:it's smart,cunning,funny and is VERY  different,mood-wise,  from the other two becoming a unique film instead of just the third and  final link to a trilogy.The only bad thing i can say about it is that i  thought it was very funny but not scary enough,i never jumped off my seat  as i did in a few occasions in the previous films..still though scream was  never The Exorcicst or The Blair Witch to begin with so fans of the series  will love it anyway,the rest i don't know.Bottom line:if you loved the  other two go buy this one,it's a true jem.Either that or wait for a trilogy  box-set,hopefully sometime very soon!
B0000024KQ|4.0|umm, this is an extreme undergroud cd. all of that stuff you thought was under like wu-tang which really isn't unless your refering to 36 chambers...thats not even undergroud compared to this.  these guys speek  their mind and let go what they please.  if your looking for something  where the artist speeks his mind and doesn't have much flow with the music  then go w/ this cd by onyx.  this is a group that doesn't flow like what a  good example is, is bone thugs n harmony, they don't flow like that, its  kinda against the grind...if thats your type of music or u got other stuff  by onyx. go get this album, its great.
0783235607|5.0|When I was a little kid, Psycho scared the living daylights out of me. It didn't make me afraid of showers so much but afraid of lonely roadside motels.  Psycho is the forerunner of the modern horror movie. If not for  this movie, we wouldn't have all the other movies such as Halloween and  Scream. I just watched this with my girlfriend the other day. She was  totally blown away. She gasped and covered her eyes and had her mouth  hanging open when she discovered Norman's secret. I noticed a few people  put some bad reviews of Psycho on here. Now they have a right to their  opinion but come on! Psycho has terrible acting?   Give me a break! If this  isn't good acting then what is?  Besides there are only a few bad reviews  of this classic movie. As much as these unenlightened people want to  denounce Psycho they cant erase the fact that it has stood for 40 years now  as a classic thriller. Now the majority isnt always right but when it comes  to movies they usually are. And if Psycho is a bad movie with terrible  acting, then how come EVERY single professional critic I look up gave  Psycho their highest rating? Even Leonard Maltin did who is a very picky  critic. Sorry, Negative Nancys but they didnt get to be professionals by  giving good reviews to bad movies. Psycho lives on. And if you dont like it  go watch I Know What You Did Last Summer.
0002197286|5.0|This book help me a lot during several bird trips on my first visit to Europe in 1999. I have travelled in several countries. Sometimes with very keen birders, other times alone. It would be impossible for me to be in the  field in conditions to identify so many birds, without this valuable book.  Excellent pictures. It's my new standard on international field guides.
B000003TA4|5.0|Well, im usually a SLipKnot, Korn, Godsmack type fan, but this is an awesome album. My friend, he likes all the softer bands like Pearl Jam, and Led Zeppelin, and Grateful Dead, and he also likes Nirvana. He played me  Smells like Teen SPirit, and i thought it was crap. But then i listened to  the song again and i loved it. I learned how to play the song on my guitar,  and i listened to the whole cd. The whole cd is intense. I recommend this  cd to Everyone.
B00003W8NM|5.0|there are plenty of great movies worthy of owning for multiple viewing purposes.  before the release of this dvd, i thought the honor for best dvd should go to 12 monkeys (featuring a great documentary on the making of the  movie).  however, this blows away all twelve of them.  once you open the  packaging and see the care that went into the cover art, you'll know you  made the right choice.  all the extras that you'll find will prove that  this packs just as much punch on the inside.  whether you like the movie or  not, i think everyone would agree that the extras on this disk are nothing  short of amazing; nothing was overlooked by these guys.  please, buy this  dvd.  do any states acknowledge marriages between men and their dvds?   because if so, i'm gonna do some serious love-making to this truly  revolutionary disk.
B00000064G|5.0|The V.W. commercial was surprising and certainly some snobs will be critical of the use of a Nick Drake song for a car commercial.In some ways you can count me in that camp however if it brings more people discover his  beautiful music then that is great.

B00004U5SC|5.0|Ladd is at his best. It has all the qualities of a great western.Palance is a great villian, I wanted to shoot him myself. A truly classic film I can't wait to add this to my dvd collection.I would reccomend this film to  any movie lover.
B00000IPAX|5.0|this has got to be one of the best albums i have ever bought. if you like punk you'll like this if you don't like punk you may like this to. thesongs are all different and once you've listened to them once you can't get them out of yor head. the superb drumming by travis on anthem and the... guitar playing on 'aliens exist'by tom, truly makes this album worth every  penny. but i suggest that you listen to some of the other songs before you  purchase it if you are buying it just because you like 'all the small  things' that song is not like all the others. my favorite songs are 'adams  song' , aliens exist, mutt and wendy clear but the rest are all as good. if  you are contemplating buying this album i suggest you do, you won't regret  it. katie
B000002I2M|5.0|My brother got this for me at christmas, I listened to it a bit(I thought Morrison sounded wierd), then I took it to D.C. with me and I listened to it all the time!  It's a great rock/blues cd and a must for any 60's music  fan like me!I love the doors a lot and I love 60's music and blues, this is  a really great blues and rock album,  so I think anyone who likes that  stuff should definitly get it!
B000002UB3|5.0|On this album you will find some of the greatest songs from the 20th century. The Beatles are going threw a very though period at this time, but they keep on making fantastic music. Sir Paul McCartney is the main person  behind this album, with classics like &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; and  &quot; You`ll Never Give Me Your Money&quot;. John Lennon who I suspect is  thinking more on his solo carrier is not able to make songs as he did  before, but &quot;The dark horse&quot;, George Harrison makes two songs  that set me in a very special mood; &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and of  course the beautiful &quot;Something&quot;.
B000002KAG|5.0|This album is interesting for its curiosity. It's a great album, but you can tell that the suits had something to do with the content. It's fun and frivolous in the same way early Beatles were (not much in common musically,  however). To really understand what the Dead became and were, try Live  Dead. Five stars because it's still the Dead.
079073382X|5.0|BEFORE SUNRISE always reminds me of the way my wife and I courted each other. The dialog is utterly perfect, as is the acting. Had Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpie married in real life, I would have understood. The story is so  well told by the director that the audience itself loses track of time and  truly lives the evening with the two principle characters. The closing  sequence, in which the camera pans back to many of the key sites of  conversation, is overwhelmingly poignant, as is the fade out as we watch  the faces contemplating what has just happened. This is a film which, frame  by frame, I would label perfect. It is Linklater's best so far. The poetry,  romance, and bumbling awkwardness of young love has never been so lovingly  portrayed in film. Watch it again and again: it holds up so well!
B00000AFDW|2.0|This is supposed to be the big reunion album right?  Well, you will be interested to know that Ace Frehley said that he only played on half the album and Peter, like on DYNASTY, only played drums on one song, &quot;Into  the void&quot;.  &quot;We are one&quot; is a good song but most of the  album is very cheesy and lacking in the originality and raw sound of 1970s  KISS.  It's obvious that they arent together on this record, it doesent  sound anything like the old KISS.  Don't get me wrong KISS is one of a kind  but even they admitted it's over musically.  Stick to the 1970s recordings.   Anything from KISS(1974) to DYNASTY(1979).  PSYCHO CIRCUS is not essential  nor is it a fair introduction to this phenomenal group.
B000001EKX|4.0|HOTTER THAN HELL(1974)is probably the most important remaster because it may have needed it the most.  There is no other album that has the gritty, nasty, sound that this one does.  More classics from ALIVE!(1975) are here,  like &quot;Got to choose&quot;, &quot;Hotter&quot;, &quot;Let me go&quot;,  and one of my personal favorites, &quot;Parasite&quot;.  The album also  features some great lesser known gems like &quot;Comin' home&quot;,  &quot;Goin' blind&quot;, and &quot;Strange ways&quot;, probably one of the  heaviest KISS songs.  HOTTER THAN HELL was recorded differently than any  other album but it stands out because of it.  The follow up to the classic  debut KISS(1974) won't let you down.  Another KISS essential.
B000002N2Z|5.0|when i first hard 7 words and my own summer i was hooked on the deftones. my friend got me adreneline for christmas this last year. i was really excited. but for a while all i listened to was bored and 7 words. i  progressivly moved more and more into a metal loving craze. i got into  system of a down, korn, (old) limp bizkit, slipknot, etc. etc. and i was  skipping around, just listening to whatever came on, engine # 9 came on. i  listened more and more to the album, loving it more and more. songs on this  album are great, the variety of music ranges from rap/death metal to emo  like music like tool, or a perfect circle. this is a cd that will grow on  you if u arent into metal that much, it will get u hooked, and you will get  sucked into a downward sprial of deftone-al tunes. my favorite tracks are  engine # 9, 7 words, root, and minus blindfold.
B000002NIW|5.0|I love this CD. The Deftones are one of the best bands out there and I think it's a shame that they haven't gotten the exposure that they deserve. I would have to say that this is the better of their 2 CD's that they have  out so far. Adrenaline is still an awesome album but Around the Fur is a  lot heavier and I like Chino's vocals on this album better. Don't get me  wrong or anything I mean both Deftones albums are masterpieces, but I just  prefer this one over Adrenaline. The best songs are My Own Summer(Shove  It), Around The Fur, Rickets, Lotion, and my personal favorite Headup. I  would highly recommend that you pick up this CD and Adrenaline as well. I  can't wait until White Pony comes out, but until it does I still have  Adrenaline and Around the Fur to jam to.
0792151712|1.0|We are led to believe an attractive older looking young woman would fawn over a 12 year old little boy (okay, her fiancee is bad too) and the other characters are also a repository for bad acting. The plot is overly  sacharine and the best part of the movie comes when Jack bites it<br />Please  do not confuse this movie with reality, there never was a Rose or Jack  Dawson on the ship and James Cameron invented 95 percent of the facts up as  he went along. I'm just gratefull the radio stations are no longer playing  this movie's horrid sound track .
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd is the best cd I have ever listened to. If you liked the Slim Shady LP you will love this one. Eminem is a lot bolder in this album and speaks out. The only problems I found on this album is the tracks &quot;Ken  Kaniff&quot; Just because It is nasty. And &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;  the only reason I don't like this song is because Radio and MTV have played  it out and It just is annoying now.  The best song is Number 7 which is   &quot;The Way I Am&quot; which really is a great beat with tight lyrics. If  you thought Slim Shady LP was pushing it you're going to be blown away by  the Marshall Mathers LP!
B0000062Y2|5.0|As a fan of this music ever since I first heard it 25 years ago, having seen it in numerous productions over the years, and by owning the various recordings from stage and screen, I strongly feel that this -- the 1973  recording from the Norman Jewison film -- is the finest of them all.  Ted  Neeley's interpretation of Jesus is never &quot;wimpy&quot;; rather, it is  dramatic, powerful, sensitive, and real -- especially in Gethsemane.   Similarly, Barry Dennen's interpretation of Pilate is starkly engaging and  believable.  Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elliman also are excellent here;  their work clearly (and appropriately) has influenced subsequent  performances.  Get this recording, listen to it, and feel it:  you will not  be disappointed.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This cd is the best album i have ever heard! The rhymes are off the hook with phat beats. The only two tracks I dont like is Ken Kaniff because it makes me sick, and The Real Slim Shady because I have heard it so many  times that it is just annoying. Radio and MTV and BET have ruined an  awesome song. The best song on the whole album is definitely &quot;The Way  I Am&quot; Number 7 it has the phattest lyrics with the tightest beat ever.  Stan is also good because it proves Eminem can show a seriousness to  himself. I like &quot;Criminal&quot; too. I really like the interlude in  the middle of it.  If you like the Slim Shady LP and thought it was pushing  the limits The Marshall Mathers LP will blow you away!

B00000J7J4|5.0|Within the space of about seven hours I witnessed a virtuoso performance and another one that made a lot of people cringe. Maybe, the premise for this piece starts a couple of days earlier, when Kobe Bryant 'showed up' big time in overtime of the fourth game for the Los Angeles Lakers and  helped put them up 3-1 in the best of seven series. All over ESPN and  nba.com the words describing the man whom everyone has chosen as successor  to Michael Jordan were superlative and even while a few experts were  cautious about hailing the second coming of His Airness (third to be  politically correct if you count the fact that  Jordan came back once  before) everyone was quick to call it the game where the boy became the  man.<br />And then there was Game 5.<br />But before that, there was a music  concert on HBO here in India  - a rerun of an earlier telecast.  It was  Carlos Santana in support of his 'Supernatural' album. I had other things  to watch all over television but I kept getting pulled back to the  virtuosity of the man who is enjoying one of the biggest comebacks of all  time. And in that comeback he's teaching us an important lesson that might  have served young Kobe well in Game 5. The magic of Supernatural on CD is  that it feels like a really hip compilation album with the likes of Dave  Matthews and Everlast doing a great job of rubbing shoulders with Lauryn  Hill, Rob Thomas and Eric Clapton. 'Supernatural' is a team effort (and  what a  team!) and that's why it stands up tall against other offerings   from 1999. In concert though, it was apparent how the string wizardry of   King Carlos was what held the uneven performances together and the ease  with which he switched from an acoustic to his flame-hued Les Paul was, in  itself, awesome. Through all the music, the mind-bending solos and even the  high point of the production - when Rob Thomas joined him onstage for  'Smooth' I was struck by how much the sound of the album (and the concert)  is dependent onthe 'showing up' of all of Santana's support musicians.  <br />So yes, Kobe showed up big time in Game 4 and if he hadn't the team  would've been facing a 2-2 situation with the three point-rich Pacers but  that didn't mean that Kobe was suddenly supposed to believe his press  release. He took the ball to the hole as if Shaq was back on the bench and  for all his zipping in and out of the zone his score sheet wasn't something  that even the MIA Dennis Rodman would've shrugged about. Of course Kobe  Bryant has been hailed as an unusual talent ever since he started playing  in the NBA as an 18-year-old but the big man in front has been doing it for  about a third of Kobe's life! Bryant needs to defer to the Blaq Supaman if  LA is going to get it done in one of the next two games and bring home the  championship.<br />Surely Shaq can't do it all alone as was proved by another  35 point and 12 rebound performance that was the only Lakers' high point in  a 33 point loss to the resurgent Pacers. But Shaq had fewer looks at the  basket in earlier parts of the game because Bryant and a couple of the  other Lakers were too busy inventing new ways to hit the rim hard and  ineffectively. It was akin to having Rob Thomas play guitar on Smooth  himself ! Just not on. <br />The most important thing about being in a team is  knowing what your role is and playing it to perfect. In Game 4 Kobe knew;  in Game 5 he thought he was starring in the sequel. <br />Not treating every  new day as different - always a bad idea. Santana in the meantime is the  new king of self-reinvention...
0345428064|2.0|I guess it doesn't surprise me that the intellectual level of what one  assumes must be an average SAS operator is fairly low. Given the political  dirtbags who run such agencies these days, McNab probably quite accurately  represents the conformity of thought and uncritical mindset of killers for  hire.<br />Tradecraft? Well, I'd love to see a veteran OSS operative run  circles around this bozo.<br />It's an interesting read if only for a look  into the British soul. It reminds me once again why I feel revulstion  towards most Brits; so thank you, McNab.<br />As a purely technical criticism,  directed more to the editors than the author, it's always a good idea to  have an ending in a book. This one just sort of stops.... Maybe the last  couple chapters got lost somewhere?

0679735259|5.0|It is not the content the distinguishes Michael Herr's &quot;Dispatches,&quot; it is the delivery.  Herr is an excellent reporter who risked life and limb to cover the Vietnam War.  The book is his account  of what he saw there.  What he saw was young American soldiers, far from  home fighting a war few of them understood against an frustratingly elusive  enemy.  If this sounds like the subject matter for many Vietnam books, it  is.  But Herr's writing is so evocative ans so powerful that many of his  descriptions will stay with you for a long time after you've put it down.  Along with Phillip Caputo's &quot;A Rumor of War,&quot; and Fredrick  Downs's &quot;The Killing Zone,&quot; this is one of the best personal  accounts of the Vietnam War available.
B00000IQC8|4.0|In Kevin Smith's debut, he makes it a number one hit. It's hilarious and just a full blown witty comedy.<br />Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is called in to work on Saturday at the Quick Stop, even though he's not supposed to  be there. He's promised that it will be done by noon so he can go play  hockey at two in the afternoon. During this long day at the Quick Shop  Dante debates with his friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) who works at RST  Video's next store, he plays hockey on the roof, he fights with his  girlfriend, makes up with an older ex-girlfriend, goes to a funeral, and  much more. This movie is outrageously funny. There's never been anything  like it, and there never will. Of course Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob  (Kevin Smith) are great to have around. Very funny movie, I recommend this  to anyone and everyone. Great, great, great film.
0060975768|5.0|Reading retired Lt. General Harold Moore's account of the early days of American intervention in Vietnam, one cannot help but feel a bit of frustration.  Though the misguided &quot;search and destroy&quot; that  characterized America's initial efforts in Vietnam led to the near disaster  that was the battle of Ia Drang, it was Moore's remarkably effective  leadership that prevented the battle from being an American disaster.  The  irony is that the battle taught some very important lessons that the top  American leadership failed to learn until after the Tet offensive.  By  then, they had exhausted the goodwill that had previously existed on the  home front.  Moore's account of the battle is riveting and is one of the  most compelling accounts to come out of the war.  Anyone with an interest  in military history should read it.
6304233639|2.0|Here is another example of a movie that can be mildly diverting despite its single-minded desire to pluck the brain right out of its audience's collective head.  Big, loud, and VERY dumb, Independence Day does have some  pretty cool aliens and some decent spfx scenes.  However, it has so many  lame one-liners that we are left to ponder whether we are watching a sci-fi  flick or Amateur Night At the Apollo.  Good actors are wasted in roles that  are sketchy and cliched at best.  The score is pretty bad as well; all  noise and no emotion. Its sad to see so much money wasted on something so  lousy. Perhaps films like this exist solely to entertain.  Maybe the  critics should just lighten up, shut off their brains and enjoy.  But, then  again, maybe we, as an audience, should stop pouring our time and cash into  movies that are slapped together without a trace of thought or creativity.   This is definitely one of them.
038533348X|4.0|End-of-the-world fiction is probably my favorite fiction genre, and I found Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; to be by far the most bizzare addition to my library in this area.  My interpretation is that it is  suppose to be taken in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's black comedy film  &quot;Dr. Strangeglove.&quot;  Not only was it written around the same time  at the height of the Cold War, it has the same high farce tone about it.  Vonnegut's ultimate fate for the world is sheer genius, though when it  finally happens, it seems almost like an afterthought.  Vonnegut's book is  a challenging read and one that is not for everybody.  Nevertheless, you'll  find yourself thinking about it long after you've put it down.
0671015206|3.0|This book is like the Bible to some and pure garbage to others, depending on what you expect. This book is essentially a (long winded) study about the lifestyles of people whose net worth is over one million USD. Most of  the people mentioned do not live in the Hollywood Fantasyland, but live a  middle-class everyday lives with the satisfaction of being your own boss,  paying all the bills without trouble, having no mentionable debt and not  having to worry about your financial future. The book is NOT a self help  guide, though you can read between the lines and use it as such; Mainly,  don't use all your earnings, save at least 25% of your gross earnings and  invest them wisely. Use the rest of your earnings to pay for a  middle-class, common lifestyle without any fancy trappings. Keep your  friends and neighbours in the dark from the truth about your net assets.  <br />If you want a self help book to become rich yourself, this book can help  but is it the best one out there? No it is not. One good example of a much  better book for that purpose is &quot;Eight Steps To Seven Figures&quot;.  It is clearly a self help book, a real how-to guide. And it is more fun;  Instead of having faceless statistics of a supposed study, it gives the  names and faces of many self-made millionaires. It is more fun to read and  makes more sense.

B00003CXAT|1.0|I think I should begin by stating that I am not a fan of the action film.   Though my life has been called &quot;adventurous&quot; by many, and,  indeed, I feel it is, action and adventure stories, and by that I mean  plots that wholly rely on action and adventure, have never appealed to me.   I prefer developed characters and insight and rich themes.  Jurassic Park,  besides an interesting scientific idea, produced none of these.  <br />I saw  the film in France.  Sitting in the darkened theatre, as the film began, I  heard cries from the lobby and hurried footsteps.  Immediately I stood, as  did others in the audience.  Several of us took tentative steps from our  seats and began to walk towards the door leading to the lobby, to find out  what was happening.  At that moment the fire alarm pierced the air.  As the  T-rex ate the lawyer (the one aspect of the film I liked) the door burst  open and several men in black suits and masks ran in, guns firing.  A man  thirty feet away from me: his body stiffened and then convulsed, as though  struck by lightening, and fell limply to the floor.  I kneeled down in the  semi-darkness and crawled in between seats.  There were gun shots that I  could tell came from an automatic.  On both sides of the screen then, I  thought, an adventure is unfolding.  And then, a thunderous crash rocked  the whole building and threw me out into the aisle.  Plaster fell from the  ceiling like snowflackes.  A few theaters down, I could hear fire  crackling.  Several of the masked men ran towards the exit at the front of  the theatre.  One tripped over me.  Before he could reach for his gun I  leapt onto him and grabbed his shirt collar and threw him into some seats.   We grappled for some seconds.  The police then rushed in, there were more  gunshots, the man with whom I fought suddenly flew off me and landed  several feet ahead.  I collapsed.  Once the building was cleared, I sat  down and watched the rest of the film, which was nonsensical and stupid.
0380973464|5.0|This will be at least as influential as &quot;Snow Crash,&quot;  a book that changed the nature of virtual online chatrooms.  Of all his published works, this one is the most inticately dramatic.  It covers 950 pages over  50 years. I find myself reading up on codes (a subject I previously thought  boring), and noticing an upsurge in offshore data haven IPO's.  Stephenson  has become the Jules Verne prophet of the cyberpunk set, leaving William  Gibson in the dust.  Out of the last 5 books, two will become classics, not  a bad record at all.  Lookout Sterling, this author has really found his  stride!  Right now, he's the best of the genre and this is his best book  yet!  Ignore it at your own future peril.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Scary how much the title track sounds like her first album.  I'm so tired of hearing love and relationships rationalized into bubblegum melodies (I grew up in the age of New Kids...can't help that).  Musically, this album pretty much stinks.  Is there anything more to music (esp. pop) that has  nothing to do with electronic beats and computerized music?  I made the  mistake of buying this cd... By the way I'm 22 years old, and not 50, so I know plenty about the bubblegum.  Chao!
B00004SVID|3.0|After hearing of this release, I was rather excited. While The Wall is not my favorite Pink Floyd CD (Wish You Were Here gets that honor), it contains some of my favorite songs. And, Pink Floyd stuff usually sounds better  live.<br />While the packaging is stellar (as usual from Storm Thorgerson), I  found the sound quality and mixing to be lacking. For a live release, the  crowd noise is almost non-existent. For example, after hearing live tapes  of the Wall being played in New York in 1980, when Comfortably Numb began,  you could hardly hear the music because the crowd was going insane. Here,  the crowd isn't even there. The whole recording sounds very un-energetic to  me. As I said, I usually enjoy live Floyd renditions better than their  studio counterparts, but I can't say that for even a single song on this  disc - I'd much rather listen to the studio version.<br />Still, it is very  interresting to have an official live CD of this - if only the sound was  better.
B000002C2E|5.0|Approaching this album as an admirer (but certainly not a dedicated fan), I was not prepared for the impact it would have on me. Here is an album, released at a time when most artists would be wrapping up their careers,  that is as strong as anything he has ever done. While a few tracks manage  to get the foot tapping in pleasure, the CD overall is full of regret,  lamentation, sadness, and the inevitable approach of death. Sung with grit  and passion, the songs demonstrate that there are indeed second acts in the  lives of Americans (and musicians). Dylan is one of the few artists  remaining who has lyrics worth listening to (each song is like an intimate  story told by an old friend) and for anyone interested in understanding how  all of us are burdened by the past, pick up this disc immediately. Dylan's  scars are well-earned and he commands our attention with every note.
B00004TL2N|4.0|One may be shocked after realizing that Pierre Boulez's recording of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (VPO) is clocked at 76 minutes using the Robert Hass edition of the score.  Yet, on the other hand, we find Carlo Maria Giulini's recording of the same work, with the same VPO, and under the same Deutsche Grammophon label, clocked at 87 minutes, but using the Leopold Novak edition.  The former too fast, the latter too slow? To those acquainted with other recordings of the  masterpiece under either editions (Karajan, Wand, Tennstedt, Horenstein, Barenboim), perhaps.<br /><br />Yet, Giulini's recording of Bruckner's Eighth retains its architectural breadth, never dragging, but forward-moving  and constantly involving. It has that eternal feel to it. Boulez' approach of the work is comparatively more dynamic and propulsive in the Tennstedt style and mannerism. It does not feel hurried, for there are many moments of conscientious subtlety and phraseology that is well thought-out. The trio section of the scherzo movement  and the adagio are beautifully shaped and rendered. And the Vienna strings, not so alluring and rich as in the Karajan or Bernstein days, nonetheless sounds rather  smooth and silky. Its woodwinds are crisp and eloquent and the brass, while not as imposing as it was back in then, is nevertheless well blended.<br /><br />To celebrate the centenary of Bruckner's death, Boulez and the VPO decided to record the symphony in Bruckner's church in St. Florian during the International Bruckner Festival (St. Florian is near Linz, where Bruckner made his name as an organist before moving to Vienna in 1874). Church acoustics generally tend to be atmospheric and reverberate (and the recording team for BMG/Red Seal in Wand's performance brings that quality quite literally to your face, so spacious and muddled the sound is). The Deutsche Grammophon engineering team, however, eschews the traditional big-boned DG sound we have grown accustomed to for the sound that is more leaner yet more immediate (compare this with Karajan's reading or Levine's recording of \\"The Planets\\" and the difference could not be anymore apparent). Some may find, as I did, the sound to be a bit too congested and its dynamic range quite constricted and lacking timbre (the cymbal clashes in the adagio's glorious climax are barely noticeable). But play this disc in a moderate or higher volume, the listening experience can actually be more rewarding (and even thrilling in places).<br /><br />That said, Boulez's thoroughly humane reading of the score does nothing in disguising its spirituality, and that is a major plus if we are going to stay attention to the music while absorbing the essence of it, and of the man who wrote it.<br /><br />Recommendable.n accustomed to for the sound that is more leaner yet more immediate (compare this with Karajan's reading or Levine's recording of \\"The Planets\\" and the difference could not be anymore apparent).

6304602979|5.0|When I first saw this movie my friend had invited me to watch it with him and his girlfriend. I thought that because of the name that it was going to be some chick flick. The ensuing story and scene to scene action is unbelievable.       First you have Slater's charachter, a down to earth cat  with a twist. He's not really cool to anyone but himself and Alabama. It's  easy to identify with his easy lifestyle.      Then what realy hooks you is  Alabama. She has a slight irregularity with her teeth that let's you know  even though she is super hot, she is not above being human.      What seals  this movie is the beating Alabama takes for her lover, an ordinary cat with  an obssesion for Elvis.
0451191153|4.0|Looking at the recent reviews, I realize that many reviewers have been giving this book fairly bad reviews. Yet, deep down, this doesn't really surprise me. The fact is, when it comes to philosophy-type literature,  perspective and experience makes  a big difference, and many people aren't  finding something worthwhile in Ayn Rand. However, this book can't be  passed off simply as the crazy philosophical ravings of an offbeat author-  there is much more here than may meet the eye at first.<br />Most things about  this book are very complicated- especially the characters. You'll probably  end up wondering why they make the choices they do; often, you'll be  completely taken aback by the strangeness in them. However, upon closer  inspection, they are all very realistic, and all very solid. You just need  to invest the time and effort to do this.<br />This book also has a fairly  good plot to it- the ending, while left open, is fairly satisfying, and the  climaxes are well put together. And, I must say, the antagonist of the  story is one of the best in literature history- seemingly innocent and  weak, yet at the same time powerful and very evil. And the dialogue is  incredible- it's realistic, but not in any way boring. It's well ahead of  its time, just like Ms. Rand. <br />The best thing about this book is that it  provides so many untraditional ideas to think about. While many reviewers  didn't like this book because they disagreed with it, it offers many ideas  that can expand your horizons. I would say to read this with an open mind,  and don't worry about everything you read. Some of it may seem more  passable than other parts- the best thing to do is to take what you want to  and leave the rest.<br />Overall, this is a good read, and in the long run is  rewarding. If you don't get too deep into every dynamic of the philosophy,  you will probably enjoy it more.
B00003W8NM|4.0|As you may have heard, Fight Club did not win the hearts of all those movie critics that we so look up to. However, I believe the opinion of the public is more applicable to the home viewer.<br />This is a great movie!  Edward Norton as always is marvelous. He plays a slightly neurotic  insomniac trying to find the meaning in his life. He is addicted to the  home shopping network and tries to buy his happiness by filling his home  with everything he could possibly want. But it's not until he starts going  to various support groups for illnesses he doesn't have, that he begins to  feel he has a meaning to his life. Until one day he meets Tyler Durgen  (Brad Pitt) and everything changes. Remember that line: &quot; I want you  to hit me as hard as you can.&quot; From here on it is a roller coaster  ride exploring what men will really do to find their sense of self,  especially if they do not care what others may think, or what consequences  may come about. Ed's character soon gets in way over his head and by this  time, there's no turning back...<br />This film also has an ambitious visual  style. Everything from Norton walking through a catalogue,(prices and all)  to some weird dream sequences. Oh!, and don't forget to look for the  &quot;hidden&quot; Brad Pitts. In several shots if you see a quick flash of  orange, or think something flashed on the screen, rewind, pause a few  seconds before, and then go frame by frame. You will see Brad Pitt's  character pop on the screen for a single frame in several spots in the  movie.<br />Ok, if you have decided to watch this movie, be prepared to do a  lot of thinking once it's over. On the social commentary, and what it says  about us as people. And then of course there's that shocker ending, that  will make you rethink the entire movie..........
B0000399WI|5.0|I actually saw this movie before I read the book, like most people did. In fact, I doubt many people read the book at all; in case you were wondering, it's by Stephen King.<br />Now hold on, don't leave yet. Stephen King has  written some pretty bad stuff before, but this isn't bad at all. It's an  incredible story, and the movie is even better. It's the best prison drama  ever made. It's a must see for anyone who loves great movies.<br />In this  wonderful screen adaption, Andrew Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is a  young banker who is convicted of killing his wife. At first everything  points to him as the suspect, and a Maine jury has no problem convicting  him of the crime. Andrew, or Andy, as he becomes known, is sent of to  Shawshank, a Maine prison, to live out his life sentence. At first Andy  doesn't fit in, but soon the convicts around him begin to respect him for  his persistence in trying to become free. He makes friends with a man  called Red (played by Morgan Freeman), a man who can get things. This  friendship grows, and soon becomes very strong. You begin to realize, as  the plot plays out, that Andy may not be guilty.<br />In the end, this is a  movie about hope, about never giving up. Andy strives to succeed, even in  the looming shadow of the cruel warden. The acting in this film is great,   enough so to match the plot. It is a true classic, one that everyone needs  to see.
B000002B2X|4.0|This CD is neat...I guess...but it's dreadfully short for 10 bucks. And the music isn't even great stuff like Jar of Flies! It's sort of dark...but then again, so is my closet. I suppose it's got some neato songs on it, but  you'd be better off buying it used!
B00004THAY|3.0|I'll give you my first impressions. I've only listened all the way through a couple of times, so my opinion may change after I've lived with it a while.<br />        Somehow I was hoping for a BB King album that featured  Clapton, but what we have here is an actual collaboration as peers. This  could have worked very well but what you hear sometimes sounds like a  Clapton album and other times like a BB King album, not a unification of  two great talents. If you are an equal fan of both this may strike you as  good news, but for me it gives the album an uneven feel. What would have  been better, IMO, is if both had worked to step out of their boxes ala  &quot;When Love Comes To Town&quot;, BB's outstanding collaborative effort  with U2 from Rattle And Hum. Instead we have a summit meeting that mostly  goes over some pretty common ground.<br />        That said, there are some  real gems and great moments scattered throughout. The high point for me is  Help The Poor. Always a great tune, the loping rhythm section here makes it  sound fresh again. Another tune that sticks with me is Doyle III's Marry  Me. As much funk as blues, it has a great feel and BB sounds like he was  really into it. In fact, BB's voice is probably the strongest and most  consistent component of all of this. He's singing as good as he ever has,  and carries the album over the bumps. Long live BB King! As for the guitar  playing, it seems surprisingly subdued and downplayed by both. Not a lot of  cutting loose here. BB sounds his usual self on his solos: tasty and  understated ala Jimmie Vaughan (I guess that would really be the other way  around). But Clapton never really seems to find the pulse. EC has played  some of the best blues I've ever heard, but I'm not hearing it here. I  always get the sense that when Eric is not really connecting emotionally  with the material that he reverts to &quot;noodling&quot; mode (I'd give my  eye-teeth to noodle as well as EC, but he is capable of so much more).  Maybe he's holding back to keep from overshadowing BB, but I think both of  them could have stood to kick it up a notch in places.<br />        In all I'd  say this CD will make a great intro for blues-curious newbies drawn by  Clapton's name, and will certainly give BB more exposure... always a good  thing. And there is still much to recommend it for long-time blues fans  too, although I think Eric's fans will be the happiest with it. I give it 3  ***s, good. And wouldn't it be a kick if they released a classic BB tune  like Help The Poor as a single, and got some serious airplay on rock  stations? I'd love to see it blow Britney and M&amp;M right off the charts  (if we ever needed an antidote...), but I guess I'm starting to dream  now...
B00000K19E|5.0|I give this beast a 5 star rating not for a totally engrossing, semi-believable, emotional story, or great acting, or even great concept. I rate this monster special FX film a 5 because of such great directoral  features. These two brothers were able to come up with some of the coolest,  hardest, most intense action scenes ever in a movie. I watch this on DVD  everyday and just gape time and time again at the beauty of the  &quot;Pillar Scene.&quot; Some of the shots and moves are so unique that  one has to wonder how two people could cooperate enough to come up with  this. If you like neato action and beautiful women in leather, this is  definitely your movie. If you want a deep storyline (and believe me, it's  not as deep as one might think. anyone could get drunk and think something  like this up. just check out 13th floor...) than go elsewhere, but give  this masterpiece of movie making techniques a chance first!
0671867369|4.0|Historian Stephen Ambrose, shortly before writing his book on the D-Day invasion (&quot;D-Day: June 6th, 1944&quot;) took the time to write &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, the story of the men of E Company, 506th  Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. The soldiers who fought in this unit saw  nearly the entire war in Europe- the Normandy invasion, to the ferocious  fighting of Operation Market-Garden (the Allies risky strike into Holland),  to the Battle of the Bulge, to the collapse of the German Army in April of  1945.<br />Fans of military history will find Ambrose's book illuminating. The  unit had its tensions with foolish officers and its experiences in the war  were pretty rough. Many didn't return from the crusade for freedom in  Europe. Read &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; and remember those who gave their  lives.
6305399212|5.0|This movie is the epitomy of so many different talented people in Hollywood and could also be credited with fueling many different actor, actress, and director's careers. The special edition of the film adds a 17  minute segment tying the overruning of Hadley's Hope colony up to the alien  derelict. Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn complement each other  perfectly as Lt. Ripley and Cpl. Hicks respectively. You truly get a sense  of the colonial marines being believeable people in their emotions and  actions to their squad mates during dangerous situations regarding the  aliens and a traitor. Excellent direction from James Cameron tops the movie  off and leaves you constantly watching and begging for more. Superb film  for all viewers.
B00002NDB1|4.0|Maiden is known for its meodies, solos and lyrics.  This album is no exception.  Bruce fanatics dismiss it, but new guy Blaze Bayley does a fine job.  The CD features many fine songs like &quot;Futureal&quot;,  &quot;Educated Fool&quot; and &quot;The Clansman&quot;.  All I can say is  this, If you like Maiden you will like this album.  It is squarely in the  middle of their catalouge, more uplifting than the X-Factor, but  not as  good.  Similar to &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; in both vibe and overall  sound. Cheers, UP THE IRONS!

B00003W8NM|4.0|Judging from the majority of reviews posted on this site, 'Fight Club' is a wickedly subversive piece of art that deserves to be canonized. According to their ridiculously linear perspective, it represents a cinematic blueprint that both established and emerging directors should aspire to.  Ahh, the sheer depth and plethora of Fincher's thematic exploration, the  philosophical implications of the script, the erudite dialogue that  provides the viewer with relevant insights into the nature of the operation  of modern day society and the psychological effects it has on the average  individual. However, if I'm rendered completely unable to dish out sarcasm  at an exponential rate by some mysterious twist of fate, the true nature of  this film will be revealed when said tendency ceases to exist. 'F.C' is  essentially a diluted collection of academic notions that have been around  for quite an extensive period of time. Marx who?   ...Okay, many films have been dealing with  significant themes such as modern day alienation, emotional 'vapidness' as  a consequence of unregulated capitalism, the on going search for identity  and purpose in life etc but `Fight Club' only SUPERFICIALLY deals with  these profoundly significant issues. Instead of focussing on a couple and  proceeding to `flesh to them out', Fincher and co unwisely decided to  baffle the average viewer by throwing heaps of ideas at them in the hope  the subject/s will leave the cinema pondering a few. The result is an  interesting, moderately audacious film that is challenging to a certain  extent, by virtue of its deceptively complex, not to mention slightly  incoherent, finale. Now while many of you ...  will no doubt  feel compelled to reach the conclusion that I `missed the point' or `didn't  get it', to you I present the following challenge: ... [can] you explain to me  how EVERY scene between Tyler and Norton supports the film's ending or is  simply a characterization device...?   Unless you possess a  method of elucidation that will forever remain elusive to the large  proportion of us simple folk, your arguments will be easy to undermine. The  movie is designed to perplex the viewer and many of the scenes leading up  to the big twist aren't necessary and therefore add reinforcement to my  opinion that the film's vision is skewed. You could argue `but they are  entertaining'. Sure but if this is the case, please don't try and pass this  film off as being an example of `profoundly intelligent film making'. For  the purpose of `clarifying' my intentions of this review, this is directed  at those who either take this movie relatively seriously or alternatively,  believe it's a cutting edge social satire. Recommendations: Social satire  with depth(BRAZIL), pertinent analysis of the modern human condition and  the search for a happier mode of existence (THE IDIOTS).  <br />Post scriptum:  'F.C' is a great film IMO.  However, most of the other reviewers have  already pointed out its merits so it would be redundant of me to add more  of the same.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I thought that this cd was just awesome. I heard the song &quot;Higher&quot; on the radio and thought it was amazing. Some of my friends also said that Creed was a Christian rock/alternitive group. So  with that I just had to get the cd.  With lyrics like &quot;Can you take me  higher to the place with golden streets&quot; are just awesome for a  rock/alternitive group.
B000000WZ4|5.0|The logical evolution of the most cutting edge musical group on earth..Depeche Mode's &quot;Ultra&quot; is as close to perfection as is possible.  A must for the collection of anyone serious about their  euro/techno musical tastes.<br />s_dennis@hotmail.com
B0000089N1|5.0|This is an excellent album, very dark (see Darkest Days, Drugstore, Drowning, and Waking Up Beside You). You can see some influence of The Cure in Waking Up Beside You. The singles are great, especially Sometimes It  Hurts (why didn't they do a remix of this song?) and Hopeless is an awesome  b-side, one of my fave SW songs. There is a remix of &quot;Waking Up Beside  You&quot; on the Crow 3 soundtrack that's really cool, you might wanna  check that out. If you really like Stabbing Westward, you might wanna go on  a manhunt for the Save Yourself single from Australia that has remixes of  Save Yourself, The Thing I Hate, and On Your Way Down, or some other cool  rarities, like the Jap. version of this CD or the Jap. version of WBB+P.
B000002UTH|5.0|This albun is really funky.  You can really see George Clinton's influence.  It's quite different than the chili's current music, but all their music is excellent.  This albums shows off Flea's superb skills on  the trumpet.  Overall, this is a really fun and funky album.  My favorite  songs sre &quot;American Ghost Dance&quot;, &quot;If you want me to  stay&quot;, and &quot;Yertle the Turtle.&quot;  I would reccomend it to  anyone.
630587493X|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen in years. Robin Williams does a remarkable job adding human characters and feelings to the mechanical man. Slowly, trying to evolve into a human being, wanting all the feelings  and willing to except all the frailties. Make's one thankful for life and  appreciative of the wonderful things we take for granted every day. Our  families, friends, senses, feelings, the list is endless. <br />Obviously, you  can tell I really enjoyed this film. I am actually shocked I haven't heard  anything about. No rave reviews or even negative. Maybe I just missed them  all.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Man! what is up with that one guy? Limp Bizkit is not all that bad. He,or She, said that it expresses testosterone and wanting to hurt people. Thats the reason I have this CD! I like songs that express a harsh attitude. Break Stuff, and Re-Arranged are my favorite songs, but mostly Break Stuff  is. That song expresses how he feels, and thats what music is suppost to  do, express how you feel. And in the song he is explaining how ( ) off  he is! Re-Arranged is a song about him breaking up with his girl and what  is happening between them. Its not a bad song. So if you ask me, I would  buy it. I think it's worth it.
B000007T1M|5.0|This album and Slipknot's debut are two of the best hard albums I've heard in a long time.  The beats are original, not the same beats being recycled over each track (see Korn if you like that stuff).  The lead singer has a  great personality too, he injects a lot of energy into this album.  Tracks  worth checking out: Darts, Suggestions, Peephole (my fav, kind of like an  updated metal version of the Doors's Alabama Song), Mind, Sugar, Suite-Pee,  and War.  Any one of those released as a single would have become a hit.
B000002KHH|5.0|THERE WAS NO BAND BACK IN 1970 THAT WAS PLAYING MUSIC QUITE LIKE THIS.AND I CAN`T THINK OF A BAND THAT HAS INFLUENCED MORE BANDS THAN BLACK SABBATH.THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST AND ONE OF THE FIRST TRUE METAL  CD`S.OZZIE`S VOICE IS JUST GREAT ON THIS.GREAT SONGS WAR PIGS AND OF COURSE  PARANOID.BUT THIS CD IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE THROW AWAY SONG PLANET  CARAVAN.THIS IS THE CD THAT REALLY BROKE BLACK SABBATH IN THE US.IT WILL  ALWAYS BE ONE OF MY FAVORITES.I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS CD.
B000002G6J|5.0|This album will always hold a special place in my heart as it accompanied me to college in the early 1970s.  I would play it in the listening room with headphones on--over and over, again.  Little did I realize back then  how important or significant Brazilian music would become in my  life.<br />This album is one of Claus Ogerman's arranging BEST, by far.  Each  track is a jewel; my favorites being &quot;Look to the Sky&quot; and  &quot;Antigua&quot;.  Having it on CD is a godsend after these years of  hearing it with surface noise.  Jobim's piano playing is masterful and just  the way I like piano played--mostly single notes with a light, delicate  touch.  Though it's an overused cliche, this album IS a classic and belongs  in every jazz or Brazilian music lover's collection.<br />Incidentally, the  credits for the drums/percussion listing on the album are incorrect and  have never been amended, even for the CD versions (import or U.S.).  Claudio Slon is the sole drummer on the entire album and Romao/Rosengarden  are percussionists only.  This was confirmed for me by Claudio Slon himself  when I began work on his discography.
B000002KIK|4.0|I wish this album's title could have meant the future of the original lineup.  I wish that lineup didn't have to say die, but even though Osbourne parted ways, Sabbath still put out some good records.  In my opinion, this album was much better than Technical Ecstasy.  Some of the  songs were definitely an experimentation, as far as the quiet &quot;Air  Dance&quot; and jazzy &quot;Breakout.&quot;  Other than that, there are  some straight-up crunchy metal bruisers like:  the title track,  &quot;Johnny Blade,&quot; &quot;Over to You,&quot; and  &quot;Shockwave.&quot;  Sadly this was the last studio effort of the  original lineup, but it was pretty good!
B00004TH83|5.0|lara fabians new cd is the best music i have ever heard. I think it is better than celion dion. I recomend this cd for everyone including children.
B000002J1F|5.0|Strange that this is called »Fragile« - 'cause in my ears, this brilliant Yes album has a kind of relaxed touch to it.<br />It contains four longer songs - »Roundabout«, »South Side Of The Sky«, »Long Distance Runaround«  and »Heart Of The Sunrise« - that are all among the absolute top acts of  Yes. Furthermore, these are all good introductions if you want to introduce  Yes to somebody, and you don't want to start out too \\"hard\\"!<br />The other  tracks are solos - one for each band member - and these are not only  interesting, they are also very worthwhile little tunes!<br />In other words:  »Fragile« is a must-have album! Not just for any Yes admirer but for  everyone who's interested in music.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughn was in my oppinion the greatest most inspirational guitarist that has ever lived. This man could interject mor feeling with one note than other guitarist could do with whole songs. This man is one of  a kind, and I am appaled at all the up and comming guitarists who are even  being compaired to him. Stevie played from a place so deep within himself I  think most of us don't even know that place exists. Stevie was truely an  amazing guitarist and he will live on in the souls of all the people that  he has touched with his music. Fly on Stevie...
B00000I9P1|4.0|Survivor was one of the best 1980s rock bands! Unfortunately, it's most known for its songs from soundtracks to the Rocky movies, Eye Of The Tiger and Burning Heart. The band has made even better stuff though, and  When Seconds Count is its best - and most underrated - album!
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughn is one of the most influencial guitarist ever. His renditions of how guitar playing is suppoesed to be has shaped so many young minds to what real blues sounds like.

6304411448|4.0|A tale for heart and mind<br />»Benny &amp; Joon« is a movie about a car mechanic who lives with his mentally ill sister. Well, she's not THAT ill - but ill enough that Benny has to take care of her, and this even at the  cost of not developing a life on his own.<br />One day, a weirdo - played  brilliantly by annoyingly good-looking Johnny Depp - comes to town. This is  the start of changes in the life of Joon. And of Benny.<br />This unusual  movie has all a good movie needs. It is an interesting, moving and also  entertaining story, told in a heartfelt way without being too sentimental.  And fortunately it lacks the major drawbacks of Hollywood movie clichés!

B00004S96B|4.0|I wonder why some people categorize Queensrÿche under progressive rock. To me, this is just rock. But great rock, rock of a high caliber! And this album »Empire« is the best Queensrÿche ever came up with!<br />On vinyl, this  is a double album even though there are only 11 tracks. But they're all  pretty long, and the filmic sound effects introducing and extroducing every  song must've provided inspiration for bands like Therapy? and Zyrk.<br />The  highlights are »Jet City Woman« and the ballads »Anybody Listening?« and  »Silent Lucidity«. And, oh, by the way, this album title was taken as a  title for a German prog rock magazine too... because of the greatness of the  album... which is not prog rock but pure ROCK.
B00004THAY|5.0|I've been a BB fan for many years and only recently discovered how much I like EC (see my Unplugged review).  I have been waiting for this album to come out since reading about it a few weeks ago, and it was well worth the  wait.  The vintage picture of EC and BB together and the passionate version  of Come Rain or Come Shine are worth the price of the CD.  All the tracks  are rich, wonderful, exquisite.  It is music that will rock you, soothe you  and give you great listening pleasure for a long time to come.
B00003CXDU|4.0|Sci-fi fans will obviously love this movie, which twits all the conventions of Star Trek and its ilk. For the rest of us, it's a pretty good exploration of what actors might owe, both to their audiences and the  characters they play.<br />The shtick of this movie is that former actor Jason  Nesmith (Tim Allen) and the rest of the cast of the fictional sci-fi show  &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; are mistaken for an actual starship crew by  extraterrestrials. But the slight plot fades in importance to seeing Allen,  Sigourney Weaver shift from playing actors to playing their  characters.<br />It's worth watching, and could be enjoyably paired up with  &quot;Wes Craven's New Nightmare&quot; for another take on the same theme.  Enjoy!
6304806426|5.0|First things first: this is not the novel. A novel doesn't really have to have a story. Certainly the &quot;English Patient,&quot; as a novel does not. For the purposes of the movie, Minghella introduces interesting  wrinkles which allow the filming of a movie out of a novel lacking in the  essentials of moviemaking. This, in itself, ie wonderous. but then throw in  the three principle actors in this movie, all of whom turn in remarkable  performances and you have a movie of stunning beauty.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is fantastic!  And I'm not a big fan of rap. Thisalbum is funny and fabulous!  The lyrical content is deep and the beats are outstanding. This kid is talented and deserves to be ranked with such  predicessors as Tupac and Ice Cube and that is no small feat. This kid  thinks of the most insane things and manages to make it not only humorous  but it takes you to a level that you should be repulsed but your laughing  your ass off!  So I do recommend to anyone to buy this cd it was the best  $ you'll ever spend.
B000002J1C|5.0|This is the first really REALLY great Yes album. Consisting only of pure masterpieces. The merciless opener »Yours Is No Disgrace« will hammer itself into anybody's ears. The epic »I've Seen All Good People« will catch  you immediately with its notable lyrics and exclusive instrumentation and  musicianship. And the masterpiece closing song »Perpetual Change« will keep  you awake until you have listened to it again (and then again).<br />Plus the  legendary »Starship Trooper« which needn't be mentioned since it's one of  Yes's most played songs ever.<br />What more is there to say!  »The Yes Album«  is an absolute classic. A must-have. Be careful though: If you can get hand  on the vinyl album, buy that one. The CD is not exactly perfect in its  sound!
B00000JCOV|4.0|I remember buying this self/titled debut LP from the 'knotters' before many aussies had heard of them. I traveled from place to place trying to find it, eventually settling on an unsetteling price and made my way home with my new purchase....<br />I was totally blown away the first time i listened to it,  from the opening grinder (sic) to the closing stages of the secret song (i  don't know the name) it kept my ears glued to the stereo. Althought this  album kept me listening for a few weeks! i grew tired of them only to be  hooked again. If you love bands such as Static-X, Coal Chamber and NOT LIMP  BIZKIT, then this is for you.
B000002J1X|4.0|The second Yes album »Time And A Word« takes off where its predecessor »Yes« landed. Its root is jazz but the rock element is growing, and to a large extend it outrules the jazz on this album.<br />The only remaining jazz  song is »Then« which, just like the opener »No Opportunity Necessary, No  Experience Needed«, has the first touches of the progressive style that  became the trademark of Yes later on. A song like »Sweet Dreams« is much  more straight forward.<br />The title track remains a Yes classic to this  day.<br />Certainly an interesting album on the edge between jazz and rock,  preparing for the leap into prog.
0060930187|4.0|The overall theme of this book was human suffering. The author explored themes related to this, such as the human mind, struggle, suicide, and young women's positions in society during the 1940s and 50s: more  specifically, how this society refuses to take women's aspirations  seriously.  However, the general theme and certainly the best explored idea  of this book would be human suffering and madness. The author explores this  well, probably because this was an autobiography. Sylvia Plath obviously  understands at the deepest level the theme of this novel; it being a theme  in her own life. First Plath explores how suffering begins and develops in  a person. In this book, it is not actually clear what brought on the main  character's terrifying internal battles and descent into madness. But the  development is portrayed clearly; the stages of self doubt turning constant  feelings of having no worth whatsoever.  The character (as Plath calls  herself, Esther) accuses herself of being useless in a society that has no  place for her. And so begins a spiraling, quick decline in this young woman  as she descends into a life of self mutilation. Throughout this novel,  Esther contemplates suicide frequently: \\"But when it came right down to it,  the skin of my wrists looked so white and defenseless against the blade of  my Gillete that I just couldn't do it.\\" However, after following multiple  attempts at suicide, Esther finally manages to overdose on enough sleeping  pills as to land herself in the hospital. Shortly after she is sent to a  Psychiatric Ward, where it is expected Electroshock Treatments will cure  her depression. After endless, blurry days full of pain and misery, her  condition improves. Esther is released from the Ward and is almost herself  again.  Around this time in her life, Plath completed the book The Bell Jar  and produced a plethora of poetry, all astounding pieces of work. By this  time she was married to a poet, Ted Hughes, and had two children.Although  she was said to be hopeful and optimistic during these days of her life, on  the morning of February 11, 1963, Plath ended her life without explanation.  This book conveys a journey of an individual's personal experience with  human suffering. The theme is well explored by the author, to the extent  where the novel was criticized for being hitting the reader with such  disturbing impact. I, as well, found this novel to be disturbing. Sylvia  Plath dug deep into the landscape of the human mind and eloquently  portrayed darkness, disillusion, and despair.
6304675348|4.0|Well, it's not »Scream« but it comes close. This new combination of teenage entertainment and tomato ketchup horror is a worthwhile genre. Gorgeous chicks, cool blokes, stupid policemen, and journalists without any  sense of reality and humanity. All in all: the turn of the  century...<br />Definitely entertaining. Definitely worth the money.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is the greatest film ever made.  It displays the best use of  the cinematic medium thus far.<br />Eraserhead manages to move that which  exists only on the inside directly into a form that we can all experience.   David Lynch managed to achieve this incredible, super-human feat only once.   And only once has it been achieved in the whole of cinema history.   Watching this film gives you the overwhelming feeling that you are  witnessing one of man's greatest artistic achievements.  And that's exactly  what this is - one of the greatest human creations of all time.<br />This is  not a throw-away film.  You must watch it in the dark, at night, with the  lights off, on your own and with no distractions whatsoever.  Only then  will you be able to give the film the attention it demands of you.
B00003CXDU|3.0|Tip one: never, ever go to a PG-rated film at 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon. I got spoiled by having empty theaters for the last few movies I went to. I haven't seen a theatre this full since Sleepy Hollow. At least the subject  matter was more appropriate this time.<br /><br />Despite the presence of some  serious starpower, this had the potential to be a truly awful movie.  Thankfully, it managed to avoid that, although it took the easy way out.  The cast of an old TV show called Galaxy Quest are making their living  showing up at conventions. (Sound familiar?) They are approached by a band  of real aliens, who think that the reruns are actually documentaries, who  ask them to save their planet from the evil lizard-bird-alien-thing Saris.  The commander (Tim Allen), who thinks they're asking him to do a faked  appearance, goes along and discovers himself actually out in space, in a  real replica of the Galaxy Quest ship. He lures the others (including an  extra who was killed five minutes into his episode-- sound familiar?) into  helping him battle Saris. With, of course, the expected results.<br /><br />This  could have also degenerated into simple parody. And it's good enough simple  parody of the first few crossover Star Trek films (while Tim Allen's  character is obviously modeled on Jim Kirk, Alan Rickman seems to be an odd  cross of Spock and Picard-- early on, he mumbles to himself, &quot;Why am I  doing this? I played Richard III!&quot;), with more than enough laughs to  stand, but what turns this puerile silliness into truly biting satire is  the second level of parody; if you see Star Trek itself as a self-parody,  something that was meant to be cheesy, then you can see a lot of Galaxy  Quest as parody within parody. The miners (you've seen the trailers, right?  The ones Sigourney Weaver says &quot;look like little children&quot;) bear  a more-than-passing resemblance to Teletubbies, carrying on the Star Trek  tradition of pop-culture cannibalism; jokes are made about Tim Allen's  character sleeping with everything that moves; etc.<br /><br />All is well and  good with the last hour of this film. It's funny, smart (well, okay, in a  stupid way), well-acted, and cheesy as all get-out. It's the first twenty  minutes that I couldn't get my head around. The slowest of slow starts,  which usually spells death for a comedy; the strength of the movie's  remaining time is all that saves it. The cast are capable. The script is  stupid, but it's supposed to be (and intent is everything). Sigourney  Weaver still looks fabulous with half her clothing ripped off.<br /><br />The  tagline is &quot;never give up; never surrender.&quot; I wish they'd  circumvented it long enough to give up the first twenty minutes of this  movie. ** 1/2re made about Tim Allen's  character sleeping with everything that moves; etc. <br /><br />All is well and  good with the last hour of this film.

B00003CXDV|5.0|Greetings... I am Primaat... I am from... France... I found great earth humor in this series of still images placed on a very good tasting acetate media... Very clever these Tarans, to make a media that is both  enter-taining and delicious, when consumed with fried chicken embryos, and  the beverage made of hopps.  Upon viewing, my cone realed in waves  of...delight... Not since seeing Yaknoo the Humorous on the third planet of  the Neepzor System ... (I mean ...Paris, in ..France) has my cone been so  filled with mirth.  I recommend this highly to earthlings and others  wishing to be entertained and nourished at the same... time... Earthilings  in space! hahahahaha In Summation, I, Primaat rate this both 5 stars plus  for it's entertainment value, and the taste of it's acetate media.
6303039456|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this somewhat fact-based tale of the formation and exploits of the first Jamacian bobsled team, but it ended up being quite charming for all that, despite the presence of the  normally-annoying John Candy. A very nice way to expend no braincells for  an hour and a half and laugh quite a bit in the process. The script is a  little obvious at times as Malik Yoba (in his first role-- he's going  places, trust me on this) falls into the hate-love role with one of his  teammates and John Candy gives inspirational speeches, but this isn't the  kind of film that you rent expecting a really good script. Go in expecting  nothing and you'll get a very pleasant surprise.
0060977493|5.0|An amazing book with a totally unique style that makes you want to re-read it over again. It takes a look at the deep engrained caste system in India that affects the lives of an already disfunctional family and results in  the destruction of all hopes and dreams for the characters involved. The  general theme of 'who shall be loved and how much' is twisted into a family  drama that changes everyones' lives.  The author very cleverly gives you  glimpses of the past and future with some intriguing foreshadowing, weaving  the story together and enticing the reader to the final dramatic climax. I  encourage people to read this book even though the names and culture may  seem so foreign to begin with - it is definately worth it!
6302968100|2.0|Tarantino writes the script. And everyone and their mothers are in this movie. The casting must have cost half the budget. (One wonders why Steve Buscemi wasn't in on this one.) However, the casting and the script are pretty much the only reasons to  watch this movie, which is about forty-five minutes too long for its plot.  Christian Slater and his unknowing wife (Patricia Arquette) steal half a  million dollars' worth of cocaine from a very nasty pimp/dealer (an  unrecognizable Gary Oldman, playing as great a bad guy as he did in The  Professional) and head for Cali to sell it. Could've been a high-powered  action flick (the theft), could have been a good road movie (getting to  Cali), could have been another good high-powered action flick (trying to  sell the drugs to a hysterically funny Bronson Pinchot), but when the  director attempted to glue the pieces together, everything came out flat.  For Tarantino completists.

6305538018|4.0|Another slice of unreality from Cronenberg that drops you into another odd existence from which you have to figure out the rules. It's got the usual Cronenberg trademarks we know and love (weird organic creations, odd  surgical instruments, extreme feminist symbolism dealing with gaping holes  in men's bodies into which women stick things, organic guns, etc.), a  higher level of starpower than most Cronenberg flicks, and mutant Chinese  food. How can you go wrong? People either love Cronenberg or they hate him.  I fall completely on the love side and have ever since I first saw Scanners  all those years ago. The only thing missing here? The everpresent Stephen  Lack. Whither, David? Bring him back!
0767903854|5.0|This book is certainly one of Bryson's better travelogues.  But, then again, he had a wonderful country to discuss.  I am a huge fan of Bryson and Paul Theroux, the latter tending more toward the sarcastic observation.   <br />However, I am genuinely puzzled as to how he could simply forget  Tasmania!  I still have a few chapters to go, but I have scanned through  them and nothing, no mention of this gorgeous island hanging off the bottom  of Australia.  Quite a large oversight for someone who is writing a book  about the whole of Australia.
6304618344|3.0|First: what kind of weird coincidence causes me to suddenly rent two films containing tracks by Tricky, when I didn't know either did? Weird, that. (and &quot;Christian Sands&quot; is one of my faves, too...)<br /><br />Another  movie I'm split on, but in this case I know why: while Nicholas Cage shone  in this film in a way I've never seen before, John Travolta couldn't hold  up his end of it at all.<br /><br />Cage was brilliant. Best I've ever seen him  do. Bounces from complete fanatic to distraught cop with no problems at  all, and plays both roles so convincingly you can actually believe they  could suck a face off person A and deposit it on person B. On the other  hand, Cage walked into Travolta's role halfway through this film, with  Travolta having set him up badly. And that was the role Travolta played  _well_. I don't know why he was so off here, but he just wasn't up to  snuff, especially after the switch. He just didn't work as a psycho (odd,  considering he worked so well as an antisocial murderer in Pulp Fiction).  Go figger.<br /><br />So ultimately, the movie has to stand or fall on the  ensemble cast, since Travolta's given it two strikes. And it stands.  Alessandro Nivola, especially, is wonderful as Nicholas Cage's brainy,  sociopathic brother, and Nick Cassavetes makes a fine, fine bad guy. Add in  the patented John Woo action sequences, and this becomes a couple of hours  of good escapist fluff, if you can get past John Travolta as Mr. Wooden  Personality.
B00004THAY|5.0|I have been a Clapton fan for a long time and have come to love the blues because of him.  This CD has got to be a classic and will surely produce some awards for the two of them. You get the feeling they are just sitting  around playing and having a great time together.  If this was a lifelong  dream of the two, it's a shame they waited so long to fulfill it.   I loved  &quot;Worried life Blues&quot;, &quot;Riding with the King&quot; and of  course &quot;Hold on, I'm comin&quot; not to mention everything else on the  CD.  This one will go to work with me.  If you like Eric Clapton or BB King  you will want this in your collection.
B00003CX7L|4.0|Any film that starts with an award-winning animated short can't be all bad, especially when you realize that that animated short (Pixar's first film) was created in 1986, and must have cost them a small fortune. Whoever  was behind those two lamps was a demented genius. Whoever thought a lamp  could show emotion so clearly? More clearly than many actors, I'd warrant.<br /><br />That aside, the movie itself was pretty durned good. We were the only  people in the theater right up until the beginning of the movie, when a  troupe of aboust seven kids and their beleaguered parents wandered in. They  were as well-behaved as could be expected, thankfully. Tangent: there was  also an extended (five minute) preview for a film coming out in May called  Dinosaur. The animation, at least what we saw, is nothing short of  spectacular. Looks like a good'un.<br /><br />How can you do a review of Toy  Story 2 without comparing it to the original? Simple-- you can't. And there  were a few places it suffered in comparison, though few they were. While  the original was pretty much lighthearted all the way through, there was  one early scene in this movie (the trashcan scene, for those of you who've  already seen it) that, were I the target age of this movie, would have  given me nightmares for weeks. And the motivations of the chicken man  (voice of Wayne Knight) were probably a lot darker and more complex than  kids will be able to grasp.<br /><br />That being said, the main focus of the  movie is, and should be, on Wayne Knight, the evil collector guy. Being the  ex-husband of a collector, I've observed the pathology at close range for  an extended period of time, and whoever wrote this part and coached Knight  did a superb job. This is about as good a portrayal of the collector as  I've ever seen. And no, there isn't a bit of exaggeration there. The story  is simple enough: Knight, who runs a toy store, sees Woody at a yard sale,  attempts to buy him for an astounding price, and then steals him to  complete a collection of Round-Up Woody memorabilia (it seems Woody was the  star of a really, really awful 50s TV show) to sell to a Japanese museum  for a horrendous sum of money. The other toys try to get him back, meeting  a whole bunch of weird, unscrupulous, and downright silly characters in the  process. We finally meet Zurg, Buzz Lightyear's arch-nemesis; the old guy  from &quot;The Chess Game&quot; makes a cameo (and now we know what he does  for a living); and the little green guys from the crane game in the  original movie pop back up and are as funny as ever.<br /><br />The graphics and  animation are top-notch, which we've come to expect in a flick that will  keep the kids entertained and provides more than enough plot to keep the  adults going, too. Worthwhile on all counts.d then steals him to  complete a collection of Round-Up Woody memorabilia (it seems Woody was the  star of a really, really awful 50s TV show) to sell to a Japanese museum  for a horrendous sum of money.

6305905401|4.0|As Polanski has become increasingly reclusive and eccentric, I've often wondered exactly what goes through his head when he decides to film something. I've been wondering it more and more over the last two decades or so, as what little output Polanski has released has become increasingly  humorless, bitter, and savage, culminating in the brilliantly unstable  Death and the Maiden in 1994. Something seems to have happened in the past  six years, however. Polanski has given us his finest, and funniest, film  since The Fealress Vampire Killers-- and for much the same reasons.<br /><br />There is a subgenre of film, mostly horror film (but a good number of  what can only be termed &quot;men's adventure&quot; flicks also fall into  this category), that can best be described as &quot;fuzzy.&quot; Everything  about them is fuzzy. The focus is just a tad off. The soundtrack sounds as  if it has been recorded through a wad of cotton. The color is a little off.  You know the genre. Karen Black is probably its most enduring star, and  Dario Argento has directed about eight hundred fuzzy flicks. Many people  see fuzzy and translate to low-quality, thus dismissing a whole subgenre of  often brilliant filmmaking-- Argento, Lucio Fulci, Carpenter's early work,  Wes Craven, early David Lynch, etc. But we often forget where the original  fuzzy came from. Coppola and Corman got together for the classic Dementia  13 (1963), right in the middle of Polanski's trilogy of distressing imagery  (Knife in the Water, The Beautiful Swindlers, and Repulsion). It is  probably from these four films, and their styles of production and  direction, that this whole subgenre came about, and its first true champion  recognized by a wider audience was yet another Polanski all-star  extravaganza, Rosemary's Baby (1968).<br /><br />In The Ninth Gate, Polanski,  who has a lot more money now, has given us the epitome of what makes fuzzy  filmmaking great, but he's ramped up the budget, attracted fantastic  starpower and the highest quality of production, and essentially made a  great seventies satan-worshipper film (remember Ernest Borgnine in The  Devil's Rain? Heh...) in the new century. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a  rare book mercenary of sorts, hired by the shifty-eyed Boris Balkan (Frank  Langella) to track down the two other remaining copies of a book Balkan now  owns. Balkan is convinced that, of these three books, one is an authentic  copy and two are forgeries, and Corso's job is to discover which is the  actual tome in question (and, one can assume from Balkan's persona, to  switch the fake with the authentic one, assuming Balkan has a fake).<br /><br />The truth, of course, is nowhere near as simple as this, and as Corso  goes on his journey, attended by the breathtakingly beautiful nameless  stranger (Polanski's present spouse, Emmanuelle Seigner) and a few people  seemingly less concerned with Corso's welfare (Lena Olin, as the widow of  the original owner of Balkan's copy of the book in question, and her  bodyguard/hired hand/whatever, an unnamed character played by a chap I've  never seen before).<br /><br />The Ninth Gate also falls into another subgenre  of film, and it doesn't have a name, but when you see the film, it  immediately bears comparison to others of its type-- films that there are  two kinds of viewers for, those who will willingly suspend all possible  belief and enjoy the hell out of it, and those who just won't get it. The  film that springs immediately to mind, of course, is The Blair Witch  Project, but that's only because of recency; Cronenberg's masterpiece of  twisted illusion, Videodrome, is a much better comparison when all is said  and done. Similarly to Videodrome, the viewer is always given the sensation  that something is a little off, and that perhaps the real action is always  going on somewhere just off camera; Depp is embroiled in the same kind of  seemingly-predestined confusion as Woods (and it helps that both havethis  odd woman following them around and showing up in the oddest places-- in  Woods' case, Debbie Harry was the vixen in question). If you thought  Videodrome was a fantastic piece of work, and that James Woods turned in  the performance of his career, you'll probably walk out of The Ninth Gate  feeling exactly the same way I did about it--&quot;wow.&quot;<br /><br />There's  been a lot made, in the press, of the pace of the movie. &quot;Johnny Depp  runs around Europe looking for old books.&quot; Sure. If you go into a  Roman Polanski flick expecting something that could have been cut from the  same cloth as the Friday the Thirteenth movies, you're bound to be  disappointed. Polanski is a master of the atmospheric horror film, where  the horror is more suggested than splattered, as Rosemary's Baby,  Repulsion, and Death and the Maiden are tribute to. Nothing less should be  expected from The Ninth Gate, and Polanski delivers on all counts. This  isn't a scary film so much as it is a disturbing one, suspenseful at times  (only one car chase, thankfully!), and laugh-out-loud funny at others.<br /><br />Special consideration, come this time next year, should probably be  given to sound and sound effects editing (the ambient soundtrack to the  film is one of the better ones of recent years-- if The Haunting had had  this music, it would have been almost watchable) and Best Supporting Actor  for a person who usually stays behind the camera, Jose Lopez Rodero, in a  double role as the Brothers Ceniza. He-- they-- are one of the film's many  highlights, despite their small role. Cinematography here is wide and  brilliant, as well; Polanski takes us on a whirlwind trip through some of  Europe's most picturesque spots, including the backstreets of Portugal  (where the Cenizas' shop lies) and a stunning collapsing villa that is the  home of Victor Fargas, one of the other owners of the book in question  (played handily by Jack Taylor, best known for acting in those  aforementioned men's adventure titles in Italy). Depp probably still won't  get his well-deserved Best Actor nomination, and his role doesn't really  warrant it, though the panache and humor he brings to it make it that much  the finer; it wouldn't be too much of a surprise to see Polanski up for  either Director or Adapted Screenplay, however.<br /><br />It's probably not for  everyone....have this  odd woman following them around and showing up in the oddest places-- in  Woods' case, Debbie Harry was the vixen in question).

B00001IVOR|5.0|Even though I've had this album for nearly two years now I can still listen to it over and over again (this is the great strength with Wu albums). If they'd cut out the shit tracks and the filler (wu-revolution,  black shampoo, second coming) this album would come extremely close to  matching enter. As usual the RZA creates amazing aural soundscapes, though  4th Disiple does good as well, and on the tracks they shine on they really  shine, For heavens sake, Older Gods, Triumph, the City and Hellz Wind Staff  in particular. If the next LP is a combination of this and Enter The  Wu-Tang it will destroy nearly every other rap album made. If you've not  got any Wu-Tang Lps get Enter first but otherwise you'll not regret buying  this.
0790729989|5.0|My all-time top 100 changes in minor ways as time goes on, but there are certain films that will never leave it, and Seven is one of them.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />I was told that the movie lost a lot in transition to the small  screen. If this is the case, I'm considering renting the film reels and  arranging a private screening for myself at Cinemark, because this is  simply one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. Yes, we have the  same formula as we had in The Bone Collector and a hundred thousand other  films-- two cops get thrown together on a case neither really wants, and  they don't like one another much. But that's where the formula stops. Brad  Pitt and Morgan Freeman can't stand one another. Brad Pitt's wife, expertly  played by the annoying Gwyneth Paltrow, attempts to smooth the path between  them. And all the while a killer is baiting the two of them with murders,  tortures, and various other brutalities based on the seven deadly sins.<br />  I didn't care that it was cut with commercials every fifteen minutes like  clockwork. I didn't care that many of the more gruesome scenes (which were  described to me in detail where they would have been) were left out. I  didn't care that the overdubs were, in many places, silly. From moment one,  this was simply the most absorbing move I've seen this year, and probably  in the last five years or more. I was completely captivated by Brad Pitt's  obsession with the case, Morgan Freeman's desire but inability to walk away  when the day of his retirement came, the stark camerawork (especially when  the killer reveals himself-- an exceptionally powerful scene in an  exceptionally powerful movie), the excruciating details of the plotting,  many of which had an insanely sick humor to them. I found myself laughing  at this movie a whole lot more than I expected to, another strong point in  its favor.<br />  This goes right up there with Closetland on the All-Time  Top Ten. A thoroughly fantastic, funny, scary, visually stunning film.scary, visually stunning film.

6304297912|1.0|Okay, so after rejecting this one out of hand for years because I hated every band on the soundtrack, I finally decided to give it a try. And afterwards, I not only hate every band on the soundtrack and every song they contributed, I also hate the movie. If  you want to see a really good movie about the horrors of drug use, you'd do  a lot better with the recognized classic in the genre, Drugstore Cowboy.  This is old territory, only worth going over if you find some redeeming  quality in the music.
B00003Q438|5.0|This DVD is an excellent example of the superiority of the DVD format. There is so much information on this DVD, any Abyss fan can become an expert on every aspect, from the making of the movie to the script  rewrites. This James Cameron masterpeice is shown in it's entirety, yet the  theater cut is also included. There is such an incredible amount of  information on this DVD, one is overwhelmed! This is a great gift for  anyone just starting a DVD collection, or looking for a great classic.
B00003CX59|3.0|Okay, I went to see it. I like Johnny Depp. I like Tim Burton. I wanted to finally figure out who Casper Van Dien is. And, though he's uncredited (at least, until the end credits, that I noticed), I love Christopher Walken.  So why was I so underwhelmed with this movie?<br /><br />Point 1: What made the  Blair Witch Project so effective? 1. Lack of musical score. 2. Lack of  musical score. 3. Lack of musical score. Is it me, or is Danny Elfman  starting to repeat himself these days? I could have sworn I'd heard a  number of parts of this soundtrack in other Burton flicks. (Point for the  devil's advocate-- this may be par for the course in Hollywood; if the  previews are anything like the film, you can expect The Green Mile to have  the same soundtrack as The Shawshank Redemption.) Pieces of it are just  plain overblown. Not the whole thing; there are times, as always, when  Elfman's music is creepily effective, but more often than not it gets loud,  melodramatic, and annoying.<br /><br />Point 2: I have a thing against any movie  that requires someone to stand up, pace, and explain the whole thing at the  end. The idea of a good mystery is that enough clues are given you so that  you can figure it out for yourself, if you have the quickness of wit and  aren't being distracted by a theater full of crying children (which I was).  And make no mistake, the clues are there to be found. However, no context  is given them. At the end, when the clues are pieced together so you figure  all this out, the clues are flashed back on the screen. But in every case  save one, you see more in the flashbacks than you did in the actual scenes.  Not good, not good at all.<br /><br />Point 3, and I'll admit this is a personal  preference: Christina Ricci doesn't sound right with an affected  new-world-British accent. Period.<br /><br />Point 4, and it's even more  naggy-stupid-personal: they found the single ugliest child in the human  race to play Ichabod as a kid. Holy cow. He's out of one of those  nineteenth-century portraits where the kids' heads are five times too large  for their bodies and no one ever smiles. Now we know why-- they all had  teeth that look like his. Ugh.<br /><br />Sure, there's good stuff to be said.  Walken, Walken, Walken, Johnny Depp, a fine cameo by Christopher Lee (with  two minutes of screen time, one wonders why he's in the opening credits),  Van Dien, and for that matter most of the villagers; the gore factor is  done with an eye to humor, and many of the film's laughs come at its  bloodiest moments; Burton's sense of the fantastic and silly is as  perfectly-honed as always. I just wish it had come off as a better mystery.out of one of those  nineteenth-century portraits where the kids' heads are five times too large  for their bodies and no one ever smiles.

B000002UUX|5.0|AWESOME. Yes this album is awesome. This is when MEGADETH got on the way to the top (they reached the top at YOUTHANSIA). Every song here is brilliantly composed and performed. The production is perfect so the sound  is very clear. The albums explodes with 'Holy wars....' which has one of  the best intros I've ever heard and contains mega-lyrics (just like all  MEAGDETH's songs). Then continuing the massacare, is 'Hanger 18'. With its  twisted riff and superb solo, it stands as one of the best thrash songs of  all time and one MEGADETH's best ever. A masterpiece. Then there's the  titanic 'Take no prisoners' and the medivial dusty 'Five magics'. But the  best is yet to come. 'TORNADO OF SOULS' sweeps by and knocks you out. This  is MEGADETH's finest hour here. Check out the solo and you'll be blown  away. Friedman delivers perfectly and the melody and precision in this solo  are....GREAT! God this is what MEGADETH is all about. Raw Thrash at its  finest. In my opinion along with others, this is the ultimate thrash album  so DO NOT HESITATE..GET IT NOW. You won't be disappointed. 'BLOW ME  AWAY....'<br />Thank you.
6305807043|4.0|I don't think I've ever seen a film get so MPD a reaction from those in the theater. Not that some loved it and some hated it... but the same person would come out with both reactions in the space of a sentence. That's phenomenal power, people. That's what filmmaking at its best is all  about-- the ability to elucidate and confuse at the same time. And the best  part, the true knock on Hollywood? That an indie film company stocked  with rock and roll stars made this sucker on a shoestring with the kinds of  starpower normally reserved for Hollywood's biggest nine-figure  blockbusters and it's still been one of the nation's top ten films every  week since the listening public discovered it. I know people who've seen  this as many times as they've seen Rocky Horror. I figured it was time.  (And I had free passes and couldn't use them to see Toy Story 2.)<br /><br />It's hard to say word one about this movie without giving away major  pleasant surprises. Everyone knows, of course, that Malkovich plays himself  (and hams it up tremedously), and most people are aware that the male lead  is John Cusack. The rest of the film's cast is a mystery, I think. It was  to me, anyway. And when they popped the name of the female lead up on the  screen, not only had I not recognized her throughout the movie, but I tried  to figure out who she played... and I got it wrong. Wow. Suffice to say the  casting is stellar, you know almost everyone, and they had to have worked  for scale. And they're all brilliant.<br /><br />One extra little sidelight--  the puppeteering in this movie is tremendous. If you go in for avant-garde  productions and all that sort of stuff, the incredible complexity of the  marionette shows at various times during this film will astound you. The  puppeteer's name was flashed at the end, but I missed it. Remember this  guy, if and when you see this movie, 'cause if anyone ever makes it big in  marionettes, it'll be him.<br /><br />The plot is, um, simple-- an out-of-work  puppeteer (Cusack) gets a job as a filing clerk, falls in love with a  co-worker (he's married and they're on the verge of on-the-rocks) who snubs  him repeatedly, and discovers in his office a door that opens into a portal  which allows the person entering it to get inside the head of John  Malkovich (portrayed by himself) for fifteen minutes. After being voided  from Malkovich, one is unceremoniously dumped into a ditch on the New  Jersey Turnpike-- a beautiful metaphor if I've ever seen one. The plot  can't get any more twisted? Hold your tongue! Of course, I can't _tell_ you  more about it without giving it away... you just gotta go.<br /><br />The film  was produced by R. E. M. vocalist Michael Stipe and is the full-length  directorial debut of music video guru Spike Jonze, perhaps best known for  his longtime association with the Beastie Boys. Whatever you may think of  their music, you have to admit, their videos are always something new and  unexpected. As is this film. It's twisted, it's mean, it's ugly, at times  it's funny as hell. It's two hours of sheer, utter, complete enjoyment...  but you walk out feeling guilty for having enjoyed it as much as you did.  Go. See it now. Laugh. Everyone else will feel more guilty about it than  you will.out-of-work  puppeteer (Cusack) gets a job as a filing clerk, falls in love with a  co-worker (he's married and they're on the verge of on-the-rocks) who snubs  him repeatedly, and discovers in his office a door that opens into a portal  which allows the person entering it to get inside the head of John  Malkovich (portrayed by himself) for fifteen minutes.

B0000025JT|5.0|A fairy tale come true. Beauty (Barry Gibb, gorgeous in looks and vocals) and the Beast (Barbra Streisand, fabulous vocally) teamed up for a fantastic musical adventure. Their voices matched perfectly and oddly  enough so did their opposite looks on the album cover and sleeves. Tho'  it's true that, counting the overdubs of background vocals, there's alot  more Barry on the album than Barbra, she really should be greatfull for  this multitalented man to have helped her boost her career and open up more  musical directions and audiences for her. Barry made me discover Barbra and  she hasn't been as exciting as on this album ever again.
6304080921|4.0|Bruce Willis once again proves he's one of Hollywood's most underrated serious actors, Brad Pitt once again proves he can take chances with the best of them, David Morse proves once again he's good at anything they ask, and Madeline Stowe proves  once again that, even though she can just be there and look good, she also  has considerable depth of talent-- Terry Gilliam gives us the hardest kind  of film to realize, a multiple mystery with many layers that is still fully  explained and satisfying by the end of the flick. Almost impossible to do  in two hours, if recent Hollywood mystery fare is to be believed.
B000002UDB|5.0|This is a great CD and is definitely a companion album to Sgt. Pepper's though it doesn't have the theme like Lonely Hearts Club it still has extremely trippy songs that have interesting and poignant lyrics.  &quot;Fool On The Hill&quot; is probably my favorite track and has a very  interesting story, but &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; is a great song as  well with a great sound to it, that makes you just want to float away.  And  then there is the classic &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; which can probably  only be understood under the influence of certain pharmaceutical products  but is nevertheless an intense and interesting song.  Overall a great album  even if it is merely a collection of a bunch of songs that would make great  singles.
6305537798|3.0|10 Things I Hate About You lived up to the generally good reviews I heard of it last year. A cast of relative unknowns, a well-established plot (The Taming of the Shrew), and the general young-and-beautiful feel-good-ness  all come together to make this at least an enjoyable experience, if not a  brilliant one. Soundtrack could have used a bit of tweaking, and I'd have  given anything to go to a high school that looked half that cool. *** 1/2
6305627347|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest and yet most poignant movies in recent history.  First of all let me mention as some many other people already have.  This movie is filled with bad language, sexual innuendos, and plain  old grossnes.  That being said I'm not sure this is not a movie for kids, I  think this movie is great for kids of a certain emotional age since it  contains a very important message (of course an adult should be present to  answer questions).  Censorship is wrong, and the truth is that kids are  going to find out about things they are not supposed to no matter what we  as adults and chaperones do.  The solution is not to shelter them and try  to keep them away from all of it the solution is to be loving, caring  individuals who can help them deal with all the strangeness and perversity  in the world.  Okay enough of my soapbox, back to this movie.<br />This movie  is great for many reasons.  First of all it predicts its own response.  The  movie is postmodern in the way it constantly makes innuendos that are  references to how people will treat and act on the movie itself.  Second  the movie is downright funny, many of the jokes are simply scatological and  anyone will laugh at them, but the truth is that much of the humor is very  intelligent and takes not only a knowledge of our popular culture but a  good liberal education in order to understand.  I also can not thank of any  other movie which was able to parody a movie which had just been released a  month before (Star Wars I).  Overall this movie is probably the funniest  movie of last year, and despite all of its vulgarity should be seen by  everyone.
0784011796|2.0|I wanted to like Pi. I'd heard hundreds of people, if not thousands, praise this movie to the high heavens. And, actually, everything they said was right. It's smart, it's fast-paced enough to leave the viewer  breathless, it's witty in its own twisted way, and it never shies away from  any of the gory details. It's a film that makes mathematics interesting.  It's informed by the Cronenberg/Giger axis of biomechanics, which cannot in  any way be a bad thing. So what was it about this film that left me cold?<br /><br />Two possibilities.<br /> 1. Many people also priased its originality--  wrongly. Pi came out not long after the whole Bible Code scam, and much of  the underlying plot is patterned on the Bible Code. I can't recall whether  it had been exposed as a scam by the time Pi was conceived (which would at  least make it satire), which is throwing me off. I'm willing to give  Aronofsky the benefit of the doubt here.<br /> 2. A simple problem  translating from big screen to small. It just didn't absorb me the way I  felt it would. I LIKE math.<br /><br />That's not to say there weren't elements  of the film that worked, and worked very well; Sean Gullette is an actor  from whom we should be hearing much more, the soundtrack is fantastic, and  Aronofsky may have a bright career in front of him if he can come up with  more original material. But this didn't live up to the hype... though it  could have.<br /><br />(It also didn't help that I kept comparing it, probably  subconsciously, to Eraserhead, a film I just can't stand.)
B00000ILBK|4.0|This is by far the best odd number Star Trek movies. In the past all odd numbers star Trek were condemned by critics but I think this one is pretty good. Not as good as First Contact but it is entertaining enough. The 5.1  Dolby digital sound is excellent and so is the video transfer. My only  concern is the omission of English subtitling option on the DVD.
6305718903|3.0|So I finally get to see this in the cheap seats. Patricia Arquette-- yum. Gabriel Byrne-- okay, well, every woman I know thinks he's the bees' knees. Jonathan Pryce really CAN play a scary guy. Interesting soundtrack, if a  little on the silly side (are you really going to hear pop electronica at  any club whose main piece of decor is chain link fence, one wonders?). Very  loose basing on factual events surrounding Nag Hammadi, and I mean VERY  loose (Brazilian priest yes, possessed stigmatic no). And despite this odd  wave of religious-themed media these days, film, at least, seems to be  taking a more intelligent approach to it than television. Instead of  mindless pap like Touched by an Angel and Providence, Stigmata seems to be  drawing from the Blatty/Friedkin axis, and that cannot ever be a bad thing  (well, okay, except for Exorcist II). You know the plot, right? Atheist  suddenly finds herself plagued with Christ's wounds, speaking in dead  languages, and writing on the walls of her apartment. Actually, it kind of  reminds me of a sexy blond John Denver in Oh, God. Happily, Byrne is a lot  more attractive than George Burns was.<br />  Once again, I walked out of  the theater with a sense of underwhelment that stemmed only from the film's  last ten minutes, just like in Sleepy Hollow. Stigmata is a stylized,  slick, well-processed tour-de-force right up until the end, where instead  of wrapping things up nicely (despite the fact that things COULD have been  wrapped up nicely quite easily, in any one of five or six different ways),  suddenly the screen goes black and we get some overlay text about Nag  Hammadi. All well and good, but what happened? Do Gabe and Patty get  married, go off, and make babies? Does Patty kick off and get a really nice  funeral? Does Gabe ever actually finish getting the haircut Patty starts to  give him? Does Patty's not-so-significant other get jealous and kill them  both in a fit of rage? And is that stupid statue really a miracle? All this  and more... we dunno. Still, I'd prefer the loose ends rather than Sleepy  Hollow's artificial tying-together, if not by much.<br /> (Note: I have been  told by others who saw the DVD version that it contains an alternate ending  that wraps everything up... so you may want to shell out the extra for the  DVD version.)le?

B00003CX5A|4.0|Everyone who has at least been through middle school knows of the legend of sleepy hollow.  And this film version, brought to the screen by the very talented Tim Burton, brings Sleepy Hollow to life the way it should be.  Although somewhat gory at times, which you have to expect if &quot;heads  are going to roll&quot;, the gore is not glorified.  Johnny Depp and the  very talented Christina Ricci play the lead roles and quite convincingly  also.  One of those few movies that actually take the original classic  story and bring it to life without tarnishing it.  GRADE: A-
B00003CXDV|4.0|Star Trek is probably, in my opinion, the most overrated shows and movies I have ever seen.  Which may be why I liked Galaxy Quest, because it pokes fun at the people who are obsessed with Star Trek and it's has been star's.   Tim Allen plays the actor who played the ego-maniac captain, sound like a  certain actor from Star Trek? Sigourney Weaver plays the beautiful blond  who plays the tight-uniform wearing actress from Galaxy Quest.  Which she  only gets interviews about her cleavage and not her career.  All the cast  members are suddenly swept away to another world where they must do what  they been acting like they were doing on TV years ago, in order to save  these alien's world.  The laughs are many and the fun is non-stop. A well  done film.  GRADE: A-
0553525964|4.0|For those of you who were once John Grisham fans but find his stories getting stale, I recommend switching to books on tape, which I have. On tape, the tale is streamlined down to the basic necessities of the plot and  things move quickly and keep me interested.<br />I found the development of  Nate O'Reilly's character to be interesting and though I'm no holy-roller  myself, I was happy for his transformation in the end and, like him, I was  in awe of Rachel.<br />As always, Grisham delivers a satisfying ending. The  bad guys don't always get harsh punishment (but they don't walk away  ecstatic, either) and the good guys don't have everything happen exactly as  they would have liked (but they are content).
0553260111|5.0|This is one of those books that when it is over, you wish it wasn't.  It is great reading, easy to understand, and a wonderful spy thriller.<br />A man awakens to find out he does not know who he is.  He is treated by an old  drunk doctor who finds him on the beach after he's been shot several times  and left for dead.  Who is this almost dead man?  Nobody knows, not even  the victim himself.<br />As the story progresses, the man figures out he must  be one Jason Bourne who is a paid assassin.  But is he really?  Or was he  set up?<br />This is an excellent thriller.  It is exciting, romantic, and  everyone is left feeling sorry for this man who seems to be a really nice  person, but who also thinks he's a killer.<br />I would recommend The Bourne  Identity to everyone who enjoys spy thrillers.
B00000IBRX|5.0|I found this movie to be a very touching and moving experience.  While I don't necessarily agree with some of the religious conclusions in it, it is still a very good and worthwhile movie.  The effects were incredible, the  music was good, and the casting and dialogue was right on the money.  Also,  I LOVED the ending.  While some others found the ending to be incomplete, I  found it to be understated, and as a result, more poignant and powerful  than it would have been otherwise.I'm not the sort of person to cry while  watching a movie.  In fact, I could probably count those experiences on one  hand.  However, there were SEVERAL points in this movie where I got a  little teary-eyed.  As a result, I HIGHLY recommend this movie, and gladly  give it 5 Stars.
B000002O51|5.0|I think many critics at the time did not think Boston could make it the late 86, early 87 rock market which was pure hair bands at the time!  Then this album comes out and Boston is siting on their first and only #1 smash  hit &quot;Amanda&quot;!  They also had the #9 single &quot;We're  Ready&quot; and #20 single &quot;Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me)&quot;  I  also love &quot;Cool The Engines.&quot;  This album showed the world what  Boston could do.  The last great album from them, but well worth the wait!
6304297912|5.0|This movie was great.  I found myself laughing at loud at parts and just shaking my head in disbelief at others.  I was impressed by the ending as much as the attention-grabbing beginning, which is rare in movies.  I'll  never touch heroine.
B000002572|5.0|Talk about an album that smoked every other album from that year!  The song writing is first class and the sound you hear is like no other album before or since.  I think just about every song on this album has become a  classic rock radio staple.  Pure magic!
B00004RFFI|4.0|Four stars -- an outstanding rating for a movie whose attempt at a plot should have been cut entirely.<br />I chose this film to christen my new subwoofer, and I couldn't have chosen better.  The storms growled, swirled,  rumbled, rattled, and shook everything in my apartment (not to mention  drawing the ire of my neighbors) simply some of  the best sounds I've ever  heard from DVD.  I was particularly impressed with the swirling of the wind  from speaker to speaker.  I had not seen &quot;Twister&quot; since it was  in the theater, and I must say it was nearly exactly as I remembered it.   It made me nervous about thunderstorms again . . . <br />If you have a home  theater system and want to see what it really can do, use  &quot;Twister&quot; as the test.
6301562925|3.0|michael myers is one of my favorite horror villains, but the character is getting boring. just as in 4, he is after his neice, killing off everyone in his path (what a suprise). there is gore galore and it is halloween, so  i give it three stars. fans of the series will like it, others will not.
0152465030|5.0|I felt that the Little Prince represents many aspects in our world.  I believe this book would be a great book for teachers and parents to read.  If I could require teachers and parents alike to read a book this would be  it.  I felt that this story helped me to see children in a different  perspective. It also helped me to see the world around us differently  through the eyes of a child.  Please read this book. Even though the book  may seem like it is not for you, please give it a try it has a lot of deep  thoughts hidden within its pages.
6304675348|4.0|scream is a great horror flick. great death scenes, suspense, psychos.. its cool. unfortunately, it will spawn a long series or sequels with no point. see it though, its got the eighties horror flick twist (teenagers  being slaughtered).
185984054X|2.0|As a Catholic after recovering my shock at this book and the various reviews (AH HA NOW WE SEE THROUGH THAT CHARLITON etc...!) I decided to read this book myself to see what was being said.  I found the book compact and  easy to read and much to my surprise VERY AMUSEING!<br />    It wasn't the  facts as presented that amused me.  They were presented in a fairly  straight forward manner.  It wasn't the attacks on Mother Teresa's order  methods from the doctor or the nurse.  Both have the right to their opinion  aquired first hand though apparently the vast majority of people who also  have the same first hand knowledge would disagree.  It wasn't even the  attacks on her for not rejecting people like Baby Doc, and Keating (I note  the authors political leanings glaring out when he lumps Reagan with that  group.)  It doesn't seem odd to myself that a person unwilling to reject  the lowest of the low of the poor and feeble would reject anybody from any  station (that is the whole tennent of Christianity love of neighbor not of  GOOD neighbors only) I'm sure that Mr. Hitchens would be happy to provide  us all with an approved list of people we can associate with to be  considered saintly.<br />  The two things that got me laughing out loud was  his SHOCKING DISCOVERY that a Roman Catholic Nun would have Roman Catholic  Beliefs and would consider her primary mission to spread those beliefs!   And his belief apparently in a Vast Vatican Conspiracy against the world of  which he considers Mother Teresa a part.  How amazing that a member of a  religious order would consider the salvation of souls the most important  thing there is above all else.  I'm reminded of Lincoln when asked about  slavery to paraphrase:  &quot;My primary purpose is to save the Union, If I  can save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; If I can save it by  freeing none of the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing  some and leaving others in bondage I would do that too.&quot;Apparently  her and her orders ACTIONS are inaquate since they don't come to the  standard of Mr. Hitchens FEELINGS on how they should be done.  Once again  we see the example one who FEELS the right way is superior to one who ACTS  and doesn't reach the level demanded by the feelings of the other.  (For  myself I don't see how refusing medical care offer to her would have made  the lives of others better.) I'm sure that using the profits from this book  and others the Hitchens hospice for the dying will do much better.  Who  would believe that a Catholic Nun would be more concerned with the soul  than the body?  Amazing!  It is even more amusing to see Mr Hitchens make  his arguement that it is all part of the evil Roman Catholic Churches'  master plan.  It displays a complete ignornace or misunderstanding of  Christianity in general and the Roman Catholic church in particular at best  or at worst a complete UNDERSTANDING of the Church and its message  concerning the soul, that this world is transitory vs eternity.  To any  reader of this book I must recommend C.S. Lewis' Classic THE SCREWTAPE  LETTERS (in particular #28) I suspect the reader will find its arguemnts  similar to what he reads here.<br />  In short Mr. Hitchens makes the  following arguement:  The Roman Catholic Church is an evil conspiracy; (All  dogs are pink.)  Mother Teresa is a member in high standing of the church;  (Lou is a Dog) THEREFORE Mother Teresa is not a potential saint or even a  doer of good works but mearly a cog in that conspiricy to harm mankind.  (Therefore Lou is Pink.)  The intelligent man, well read in history, will  see through this arguement (DOGS AREN'T PINK) in the same way the child saw  the emperor had nothing on.  The incidious plan of the church if there is  one is to repeat to all people in the world the offer of forgivness and  salvation that Jesus Christ continues to make to all.  If this is the  conspiracy that Mr. Hitchens fears then I suggest that he needs Mothers  prayers far more than the dying in her followers care.
0805017305|5.0|As someone of Native American descent, I grew up with this book. To me, it is one of the most important books ever written on the &quot;Indian Wars&quot;. Upon reading this book you can realize why American Indians are  offended by the US celebrating &quot;Colombus Day&quot; and the images and  flasehoods that surround the &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; holidays. It is a  riveting, truthful account that will make you re-think the things you were  taught in your history class. Let me give you fair warning, however, it is  a dense and information packed historical account, not a novel and not  light reading.
6303039456|5.0|This movie is great.  I always cry at the end, even though we all know what happens.  Its just so touching.  Even though it is a loose adaptation of the true story, it gets the gist.  A failed track star from Jamaica who  will do anything to get to the Olympics finds John Candy, a disgraced  Olympic bobsledding gold medalist.  The most unlikely ensues: a Jamaican  bobsled team...even though they've never SEEN snow.  Against all odds, they  make the Olympics.  This movie, again--a loose adaptation, teaches a  complex but important lesson: be true to who and what you are, persevere.   But most of all, it teaches the simple lesson of the dignity that we all  have within us, if we will let show.
630587493X|4.0|First off, I am very surprised that there weren't many extras on this dvd. Sure there was the standard theatrical trailer, and aside from a five minute promo included there wasn't much else. That was rather  disappointing.<br />The movie itself shows the lifespan of a robot named  Andrew who's played by Robin Williams. I thought the movie was very  touching. It showed us what the most important things in life are. As for  all the moral lessons aside, parts of this movie were visually stunning,  particularly one shot of a future Golden Gate Bridge and surrounding  scenery.<br />I rented this movie, and I think I might eventually buy it. It  is really quite enjoyable.
0061020710|5.0|I have a confession to make.  I've read a lot of Terry Pratchett books over the last two years or so.  I've enjoyed them immensely.  However, because The Color of Magic was basically out of print (or just really  really hard to find), I had never read the first two novels in the  Discworld series.  Now, after finally reading The Color of Magic and The  Light Fantastic I'm embarassed I didn't try harder to get my hands on these  books earlier.<br />If you've never read Pratchett before, this is definitely  a great book to start with.  Summarizing what makes Pratchett fun to read  isn't that easy.  Maybe it's his utterly goofy take on what makes people  tick or maybe it's how his characters, despite being goofy inhabitants of a  weird world, seem to remind you vaguely of distant family members.   Whatever it is, Pratchett is one reading addiction that won't leave you  unsatisfied   for the most part.  Come one, buy this book, you won't regret  it!<br />Now, if you're in the same boat as I was and you've read some  Pratchett but much to your embarassment haven't ever read the start of the  Discworld series, what are you waiting for?  Believe it or not, there  _really_ are some things that you've missed out on by not having read this  book.  As per normal, this book will leave you rolling in the aisles or  falling out of your chair.  If you've read some of the books featuring  Death, pay close attention to what he's like in this book...  You'll notice  some differences.  But hey, that's part of what makes Discworld fun!  In  addition, when your friends who have read The Color of Magic make jokes  about Rincewind, you'll now be in a position to understand them.<br />Overall,  I can't think of a single reason that you shouldn't buy this book and the  2nd Discworld novel, The Light Fantastic.  You'll have a great time reading  them.
0385493622|4.0|&quot;Fermat's Enigma&quot; is a fun and interesting look at a world most of us are only vaugely aware of.  Beginning in Ancient Greece, Singh takes us on a quick journey through mathmatical history, with brief stops at the  French Revolution, Post-WWII Japan, and more.  The book culminates with the  story of Andrew Wiles's brilliant and troubled breakthrough.  Very little  math knowledge is needed to enjoy this book; in fact, there wasn't ENOUGH  math to satisfy me.  If you want details, this isn't for you.  But if you  want the basics, and the wacky story behind them, &quot;Fermat's  Enigma&quot; is perfect.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|For the band that, I would say, created what is now metal whether Pantera and Fear Factory know or wish to know, I cannot slam any album. I will always find something to savor on an Iron Maiden album, but it seems all  great old metal bands have experienced the &quot;90's&quot; syndrome. Take  a listen...        Though the first songs sounds frighteningly like Grim  Reaper (who pathetically tried to sound like Iron Maiden), &quot;Ghost of  The Navigator&quot; picks up the pace. The guitars pound, chug and soar  harmoniously(in that order). The rhythms twist and turn and explode into  majestic, operatic choruses like a starved pitbull let out of a cage.  Bruce, in turns, wails and growls and slips into vibrato any chance. Only  Iron Maiden can do this.        And while this album is quite entertaining,  it also sounds a bit too familiar for my comfort. The music is much heavier  and more energetic than the last two albums, which were, in my opinion,  interesting but not really metal. It falls somewhere between the epic  orchestration of The X-Factor and Virtual XI, and the energy of their 80's  output. But while the songs they have written are great songs, I long for  something less predictable, a shaking of the song structures or a twist to  catch the listener off guard.         Instead, Iron Maiden write the same  way the have been for the past 15 years, and what's worse, they seem to  have grasped the mood of the metal 90's in a bad way-there is not one shred  of hope for humanity or optimism in the lyrics of this record, and the  music constantly runs in the apocalyptic mood with no break. All other Iron  Maiden records had at least one break for some cheerful  release-&quot;Judgement of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;,  &quot;The Clansman&quot;, &quot;Hooks in You&quot;-to vary the mood and  keep one entertained.          I also found the production thin and  compressed, another 90's syndrome. I appreciate the sharper guitars, but  Bruce Dickinson's voice is rendered dry and the orchestrations are all on  the surface. In other words, though the record is exceptionally played, it  lacks atmosphere.          All this aside, there is more than enough drama  and musicianship to keep any blue-blooded metalhead entertained. I  particularly like &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;; the sentiments of this slow  song are quite moving, and Bruce provides one of his most passionate  performances. Though the song is superficially about a world in decay, it  feels like an expression of the metal angst which seems to unite metalheads  in this world. &quot;The Nomad&quot; introduces some powerful,  quasi-eastern melodys and is very affective. &quot;The Thin Line Between  Love and Hate&quot; is one of their best closers. A classic build with more  chaos then usual, it features a drawn-out, clean harmonized solo at the end  that leaves one stunned as it winds down like the end to a Star Wars flick.  It's too bad that much of this album is closer to the decaying Aliens  franchise.         Jaded listeners will find this album redundant, but for  hardcore Iron Maiden fans-and these are many-are sure to love Brave New  World. This is a fine return to form, if nothing else. That is all I need  from these guys.
B00004STPT|5.0|When two film composers work together on a film one wonders will there styles connect or be totally different. As For The last Of The Mohicans Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman worked together on that film. Jones' music  worked but Edelman's was mor efiller music than anything else. But that is  something you can't say about this collaboration between one of Hollywood's  top composers and a relative newcomer.<br />Hans Zimmer who is no stranger to  action films mastered the action scene next to Jerry Goldsmith. Lisa  Gerrard who's only other scoring assignment was Michael Mann's The Insider.  Gerrard former member of Dead can dance. She works with Hans Zimmer.<br />To  score Ridley Scott's new epic film Gladiator. Zimmer who is no stranger to  action handles it with almop. While Lisa Gerrard handles the more tender  and emotional parts. Zimmer handles the epic granduer from the action  scenes to the dark pieces. Lisa Gerrard is able to lend some emotional  depth to Russel Crowe's Maximus. In the last track We are free combines  Zimmers music with Gerrards haunting vocals. her voice is very haunting and  etheral. this is clearly her track nor Zimmers. The music is thrilling  emotional and haunting. I can't wait to see What Lisa Gerrards next scoring  assignment will be. I think we may have found the best newcomer. last year  it was Trevor Rabin this year it is Lisa Gerrard
B00000IL1K|4.0|Okay, here I go for the last time (I hope, because I've been writing zillions of reviews for the same albums!). When I first heard about this album, I was stunned to learn that its predecessor, \\"Timeless\\" (a.k.a.  \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\"), was an international smash hit, and that this one  followed in its footsteps. When I did get \\"Eden,\\" I was surprised by the  title track, even though it tends to sound like she's imitating Madonna.  (On the \\"One Night in Eden\\" video, she actually DRESSES sort of like  Madonna!) <br />I don't think that this album as a whole is as surprising as I  thought, regardless of whether it's the follow-up to the much better \\"Time  To Say Goodbye.\\" However, there are some songs which caught my attention:  her Italian-language rendition of Céline Dion's hugely popular \\"My Heart  Will Go On.\\" Both versions don't sound very much different, but it would be  better if Andrea Bocelli sang the song. Richard Marx' \\"The Last Words You  Said\\" literally brought me to tears. Another catcher was \\"Only An Ocean  Away,\\" but no time for that.<br />Numerically speaking, this album sold almost  better than \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\" did. And I see that almost 300 reviews  went to this album, compared to only over 100 for its predecessor. I gave  this album 4 stars because it doesn't have as much powerful sound as  \\"Timeless\\" (\\"Time To Say Goodbye,\\" whatever), but it's okay...I guess.
6305558167|5.0|In my opinion, the movie was very well written and directed. The actors were not the best actors but they were very good. I liked the way the story actually covered both the Christian and Pagan sides of King Aurthur and the  Knights of the Round Table. Very good in the fantasy department. The  costumes were beautiful. The soundtrack was excellent. The movie is good  enough to watch over and over and still not tire of it.
6302648750|5.0|Death Becomes Her is a hilarious comedy about two girls:Madeline Ashton,  and Helen Sharp.  Helen is going to get married to Ernest, a docter.  One  night they attend one of Madeline's plays, she's an actress on Broadway,  and Ernest falls for her, and after telling Helen that he has no interest  for Madeline, he marries Madeline.  7 years later.  Helen is a extremly  large woman who does not care about anything else except killing Madeline.   After misunderstanding a docter, she goes to illimanate Madeline.  7 years  later.  Ernest, instead of being a surgeon, is an undertaker and a drunk.   Madeline is despretly trying to look younger, especially when her old  friend, Helen Sharp, invites her to a party.  When Ernest and Madeline see  Helen, they gasp.  She is extremly skinny, and looks 28, instead of 50.   Ernest is very babbled!  Helen, at work, had been given an address from a  person who said it will make her look younger.  She imediatly goes, and  meets Lisa, who gives Madeline a potion, which makes her younger forever.   Now, I'm being so detailed!!  Anyway, to make a long story short, (too  late) Madeline and Helen have a funny time fighting eachother, though they  cannot die.  Starring Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis, and Goldie Hawn.
B000031X7T|5.0|This live concert from 20 years ago is simply awesome!  It matches the quality and feeling put into Pulse.  This limited release contains a very well put together booklet that any Pink Floyd fan must have.  Grab it  before its gone!
0451169514|5.0|IT is such a good book, words can't describe it. The characters are so real I feel like I know them. When there is a death in this book I feel like I'm losing a friend. IT is a scary book, but it is also touching the  way the seven friends are so close and how they band together to defeat the  evil force in the town of Derry, Maine. Even if you don't like horror  novels, read this because it is more than that. This book made me laugh,  cry, and scream with fear. Stephen King is a great writer.
B00004TEX1|5.0|This double-CD live album from Pink Floyd is a must-have for any PF fan!  It ranks up there in quality with Pulse.  The recording is superb and the feeling that the band put into this concert 20 years ago makes you lose  yourself in the surrealistic tunes again and again.  Contained in this set  is the best live performances I've heard of Mother, Goodbye Blue Sky, and  Comfortably Numb.  Nothing could be better, except for a new tour by Pink  Floyd.  Grab this one now and you won't be sorry!
B00003W8NM|5.0|from a previous review--&quot;It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to attack the establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.&quot; NO SIR, you are comical, and you should think  about that as I can tell you are a thinking person.  This movie is art, and  not just pablum. There is something stirring in hollywood these days, and i  think it's the desire to create a new era of film making beyond the general  publics imagination. BRAVO to this film.  The only criticism I have is that  the french version makes Ed and Brad sound more like men than their true  voices. The american innnocent boyishness is all to persasive in our cult  hero status. This &quot;Opey&quot; brainwashing, though it has been  effective during this time of american androgony has run it's course. It's  time for hollywoods leading males to stop &quot;sounding&quot; like boys  and make the noise of MAN.
B00002Z88D|5.0|S&amp;M is a great cd set.  It's not perfect, but definately worth buying.  Metallica is awesome live, and this is one of the best albums around.  Sometimes the symphony doesn't blend well with the guitars and drums, but  for the most part it sounds awesome, adding to the music and making it  amazingly powerful.  The way the first three songs are kind of blended  together is awesome, making for an incredibly powerful 20 something minutes  of music.  Every song is great, but I wish they had included The Unforgiven  and Fade to Black.  Yes, James' voice is smoother now, but he can still  growl if he wants to (listen to -human).  I could go on forever talking  about each song and how great it is, and how the symphony added to it.   After listening to Metallica with the symphony, when you go back and listen  to the studio albums, it almost feels like something is missing.  Anyway,  buy this album, it is incredible.  And all you people whining about the  whole Napster deal, quit your crying and go buy albums like everyone else.
0440234743|4.0|After 'The Partner' &amp; 'The Street Lawyer' I was fed up with John Grisham' s flat formulas.  Someone loaned me a worn paperback of 'The Testament' on a long flight and it revived my interest and trust in  Grisham.<br />'The Testament' is rich in setting and character.  I  particularly liked the in-depth perspective of the main character, Mr.  O'Reily.   He was flawed, but more real than many of Grisham's more recent  catalysts.  The legal matters in DC provided decent tension.  The ending  and satisfaction were better than most Grisham epics where the author can't  usually finish stories.<br />The river descriptions get a bit tedious and  Grisham is continuing to be preachy - an unfortunate trend that began in  'The Chamber' and reached a peak of misery in 'The Street Lawyer.'  In  total I enjoyed 'The Testament' and  I may buy 'The Brethern' rather than  borrow it.
0790738139|4.0|Most people know what a good movie this is so who cares about my opinion.<br />I have been a big Kevin Spacey fan since I first saw him as Mel Profit on &quot;Wise Guy&quot; talking to his big toes.  That was a  character.  Kevin Spacey was my initial draw to this film and I like Kim  Basinger and it looked like an interesting character for her to play.<br />I  enjoyed Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce very much, was surprised to find out  they were from Australia and New Zealand and the rest is history.
B00004STPT|5.0|I believe that Zimmer's discography didn't until now include a composition as fabulous (and I'm including work like Peacemaker and Crimson Tide in this comparison) as what he made for Gladiator.<br />Why? The combination of  epic elements with the wonderful voice of Lisa Gerrard (former member of  the band Dead Can Dance). There are moments of incredible force in this  movie's music, like during the battle scenes (track 3) or those of the  fights in the coliseum. But what really is moving is how Zimmer balances  that force with a profound emotion like that found in the closing piece.<br />When you begin to hear the album, I promise you won't stop for several  years.
0800139151|3.0|Continuing with &quot;My Opinion&quot;. This really only rates 2 1/2 out of 5 stars.<br />Since the reason I watched all of these movies was to see Russell Crowe's performances I was stuck watching other actors that I don't  really enjoy or some that I do but not in this. I just didn't care for this  film. The plus was that a big studio finally decided to look at Russell  Crowe even if Sharon Stone made them. Finally there are some sparks here  and there of his potential.
B000002MM8|5.0|I was so impressed by the first song. The production is so good, that the instrument (I think it's a shaker) actually feels as if it were inside the room where you are.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I don't normally like to review albums that have already been reviewed by so many others, but Brave New World is such an astonishing CD, I feel that I must add my opinion to those that have come before. There are so many  epic cuts on this album - the title track, &quot;Ghost of the  Navigator&quot;, &quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;, and  &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; to name but a few. Metal Hammer's recent  suggestion that &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; is a contender for  Maiden's greatest song ever is no overstatement! It is amazing that this  album could be so good considering that Steve Harris' trademark  &quot;galloping&quot; bass is nowhere near as prominent on BNW as it was  during Maiden's golden years in the 1980s. The emphasis during the creation  of BNW was clearly placed on great songwriting. It also doesn't hurt that  Bruce Dickinson has returned to the Maiden fold, his vocals arguably better  than ever. This is an album to treasure! I received it for my 30th birthday  recently and I can honestly say it is one of my greatest birthday presents  ever.
B00000K19E|5.0|This has become in my mind a sci-fi classic already. The reasons?<br />-Brilliant special effects -some might say none were groundbreaking. So what? The way in which they were integrated into a the story was just perfect.<br />-A great story. The perfect combination for a classic:  compelling, universal and not-limited by time boundaries.<br />Only thing I'd  change: Keanu Reeves....
B000004712|5.0|Herbie Hancock did it again.... Great work. I would recommend this album not only to Jazz musicians, fans, Berklee students, but to everyone interested in a higher level of musicianship.
B00000K19E|4.0|This is not a movie that requires a lot of thought to watch it.  The movie was done completely for the special effects, the stop frame photograghy and computer effects.  A lot of credit goes to the special effects personal.  The acting is nothing special, everyone did a good job but no one did any  acting that deserves particular attention. The plot is simple, and the  story line keeps your attention long enough to get you to the next action  or special effect sequence. Its simple a movie to watch and enjoy the  visual effects.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This CD shows how incredibly awesome Metallica truely is. This is better than any recorded CD they have. This CD is a must have for anyone who likes just one Metallica song. I originally only liked Until it Sleeps, then i  bought this, and now Metallica is my favorite band. James is awesome on  vocals, with an amazing symphony.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This moive was great! I cannot believe the special effects.  Of course Keanu did a great job of portraying Neo.  I cant wait till the matrix 2!
0805062971|4.0|Like other reviewers, I wish I had read the book before I saw the movie.  But I'm glad I read the book anyways.  The movie follows the book very closely and is EXTREMELY well written.  I did like the ending in the movie  better than that of the book though.  I can't wait to read more books by  Palahniuk.  FIGHT CLUB RULES!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite movie of 1999.  The characters are cast well,  everything is visually spectacular, the soundtrack was brilliant, the plot  took me by surprise...  etc, etc, etc. COMPLAINT:  The dvd is supposed to  have commentary by the cast, director, and author, but on my dvd it will  not play any of them.  This may be a problem with my player, although  that's never happened before.  Just want to tell the people who were really  looking forward to viewing commentaries that perhaps they should purchase  this at a local store in case it does not work for you either and you  decide to return it.   Anyhow, this movie is great and I think the entire  violence and anarchist themes the media criticizes are overblown.  There is  more violence in the first 5 minutes of Saving Private Ryan than there is  in this entire movie, and to the best of my memory, only one person dies in  the movie, which really isn't much of a body count at all.  So yeah...   this is a good movie and deserves a viewing at the very least.  I'd say buy  it, but it isn't for everybody, so rent it first and decide for yourself.
0679805273|4.0|Another classic by Dr. Seuss! We all should bottle the optimism that is contained in these pages. I like this book because of the sense of adventure it bestows on the theme of facing change in life. As with all  Seuss, there are lessons to learn for young and old alike in this book. I  recommend it.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Here's what this cd is, entertainment. Don't take offense to it, if you don't like his mouth don't buy it or let your kids listen to it. I think he is on top of the world and feeling the effects of being a celebrity. But  the cd is entertaining and I was able to listen to the whole thing again  and again. If you don't like swearing this cd is not for you.

B00000IQMT|5.0|I love this soundtrack!  I love &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; and &quot;Augie's Great Municipal Band.&quot; They are both very wonderful.  I don't really mind that they are out of order, because I can program my CD  player to play the songs in the order that I want.  This music is great to  read to and to just daydream with.  I would recommend this CD to ANY Star  Wars or soundtrack fan!  I am a little disappointed about the lack of some  of the other songs on the movie, though.

B000002UKS|5.0|The most deep and passionate songs in a long time!   This CD takes me to a place that only One person could ever know...
B000000WG4|3.0|I came to know this CD, strangely enough, after hearing a MIDI of it.  Imagine a twenty-two long minute MIDI!  Anyhow, when I found out that it was Tubular Bells, I sought to find it and I eventually did.<br />It's too bad  that MIDI can't take into account voices.  Don't get me wrong, the  announcement of the instruments as they come in on the first part of this  album is nice.  It blends in quite well with the sounds around it.  Those  tubular bells themselves do sound quite amazing.<br />But it's late in the  second track where it just goes downhill to me.  I liked it all of the way  up to the werewolf-like grunting and screaming.  In fact, the first time I  heard it, I couldn't believe it.  Grunt, groans, and howling?  What the  heck is this?  In some ways, the very length of the tracks (over twenty  minutes each) is Tubular Bells' downfall.  It's not like I can just skip  the howling and go to another track.<br />So, I give this album three stars.   I did enjoy the first track but the cartoonish roaring at the end ruined  something otherwise very nice.

0316548189|4.0|Wonderful story of the man's life, much of which i didn't, of course, previously know.  He is occasionally a little more defensive ~ explaining his position or actions ~ than i would choose, still, it is his own  autobiography, and he can choose how to present himself; and not quite as  able to explain his motivations, his changing motivations, as would have  been useful.  Philosophically, i do disagree with him about the use of and  the need for violence in the struggle for freedom; it is easy to do that,  however, from a relatively free country (the US), being one of the  priviliged minority in the world. His openness to accept even those utterly  opposed to him certainly shows him to be a singular character.  As with  most autobiographies, how he says it reveals more about himself than what  he actually says; it was delightful, interesting, and unusual, to read this  and see underlying the words the accepting, open, and essentially honest  man.  Surely those who know Mandela are honoured to do so.
B00004HYLF|1.0|Yes indeed, this album does owe more to Yes and ELP than to any jazz influences - it really is that ghastly. The nadir of jazz/rock - self-indulgence, pomposity and pretentiousness. Thank God the seventies are  gone, a dreadful, dreadful record.
158234082X|5.0|Bourdain writes with precision and humor.  For those who have been in the restaurant business in any capacity, welcome home.  For those who think they wish to be there, read on.  Bourdain does an excellent job of showing  his world in food and cooking with honesty and wit.  Bourdain also makes  sure to point out the exceptions to his rules, providing the stories of  other chefs and restaurants.  After reading MFK Fisher (excellent author)  many years ago, I found that Bourdain brings the modern version of eating  to readers with the same breath of truth in food.  Of course, I found  myself going back to MFK Fisher and reading her delights in the same  &quot;simple peasant&quot; foods that Bourdain also delights in partaking  on his days off.  This is a book for my shelf next to Fisher.
B00004SPYJ|5.0|Heartbreaking story made even more heartbreaking by the two teenager leads.  Beautiful scenarios, costume designs, cinematography, and of, course, MUSIC.  What the hell the Academy was thinking when they DID NOT even nominate Nino Rota's hauntingly beautiful score?  I just checked out  the nominess in that category that year.  And it is a perfect joke.  Ladies  and gentlemen, this is perhaps one of the most famous themes coming out of  movie, certainly comparable to 'lara's theme' from Doctor Zhivago...
0440219078|5.0|This book was excellent. I recommend it to anyone! Iv'e read ita couple times. Its a great story!
B00000G09Q|2.0|This movie plays off of the success of its predecessors, and the plot really starts to suffer with this one.  I thought that the first one was great, and the second was so-so, but this is too much.  A poorly thought  out plot, and some very bad clichs make this movie barely worth a rent
044651652X|3.0|This novel is a real mind-blower. Not in terms of being a book, in that regard it's little more than a fast-food hamburger. But in terms of its cultural signifigance, its staggering. The writing is simplistic and the  plot is threadbare. And yet...its an American phenomenon. Oprah based a  whole hour on the book and movie. By the way, the movie is better than the  book, catching the flavor of the story real well. What does it say about us  as a country that we devour something like this and elevate it to classic  status? Maybe it doesn't say so much about us as people (most of us are a  sucker for a good romance, myself included), as it says something about  what the literary world is offering up these days.<br />I guess everyone knows  the story by now, I won't elaborate on the plot. But one thing I will say  is that Waller's character's did behave in a rather realistic way I  thought. People are out there falling in love every day for all the wrong  reasons, Robert and Francesca are just another version. The romance came  about slowly and innocently enough. The ending rang true, with many of  these type novels that doesn't happen. It also gives us a story about  common, everyday people, which in the romantic genre is VERY difficult to  come by. I personally can't relate to romance in the high fashion world,  among royalty or the rich and famous. It had a good atmosphere, one all its  own. And that might have been the intangible that really made it  work.<br />Its easier to find faults with this book than to praise it. It  lacks style, prose and plot, yet its a monster of a bestseller. Give credit  where its due. Waller scored big time. Pulling at the heartstrings can  often be the most powerful tool available.
B00000099Y|5.0|nima is the best album released in the 90's in my opinion, I've heard many albums by many artist but this thing is so diffrent, it's weird in a way and very avant-garde, it's complex and really artistic. this album is a  dark trip and you must pay a lot of attention while you listen to it in  order to actually catch the magic in it because your mind will not adjust  it so easily, it is powerful stuff. those guys are something above the  music industry of todays. GET IT!
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Ok, Don't get me wrong. I love Maiden. I have been listening to them since late '85. I was happy to hear Bruce and Adrian come back to the fold. I was hoping they would kick Janick out of the band at least for BNW. He ain't  that great and a bit of a showoff. But they did get together and put out a  decent album. While not reaching Powerslave or SIT, it is ok. It is a  little muddy and some songs are too long with boring solos.Trading solos  with 3 guitars don't work at least with me.I would def. go see them. I have  wanted to see them since SIT. But kudos to the boys as old as they are they  have spunk left in them yet.
B000007T1M|4.0|When my friend gave me this cd in a trade for one of mine, I dident know what to expect. I had heard &quot;sugar&quot; which I absoulutly hate, and &quot;Spiders&quot; which is a great song.  Well I had heard alot about   &quot;Suite-pee&quot;, &quot;War?&quot; and &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot;. So at  first listen this cd, preety much sounds all like a bunch of loud yelling  songs. But its more than that. Ill rate the songs 1=weak 2=why? 3=Average  4=very very good 5=exclent<br />Suite-pee=5, Know=4, Sugar=2,  Suggestions=4,<br />Spiders=5, Ddevil=4, Soil=5, War=5, Mind=3, Peephole=3,  Cubrt=3, Num 12=4, Pluck=5,
0425129586|5.0|All I can say is wow.  This is such a great book.  Ten people who are all complete strangers are invited out to an isolated island for a vacation.  When the host doesn't show up and people start dropping like flies, you  start to really get into the book.  This is one that you won't want to put  down.  It involves several mysteries, including who is the murderer, who  will die next and the mysterious past of the characters.  This is  definately one of the best Agatha Christie books.  Also, (take it from me  because I'm a kid) it's great for kids and adults.  You gotta read this  one!
B00000IPAX|5.0|I had heard alot about this album &quot;Enema of the state&quot;. My friends told me about how good this album, so I bought it. I must admit, this is one of the best albums that I have EVER bought in my life. It is  well worth the money. &quot;Adam's Song&quot; is a song which many  teenagers can relate their life too. It is about depression and how you  suddenly feel like commiting suicide but you just have to know that better  days will come. &quot;What's my age again&quot; is one of the best songs  becaues it is funny and enjoyable and it's just an awesome song to put on  when you are just in your room with nothing to do. The guitars make the  song sound awesome and the words are the funniest. This is definately an  album every Blink 182 fan should buy, definately this is a five out of  five!
B00004RFFM|1.0|This movie is probably one of the worst movies of the 1990s.  It's depressing because the only good actor in the movie gets killed off...I guess sharks are attracted to good actors...they have good  taste.<br />Everyone in this movie is so stupid that its attempts at being  serious makes your stomach turn.  The girl gets killed because she jumps  into the ocean with blood on her hands, and can't get out.  How dumb can  you possibly get?  The sharks weren't smart at all; the people were too  stupid to outwit a shark.  The sharks didn't follow the people; they just  followed the water.<br />It's kind of ironic because they're looking for a  cure of Alzheimer's, but it seems they have forgotten about their common  sense. God, how awful. <br />I don't know if you noticed, but a movie isn't  terrifying if the people in the movie do stupid stuff to get into a  &quot;scary&quot; situation.  The Exorcist is a scary movie, not this.   This is like Jaws and The Real World put together.
B000002GW5|4.0|Even though I was born in 1973,I am a huge fan of &quot;classic rock&quot;. I love all the older bands including Jackson Browne...Many say that this album lacks much of the style and feel of his other albums, but  It has been my favorite Jackson Browne album for about 18 years. The album  does capture a great spontaneous sound and feel. Truly a good addition to  any collection.

B00004T9UF|5.0|The world better get ready for this hard-hiting artist who does not care what anyone thinks.  Em is a great rapper people hate him because he is real and talks about their loved ones.  Like he said stop looking for him to say something bad and try to see where he's coming from and bump the CD.   The Marshall Mathers LP has some hard hitting stuff. My favorite  Please II is the best song with callabo's with Dre, Snoop, Exhibit,and of  couse the talented Nate Dogg welcomes you back to the west coast flavor.   Thats not the only song thats tight even the skits are tight. Feel sorry  for you Insane Clown Posse!  If you have not bought the CD buy it you be  glad you did!
B000002GQJ|5.0|Isn't it always a Question of Balance?    Now I know what ...  , It's Philosophy Rock! <br />I hope the &quot;CD&quot; cover opens up 'off balance' like the album cover does.  This is a pretty fun bunch of music for all  that.  Too bad I was only 10 yrs old in 1970 when this came out.  <br />'I'm a  Melancholy Man ...

B00000099Y|5.0|I have been listing to hard music for about 6 or seven years of my short life (16 years) and I still have never heard any thing quite like the force known as TOOL! There is no Genre for the music! Its heavy, but its not metal, its soft, but in no means is it alternitive. they have been called  the thinking mans metal band, but I just call them my favorite band of all  time! What else can you call an amazingly original guitarist like Adam  Jones, or a bassist such as Justin Chancoler who lives up to the name  bottom feeder. Danny Carrey is just a drum god! the man has tallent! but  the element that makes tool,tool,is the strikingly haunting, and beautiful  voice of Maynard James Keenan! I would have to put Maynard at the top of my  greatest vocalists of all time list! AENIMA is not the best album is you  ask me, but it come pretty damn close. I think it would have been better if  they got rid of tracks like useful idiot, and Ions. But this album is still  a classic! Its nearly 4 years old, and I still listen to it every week!

0140013997|5.0|I cannot remember when I enjoyed reading a book so much as this one. It is about the five years the author (Lawrence Durrell's younger brother) spent living on the island of Corfu as a youngster and budding naturalist. It is  full of anecdotes about collecting animals and about the family that  delight the heart and tickle the funnybone. His collection of animals  includes snakes, birds, furry things. There is a collection of dogs with  peculiar names. Theodore Stephanides, a real life person, a doctor who  helps Gerald organize his collection in more or less scientific fashion,  figures in some of Lawrence Durrell's writings. He  was apparently a  wonderful and possibly brilliant person. Concerned over the young boy's  education, or lack of it, his mother sends him a few times a week to the  Belgian consul, who tries to teach him French by reading out of the  dictionary, starting with ''A''. Of course he learns no French. The consul  spends most of the lesson time shooting mangy cats on neighboring roofs.  This is not an act of cruelty: the town is overpopulated by cats and they  are mostly ill and dying and spreading disease. Then Mother sends him to a  British person with a Slavic surname for lessons in just about everything.  This strange looking man has a collection of rare birds and a mother who  never leaves her bed but has wonderful fantasies about her own lost beauty.  Older brother Lawrence is, of course, a writer still learning his craft.  Leslie is the gun expert who builds the youngster a strange boat for use in  collecting marine specimens. Margo is the sister who cares for little in  life but how she looks in a bathing suit. Spiro is a hefty Greek with a big  belly who drives the family around in his car and helps them in unexpected  ways, even getting them out of innocent scrapes with police and customs  officials. The mother is a marvelously sensible English lady who behaves  very properly and cooks up a storm, almost constantly.  The author's  language and style are elegant, and one gets the sense of looking at the  world through the wondering eyes of a young boy, but always with the idea  that behind him there is the mature and accomplished writer. Yes, reading  this one again next week would not be a bad idea.language and style are elegant, and one gets the sense of looking at the  world through the wondering eyes of a young boy, but always with the idea  that behind him there is the mature and accomplished writer.

I couldn't truly understand why Patrick trusted her, would love to ask John Grisham that. I knew she was shaky.I  love the scheme and the way he planned his death, but always felt it would  be in vain. I would recommend this book.

They have loud songs like, &quot;Kim,&quot; and &quot;Kill You,&quot; and if you  hate pop, &quot;I'm Back,&quot; is perfect for you.  I think this CD is  better then his first CD.  He expresses his feelings and emotions more, and  he knew what to expect, and what to do and not do.  If you don't have this  CD yet, buy it.  Eminem is really cool, and this CD is cool!
B000000OU0|4.0|simply outstanding C.D. It is easy to relate with the powerful words spoken on &quot;Get Over It&quot; and the amazing acoustic version of &quot;Hotel California.  Don Henley and the boys never sounded better.  I  had the great opourtunity to see Eagles back in the 1970's, and this great  C.D. brought back some great memories.  My only complaint is this: While  this is in all fairness a greatest hits compliation, why the obvious  ommision of &quot;New Kid In Town,&quot; which has some of the tightest  harmonies in the Eagles recordings.  Defenitely for both the long time fans  of the Eagles, and for the new generation who may be just now discovering  what may be one of the best harmony rock bands of the 70's.  (along with  Boston, Journey, REO Speedwagon, and Queen.)
B00003CXB6|4.0|First, Id like to talk about the movies flaws before I talk about its highpoints...<br />  The sequel to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, is over all a good movie. However there are things thrown into it that seem to lessen its  greatness.<br /> Some of these things are cheesy or plain stupid diolouge or  &quot;action sequences&quot;, they are not in the movie all of the time,  but you can tell which they are when they come up. For example that little  Gymnastic stunt to kill the Velociraptor at the end. What was that? The  ending sequence where a Tyrannosuarus Rex is causing chaos in Downtown San  Diego, even though I must admit was entertaining, didn't belong in this  film. &quot;The Lost World - Jurassic Park&quot; should have been more  closly based on the novel, in which they actualy explain, in a way that  does not contradict &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, what site B is.<br /> The films  highlights are many. The &quot;acting&quot; that the CGI dinosaurs do, in  my opinion, surpass those in the original film. Mostly becuase of the  difference in environment of Isla Sorna and Isla Nublar. More species  appear in the movie which was a nice surprise. Jeff Glodblum and Julianne  Moore were strong actors. And the bottom line is that the movie is very  entertaining, very exciting and has the perfect ending to it. <br />   I just  hope &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; which is coming out Summer 2001, will  have a more complex storyline, but still keep the realism in it as the  first two films did.
0375703764|4.0|Is the book filled with gimmicks?  Yes.  Do they overpower the story? That's more complicated. This is really two stories: The Navidson Record and Johnny Truant.  Can either of these stand alone as a good story?  The  Navidson Record can.  Truant's cannot as it is about his reaction to the  former.  While I was fascinated by the Navidson Record, Truant became a  chore.  His long monologues and gratuitous sexual encounters were at first  interesting but soon became a burden.  I skimmed a good chunk of them.  As  for the hundreds of footnotes... In the context of the narrative style of  The Navidson Record I found them to be fine.        The Navidson Record is  what would happen if Jorge Luis Borges sat down with Clive Barker to write  a novel about a haunted house.  Zampano, the fictive author of The Navidson  Record, is even an old blind man -- just like Borges.  Truant, on the other  hand, is what happens when a creative writing student tries to write an  edgy, hip horror story.  He's an L.A. partier going nowhere.  The styles  contrast too much.  It's like listening to Bach interspersed with Faster  Pussycat or any of a million other LA rock bands now confined to the $2.99  bargain bins of your local record store.  As soon as you start to get into  one it switches to the other.      Is this a great literary achievement or  is it trash? Who cares?  It's different in a genre prone to staleness.  If  its not by King, Koontz, Barker, or a handful of others -- or about  vampires -- then it probably won't get published.  Anything to crack that  narrow horror market is godsend.        Danielewski gets a A+ for research  for although many of the footnote references were fictitious many more  weren't and some of those works were obscure.

B00000ILBK|2.0|This by far, has to be the worst Star Trek Movie made, even worse than  ST5.   The one thing it did do for me though, was to increase my  appreciation for the plights of DS9 and Voyager's crews.   I mean think  about it, while the enterprise crew is entertaining diplomatic guests and  enjoying their newfound youth, DS9's crew was on the frontlines in the war  against the Dominion and Voyager's crew, perpetually alone in the Delta  quadrant, was fighting off the borg and species 84...whatever.   This  should've been a movie showing the enterprise E's prowess in battle and  involve the Federations war against the dominion.   It was almost like the  enterprise was in an alternate universe for crying out loud!!!
B00004U8P3|5.0|&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was really everything I thought it was going to be after I saw the trailer. I am very happy that they are going to release &quot;Collectors Editions&quot; of the film.<br /> This is the first movie  that Ive seen that shows dinosuars as actual animals and not monsters. It  faithfully re-creates the Prehistoric Era when dinosuars were alive. <br />  What more can I really say? Everything that was in the movie was great, all  the actors were great, it is obvious that everyone that worked on it worked  really hard.<br /> ITS JUST A REALLY GREAT MOVIE. Even though its sequel  &quot;The Lost World - Jurassic Park&quot; beat it in action, in over all  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is a lot better than its sequel.
0788821075|3.0|Hooker Vivian (JULIA ROBERTS) is picked up by wealthy but lonly businessman Edward (RICHARD GERE).  After one night of Vivian's company, Edward discovers a need for a date for a business meeting and hires her for  a week at a pay of $3000.  This has all the elements of classic fairy  tales.  A good guy (and girl) to root for, a villian to hate (Edward's  money-hungry lawyer), and fate in the middle.  Julia Robert's performance  was a rather good one because she got INTO THE MOOD of a Cinderella  doubting Prince Charming.  The movie was also nice because it revolved  around, so to speak, Roy Orbison's song, and that the song was kind of an  element there at all times just for thinking about.  There were  some--er--crude scenes and points, explaining the R rating.  Adaults who  love fairy tales will favorite this, because it's a way to dive back to  childhood and still seem grown up.
B00004RGUU|5.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid is a remarkable, and sensational film.  Redford and Newman have an amazing chemistry like no other duo.  This film has a great amount of thrilling action, and sarcastic humor.  It is a  delightful film that has an interesting, and appealing ending.  I'm sure it  wil please anybody, and everybody that owns it. <br />Katherine Ross plays a  school teacher that is beloved by two beautiful men.  Robert Redford plays  the younger male and expert gunman of the duo.  He is also Ross' beau in  the movie.  Paul Newman is the older and wiser one.  Together the two rob  trains until one robbery goes terribly wrong.  They then take Ross' along  with them away from their troubles. From there they rob banks and other  services, until their time in the sun comes to an end.<br />This movie is  fantastic!
B00004SCX6|3.0|This cd is ok, but way too much hype. I mean, 'Oops', 'Don't go knocking on my doorr', 'What u see' and 'Can't make you love me' are clones of each other. Although they are good songs it makes them so easy to get bored of.  My favourite songs are 'Lucky' (One of the best songs this millienium) and  'Stronger'. The ballads are a little too icky for me, although i like 'When  your eyes..' and 'Girl in the mirror'. I much prefer her last album,  although the songs weren't quite as strong, they were more individual and  had different types of music. I listen to it alot, but skip out some songs,  it's an average album. Christina Aguilera however, simply ROOOLLLSSS!
1577311523|5.0|+AH4-I wrote one of the early Amazon reviews for Eckhart+IBk-sbook last summer, and the book remains utterly as fresh for me todayas the first moment I opened it (thinking, oh, not another one . . .) and fell through the pages into wonder.

B000001Y2U|4.0|While industrial rock isn't my cup of burboun, this album isn't altogether half bad (literally). Some of last tracks are a little boring and the we-must-keep-70's-shock-rock-going satanism of track 99 comes off as a bit trite but Manson can write damn good lyrics and sound good at it too so I'll only shade a star from my rating.
0517591812|5.0|Splendid!  Well Done!  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  Over the past five years I have had the pleasure of living in London for several weeks each year.  This novel gave me a greater appreciation for this magnificent  city as well as the men, women, and children who built it.  As a student of  history, I have always felt that it would be fascinating to have a glimpse  into the hearts and minds of my Norman English ancesters.  In a sense, this  book gave me that opportunity.
B000005ILF|3.0|After Sting left the Police, the punk in him seemed to fade away. I'll admit that much, but to say that Sting totally lost his way musically is almost sacrilege. As SYNCHRONICITY (1983) proved, even punks need time to  grow up too, and throughout his solo career that has been Sting's goal. For  the most part, he's acheived it, but one of the rare times he went a bit  too far was his 1996 album MERCURY FALLING. The first song I heard was the  inspirational &quot;Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot&quot; which I think is  Sting's best song since leaving the Police. So when I finally listened to  the full album after 4 years of just that song, I had high hopes. Needless  to say, they were set much too high. All of Sting's previous albums had a  distinct theme, but MERCURY FALLING seems to be without much direction. The  singles that were released were expertly chosen: the Stax horns-driven  &quot;You Still Touch Me&quot; and the delightfully country-ish &quot;I'm  So Happy I Can't Stop Crying&quot;. Those are the album's biggest  highlights, and I can't say much else for the rest. Even in an age where  the one-album-every-three-years ethic prevails, MERCURY FALLING is  basically a transitional effort after the deservedly-praised TEN SUMMONER'S  TALES. Sting's latest BRAND NEW DAY is said to be an improvement, and after  winning a Grammy, I've begun to think so myself. Please anyone tell me if  that is worth buying!

In her new single 'Oops I did it again' there is a horrible section  in it when Britney charms us with her WONDERFUL acting abilities with a  horrible skit between her and an astronaut, although by just listening you  would think it was straight out of Titanic.

6300215741|5.0|What was the greatest kiss ever committed to the silver screen?  For me it comes from the Alfred Hitchcock thriller, To Catch a Thief.  Grace Kelly tempts Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief by the name of John Robie, with  her diamond necklace, to a backdrop of fireworks over the French Riviera.   Finally, having had just about enough of her tomfoolery, he says, \\"You know  as well as I do, this necklace is imitation.\\"  To which, the stunning Kelly  responds, \\"Well I'm not...\\"  <br />That is movie magic and so is this wonderful,  light-hearted and thrilling romp across the south of France as everyone  goes in search of the identity of a new jewel thief reeking havoc  throughout hotels on the French Riviera. <br />Lush cinematography, beautiful  costumes, breathtaking vistas, and delightful performances by Kelly, Grant,  and Jessie Royce Landis make this an extremely enjoyable film outing.

Ninja Scroll is evrything and more that I expected it to be. From the  stunning story to the breath taking animation. The film is almost like  seeing a epic folk tale come to life. The bits and pieces of history and  the accuracy paid to the priod are excellent. Yet this film is not for the  meek or for children. This is by far one of the more violent Animes that I  have seen.<br />Jubei is a wandering swordsman whom is a master of the sword  and a man of honor. When a dark figure from Jubies past returns Jubei is  forced into battle to prevent a plan that could very well change the course  of Japans history forever. With Kegero and Dakuan by his side Jubei must  fight the servents of darkness known as the eight devils of Kimone. <br />The  sword fights are absolutly incredible, especially when Jubei enters a  rooftop battle with the ninjas from the Shogun of the Dark. The voices are  also excellent, especially Jubei. The music is at times calm and relaxing  but can quickly turn into the music of war. The sound of swords clashing is  great. This video is a must for any anime fan and or fan of Sameria films.  Warning this film contains Strong Violence, Gore, Strong Language, Nudity,  and Rape. Suggested viewing age is 17 and up.
0345298349|5.0|i never read modern novels, much less thrillers, yet arkady renko is an absolute favourite of mine, very humane breed (extremely hard to find nowadays). the book is very intelligent and even darkly funny. as for the  reviewer who speaks about the joy and prosperity of his own society as  compared to the evil empire, i think he should 1)grow up 2)recall osborn is  an american and 3)walk (not drive) to  the next housing project with a  couple of illegal  workers from central america, and ask them about their  rights to joy and prosperity. of course, now you can see i am an idealistic  misanthrope (that's why i love renko), but don't let that keep you from  reading the book.

B00004TJLD|4.0|Obviously based on the books written by the great Russian-born novelist, Isaac Asimov, this movie should be very interesting indeed. Surprisingly few films have been made from Asimov's novels, which is rather peculiar,  since his books are still concidered to portray the ethics of robots, and  artificial intelligence in general, in the most profound manner. All we  have to do is wait how it all turns out!

B00001QEE6|5.0|Simply speaking, Lady and the Tramp is my  favorite Disney film of all time!  In my opinion, it is a 5 star masterpiece, and I would give it more if I could!  I remember when I was just 4 years old, watching the  characters Lady, Tramp, Jock, Trusty, and the Siamese Cats light up my  eyes, as well as my TV screen, as no other movie (except maybe Pete's  Dragon or Superman) has done for me before or since.  The music and songs  are  especially enjoyable, especially &quot;Bella Notte.&quot;  And the  thrilling climax (which I won't spoil for the peope who have yet to see it)   ranks with the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Lion  King&quot; climaxes!  I remember having to wait almost a decade for Disney  to re-release this classic on video so that I could replace my worn-out  taped version.  Now that I have it on both VHS and DVD, and both editions  are in widescreen, I can enjoy it for years to come as I never thought I'd  be able to!  Your kids will love it, and so will anyone who's still young  at heart!  Buy it on DVD today! Don't make the same mistake I did over 10  years ago!

Mr. Zane did a teeeeerific job as John Rolfe. Walt Disney Pictures, you've outdone yourself. Magnificent  romantic score by Lennie Niehaus. Makes me want to dance with my girlfriend  every time I watch this timeless Disney classic. Hey, that review from that  anonymous reviewer from DK is the most stupid and idiotic and profane  review I've ever read in my life!  Believe me, Billy Zane and Catherine  Zeta-Jones( my favorite actress and my baby) ARE a Terrific team.  Provides Excellent family viewing. Rated G. The BEST of the Pocahontas  movies. Darn him!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is an amazing piece of work.  I typically have pretty low expectations of films adapted from books.  A film has so much less time to tell the story and most novels tend to be pretty interior (making them hard to put on film).  The book is very much like an Elmore Leonard novel; it's  short, with lots of action and dialog.  The translation to film is amazing.   You get all the great stuff from the book, ENHANCED by the excellent  visuals and performances.  The scenes added or changed from the book (like  the scene where the main characters first meet) are just as strong as the  book.<br />There is some violence in the film, but I didn't find it unsettling  at all (there are no victims, per se, making the voilence come across more  like &quot;extreme sports&quot;).<br />This is an excellent movie.  If you  like the book, definitely see the movie.  If you like the movie, read the  book.
B00000JCOV|4.0|When i first bought the Slipknot cd back in September (by the way it was the 15 track version) i thought it was the best damn cd i ever heard. Dont get me wrong, i still think it kicks ass. But i started to get into other  bands like Cannibal Corpse and Slayer and bunch of other thrash and death  bands. I think Slipknot would sound a bit better if they added a little  death to their music. My personal favorite is Purity. And i dont know why  it isnt on this version of the cd. I also really like the hidden track  called Eyeore. Wait and Bleed is good, but i was a bit swayed when i say  the video on MTV. I always thought this band was anti-mainstream. Surfacing  has definatley gotta be the most brutal song on the album. I like it  because they say f*** alot.I would recomend this cd to anyone who is into  heavy metal with alot of screaming and cursing. Overall this is an awesome  cd. But i hope their next is better.
0790739909|4.0|Although it borrows heavily from the plot, imagery and stunning visual texture of Wim Wenders' &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, this film is a gem in it's own right. The casting of Nicolas Cage as an endearingly sad angel who  falls desperately in love with Meg Ryan's Dr. Maggie Rice was a masterful  stroke, remniscent of Cage's &quot;Moonstruck&quot; and &quot;Leaving Las  Vegas&quot; roles. Dennis Franz, playing a former angel who made the  fateful jump to mortality, displays just enough lust for life to make his  character wholly believable. Andre Braugher, as Seth's celestial cohort,  gives a wonderful performance, happy to see Seth find happiness and yet  wistful of his courage to make the decision.
B0000365JA|5.0|This album is a great one, surely a classic. If you didn't listen to Bryan before, start with this album. It's a perfect collection of his classics like Summer of 69, Everything I do(I do it for you) and many more. It also  contains the new single Best of me. But what's so special with this special  edition is the 2nd CD. It contains live recordings of Summer of 69, Back to  you, Can't stop this thing we started, Have you ever really loved a woman,  and Rock Steady. I'm sure you'll love these live recordings with perfect  quality. Specially live version of BACK TO YOU is the one every fan must  have. I strongly advice you to buy this CD. Enjoy it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I loved this CD, I listened to it almost every day. It is so funny, loud, creative and just fun. My favorites were Going Away To College, Adams Song, Dysentery Gary, Mutt, and Wendy Clear. It varies a lot in sound, and is  loud and quiet. It does swear a lot, but that is OK. I loved it to blast  really loud in my room. If you like punk rock, get this one, you'll love  it.
B00004HYC1|4.0|Duran's first outing as a 3-pc. band (except for a few tracks &quot;featuring&quot; Andy Taylor) is a marked departure from their past.  It includes funk/pop/rock.  Skin Trade shows influences of Prince.  Winter  Marches On is a very somber, reflective song.  Proposition is a very  upbeat, get out of my way song.  And of course, the title track needs no  further explanation.  I would definately recommend this CD to anyone.
6302516919|2.0|I liked the book a lot, and was excited about the movie, but it turned out to be a dissapointment. The characters were very bad and didn't really fit the part, and terrible acting. The car was still pretty cool, but they  changed so much stuff in the movie, it was kinda boring. Maybe I was  expecting too much, or maybe it was bad, but my opinion is don't get it.
630179513X|4.0|This is another really great sequel to Back To The Future. This time we pick up right after the end of Part 2 in 1955. After the Doc was accidentaly sent back to 1885 Marty must get the 1955 Doc to help him get  back to the future, 1985. Doc has burried the Delorean in an abandon cave  from 1885. But Marty finds out that Mad Dog Tannen, the Biff of the old  west murders the Doc. Marty now has to go back to 1885 with the help of  1955 Doc to save the Doc from death. Equal to Part 2, but again its missing  that comedic charm we saw in Part 1. It also has some chessy jokes. But its  still another very exciting adventure in time. I suggest you see Pats 1 and  2 first! Rated PG for language and some violence
B00003CXIP|4.0|I liked this movie a lot, not to mention the book. It is so funny and serious. It is about four 12 year old boys hiking out to see a dead body. It reminds me so much of me and my friends, I am 12. It is exactly how we act, so it was fun to watch and read. It is very funny and intense, and  just great.I Loved it and hope you do to.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City is a great television series. The show's wit, glamour and humor is incredible. I have been watching the show since its very beginning, and I am very happy that I finally have The Complete First  Season.<br />Sarah Jessica Parker is outstanding in her role of Carrie; she's  a hilarious narrator. I  love Kim Cattrall's portrayal of Samantha; she's,  without a doubt, the show's scene stealer. I also enjoy Miranda's (Cynthia  Nixon) sarcastic humor. Kristin Davis is great as Charlotte -- the romantic  one of the three. You know, I think I speak for everyone when I say that  Chris North's portrayal of Mr. Big is superb. North and Parker have great  chemistry.<br />I love this DVD collection, and my only hope is that there  will be a Complete Second Season out soon! A must-have!
B000002JOH|5.0|Not quite as melodic as C.F.H. and not quite as brutal asF.B.D., this is Pantera's best album without any weak songs. It neversounds repetitive, just check out the track list including ( ) Hostile and right after that This Love. There are no weak points on this Album, all the Songs are killers and made this record remain a classic in my CD collection. This is the must-have Pantera Album, right before Cowboys from Hell. At the Time it was released, there was no Band that played in the vain of Pantera, so this is by far their most original and impressive Album. If you consider the weak reviews on this Album, you could think of people expecting a Ballad Album, but nevermind - Metal doesn't get any harder than this.  END
0783225849|5.0|Its amazing how still to this day, a movie made 40 years ago can continue to still scare you every time you view it. But thats exactly what Psycho does. The film never has a dull moment, and all its infamous scenes are  just as startling as they were back in 1960. The story revolves around  Marion Crane, searching to leave the big city, and live the american dream,  she steals 40,000 dollars and travels to the outskirts of California. Along  the way, she starts going a little paranoid after her boss sees her leaving  the city, and she is chased by a local police officer. Overwhelmed by these  feelings and the weather, she stops at the Bates Motel. The hotel, run by  young Norman (Anthony Perkins in his finest role) has 12 open rooms. From  here, the story starts to pick up. If you have never seen any scenes from  Psycho, than the suprise you have will be amazing. There are plenty of plot  twists and edge-of-your-seat moments. Hitchcocks directing is a high note.  Just look at the scene between Marion and Norman in his parlor. The dialoug  is great, directing is great and the acting is great. A all around great  movie, and Hitchcocks best.
B000002TPS|3.0|If you liked &quot;Peace sells&quot; and &quot;So far so good so what&quot; you will put a price on Dave Mustaine's head for making this record. If &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; was rather your taste you  will love this record, for it goes in the same direction, just a little bit  less metal and more softer tunes. This isn't a bad album for people who  liked Metallica's black Album or Reload, but for the ones that got to know  Megadeth by their earlier recordings, I think it's hell. Forget about  double-bass drumming, fast guitars and riot solos, welcome chart-song  writing and MTV &quot;serious rock&quot; attitude. Don't get me wrong this  Album has it's highpoints too: Dave doesn't sing as terrible as sometimes  on the older records and there are no real weak songs like the shameful  covers of &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; or &quot;I ain't  superstitious&quot;. After some time, I got to like nearly every song on  this CD, but it isn't a milestone and it isn't worth all the puplicity done  for it. If you are looking for innovation, go elsewhere, if you are about  to open up a bar and need some music for the rush hours, get it. But don't  be fooled : This isn't a Metal CD, it lacks Attitude, Feeling and Energy.
B0000024JN|5.0|Its hard to believe. This CD is 14 years old, and is still my favorite album ever. The Beastie Boys truly deserve all the recognition they get for their music, and this amazing cd. The biggest hit on the cd, &quot;fight  for your right&quot;, is not typical beastie. Usually the rap overcomes the  beats, but for this, its more guitar bashing and them just slowly singing  along. This became the most popular Beastie song ever. Yet, even then, they  didnt succum to the power of the all mighty dollar, and crafting all songs  on the next cd just like it. (i.e. Sugar Ray and Smash Mouth) Every song on  this CD deserves to be a single. My personal favorites are &quot;rhymin and  stealin&quot; and &quot;paul revere&quot;. The CD has everything to fit  your mood, rebelion (fight for your right), love (girls), and just plain  fun (brass monkey). This is the CD the made the beastie boys huge, and it  continues, even to this day, to be the best CD they have ever made, and my  favorite CD of all time. Do yourself a favor, this CD has something for  everyone, not just rap fans, and pick this CD up.
0792839749|1.0|A gorgeous film, perfectly restored picture and good restored 5.1 sound. BUT how dare they to cut it down to full screen. The opening is letterboxed, you can read that the film is in s u p e r panavision. After  the opening the curtain closes halfway.<br />That &quot;1 star&quot; is for  the fullscreen version - should be &quot;no stars&quot;. The rest is  &quot;five stars&quot;
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin's fourth album is one of the most famous, acclaimed, and successful records ever. Following it was a mammoth task, and it is a great tribute to Houses of the Holy that it holds its own against that juggernaut. Preference between them is a matter of taste, as both are excellent, but Houses is at least as good. Indeed, though it has sold over ten million copies in the United States alone - about half as much as the fourth album -, it may well be the band's most underrated album. It is rarely, if ever, named as their best but is arguably just that. Three songs - \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" \\"The Rain Song,\\" and \\"No Quarter\\" - are among Zeppelin's best and thus the best in rock. One would be very hard-pressed to find three cuts of such quality on the same album elsewhere, especially the one-two opening punch of the first two. \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" is not far behind, and \\"The Ocean\\" is one of Zeppelin's best hard rock songs. \\"The Crunge,\\" \\"Dancing Days,\\" and \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" are significantly below aforementioned cuts but still quite good; there is simply no weak track.    The most remarkable thing about Houses it is that, where nearly any other artist would have tried to repeat the fourth album's phenomenal success by duplicating its sound, it finds Zeppelin growing and experimenting as they had been doing from the first. The blues influence that had always been paramount is greatly reduced, and we also see a substantial reduction in folk and early rock `n' roll influences. Houses truly shows Zeppelin's diversity, songwriting skills, and stellar musicianship. It is easy to see that all four members had not only changed but improved. Singer Robert Plant's lyrics, ever his weak point, are significantly improved, and he successfully uses several new vocal styles. Guitarist/producer Jimmy Page further develops his trademark layering technique and extends his acoustic playing. Bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones has the most notable and impressive change,truly coming into his own and becoming more integral than ever. He plays an unprecedented amount of keyboards and, in contrast to some later overreaching, the playing is excellent. His bass meanwhile remains as good as ever. It was hardly possible for John Bonham's drumming to improve, but he deploys several new effects as good as anything he had done. For example, he perfects a technique, previously seen in songs like \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" of coming in late but making it count. This happens on the first three cuts, where his entrances and subsequent playing are tastefully and masterfully done. It takes considerable self-control for such a powerful, active drummer to exercise such restraint, and even the best are often unable. Bonham's job here is truly admirable, and he is course great elsewhere also - not least when he does decide to be ferocious.     We can truly see Zeppelin branching out on Houses, trying a variety of styles and succeeding at all. This is clear from the very start, as the album develops a complex, multi-layered sound begun on the fourth album. It can legitimately be called progressive rock, which was then flourishing but is now mostly forgotten, even ridiculed. Zeppelin definitively proved it could more than compete with progressive artists, showing that they are more than just the pure rock they are still sometimes mysteriously dismissed as. Indeed, in marked contrast to most progressive rock, these songs are still played and enjoyed - and rightfully so. \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is a masterful example of layering; Page overdubbed an army of guitars, creating a sound that seems almost larger than life. \\"The Song\\" has some of his most incredible playing and possibly Zeppelin's best intro, which is quite saying something. The song was in fact conceived as an instrumental intro to \\"The Rain Song,\\" but singer Robert Plant added lyrics that are among his best, sung in an impressively stratospheric register. The cut also has some of Jones' best bass playing, and Bonham's drumming is great as always.     Showing its origin, the first track segues into \\"The Rain Song,\\" which I sometimes think may be the band's greatest work. A lovely piece of near-inexpressible beauty, it was inspired by George Harrison's comment that Zeppelin never wrote ballads. They more than make up for it here; this is nothing less than one of the greatest ballads in all rock. Plant is of course a big part; his words are endearing and quite good, and his vocals vary from passionate whispering to highly emotional wailing. However, the music is the real star. Page shows off some of his most tasteful and beautiful acoustic playing, and Jones' mellotron is incredible; the combination is nothing less than sublime. As ever, Bonham comes in at exactly the right time, his subtle yet powerful drums making the song, against all odds, even better. When Page asked Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry if he would induct Zeppelin into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he agreed on one condition - that Page would teach him \\"The Rain Song.\\" It is easy to see why.    \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" has the best acoustic intro in Zeppelin, possibly in all of rock. Page's layering is again amazing and shows unexpected reach by creating a dramatic mood. The song eventually turns into an all-out rocker, perfecting the trick of starting with a lovely acoustic intro and then moving into crushing electric guitar. Many bands have done it since - Rush, Metallica, etc. -, often in imitation, but it has perhaps never been done as well. Zeppelin succeeds where others fail by not making the intro short and perfunctory or the electric crush overly dramatic. Page has a superb electric solo as well, and the bass is great. The ending is also notable, returning to the intro in spirit but mixing chiming electric guitar with mellotron.    \\"The Crunge\\" is the album's least good song but notable for delving into funk. Much derided on release, this loving James Brown tribute has come to be appreciated as an interesting experiment and fun in itself. Page's riff is very catchy, and Bonham's interplay is truly a feast to hear; the band apparently agreed, often breaking into it in jams. Jones' synthesizer is also important, beating out a funky riff without being overbearing as the instrument all too often is. Brown fans will appreciate the references to his music.    \\"Dancing Days\\" comes closer than anything on the album to straight rock/pop and, while paling beside the masterworks, is very good on these terms. The music and general mood are infectious and, while Plant's atrocious lyrical penchant unfortunately returns, it is a very fun song. As the title implies, it seems tailor-made for dancing, and one could hardly hope for more on this front.    \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" is another experimental track, showing a heavy reggae influence along with a bit of a return to early rock `n' roll. It baffled initial critics but has come to be one of Zeppelin's most played songs. The drumming is absolutely incredible from the intro to the end - some of Bonham's very best playing. The song would be worthwhile for this alone, but there is even more. Page has some tasty guitar bits, and the ending's little piano touches are exquisite. The vocal melody is very catchy, making this easy to sing along to, but these may be Plant's worst lyrics of all - nay, some of the worst ever by anyone. They are so bad that even making them up on the spot would not excuse them; it almost seems like a joke, even a self-parody. While true that the song is not meant to be serious in the strictest sense, meaning we should perhaps not judge them too harshly, they are simply too bad to be acceptable on an official release by a major artist. However, they thankfully do not ruin the song, which is otherwise quite good, even if decades of being overplayed on the radio have cut into my enjoyment somewhat.    \\"No Quarter\\" is Jones' masterpiece - great enough to show his talent is on Page's level. This isanother progressive rock song and a masterwork of mood. A dark, atmospheric piece, its brooding overtones of foreboding and dread convey the horrors of war so strongly that lyrics are superfluous - though Plant's words are actually among his best, making up for the prior cut to a certain degree. Jones' playing on both acoustic and electric piano is exquisite, and his bass pedals keep a steady rhythm going. Bonham helps here as always, and Page, while not the star, inserts some very tasteful playing. Plant's singing is also very good, skillfully complementing the music with subtly alternating light and shade.    This great album ends with \\"The Ocean,\\" which returns to more traditional territory. A guitar-led behemoth, it has one of Page's best riffs and absolutely ferocious drumming. This would be more than enough, but there are other touches; the band just seemed too far along to return to the straight-up hard rock that initially dominated its sound. \\"The Ocean\\" slows down significantly near the middle and again at the end, coming to a dramatic standstill with an a cappella section and doo wop-influenced bits. The band kicks back into gear again after the first pause, as on \\"Over the Hills,\\" then song and album come to a successful close after another pause and a fiery guitar solo.    All told, this is one of the greatest albums in rock history, and no one should be without it. \\"Holy\\" is truly not too strong a word for it, which may be all that needs to be said.
014017821X|5.0|Rich writing and evocative imagery bring this collection of short stories into a magical realm all its own.<br />Tales like Beauty and the Beast, Bluebeard, and others are virtually engorged by Carter with heat, poetry,  and imagination.  It's great writing!<br />Good gift for your favorite vampire  fanatic, a favorite with college students.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is perhaps not the best Zeppelin album but is definitely the most experimental and diverse. Nearly everything that that Zeppelin was made of is here:  straight-ahead rock (\\"Custard Pie\\"), epics (\\"Kashmir,\\" \\"In the  Light,\\" \\"In My Time of Dying\\"), folkish tunes (\\"Black Country Woman\\"), and 1950s influences (\\"Boogie with Stu.\\") The only thing really missing is straight-up blues. Still, that is nothing to complain about; this  album is great. I and many other fans agree that \\"Kashmir\\" is the band's  best song. \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" and \\"In My Time of Dying\\" are great also. This is a must own.
0451524985|5.0|I didn't find this novel perverted at all.  I think the underlying depiction of human sexuality was just but eye-opening honest and fundamentally beautiful, as opossed to so many hypocritical, really  perverted, or really prejudiced points of view about sexuality that  populate our cultures and societies.  I really wish I had read this book  when I was 15.  In my opinion very few writers can be as honest, frank, and  genuine about sexuality as Lawrence is.  This is the first of Lawrence's  books I read, and am planning to read many of his books now.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin has, of course, many great albums, but I'd have to say that this one (or the mighty Untitled) is their undisputed best. The track list practically reads like a Zeppelin &quot;best of&quot; list: Whole Lotta  Love, What Is..., Thank You, Heartbreaker, Moby Dick, etc., but they are  all great. Bring It On Home is the only song that isn't an absolute  masterpiece. This is a classic.
B00004T1HK|1.0|This has to be the worst CD I ever listened to!  Someone in my family bought this CD and was nice enough to let me take a listen.  It hurt my head!  Like her first CD, there is too much of something.  Unlike her last  Cd, which had nothing to make me want to dance, this has too much hard  edge!  Britney, you may have shot to the top, but try something else!  There's more then your soda-pop and rock n' roll image.  Belive me, this CD  is not a number 1 in my book.  Maybe next time, but for now, this is a real  OOPS, SHE'S DONE IT AGAIN!
B000002JSJ|4.0|This is NOT the best Zep album, but it's one that fans of the band will like nonetheless. This (along with it's precedessor, Physical Graffiti) is where Led Zeppelin veers close to progressive rock territory. Achilles Last  Stand in particular is great (by far the album's best song) where Page  builds layer upon layer of monstrous &quot;wall of sound&quot; guitars,  Jones lays down a killer bass line, and Bonzo joins Jimmy for some killer  drum/guitar riffage. A masterpiece of an opener. However, it is nearly  impossible to follow. The next track, For Your Life is a pretty good song,  but nothing to match Achilles. Nobody's Fault But Mine is another fairly  complex song, and it is a great one. Tea For One is a nice slow blues and  is probably the band's most underrated song. The rest of the songs aren't  that good though. Get this if you already own the band's masterpieces  (I,II,IV,Houses,etc.).
0800141326|3.0|Godzilla is no more than an overblown no-brainer. It does have impressive special effects,but nothing else. The acting isn't among the greatest and it gets more predictable as it goes along. Almost to the point of being  unintentionally hilarious.
B000002J09|5.0|This is unquestionably one of the finest albums of all-time, whether listened to as a whole (preferable) or in bits and pieces. It's up there with such high ranking albums as Aerosmith's Toys In The Attic, Pink  Floyd's Wish You Were Here, and Rush's Moving Pictures.<br />Everyone knows  that Stairway To Heaven is one of the best songs ever, but it's hardly the  album's lone highlight. Rather, songs like Black Dog, Misty Mountain Hop,  Rock and Roll, and When The Leevee Breaks are also classics. I am baffled  by the bad reviews of this album. How can you not like it? I guess you have  to be deaf.
B000009ED0|4.0|Hip Hop and rock are not two genres of music that necessarily belong together, but can be effective if done well.  Kid Rock does, in fact, do a reasonably good job of merging the two in his breakthrough (though NOT his  first, as someone else claimed) album.<br />If you're looking for  awe-inspiring MCing or mind-blowing rock 'n roll, you'll be dissappointed.   Devil Without a Cause is an unabashed celebration of hedonism, and not much  else.  There are a couple of tracks that have real lyrical substance, but  those are definitely exceptions.  Sonically, this is ear candy- that is,  fun to jam out to, but not anything that will leave you convinced that rock  'n roll is being taken to new heights.<br />With these points in mind, this is  still a thoroughly enjoyable album.  As party albums go, this is excellent.   Kid Rock doesn't pretend to be anything greater than he is, and I find  that refreshing.  Overall, he is a solid producer, a pretty good singer  when he wants to be, and his rap lyrics, though certainly not on par with  the great lyricists of Hip Hop, do put a smile on my face.  I still listen  to this when I want to to turn my brain off and chill out after a long day.   If you think of Devil Without a Cause in those terms, you will understand  its merits.
B000002JSP|5.0|I personally feel that this is one of Zeppelin's best albums. Definately different from their other releaes, this is the album where John Paul Jones came into his own. In The Evening and I'm Gonna Crawl are good songs, but  All My Love and Fool In The Rain are masterpieces, two of their best ever  tracks. The synth-drenched Carouselambra is a good song also. Some of the  other tracks are near filler, but those songs more than hold their own.
B000002L5P|5.0|The Smiths broke onto the scene in 1984 with this thought-provoking album. 16 Years later, the music is still powerful, the themes still poignant.<br />From this album, there are at least 5 songs that find  themselves onto most Smith's greatest hits compilations (Reel around the  Fountain, This Charming Man, Still Ill, Hand in Glove, and What difference  does it Make?), so right there that's got to tell you that folks who like  the Smiths have a pretty high regard for this album.<br />Personally, I  enjoyed the lesser-known ones on this. &quot;The Hand that Rocks the  Cradle&quot; is one of the most haunting ballads I've ever heard.  &quot;Pretty Girls Make Graves&quot; shows Morrissey's delicate side as  well as his loathing for those who try for the &quot;quick and easy  way.&quot; &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot; is the sad story of brutal  child murders in Manchester. Morrissey and Co. give a very appropriate  eulogy to these poor children.<br />Don't get the idea that this album is all  a downer. There are plenty of upbeat songs and ones where Morrissey's  subtle humor shines through. At some points the Smiths sound like the raw  band that they were at that time. At other times, you'd think that they'd  had been together for years since the music is so polished.<br />This probably  isn't the first Smith's album to get if you're new to them because of the  serious themes dealt with here. However, if you've heard something like  &quot;Smith's The Singles&quot; or &quot;Best of...&quot; and are looking  for something even deeper, this is the place to go.
B000002ITG|5.0|The great volume of excellent music (and interviews) on this box obliges me to give a five-star rating. However, it does not really define Led Zeppelin. They were always an album band and not served well by  such compilations. If you are just getting into the band, you should  either buy the albums or the far more comprehensive Boxed Set I and II.
B000006NX5|5.0|Barry White Creates a Great Album Here.His Trademark Strings.His Arrangements alone are Genius.This Album Like So Much Of His Work is Incredible.the way He Uses Instruments&amp;Grooves.that's part of the Rich  Legacy that is Barry White.Very Essential Music From this Musical  Genius.The Way He Hears Things in His Music is Incredible.
B000002JSR|3.0|This is not really a bad album, but it doesn't stand up to the band's other releases. You shouldn't really expect it too, it is merely a collection of leftover tracks thrown together without any feeling of  cohesiveness to it. And yet, knowing that, it is still hard not to be  disappointed by it.<br />We're Gonna Groove is a great song, a nice uptempo  number. Bonzo's Montreaux is good, although it's no Moby Dick. The version  of I Can't Quit You Baby is good also. However, all the rest of the songs  on here that I didn't mention aren't very good, at least not for Zeppelin.  Buy this only if you have all their other albums (including BBC Sessions)  and you still want more.
6303433766|4.0|Christchurch, New Zealand, 1952: two school girls become friends and swoon over Mario Lanza, \\"world's greatest tenor,\\" as they create a fantasy world of royalty and intense emotional attachment to one another.  This is teen  escapism carried to the nth degree.  Innocence and wholesome fun do NOT  prevail.  As the parents grow increasingly concerned about their daughters'  obsessive relationship, the girls begin to hate the parents...  Based on a  rather shocking (for its time) true story.<br />Kate Winslet made her film  debut in this modest com&eacute;die noire from way down under.  It is amazing to  realize that three years later she starred in the Academy Award winning  Titanic (1997), on her way to establishing herself as one of the most  charismatic and talented stars of the past decade.  In retrospect, her  budding talent is apparent here as the spinning, laughing, crazy teen who  went off the deep end emotionally.  There is no mistaking the sharp,  confident and commanding Winslet style.  Despite the part, Kate looks as  wholesome and delicious as apple pie with cherry vanilla ice cream, yet  manages to convey the demented edge necessary to the role.<br />Full-figured  and brooding Melanie Lynskey is intriguing and not easily forgotten as  Kate's manic/depressive friend.<br />Director Peter Jackson is to be  commended for getting the most out of the girls, and for making their  fantasy world believable.  We can imagine how they fell into it.
B00004U30D|5.0|American Beauty may be too dark to go down as one of the all-time classic movies, but it certainly is a masterpiece of cinema.  Every performance was perfect, every role perfectly cast, every deadpan joke worked  perfectly.<br />This movie is not for everyone.  It deals with some very adult  and very touchy issues (adultery, homosexuality and homophobia, dirty old  men)and most people I know either loved it or hated it.  There is very  little room for any middle ground.<br />American Beauty deserved every Oscar  it won, plus about a dozen others it didn't- Annette Benning, Thora Birch,  and Mena Suvari were all wonderful, as were several other actors whose  names escape me.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|What makes an album a 'classic'?<br />1. Wall-to-wall good songs.  Got that covered.  From the bookend &quot;hits&quot; London Calling and Train in Vain (classics both), to such great middle-of-disc tunes like Rudie Can't  Fail, Lost in the Supermarket, and Koka Kola, every cut makes my head  spin.<br />2.  Performance.  The boys have both intense sincerity in their  playing, and a willingness to mix styles.  And anyone who says Joe Strummer  has a 'weak' voice should stick to soulless technical singers like Celine  Dion.<br />3.  Longevity.  Released in 1980 and only discovered by my ears  last year, it dwarfs everything else in its path.  The rebellion that I  usually find empty in other punk bands of its era is not a problem here.   Still relevant, I'd say.<br />I guess it fits the 'classic' label like a  glove, then.
B00002Z88D|5.0|When I was first told that Metallica had an album with the Symphony Orchestra,  I didn't believe it.  I listened to it, I admit, being a little hesitant.  I am so glad I did though, now this album is the one I take with  me everywhere.  I even got my aunt listening to them.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink is definitely one of the most talented young musicians out there- her voice is incredible; her range soars to first soprano, then plunges to tenor...it is utterly beautiful and heartfelt throughout this great debut  album. I sincerely like all the songs on this album, but I must say that my  favorites are &quot;Split Personality,&quot; &quot;Hell Wit Ya,&quot;  &quot;MOST GIRLS,&quot; &quot;Stop Falling,&quot; and &quot;Is It  Love.&quot; However, this is not an album to just sit down and listen to-  this is an album to get up and sing and dance to. I do have one gripe about  it, though- the lyrics were not included in the cd, and sometimes Pink  sings fast...It can be tough to follow along, but luckily she enunciates  and you can tell what she's singing (or saying) most of the time. I bought  this album for &quot;There You Go&quot; and, as I knew, there ended up  being better songs on it. If you like &quot;There You Go&quot; in the  least, or even Pink's voice, then I strongly suggest you get this album.  Pink sounds a bit like Mariah Carey, but her songs are edgier, and I  wouldn't have it any other way. I'm sure you'll agree, this girl is amazing  and I wish her the best.
B00002Z88D|5.0|When I was first told that Metallica had an album with the Symphony Orchestra,  I didn't believe it.  I listened to it, I admit, being a little hesitant.  I am so glad I did though, now this album is the one I take with  me everywhere.  I even got my aunt listening to them.
0783229100|5.0|This is the second time George Roy Hill made movie magic (not to mention box office cash) by teaming Robert Redford and Paul Newman. Lots of aspects about this movie have become screen cliches and the score is one of the  most memorable of all time. But the ingenious plot twists are the ones that  leave the impact and leave the viewer with a big smile on his/her face and  wanting to return for more. The screenplay itself is buy-the-book creating  amusing situation, likable characters and a big wallop of an ending. Sure,  it follows the formula, but we don't even care, we get such a thrill out of  watching Redford and Newman in action that we forget about everything else.  It also wouldn't of worked so well if it wasn't for the high quality  supporting cast (kudos go to Robert Shaw), and the high production values.  This is a movie that asks for repeated viewings, and it's just a flat-out  good time. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!
B00004T9UF|5.0|Although controversy abounds the white rapper eminem/slim shady, he and his producer Dr. Dre have once again crafted an album that not only thumps hard on tracks like &quot;Kill You&quot; and &quot;Drug Ballad&quot; but manages to create strong mental pictures best displayed by  &quot;Stan&quot;.  While the rest of the industry continues to pump out  money/( )/( ) jams, Eminem is a nice change from the the standard hip  hop fair.
B0000027I6|5.0|This cd is great, any Pink Floyd fan should love it, and if they don't, I would seriously doubt that they are PK fans. Waters has a unique voice.  This means that not everyone will find it a good one, but at least it is  something that stands out and is interesting (unlike Gilmour).  For those  that keep saying that Waters can't carry a tune, you are wrong.  You must  be the ones that are tone deaf, because he can carry a tune.  Most likely  you are just saying this because you don't like the way he sings.   Different people have different tastes, and to say that this cd is bad just  because you don't like the way Waters sings on it (which is not much  different than the way he sings with PK)is stupid.  Without Waters voice in  PK, the band would have sounded just like any other popular english rock  band.  Gilmour has a good voice, but one that isn't very interesting. It  was Water's voice that made PK stand out.
B00000IPAX|2.0|Some of the songs are great and the songs anthem and mutt alonemake this CD worth buying but it also has plenty of pop ( ) likewhat's my age again, All the small thing and the annoying adam's song which is more like pearl jam's last kiss than i can take. ( ) END
B0000000LI|5.0|If I had to pick 10 CD's that were the very essence of passion this would be one of the top picks!<br />I saw Yanni first playing live on TV as I was &quot;channel surfing&quot; and I was frozen in my seat, completely  entralled by his passion and originality.  I went straight out the next day  and bought this CD. Rarely does any music reach out and Grab my heart the  way Yanni does; oh if everything were as romantic and passionate as his  music!<br />My personal favorites are: 1 ONE MAN'S DREAM 2 REFLECTIONS OF  PASSION 3 UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT 4 NOSTALGIA and  5 THE RAIN MUST  FALL.<br />Whether you are a hopeless romantic, or a firey aggressive person  this is the music for you!<br />I whole-heartedly recommend Yanni's music for  the entire world! There is so much beauty. No words are needed.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is one of those pieces of work that creators do that ordinarily doesn't get much attention or is not generally like by the critics, in this case it was both when it first was viewed.  But fortunately as the years  have gone by the genius of Walt Disney lives through this great work of  wonderful artists and a wonderful imagination.  We soon, I hope, to have  the new Fantasia 2000 later this year or next and hopefully will have the  same respect as the original.
B000004166|5.0|This set is certainly the best available actually even if it is recorded in the sixties: this confirms the interpretation value and touch by Grumiaux: being associated with Colin Davis at the head of the LSO can be  only a winner! Grumiaux is an aristocrat of the violin and its perception  value, sound deployed, musicality have not lost a single gram after the  years. It is certainly better than the Perlman association with Levine (of  course a personnel opinion, refer a previous judgment about it...) and if  there is a choice to do, this set is the one to catch before it is too  late! Version of Mozart Concerto by Cho-Liang Lin is the alternative to  listen. This present set is complete, the number Five is at the top, you  have also an Adagio &amp; Rondo with different cadenza reviewed by Mozart  following  critics at the time he composed. For the rest there is nothing  to add to the excellent &amp; positive remarks by other reviewers  about  this excellent Duo Set by Philips and no hesitation for this outstanding  reference version. The quality of the sound is also excellent.
B00003CWL6|5.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; exudes so much truth, it's head-turningly  elemental.  Taking what seems to be a drab storyline, the pace and the  approach surprise the audience; we are always with the characters when they  complain about their lives, and we are always with them when they laugh and  smile about their past experiences.  The actors are across-the-cast superb,  especially Kevin Spacey, who makes it seem impossible that Lester Burnham  be played by anyone but him.  While I personally did think that  &quot;American Beauty&quot; was a little overrated (I still haven't figured  out whether it really IS the best of the decade), and it's true that the  Colonel 's role seems only to propel the last act of the movie, that  doesn't change its magic.  It 's an incredily insightful and intelligent  exploration of our daily natures,  and the movie is boundless in nuance and  meaning.  Top it off with an affecting  music score by Thomas Newman (who's  FINALLY getting recognized), and sweeping cinematography, and you get one  of the top picks of 1999.
B00000JCB2|1.0|ok people, yes i like limp bizkit. yes i gave it one star. i like OLD limp bizkit, like three dollar bill y'all. but this significant other stuff...i will say that (for a time) it was good. it was pretty good accually, the thing is, when sig. other was released, everyone was expecting a  hardcore-rap album, like three dollar bill yall, then when the hit  &quot;nookie&quot; was released, i thought it was awsome, but it got old,  and then otehr hits were released, like &quot;break stuff&quot; and &quot;n  2-gether now&quot;. break stuff is a decent song, but the good stuff , if  there is any, are songs like 9 teen ninty 9 and trust? i think are the best  stuff. re-arranged was ok, it showed a more mature side to limp bizkit, but  who would want a more mature side? this album is [money] down the drain, i  bought it, listened to it, then sold it....   it's not worth it....

6305558167|5.0|In my opinion this film is unique. It follows Thomas Mallory's &quot;Le Morte D'Arthur&quot; fairly accurately. This is something rarely achieved by other films focused on the genre. The casting is excellent, Nigel Terry  portrays both the naive boyish Arthur and the elder statesman with great  panachi. Helen Mirren makes for a convincingly evil Morgan Le Faye whilst  the gorgeous Cheri Lunghi shines as Arthur's bride. Lancelot is convincing  as he struggles with divided loyalties but the main credit for the film's  success must surely go to Nicol Williamson as Merlin. The film attempts to  portray a dark period of British history and this is convincingly portrayed  in the atmosphere, costume and make up of the actors but by adopting a  light hearted portrayal of a serious character, he manages to balance just  the right amount of comic relief. Towards the film's conclusion the charge  of the knights through the orchard to the sound of a choir singing the  &quot;Carmen Burmina&quot; has to be one of the high points of British  cinema.
0783225733|5.0|&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is, quite simply, one of the most exciting and moving Hollywood films of the entire decade of the 1990s. Not only does the film seem utterly real in its recreation of NASA and space exploration; it  also gives us breathless, second-by-second suspense and real characters to  care about, played by some of the best actors Hollywood has to offer. Ron  Howard should have won the Best Director Oscar for this film; that he  wasn't even nominated will remain one of the greatest black marks against  the Academy in its entire history. (At least the Directors' Guild didn't  slip up, and gave Howard its award that year.)
1882723007|5.0|In telling her story, she came across as vulnerable and sincere.  From the time I picked-up the book I couldn't put it down. I sobbed through the last two chapers because of her courage and the power of her story.
6305807086|5.0|Being John Malkovich casts a spell of enchantment over its viewers by creating its own wacky world, with its completely strange characters and out-of-kilter rules, and then remaining absolutely true to that world. You  get a big, wonderful surprise every five minutes; the &quot;Malkovich  Malkovich Malkovich&quot; scene alone is worth the price of a rental! John  Malkovich himself was robbed when he didn't get a Best Actor or Supporting  Actor nomination, but considering the sheer glorious weirdness of this  movie, I must bow to the Academy for breaking its usual bonds and actually  giving this film nominations for Best Director, Screenplay and Supporting  Actress. If you're adventurous at all in your moviegoing tastes, this movie  is for you.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Besides being one of the most popular cult movies of all time, the Rocky Horror Picture Show provides hours of entertainment with the characters you want to be and the places you want to go! Perfect for parties, Halloween,  or at home by yourself. Awesome movie. Great conversation starter with  friends. Never will regret it.I haven't.
6300247120|5.0|This movie came out of nowhere in 1979 to win a Best Original Screenplay Oscar and four other nominations. It had no big names in the cast (though two of the actors, Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern, went on to great  success), no fanfare, nothing but its own buoyant, joyous spirit to  recommend it to viewers. It is a beautiful, funny film, and one with a  wholesome moral about the need to persevere in life and to hold fast to  your dreams. The language might be a little gamy for the Christian  Coalition, but the moral of the film is entirely in line with Middle  America. Paul Dooley gives a perfect performance in this film; why he  didn't get an Oscar nomination is utterly beyond me, and I wish both he and  Dennis Christopher would have had better careers than they did. But they'll  always have &quot;Breaking Away,&quot; and that in itself is glorious.

B000000WHX|5.0|Massive Attack's debut remains one of the most important albums of the 90's and it's release was instrumental in proving to people that dance music and hip hop could be intelligent. Today, 10 years on, it's beauty and  brilliance remains  undimmed. The lazy but thumping scene is set with 'Safe  from Harm', which is built around a groovy bassline and features Shara  Nelson's soulful voice and 3d's mysterious raps. The best track is 'One  Love', featuring the wonderful voice of Horace Andy. The album veers  between soul and hip hop, but when we reach 'Unfinished Sympathy', there is  no doubt that TripHop has been born. The albums most famous track, and  probably the one which Massive Attack will carry with them until they die,  it uses a full orchesta and fuses those lush sounds with Shara Nelson's sad  vocals and the  hip hop breakbeats and loops that Massive Attack had  perfected under The Wild Bunch. 'Unfinished Sympathy' really is a very  special song, and its influence can be seen everywhere today, from rock  groups like The Verve and Radiohead to much of modern dance music,  particularly the ambient scene. This is an album that anybody with an  interest in music history should own, or indeed anyone who just likes to  relax to some good vibes. You won't be disappointed.
014028009X|4.0|When I finished the book, I sat back with a sigh and almost started to feel disappointed. I had spent two hours reading.. just this? Why did I bother? But then I realized that Bridget Jones' Diary was all it claimed to  be - a lighthearted, comical, sketch of a fictional British girl's life. I  was taken through her trials at work, fiascos in love and dinner parties,  problems with her mother, and everyday battles with her personal vices  (smoking, calories, etc). More importantly though, and the reason I was not  disappointed, is that the book made me laugh out loud multiple times.  The  author's ability to make her reader laugh is what makes the book so popular  despite the critics' not so favorable reviews. Anyone who enjoys a good  giggle will get a guffaw out of this great summer read.
0767817486|5.0|Alan Parker's Midnight Express was created in 1978. This movie is a real masterpiece, dedicated to the human will. It is based in a real story, the story of Billy Hayes, a young american boy who, during his vacation with  his girlfriend, is being arrested in Turkey for drugs. Finally he was  condemned in many years imprisonment but the worst of all is the violence  that he and his friends live in the turkish prisons... Our hero at the end  of the story succeeds in escaping after an endless suffering... The movie  shows in the best way the encroachment of the human rights by Turks, one of  the greatest problems in Turkey that even in these days hasn't stopped at  all. The film is, totally, an excellent result. Brad Davis (Billy Hays) has  the best role of his short life (he died some years before of AIDS). Alan  Parker's direction and Oliver Stone's script are unique as well as the  soundtrack created by Giorgio Moroder (who composed many other great  soundtracks, including the one of Electric Dreams). The whole movie is very  touching and I suggest it to everyone, even to Turks because I believe it  could be a good lesson for them.
0930289528|5.0|Naturally the inclination is to disbelieve in the power of the comic-book format to tell a socially relevant and emotionally powerful story, and most of the genre is cluttered with nihilistic power fantasies these days.  But  this is a brilliant exception, and that can be attributed to Alan Moore's  powers as a writer.<br />You can read the rest of the reviews and find a lot  of spoiling detail about the narrative, but the best aspect lies in an  attention to the small and overlooked people whose feelings Alan Moore  makes very much a part of the entirety.  In what I think is the best moment  of all, one of the characters imprisoned by the secret police of the  English totalitarian state reads and envisions the final thoughts of a dead  lesbian, written on toilet paper for some future prisoner to draw hope  from.  I felt an almost tearful admiration for the sort of bravery and  faith in oneself that this prisoner discovers, and a more conscious  recognition that Alan Moore is one of the best ever to write for the  medium.<br />It's indisputably good, but it thumps the pulpit of the author's  choosing - all government steals self-determination and liberty from its  subjects, civilization and barbarism are close neighbors, the masses remain  wilfully ignorant of the big picture to focus on television fantasies.   It's a deliberately simple portrait of a dystopia, and its questions demand  thought from their readers. You might love this as much as I do, but rest  assured it won't be because of simplicity or polite avoidance of  libertarian doctrine.
0312954468|3.0|This book does hold your attention, it has lots of action and excitement, even if it was sort of predictable. If you like reading adventures stories about talented, beautiful people as heroes, with clear cut good guys and  bad guys, then this book is for you. I had a lot of trouble relating to all  of the characters, and Taita's relationship with Lostris really seemed like  the only relationship that held any reality for me. Taita was immensely  talented for a slave, and he lets you know it every other paragraph,  between talking about his beauty and worrying about his figure. But I'm  complaining a lot. All in all this book was an exciting adventure story.
6305558167|5.0|This film is a wonderful portrayal of the most popular version of the King Arthur legend. The characters are reliable and definitely believable. I personally liked the way they portrayed the romance between Arthur and  Guenivere. It showed the love and respect between them while still showing  cause for her betrayal. They didn't portray her as a harlot just a woman  who made a mistake and later tried to repent for it. I highly recommend  this movie to anyone, but most definitely to any Arthurian Gurus out there.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is clearly one of the greatest novels ever written in the history of mankind.  Herbert's sheer brilliance and excellent writing style make for a treat.  I felt for the characters, Paul Muad'Dib seemed like a true hero,  and I loathed the Harkonnens.  The character development is excellent, and  the plot is truly captivating.  I found myself turning pages very quickly.   A complex epic with Politics,  philosophy, ecology, etc.. all are presented  in this great book.  I recommend it to anybody who is literate and has a  decent attention span. (you'll find yourself wanting to read all six  books.)  Definately check this one out.
B00004SST6|3.0|Its a Sunday, MY day of rest and this particluar Sunday following a very long hard working Saturday where I was working as a festival organizer. I had Jazz playing from one of the Jazz music audio channels off Dish Network  Satalite. And I heard this booming sound! <br />I was in a deep sleep and  was dreaming some music only this music picked me up out of my deep sleep  and grabbed my attention! I had to grab the remote, turn on the television  to read the display and find out what song was playing. I already knew it  was George!, but I had to get the details. The song was El Barrio! <br />One  song so damn good and &quot;Absolute&quot; pure, without a doubt powerful  BENSON, that as far as I am concerned, SOLD!  And I am out my door within  minutes and getting this CD. It is a MUST have not only if you are a Benson  fan, or a music fan! <br />Thanks Amazon.com for offering ALL of the sound  clips. If my local store in the MALL (I live in a small town) does not have  this, I will order it from here ASAP. But I'll pay the Mall prices for this  one. And those who know me know thats me saying a lot for any CD that I  buy.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminems last LP &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; really showedeveryone what he was capable of and, although surrounded by badreviews and controversy, it still did very well. His new album is equally as good, but maybe lacking in the originality department. <br />It kicks off with the new Public Service Announcement which basically makes a joke of the last PSA. Then theres &quot;Kill You&quot;, which is a fantastic track to kick the album off, and really sets the atmosphere up. Then theres &quot;Stan&quot;, where Eminem talks about a fan who killed himself over em's songs. This is arguably the best track on the album, and is definetly worth a buying the album for.  Then theres another call from Em's agent &quot;Paul&quot;, nothing new here. Then theres a second song about a fan who took em's music a little too seriously. This isn't as good as Stan but its still pretty cool. Then theres a conversation between Em and his producer &quot;Steve&quot;. This is quite funny. Then you've got &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, which is another great track thats worth a listen. Em says how people react to him and he doesn't give a ( ). Then theres the single from the LP, &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;. This is probebly the happiest and most fun track on the album with plenty of Limp Bizkit/Christina Aguilera gags thrown in for good measure (watch the video because it Rocks! ). Then theres &quot;Remember me&quot;, which is very similar to last years &quot;Just don't give a F**k&quot;. Next up is &quot;I'm Back&quot;, another song where Em takes on his &quot;Slim Shady&quot; persona. Quite good, but again pretty un-original as it sounds a lot like some of the stuff we've heard before.  Then theres my favourite song on the album titled &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;. Its got quite a slow beat to it and Em talks about how success has effected him. Very Cool. Then we hear Ken Kaniff instructing &quot;Shaggy&quot; and &quot;Jay&quot; what to do with his genatalia. This is as hilarious as the first time we heard from Ken in &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (just don't play it infront of your mum and dad!). Then theres the &quot;Drug Ballad&quot;. This track is very similar to 1999's &quot;Cum on Everybody&quot; in its layout. Its an ok track,but again, not to original.  Next up is &quot;Amityville&quot;. Quite good, but still not too original.  Next is DrDre and SnoopDog's &quot;Bitch Please II&quot;. Its pretty good, but also pretty poor for Dre. Next we find out how em's wife ended up in the trunk of the car in 1999's &quot;97' Bonne and Clyde&quot;. Its ok, but its pretty nasty. Its one of those songs where em puts the language and nastyness on overload, but its still pretty good. The next track, &quot;Under the Influence&quot; is rather good, but again the style and the beat are pretty un-original. Finally theres &quot;Criminal&quot;, that starts off the same way as 1999's &quot;Still don't give a f**k&quot;. Its pretty damn good, but i don't think it was the best track to end the album with.<br />So, if you like Em, and you've heard his last album, then you'll adore this. If your just getting into Em, get his first album first. If you don't like language or nasty lyrics, then stay well away. I loved it, so, get it! But don't expect anything completly original END

0385495315|5.0|This is the most interesting book that I have read  so far this year.  One does not have to be a mathematician, puzzler, or techie to enjoy this book.  It is written as a fascinating history of the evolution of code, from  hieroglyphics to the future.  After reading this, I read Singh's earlier  book, Fermat's Enigma, another stimulating read.  Again, a history rather  than a math book, it is written for Anyone.
B00000JCOV|5.0|When I first started to hear slipknot, I was thinking this is some sort of scarey stuff. But I love it.<br />Corey has the perfect vocals for screaming. The guitarists are just insane and talented. The sound samples and turn  tables just blow up the spot. <br />With masks and a angry mosh-making sound,  you can't go wrong. I've seen one of their videos. They put on &quot;THE  SHOW&quot; fighting eachother on stage. Always running around causing  havoc. These guys will be my favorite hardcore musicians EVER.<br />They have  a theme of destruction and &quot;I don't care about anything.&quot; I think  that slipknot came to give the industry a head-ache, probably because they  were tired of all the lame, untalented bands just trying to make a speck of  what they produce. My favorite song &quot;WAIT AND BLEED&quot; is great,  because Corey's vocals go from semi-soft to all-out rage. If you're a  hardcore fan or just like talented, good music then consider this for your  music collection.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|After years of hard work and effort, the boys from Brisbane Australia were introduced to the world with their multi-platinum debut album.  With a number 1 hit in America, they fast became Australia's biggest musical  export, and they're about to do it all over again with their latest album  titled 'Affirmation'. <br />Boasting a second number 1 single in America with  'I Knew I Love You', Savage Garden are now the first Australian band since  Men At Work in the 80's to score two number one singles in the extremely  competitive U.S. market.  'Affirmation' consists of the up-beat typical  Savage Garden tunes, along with some superb ballads with the finest example  being 'Two Beds And A Coffee Machine'. <br />1. Affirmation - The third single  from this album, which is very up-beat.  The lyrics are simple, but very       true.  It could be described as being the 'I Want You' of this album.   5/5 <br />2. Hold Me - A slower song with a more mid-tempo feel.  Quite a nice  song.  4/5 <br />3. I Knew I Loved You - The second single which went number 1  in the U.S.  This song really cemented      Savage Garden as a band that  was not going anywhere in a hurry for which they received a lot of       deserved recognition for.  A beautiful ballad, and I would compare it to  'Truly Madly Deeply'.  5/5 <br />4. The Best Thing - An up-beat song that is  very catchy.  Not as good as 'Affirmation' but is still a great      song  to listen to.  4/5 <br />5. Crash And Burn - While the album has been  springing back and forth from number 1 in Australia, this      fourth  single has been strong enough to peak at number 16 on the charts which  isn't a bad position      for a fourth single.  In the U.S. it currently  sits at number 24 (29/05/00).  4.5/5 <br />6. Chained To You - This song  sounds a little different, with a bit of an eighties feel.  A very up-beat       song, but not one of Savage Garden's greatest.  3/5 <br />7. The Animal  Song - This first single was used in the movie 'The Other Sister', and  having heard it so      many times, it started to become a little annoying.   However, having seen this performed live at their      recent concert the  song really is a fun song and good to listen to.  4/5 <br />8. The Love After  Me - The beginning is a little ordinary, however it does build up to a good  chorus, and      is quite mid-tempo.  3.5/5 <br />9. Two Beds And A Coffee  Machine - Definately the highlight of this album.  This song is just  beautiful,      the lyrics are quite sad and the piano and strings are  superb.  It is sung beautifully and a perfect      song.  5/5 <br />10. You  Can Still Be Free - A a song that begins slow and calm, that gradually  builds up.  Darren's        voice travels really well in this song and is  evidence that he has a lot of vocal talent. 3.5/5 <br />11. Gunning Down  Romance - Quite a slow song, that is a little boring.  It doesn't really  reach anything        special.  2.5/5 <br />12. I Don't Know You Anymore -  With a really nice piano introduction, this ballad is a lovely touch to end         the album.  A beautiful song. 4.5/5 <br />13. The Animal Song (Hex  Hector Club Mix) (Bonus) - I am not a fan of club re-mixes, so this song  does        not suit me, and personally I don't like it.  However, if you  enjoy fast club re-mixes then this will        probably be enjoyed.  2/5  <br />Savage Garden have just kicked off their world tour, and will be soon  leaving Australia.  They performed here at Melbourne Park a few weeks ago,  and the concert was brilliant from beginning to end.  It was obviously  being much enjoyed by the audience who could not get enough.  In the  middle, there is a medley of some gorgeous ballads with Daniel on piano and  the rest was really up-beat and fun.  Daniel and Darren were both fantastic  live, and displayed an enormous amount of talent.  This concert is a must  see. <br />With two hit albums, a string of hit singles, millions of fans  globally and the U.S. market conquered, it makes you wonder else these boys  can achieve.  They have come a long way the last few years, and yet remain  such down to earth 'ordinary' people.  If their third album is able to  improve as much as the second to the first one, then it will be one amazing  piece of work
B00004THAY|5.0|I took a chance and ordered it &quot;unheard&quot; and don't regret this purchase at all.  This is a great addition to my collection of modern blues which I share with the listening audience every week via community radio.   Today's show featured several cuts from this cd and others by both artists.   The show evoked more enthusiastic feedback from listeners than any other  show in the 12 years I've been doing radio.  And I can't stop listening to  it at home, in the car, to wake up to.  BB and Eric work together, and  obviously enjoy making music, without tripping over egos.  My favorites --  &quot;Riding with the King&quot; and &quot;Hold On, I'm Coming&quot; take  both classic songs to new heights. Truly a collector's item -- buy it now!
6304584598|4.0|The ballet duo of Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn is something of a legend, and I'm pleased that a film was made of one of their performances and that it's available on DVD. The production is traditional and  sumptuous. A voice-over narrates the story. I'm not well informed about the  particulars of ballet and dance, but it seems to be a fine performance.  Nureyev looks to have had special tights made to accentuate his behind;  it's hilariously prominent. The film is old and rather faded, but its  appearance suits the overall atmosphere and the ebbing memories of that  time. The DVD, by the way, has no extra materials, but nevertheless I  highly recommend it.
B00004THAY|5.0|I took a chance and ordered it &quot;unheard&quot; and don't regret this purchase at all.  This is a great addition to my collection of modern blues which I share with the listening audience every week via community radio.   Today's show featured several cuts from this cd and others by both artists.   The show evoked more enthusiastic feedback from listeners than any other  show in the 12 years I've been doing radio.  And I can't stop listening to  it at home, in the car, to wake up to.  BB and Eric work together, and  obviously enjoy making music, without tripping over egos.  My favorites --  &quot;Riding with the King&quot; and &quot;Hold On, I'm Coming&quot; take  both classic songs to new heights. Truly a collector's item -- buy it now!
B00001QEG5|5.0|This is one of the greatist album    Twisted Sister has ever put out. This is what rock is all about. Hot Love, Love is for suckers, I want this night to last forever is the best of the best. Way to go boys..Keep up the good  work
0671004611|5.0|Colonel Corso's account of alien technology being implemented into mainstream technological R &amp; D is remarkable. My grandmother always thought that a visit by aliens is how we've all this technology today. She  wasn't far from the truth.<br />The crash of legend in the New Mexico desert  back in July of 1947 is where this starts. The Colonel gives brief,  scattered accounts of the different cast of characters. They all  substantiate each other solidly.  <br />Fast forward 14 years: the Colonel is  second in command at Army R &amp; D at the Pentagon. Working through his  &quot;nut file&quot;, he and his boss work covertly to introduce alien  technologies recovered in that crash to an unsuspecting world. Nightvision,  lasers, the silicon chip, particle beams, and kevlar can be attributed to  visitors from another planet.<br />Five stars. Put this one in your  collection.

0783226063|1.0|Prior to viewing this film, I read the book it was based upon and enjoyed it. Unfortunately, those who brought it to film flunked the very real challenge. Certainly a great deal of effort shows through in the costumes  and casting, as other reviewers have noted. But overall, the production  values are poor. The film is muddy and the colors generally muted. The  special effects are unremarkable at best, although allowances must be made  for the age of the film.<br />Far more serious is the terrible editing. There  is absolutely no sense of plot continuity or resolution. The film makes  gigantic leaps from scene to scene to the next, stringing unrelated events  together with no attempt at segueway, follow-up or explanation. Unless the  viewer is extremely familiar with the book, it is completely impossible to  keep up at all. Several scenes from the book are thrown in in with no rhyme  or reason, as if the whole point were to bring that moment to tape  regardless of how it integrates with the whole. To top it off, several  changes were made to the original story line (such as the introduction of  &quot;weirding devices&quot;) that add nothing to the story and serve only  to make the whole mess more confusing even for those who are familiar with  the print version. I seriously doubt that anybody viewing this film without  having first read the book would find the film engaging in the least, and  it is a distinct struggle for those of us who have.
6305558167|5.0|Excalibur is a very clever film, in that it managed to remain true to Thomas Malory's excellent fifteenth century account of the Arthurian legends. His book &quot;Le Morte d'Arthur&quot; is a VERY lengthy  collection of stories, not so much in terms of its volume, but in the  amount of action that takes place. While Malory focused more on the knights  of the Round Table and those associated with it, Excalibur focused on  Arthur. John Boorman elegantly captured the essence of Arthur's story,  Lancelot's betrayal, and the fall of Camelot. Constraints (likely in the  budget) lead to some obvious technical weakness in the film, though that  did not detract from the quality of the story. It is easily the best film  adaptation of the original legends, and is not a &quot;modern  retelling,&quot; though it manages wonderful revisionist technique.  All-in-all it is a great film, though admittedly would be enjoyed most by  those with an interest in the legends. My vote (5 out of 5 stars) is  enthusiastic, but qualified.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Of all 80's movies, this is one of my favorites. Jerry O'Connell is truly in his prime in this male bonding flick. Everyone will like this movie, but men will love the coming together of these rambunctious boys and the  nostalgic setting.
B000006045|5.0|Great. A definite step forward by Massive Attack. Dark but not scary, gloomy but enlightening, very relaxing, perfect at nights. It helps to feel the true essence of the world, the thinnest net of unvisible silk threads  that hold things around us together, the mechanism that provides space for  both the routine and miracle.
1573301043|4.0|The only reason I bought this tape is because of Mariah's amazing performances of My All, Make It Happen, and Chain Of Fools with the Aretha. Those are the highlights and the only thing good about the tape....
0441003257|5.0|I love Terry Pratchett.  And I love Neil Gaiman.  I hadn't imagined them together - until I read Good Omens.  It's a fabulous, funny book, with great characters (I want to be Crowley when I grow up).  It also has a  message, if you're willing to look for it.<br />However, it may not be for the  very religious or those who can't take their views with some  humor.<br />Still, it's one of my favorite books and I've read it numerous  times.  It still cracks me up every time.
B00004T1NA|5.0|A stunning album of the highest magnitude! That being said, let me break it down and qualify it (IMO). I am a long-time prog-head (having graduated from HS at the arguable zenith of prog-rock, 1974). I embrace the masters  (Yes, ELP,PF &amp; KC), and generally see neo-prog as a pale imitation of  the real thing with occasional flashes of brilliance, I must give pause and  fully enjoy the work of Steven Wilson and his bandmates of PT. LBS is as  poppy and accessible as Stupid Dream was, and a definate departure from  their solid spacey, psychelic excursions on previous efforts such as  Signify, The Sky Moves Sideways and the glorious live album Coma Divine.  However, Steven Wilson does manage to serve up a wonderful banquet on this  latest outing which boasts influences as disparate as the Beatles (How is  Your Life Today?/Where We Would Be) Pink Floyd (Hatesong/Russia on Ice) and  even Trent Reznor's studio finesse (Russia...)It has catchy melodies,  melancholy tunes and innovative excursions into the netherworld of one's  own mind and imagination). Although I DO prefer the previous material  mentioned, I can appreciate what Steven is doing here. It's difficult road  to walk, maintaining one's musical integrity, doing something one is proud  of and keeping the fickle record-buying public happy and the corporate  suits off your back). Lightbulb Sun seems to walk that road without being  contrived or pretentious. I praise Steven Wilson for his artistic vision  and applaude the musicians Barbieri,Edwin and Maitland for their input  which make this a joy to listen to. &gt;Best tracks for MY ears are Russia  on Ice, Hatesong and Shesmovedon (really beautiful harmonies and I love  Steve's vulnerable phrasing)in that order. I find it refreshing to hear The  Minerva Quartet (violins, cello and viola) as well as the guimbri (a  Moroccon string instrument) fitting in nicely with a Fender Rhodes, Hammond  organ and a scorching fuzzed out guitar solo and ending with church bells  clanging in the distance all in a span of 13 minutes. It's all that I  emrace prog for, my friend! Lovely songs are How is Your Life Today,The  Rest Will Flow, Where We would Be and Feel So Low, with Lightbulb Sun being  the catchiest and prime candidate for radio play. The only clinker is 4  Chords That Made a Million, which is a throwaway in my book, but that's why  there's chocolate and vanilla....Beautiful packaging, photography and some  of the most original and engaging music I've heard this year. Fans of  Spock's Beard will like this eclectic conglomeration, die hard fans of PF  may find it a blatant rip-off or contrived. Listen for yourself and decide  what you think. Meanwhile I'm putting this on &quot;speed dial&quot; on my  CD changer for many future listens.I'll mention in closing that Steven has  some alter egos in the form of Bass Communion (ambient), IEM(Krautrock  worship), No-Man (solo noodlings) as well as appearing on Fish's  &quot;Sunsets on Empires&quot; album and producing, sitting in all over the  planet. He's an omnipresent prodigy, and seems like a genuinely likable  fellow (saw him at Progfest'99 in SF)
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is one of my favorite films, and certainly one of the best films of 1999. I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD, and soaked in every nuance of it. But it's pointless for me to sing its praises, for people either like it or they don't. Whether or not I like it won't change their mind. However, I felt compelled to write this review because of  another review I read by flickjunkie. Reactionary reviews like that remind  me that there is one aspect about this film that seems to overshadow  everything else about it: it's misunderstood. Most people think one of two  things about Fight Club. 1) It's a brawl film, a guy's movie, something  that a bunch of brainless lugs would like. And, 2) It's a fascist film that  wants everyone to destroy civilization as we know it. The truth: it is  neither. The film is a warning. It's saying that we're being numbed by  society. That in itself is dangerous, and true. However, the true warning  is not about how we are being numbed. The warning is about how some people  are drawn to incresingly violent solutions to their numbness. It's a  warning that fascism is actually very seductive when you are young, yet  becoming mature is seeing that more constructive, and less destructive  methods are what is necessary to move society forward into a more  meaningful place. This movie is condeming everything that the critics are  saying it is preaching. I really wish that people would take the time to  really understand a film before they react violently against it. And  remember, use soap.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This cd is so good! No wonder it's so high on the billboards! This cd is so good that I'm going to tell you about each track. 1. Oops!..I did it Again: This is a great song, it's fun, It's dancable (I memorized the  dancing moves to the entire song!) and I love the chorus! 2. Stronger:  Another good dance song. I like the bridge 3. Don't Go Knocking on My Door:  Pretty good song, but not one of the best. 4. (I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction: Good song, I love the chorus 5. Don't let me be the Last to  Know: I love this song 6. What You See (Is What U Get): A good song, the  tune is great, but the lyrics are too stupid 7. Lucky: Ah, here it is, the  best song on the cd, it has a great tune, a good meaning, and I love it!   8. One Kiss From You: One of the Most Original songs on the cd, I like it!  9. Where Are You Now? A BEAUTIFUL slow song, like Christina Aguilera's  &quot;I Turn to You&quot; 10. Can't Make You Love Me: Another good dance  song 11. When Your Eyes Say It: Another good slow song 12. Dear Diary: A  Cute song, I love it!  Well, that's all I have to say, but you HAVE to buy  tha cd!
1559409002|5.0|Carnival of Souls is an old B-film that you might have seen on old Saturday night horror shows. As Herk Harvey (the director) said, this film was shot on a budget that wouldn't have sustained the opening moments of  Back To The Future. However, this film is able to sustain a creepy and  oppressive atmosphere throughout, and that is the major achievement. Even  though I knew when every &quot;scary&quot; moment was coming, and I guessed  the ending 20 minutes before the film actually ended, that knowledge didn't  ruin it for me. That's how strong the movie is, that you can enjoy the film  even if you knew everything about it. The acting is stiff and the dialogue  is often stilted, but that just adds to the strange and dark atmosphere of  the film. And the Criterion release is a real gem. Two discs, the first has  the theatrical release of the film, and the second has the director's cut.  The film looks incredible. I've yet to see such an old and cheaply made  movie look so good. And the extras are also great. Documentaries, outtakes,  interviews, and oh, that organ music. If you're a fan of horror, you must  own this film. If you're a film buff, you must own it. If you're a DVD  afficionado, you must own it. If you're just looking for a good movie to  watch on a Saturday night, then please, choose this one. It delivers.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|Okay, I'll tell you this much, Jennifer has really awsome songs, but her voice is not good at all. The cd is really good though, and worth buying.
0380788624|2.0|Neal Stephenson might well have told his story in some 300 pages instead of 910 if he had left out things like a 17 page email from the story's main character. I found the insertion of Stephenson's pet 'ideas' annoying -  they have little to do with the story. Snow Crash was substantially better.
0312952813|4.0|Connely is likeable for all kinds of reasons. What I like about his work is how he portrays the LAPD as a diseased institution - a cuckhold of the media, city politics and all the heavy infighting that go on inside the  LAPD. Then you have Bosch, who manages to doggedly pursue his cases while  limboing through the precarious balance of the LAPD political sphere. Bosch  manages to do this while keeping a cool head, keeping his wits about him  and meeting his deadlines. <br />The narration is fast, lean and  spare.<br />Black Ice is interesting because Bosch is teaming up with other  law enforcement agencies: the DEA and the Calexico PD. We get a convincing  glimpse of law enforcement in Mexico. We also get a rollercoaster of a  climax when the DEA makes a helicopter raid on a heroin ranch in Mexico.
B000002OX5|2.0|Don't get me wrong.  I am a huge Who fan and already have my tickets to their concert in Tampa in September.  That said, with a couple of exceptions, this cd in my humble opinion is mostly silly junk. I guess I  just don't get it.<br />There are a lot better Who cds' for sale and I would  recommend that you buy any of them before you get this one.
B00004STCB|5.0|Arguably the best film ever made, this movie has it all. Brilliantly directed with bold, hard close-ups, superbly cast with the incomparable Eastwood, the big screen's all-time best bad guy, Lee Van Cleef and comic  relief from Eli Wallach in the role of Tuco, a two bit bandit. The  brilliantly composed score is the icing on the cake. I could watch this  movie ANY TIME even though it's well over 2 1/2 long. Highly recommended!
B00004T9UF|4.0|I'm older (45), a feminist, and not a rap fan but  I love this album. I'm his worst nightmare - a fan who is a soccer mom and about as far removed from the street as you can get.  I hope he has a long, fruitful career.  If  his talent holds out I'd love to hear what he has to say when he's 40.  Unlike most of the reviewers here, I don't think &quot;Stan&quot; is the  best track... I think &quot;I am&quot; is a masterpiece.  In it, his rage  is focused on an  appropriate target for once and he is a refreshing  antidote to the Backstreet Boys.   Listening to this album is dangereous...  Inside this middle-aged fat woman is a skinny white boy dying to get out.   I didn't know I had it in me.
0446677450|5.0|I am 13 years old, and I read this book last year.  Mr. Kiyosaki's book offers many possibilities for making money, and deals with the phsycological differences among people of the 3 basic classes.  It has an easy to read, conversational format that makes you think, and offers many  good rhetorical questions.  The message that the author is trying to send  you throughout the entire book, is that assets feed you, and liabilities  eat you.  Although I will not be using the information in this book until  about 15 years later, it made me start thinking.  I cannot rave enough.   This should be required high school reading material!
B000001GXC|5.0|Those who think that Herbert von Karajan was not on home turf with the basic German repertoire of the 19th century should reconsider after listening to these excellent recordings.  The sound quality is excellent as  well as the balance and blend of the instruments.  The orchestra playing is  very precise and expressive.  The intonation is very good, something that  is not always true of Karajan's recordings.  This is truly beautiful music.   Enjoy!
6305657939|1.0|I never expectec that director McTiernan could deliver such a lousy movie, tasteless, without any rhythm and with a history without any real climax. It's plain boring. Russo and Brosnan are in the worst acting of their  career( handicapped by the awful script), there's no chemistry between  them. It's just another movie to watch when you absolutely nothing to do.
6305426651|5.0|When I first decided to watch this movie I was worried that the subtitles would take away from it, but boy was I suprised.  By the time I was 15 minutes into the movie, i didn't even notice that I was having to read the  subtitles.  This is a great film, that I can't recommend enough.  Watch it,  you won't regret it.
6305364648|5.0|Delivering more than the usual high quotient of blow-you-out-of-your-seat  SFX and action sequences, True Lies also delivers what might be the best  performances of Arnold's and Jamie Lee's careers. Their delightfully comic  transformations (particularly hers) inject a very human spirit into this  wonderfully engaging spy/action/triller, which is not at all what you might  expect from the pre-Titanic James Cameron.  Bill Paxton is hilarious, and  Tom Arnold, of all people, actually shines in his comic turn as Arnie's  superslueth sidekick.  The action mayhem that ensues, matched with Jamie  Lee's bravura sexpot, is entertaining beyond belief. And the wonderful  tango sequence is nearly worth the price of the movie.
B00004T8RK|4.0|It's hard to not compare every Pearl Jam record to Ten or Vs.  They were great records and will never be improved upon.  So, if you take that into consideration and look at Binaural on it's own merits, it's a great modern  rock record.  Pearl Jam have never showed so much range.  Unfortunately,  some people interpret that as sucking or boring.  At first I was  dissapointed that after the first three rockers, the album really slowed  down, particularly in the middle.  But afer extended listening, I like the  slower songs just as much.  I don't want another Ten.  I've already got it.   This is a mature record from a great band that I know I will be listening  to for years to come.

B00004TH83|5.0|I bought this CD.... somewhat on a lark.... just from listening to the brief audio clips here on amazon.com, and I have fallen in love with this album.  (Thank you Amazon)<br />As for her voice, she has an amazingly  beautiful instrument.  I believe I read that she was classically trained,  and you can tell.  Her musical phrasing is much better than all the other  pop diva wanna-bees out there.  Yes, her voice is somewhat similiar to  Celine's, but it is richer... not as shrill.  If you like Celine Dion or  Linda Eder, you will like Lara Fabian.    <br />The songs and arrangements are  great.  Some of my favorites are &quot;Adagio&quot;, &quot;You're not from  here&quot;, &quot;Yeliel (My Angel)&quot;, &quot;I will Love Again&quot;,  and &quot;Broken Vow&quot;.  Everytime I listen to &quot;Broken Vow&quot;,  I get goose bumps.  <br />If you are sick of pop songs that are musically  tright, this album is for you.  It is full of interesting songs that are  very well sung.  I may just have to order some of her French albums.
6300248550|5.0|Unlike others, I swooned over Timothy Dalton as &quot;James Bond&quot;.  His portryal of the young Phillip of France in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; displayed his promise to become a very versatile  actor.<br />Timothy Dalton's Edward Fairfax Rochester is unsurpassed -- only  George C. Scott's portrayal comes close.  Is Dalton too handsome for the  role?  If I were a &quot;looks only&quot; sort, perhaps that would be  important.  &quot;But, you see, I am not.&quot;  Character is far more  important, and Timothy Dalton contributed to Rochester's voluminous palette  of traits in such a way that I forgot his good looks.  He fairly mesmerized  me as he brooded one moment, then became sardonic, questing, seductive,  conniving, humorous, emotional and romantic.  His Rochester IS  Rochester.<br />And I applaud Zehla Clark's Jane Eyre.  Unlike her  predecessors and successors (many whose characterizations hinted that  Jane's early experiences had humbled her into a pale, too-humble mouse, so  much so that I couldn't imagine anybody finding such a person attractive).  Zehla Clarke, however, seemed to sense that what little Jane could salvage  from life, she valued, and what she valued about herself she allowed to  become her guiding light.  Her portrayal gives new meaning to the phrase  &quot;the quiet storm.&quot;<br />To Dalton and Clarke, BRAVO!
B000006TZ8|5.0|After the vibrant energy of their debut (&quot;In the City&quot;), their second album (&quot;This is the Modern World&quot;) was something of a disappointment. One had to wonder if Paul Weller really only had one good  album in him. This third LP put that wonder firmly to rest.<br />On &quot;All  Mod Cons&quot; Paul Weller finds a truly original lyrical voice, based  heavily on the English storytelling tradition well-worn by the likes of Ray  Davies, and the band kicks in with a tremendous jump in sophistication. The  love/hate of &quot;To Be Someone&quot; and miserable circumstance of  &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot; capture the emotion of  20-something London with a closeness, a personalness, that few achieved  before or after.  Weller would go on to even greater brilliance (e.g., the  &quot;Sound Affects&quot; LP), but many of his gems are here.<br />The band's  musical muscle may have been born on their debut, but &quot;All Mod  Cons&quot; in the genesis of Paul Weller's songwriting genius.

0679720200|5.0|Camus' work is altogether phenomenal, but this book did something extra for me.  The Cure even made a song about it. Meursault is one of the most intruiging characters i've ever come in contact with.  The death of his  mother, the love that his &quot;girlfriend&quot; Marie showed towards  him,  and his own crime never moved Meursault to express or acknowledge any  remorse or loving.  Camus wrote this in first person, so it was fabulous to  be able to 'read through the eyes of this so-called madman.  Meursault was  persecuted for being misundertood and unremourseful, displaying the only  &quot;human&quot; qualities he knew of/cared to express.  Camus did a  stunning, everlasting job with this character and novel.
B00004U30D|5.0|This movie is beyond belief.Did it live up to the hype?No it went beyond that.The movie is definately not for everyone.All close-minded people need not watch it.But if you are willing to accept the dark beauty of the movie,i highly reccomend it.It's probably my favorite movie.I can't even  begin to describe any single scenes because there are so many great  ones.Some sound so simple but they leave you breathless.Who would have  thought a bag flying through the air could be so beautiful.On person's  review said it was not for children,but I'm 14 and I definately understand  whats going on.The sexual scenes are tasteful and only add to the story.One  of the most touching scenes is when one character removes her top but the  camera zooms in on her eyes.It is truly a classic.The first great movie of  the new millenium.
0441172717|5.0|When I first read Dune, a couple years ago, I was enthralled by it's wonderful writing style.  It seemed as though Frank Herbert preserved the freshness and vitality of Dune and whenever I open it up I get that  freshness.  With all of this pulp science fiction nowadays, it's nice to be  able to unlock the times of old.  Paul Atreides is one of the most fully  realized character in any book I've read, and the Baron is evil but not  cartoonish. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood, with their special breeding  programs, and the Guild with their plots and plans,make  Dune a realistic,  thought provoking, and fun book.  Read this or the sand worms of Arrakis  will come looking for you next.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is one great cd, I was looking at the other reviews and I do not get why people have to be so mean. Who cares how she got here or if she writes her own music, she has done some or parts of some, whatever they let her  use. It is fun and happy music. Dance songs are also fun. I give this Cd 10  stars. I just hate that so many people keep giving it 1 star it is not  helping any. This is a great cd for fun happy music. A lot of Pop is fun  music.
B00003CWPR|3.0|Overall, &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was a disappointment compared to Kubrick's great work--&quot;2001 A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;--though it started out promising  enough with a tour de force performance by Nicole Kidman in the film's  early episodes, and a breathtaking &quot;ritual&quot;/orgy that climaxed  the film's first half. The second half was all Tom Cruise, and therein lies  the film's weakness. Not only is Cruise nowhere near the actor that Nicole  Kidman is in terms of sheer talent, but the story rather falls apart, the  conclusions reached neither convincing nor even very tight. The latter half  of the film deteriorates into meandering nonsense as Tom Cruise tries to  solve the &quot;mystery&quot; behind what happened to him and others who  attended the orgy...you'd get no less from the story if you simply turned  the sound off...the only benefit (if you're a Tom Cruise fan) is the  privelege of seeing his face--hardly enough for me. It's too bad, too,  because Kubrick deserved to leave this world differently than  half-brilliant/half-mediocre.
B00003CWTH|5.0|I watched Magnolia last week on television pay per view, in my hotel room, at the end of a terribly long day at work - not the best time to see a movie. Yet what I saw was so enthralling, so moving, my attention was  rapt.<br />There are scenes in some movies that are terribly moving because  the writer has such sympathy for people who are hurt or lost in some way. I  think of Timothy Hutton's character in Made in Heaven or Diane Lane's in  Walk on the Moon. Magnolia has that sympathy in spades for an entire world  in hurt, living in regret or frustration or worry. Although some reviewers  clearly didn't respond, I think the vast majority of people will. <br />It's  an interconnecting tale of many characters with connections to one  another's pasts or present (either through family or work) in a day in the  Los Angeles suburbs.  There are many recurring subjects - parents and  children, drug addiction, television, forgiveness, insecurity of one's  appeal to others, cancer, the haunting of the past, coincidence  itself.<br />The acting is superb, the movie deliberately unrealistic in some  effects, yet terribly so in many others. The &quot;philosophy&quot; of the  movie is quite old-fashioned - a restatement of the importance of love and  understanding between people, regardless of their failures as human beings.  There is an astonishing simplicity about much of the dialogue - e.g.,  &quot;Dad, you've got to be nicer to me&quot; and much of what the  policeman says about forgiveness.<br />I have read reviews here attacking the  screenplay - yet most people will want to cry during the course of it.  That's pretty powerful. <br />The movie is haunting - when it's over, it makes  the particular thing you are doing seem insignificant. Why are its effects  so profound? I don't know - perhaps because the characters are so well  drawn, the acting so magnificent, the desires of the characters so present  in all of us, the intensity of the dilemmas facing human beings so vividly  displayed. <br />This is a movie that will strike very deeply. It cannot  easily be chewed, discussed and forgotten in a drink with another after the  movie. It doesn't easily lend itself to &quot;I liked this part, how about  you?&quot; sort of discussion. <br />This wonderful movie is probably best  seen alone. Do see it - you won't forget it.

B00004SCX6|5.0|i've noticed that those who have given low ratings to the album don't even own the album. if u haven't heard it don't write a review b'cos this album is truly cool. for those who don't like the pop genre don't critisize this  album b'cos u don't even like the kind of music. but there many others like  me, who enjoy this type of music and her selling so many million albums  proves that britney pop is not crap.
1559409010|5.0|It is often difficult to decide how to properly introduce loved ones to Monty Python.  The Lumberjack song?  The Parrot Sketch?  The Holy Grail?  All good choices, but I suggest Life of Brian, Monty Python's most  consistently funny effort.<br />The movie is laugh-out-loud funny for  newcomers, but with plenty of almost subliminal jokes that can only be  fleshed out with repeated viewings.  And repeated viewings are a pleasure  with the new Criterion Edition.  The transfer is pristine and the extras  will keep even the most seasoned Python fans busy for days.  There really  is no reason NOT to own this disc.<br />The movie itself is classic Python;  dead-on satire of religious fanaticism (not of religion, as some would  suggest) plus the best comedic ending since &quot;Some Like it Hot.&quot;   If your friends don't understand the inherent humor in &quot;Always Look on  the Bright Side of Life,&quot; it's time to find new friends.
076783819X|1.0|Positive:  Cinematography was decent. Negative:  Very unbelievable plot  and dialogue.  I kept thinking what a great movie this COULD be with some  competent directing and writing.  I hate to see good movies wasted and this  is a perfect example. If this movie was so suspensefull, why was I  fforwarding through most of the final 30 minutes?  I started to get annoyed  early at the corny coincedences that you see in bad suspense movies.  Then  it got worse when I was able to easily guess what would always happen next,  until the end, which I will concede would have been great with a half way  decent lead up.  Finally, the movie became unbearable when certain simple  scenes were made excrutiatingly long.  Just add alot of suspense music and  some car chases and you have most of the last 15 minutes.  This movie trys  so hard to anger and unnerve me.  Well I guess it succeeded.  I was angry I  wasted 99 cents renting this thing from the bargain rack.  And guess what?  all copies were in stock.

B00004RFFL|1.0|The Astronaut's Wife (Rand Ravich, 1999)<br /> availability: still on the new release shelves on video<br /><br />You know it's a bad rental night when the highest hopes you have for a movie are of something that looked so utterly  silly in the previews that you had no desire to see it in the theaters.  Unfortunately, I got roped into this... and aside from the, uh,  &quot;climax&quot; &lt;snort&gt;, it wasn't really all that bad a movie,  aside from Charlize Theron's &quot;as ugly as I wanna be&quot;  hairdo.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and (how far the mighty have fallen!) Nick  Cassavettes are two astronauts who go into space to make some minor repairs  to a satellite, and are out of contact with Earth for two minutes while  they're on the other side of the shuttle. As a premise, this is kind of  boring; I didn't realize this wasn't a common occurrence on shuttle  missions. But, of course, something nasty happens, and the two come back to  earth in comas. Pretty soon Cassavettes and his wife (engagingly played by  Donna Murphy), the best of couples, are having marital problems, and Depp  and his wife (Theron) are close behind. Feel free to draw all conscusions  you need to-- and you're right. I don't need to spoil it, you can do it  yourselves well enough, I've no doubt.<br /><br />The good stuff here, aside from  a decent performance by Depp, is in the minor roles. Samatha Eggar pops up  as Theron's ob-gyn (and those of you familiar with Eggar's most famous role  will know why the irony of this was so delicious), and Clea DuVall, as  Theron's wisecracking sister, absolutely saved the first half of this movie  (note for Joy Fielding fans: DuVall is listed in the cast of the upcoming  See Jane Run).<br /><br />Unfortunately, these things aren't enough to hold it  all together, and as the plot slowly disintegrates (and this is another  case of &quot;great premise, bad execution&quot;) the whole thing becomes  laughable; by the time we get around to seeing the bad guy, we don't care  how stupid he is. He<br />can't be any worse than the situation he's been  placed in. * 1/2 solely for Eggar and DuVall.don't care  how stupid he is. He<br />can't be any worse than the situation he's been  placed in. * 1/2 solely for Eggar and DuVall.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is just brilliant. Read the other reviews for more in depth examination, but as a film lover and always preferring &quot;relevant&quot; films, this one stands with the best commentaries on american mores and  standards like &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. As  a fan of great cinema I was flabbergasted. I own all of Fincher's films and  he ranks as one of our most important voices. As a man watching a film  about being a man in today's society I was shaken to the core of my being.  I've spent days re thinking my own addictions to consumerism, my fear and  loathing of other men, unresolved conflicts with my father...this movie  does what i want every movie i see to do..change me through the experience.  PLUS the DVD release is so chock full of extras it will take me a month to  get through it all!
0783242808|1.0|American Pie (Paul Weitz, 1999)<br /> availability: in every major video store you can hit with a stick<br /><br />Every bad thing I dreaded about this brainless, boring, unwatchable movie given the trailers i saw for it was  absolutely right. The acting was atrocious, the script was one-dimensional  and stupid, the jokes (what few there were) were completely unfunny, and  the whole thing stank as bad as the outdoor toilet at a national park. I  can't believe I sat through the whole thing. Zero stars. Go rent Porky's;  at least there were a few laughs to be found there.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver is a very gratifying book.  And it's not just for kids.  Children will be fasinated by the story of Jonas, the Giver, and the perfect world they live in. Adults will find a sufficiently good read here too. Lowry is a very talented writer, and with The Giver has fabricated an  awesome idea, flexing her muscles with a good plot and memorable, likeable  characters. My only complaint was this book could have been so much more.  As an older reader (still young at heart I assure you :) I found myself  grimising at how underdeveloped the Giver character was. He's such a  remarkable creation, show us and tell us more about him Lois!  I realize  this is a Young Adult book, and that explains the shortness of it, but  still, even as a kid I think I would want to know more. More about the  other communities, a little bit more about Jonas, and mostly, so much more  about the Giver! Towards the end, he simply disappears too. Still, despite  Lowry's lack of giving us much on the Giver, her novel is a very  exceptional read for the youth, and a good, quick and easy read for the  adult, that will make you think.
6300183211|4.0|This 1983 hit film became a movie landmark after it's release. A movie based on the American-Cuban invasion of 1980. Al Pachino plays the mischievious Tony Montana who evades his home country seeking the land of opportunity. His tenaciousness takes him to the top of Miami's Cocaine drug trade but not without the sacrifice of an unforgetable torture scene in which he watches his friend murdered. Tony takes many wise and unwise chances as he lures Michelle Pfeifer away from his Cartel boss. Oliver Stone directs an extremely smart movie with memorable dialogue. The messages are top notch and the movie satisfies the need for vicariousness but then leads you down the path of Tony Montanas self destuction. Many great lines in this movie but to borrow James Cagney's White Heat, \\"Top of the World Ma\\"! The movies length is in question when it ends on such a sour note however this masterpiece should be viewed at least once and not by the weak at heart. Scarface is more the realistic documentary than the film to watch over and over. Some scenes are truly priceless!
6305127638|5.0|If you're a &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; fan, this is the film for you. The Federation's most deadly enemy, the Borg, are en route for earth --- and in &quot;Terminator&quot; style, they're headed to  earth's past to assimilate earth while they've still got technology worth  assimilating, but are too vulnerable to fight off the Borg's superior  firepower.<br />Excellent performances by the entire cast including the  awesome Alfre Woodard and Oscar nominee James Cromwell.<br />Relationships  among the crew (especially between Worf and Picard) are explored and  developed further. The friendship between Picard and Data is also put to  the test when the Borg Queen seeks to seduce them both with her promises of  power and perfection.<br />The DVD is lacking in that it just has a couple of  theatrical trailers and that's it. It would have been nice to see some  behind-the-scenes footage, special effects, out takes, etc... it's almost a  waste of the medium.  I first bought this on VHS, which included an  interesting motion photo of Picard, the Queen and Data (who morphs into an  assimilated Data when you tilt the image)... the DVD doesn't have this cool  motion photo on the box/case.  I definitely prefer DVD to VHS because  (unless you set it on fire or let your dogs play frisbee with them) DVDs  essentially last forever and tapes are not a permanent medium and are  subject to skipping, tracking errors and eventually, decay.  It's nice that  you can quickly jump from scene to scene w/ a DVD and there is never a need  to rewind before you eject... but other than the inherent advantages of the  DVD medium over tape, the DVD offers nothing else you can't view on the  tape. The tape version is also in letterbox format.<br />Other than the lack  of extras, this film is awesome. I sat on the edge of my seat when I saw  this in the theater and I see it at least once a month now that I have it  on DVD. It is exciting and entertaining and definitely the best Star Trek  film yet.
6305165912|5.0|Careful with this one: it's all about quirky exchanges from its quixotic characters (note Goodman's brilliant performance), and not about plot. Most viewers will spend too much time trying to follow the mystery, and will get  frustrated watching Bridges and Goodman not getting on with it but bowling  and talking. This is equivalent to watching the Big Sleep (the template for  &quot;Lebowski&quot; -- the Coen Bros. say the film is their old hippie  friend cast in the lead of the Big Sleep) and wishing Bogart and Bacall  would stop talking and get on with the mystery, itself impossible to  decipher. If you can stop worrying about the mystery and just relax, the  film ranks with Python's Holy Grail for hilarious exchanges and individual  scenes. Frequently my roommate and I will put on the DVD just to watch one  or two choice scenes, or recount the exchanges to each other verbatim, as  we might do about the Holy Hand-Grenade in Python. Even better than Raising  Arizona, though the latter is plot driven.
B000001IPL|5.0|Smash is by far considered one of Offspring's best works.  The first track, &quot;Time to Relax&quot; isn't what you'd call a song, but it's fun to listen to.  &quot;Nitro(youth energy)&quot; is the first real song and  gives you a need to live life to the fullest.  The infamous &quot;Bad  Habit&quot; is known my most people for it's use of colorful metaphors.   &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; is one of the songs which also has a video to  it.  &quot;Genocide&quot; is about our &quot;dog eat dog existence.&quot;   &quot;Something to Believe in&quot; has incredible vocal use in it and has  a good tone to it.  &quot;Come out a Play(you gotta keep 'em  seperated)&quot; is the song that made the Offspring known.  It is to this  day one of my favorite Offspring songs out of all the alblums.  &quot;Self  Esteen&quot; opens with a desire to keep yourself listening to the lyrics  and adjust from the gang fights of &quot;Come out a Play&quot; to a girl  who has control over her &quot;boyfriend&quot;.  The next two tracks aren't  as good as the previous two, but there still worth listening to.   &quot;What happened to you?&quot; reminds me of California for some reason.   The rest of the CD explains itself especially &quot;Smash&quot; which the  entire alblum is named after.  I do suggest to buy this CD for it's style  of Punk Rock.  Smash, Ignition, and Offspring (a fairly unpopular alblum  released in 1995) are the true punk Offspring had, or still has.  This and  Americana are the CD's I suggest for a first time listener of this band and  I'm sure many other Offspring listeners would agree with me.
B000031WD8|4.0|I was skeptical of AMERICAN PIE as well.  I don't remember PORKIE'S, but  the comparison to that 1980's teen flick wasn't a good sign.  But I sat  down with a group of guys this weekend and watched AMERICAN PIE and laughed  wildly.<br />Yes, it's a film about guys who vow to get laid before they  graduate high school.  But the adventures that happen to them along the way  are hilarious.  I'm not a snob about my comedy.  I found the  diarrhea/farting scene in the girl's bathroom more funny than anything  Woody Allen has done for the last 8 years.  And the female character who  begins every sentence with &quot;One time at band camp...&quot; has a line  that stops the movie -- and will make you laugh for weeks at the memory.  And the father/son scenes with Jason Biggs' are funny as well -- parents  just don't have it easy when it comes to sex and their teenage sons.<br />This  movie actually made me think (after I laughed hysterically).  Here I am in  my 30's, and I realized how great movies like this are for teenagers.   Seriously!  Those teenage years are just awful! Having sex for the first  time is just awful!  Thank God I don't have to go through that again.  This  movie makes it ok to laugh about.  And it even gives a good lesson about  falling in love.<br />The young performers are great.  Chris Klein is my  absolute favorite, just because he seems to have &quot;star quality&quot;.   I'm looking for him to break out of the pack and be one of America's rising  stars.<br />All-in-all, AMERICAN PIE is a very good movie.  It's loaded with  laughs, but not as shallow as you might think.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I bought Americana back in June of 1999 and I still love it.  When I first listened to it, I was impressed enough to buy Smash which was released in 1994 my Offspring.  Eventually, I bought all the CD's Offspring had to  offer, and Americana was the best next to Smash.  It has an interesting  mood to the music which is first noticed at the beginning of &quot;Have you  Ever&quot;.  My favorite track on Americana is either &quot;She's got  issues&quot; or &quot;Pretty Fly(For a white guy)&quot;.  If you should buy  any Offspring CD, make Americana the first or Smash.  If you buy this CD, I  hope you'll enjoy it's themes and sound as much as I have.      I can't  wait till Offspring's new alblum to be released at the end of this year!   Total Immortal is awesome on the ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE SOUNDTRACK!
B00004RF8J|5.0|LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is a little gem of a musical.  So many modern  attempts at producing a true film musical have failed.  This one, lead by  talented Frank Oz, succeeds.<br />First, the music is great.  From ballads  (&quot;Somewhere That's Green&quot;) to Motown (all the Girl's Chorus  songs, &quot;Mean Green Mother&quot;) the songs are wonderful.<br />The cast  is top-notch.  Ellen Greene is hilarious, over-the-top, and touching all at  once.  Rick Moranis is a great singer and born to play Seymour.  And the  cameos make this film lively.  Steve Martin's dentist is wickedly  funny.<br />I wish we could get the alternate ending back on this new DVD,  however.  (My one complaint!)
B00001OH7U|5.0|Even though Bowie is a music legend, his albums rarely rise to the level of a masterpiece. This is one big exception to the rule. There is not a single wasted second on this entire disk. The synth dominated arrangements  are excellent. Only Bowie could make melodies and lyrics as oblique as  TVC15 cool. Bottom Line: Buy this album!
B000002UA0|4.0|Well I finally picked up this amazing CD and can honestly say it was money well spent.  The significant difference between this Syd Barrett guided disc and the later discs guided by Roger Waters &amp; David Gilmore is  almost beyond words.  If you listen to this expecting the PF of DSOTM or  the Wall you will be extremely disappointed.  Check out the stellar  craftsmanship of the songs here and guitarmanship of Syd.  Sure, we are all  used to Gilmore's beautiful guitar work but I wonder where the band would  be had Syd been around.  Most of you have heard Astronomy Domine,  Interstellar Overdrive and maybe even Bike.  Pow R Toch H is spacey and  touches on the experimentation that would show in the bands later discs.  The Gnome is a simple, playful little ballad. About the only drawback is  Roger Waters early attempt at songwriting, Take Up thy Stethoscope and  Walk, (The only reason for 4 stars).  Some of the more standout tracks are  Lucifer Sam, Matilda Mother &amp; Interstellar Overdrive.  Syd, we miss you  and wish you well.  Thanks for a terrific album. If you're a PF fan then  you must own this.
0767849493|4.0|I've never had such a struggle about awarding stars as I've had about this movie.  Just to throw my cards on the table here, my dad was a Lutheran preacher and I've had my own personal, er, Issues with The Whole God Question.  In the end I had to give it 4 stars because what Kevin Smith has  had a notably worthy crack at doing is to try and reinvent the idea of  faith for a generation of people who generally wouldn't be inclined to go  for it.  And any film that thanks Howard Stern, John Milton and Martin  Scorsese in the final credits has to have _something_ going on.<br />My  personal take on this movie is that, somewhere between screenplay and final  cut, it got semi-seriously mutilated.  Smith's published screenplay is more  or less what you see on screen, but there are episodes - such as Jay and  Silent Bob's muse-inspired outburst in a bar (all I'll say is that Silent  Bob raps) - that are cut from the film, leaving gaping holes in the plot.   That was the point where I began to wonder whether the film was falling to  bits.<br />But in the end it's an amazing, sui generis mixture of cheesy  jokes and theological adventure.  I wish that somebody had had the courage  to make the film that Smith originally wrote, because it could have been  one of the bizarrest classics Hollywood has ever seen.  As it is, it's a  cheap-but-brilliant movie which overcomes narrative incoherence and a  crippled FX budget to be a genuinely imaginative story about the virtue of  faith as against the human distortions of organised religion.<br />Linda  Fiorentino is great as the permanently harrassed  great-great-several-more-levels-of-great-niece of Jesus, who finds herself  on a quest to prevent the unmaking of existence; she has this air  throughout much of the movie of not quite believing what she's got herself  into, which is thoroughly appropriate.  Alan Rickman is splendidly louche  and drawly as Metatron, the voice of God; Jason Mewes as Jay is even more  hilariously annoying than usual, and Smith himself is proving with each of  his films to be a great silent comedian as the ridiculously taciturn Silent  Bob.  <br />The rest of the cast are on flying form.  It was inspired casting  to have golden boys Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as a pair of vengeful  slacker-ish angels; Affleck in particular, with the benefit of some  severely aristocratic cheekbones, works up an impressively lordly contempt  for human frailty.  Jason Lee is also excellently sleazy as the  white-suited demon Azrael.  There are crackling cameos by Guinevere Turner  (as a sarky bus station attendant) and Janeane Garofalo (as Fiorentino's  co-worker in the abortion clinic), and Alanis Morrissette as YHWH is,  frankly, perfect, in the same way that Sinead O'Connor was ideal casting as  the Virgin in Neil Jordan's &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;.<br />There's no doubt  that Kevin Smith is a brilliant and intelligent storyteller; I've loved his  previous films and I gobble up his comics.  His talent as a director is  maybe no more than adequate to the stories he wants to tell, but at least  it's adequate.  He probably ought to be writing epic poems, but then nobody  would read them.  This is a weirdly moving and provocative film; all the  fart gags and insistently low tone are of a piece with the central idea  that nothing of God's creation deserves to be denied.  In that sense, it's  one of the few genuinely faith-ful movies since Pasolini's &quot;Il Vangelo  Secondo Matteo&quot;.  The church should be handing out copies after mass,  not protesting against it.  The only people in the film who are presented  in a  relentlessly negative way are anti-choice protestors, and whether or  not you approve of that is between you and your conscience.  I know where I  stand.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I think that this album is excellent.  Not only is there humour in it but it is also conveying some meaningful messages in Eminem's unique way.  The lyrics are good, the beats are good and I cannot complain about any aspect  of this album.  Of course, it's not for the light-hearted and you have to  be warned about the content of the album, but if you're a fan you'll love  it.  I recommend it to anyone who's into this kind of thing.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light is Madonna's best album to date. When I purchased the album, I didn't know what to think of it. It certainly was not what I expected it to be. But each time I listened to it, I liked it more and more. The songs  are entrancing, the lyrics thought-provoking.  Frozen is the most  accessible song on Ray of Light and with the Power of Good-bye Madonna has  crafted a sad, but yet uplifting ballad. Songs like Swim, Sky fits Heaven  and Skin are very good. It's a shame none of these were brought out on  single.   After all these years Madonna still knows how to surprise and  captivate an audience. And after listening to this album, I wonder what  Madonna will come up next.
B000002I97|4.0|Consider this picture: a short-haired anti-war singer/songwriter raised in Western Kentucky? Such a person couldn't exist. Sure they do - and his name is John Prine. The world of `John Prine' is simple, rational and urban. His  solemn tales love, loss and solitude are told with a shoulder shrugging  well-that's-the-way-it-goes attitude (Hello In There, Pretty Good, Quiet  Man). John takes life as it comes, and manages to keep his head held high.  An anti-Vietnam war theme runs through the CD. `Sam Stone' returns from  Vietnam addicted to morphine - \\"There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the  money goes.\\" And `Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore' is a  cynical anti-anthem condemning quasi-patriots. `John Prine' pays attention  to ladies who normally get little attention (much less respect): a topless  dancer (Spanish Pipedream), a waitress (Far From Me), and a homely fat girl  (Donald and Lydia).<br />John is a empathetic poet and a perceptive  storyteller: he observes people and situations that other's ignore during  their often hectic day-to-day pace. The most touching song on `John Prine'  is the stark and heart-stopping `Six O'Clock News.' I like `John Prine.'  Call it folk, call it country, but definitely call it an alternative to  insensitivity and apathy.
