B003GN38UM|4|It was exactly what i was looking for and arrived so quickly. would definitely use this seller again.
B00J97Q6E4|4|Was birthday gift for my daughter and it came right on time
B00817ECB2|5|These fit very well and many people have noticed how they cup my cheeks and don't creep up the butt like cheaper undies. The variety of colors are awesome and I can mix and match all week long. Thanks Fruit Fella's.
B00061NHYY|3|DOES NOT COME WITH BUTTONS.  I don't know why I thought it did, but it doesn't.  You'll have to purchase the buttons separately.  Also, I'm 6'2&#34;.  It's a little tight on me, I recommend maybe getting the tall version?
B00KRYO2GC|5|Cute and comfy fit great and super soft
B00IDHFK6G|5|Good long leggings that fall mid calf. They are thick and well made, and have a nice key pocket in the waistband. Thick enough to wear them on their own.
B0071AXD42|5|This belt is a fairly thick leather with a good solid buckle on it.  The stitching that holds the buckle on is only a single row of stitching so when that starts to go the belt will need to be repaired.  That is my only complaint.  I used this belt as part of my pirate attire for a ren fair and hung all sorts of oddities from it with no problem.
B00J8IX0VG|4|super cute, just had to wait a bit till my daughter could fit in it, but she is 3 1/2 months and it fits well now.
B004YIFQ44|5|the quality cont be beat. they are so warm the fit spot on. I wear them with a velour top .dynamite.
B000GISJT0|4|It was a little snug on her full figure, but we managed to have fun with it anyway! ;) Yes.
B000P55RYE|4|Very good fit..
B00M0FD988|3|these are much smaller than indicated, not 12 inches long.  luckily I have very small forearms, the gloves would be too small for most adult women
B000LGXWA8|4|Medium thickness, excellent for winter as a liner. Comfortable, wash well and my husbands says they do the job and help keep his feet warm in cold weather. We buy him 2 new pairs every year and I got a pair for myself this winter also. Keeps my feet from getting sweaty.
B00N9UDUH8|4|Think it's sized for pre teen girls but it's still cute
B000M4C12E|4|This book is a great source of information. It is helping my sister plan and she is not good at planning ahead.
B00COFZ536|3|the fit is perfect, but the pic makes it look white not the blue color that it is. The fit any everything else is great though
B00ACIFZ1Y|4|I ordered Hanes because I know I can always rely on the quality of their product. This purchase was no exception.
B00505DW2I|4|Thankfully I read the comments and knew ahead of time that this shirt ran small. I ordered a large instead of a medium and it fit nicely. Perfect easy costume!
B008YIG05O|3|love sweater but, i am not a junior in fact I am 5'0 , 125 pounds. So i ordered the medium. the body fits well but the sleeves are big. otherwise i think i will keep it
B003EDUZ5A|5|Very nice. It looks great on my husband!
B008WYDP1C|5|i love this it is just like the picture. if you dont like sculls dont worry the skull doesnt really show it has some cute stars on the top and bottom and the sweater is very soft and thin it is perfect with tights ive already washed it 4x times cold wash and hang dry!! but its held up great and same size and shape great quality especialy for the price
B004KBT3IU|5|I was torn between getting this bag or the medium sized one. The price difference at the time was only $10, but I didn't want to go for overkill. My decision came down to, \\"well, I can use this bag for trips and stuff too\\", so I went with the large. It's a very nice sized bag. What I mainly looked for in reviews was to see what everyone could fit in it. I was curious if my gym stuff, plus my military uniform could fit, and it definitely does. I *easily* fit a pair of boots, camo pants, t-shirt, camo shirt, towel, and shower stuff. With tons of room to spare. I easily could have gone with the medium for gym-stuff alone, but don't regret the large one bit since I can use it for other stuff as well. Great bag, great material, lots of storage and pockets for extras. No regrets, no complaints.
B005WULV4C|2|I ordered a junior's 2X because I can normally wear a junior's xlarge but since the description said \\"fitted\\" I figured I would go up one size just in case.  When the shirt came I found it to be more than fitted....my daughter who wears a junior's medium can wear it and it's actually a little tight in places!  There is NO WAY this qualifies as a 2X in even little kids sizes! The only reason I'm not sending it back is because my daughter thinks she can stretch it a little bit and wear it herself. Really disappointing because I LOVED the shirt...
B00HZS55GE|5|I love silk ties, and this tie is not only really well made but the color is so beautiful. I hate to spend a fortune on ties as they go out of style so quickly.  This tie is a great bargain,  Why spend a ton of money when this tie is just as good.
B00AWL3YHS|5|I am sooooooooooooo lucky!!!
B00A7P909U|5|I am not use to having such formal looking leggings, but I am really do like these leggings.  I love how they fit, especially in the legs ( the term wide legs does not do these leggings justice). I love these leggings for a number of reasons, and I think you will like these leggings as well.
B00CPQ4ULM|5|I have been trying forever to find a suit I like since I gain a bit of baby weight and I LOVE how this one looks and feels on me, it is the best suit I have ever bought, I am very happy with this purchase :)
B00LHZHHEY|4|nice coat.  very sporty.
B00Q9DVMTA|5|Great fit.  Light and comfortable.
B00A7QWZ1Y|4|Great find...priced well and quick shipping.  Perfect for the child that likes to layer clothing.  It isn't heavy so she won't be hot. Very cute!
B00C6W7DUU|5|Nice and perfect fit.
B00KAW8AU0|5|This is a cute, warm and well-made outfit. I was drawn to the footed pants, which are ideal for dressing little ones in cool weather. I wish footed pants for infants were more widely available.  The outfit is roomy, and i anticipate getting lots of use out of it.
B00DEWBMU8|5|Loved the bag! Everything I wanted!
B007SPKB72|5|Very nice for the price!!
B0026GOODU|5|I ordered two of the umbrella corporation patches back in mid august. estimated delivery was by October 11; not bad coming international. after I emailed the seller the following week, I received a response within 24 hours and remained in regular contact until we got the delay figured out (DSL was experiencing shipping errors) Product got shifted to USPS and arrived within three days. Product itself is great, fits perfectly on the upper Velcro panel on my ACU uniform.
B00OQG4DRU|2|i don`t like it, im disappointed of tommy hilfiger
B00BJ9UE2A|4|Everyone said it ran small so I ordered a size larger, but when it came I wish I had ordered my correct size or even a size smaller.
B00ICN23JI|5|Perfect
B000ZF0KO6|5|The shirt is a great way to show you're a fan of Firefly.  It's a great shirt.  Only down fall I ordered an X-Large and the shirt is a Large.  Not sure if the shirt's size is what the size is on Amazon but I still like the shirt.
B00BZ5SFWO|4|This costume is very cute and girly, the fabric isn't cheap at all (not like many other costumes I've bought) and it was delivered very quickly (5 days from the U.S to France). Be careful with the size though, I ordered a large one because I'm curvy but it was a bit too large and I had to do alterations.
B00HXA23VY|1|This jacket came stained
B000KWE1AS|5|Exactly what I was looking for as gifts for my co-workers.  I put their business cards inside before gifting.
B00FTV11G2|4|Needs trimming but good for Haruka.
B00LXHF932|5|5-11 and 185lbs??? Get a large. Sweet T
B00M8Z9NPI|5|thank you
B00P1IEKHK|3|Pretty but really big.
B00B498C5Q|5|This jacket exceeded expectations.  It has a solid, well-made feel and lots of nice details.  The color is a muted-red, almost brick-red.  Great value for the money.
B00P5AO7OK|4|Other than the fit, the quality and style is better than expected. So I ordered two more one size larger than my normal size - one for myself and one for a friend. I gave the smaller size to my daughter.
B003TF6LLU|5|Thanks for good product
B00MFB53KY|4|Was nice.  Material was soft and was what I expected.
B006DWABXA|2|This was my first short wig purchase, and I can say, the longer ones are much more fun. It fits and wears well, but there's really not much you can do with it. Also, the color is horribly brighter than what's pictured. It's not a soft blonde. It's almost a toxic yellow color. Way, WAY too bright!
B005HEXA60|5|The yoga pants are great!  True to size, light yet sturdy.  They look great on and are extremely comfortable for the amazing price.  I just love them!
B00FBD2G0I|4|Typical socks, at a great price. Why buy from a big box store for more money?
B00GJ0W7FQ|5|I love this jacket!
B00GN72YDA|5|I bought this for my friend as a birthday gift, and she absolutely loves it ^^
B00N4NP014|1|I wouldn't wear this sweater if someone gave it to me for free.
B00DESVZ5E|5|Great buy!
B00M1TJ766|5|I should definitely win the Ugly sweater contest with this.
B003CNRNRA|5|Love this skirt.  Haven't worn this size in years and love it.  I'm glad I checked this out.  Good price and fast delivery.  Hope to find more to buy.
B0076Q9L1U|5|Fit great, super cute with a pair of leggings for rainy days. I can't wait until winter so that I can wear it to class!
B0051U1706|5|The socks are well constructed out of an apparently strong fabric. The sock is over 60% Olefin (aka: Coolmax) and has a weave that allows &#34;breathing&#34; so they should be good as wear-alone socks in the summer. So far, they have worked well as a liner sock in cold weather - staying pretty dry themselves while allowing moisture thru to the outer sock. The fabric is not soft (my only complaint) unlike polypropylene but it seems much studier. I wear size 10 shoes and these socks are a snug but comfortable fit on me. I don't know how well they would stretch for larger sizes. I will post again if anything negative pops up.
B00MI34OUY|4|This sweater fits very nicely! However it is NOT fleece, and is actually more on the thinner side.
B00B69B6YS|4|Not that I use the ears part closed but the velcro is to low, doesn't do it's work, I will remove it If I was the designer
B00AKSD00Y|4|Seems good so far
B006SVWCXI|5|Fit true size.  Very cute - everyone said how adorable the baby looked in them and asked where I got them!
B00BAWF5BQ|3|Really pretty but had to wash it twice to get the horrible smell out of the fabric.
B005WL4Z6C|5|I was a little concerned as the marketing is aimed at females. I am a man with a bit of bicycle calfs.<br /><br />The material is a very comfortable micro fiber. They are not too tight in the calf area (unlike my very expensive Nordstrom micro fiber socks).<br /><br />The packaging says super thick. Compared to what? Other micro fiber socks, OK, yes. They are still thin so shoes are not a problem. The rubber grippers on the bottom on not like the huge knobs on the Totes winter socks.<br /><br />Yes, they are warm! Not going to replace a wool thick sock for outdoors. And I would use these as a liner in that case. I think they could easily a be a good year round sock.<br /><br />I wash my micro fiber in a machine using cold water and a delicate cycle with a bit of cold water (woolite type) liquid, and doubt the socks will have a problem being thrown in with the black micro fiber underwear.<br /><br />I got 4 pair and going back for more.<br /><br />*Update* 15 Nov 2012<br /><br />I did go back for 4 more pair (this time in black, not chocolate).  I was somehow shipped the ankle sock. I didn't realize this til I un-packed.<br /><br />The good news is my offer for a part credit was accepted. It didn't make sense to return items that cannot be re-sold.<br /><br />The not so good news is with my bicycle calfs, they are not so comfortable. The over the calf version keeps the fabric pressure more uniform. The ankle version is tall for an ankle sock. It puts too much pressure on my lower leg. I guess they will be fine for around the house no pulled up too far.<br /><br />I want to be clear I was offered a full refund and return. I though I would be a bit 'eco friendly' and make do. This is a mistake if you have heavy legs or athletic legs.
B006FDTM1E|1|they barely cover my knees they are way too tight and I wear a size 0 in jeans so obviously my legs are really thin. I wish I read the reviews before I bought them but I didn't think I had to its hard to mess up socks...
B00JE2CU7Q|5|Beautiful!!!
B002GHCF6C|5|Excellent quality that is expected of Carhart. The medium I ordered fit as it should and I am very pleased with the jacket.
B000783POS|4|I wanted a big, 4XL sweatshirt, but I missed the T (Tall) on the listing.  So I'm looking a bit short in it, but it's a good fabric and comfy. Arrived promptly.  Zipper was a little sticky but seems to be breaking in OK.
B0028Y4VZ6|4|Yes, it's a poly twill. So, no, it doesn't feel like cotton. But, yes, it *does* shed wrinkles like nobody's business and the pleats stay put w/o any ironing at all. Looks like new straight out of the dryer.    No, it doesn't have an adjustable waist (nor does it state that it does). Instead it has an elastic back waist(exactly as pictured). I wouldn't say it runs slim by any stretch, but it fit my average size 4 daughter perfectly fine.    It's nothing spectacular (hence, 4 rather than 5 stars), but it serves its' purpose EXACTLY as described just fine.
B00JPMVQR0|5|Nice suit
B007BHIO3A|5|I bought this dress for my little cousin. It took about one week to receive it. The quality of this dress is excellent, and the flower in the front of the dress is in good detail. It fits very well!
B00PZ9MEE6|5|As I mentioned in the other reviews, the shirt fits perfectly,  love the color, although,  I didn't know if my son would, however,  with a suit & tie, it looks great!
B00M49NM96|5|Really good little outfit. Panties are so cute.
B00L83VJXK|5|Very well made.  I was really impressed for the price.  My granddaughter loves it.
B004UPUFFG|3|I love it, it's cute and my baby looks 100% edible in this costume but I went to Party City one month after I got it on Amazon and it was only $20,- Now I can't return it because I don't have the bag anymore (silly me) but I'm giving three stars for the fact that I don't know how the heck this is so expensive here! When I bought it I thought it was pricey but to find it so much cheaper somewhere else made me feel like an idiot. So check in your local costume store before buying it from here!
B00MU2YQNS|5|Good
B007HOLXC6|4|I purchased this hat because of the rich, brown color to go with a dress I was wearing to a wedding the end of June. I just love wearing hats to weddings, as my mom and I used to dress up to go to the Nutcracker, plays and symphonies in downtown Seattle. My mom was one classy lady, something I try to emulate but I feel it is harder to pull off now that I am not young and cute any more! Anyways, my friends loved the look, unfortunately it was a sweltering day in the Pacific NW, totally unexpected here. Couldn't wear it very long as the humidity made it miserable. Cute even in my hand!<br />It is a true derby hat--very large and, if I had the time, I would have done something so it would have fit better/tighter even though I have an average hat size 7. There is no size to pick. It came safely box-packaged and did not require any other adjustments.<br />The detailing is beautiful and the price felt just right. I love the ease of buying through Amazon. I looked through dozens of internet sites for a hat that was right around the corner! I will be looking more to Amazon first rather than last for future party items!
B00JRBQMU0|3|I did´t like it that much, very expensive product, soft, warm, but not very flatering...
B0018P3GK2|5|Ever since I was a teenager, I've had problems finding jeans because I am not your \\"typical shape\\". I bounced around from brand to brand, style to style until I found these. These are the PERFECT fit. Very little to no gap in the back, fitted great around the legs and butt.
B0043O8KCY|1|Not true to size!
B0002LKOOE|3|I had 2 pair of these pants for several years. Very comfortable and roomy. I was very happy finding these on Amazon. But they are not made with the same material. Not as roomy as before and the material... I still have one pair from years ago (the exact same size) that I wear much more than the new shorts.
B006SRTDPW|5|way better than the than the $50. pair.
B00IYIP1GS|5|I absolutely love my Pikachu jacket, the only issue is it runs a little snug. I attached a photo as well, showing how it looks. I had also ordered a Pikachu plush back-pack which I'm holding in the picture.<br />I will continue to order from Amazon.<br /><br />~ Adrian Anxiety
B00PY3US1E|1|See through, poor quality.
B00LYTAPGA|5|Fits as expected. A lot of people complained about it being &#34;skin tight&#34;.....well yes, it is skin tight. That is the style of the shirt. It has &#34;spandex&#34; in it, of course it is going to be tight and stretchy! You definitely have to wear a cami underneath. Overall, a cute shirt!
B000VM6H40|4|in general these are good and the prices are reasonable and top dog shipped them extremely fast. Also the colo selection is good.  However, keep in mind the following:  -I ordered an XL size and it felt a bit small to me. I had to exchange it for an XXL.   -These are 50/50 (cotton/poly). They are comfortable enough, but come on, its hard to beat a 100 percent cotton one for comfort, or even an 80/20 cotton/poly.  I'm not saying it isnt comfortable. Just that a higher cotton count may have been better.     Still, i'm happy with it and I love the color.
B00CEE7VHA|2|First this is a pretty dress but the material is very cheap and scratchy but the look is indeed what is pictured, I could not find a care tag on the garment but I dare say I would be afraid to do anything besides dry clean it given the texture and quality of the fabric. Second, going by reviews I usually wear a 1 to 2 X and ordered a 4X and I can barely squeeze into it and I am 5 foot 9 and this is clearly cut for someone no tall than five foot 5. Buy this three sizes bigger than you need and be sure you are petite. A size 4X would probably fit a size 14 petite beautifully.
B002AWEYGW|5|I bought these for an 80s themed bach party and they turned out great! i originally thought there was only one glove in the package, not sure why, but there were two and they looked awesome! :)
B008BHK7WU|5|Design is very good, very thick and warm, just a bit big, but still a very good clothes, I will introduce my other friends
B00LO1VR74|5|Excellent Tshirt. soft. high quality and looks awesome.
B00K8AIWF2|3|The legs ain't long enough.
B00K28EP74|5|Great quality...delivered as promised...love this t shirt...Will order from this vendor again.. highly recommend.  Thank you.
B004KPBLOU|3|this is the only thing i ordered that fit ok.. doesn't fit out it is supposed to tho. but oh well I'm going to keep something i ordered.
B00FN9THXO|5|I bought this as a gift, my dad loves it and it fits great
B002QLE36S|4|Shirt seems to be well made, fits well and looks great!  Product was as described and I am happy with it.
B006Q0Z9QS|4|Overall, I think this is a great hat, though there are a few things that I wish were different. I was hoping it would look a little more distressed than it did, and I'm not a huge fan of the braided leather band, which appears to be glued to the hat. . I also wonder how the wire in the brim will hold up over time, and I wish the crown were just a little bit taller. The fit is a little small, which is to be expected with a leather hat. I expect it to fit my head better and better the more I wear it. Otherwise, it's comfortable, not too heavy, and seems to be very well constructed.
B00I8J0W76|1|The product detail had said that these were cotton, they were not. And way too small
B004A7YLOA|5|Great looking wallet. The stitching around the wallet and the different shades of brown really make this wallet stand out. It was bought as a gift, also comes in a recycled material tin can.
B009UOAM6Y|5|It's scary to buy clothes online, you never know if it will fit or if you will like the way it looks. I decided to take a chance and got this suit. Took it to my tailor and she wouldn't stop saying what a nice suit it was. After I got it back from the tailor and tried it on, it was perfect. I will definitely be considering this vendor for my next suit purchase.
B000WVEA7G|5|I was using a business card holder to carry my ID and credit card to work. When I needed more space, it just didn't work. I began looking for a small credit card holder, and searched extensively. I chose this one, and I am really glad I did. It fits all the cards, id and other items I need, without being bulky or stiff. It seems to be of very good quality and I am looking forward to using it for a long time.
B00ELRHFLK|5|I received multiple complements the first day I wore it. It features a great design and surprising detail, EXTREMELY recommended for a comic book fan and a fun, classy change up from the plaids and stripes. Plenty of length for a half Windsor so that's good enough for me. Initially stiff this tie folds easy and should be hung or folded when not used. Easily one of my favorites on the rack!
B006Z8HBYO|5|Perfect, perfect, and perfect! Great fit, wicking, wrinkle free and looks great!
B00TT635R6|5|I use to keep my wallet in my back pocket, but all my credit cards would get this same break across the swipe.  I think it was due to the my weight pressing down when I would sit.  So I started carrying my wallet in my front pocket.  Sadly the wallet was to big so I just started carrying the leather insert that came with my wallet.  I put a wallet insert inside and out did the job.  Recently some of the plastic inserts ripped so I had to get a new one.<br />For the price you really can't go wrong.  Quality feels better then my old one.  They are a bit bigger then my last insert so it extend a bit past the leather holding it. Doesn't bother me too much though.  I would recommend to others.
B007P296G0|5|I had hoped these socks would be lightweight, yet thick enough to protect my feet over long distance walking, and they do!!  There are two layers of material, not bulky though.  Another thing I like about them is that they do not move or sink down at the heel as I walk.  So many other socks disappear into my shoes!  These stay put, which is a huge plus.<br />I am ordering more to get me through the spring and summer months ahead.  Love these socks!!!
B002RWJ7O4|3|It was a nice purchase from Amazon. Finding large belts are tough for us big guys. The belt dis stretch over time, but the price was right for a work belt.
B004DFA3D2|1|These did not work for me -- they didn't stay on, and they were too visible with the types of ladies' shoes I need to wear them with.  They'll be visible in most types of flats and pumps.
B0008EOFM2|5|These are the only jeans my husband will wear.  He is 77 years old.  The price is good and quality is great.
B0088B8BC2|3|the style is great, the quality is above what I paid. I'm a fit guy, and this jacket is most def made for a heaver set guy. I'm going to take it to the tailor for a better fit.
B003HC8RWQ|5|In the wintertime, I wear these socks constantly in the house like slippers. Other brands just don't last on our tile floors, but these have thicker cushioned soles and are the only ones that hold up. Love 'em!
B00DV0O39U|3|not real impressed at all
B00SJ5J3KQ|5|so hard to be happy with a bra when you're an F cup.  This one is great--no gapping, easy on the shoulders.  And it's nice to ha ve more coor choices than black and white.
B00C1Z25BE|4|These bras provide a good amount of support, but I found that they ran a little large.  Even worse now, I bought these to work out and lose weight, so now they are even bigger on me since I've lost weight!  Buy with caution if you are planning on losing weight!
B007PCR2K2|1|This is one of those dresses that makes your heart break with disappointment. It looks so beautiful in the photo, but as it turns out, the silk is of such poor quality that it looks ratty even when new. The one I got was already unraveling at the seams and showing several small snags. Oh how I wish someone would re-make this dress in a quality fabric! So sad...
B00A6G42HK|5|I use to be an M size but I bought an L size and it was perfect. I love Croota Underwear
B005FBTPO6|5|These mittens are great. Perfect for the smaller hands and they stay on, which is a huge plus. I would recommend these mittens.
B004B8OFCQ|5|love it
B00VGLDBJO|2|Part of the reason I purchased these is b/c of the colors. Colors I got were not the colors displayed. Disappointed!
B008KK155Q|5|Very pleased with colour and material of this set. Bought  for a friends child and was exactly as shown in picture.Fit was lovely.
B00Q6XAKTG|5|another one for the honeymoon.  can't wait!
B00FAVYIG6|5|They are great . Soft and comfy
B006WCN606|5|OMG this beanie its perfect ... The color the way it fit. All my friends ask for it. I love roxy i bought in Brown too :)
B009RA5ZD6|1|I ordered, and got a large size.  I was shocked, I couldn't even get my arm into the sleeve.  Additionally, there was no paperwork at all, so I have no way to return it.
B004D57LX2|3|I love the colors. Nice feel and comfy material. They are thin socks, which I like but some may not.<br /><br />Only problem is that they don't stay up! they are not very tall and there is almost not elasticity at the calf. They fall down to my ankles within minutes of putting them on.
B00F4NPYN6|4|I loved the dress but it was a 1 size fits all but was too small for me. It is made for thin womwn
B0029ZAPQS|5|I was reluctant to buy Halloween costume online because majority of the time, the item doesn't look anywhere near like the picture at all. Most of the costumes look cheap with low quality material. I must say, this one beats my expectation. The material is decent for the price it worth and the cut is just right. I am extremely delighted. I recommend to buy this. And oh, it comes with cute little umbrella and the gloves as well :)
B00OZ14RCC|5|I wear this when I hit the gym and it's really great for waist shaping and I also look pretty hot in it! I didn't have confidence before but when I wear this I feel and look great.
B00K1EOK3S|5|Great deal. You can never get enough socks
B005CSOHT0|2|The legs were too long and would needed hemming.I was expecting a better fit witthout hemming. I would not order them again.
B00GUDG3I4|4|Would be more convenient with a snap closure instead of tie in back.
B001LRI4PY|5|The most rugged pair of jeans I've ever worn. Will stand up in the corner by themselves ! It will take months or even years to break them in and that's a plus for me. Not your wimpy department store jeans.
B009GRVMI2|1|super low quality leather, feels like plastic. Totally don't recommend wasting your money, get better quality for cheaper at walmart
B003VFK9V6|5|I must say they're Very comfortable. I prefer wearing these over armani exchanges pima cotton tees, they have a more comfortable feel to them without being skin tight like pima cotton clothes. Also, the V shape is an OK size- not too big but then again they're not like Banana Republic V-necks, which barely have the V.<br />Note that out of the dryer this tees shrink and have to be ironed for a proper fit (the heat stretches the cotton out).<br />Definitely will order again, most likely in black.
B007BS5O1Y|5|awesome
B00F90D67U|5|I wear this the day after  my wedding I absolutely love it and everyone else that saw me in it did aswell.  IT HAS AN EGYPTIAN FLAIR to it...so your accessories are very Important. I get everything i wore with this from Amazon. ..EVER PRETTY is the best i have three more dresses i will take to JAMAICA with me...and my family members are buying from EVER Pretty because of this.
B00DIVFVPC|5|Personally luvs this on mybabeboy!! Others also compartment on set's every time he's wear it...
B00CI1YIS4|3|I purchased Calvin Klein Baby-Boys Infant Fleece Blazer Y-Tee And Jeans, Black, 18MO and actually received what I purchased a new calvin klein outfit unlike the other outfit I purchased from this seller item # 3270032-99 ASIN : B00CI0IV2E and received a DAMAGED STAINED OUTFIT!! and am extremely upset as this was a christmas gift for my son; and its ruined. Beware of this seller although im grateful I got what I was promised on 1of 2 items I purchased from this seller I dont like those odd and would never purchase again please learn from my experience and purchase wisely especially if your on a tight budget like my family. Events like these are very hurtful.<br /><br />Greg M.
B006HF3DLU|5|I love this swimming suit.  I have never bought one online as I always have to try it on.  I have big boobs so I always have to buy a size larger to make sure I have coverage in that area.  This suit covered well and also trimmed the tummy well.  Just beautiful.  One of the best suits I have ever bought and will definately buy Reebok again.
B001O1L1RA|5|I am very happy with the sweater. I got a M but I am a Small. Make sure you get one size bigger since they do shrink after being washed but that's always expected of cotton sweater! Great price and get seller! would buy more sweater from here again.
B00LAHM77G|4|Great fit and good quality cap.  I just didn't notice the cost of shipping was almost as much as the cost of the cap which made the total amount paid a little high.  I could have bought it here locally for about the same price but I'm enjoying wearing it so I guess that's the main thing.
B00MGJORSE|5|I thought it was a purple/pink color. It's all pink. I wanted it because it looks cute with the purple in it. Its super long though. That's a plus! You can use it multiple was. I will order more because I like the length. It is thin, but not cheaply thin (if you get what I am saying)
B0020MMDXS|5|Love  this  just tried it in the store the girl had  me try it in a size under my shirt size.  I wear 3x but she gave me a 2x fit like a glove nice and snug not too tight but sucks you in in the right spots and gave  me a very nice  butt shape  lifted my boobs nice and high. This is something everyone needs.  I was snatched!
B00DTIMN00|5|After reading reviews, I bought one size bigger for my wife and phew that was a good idea. I was really worried that it may not fit, but it worked out just well. It pays to read the reviews :)
B00KCMMP86|3|I buy skinny jeans because they are the only thing that fits my skinny kid. These jeans run so big that they look like a relaxed, very baggy fit on him. Not the jeans for skinny guys.
B003O3GSVK|3|Boy is this necklace a big disappointment its so big way to big but i guess you get what they havein stock
B008X1JLDU|5|Collar is too wide.Other parts are fine.
B0043OCF98|4|Nice pair of work pants they are the right size came on time nice fitting kinda stiff  when I first got them
B00BJOHUMW|2|I purchased two pair of these pajamas and liked the fabric pattern and colors.  I washed them prior to wearing them and they were still very scratchy and stiff.  In the last few days I have washed them ten times and they are still unwearable due to being so stiff and uncomfortable.<br />In the past i have chosen Virginia,s Secret PJ's and they were great except for being pricey, the price will not be a deciding factor again.
B003ZW31LA|3|I like the t-shirt; however, even on cold water and air drying, it shrinks and does not hold its shape that well.
B004G6TA1Y|5|Its just want I was just what I was look for! It nice to have a smaller cored when charging my laptop at times.
B000H2PMBI|2|For all my other dress shirts I wear a 16 neck and 36/37 sleeve length. I ordered that size on this shirt and the neck was fine but the sleeves were a good 1 inch too short so I had to return it.
B000ORSOZ2|5|good fit close to the skin, feel nice and fresh , love the material keep's it shape, I will purchase them again..TR
B00BNU7PRC|5|it fits on my head,nice color,very good quality,it can be used in winter and summer time<br />i love this bandana im gonna order another color very soon<br /><br />thank you amazon
B005KC8NH0|5|Exactly what i was looking for.  My daughter looks great in them and they dont leave any marks on her head!!
B00MCATGMY|1|The picture of the product is a big fat lie. It looks big on the model, but the actual product looks like its meant for a child. I'm a pretty small person, but I can't even wes it. The material is incredibly cheap, it feels veey scratchy when you wear it. I wouldn't even pay $1 for this piece of trash. This doesn't even deserve 1 star
B00KQVNQQS|2|I just got this.  Wore it one time and the seams are coming apart!  Ugh!
B005GYGK2W|5|I ordered it to my wife and she loved it and sitting on it is wonderful!!!!!!in a restaurant, she looked better than all well as ever!!!!!!
B010CRU3BG|1|The XL did not fit at all like I expected. It was super tight and fit like a small. Very disappointed!
B004AH1U3A|4|The quality and fabric are very nice.  In their effort to make an attractive product they finished off the sleeves.  This looks good but when you have a 3 month old that has just discovered their hands and wants to keep their fists balled and in their mouth at all times, it is a little hard to get on.  Worth the money though and still keeps its good condition even after several washes.
B001MKTW9C|5|Great pea coat, tight threads and nice buttons.  Price was right.
B009LNBAU6|3|These are super cute! So sad that they are huge though, I just opened them and the tights are almost as tall as my daughter even though I bought  the size for her age range.
B009M83NB4|5|I have a cousin that is 4 years old and she was headed on vacation to FL, but she did have her own suitcase. This was something that she wanted before departing. When she opened the box she was overcome with joy and ready to leave for FL in that instant. Now I have request for similar items from other little cousins. Thanks for having what I need when I need it, Amazon.
B009RND8RS|3|It's fairly easy to hem the legs by folding the cuffs and sewing -- but even then the legs are longer than they need to be, and longer than I want them to be. I'm 5'5\\". Wearing them the length they were originally turns the legs into floor dusters.<br /><br />The pink fabric (with the coffee cups print) is good quality and also soft. Exactly what I wanted. However, I ordered a size up from what I thought would fit, yet even with doing that the fit isn't as roomy as I like my pj bottoms to be. It'll be interesting to see if the pj bottoms shrink when they go thru the laundry. I hope they won't. If they do, they'll be useless to me. I'll update this review if that happens.<br /><br />This would have been a five-star review if the legs weren't crazily long and if the sizing were more accurate for curvy women.
B00CV23DHM|5|Looks awesome! Boyfriend loves it.
B008X1JJ2I|5|I love this shirt :)
B00IOJBKIA|1|I hate it
B00BQM01T6|5|I love it too :-)<br />Fits as expected and she's happy to wear it. We ordered S size and it was a spot on.
B0056DK4DE|5|Very comfy, and long, as of this review I've had em over a year and they are still going strong, My favorite boxers.
B00DXD7TSW|5|Use the &#34;size chart&#34; to get the best fit. I have ~44&#34; hips, purchased an XL.<br />Purchased for a costume, specifically to function as shorts for Roller Derby, so I went with one size bigger to get better coverage. They fit nicely (just enough cheek showing), very comfortable, nice amount of stretch, mostly opaque, and the bow is adorable!<br />If you're purchasing for lingerie, looking for a little less coverage, I'd use your normal underwear size.
B009PHDXV2|4|Good quality Tees; fit was good.  Will work well for Saint Patrick's Day!!
B00936U552|4|The tie's color matches the description (purchased the burgundy). Looks nice (received several compliments) but the material feels a little cheap. The tie is slightly narrower than a regular tie, maybe an eighth of an inch, but not so narrow that it looks like a skinny tie.
B009LABUZO|5|my husband's high quality air force hat was getting very worn,  so needed to replace it. W as very pleased with this hat. It is a very high quality hat and he loved it.
B005DQCCMK|4|Very colorful, good fabric.  My son is just a bit taller than 5&#34;4&#34; so he probably would have fit better in a large.
B00NGP335A|2|I thought this would, but it didn't. So, it will end up going to Goodwill maybe!
B002G9UDYG|5|Fits perfectly and keeps you warm
B00QMF8XHO|5|Looks Great
B00UKNRSBG|4|I need a different size I got a medium but there was like two different choices you could pick in small, medium and large but now I look at it again today it doesn't show that but what our size. But the bottom and top of the rim is digging in my skin so I want to replace it with a different size
B00GXDXMPI|5|Excellent shirt ... Daughter loved it... Arrived just in time for Easter!!! Super pleased
B00FQ0ZL76|5|perfect
B0043SOH9U|5|Very happy with this shawl. It was what I was expecting.
B00NGYU8T0|5|Not see through, fits well and as expected. I would order another one.
B0018OOVPC|5|I bought 501's.  They came to me just like you would find them in a store with all the stickers on them.  I did read that one person said they were thinner.  I believe she is correct however, I would think this is the way they make them now.  I don't order too many cloths as I wear a uniform to work.  But I will order again.  I paid $49.00 or so for them.  I don't know if this is a good deal or not.
B00817DW8Q|5|Colors are just as in the picture. Durabality matches price range. Nice work shirts. What more could you ask for at this price?
B00HR0PRCC|3|details somewhat poor.
B008ENQ51S|1|These don't stay on at all. They lack the proper cut to fit properly. They are soft however.  Not happy with these for a newborn
B00CG8X6F0|5|I luv this hat....for all things involved (price, color, etc.) this was a &#34;Great&#34; choice to add to my H-D collection of apparel, cool little pocket on the side for that added touch.
B001FAYR0S|3|I was disappointed with the total price of one bracelet.
B001CO5SL4|2|The jeans had a slit in the pocket fabric a half inch. I have bought the exact jeans from Costco. And these seem substandard. The markings on the lether belt loop were wiped clean. And material a little differant. They got washed before i could return them so i will keep them. Douglas Berry
B002C5I9GI|5|I have one already an I wanted another one.  The wrong item was sent.So I accepted the order<br />an let it go at that.
B00SXFHH00|5|I accidentally bought two packs of these, but in the end I didn't regret it. My feet are women's size 7 (US) and these socks fit very comfortably. They are thin and lightweight, but I was buying these for travel so that was actually a big plus: they take up half the room in my suitcase as my other socks, so I could pack twice as many pairs! I did countless hours of walking on my trip, and the socks held up fine and didn't slip or ride down at the heel. For athletics I would choose a sock with more padding, but these will be my go-to travel socks from now on.
B00HFP7O5M|4|I'd have given it 5 stars if it had the elastic bands on the inside to tighten the pants. Other than that they look and feel great on my son.
B009VHT748|4|I like using these T-Shirts with the weather we're experiencing a little nip in the air..
B008V8MR40|5|Better quality than what I expected, very soft material. It's a thin dress but great to put over a bathing suit.
B00J3LIXTM|2|This is a cute set, super bright and fun. But unfortunately it had its downsides. The elastic around the arms was WAY too tight. They left horrible marks on her arms. The shirt itself was too short. The skirt on the other hand was way too big. so my daughter never was able to wear the outfit together. Very disappointing!
B001AKHB2E|2|Got this to use as part of a Queen of Sheba costume. I wear a size 10 and I didn't think my arms were that large. I had to expand it so much it didn't look right. Ended up wearing it as a cuff. Disappointing.
B00J2BE3CE|5|Was a birthday gift for a teenage Shemar Moore fan, and she loved it.  As soon as she opened it she put it on and it fit great !!
B00KAVHWJQ|5|Beautiful! Really nice
B006M5AJ2Q|3|Could stand to be 2 sizes larger.
B00D4KGVLU|5|Love it, I wear this jacket all the time
B007GCO7EA|4|Drawing string would have been great.  I am happy with the fabric and generous cut.
B00MK6NTM8|5|Very good quality with just the right control.
B007ETNX9K|1|I dont like this product at all! It doesnt even keep my pants flat so you can still tell that there is an adjustment to the buttons and its not tight enough to feel comfortable that it will keep the unzipped pants covered.
B008XFATEG|5|Fits good n great price
B00AM35QKE|5|Fast shipping. My kids love them!
B00GIDXFDM|4|I really like the style of this swimsuit and the fact that you get two styles for one is nice.  However, when we reverse the styles, we usually have a bit of re-tweaking to do to get the fabrics back in line which is a pain.  I bought it for my daughter's summer camp.  We live in Florida and they go to the community splash pool everyday.  The bleach from the pool has really taken it's toll on the color of the fabric and after one month it is definitely very faded.  However, this is very heavy use of the swimsuit. Had it been winter, it would probably have takes several months for this progression to happen.  Overall, I am happy with this swimsuit and, although I wouldn't buy the reversible style again, I would definitely buy another swimsuit from Laguna.
B00HHHLTDQ|5|I gave this robe to my brother (after my wife and I bought one) and he called me for weeks to thank me each time.  It's made of great quality terry cloth that feels smooth and soft.  I wear mine after each shower to remain warm and to dry off.  It is big enough to wear in a non-intimate setting.  I have mixed feelings about the hood.  One draw back for some is that this is a heavy robe.  There are matching towels that are equally great but you have to order them directly from the manufacturer in London.
B00NKWV950|5|Great t shirt.
B00EKD9MO8|1|This is a cheap dress - do not purchase!
B002OIDJ3Q|5|i looked everywhere for a ruffly pink scarf that i could throw in the wash.  this fits the bill perfectly!
B000N8RWG4|2|Ordered because I like the brand and what they make, but ran in to the issue that they made the pants a size too small, the 36 is cut like a 34.<br />If you intend to buy one of these buy a size bigger than your current size.
B000JSRPQA|1|Product sizes vary, bought two colors SAME size and they fit toally different. Amiee Growns Company did not have a phone number and never answered my MANY emails!!! BEWARE!!!
B00AM1U4R6|3|The fabric was not as nice as pictured.  And the dress did not fit as well as expected.  It's an okay casual dress, but not for a fancy night out.
B00FRO7CT6|5|The item is just as pictured - very festive and washes well despite being on the thin side.  The material is thin but works great with the baby.  Looks the same as new even though it's been washed a couple of times.
B005IUN0WM|5|this is the best thing i have ever bot its warm fits nice and snug bin wearing it every since i got it
B006X4GRQ8|1|I would give this belt zero stars if I could! I purchased it to wear as a waist belt over dresses and things of that sort. I wore this item ONE time and within two hours, it was starting to shred apart all over. So disappointed. Luckily, Amazon is amazing and when I told Customer Service about this, they immediately allowed me to return it for a full refund. If you want a belt of quality, look elsewhere!
B00E36ODK0|5|This belt is well made, is very comfortable to wear, and does not bind the waist at all. I wear it often.
B002K91RN8|5|Honestly, once you buy one, you will never wear any other bra.  It is SO comfy!!  And no...I don't own any part of the company. LOL.  I just love these bras!  I got my sister, and both my mom and mother in-law, hooked too.  :-)
B003GP00HE|5|Got a lot of complaints when I wore this for Halloween? I added black leggings under it, because it was a little short.
B001P5ZV9O|5|Great t shirt! I would definitely buy more of this product.  Bought this as a gift and it was very fast shipping as well.
B0007IQF0Y|5|This product is such a high value. The quality is superb and the size and compartments are perfectly proportioned for man pockets. I would suggest this item to my best friends.
B005CIX54S|5|This thing is truly slim and keeps all my important cards in there with some cash that I occasionally carry.  My only complaint is the slightly ugly &#34;Slimmy&#34; logo on the outside that seems childish and cheap.
B005F95SNK|5|This is just great! It was exactly what I was looking for and at a fair price as well. I highly recommend this product.
B00CB3B6H0|4|Gave it to a friend for Christmas.  He loved it.
B00NX9NHJ6|5|Fit is good and style is great for wearing those boots you wanna show off more than your outfit.  Fleece lining is comfy and soft.
B00JAX136S|5|I purchased this coat for my 10 year old daughter.  She loves it.  She normally wears a size 10, but I ordered a 14 since it runs small.
B0030BZVJG|1|I ordered this as a gift for my niece. The silk screening was not done properly. Too much white ink was used and it flowed over the orange outlines and left ugly white blobs. I contacted the vendor via email a week ago and have not yet gotten a reply.
B010C7WZ8U|5|The shirt is great. Fits nice, arrived on time and is made of good material (not cheap and thin).
B0076RQLSU|3|This dress seems like it is good quality, and there is nothing wrong with it at all. I personally found it to be a bit too big for the size I ordered, but other reviews feel that it's too small in fit, so I think it's just a body shape/expectation issue. The sleeves especially seemed a bit loose.<br /><br />I personally didn't find it very slimming. The loose, light fabric rather emphasized my stomach quite a lot. The cut of the dress is fine, stretch always does that for me and I should have looked at that in the description. But it really wasn't slimming per description. Also, the green is a bit brighter than the picture shows.<br /><br />This would be a cute, light, wonderful summer dress for the right body shape, just know what works for you! There's nothing wrong with the dress itself. My problem is that I thought it would be similar to the same company's \\"Slimming Rockabilly Peasant Dress\\". That dress arrived at the same time and *is* incredibly slimming. So if you're getting it for the similarity, it's *not* similar in fit! They are totally different dresses!
B00MQJUHII|5|Very attractive and feminine cut. Fits small and ordered 1 size up based on all reviews and am happy with the fit.
B0002DD14C|5|Unfortunately I never received the product I purchased.  The company claimed that they sent via USPS and I never received it.  So as far as the company is concerned I am out of the money I spent, plus the product.  I have received no satisfaction.
B00F6E9T5M|5|No more compromise! I have never been happier with a swimsuit top. It is incredibly supportive (wave tested!) without being constraining. The underwire is completely comfortable and discreet. The colors are fun and bright! I absolutely recommend for anyone that has a hard time finding something that is both supportive and flattering. I've never ordered a swimsuit online before, but I went out on a limb based on the reviews and was not disappointed!
B00AARJKJA|5|Nothing to complain about.  Fits nice, made well, priced right.
B0081U3TYK|5|Love it...lots of glitter.
B00BV1Z5DE|4|it's heavier than i thought, but it worth it!
B007IRVVMY|5|My daughter wants to wear the hat everyday regardless of the weather.  Pants are thick and should be listed as outerwear but very cute in either case.
B00847H4AK|5|Love these socks. Very low cost. These dress socks look nice and are thin. I like thin socks. I am not sure how durable they are yet, but so far so good.
B00CRX7CE0|3|Meh. For the price, it worked. Should have included gloves to complete the costume. Overall, wasn't awesome but wasn't bad either.
B00IWM7TKW|5|These are the BEST!
B000N8RXG8|4|Nice to have a heavy-weight cotton shirt but this is a little bit too long to wear untucked.  I'm normally a large t-shirt wearing guy.  This shirt, if left untucked, is covering pants pockets.  I've washed it and it hasn't shrunk much.  I'm afraid to try a medium.<br /><br />I've tried Carhartt shirts before too.  Some fit fine in a large and some are made for the very, very tall.  I like the heavy feel of the cotton.  I just wish it was shorter.
B00M3BD1ZA|1|Electrons are negatively charged. Soooo if you get more of them, that would make you...
B00IIK71RO|5|I wore them for a neon black light party, and they glowed like crazy. Loved them.
B00L1QRU9Q|2|These pants run smaller than the size chart
B000NV5G4G|2|Fast shipping, but was not what I was expecting.  I thought that these leggings could be used for exercising, but they are more for fashion.  Description should detail this.
B000UJCK7M|5|for the money you could not get a better deal!  great fit and it was excellent quality and material.  stayed the way it looks all nite long and i dance -- a whole lot!!  wonderful.  many compliments.  thanks.
B00E70ZFH2|3|running pants? they pull everything in and leave very little to the imagination. if your genitals need a hug buy these baby's
B00DYP7272|1|DARK COLOR NOT HOW IT LOOKS IN THE STORE SO YOU CAN TRY ON.  BETTER TO BUY IN STORE. ITS RUNNING SMALL.
B00BPIOB56|5|I love this blanket.  Unfortunately, my daughter won't wear it any more, since she wants to be totally independent now (she's 2 1/2)  It is very good quality, soft, launders well, and nice and roomy for the legs. Just dry it on low, or better yet, hang it dry in a warm spot.  I recommend these blankets since they are big enough to last a few years, and won't fall off as your child turns over.  Just be prepared for when your kid voices her/his OWN opinion about having legs constrained!
B0035WTMF4|5|I had a baby and went up two cup sizes (was already busty before), and this is the only bra that provided support while still being comfortable. I finally took the time to write a review since this is my third time purchasing two in size 36F. Try it, you'll see...
B00G71LUXC|3|XL should fit generously but was small in the arms.  Order an XXL if you want a standard fit
B000H699FO|2|the chimes were falling apart , as soon as I unpacked them,  Thhey were not made  to keep them together and secure
B005FOLQYA|4|This dress is easy to ware and wash I love it. The dress comes in two nice colors you can buy one or both
B000A38K2C|4|The sleeves are a little tight for me. For a man with large arms this might not fit well.
B00A13EVWE|2|Quality is bad and does not fit well.
B0041OFBNC|4|Looks exactly the way I expected it to. Thick fabric gets warm quickly. So, plan on fall and winter costume parties only.
B0063UIGZW|5|GeekBuying brings you must-have tech products and accessories at amazing prices. Pay with PayPal this summer and you’ll enjoy even more savings.
B00C2YWOC4|5|Had to reorder a smaller size.  Nice jacket, but I feel it runs large.
B00FHO6WPQ|5|This is perfect! Relates to image as expected, fits me just like the model in picture, and it's very comfortable. It arrived within 2 was after I ordered it (Dec. 12). That's pretty early because product's shipping deadline was for 1st or 2nd week in January. Fast delivery was awesome! I opened it from package & mother was a bit envious. She asked where I got it & I told her ordered it from Allegra K & the price was very reasonable and worth buying. I got great compliments of it at college. This is wonderful. I am a satisfied customer & will continue to shop at Allegra K.
B006T8VUYW|5|Comfortable, nice, elegant.... these are some words that could describe this swinsuit!!!! I have never found something like this before!!! I believe this is my best purchase ever!!! :)
B00DLK1IVQ|5|I love the dress. Bought size based on size chart.  Only problem is one arm hole very slightly snug. May have to correct that.  My arms are not that big.  Otherwise, love and will buy other colors.
B00LTMDET2|5|Niceeeeee
B00A8PJBRA|5|Daughter very pleased. Used them in Chicago in winter. Sent very happy picture enjoying socks. Arrived in time for Christmas.
B005SI4P7I|5|they are perfect my wife love it
B00HWFAHK4|3|I was looking for a running/workout top that is fitted, but this is not it.  The shape is kind of boxy and not very flattering.  The color was nice and bright like the photo, but the fit disappointed so I'm sending back.
B00KD9ABCU|5|Very cute, we've gotten many compliments on this dress. Bottoms are huge, dress fits well. Royal blue is hard to match with coordinating boys outfit, FYI.
B0080PNLYY|5|This jacket was just what we needed! It is thick and warm and fits my 4 year old daughter perfectly. Great Value, great Item :)
B004IUPM9W|5|I bought this on a whim. It turned out to be a great decision. My wife has a small frame, and big breasts. She looks incredibly sexy in this chemise. It's a very simple little piece of fabric, but it works very well.
B008XCNRFC|4|I'm in Chicago and 27 weeks along (look like 36 weeks along) but still have extra room, two inches or so left. It's warm, but not too puffy. I did notice my tummy is higher than where the waist is in the coat but I'm 5'9&#34; so not very proportional especially during pregnancy.
B006L3V5ZO|4|The socks were a geat fit. I would definitely buy another pack. They stay nice and hidden with my flats.
B000MND796|5|I like it very much.
B00CC0HZ40|5|Excellent!!!!!
B00S6ZT7FU|1|is not the pants at the picture ...
B00OFZU6GO|3|top is slightly big but not enough to pay the same amount it was to buy, to return it... good thing I know how to sew. Other then the top being big the dress is a very nice one.
B00FPKO0XS|3|Larger than I expected and I think it may be a bit warm in the sun as it is essentially polyester and doesn't breath. But the shirt is comfy.
B002AHY5ZM|5|Love the color and pants!  One of my favorite brands because your pants stay up during busy shifts!
B00J2FGE9A|5|It looks good on me
B009720MIW|5|I love these socks. They go on easily, stay up and are not too tight around the toes. I would buy them again.
B00GTCWA0G|4|Very pretty though runs a lil small
B00IDTN340|1|I ordered three shirts all in the same size and the same brand. Only one fit like expected. The other two were clearly not the size advertised, and had to be mislabeled because they were so far off the size that it was ridiculous!
B00IIZANUQ|1|the pants are too tight around hip and bottom area
B003XFRJDU|5|So cute. The little boy I bought it for loves it!
B00MEZPP2C|5|Great Seller, Great Product, great price!!!!
B00L5O3VGK|5|The perfect Halloween Costume.
B007M8S1Q8|5|Ordered these to wear with the 2 Piece Polka Dotty Dress and they were perfect!  You can even wear them over boots if you're in a colder climate as I am.
B0006N5UQ0|3|Don't buy the ones with \\"modal\\" though, they take too long to dry and tend to ball up.  I buy the ones with tactel (I think that's what it's called).  I've been wearing these for years.  I don't put them in the dryer, I hang them dry.  The string bikini cut is hard to find--have to order online or go to an outlet store.  I'm not a thong underwear kind of person so this is the next best thing.
B001PULAJ4|5|this bow tie tied together my 11th costume rather nicely (yuck yuck yuck), also is good for just having a classy evening in, harumph!
B00WUM5CU4|5|My baby girl love it
B00NQTR11I|4|Super cute and very well made. Just wish they were a little less expensive.
B00366BTR8|4|i mean its nice , for the price i had about one silky one and a sexy black one that i really like the color choice was amazing tho .
B00OBSTTJA|3|This product fit well.  The problem that I had was that on the 3rd laundering the embroidered trim on one sleeve came away from the fabric.
B00O7Y4VVE|4|Finally something that works well with my hair!
B00DZKXTGE|5|These are great shirts!! I live in Ft Lauderdale and these shirts breathe and don't allow excess perspiration. My go to shirt for the golf course or a casual night out.
B00GRAMDNY|5|Very comfortable and was well received at the party that I bought it for.
B007P1JFB2|3|these gloves looked great however they were too large.
B00JRD7VPI|3|Great dress but completely see through! Use as a bathing suit cover or wear a slip
B001CGPMQI|5|it is a absolute delite this pants i just hope to get shorts like that totally awesome
B00I1AJALQ|5|Lovely cut and color. Love the fit of this lightweight flannel. I can wear another tee shirt level layer underneath. I want more of these in different colors.
B00BH0NWY8|3|I didn't even get the chance to use this product. The Size didn't fit true to the label. So as a result had to send it back. The costume looked great. Although it was a remedial thing to hook the top and pants together and make it a once piece. and instead of a fake button shirt, it should of been just a button up shirt.  The ears that came with the Costume were broken. So I recommend getting your own set of ears<br /><br />I would recommend to your friend if he is a bit thin or of an athletic build. unfortunately buff people, and Plus size people will have a really tough time fitting in it.
B00IFXUAA4|5|great
B0098JUL0S|1|I HAVE TO BE HONEST I WAS VERY VERY DISAPOINTED IN THIS COMPANY WAAAAY TO SMALL AND BADLY DESIGNED
B008K81LI4|4|Nice and comfy
B0050N22BW|4|I bought this hoody because I can't wear the [[ASIN:B004KTMRE4 Patagonia Hooded Monk Sweatshirt]] all the time ;-) Compared to that sweater, the Mammut hoody feels a bit heavier & warmer and has a much narrower cut overall. Plus, the collar is super tight; my head barely fits through it and it's pretty stiff. I don't think I bought it too small; I have both hoodies in M and the sleeves of a Mammut hoody are plenty long. Still I might try an L next time.<br /><br />I'm also not too enthusiastic about the print on the back of the hoody. I couldn't find a picture of the back before ordering; I'll try to upload one here later.
B00I7M0Y2M|5|I live at the beach and this is a perfect dress to wear to work with wedge sandals or on the weekend with flip flops.  Very comfortable!
B007GCKD4I|5|Excellent product, as I expected, right color, smoth cloth, bit long but not a problem with that (I´m not that tall)Thank you.
B00KGEMXP0|3|Comfortable feel.  I like the color and price just with the pouch was bigger
B00C6VDXLE|5|Despite the jeggings name, these are what skinny jeans were meant to be.  They have the belt loops and zipper, unlike most jeggings.  They are skin tight down to the ankles (OK, they're not quite as tight at the ankles; the only style tighter requires an ankle zipper, which would be fantastic on these).  They are stretchy and soft, but still denim, not some hole-prone knit, and the quality is excellent for the price (especially if you get the sale price of about $15).  If you want tight, you want these.  My only complaint is the very low rise (I prefer mid rise), but they have Long, which is fantastic!  You'll trun heads and step on tongues with these!<br /><br />Update: I originally bought my normal size, but these have enough stretch that I bought some a size smaller.  They are super fantastic, except that I have split three in the crotch.  OK, so I like them TIGHT.  You can use the stairs to shimmy into them, but don't try doing splits to get them all the way on.
B00AYQS6FG|5|good quality for the price.
B0002TUJR8|5|I bought this to hopefully hide my beer belly at a recent event. It was very difficult to put it on and my wife had to help me get it off. (hilarity ensured.)<br />Once I got the undershirt on, I looked 17% less fat than I really am.
B004ETIA3C|4|This bra is attractive and comfortable. In fact, I turned it into a nursing style bra and like it better than most of the ones I purchased as nursing bras. I find that it could have a little more support at sides and along bottom of my breasts. I wear a 34F and feel like it leaves me with slightly sagging boobs. But it is much better than all other soft/cupless bras I've tried. Its also made of a nice sturdy material that is very soft to wear, no itchy lace here. Would recommend to other large chested ladies.
B00KBLD24O|5|beautiful color, soft material sized perfectly
B00LAUI8D0|5|No need to iron it, soft material, fit perfectly. Wish there were other colors.
B00LUMAHUU|5|Very nice material, well cut and quite comfortable.
B00AT0N5RG|4|My kid says to me these:<br />The head band to me was nice here is the pros and cons<br /><br />Pros:The good things of the is product is that the fabric was nice, the metal was also flexible, and the look is cool<br /><br />Con: The bad thing was that the smell of the head band smelled weird, and to me that is the only con of this product.
B004YVF9BG|5|I really like this shirt. I bought it for one of my niece's for a birthday present. It's the perfect size and it's really soft. I love the zipper too.
B00ISBD1LI|5|Ordered these shorts on a whim.  Thought they might be ok for work or just lounging around.  I received them today.  I m a size 7, so I ordered the 8 they fit perfectly and feel so comfortable.  I ordered the only other color in my size.  I m very pleased.
B00GELITTS|5|This dress is a beautiful greenish blue color and a fabulous fit. This dress is very flattering! I highly recommend!
B004K3VPAM|4|I really liked the design and will be ordered the pink ones probably.  The tops were a little tight and I am not a large girl, but it was an easy fix.  I cut off the top and just wear with a garter belt.  Very shipping too!
B00VSQZL90|1|This is not true adult sizes the size was more likely to fit a teenager than a woman. You have to get a size larger than what you are.
B001NQSHTQ|3|It's OK, as displayer.
B006EXMBFY|5|I have never felt fabric this soft. Love it for the little guy, and how convenient it is for quick nighttime changes (no snaps in the dark!). Yes, your baby will probably grow out of it super fast like all his or her baby clothes. I just wish they made larger sizes.
B004UUDVVQ|5|We loved this outfit. The size fit perfectly. My husband wore it at 35+ degrees for outside fun and inside. He was comfortable, did not get hot, and he was the best looking pirate of the bunch. Having such a great experience with the product, we will order our Halloween costume from California Costumes.
B0038MLZVA|4|I like it but it runs a little small
B00V5YQ7S4|5|size fit and color on all items were geat
B00A6SORHS|5|Excellent seller! Fit as expected!
B00917P6HA|2|Too Large, material way too thin, like paper thin. Gave them to my sister.
B00BPW5WY6|2|I don't know what they used on this material but It has a strong chemical smell. I have washed it 10 times already and it still smells. I read the review from another customer who gave a solution and I will try it. But if it doesn't work I will be tossing it. That will be a waste of money but I can't stand the smell. Other than that I actually liked the nightgown.
B000U69OUQ|3|I love these, they're so pretty and sexy, but I wish they were like the thigh highs that VS has, where there is rubber on the inside of the top so it doesn't slide down on you...  Other than that, which doesn't happen often, I love them!  I LOVE ANYTHING PINK!!!!!!
B0026RHF08|2|Of course after seeing this sexy teddy....I had to have it~! I ordered the small/medium since I am thin with large breasts. The teddy doesn't fit right! It's way too big and the material that is attaching the top and panties has gaps....I'm six feet tall and figured it would stretch nicely. Very disappointed. Especially since I can't return it.<br /><br />Save your money and go to Victoria's Secret.
B00377V5SO|5|These briefs are controlling without cutting off your air supply.  I work in an office and again, these are controlling, but don't show lines with my work pants.  True to size and wash very well.  Lovin these!
B00KY4XZIG|5|Very nice and fits perfectly
B00378LDGC|5|This is the best fitting, most comfortable bra I have ever had on. You really don't even feel like you are wearing a bra. No pinching, poking, riding up, and the hooks don't dig into your back. The fabric is smooth and feels soft against your skin. You can adjust your shoulder straps from the front while you are wearing it. All this and it is very figure flattering. I can only hope that they never discontinue it. The perfect bra...
B00BG461MU|3|Like a Geeky girl I'm an apple shape and bought this dress thinking it would provide the illusion of curves. It's okay but not great. It fits closely and is not lined so beware if u have a tummy.
B003JFK86O|5|Purchased this for my grand-daughter and was so pleased with the quality, sizing, and style!  The fabric drapes beautifully and looks great after many washings and dryings.  I purchased another style dress from the same company and find the quality was the same.  Will definitely purchase more Bonnie Baby outfits!
B00M8RGC5K|2|This looks so cute on the model but when I put it on... I think it looks like I am wearing a decorative diaper. I was really disappointed in how it looks/fits on me.
B00HFFJPMM|4|Runs small for my daughter's usual size.
B007W2QYM2|5|it does look very sexy and sexy! the quality is quite all right, but seems like it runs just a little to small.
B00E6MH6QE|5|They fit great. Size chart was on point. They feel wonderful, fit fantastic. The entire line of Jones of New York has not let me down to date. Would order in other colors. Great buy.
B005LAMB92|5|Love it ! Was a gift so he loves it too!
B007IRL8VI|5|I bought this Puma cap for my uncle as a birthday gift... and he really loves it!..I see him wear it a lot. He even wants another one for back-up.
B002HS87W6|2|Tops run very big. I bought an extra small which is my normal size,  but it is way to big. I was disappointed because i can't even order a size smaller.
B008SAAG7G|4|It got here pretty fast. It's not much of a good waist trailer but it does what it can. I like it. I wear it in my sleep and it feels fine.
B00FPKVN8S|4|Item does run small but stretches quite a bit.
B00F0VKRZ2|5|Perfect
B00AQKFN56|3|Was not as good as I had hoped for.  Fits a little lose.
B00DJNU79Y|5|Great tights! Super cute. The spots are velvet so they kept sticking to the inside of my dress but definitely a good buy!
B00FVREEA4|5|Love them but I had to cut the extremely scratchy tag. Out of the back.
B00FY9R7AI|5|Generous fit, soft cotton.  Wonderful sleepshirt.
B003LXWHBI|2|While it appears nice this cap was entirely too large for my son..and husband who tried to see if it was just for adults
B00JN58TPQ|5|My son looks really nice wearing this outfit and I was relieved to find out the pants are adjustable since my son is tall and skinny
B003ZW1AEU|5|These are some of the most comfy pants I've ever bought! they make your legs look great, and most importantly,    THEY'RE NOT SEE THROUGH! I have larger thighs (and butt) so I was very worried that they wouldn't fit... I'm so glad I bought these!
B003WU34T4|4|As a woman over 50 with actual hips, it can be difficult to find underwear that's not &#34;old lady&#34; granny panties. However, these come in fun patterns and colors. I am somewhat between sizes, so I bought the larger size. It is a teeny, tiny bit loose, but I prefer that to too tight, which shows every bulge. They are smooth. They stay in place. They are a decent price, although I bought a pair at TJ Maxx for $2.99. Problem is, TJ Maxx doesn't have all the colors, patterns and sizes available. So the extra money was worth it. I think I now have 6 or 7 of these and I am happy.  I washed them and did not find any shrinkage.
B00N54S424|4|Love it. It has good coverage and fits well too.
B005SVJSNQ|5|Great tie. Good color and it has a nice crisp look that I like. The colors are very vibrant so if you don't want to stand out then look for another tie.
B003JO89O8|5|Very happy
B00M9KKIC4|5|My son loves them!!
B00O64EHLO|5|Very pretty. Nice colors. For the price point it's well made, what you would expect, my daughter really likes it.
B005U8NYIW|2|I received my product very quickly and the shorts were in good condition. However, they are cheap. That's the only word I can use to describe the material. They are so thin that I can't imagine they will last very long. My thighs are somewhat large which is the reason I was purchasing compression shorts in the first place. These things are so flimsy that they would never stay down over my legs during running or other exercise. I would not call them &#34;compression&#34; shorts at all. I do not recommend purchasing this product. Spend a little more and get some good shorts that will do the job you intended.
B005NJXOT2|5|So glad to find a long, straight, no frills maxi skirt!  Can't find anything like this in a store.  Goes with almost everything.
B0050FZ3IE|5|Warm, comfortable, fleece.
B00A04CHZ2|5|Nice size wallet and thin as well. Great choice!!
B004M17JO8|2|I was a pre-pregnancy size 10 have found myself to need Mediums in some maternity pants, and Larges in others. So, based on the reviews, I ordered the Large in these. Apparently I should have ordered an X-Large. Ridiculous. They run wayyyyyyy small. Not only that, but the elastic waistband in the front is very thick and stiff, so it cuts into my belly, which looks and feels terrible. And, the adjustable elastic band in the back (which I won't ever use since the pants are so small) is accompanied by plastic buttons on each side, that cut into my hips. I'm only 13 weeks along, so pretty soon I imagine I won't even be able to wear these pants at all. And at the price I paid, I'm disappointed.
B001G2U8B2|5|I am totally satisfied with my hat.  It shipped very quickly.  I will enjoy it for a long time to come!
B001V4XKGA|5|THE BOOTS FIT PERFECT & LOOK VERY NICE!!
B00HYWPC00|3|It's a great price and fast shipping. I will now have enough gloves to last the winter for my 6 year old son that always losses his!
B00AM16ZE2|5|I now have this style of Columbia fleece jacket in three colors - pale aqua blue, black and red hibiscus.  Just love this color!  It's a very bright, nearly neon, orange red, but it's very pretty.  You will definitely not get lost in a crowd wearing this.  The style is just superb - fits great (a little fitted, which I prefer - I don't want anything that looks like a man's jacket),  very cozy and warm.  During these COLD winter days in the Midwest, I wear it as a liner underneath my down jacket (and the rest of the day - it looks nice enough to wear in the office), but when the temperature eases up a little, it's all you need. You can also throw it in the washer and dryer, and it holds up nicely - the fabric doesn't pill or get worn looking - not sure if you're supposed to do that, but it works for me.  I also got this on sale, so - double happy!
B008N6Y5OA|5|I'm very happy with the high quality of  workmanship of this Southpole  Junior's pullover.. Its medium weight so I can wear it any season. The design is embossed, and eye catching!  I  Love it!
B00FJ9SQ0I|5|Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He's had one similar for years that he wears all the time and could never find another like it. In the stores they are always either way too thin or really expensive. This was great quality at a reasonable price. Will probably buy another in a different color!
B00NMBMPHK|5|Awesome shirt, love it!
B00B6EAKN6|5|Decent pants - good for work in restaurants. Nice style but easily cared for.
B007KFQI1I|4|Really nice shirt.
B00PPYSBG6|1|I order size xxl and they fit like a larger....can't put nothing in the pockets without it falling out....so I wouldn't recommend anybody buying these pants!
B00YSGQ8WG|1|Material is cheap. Shipped from China and took forever. I wanted them to be comfy and baggy so I got a large but they are tight. The design looks silly when stretched. I normally wear a medium.
B00D7A2G3O|2|They were super cute when they arrived but they did not hold up well, after a month of occasional wear there was a hole in the foot and not even by a seam, just in the fabric.
B001B0X81G|4|So warm and slightly tight that I only wear it during artic air. It is warm!
B00ITMHL2Q|5|These pants are soft and comfy. Great for yoga or lounging. I am sure I will purchase more in the future.
B000THHBBU|4|Overall this was a great costume.  Very comfortable to wear and flattering fit.  At first I thought the cape was sewn to the dress, but to my surprise it is attached with velcro!  I found this to be a good feature in case the cape got to be annoying, or you want to throw a jacket on over the costume you can remove the cape and re-attach easily.  The gauntlets fit pretty well, they would fall down once in awhile, but it was not bothersome to me.  My only complaints are that the costume was rather short on me and my behind was BARELY covered.  (I'm 5\\"8\\")  I recommend buying cotton leggings for this costume. I ended up not using the mask that came with it or the boot tops.  The mask has an elastic band that velcros in the back, and when I tried it on it kept literally flying off my face because it was too small.  The boot tops weren't a problem, I already have a few pairs of knee boots and didn't see the sense in using them.  I give this costume 4/5.  I didn't use the mask or boot tops, but really you get a lot in this costume and the price was pretty cheap.  I felt comfortable all night in this costume.  It did not cling to my skin and fit nicely in all the right places.  I wear a size 16 typically and I would say this fit a little loose and an 18/20 would def be able to wear this comfortably.  It would probably be pretty baggy on a size 14.
B00P8KS9DC|2|It's just weird... cheaply made and oddly shaped.
B00CE3ISLE|4|Gift for grand son
B00JD41TT0|5|Love it!!!
B001ELJMOE|5|I used to wear Eddie Bauer knit boxers, but they only sell white now, which I don't like, so I had to find an alternative.  I tried both Ralph Lauren and these Tommy Hilfiger boxers.  These are my favorites.  They are a bit heavier, and the waistband is more comfortable.  They are very soft and the length is good.  I will continue to buy these as long as they remain available.  The price on Amazon is just right (roughly half the list price).
B00QCCLA1S|4|It's a good qaulity for the price
B0010W39QY|5|This bra is so great that it has become my go-to bra. It is the only strapless bra that I have ever purchased that actually stays in place all day long. It also reduces the size of your breast greatly.  You will not regret this purchase.
B00SGHS4A2|1|Terribly small- fits my kid 7yr old daughter) not me. Im a size 12 :(
B00C5KKSD2|5|Love them, they fit perfect. Could have been a little shorter, but petite is to short. Would order another pair.
B00ENGSEWS|5|Exactly what I was expecting. Delivered in two days, as promised.
B0002BL59C|4|Travelpro, if I'm to believe what I read on the internet, is known for sturdy functional luggage, at least their higher end lines, like Crew5.  I don't travel much so haven't put this bag through extreme paces, so most of what I say simply summarizes my internet research, which you are welcome to repeat.  I did, however measure this bag myself with my own tape measure, and I didn't see an actual measurement of this particular size anywhere else.   <br />     I found plenty of reviews online that rate the durability of this line of luggage as high, including a great article about carry-ons at travelinsider.com.  (As this article notes, however, if you really want a lifetime warranty worth something, you'll have to buy Briggs & Riley.)  There are plenty of pockets and organizing aids without getting in the way of the available space.  Besides not meeting the Briggs & Riley warranty standard, which is forgivable in my book, I mark this bag down for lack of truth in (size) advertising, a sin which Briggs & Riley is also guilty of, again according to my internet research.   <br />     So, BEWARE if you are traveling internationally or in airlines with strict baggage dimension restrictions.  This bag is billed as 9X14X18, but is closer to 10X15X20 (including wheels and \\"foot\\"), and that is without unzipping the expansion zipper, which adds another 3 inches or so.  The 9 inch dimension is possible if you don't fill the bag full and squash down the lid.  14 inches is not achievable.  I measured 14 11/16 inches edge to edge.  The next larger rollaboard in this line, the 20\\", easily exceeds the common 45 linear inches limit.  I chose this size because I'm okay on almost all domestic US flights.  And it's well-built enough to check if I have to or want to. <br />
B00BMD8H8Q|3|This is a very cute shirt but after I wore it once it shrank considerably.
B009RAEVX6|3|Sleeves too tight, chest is ok, but an XL is usually a little looser than this. Color is good, drape and fabric good. Order up ifs unsure.
B00FMZF0JY|3|I got an Amazon gift card as a present and really wanted to treat myself to something special. We always have house guests and I realized I never wake up in anything nice enough for company. I really liked the print and was hopeful to like the simple cotton material (I didn't want flannel, instead cotton for year round). Sadly, they are a bit baggie (S) and I feel rather frumpy in them. Also the material is beyond uncomfortable. I have washed them multiple times to try and &#34;break them in&#34; but they are still so crisp.<br /><br />Overall they are cute from everyone else's perspective. If you're searching for the ultimate in comfort, these aren't!
B00HCS7JQQ|5|Awesome!!!!
B00V9MP5S0|4|I really like the feel of the skirt on, the way it hugs my mid section area, and the feel of material against the skin.  It seems a quality product that will hold up to washing.
B00GGL6K92|5|This bra fits so comfortably that two days later,I ordered two more. I'm a middle aged woman who cannot find a comfortable bra anywhere. I was tired of buying,trying,and hating the bras I thought would work. This is such a great find, that I had to get more.Hopefully,they won't discontinue this style.I would hate to have to search for a replacement.
B00AOIA27O|3|This shirt looks and feels great and it would have been awfully cool had it actually fit. I'll say it's a good 4-5 stars had it fit. I gave 3 stars because it is really a nice shirt and I won't bash it just for the fit. Really had I been in a physical store I would have searched for one that fit. I'm a rather large person and to put this in perspective, for long-sleeve dress shirts I purchase 18 34/35, an 18 1/2 34/35 also works. I purchased this shirt as an X-Large but it was way too tight - probably would fit someone with a 16 1/2 or smaller neck size - from a long-sleeve dress shirt perspective. So for me, I'm not even sure if an XX-Large would fit, which is a shame because I like it enough that I won't return it but will find someone to give this as a gift.
B0030XOYRO|3|Parts were too large (pants and jacket) while the vest was short but really wide.  I had to return it.
B00FIXJIZW|5|LOVE IT!!
B00JYBYBXS|5|Excelent
B006QHMVFS|2|Material very bad , size are fit
B007OUFO5K|5|***Update July 30*** I ordered the caramel in size 6, and I believe they are mislabeled. I have caramel in size 8, and that's how the 6 fits. I am returning them. I hope it was a fluke, as I have two other colors in size 6 on the way.***<br /><br />Originally got 2 pairs at Boscovs. Happened to find them on Amazon and I was too lazy to go back to the mall, so I bought two more colors here and now I'm thinking about filling out the palette. I love the way these fit -- close, but not tight. They do have a little bit of stretch. I don't have much in the way of hips and these fit me perfectly there, so the curvier girl is likely to be disappointed. Otherwise, I would say these are fairly true to size.<br /><br />One downside: For work, they do need to be ironed, even if I'm quick to get them out of the dryer. If I didn't wear them to work, I probably wouldn't bother though.<br /><br />Regular length in size 6 is fine for me (5'7\\"); the inseam is between 31.5\\" and 32\\".<br /><br />One more opinion on size: If you're between sizes, I would not hesitate to order up, as they can be a bit snug in the thigh. I have 6s and 8s, and while I prefer the fit of 6s, the 8s look okay too (more \\"relaxed\\" perhaps). The waist is a bit loose, but not obviously so. I prefer a belt with those, but I don't strictly need one.
B0027E381U|4|While the quality is really nice, it's a tad too small. It fits fine but I'd like it better if it didnt slip off my head so easily.
B000M8T9BG|5|I don't usually write reviews about men's underpants, but Amazon has put me to task, so I'll do my best.  Over the years I've found the trunk to be the perfect length. Not too geaky briefy, or too long as to bunch beneath a pair of jeans. These have a sleak feel, no doubt due to the 9% Dow XLA lastal/polyolefine. The 91% Hong Kong cotton adds the necessary softness and the snug, yet comfortable band rounds out this near perfect pair of skivvies.
B0002X0RDU|3|The pants are comfortable, neither too thin nor too thick, nice material, just about what I wanted. I bought them for $14.99, I guess it's a little bit overpriced.
B007ZPTENM|5|My husband purchased this shirt for me and it fit perfectly.  It is soft and comfortable and did not shrink after washing.
B004U0IRGU|5|For as cheap as they were, very nice set of gloves. However, the shipping took 3 days after my expectations(well, what it said) which angered me, buuut its all around a good buy ive been gloving non stop outside at night people can see it for hundreds of feat as how bright they are.!
B007ULQ3NA|4|I have been looking for a retro-ish bathing suit for a while. I got the navy blue one and I LOVE it. It fits pretty great. Except I feel like it's a little big in the crotch area, but only a little, and probably only visible to me! All in all it's a great buy!
B00LVPDXBQ|5|Too small
B00HVLC5UY|1|I did not realize the texture of the material of this dress. I felt like a baby doll or a 5 year old getting ready for Easter pictures. Perhaps it would be cute on some, but it was not for me.
B00LI0SYWC|5|Fits as expected, it's meant to be large as opposed to fitting.
B000U6AE14|5|These are a rare find, well at least where I live.  I love the open bottom and of course pockets are a must.  I only put my hands in the pockets so I don't know how they store stuff and the fit is perfect.  I am 5' 4&#34; length is great for me.  Glad I am not tall.  Wanted something to hang out in the winter and even have traveled in them.  Comfy
B00CS0QTTQ|4|This sweater fit awesome! Don't dry in high heat or it will shrink. Low heat delicate does the trick. It has the appearance of being dual layer with the inside layer (neck and sleeves) being black which kind of looks weird when layering with a button up but is not that bad. Keeps you warm, I used it in low 60 degree weather and it held up just fine, just take my advice with the drying and it will fit the same as when you first bought it
B00UTSK79M|5|My daughter love it!
B00L62UUUG|5|Ok
B00486QDF8|5|I put this on for my fiancé and he loved it! He practically tore it off! and its super comfy! definitely buying more! AND it came earlier that expected which made me super happy!
B007K9AAHW|5|PERFECT
B000HTEE10|5|Levi 501's are the classic original jean.  Getting a pair in my size, in white took some looking.  They fit and feel just like my blue and black 501's-perfectly.
B008A4W50Q|5|I've never had  a more comfortable pair of jeans.  I live in them!  I'm at the age where I seem to gain weight in my waist. I have reach the age where I like to be comfortable but still like the look of a good fitting pair of jeans.
B004RQRCLI|5|Very cute on my call center head set
B000YETXRI|4|Size chart is very helpful and true to size:)
B002TLTS5Q|3|I received maybe 2 pairs of what is pictured here - the patterns were stars and not what I would ever pick out for my 4 year old. I kept them because they fit her perfectly and she's hard to fit being so petite.
B00BT94V7Y|3|This bra is adorable.  However, in accordance with other reviewers, the band around the ribcage runs larger than other Freya bras I own.  Stubborn, distrusting me.  I should've listened and ordered a 30 instead of a 32.  Ah, well.  I still wear it often, it's just a bit bigger than I'd like...
B008CPUM7Q|4|The only problem I have is the clip.  Harder to get the money from<br /><br />Overall product other than that is excellent
B008WYDR6U|5|the quality of the shirt is a little different than i expected, but its definitely a plus!!<br />great shirt, great quality, and style.<br />the size is perfect as well. its not oversized, or undersized.<br />Absolutely Love It!!<br />i would DEFINITELY recommend this to someone else.
B005U2YBUI|5|Excelente producto, de buena calidad, llego en el tiempo previsto y en buenas condiciones. Recomiendo este producto y la marca.
B007JPMWR8|4|The x-large shrunk enough to make a good fit. Husband likes t-shirts with a pocket and no tag which are getting harder to find!
B000FGHYNA|5|I like the color of the hat. It fits very well on the head. The fabric is of a good quality. Thank you for having this product available.
B00BQHE9B2|5|I am going to keep them even though they are large on me.  Listen......These shorts are a relaxed fit, in my opinion.  So on my &#34;Fat&#34; days I was looking for &#34;some room&#34;.  This had a bit more than I needed.  So ladies........Even on your &#34;Fat&#34; days, get your normal size!
B001DTAB06|5|This hoodie is very well designed and looks really cool. i got alot of \\"nice hoodie\\" \\"where'd u get that hoodie at?\\" comments.
B0079GNI4S|4|I like the tie and it seems to be good quality.  I wish the zipper would lock because it's annoying that it unzips throughout the day.
B003A71P8G|4|A gift for my really really ridiculously good looking son.  Other size and colour options would be nice, otherwise a good gift for a zoolander fan.
B00CU5LMT6|4|She feels like she needs a bra underneath because it's a little...slim
B00HHYV6N2|5|my son wants to wear this all the time ... Even in summer weather.  this is luxuriously soft and does not fray like cheap robes.  Washes well and does not shed lent.  I plan on finding one just like it for myself.  It is a little large, which is what I wanted so that it can be worn as long as possible until outgrown.
B00KXVR78Y|4|Very nice scarf!
B0090P5AG0|4|I love these PJs. Very warm for the cold winter times. I found the sad monkey faces on the print a little bit annoying. I wished all of he monkeys were smiling. Also I wish the elastic around the waist was a bit tighter so I didn't have to use that strap very often. Other than that it is a great purchase. For reference, I usually wear a Small but I purchased these PJs in Medium and I am not regretting that.
B00GSM2278|5|Repeat customer loved the Bra!
B00EZDXQ22|2|Look awesome... tore at the seams after a week.  Tore COMPLETELY after 2 months.
B00IU06WTU|4|Looks great buuut a lil too small
B001AI9ZD4|1|I ordered two black on 3/18 i get it on 3/21 pretty fast delivery<br />but the qualities has big problems. both of them are damaged on wallets leather<br />one in front, one in back. I want to get its return or replace.
B00GNJ3P5E|1|Buyer beware, it is not listed in the description anywhere but this shirt is dry clean only.
B00IJCY2GO|5|Very pretty shirt.  My hubby really likes it.  Quality of fabric is very good; shipping was quick.  Washes and wears very nicely...doesn't even need ironing.  We've both very pleased with this purchase.
B00CTGCA4C|5|My kid love it ,and my friend love too  and my famyli sixter they love for their kid too!i will tell my friend about this
B005Q65C6U|2|these are no great. Uncomfortable fabric and poor fit. Buy the Polo ones, very soft (especially after a couple of washings). Far superior to these.
B006V4WCPA|1|description says 4INCH but wen i got it it was only 3INC the should send me the one i wanted
B005SZJCN8|4|They are nice and long which is hard to find.  They fit well.  They are a good product over all
B00CADFW3K|5|Fits well.  Soft and stretchy.  Will work as a light weight jacket for early am drive to work.
B00LV56B5Q|5|I love the product, you can't go wrong with John Deere
B00QA2U4GC|5|excellent...
B00AOLE5QA|5|Tea Collection does not disappoint with this t-shirt: it's soft and comfortable and looks great. My 6 year old son wears his all the time!
B00L7O1M9Q|5|Looks great
B0084KXAK0|5|Great little basic!! Thought I ordered black...but got navy instead...Will probably return for black
B00JT4OU04|4|Would like it better if it were a little longer.
B002GHC2OW|5|i got a regular large..I am 198 lbs 5 foot 6. arms 17 inch..chest is pretty big... big hoodie. slightly hefty jacket. nice pockets inside and out... the ribbed bottom rides a little. Does not fit snug.. fits well...pretty stiff... i washed it before i tried it on... washed it in cold.water... says its made in the usa how about that! so, i love it and will wear it for years... great products carhartt has..
B0018OMMEY|4|These fit good wish they were a little looser, other wise great jeans. For me the 560 fits a little better.
B002XGAMSE|5|It is so hard to by clothes online and these are true to fit. It was exactly what they say so no reason to by a smaller or larger size than normal, their sizing is right on.
B00O3JDN3U|4|Cute but not a dress. Way too short.
B00AAQQGAW|4|Great shirt, I actually wear it when I am out with friends or working. It fits pretty good, the material feels to be good quality.
B00JZRBOVI|1|Do not purchase this junk. I ordered it the first week of April and received three packages. The packages were not damaged but most of the pieces inside were busted up beyond use. It took almost a month to receive. The blades did not fit into the blade holder, the cylinders ends were old round Christmas bulbs that where just laying in the box, Many missing parts and out of the eight blades shown we got four and two were broke. Most off these things were made of cheap foam and plastic. I can not believe this is sold on Amazon. It is absolute junk. We needed it for a convention, You are better off making your own. Please do not waste this amount of money you will be sorry!! I have pictures of the junk from the boxes please make sure you look at them. They even used old used up bubble wrap to roll the stuff in. I have typed another review but it is gone. Unbelievable. Also they expect me to pay for return shipping to China. I can not stress enough DO NOT BUY!!!!!
B001IGLD0Q|2|Ordered 2 of these for my husband. The rowdy is very nice and he loves it.<br />The dark copper is nice but scuffs/scratches very very easily. A jean belt loop that pulls against it will leave a long white scuff mark on it. Disappointed of the quality on this one. Will try to return.
B008A943QU|5|Just got this hat a few days ago. This is a pretty great hat fits well, comfortable and the Punisher skull looks great on it. I'm looking forward to being able to switch out the back patch.
B00APFEVGE|5|We ordered this dress to see what it would look like before ordering the remaining possible 15+ and it is perfect! The colors are the perfect shade of navy and turquoise. It fit very well and we received it within a week! We will be placing more orders today
B00E7TR13E|3|While the wig is great and fits comfortably, the description of this product says wig+wig cap+head accessory(as pictured)<br />I assumed the chobits ears would be coming with it, as it was in the product description.<br />Love the wig, wish it had the ears like it does in the picture..
B003DA5Y6E|5|My niece said she liked this and thought they were cute. I don't know how well they held up but looked well made.
B00R491N9W|3|I like it
B00YEEZQX4|5|Nice slim case that you can carry in your pocket or phone case if you just need to carry your id.  Has space for credit cards.
B00NCIBPPG|5|Super comfy - the perfect sleep shirt!  And it's cute to boot.
B00W6RS1ZG|5|Adorable! Fits great
B0080CYSU8|4|great
B0084748BI|5|this shirt was great , bought them for my son in law birthday gift, he always has trouble finding shirts that fit especially his arms hes a big guy, these were true to size thanx
B003WE9070|3|This has the perfect 1920-30s \\"race record\\" illustration for \\"Tumbling Dice\\" but it is strangely printed on the inside of a thin gray cotton shirt, giving it a washed-out look. I'd rather have it the conventional way. You could wear it inside out, of course, but the type is then backwards. You could explain the backwards type is because the dice is rolling.
B000RO0U36|2|These pajamas were cute but were much lighter weight than I expected.  With the pattern being penguins I expected winter (ie. warm) pajamas, but these are very lightweight, more springtime pajamas.
B00DY8QGTO|2|didn't like the fit, returned
B00IZ7L04U|4|Bought this for my wife. She is a petite 5'0&#34;, and as hoped for the small/med went down to her ankles without touching the floor.
B00KGWBWN6|1|The shirt doesn't fit. So when I contacted the seller to send it back they told me that shipping it back wouldn't be &#34;cost-effective&#34; for me to do so.  My advice: order two sizes up so that you won't have to deal with this mess.
B0081Q1I60|4|This is a nice soft tunic hoodie. The plum is very pretty, but its more of the \\"heather plum\\". It washes well and is super comfortable, but the metal Danskin \\"lable\\" attached to the front kangaroo pocket came partially off in the wash.I just took it all the way off as<br />it was more of a decoration then serve a purpose! I wear a 10-12 and ordered a large so I could layer it if I wanted.
B00DGM7GV0|5|Fits her perfect!  Great for her first Easter.  Would recommend to anyone who has their own little cupcake they want to celebrate.
B00KIHSYGC|5|I love the way this skirt looks, fits, and feels.
B00JSK1WIM|5|We love these shirts. Mine is a little bit loose but his fits great! They are comfortable and very cute!
B002RSBKHU|3|I'm 5'3&#34; and these would be good for someone a lot taller than me.  The waist int he photo shows the product to sit just under the belly button and these fit about 1&#34; ABOVE mine. The fit is ok otherwise - just really tall so they roll down which is not good.
B00FWJUVTO|5|I LOVE THIS SWEATER!!!!!! All the reviews about the sizing being bad, i got exactly what i paid for. The itchiness everyone talks about is there but it is not that noticeable. Overall I'm in love with this sweater!
B00YU4P9SA|2|Too small
B00JGM8TEM|5|Adorable fits my daughter great
B005442A0K|4|nice hat for the price
B00NOC536M|5|no problems
B00NM9TEOE|4|Very cute! Not washer safe.
B00KCXI0LQ|5|Nice quality.
B00ND5SGJG|1|The skirt is very short and see through, I had to remove it. The upper part looked ok before washing. I don't recomend the dress.
B00B0QMHJ0|5|Love it
B00KSCRVZC|5|These are very, very comfortable with no riding up and no show through clothing.  I love the feel of the fabric.  Just wish the pack would have come in all one color...black or mocha would have been my choice.
B00S41W8M0|5|I love it. Great fit, although the padding isn't necessary. I wore it with a shirt that was open in the back and it looked very hip.
B0080CACZ8|1|The folks at Timberland will have a huge 'rubber' fire when forced to burn these 'tourniquets' that no one can get on...!
B00W64FCWE|5|This order was received ahead of the expected time, and the hat is perfect.  It is a very light hat, as I had hoped.  It is also a very well made hat.  The little metal Sterkowski tag (although high quality and charming for a label) was easily removed for a cleaner look.  This seems to me a good company with solid workmanship.  They will undoubtedly be receiving my business again.  Fall is just around the corner.  I think it is time for something in wool...
B0084ASAKU|5|great coat. excellent material. excellent stitching....heavy enough to keep child warm in winter.  bough for average size 6 year old.  coat is longer then appears so on a short to average height child it will hang long. image is accurate.
B00ZWCBKVY|5|I love it! I'm a big girl too and it has a slimming effect too. I have 3 in different colors because I love it so much!!!
B007KFZGGQ|5|It was a great fit, would recommend this to others. Only advice being go up a band size to ensure comfort and fit. Having a bigger top half is a challenge finding a sports bra that fits, but finding one that fits AND give amazing support is a win win!!
B00BHLHPEK|1|I bought this shirt because the reviews stated they were happy with the quality of the t shirt. I love the BBT and the Opti Block Pattern. The quality of this t shirt is so Thin I can see through it. The silk screen pattern has lines in it similar to cracks with no color in the blocks. The sizing runs small do not even think about putting it in the dryer. Basically if you want to pay $25.00 for a one time wear in the yard T Shirt  you wont be disappointed Like I am. This is a honest review to the quality of this T shirt.
B004XFGK20|5|As cute as a fleece jacket can be. Nice slimming design. High quality. Highly recommended.
B00K2QLXL2|4|Cute!
B0083IELVK|5|I really appreciate them ever since I  lost a great deal of weight along with my breast sizes they really fill avoid in my bra :-)
B00GBQXFK4|5|Somewhat big and bulky.  More for a grownup than a teenager.
B00I19LZ4W|4|I ordered this in a XXL after reading reviews that it ran small. I'm glad I did. It's a great Tshirt but some what clingy. I normally wear a XL in most brands sometimes a large. It didn't shrink after washing but only got 4 stars due to the fact you can't put it in the dryer. I did have to put it in on med heat to reshape it for a couple of minutes which did the trick and it didn't shrink any. I do feel it holds it shape for the most part during the day and doesn't stretch out which I like. The color (RED) is nice a vibrant and it didn't fade with the wash. My only complaint other than not being able to put it in the dryer is it is a TAD long. I like my shirts longer so you can bend over with out showing anything however this is almost too long and I felt the need to turn it under to look right with my jeans. I'm glad I ordered up a size, but it has a enough spanx material to not hang like some shirts do without form. All in all its a very nice shirt!
B010OU854I|4|Its a good shirt fot the price it is a tank top but doesnt look just like one in pic fits good little tight in chest area
B00HVJ24M0|3|I ordered a medium and I am a true medium (size 8-10). I had to send it back it was so baggy....the arms was so big and baggy, it was long and just bulky.  It is a very cute vest, but order small!
B008GE3J00|4|I ordered small because I am a size 6 but found that I needed to exchange for a medium curvy.  I was able to figure this out because I read the reviews.  The legs are a bit long because I am only 5' 3&#34;... I weigh 120 and have the curvy hips.
B00FOIEW5M|1|Even a small was too big
B00JEAJFHG|5|excelente compra, buena calidad y los colores son como el de la foto
B00L60JB7Q|4|Love it, nice and warm!  I can wrap up in it!
B00SCD36TY|4|Very nice quality considering the price.  The top is very soft.  It holds up during washing.  It's true to size.
B000SKLTI4|4|At first I was a little nervous about putting them on. The way they just stared at me from inside the package. They were kind of pushy on when I was going to try them on. Sometimes at night especially, I could hear them complaining to a package of underwear I recently bought as well. My doctor tells me that this is not too uncommon, and with the right meds, thier complaining will stop. Sure enough, started the new meds and the socks have stopped staring and complaining. Now the poor underwear is lonely with no socks to talk to.
B00IVRW1RO|2|Dress was poorly made and fabric was cheap. I ordered a large and it had to have been a small that I received. Disappointed.
B0040U6ADW|4|He wanted a Joker costume that wasn't necessarily &#34;costume-y.&#34; Something he could wear regularly and wouldn't collect dusk in the back of the closet. He likes this. However, the screened necktie is a bit low for a necktie. It's in the middle of his sternum, not high in on the collar. If I had looked at the picture more closely, I would have noticed this. Will work for us.
B00CUSBX8S|3|the belt is nice- but never needed to wear it for what I bought it for. But it is well made and I am sure people would love it if they bought it!
B003JTYUWI|5|Love it.
B00429EF5G|4|Haven't worn them yet, but they hold up good under hand washing. Looking forward to when I can try them out. Will keep you updated whenI do wear them.
B009CCRZ0U|5|[[VIDEOID:moVGB4E3COVFSN]]These black socks are great...but do they smell by the end of the day? Watch the video to find out.
B00E9NLWH4|1|This didn't fit my just turned 3 year old with a below 50 percentile head circumfirence.
B009X69OIQ|5|I chose this shirt for a gift specifically because of the gorgeous color.  I couldn't tell how nice the fabric would be, but it is quite lovely.  It is nicely fitted for a taller, broad-shouldered slender man, and he loves it!
B000MN6HFM|5|They fit well, provide a good range of movement, wick moisture, and dry fast.  I wear them at the gym, on the trail, and lounging around the house.
B006EVQGNO|5|I have already have two children before this baby, so I have tried other mittens in the past. Either they are too tiny and fall off, or they get lost and just too much of a pain to put them on. I am soooo happy to have finally found guavamitts!  They are made with the softest, creamiest cotton.  They are stylish.  They are comfy and stay on!
B00D2R8SJS|5|love this dress.
B00TZ5LHHQ|5|Very comfortable pants!  I found size wise they were right on, but in length they were long.  I'm 5'7&#34; and bought a small and they touch the floor, but I'd rather have them long than short!  Wish I'd bought more when they were only $2.50.  Still worth the $4.50 price they are currently.
B001TKCXAA|2|The fan was much smaller than described at only 15&#34; wide and shed feathers like crazy when I opened it. Returned.
B00J94IDHK|2|Very poorly made. Bow looks ridiculous.
B0049N9RQ2|4|I really like this coat. The fabric is very nice. It feels wind proof and is very warm. My only complaint is that the velcro from the hood lands on the same spot all the time and it is starting to fray the fabric. Minor detail but it could have a small patch in that area to prevent this. Overall very good product.
B0006LMBJ6|2|the length is about 1 inch longer than the same style number that I  have
B00Q6DSI5O|4|If you're between sizes recommend ordering a size smaller. That said, I was looking for a loose fit - and this blouse delivers.  Would order again.
B00525IPTG|5|Bought as a gift -and my friend loved it-colors very bright and material soft. She wears it with a navy blue coat and it looks stunning
B00AHD0SY8|5|I was very happy with this purchase. I've learned my lesson on how this items tend to run small so I ordered one 3 sizes larger and I fits nicely.
B00JYCLJ4Q|5|fits perfect and looks great. I'd definitely recommend it
B00JPV6CNO|5|Daughter was thrilled to receive this button!
B008BVIZXO|4|Very pretty, but not very form fitting.
B002LWHYRW|4|The boot fits pretty good but I get killer blisters on my heels.  Not sure if they need to be broke in or if it's just the placement of the heel support.
B00GXJEDBO|5|Great fit
B00F2VCURI|5|Perfect  now that the weather gets a little nippy in the morning. Nicely made and such a pretty color.
B00NP2V9B4|5|Excellent product. My daughter loves these. No too short.
B005LMUXEU|1|The slip fits well, the waistband is great. But the slip always rides up and bunches up making my dress or skirt appear to be bulky. And this makes the slip defeat it's purpose. too bad I can't return, as I already ripped the tags and wore it.
B00AZGH8QI|4|Nice dress.  Worked great for roaring 20's party.
B002SY3ORM|5|Looks good and is extremely soft to the touch!
B00VZJ2KYY|4|washes nice,.  I still am waiting for the other 2 items.
B00DVFQGGI|5|Love these! Smooth, silky, stays in place. Sooo comfortable!
B004IFWM3G|4|These are super cute and worm. They tend to shed a bit but after the first wash they are better. I have to get some more!
B00D4C7LAI|5|This is my husband's favorite shirt. I like it because the white part is not too thin. It's opaque enough that he doesn't need an undershirt. He is 6'1&#34; and 140 lbs., and I bought him a medium. It's a nice length and not tight on his slender frame.
B00L3XSTI8|3|A bit tight in the chest area
B00EXP5WL0|5|very useful, fixed 3 pairs of sunglasses for me
B00HC3XAMI|5|Good
B00C9V23C6|5|My bust is 33B, I wear a size 2 and got a size Large. They're a perfect fit and not too tight. Buy at least 1 size larger because they run VERY small. I think the sizing is wrong because Chinese people are usually much smaller than Americans.<br /><br />I threw all of my other bras in the trash after wearing the Genie bra for a few days. I was tired of the back strap hurting my back, straps slipping off my shoulder and the feel of the back strap. I love the comfort and especially no feeling of being smashed.<br /><br />They look really nice with sweaters and fitted T shirts - a totally smooth look. The fit is like your own skin and it moves with you. I was wearing one while gardening - bending, twisting and moving in all directions. It stayed in place and never needed adjusting! Genie bras are so wonderful and comfortable!!!
B00HWFCUH2|4|These jersey pants serve the purpose for me.  They are comfortable and are to be worn while relaxing.
B000MX94LQ|3|You need to be a tall heavy women<br />To much fabric for my body to fit it as the picture shows.<br />Fabric is nice but don't know how it holds up for wash and wear
B003NUUXV0|3|This cape is fine for a costume party. It's not a great piece of clothing but it's a serviceable costume piece. I added a lot of embellishments to it to make it flashy enough for a masquerade ball. My husband will wear it over a tuxedo shirt, tuxedo slacks & cummerbund for a Renaissance Masquerade Ball. I added a jabot ruffle to hide the Velcro neck fastener.
B004TERICQ|5|she loves it
B00HT1TCPC|5|First day shipping! Great fit and plenty of compliments! I loved this shirt and it is extremely comfortable!
B001YI8WYI|5|This shirt not only fits awesome, but it looks incredible. The perfect gift for the KISS fan in your life.
B002P8VOPK|5|I purchased this raincoat for my daughter, who is 5'3&#34; and very slender. She has trouble finding clothing that fits well, but this coat with the belt looks great on her. It is roomy enough to add layers underneath, if needed. She wore it in the rain a few days ago and reports that it is totally rainproof! She also likes all the pockets, especially the ones inside the coat.
B008BP5XL2|5|VERY NICE
B00M3CZR7E|5|comfortable socks and well made
B008EYI556|4|This suit is quite big! it says 0-9 months but my baby is almost 12 and still wears it and by the looks of it, he will wear until he is probably over 18 months.
B00NY8D372|4|Solid tank.
B004Y52UYG|5|good as the picture but the size is too mall and not fit as they said it's one size mean for all. but isn't
B000J46QJ6|4|I wore a small in the late 60's now it's a medium.<br /><br />this type of top is multi-funcntional in all but cold weather.
B000GQFR1A|5|Ok
B00G99TABG|4|Love the hoodie and the style, but I'm 5'3 and 130 pounds and the small is huge on me.
B00A7NJG5U|5|They are fine
B002AXNKP2|5|Fast shipping, great product, great price. I purchased several different colors of headbands (navy blue, red, lavender, eggplant, aqua, camel, coral, hot pink) and all colors were true to the pictures. Would definitely recommend seller and product to a friend.
B005GW5C82|5|This is a great tank top that is silky and fits perfectly.  It covers my bra strap so nicely, unlike many tanks and camis out there.
B00FINQ0KI|4|I'm a 45 inch waist and had to use the tightest hook (there are two other rows of hooks available). This should give you an idea of the range it has for sizing.
B00KU3IH70|3|I am a pear shape so the bottoms fit, as expected. However, the top was ridiculously large. Due to the other reviews about the top being too small for most, I thought this would possibly work. Unfortunately, the top looked like Madonna cones more then breasts. The bottoms fit well but didn't do much to accentuate the natural waste as I had hoped they would. Overall, the design and product seemed nice but I would urge you to reconsider if you are not hourglass and encourage getting individual pieces for the suit.
B001HNBHBK|3|Not as nice as I was expecting for over seventy bucks! I like it in general, but the hat doesn't fit well because it's a bit shallow (tried on a few different heads).
B008H034VW|5|This jacket was very well made and ran true to size.  Little boy who loves legos and star wars will love this jacket. What a perfect combination.
B00DR8YLQ6|5|excelente
B00QNM5OJQ|5|My son was completely satisfied with the hoodie
B00GW6UGSC|5|Love the pants and shipped to me quickly!
B00E97KUFU|4|Love the color
B0055FK5VO|5|Love this shaper!  If you are looking for super strong compression all over, this is not for you.  The body of it smooths and shapes enough to make your clothes look better, but I bought it because the tummy band has more targeted compression to hold in my mom's tummy that still has a pooch.  I found that stronger compression shapers tended to suck in everything else so that my stomach almost looked worse, but with this the mesh on the back side of the lace band really keeps it under control.  I use a different type in the winter when I'm wearing layers of clothes, but this is invisible under a thin summer skirt.  Also, since it doesn't have a tight waistband, it just disappears under my clothes without a visible underwear line.  For those that are complaining that it rolls down - when it was new I didn't have this problem but a year of lots of wear later it started to happen.  All in all I find that it stays up better than my 10 other types of shapers.  Also, I hate to say it, but often if any shaper is rolling down it is a size too small.  I know sometimes we think, the smaller the more compression, but really it won't fit correctly.  I take size 10 in clothes and I get the large which fits well.
B004R1RF6A|2|I had been looking for a tee with a bottom banding, 3/4 sleeve and in a light stripe.  Pictured it was perfect, but unfortunately the material was very thin and the construction badly done.  Returned tee immediately through Amazon which was quick and painless.
B005I6IY5Y|5|This light layer under slacks is great for really cold winter days, especially windy days.  Not as dense as thermal underway, but just light enough to hold in warmth.  I'm allergic to wool and is a great layer when slacks are not fully lined.
B00A6G3X6G|5|Just all around good.  Fit great, look great on, extremely comfortable material.
B00HO5M3MW|4|They look good and work pretty well. For typing messages or doing anything precise it isn't perfect but its much nicer than freezing to death trying to view a text.
B00CSNXMZW|4|I bought them a little big. Works perfect. Has not snowed as of yet. Can't wait to try them out.
B00DBDPQVG|5|I give this skirt a thumbs up! I wore it to work with a belt and received compliments for it! The material feels lightweight and elastic, but sturdy. Runs a little big, but order your size. I had another pull-on skirt with this material and I had ordered a size smaller....big mistake! Every top I wore created a 'muffin' top...looked HORRIBLE! Remembering this, I had ordered my normal size though the fitting is loose, but not THAT loose. I wear my tops tucked in with this vintage skirt. Right on Brinley Co for making a good comfy skirt!
B004AY5LKQ|3|When looking at it here on this site, I liked the dress.  I ordered it in my size, but when I got it there was no way I could fit in it.  I had my husband see if one of his coworkers could wear the dress and wanted it.
B002BUTCE2|5|I'm 34-26-36. Have been wearing gigantic &#34;extra-small&#34; man-size lab coats for years. This product is flattering and so much sturdier than the thing you find in a college bookstore. A great investment!
B00ZF1XQR8|5|My daughter loves it
B006T7VCVO|1|So how does one get a bad pair of underpants?  Well get these for starters.  To sum up...<br /><br />Pros:<br />* umm, none?  Yeah, really, none.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The fabric was ridiculously thin.  Gauze (ie bandages) are about the same weight as these guys.  Actually, cotton from cheap Halloween costumes is another example.<br />* Several sizes too small.  If you want to get these, get like 3 sizes bigger than you would normally get.  BUT, the waist band was about 1 size too small.  The length and calves were 3 sizes, just to be clear.<br /><br />Stay clear of these guys!
B00591C9PY|5|I am 5'7&#34; and 122 lbs, and wear a size 27 pretty consistently across brands.  I wear all sorts of designer denim, with my favorite and go-to being Paige.  However, when looking for a classic pair of dark denim skinnies with little to no fading, I found Paige and other brands to be too stiff so that that I looked stuffed into them even when I went up a size.  This Hudson dark denim is a soft fabric so it hugs the body and is pliable over curves as opposed to being rigid.  As such, they look great on and are comfortable.  I got a 27 and found these true to size.  I also like the non-embellished, flat large pockets that lift the butt and give it a nice shape.  The waist is slightly higher than most skinny denim (I believe it is 9” as opposed to 8”).  I really like this higher rise because it is not too high but gives more coverage so no worries when you sit down or bend down.  These are a classic pair of comfortable dark skinnies!  I’m very happy with them!
B003IYYE98|5|I just got this product in the mail and love it. It's perfect for going out and wearing with nursing bra. It's nice and long, which I love. Fabric is soft and thin, can be worn by itself or layered. Size is true to what is on the description.
B001M9EGQW|5|These collar stays are fantastic quality.  The engraving is top-notch.  As long as I don't lose them, these will be the only collar stays I will ever buy.
B00BULA75G|5|excellent slim/straight fit without being too skinny, soft comfortable material with a nice stretch to it, great colors and quality. i was so pleased with my first pair that i ended getting them in three different colors. highly recommended.
B00BZ3F47K|3|Pedi dos small y llego 2 large. Mal
B000SXZX6K|5|nice t shirt
B0072OK20U|3|I bought these as a gift for my wife, they came all in one package and I didn't think about looking at everyone. Christmas morning my wife informed me that two of the bras were different sizes from the other four. She also thought the sizing was a little small from what they should of been.
B00LUAK2AW|3|european L is smaller than american L<br />The quality of the t-shirt is good
B008Z4DELK|5|I ordered this for my husband's birthday and he is loving it. You already know you can't go wrong with these caps.
B00428MY5K|4|So I ignored the previous review because this robe was too cute to pass up and it's surprisingly hard to find a non-one size fits all robe that is shorter in length.<br /><br />Yes, there were a few threads hanging off the robe but I gave it a good shake and it looked fine.  The material is not very substantial but it'll definitely do for spring through fall.<br /><br />More importantly though, this is a wrap robe, like a wrap dress, and has inner ties.  I guess you could avoid using it if you just throw it on but to get the tailored look in the photo, you need to do both ties.  Also, there is the satin type lining on the inside hem, which might not dry well after a shower but it's not a huge deal since it's on the inside.<br /><br />I got a small (normal size xs) and it fit perfectly - the sleeves fall to mid-hand, longer than they are on the model and at 5'4\\" it hits mid-thigh as it does on the model.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with purchase!
B00QA87G6C|3|Fabric is too thin. Returned.
B0076R6LGM|5|Perfectly comfortable and keeps me just as warm as I would expect it to. It's not quite a jacket/coat, so don't expect it to keep out the cold on those days when the temperature really drops. It fits exactly as expected, with a simple yet stylish design. Overall, I would definitely recommend this fleece jacket to anyone else.
B00LZRW55A|5|Nice top. Fit as expected. Will highly recommend.
B005G5XCF4|5|Size runs a little large but what great quality and workmanship!  This rugged, well made jacket will last a long time.
B00LJMS1R2|3|My measurements are B 32&#34; W 34&#34; and while I'm long legged I have a bit of a short torso. I usually order a comfortable t-shirt in a small but went a 2*sizes up based to the reviews and that I wanted the shirt to fit like on the model. It doesn't, it's too short and fits like a regular small tee. The fabric is super soft almost like an athletic wear.
B006ZYYEW0|5|Fit nice, heavy material should last a very long time. Happy with the purchase , will buy some more in future .
B003OF1L7O|5|Great!
B007EYYUF6|4|I ordered a 42 long because most of the reviews said to order a size or two up and I was swimming in this. I'm a 5'-9&#34; female, average build, and while this fit perfectly in length, I had a couple extra inches of material in the crotch and everything was wide. But seeing as I ordered this for a Portal Chell cosplay, and I will be tying the upper half around my waist, this does and looks exactly as it should and I'm extremely happy about that. Material is heavy and sturdy and its a very bright orange.
B005S0TQPM|5|This is the best everyday knife ever or for anything in fact fits in pocket never know it's there till you go to use it would recommend too any one
B004MMT7ME|5|These are true to size and fit her great!! I would recommend these to any girls who needs training bras!
B00C68ZX5G|5|Soft and tagless! Two must haves for this mom. My son has skin sensitivities and hates tags. These pajamas are perfect!
B00KMQ41XE|4|I'm a 36DD or DDD. A size 2 or 3 when they sell odd numbers. I'm 5'5. Fits nice. Good material. I recommend it.I bought t a size bigger which is Large.
B00WT5KC3E|5|I loveee these shirts! They are so comfortable and fit perfect! I wore mine to an amusement park and it didn't ride up and I didn't have to keep adjusting it...that is something I find so difficult to find in shirts. The colors are awesome as well. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00H7I9X4W|5|These are super cute but our baby is still too tiny for these. I'm sure they'll keep her precious feet warm once she grows into them. The design is unique and looks like they would stay on better than most baby booties.
B00MF1NN4M|5|I like them. There just what I wanted.
B00062ZBH4|5|I got this gift for a friend who has the matching purse. It can just in time for her birthday. I would buy from this seller agin.
B00ACIHDLE|3|My husband says the waist band was too tight.  Other than that he said they were all right.  He liked the material.
B00CHHBQGG|5|Nice set, soft material; wear on a light cool day
B00FEH3AIS|5|I could not have hoped for anything better with this product.<br /><br />It fits perfectly, and the color is exactly as shown on the website. It does not shrink or fade. The material is as tough as it gets, and it is perfect for rugged use.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to all men.
B00KA35WGO|4|Just a gift for my girlfriend ...she liked it just fine
B004Y7CSQY|5|It is a great cause! Getting these are a great gift and a great way to show your support. Find a Cure, soon.
B00960VQIK|5|This is dress is absolutely beautiful. I took the measurements twice for my eight year old daughter. It fit her perfectly with room to still grow into it. She is wearing this dress in my wedding as a Jr Bridesmaid. I could not be happier about the quality of this product. I am IN LOVE with this dress! :D
B009E3254I|1|I ask for M size, and I received XXL. Imagine!
B0018OOCX8|5|These worked great for my husband.
B00889AIKM|4|Item was great for the price. It runs a little small.
B002BB5858|4|I was so excited to receive my hospital gown from gownies. I think is so neat to be able to have your own and a better fit than those at the hospital. I find this gown really cute but was desapointed to find out the polka dots are stamped in the fabric and when you wash it the paint tedns to separate making your gown look worn and weathered although you haven't put it on once! The gown is nice it just lacks quality.
B00H3ZFKX2|5|My son's new favorite pj's!
B00LWN3830|5|Just cute and  adorable fit for a young girl
B0014JZ89Y|2|Nice soft shirt but not very long lasting. After 5 washes I noticed a little hole already.
B00IMA8G9M|5|Beautiful material! Nice weight and quality. Would definitely recommend.
B005POLLOA|2|I have the straps at their max length and feel they're still too short....I don't have much of a bust so I don't think these would fit someone with a large bust.  Also, the material around the top edge of the shirt is rough and itchy on my skin. I like the long length though.
B00183FCHE|4|These wings are beautiful and they are really big - for the price they are incredible. I bought them for my 6 yr old - the straps fit perfectly, but the wings are large - which is what she wanted.  She didn't want the smaller wings that were \\"child size\\". They arrived very fast, however they had a little kink in one wing and the glitter gets everywhere or I would have done 5 stars.
B0019ZKKS2|5|great shirt wish I had been at the event
B00A2O8NCQ|5|Perfect
B0018OOZM6|5|It's difficulgreat buy for these jeans. My husband loved them to find this size and the fit is perfect very pleased
B00WFZF9UY|1|Not a fan! Cuter in picture then in person!
B0042FGWLA|1|I see the photo is now removed with the sweater add, however it was there when I placed the order.  When I received the sweater, it was not the sweater pictured.  This is the first and maybe the last time I order from Newport News.  We'll see how they handle the return.
B00J7Z0M2A|4|These prove to be a comfortable fit (with added support)on my oversized body. They are well made. I haven't washed them yet so will wait to see how durable they are.
B00LO9DCME|5|Its a really cute dress.
B00CHGPU6O|3|too long!
B00QZHXNW4|4|Good quality good fit. My fiance' loves it.
B005GYGFZO|4|I have the same pair of pants from another store, so I purchaes the same size. For some reason, these were smaller, so i had to go up a size. They still run a little shorter, and the material is thicker and not as light weight. I give it a 4 because the pants are still a pretty good pair of pants that fit great.
B004GGUA5O|2|I understand I may be a bit 'nit-picky'.... But when I search for Vintage Tees & s a Hendrix shirt & order it, I HATE that it literally has, &#34;COPYRIGHT 2012&#34;,  screen printed on the damn shirt itself. Kinda looses the Vintage part of the whole thing, ya know?
B00LAF0NOC|5|Great quality, nice soft material.
B00J9TNCQW|4|My husband is definitely a XL.  This is a little tight.  But it kept the sun off well and wasn't too warm.
B0037Q2TIU|5|My husband loves the socks, hes had some for several years.  They are great quality and still do not have any holes or anything.  Kind of pricey for socks but they last.
B002AQRU0K|4|I wear 32W x 32L slacks.  I ordered three pairs of these jeans in that size.  That's what I got, and they fit well.  No major complaints.  Except, please note...<br /><br />I placed two orders.  First, I ordered two pairs (which I will call One and Two).  Then, I ordered one more pair (which I will call Three).  One and Two are identical; Three is different than One and Two, as follows:<br /><br />--One and Two have seven belt loops; Three has five belt loops.  Five loops is the least number any of my other slacks have; most of them have at least six and as many as nine.<br /><br />--One and Two have permanent creases down the front of the pant legs; Three does not.  The creases aren't necessary, but they do look nice.<br /><br />--Most importantly (to me at least),Three is about one inch longer than One and Two.  One and Two are the perfect length for me, even after laundering and a neglible bit of shrinkage in the 100% cotton material.  I recently bought two pairs of 32W x 32L Dickies, and they are the ideal length for me.  So, it seems Three was simply made too long.  The inside tags of all three have the same information, but the tags are made out of different material.  All three were made in Mexico, but perhaps Three was made in a different factory to slightly different standards.  I didn't return Three for a replacement because I might well get the same product in return.  I took Three to a local alteration shop and for $12 got the pant legs shortened an inch.<br /><br />All three fit wonderfully from my waist to my ankles.  If Three had been the same as One and Two, I would have given this purchase five stars.
B00M3DQCD6|1|These shorts are for someone with a big butt
B00G3JEBLQ|5|I bought these over a year ago and they have held up great!  They truly are non-slip and no show!  I love these socks.
B00LMZNW1G|5|They're the best; my second pair already<br />and the price on Amazon is excellent for these!
B004MY2H6K|3|ok
B0094Z631M|5|wearing it now, love it
B006C73V6K|3|Pants were good enough, a little thinner than i expected, and a little too tight even though it was my regular size, but a good deal for the price, id probably buy them again if i needed to.
B00MH640FQ|5|very nice shirt
B00BBW8B66|4|I wear this to the gym and its really comfortable.<br /><br />The only grip I have is that it seems to have an odor which I cant get rid of. No its not me :)
B00LAYI7WI|4|Love the fabric.
B000KEL6D6|5|These are my first of the &#34;Yukon&#34; Carhartts. I took the advice of other reviewers and got a size smaller and that advice paid off for me. The smaller size I ordered fits me perfectly. Oh man, these things are warm!!!!!  I was outside in a -20F windchill for 10 hours with these on. My core and legs never once got cool or cold. I got rather hot when I had to do physical work. As expected, they are rather bulky and tough as nails.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase.
B00TATNNF6|3|runs small
B00CDSFW5A|5|I'm replacing my old jeans that don't fit in all the right places like these jeans do. I'm happy I ordered them. I would recommend them to anyone who is tired of wearing the same old style jeans and I believe the cost is well worth it.
B00H375LAW|5|excellent product&#62; A+++++++++++
B002BXQQA2|5|whenever I wanna be the sexiest man in America. I just put these on...
B00ARDCES6|5|They are awesome !!
B00I1BMELS|5|love it - will order again
B00CA2W0YK|5|This is SO comfortable! The lacing hits in just the right place that it can act as an open crotch if the bottom lace is not laced. I really like that it's stretchy as it hugs all of the right places. My size is 34C, 30&#34; Waist and 42&#34; hip.
B009UZ50HE|5|This is very well made.  A little thinner then I expected.  My son love it!
B00I5RBVY4|4|The material is thin, so it is comfortable in warmer weather. Its hood is not quite what I had expected. I really do like it. It is what I had expected and the people I purchased it from were very cooperative and tolerant with me. Sehr g&uuml;t!
B007G0ZXCC|5|super comfortable bra, I only wished they made it bigger.
B0038L2FSI|5|Accurate to description and very high quality for a costume hat.
B00LAWJDZ0|3|Ran a little small but they were warm and cute
B009Q82HLW|5|Shipped quickly, just what I was looking for.
B00STVE9TU|5|Very nice quality. Pleased with purchase.
B00ELC3T2Y|3|I purchased the Coral. I like the neon orangey-pink color a lot.<br /><br />The garment is a simple, straightforward hoodie. It says there are thumbholes, though, and there aren't any, which is annoying.<br /><br />I love MPG in general, but this didn't quite meet expectations. For the price, I won't complain.
B004BIWO3I|5|My son loves this shirt.
B009WVI58M|5|Perfect for chill in the air ... I used it on the plane as a wrap and a blanket..
B00CDLHG2E|5|Lovely color and fit. Got many compliments. The dress is stretchy, flexible, albeit a bit short but goes great with a patterned brown stockings or boots.
B000ENMU5Q|5|Exactly what I wanted
B008D5EAJG|5|Actually I didn't  &#34;love it&#34; but my 4 year old grandson does. He was really excited about it. He just had to take it to daycare for &#34;show and tell &#34;
B00J2MGTLG|5|very happy with the purchase
B00KBP4140|4|My new favorite hat!
B004A7XY5W|5|I don't know why so many reviewers said they were disappointed with there only being four assorted and six white, it shows in the picture on the product page how can you not know it was going to be like that. As for the product I think they're a good deal and decent quality. I've bought this brand of underwear before but from the store. They're comfortable, fit well and are a good price.
B0083QLQ0G|5|Ahh-relief. Honestly, if I just shed some pounds, this would not be necessary but for now this product is a great help. Really, who wants to buy all new bras when you just need to lose a few pounds recently gained. This product works amazingly well. It stays attached even when the bra is laundered.
B004YZ848W|5|As ordered
B006W4UPQW|5|The light up eyes make the mask more realistic and it goes very well with the Iron Man 3 ARC FX Wrist Repulsor Gear.
B002UIAQA4|5|My partner got me this bra (in white) for Christmas and I ABSOLUTELY love it.  It fits me perfectly. It's hard finding bras the way I like in my size. I have since ordered two more.  So glad I discovered this bra.
B00PHO5M4S|3|The fabric is high quality like all Freya products, the fit was fine however the description says the coverage is moderate and I felt as though it was a little high in the back but narrow.  Just did not love it.  Looks good from  the front just not the back.  Descriptions of this style in other patterns are all over the place, but I agree with the ones who felt this cut was too narrow.  I love Freya bikini tops but have yet to find a bottom I love.  I not super skinny but not over weight either, normally a size 4-6 in U.S. sizes.
B00416UGP8|5|These are affordable and fit right into my Joe Rocket jacket. I haven't been unlucky enough to crash in them but they seem sturdy. They actually look like they would work for my AGV jacket as well as it takes similar inserts to the Joe Rocket jacket. Good value.
B007TTKFNW|5|Fits snug, made of good quality and seems durable. If possible buy several pieces so you can wear it around the house or outdoors. The plastic clips seem to be sturdy and easy to attach/release.
B00FR9589W|3|Its really cute and fits good
B00RQZ7XTI|3|I like the skort but the fabric is a bit too wrinkle. It's not easy to maintain.<br />You need to iron it. Once you wear and sit in your car, by the time you get to the destination, it will look wrinkly again :-(
B00K7W9H1Y|5|They fit great looks sexy on
B00KLJ1D3I|5|They turned out really cute! I had compliments all night when I wore them.
B00JO7BYAU|4|This is a really nice, unconventional piece for the beach. I also use it at home over lingerie. Has a lovely vintage look without the vintage price. It is a little small on me, so I think the sizes run slightly smaller than American sizes. Also, keep in mind that this does not completely close in the front. It doesn't seem to be meant for full coverage, just for flirty fun.
B001GCVHHQ|5|great
B0002X5JD8|4|I am very happy with this top. Worth the money, very soft & well made. I am ordering another asap. I feel it runs true to size I am a 10-12 & bought the x-large & feel it is very roomy. I will order a large this time. The only bad side of this shirt is the shipping charges. If I had known how much I was going to like this shirt I would have order more the first time.
B0073E589O|4|Amazing costume!<br />I got a lot of compliments.<br />Didn't wear the belt though I have a small wait but big hips.<br />It was to tight.
B00QKF3XO4|5|Great for my son's silly sock day at school.
B008OC6IM0|4|I live in hot humid Houston, and bought these for moisture wicking properites.  For most dress slack wearers, these would highly functional, terrific slacks.  Returned to Amazon (thank you), for below unusual reasons.<br /><br />My objective was to use these for hiking and bicycling… unusual uses, I know, but I couldn’t find long pants for sun protection and with regular pockets and moisture wicking<br /><br />Indoors, these slacks are among the best slacks I’ve ever worn.  The moment I step  into air conditioning, these cool very well, I’m guessing due to its moisture wicking properties.<br /><br />But, while riding bicycle, the material blocked the travelling breeze, so I actually sweated in these pants.  If a person was to repeatedly bike and stop somewhere with AC, this would work well.  But extended biking or hiking—doesn’t moisture wick well.  Hiking—I have thinner material pants that work as well.<br /><br />In summary, excellent moisture wicking and temperature cool slacks for indoors.  Maybe manufacturer can improve for use outdoors.
B00P2CHMKC|4|So I read the reviews about size and bought them anyway. I'm 6'5&#34; and normally wear size 34x34, I ordered the 36 waist and got jeans that look and fit like 34x34 skinny jeans, so it worked out. Definitely tighter then I prefer to wear, but this is for a costume so no biggy.<br />Order at least one size up.<br />Someone else mentioned the button coming off easily and yeah, it feels cheap and mine will probably come off soon too.<br />Overall I'm satisfied though.
B0011FKRBK|4|Those bras great soft fabric and make the  shape you really need for. A T- shirt only one shortcoming is the wide band below the cups which may leave some marks .
B005WUIT24|5|I love these tops. I'm about a 14 and I order the XXL because they do run a tad small. But the colors are lovely and the quality is great. It's hard to find a nice V-Neck that isn't a cheapy burnout fabric. These don't need to be layered, and they're great for the gym!
B0009MZYEQ|3|fits good
B00J8XSD3G|5|I do like this jean and I have a Malia, but ordered a Nora also, and prefer the tighter fit at the ankle.
B00E951DB2|1|It looks blue and black but is actually purple and brown...Because I had ordered it as a boy's Christmas present and waited so long for shipping, I was very disappointed.
B005PY5YPM|5|Used this passport wallet on my trip to Italy.  It had slots for my credit card, hotel room card, driver's license and one other slot.  On the opposite side there is a place to slide in your passport.  Great product.
B00MJAKDQK|5|Pop pop loved his Father's Day gift
B0001ONU2U|5|Have sent for a bigger size  a 3d was too small need g but bra doesn't come in G
B008AP0AB6|5|These ties are so cute.  My daughters were excited to find these in their stocking at Christmas.  I love the ease of using these and both of my daughters say they don't make your head hurt after wearing them all day long.
B0026P45TY|4|Fits as expected, comfortable and very good quality and should last a long time as so my wife say's, it's Playtex.
B002PA8SJI|3|Th color seems to be true to the image online. The paisley print is indistinguishable in this rather light color palate and it looks like it will fray easily on the edges, as it's not of a high quality. But it does have a fairly nice sheen.
B00COVUWEM|3|I read all the reviews that said to get a size larger than you normally would. I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh 125 pounds and normally get a medium so I ordered a large. The large is so snug it fits like an extra small! I can't even begin to imagine what a medium or God forbid a small would fit like. Too bad they don't have an extra large size or I would be all over it. Other than the insane sizing going on here, these are great shirts. Very soft material, lots of great colors, and very affordable. But if you're not fairly small in frame to begin with, you probably want to skip these.
B0088OTV32|4|This is a great onsie. We bought it for our 4 month old to go to a pirate party.  It is super cute and the sizing seemed perfect.  So far it has washed well; still retaining its sharp black color.
B00NG3J75W|4|I'm about 5'5'' and they fit pretty well, they are a bit small but nothing horrible. They are really cute and I can't wait to wear them!
B0007QN66M|1|These thigh slimmers come up too high, almost to my lower bra line.  If you sit, the top rolls down.  Works if you stand and not move at all after you put on a slim dress or knit wear that should have a smooth look.  The thigh binds and you end up with a roll at each leg.  I am 5'2&#34; and 125 lbs hoping to have gotten a smooth look while being minimally overweight.  Waste of money for sure.
B00ANVR5AE|4|i had to give it away cause it was a little small. If you have it in an extra, extra large it would fit great and i would get one asap
B00HC0DRS8|5|My husband loved. He's thinking of buying a second one
B003ZTREQQ|3|It's cool. The Wu looks great. Only issue is the quality of the actual shirt is low. Bottom quality. You get better quality shirts at foot locker, champs etc.. But this is going to be around the house, to the gum shirt. So it will serve its value. Just don't expect some premium quality.
B007RLAKJQ|4|Shirts always tucked in, easy to change diapers with snap inseam.  Raised my kids in many overalls & now I'm enjoying giving them to my grandchildren; they can't crawl out of their pants.
B0047RP55C|5|This shawl / scarf is a rich burnt /smoky red color.  Light weight, easy to use in multiple applications - scarf / tie / belt / shawl / head covering.  Unlike fleece, this material breathes well and feels very soft next to delicate head and neck.  Glad I got this and other colors.
B00C4NPTB6|1|I bought this for a shower gift for my niece. I was so excited with anticipation of its arrival, however I'm disappointed the the actual product. The tail piece has knots & loose threads showing, the bra piece ends are very short and unfinished I don't think it will fit a newborn baby. The headpiece starfish curls up into a big knot. I guess you get what you pay for in this case.
B004A7XXUS|4|Great for having multiple panties. The cloth is a bit thin on them, but I don't mind. I've had a previous pack before and through washes, they do thin out a bit but I haven't had problems with holes or anything. Definitely a good buy.
B0089ZUVAW|5|Poppies hat,looks great
B00F8LPCJK|5|Love this dress/ shirt you can wear both ways (with pants or legings). Butifull fit, nice fabric. Just love it Terra Nomad products.
B00CD9SZA8|3|When the reviewers said this suit runs small, they spoke the truth.  I normally wear a med to lg, 10-12 so I ordered this in XL and it doesn't even come close to fitting.  I doubt an XXL would even cut it.  I am disappointed because it is a very cute suit.  Sending it back :(
B007OUFR9S|2|Very small for a size 8
B001IACK9K|1|This supplier shipped what appeared to be a second quality shirt.  Shirt had various sized   holes.  The material appeared to have been damaged during manufacturing process.
B00IEZDEJC|5|Outfit was wonderful and looked great on her!
B00FUTTDB8|1|Actually, this was not the Confederate battle flag. A square version was used by some regiments, but if you wear this shirt you need a history lesson. This flag only came to represent the South and the Confederacy as a whole after DW Griffith's Klan-loving Birth of a Nation came out.
B004LG0TSC|2|To big of box for that small thing
B007WEOCYM|5|They are light weight and are a perfect fit.  Very comfortable to wear and this take too many words to review.
B000JHAX60|5|Great Jacket, excellent quality, and fits great! Thank you!!
B00SWB2X1S|5|I ordered one size bigger and it fits. I have a bad back and this helps! It also makes me look better, more fit.<br />But the big thing is that this help keep my back straight. Price is Great!
B00A76LRPE|1|I shop a lot from uxcell.. and this one is the worst I have ever recieved... Its not at all what is there on the picture. I won't recommend this to anybody.. please don't buy this product...
B00Q3KQ9VK|4|Its ok.  Runs tight.  Junior sizing.
B00TIC58T4|4|It's VERRRRYYY short! I love it, the width is good, but the length could very well be longer. The zipper seems kind of cheap like it may break in the future but its so cute, and I will just wear tights with it!
B00PCLOIRI|5|Fit's great feels great
B00EXHHYUK|1|The size is way off. I gave it away immediately, not even worth trying to return, delivery was ages
B00MK5HGLY|5|Perfect. Thank you!
B00I4BL4ZM|5|I love these scrubs! I'm female, short (5'0&#34;), and curvy (thicker thighs and butt with a small waist), so naturally, pants never fit me properly, except for these! I tried on scrubs after scrubs and they would either be so long I'd have to hem at least a foot off the bottom or way too snug in the thighs and butt and giant in the waist. These fit perfectly (I got a petite small). no need to hem, and stays flush against my waist and isn't uncomfortably tight in any areas. I've gotten compliments at work on how well these fit. Couldn't be happier. I originally tried them on in store but they only had grey so I came on amazon and bought 3 more pairs! High quality fabric and in the 6mo. I've had them, have had no problems with seams or anything to do with how they are made. Worth the money for me since I wear them almost every day and I didn't have to pay to have them hemmed or taken in at the waist
B00S4ZKF1C|4|Normally I'm a small (32c)  so I ordered a medium and it fits good- still very snug.
B00LF4APGY|3|Fits very well...I gave it a 3 stars because the fabric looks cheap and very light.
B00B2HUSP2|4|Fabric thick, size length are appropriate. Ok.
B00H96F44U|4|Nice quality but way larger than expected. A large is really an X large.
B00IOE1BTS|5|Love these!
B0014C88AM|3|Good enough
B00EHI9DDQ|3|Sizing was off on the shorts.  I can usually buy a L or XL, but not with this brand.  It was unfortunate as I was looking forward to shorts in this color.  I'll have to keep looking.
B005VC2HNK|5|Excellent product
B0041FIC28|5|This wallet is my wife's  backup secretary holding mainly membership cards and future binders of checks. She uses it in her purse or walker.
B00DF07LEA|5|HOT!!!
B00A7QUD72|5|Most generic tshirts fit too big. These are comfortable, have a smooth cotton weave, and are on the slim fitting side. Not for those trying to hide a beer belly, but perfect for someone looking for that athletic fit. The BEST bulk t-shirt purchase ever!
B00WJ4BUWW|5|Love THEM!
B00N5FHZ64|5|very nice fit and comfortable
B0073E533A|5|The cowl is as advertised, it looks awesome, makes me feel awesome! The only complaint is, I have a BIG head (hat size is XXL). My head fits in the mask, but my cheeks stick out of the opening. Given that it's foam rubber, over time it will probably stretch to better fit. But other than that....YES. I like this Batman cowl a lot.
B00F46PGBI|4|Fits great
B00GD3QAR0|4|My daughter loves this backpack.  The lights give this a stunning affect along with the shades of teal.
B000Q8H25W|4|Not quite as fluffy as expected, but still gets the job done. Very soft material! You might need two if you need to add a lot of bulk under a dress.
B00MUKK6FW|5|My husbanded loved the socks they fit well and were not as thick and heavy as most boot socks. However after one washing one sock ripped at the ankle, the other two pairs appear to be fine. I will be calling to see what can be done to fix this because he loves they way they fit. UPDATE: I called amazon and they are sending my out replacements, and I get to keep my original order. I am pleased with how they handled the issue and I am glad I didn't have to return them.
B00P1NL1JU|5|Beautiful pj, great quality and fit
B00IJQKGYM|4|It was nice but not flattering on me. I think these dresses look better on someone with curves. Im 5'8, 120 lbs and a 34 D with narrow hips and small behind. I got the small and it was long enough and fit well but was not flattering. Nice heathered navy color.
B00B8ZEVE2|5|I absolutely love how this hat fits me, it is snug and warm and overall the cutest winter accessory i have this year. '
B002M09DJ0|2|Wasn't a great fit. Great idea, good for a prop, but the hinges on the inside do hurt your head.
B00DYYWFVG|5|It is cute and nice fitting
B00OOL67Y4|5|I bought this for my niece - it fits her perfectly - very nice dress...perfect for her to class up her wardrobe
B000VWAHAA|2|I really wanted to like this.  I spent a week researching coveralls online, reading reviews, looking at sizes, etc.  I ordered a small, regular, because I couldn't find a short in the right size.  But this is HUGE.  My six foot neighbor could fit in this without a problem.  I am 5'5&#34;, size 8, and the arms are 6 inches too long, the legs are 10 inches too long.  The arms and legs are three times as wide as my body.  I will have to send it back.  And, as far as insulation goes, there is none.  It says it is quilted and insulated, but it's not.  There is a thin layer of nylon fabric lining the cotton duck, but there is no padding between the two.  Nothing.  It is made in Bangladesh.
B0006SCZPO|5|not too full in the body, really long sleeves. usually nearly impossible to find a shirt with long enough sleeves that isn't really fat also.
B00F0LNYV6|5|Great shirt/good fit. Nice & soft material. Would definently buy more of their products.
B00DGLUNM0|2|Really disappointed I bought this as a gift and it was huge, unless you have a really big head this hat is a no-no .
B002BZVDCG|5|I went ahead & ordered this even though it had a bad review & am very satisified I did!  It didn't take too long to ship & is exactly what I expected!
B00F4ODNL0|5|HOT on big hips
B00ZZR5AIK|5|I got this in Rose Red to spice up my relationship and I adore this! The way it feels so feminine yet sexy and hugs my curves in all the right ways.I am not a big lace girl but this is the right amount and even after washing it it still looks and feels brand new!
B003CIYOHW|5|i was going to wear for hallwoween for my grand daughter. she wanted me to be snow white. but we had sandy. here i n ny.i happy i got it ill wear next year.
B00JEG33WS|5|John Deere is a favorite company for our family. We all go back a long way so this was a must for our newest family member. It is a really cute outfit that is comfortable and nice looking when he wears it. The color is brilliant and looks really good on our boy. We are very pleased with this John Deere green outfit. Very good choice for us. We enjoy seeing out boy wearing this outfit.
B00JVTNZ1M|5|Did not take long to arrive and fit perfectly.
B004ISKFT6|1|Item was opened up and placed into washing machine - was not worn.  Came out with seams opened in several places.  Stay away.
B001HZMN7U|1|Fit badly and not worth the money. Not attractive
B00JJ1R5SQ|5|I love these things, feels and looks like great quality
B000P8VQLY|5|Everything that Dragon Fly makes is fun. I buy these shirts for my husband and son. Both of them find shirts made by this company that they like. This particular shirt was for my son to celebrate Halloween. It was a big hit. I highly recommend this shirt to others.
B0010W39QE|5|I have purchased Lunaire strapless bras for the last 7 years and this bra surpassed all of my expectations.  I only wear strapless bras and as a 34DD, I need all the support I can get.  This bra minimizes and is very comfortable to wear.  Absolutely LOVE IT!!!
B008CQCZXY|4|Good size t shirt, good quality on the graphics on the front.
B00K5ZIRIW|5|Very happy with these Sakkas dresses- perfect for summer
B00LH4K2ZG|3|started to come apart after first wash
B004FEEZ80|5|I love the classic beauty of a white eyelet sun hat. The added safety of 50 SPF material is a bonus. I highly recommend.
B000NCJWQS|1|this item was returned 3 weeks ago and after numerous emails , i have yet to recieve a refund.
B003VQQGWQ|1|You sent me the wrong size bra, I ordered a double d's you sent me triple D's. The bra does not fit right. The quality and fabric great, just wished I got what I ordered.
B003HC92LQ|5|These socks are Amazing!  They just don't wear out like other socks, they're comfortable and fit great.  I wear a size 13 and they work just fine.  I found these in a store one time and haven't found them since.  All my socks will be PowerSox socks they just can't be beat in my opinion.
B002HJ2SV6|5|These twill pants are gorgeous in the way they are made and their fit. Excellent design and craftsmanship.
B00LM1U9E8|5|very beautiful dress
B009QK6Q44|5|Love these gloves. I bought them to replace ones that I had to match my black coat with fox fur ruff. i was upset when I lost one, but being able to find such similar ones has worked and they do match my coat so well. Lovely and warm with elegance and they don't compromise one's manual dexterity too much.
B002208B8O|5|I like the these wig caps fit my head, especially since it is small! I will be purchasing these again.
B00ID4RQN4|5|Very comfortable, and fits well.
B00SJY2LUG|4|Love the shirt. Size ran smaller than expected.
B00DILCE2A|4|I loved these. They were a little baggy at the bottom and the waist line was a little short but other than that they fit me fine.
B00N0XVUZS|1|Too small
B00DQWO0UA|1|I bought one for my boyfriend for Valentines Day. When it came in the mail and opened it, I was immediately disappointed. You can see and feel the square from where the text was cut and ironed on. I'm returning it. For almost $25 for a t-shirt that's made so poorly, is completely ridiculous.
B00180G8UM|5|My son is very large for his age, so I can't vouch on this diaper fitting a 24 month old (he wears this size at 9 months), but it fits him well and seems to work just fine during his swim lessons. I would recommend it!
B00DWXJWRE|5|excellent seller, 100% recommended
B00CN3WFOQ|5|I normally where a size 10 blouse.  I'm 5'7.  I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly.  Super cute on.  The fabric in the middle stretches and the sleeves are sheer.  Love the bow tie in the middle.  Shipping was fast.  I love this blouse!
B00K1H7S0M|5|excellent product and seller
B005WR5CS6|3|This is a beautiful corset but it requires assistance what putting it on. This is not the kind that you can keep tied in the back and just do up the from when you want to wear it. The front is very difficult to do up especially when it is on.
B00CIBCJ8K|5|I ordered two scarves--the coral/white and teal/white. While the coral was a bit &#34;redder&#34; than I had imagined, I'm still giving 5 stars because I love these scarves THAT much, and they are THAT worth it! They're very comfortable, made with a light/sheer but durable fabric, and fit perfectly. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. I'm definitely going to order more scarves from this seller; they did a really great job. I have absolutely no complaints at all!
B007XL50S6|1|I ordered this shirt for my sons birthday party. I was happy with it until i tried it on him. When he went to put his arms in, i noticed that there was a huge hole in the seam where the shoulder meets the sleeve. It looks like it was never sewn at all. So now im gonna have to find someone to fix it because my sons party is in 2 weeks and there isnt enough time to send it back and get a new one. Definatley not happy.
B00OV7OTV4|5|Feels good.
B00JY9BHLE|1|This is basically a Terrible item does not fit true to size at all
B00BLPTE8C|5|This is a really Nice Shirt. It is well made and irons up beutifully
B000J3GD3Q|5|Nice
B006TC6JHG|4|good product shipped quickly
B00EPIUR38|4|I like the extra warmth provided from these however they are sheer, so I have to wear them with something else
B00LPR44XQ|3|This is your local Target's Circo brand hat. I am a very frequent Target shopper so that is find by me but the listing didn't make me aware of that before the purchas. It is true to color. A durable quality but not something I'd really be upset if she got it dirty .. or heaven forbid lost at the zoo.
B00QP21470|4|Was disappointed that there were only 4 steel bones in the corset (front and back) but it works for a beginner.
B00G5QOVTY|4|Good quality,seem to wash well too
B006CUMKLE|4|My husband likes the shirt and that is saying a lot because he is hard to please. We have a joke about how he returns most of the gifts I buy him. This was a keeper!
B00CLVEOY4|5|Fits great!  High quality.  Thank you!
B00HLRGRUW|4|It was much too big in the waist and the hips, I do not think a smaller size would have worked as the legs are perfect for me, as well as the length.  I did the alterations and it fits perfectly,  so I am very satisfied with the purchase.
B00L3ESWQG|5|Love this coat!  I usually wear a 12, and never know if I need a large or a medium.  After reading the reviews, I bought the medium, and it fits with room to spare. The brown/black is not your usual wool solid colour, and I get compliments on it when I wear it.  It's definitely not for our coldest days in Canada, but it will cover a great deal of the late fall and winter days beautifully!
B00OPHO78K|5|These buttons are great. A lot of buttons have the clear film that peels off and pins that do not bendout of shape.  I've made an inquiry into the possibility of a bulk order. I'm looking forward to continuing to use  this vendor. Thanks.
B00GFXNW6A|5|Bought this for my sister who adopted another baby. It's as pictured. Super cute. Just wish it came in different colors.
B00D6AKX9Y|5|Got it for my girlfriend and she loved it. looks professional and has a very nice cut. She loved the red part.
B007D1PT1Y|4|Great shirt. Good quality.  My son enjoys the fit and comfort of the shirt.
B00NWQO5CI|5|My boyfriend got me this for my birthday and i LOVE it!!! Its so comfortable and warm and not super heavy or uncomfortable like other robes.
B006ODTBXY|5|Blah blah blah
B00NYMBFC8|1|Weird  fit and so short it shows your vagina.  My best bet is to hem it into a shirt.  Buyer beware,  do not purchase.
B001335F9Y|5|Good
B0085K36J4|5|Perfect fit
B00QJV12XI|5|The onesie is a very soft material and is very true to size.  Just a tad big on my 11 month old But for perfectly after a wash.
B009DNTPW4|5|Dadddy's retired Navy man.... loves it
B00GTFY7IQ|5|Its Gold Toe, they're great!
B00Q6GQ4QQ|1|Ridiculously small, the shoulders straps  are so short unable to wear it and no way to adjust it. I purchased the x-large for myself and i'm sure my 16 year old wont even be able to wear.
B006SRTEZ6|5|MY BOYFRIEND LOVED HIS THERMALS
B0047O3SWC|5|I'm 5'2\\" and this in a 6 fit me great. It hits just at the top of the hip (so for tall people this may be a bit short) and is true to size. The fabric looks much better in person than it does on the website. I'm very happy to have this blazer and at the price it's listed for.
B00883VP4G|1|I was very disappointed when I received my wig because to my dismay it was not the same color at all. In the picture provided the wig is a dark blue color and if you look closely there are lighter blue highlights. When I received the wig it was a bright aqua blue color and the bangs were darker blue nd the highlight were dark blue. If color doesn't matter then by all means
B003X0G09O|5|This is as simple as it gets; a pocket to hold your cards and small amounts of cash. It resists scratches fairly well, is built to last, and is backed by a 100 year guarantee. What other features do you need?
B00DG6L9QE|5|perfect, i love it...
B001D1WQV6|3|Just got these in the mail. Hardly look like the ears shown in the picture. Came with spirit gum which is great though. Hopefully they're sturdy. I'll update my review once I've tried them on.
B00KTQJ3E4|3|The tank top is VERY long
B00JDF3CIK|4|I truly love the design! The material is a bit dense which makes for a warm sweatshirt. Do follow the directions for washing and drying. I would have given this five stars if it was sold in my size. It is sold in one size fits all. I am five feet tall so it is a bit large on me but not too bad.
B006WWP9G0|2|Nice dress but way too big. I even ordered a size down but I recommend ordering at least 2 sizes smaller to get a good fit.
B00D7BZ4OG|1|I would rate them zero if I could. Do not buy from them! They sent me the R2D2 dress and instead of the lines being blue they are bright purple! They should really change the picture and the name because it is just a dress with stripes because it is the wrong color. When I tried to message them and address the issue they told me I was wrong and that the R2D2 dress is indeed purple! Since when is he purple! I never write reviews but I expected a nice Star Wars dress instead I got a dress with bright purple lines! So disappointed.
B00400OJF8|5|I bought this brand and style bra many years ago and have wished I could buy more but didn't think they were available anymore.  I was thrilled to find these bras again!  Very happy with my purchase.
B000UE9570|5|If there were a way to objectively rate such a thing, I think this shirt would go down as the best T-shirt I ever owned in my life.  I don't often get compliments on my T-shirt choices (not for lack of style mind you), but I have gotten several on this one.    In terms of sizing, If you are between sizes I would order the larger of the two as the shirt seems to run a slightly small.  It has an athletic fit, and is very comfortable.
B00T96W748|2|I followed the size chart but the romper was still really huge on me. I can't imagine what the medium would have fit like. Also I did this following the size chart that was a photo claiming a size large was 38 bust, 35 waist, and 41 in hips.
B00440CYD8|5|This was a straightforward purchase of a useful product that isn't fancy but which does the job.
B0040A81PW|1|The loops where you string the ribbon through popped. WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THAT. I was werring this for a play for my student. I had to where a white shirt with the skirt instead. :-(
B00VHUMIOS|4|Normally I wear medium even the large is a bit small but it works.
B00GTW70HE|5|Very soft, great shirt
B00AF30JXU|4|thought they would be warmer but great price
B00SMRN88Y|5|Sunglasses were well-packaged and came with a firm-sided carrying case, microfiber cloth, screwdriver, and carrying sleeve that exceeded my expectations at this price point. Glasses look and feel well constructed with more substantial metal than I was expecting and the lenses work well. I was expecting less of a gap between the nose-bridge and my face. Otherwise, at this point (5 days after arrival), very happy with the purchase.
B00KHSSAK2|5|Excatly as shown in picture
B0097L768M|1|The dress fit just fine, even if it wasn't meant for a person with a small torso.<br />The main reason it is being returned is because it appears that someone already took the dress out on the town.  There were stains around the chest and snags on the chest, sides, near the bottom, and the zipper was already coming undone as well.<br />Hopefully others have a good experience, but this order didn't pan out for me.
B006X9LFW4|5|I like the fit and the color.  it also has washed well and looks great afterwards.  I would recommend it.
B00AK40498|5|The shorts are really awesome, I really recommend them. Just know they are rather thin but they feel amazing on.
B00EU9PH9Q|5|very comfortable
B00CE3HPY0|5|good
B007S016WQ|3|It is ok for what I needed it for. The mask is not perfect and is lopsided. There is some foam in the mask and I recommend rip it out and glue it back in because the glue they used was cheap.
B003V4AL4C|5|Seems durable, have not given it to my fianc&eacute; yet. He is in desperate need of a new leather belt, he's had his since high school and he is now 35 years old. SO I got this one for sweetest day for him. Hoping he likes it. I took it out of the packet , the size seems right on, and the belt looks like it could last a long time. Guess we will find out soon. Will come change review when worn for a little while.
B00G20WEQ0|5|These socks are great!
B002PN2RA6|5|These are just what I was looking for.  The seams on the sides really make these feel great fitting.  The inner seams at the bottoms of the legs are very good quality.  These things do not ride up AT ALL.  There is a tie on the inside of the waistband, which I like.  I have been losing weight and am able to get these things tied just the way I like them.  The chamois is pretty thin, but this is to be expected in a tri pant.  Coming out of the water I don't feel like a have a sponge tied to my a$$.  Overall these are amazing for the price.
B00Q4JWEW8|5|the xl bottoms fit perfect but if you are busty ( im a 38 DDD or possibly larger) and the top is too small . i contacted the seller and they responded super fast and worked with me so i can get a 2x but i only need the top and im going to wear the xl bottom.
B00HJZL7G0|5|Love it!<br />Keeps your back straight.<br />Re-affirms your waist.
B00KYSF0Y4|5|Absolutely perfect sports bra. I have been looking for a front zip for a long time (that does not cost an arm and leg) since pulling a sweaty sports bra over your head can be somewhat difficult, depending on the level of sweaty! I am not an extremely busty person to offer that type of review, (36B) But I can tell you that the quality is great and I honestly feel it would offer great support for those that are bit more blessed that I am. ;) For reference, I am 5'7', 150lbs, athletic build, 36B and ordered a medium.
B00WXRIOGA|4|I would go 5 stars on this except for the bottle opener. I cut the stitching and took it off. I can't imagine running it through the washer/dryer, it's a terrible idea.
B00N53OVM2|4|Very cute dress on my daughter for Easter.  It shipped fast
B00EKNQV6A|5|How do you review a shirt? There's not much to it, it fits, the material feels good and I love the design.
B001TCIWU8|5|Having recently acquired his \\"dream car\\" - a '92 Trans Am Convertible, this is now his \\"dream hoodie\\".  It fits great and he wears it nearly everyday.
B00DZS1RP6|5|Love this shirt
B00F0WW844|5|I like my bra so much. I can't wait to use it with a sexy dress or top. I am naturally a C Cup, but it fit somewhat small. I may order a D Cup to see if there is more coverage or any difference with the &#34;push-up&#34; aspect. Adhesive sticks, so that's great!
B005C2PWB8|5|This fits perfectly, true to size, looks great! No problems and arrived on time.  I would recommend to a friend.
B000LWJ1DO|5|Exactly what my husband has wanted forever. This is the underwear he had years ago and finally found them online
B002G9UDYG|4|I like the hat. Its is thick keeps you warm but it is a little to large for me. Im a big guy 280lbs with big head. But overall its a great hat.
B007IXPZSO|1|I was so excited to receive this item in the mail. However, when I put it on it was too small.  I followed the sizing instructions when I ordered the item. I was sad that the item ran small and I have to return it. Otherwise I love the simple design and the feel of the fabric. When the larger size I needed reappeared, I quickly ordered it. However, it was not the same shirt. The shirt quality was cheap and not thick as before and it actually fit smaller!
B00ULVIDMK|5|It was great!
B00IHI7LOK|3|I tried to follow the sizing very carefully.  I order a UK 8 since I normally wear a US size 4.  I couldn't even get it on, let alone close the zipper.  Might have needed to go up 2 sizes.  The material wasn't as soft and stretchable as I was hoping.  Back it goes.  No plans to reorder sizes.  Pretty print though.
B00AHOQEBI|4|These are cute pjs, I love the color and prints.  I wish they were zippered though.  The zippers ones are so much easier to put on a crying, kicking, fussy baby.
B002EB06BQ|4|The pajama is very nice but fits exavt to baby, we recommend ordering one size larger than indicated for that can be used for much longer
B00OV7OUM2|5|Love them.
B000J4BV28|5|Nice
B0079K0O5K|5|Gotten a lot of complements on this one
B00I8PN5Q0|5|Love this beanie! I was in the grocery store and saw a lady wearing it and just had to know where she got it. Unfortunately she couldn't tell me but I was able to find it through a bit of google searching and I'm so glad I did. I wore it for the first time today and received tons of compliments. It is a slouchy beanie so it will be loose fitting, it's a perfect fit if you like that style. I'm very happy with my purchase!
B00LUIMBN0|4|Read the size chart ladies it says a US large is a Chinese xlarge... But it does fit like an xlarge so order 1 size down I'd say... Its polyester and spandex so I'm going to wash n dry it before I wear it n see if it shrinks... Mine was made well
B00FBD2G2Q|5|Fits just right
B001KJCE3G|5|Thank you.
B00IU3DGC8|1|They didn't actually have it in stock even though it appears to be online and  you can purchase it only to have your money refunded and find out later that it's not coming.
B00MYCCQTU|5|Service excellent. Fits perfect.
B00CA7TR1Y|3|Only reason I don't give 5 starts is because it doesn't fit me /: has too much filling but I guess that's good for other girls hehe. I'm the size I got but the filling's so big there's no room for my boobs. Is still a really nice bra, get it one cup bigger than yours for perfect fit (:
B004BFAGZ4|5|Espectacular.
B003YXZ9JC|5|This shirt is exactly what I was looking for! First of all it is true to size and fits great. Its slim throughout the middle but definitely enough room for a broad chest and shoulders. It's super light and breathable which suited me great for Arizona summers. The material is soft and the shirt is very comfortable. The price was great from Amazon and packaging and shipping was perfect as always. The material is somewhat shiny and looks very modern. The fit also feels and looks modern. It's perfect with jeans or with a suit and tie. I highly recommend this comfortable, great fitting, and better looking shirt.
B00PK3VQLY|5|This is a very beautiful blouse and I'm thinking of getting another one soon. It fits very nice and I would recommend it.
B000E95OV2|3|The material has very little give.  I think it is much to heavy and if you are inclined to gain just a little excess weight, it is very uncomfortable.
B00T61DC4K|1|Cheap and runs way small.
B00EORQ0LS|5|This item was purchased as a baby gift and sent directly to the new mother.
B009OA4UPS|5|excellent
B00DQ3OED2|1|This thing is a complete joke. How can it even be sold for more than $10? The jumpsuit itself fits well but is very sheer. The mask is only a mask and not a helmet. The colored accents are all hand-painted and look like a 3-year-old painted it. The foam parts arrive all bent out of shape. Do not buy this, PLEASE.
B008N6Y2QG|4|I gave this hoodie to my grand daughter and she loved it. its a keeper. Be careful..it runs very small
B00JXS5WFI|4|I like this dress very much, but I definitely recommend following the sizing information in the Product Description, rather than buying your usual size, as the dress runs quite small.  I bought two sizes larger than I normally would.  As another reviewer mentioned, the elastic in the empire waist isn't quite too tight to wear, but it is very snug.  I'm 5'5\\" and the dress is just a bit too long for me to wear with flats so I'll wear small heels with it.  The print is very pretty and, overall, the dress is flattering.  I paid $30.00 and, for the price, it was a great buy!
B001BLPQ4M|3|The bad thing about is product is that whoever finds your luggage has to take the strap off the badge before they can access your contact information. That simply may give the wrong impression that only your name is on the badge without the contact info.
B00AVZ1DVE|5|The shirt fits well and the material is soft.  It's been washed a few times and has not shrunk.  The printing on the shirt is nice and looks like it will hold up fairly well. Really like the shirt.
B001JR9XQU|1|Ordered the straight leg jeans and recieved boot cut. Did'nt realize until after first wash. Will not purchase from this vendor again. Very disappointed.
B003ILT6LC|5|GREAT QUALITY! The color is perfect and you can wear this in public. This cost of this was super inexpensive and most importantly, I love it.
B001128DNC|4|Bonito Jean perfecto de largo pero las tallas son más grandes de lo que esperaba. Consideren eso a la hora de escoger la talla
B0064EYHZK|5|Pantyhose. What more can I say. One and done, so don't expect more than one wear per pair.
B00CL6HA54|4|My work outfit of pants and dress shirt is pretty boring, so I spruce things up via my socks and these are great.  They lasted as long as pairs I have.
B00BLYN9CK|2|Not a fan. Fit just is not good
B00OV8KOEO|5|Ordered this for a dear friend's birthday.  He loved it and so did we!  Thanks for such quick delivery!
B000UV5O2I|4|Came on time. And fit well. I'm 5'7 180 lbs got the large. Definitely big in stomach and all. But I have curves &#34;front and back&#34; if you get what I mean so I ordered bigger. Even if you get it smaller it won't fit like the model because it's square, not fitted.  I just needed it to go trick or treating with my friends 1 year old, so a little baggy wasn't a problem for me. Yellow belt and mask is cheap, but it worked. Didn't wear mask. Boot covers were like xsmall wouldn't even fit my shoes and arm things were way to big. Crazy size difference but I ordered 1 day before Halloween and it came, and it worked for what I needed it!
B009XFD4RE|5|Love it
B00G65CMO0|5|Really like this shirt. Searched my name and this one popped up with a few others but this one was my favorite choice of them all.
B00LFTP2IU|5|Perfect!  Husband is quite pleased.
B00SAJA8SC|2|It was not what I was expecting. Too bulky.
B00MA88JLW|1|This product was too small for my nephew to wear (16 year old Athletic build). The voice changer was good. We had to send the product
B00BT1KRFW|3|Very thick material & really wide legs. Would probably be great for cold weather lounging but I personally didn't care for them at all.
B00KXHJ8V2|5|These are nice socks. I purchased them for my 2 and a half year old son. These are a bit too large for him now (expected since I got the 3-5 year size). His shoe size is now 8.5 - 9. The colors are as pictured and he loves them; keeps taking them out and wants to wear them.<br />I wish they had a higher % of the cotton though.
B000P3ZD22|5|ok, this is NOT real leather it looks sort of like leather but it isn't you can find a piece of leather that cheep any where do your research if your looking for a genuine leather belt this isn't it if your looking for a belt to where around town and you don't have people inspecting the quality of your belt no one will notice its not genuine leather its not top notch but it does the job and looks the part
B00CQMKRIU|4|great price! very light so I took it on my European vacation. runs a bit large for me. I bought small & wear size 4.
B00W4QALVQ|4|After reading the reviews, I  went a size up. The bottom fit really well. However, the top lacks support. I feel as though I will fall out at any moment. Overall, a cute swimsuit at a decent price.
B0085YRY5C|5|Used it for a lingirie party. It was a major hit and complimented me well. I super recommend! My boyfriend loved it as well
B005N7YXZS|2|This bad will roll up a bit. To be honest, if you need this, just pony up and buy maternity clothes, which are much more comfortable.
B00286G9L8|2|These are cheaply made socks, right out of the package there are strings loose on the cuff of the sock. As many have read there are horrific stories of loose strings getting caught and wrapped around little baby toes. They do not fit as snugly as promised and my child does not have skinny feet and ankles. It took a long time to be shipped, I would not ever buy these again.
B00MTFKW52|3|Saw a close match to this sweater at Stein Mart,(same design and label), but it wasn't available in the size I needed.  Bought it online here and the white trim wasn't &#34;fuzzy yarn&#34; as the store sweater was.  Disappointed, but it was still a nice sweater for my daughter's work party.
B00N448PTC|5|Good quality -kids loved them
B00I3S7T2S|5|Great hat fits well!
B00B1P3S66|4|Good slacks with expandable waist. Product was described accurately.
B00GYT5T6Q|3|Thinner material than I was expecting. It was tight around the axillary area
B007W0VWW6|5|A nice addition
B00ESG47GU|1|Super poor quality and does not fit as expected. Have not been able to wear, but too cheap to return.
B004X95EMI|5|I bought this t-shirt a few months ago, it looked slightly different than pictured but it is very soft, comfortable and I've gotten compliments on it also...
B0063LYDKS|5|Good quality
B00OV3PBFG|4|I bought a size 16 because I have large thighs and it was a fight to get it on. I cut some parts to make it fit. I wish the waist was a alittle bit stretchy, but I can work with it. Still size up.
B005KC8NH0|5|Great colors and fit well - seem well made.  Just what I was looking for for my four month old.
B004IYIN0S|5|I tried these on as soon as I got them. I wear a size 32 on the waist and weigh 190 pounds so I ordered a Large. They're comfortable and the they fit perfect. I wore them all day and couldn't even tell I was wearing briefs. I recently made the switch from boxer briefs to briefs and these, along with the CK hip brief, are my favorite so far.  I also wore these to the gym as I like to work out 5 days a week, I like something that won't ride up, can keep the boys in place, and won't make feel restricted and these do the job. Overall, it's an awesome fit and a great style.  Oh and my girlfriend loves these too so that's a plus haha.
B00D90UKEY|4|Nice quality, not too heavy but more than warm enough. The double pockets in the front are vey nice too. It seems to run a little in large size, maybe they think you'll be wearing layers underneath. I'm a 40 regular and usually wear a large, so I figured a medium would be great for my brother who is usually wears a medium. Turns out not, I guess I got a new coat or me now =).
B00DGO1P4M|5|I am a busty curvy woman and this dress in size 14 compliments my figure. It is a gorgeous green. I am wearing to a baby shower and know I will be comfortable all day wearing this dress.
B0070TYXEI|5|The sleep shirt is comfortable and soft. Everything you expect in a sleep shirt. I would buy products from Hue again.
B00SF77NDC|4|The jewels are loosely made and fall off easy but the dress is nice and you can use no sew to glue them in.
B001FD2KMM|5|great
B000EBLQEY|3|I received it quicker than expected which was nice. Really I don't think this product is worth the $8 I paid for it but I couldn't find any of these in stores to compare prices. Not a bad belt though
B003OQTSC8|5|I received two compliments the first day I wore the sweatshirt. Everything is true to description. The weight and color are very nice.
B000P55R7Q|5|Love the white shirts. They shrink to perfect size, once washed. I have lost my unicorn, if found, stop doing drugs.
B009SJNVEG|1|I ordered this item and when I received it, it did not look as the photo. I do not think these where the same items. I am very upset!
B00E3OKGZ8|5|Great puffer jacket that I purchased as a gift for a friend's daughter.  Fits true to size and is nice quality.
B00AWDEQ5A|5|The color, fit & quality are outstanding!  Washes & tumble dries perfectly. A fine product, thank you. Price is right also.
B002ZLOIAA|4|These dress pants look very good. The pictures on the web page are very accurate and the slack fit exactly as I expected.
B005P68KDI|1|I didn't like these hairbands at all. The flower is too big and the bands are too wide for a baby's head!
B005GESO12|5|I am fully enjoying this t-shirt. It is so soft and comfortable to wear since the cotton is ringspun. It also fits very well on me. Great quality and definitely worth the price.
B00CZ50G9S|4|I like these iplay hats because they really shield kids from the sun.  This one doesn't have the little sincher in the back so it's a little bit big.  Overall, this is a great hat for a sunny day.
B00O3GVQ8M|3|It's teeny tiny.  It seemed like a preteen size not an adult size. Other than that it was great quality.
B004NPIHJE|4|This is for a Halloween costume, so it doesn't really matter for me, but if it is for regular wear customer should be advised that the sizing runs large. I wear a medium(sometimes large) from your average store and I am swimming in the size medium. The quality of the fabric is surprisingly good, for the price, though. It seems tough and durable.
B00T2HQHZ4|3|these run very small/short
B001HWA8V6|5|I bought a pair of these years ago at a festival my band played. It lasted a few years before the non-replaceable battery died. It was always a popular joke at my gigs.   I was extremely happy to come across them on Amazon and very surprised at the great package price! I now have a supply that will last a great long time and the audiences are once again pointing, laughing and grinning when I flash my teeth at them.   These would be great to give out as Halloween gifts in place of or along with the usual candy handouts.   Buy them and enjoy!
B00ULU2OW6|4|I would have preferred thicker fabric
B00JH29Q98|3|I bought this for my son who wears a 2T shirt. I ordered the 3T because I figured it would shrink a bit and I wanted him to be able to wear it for a while. After washing/drying it is about the size of an 18-24 month. We will be lucky to get a few months out of it, which is a shame since it cost me $26 with shipping. It's a cute shirt, but the quality is just ok.
B00KY554DE|5|Cute!
B00M4JD69M|5|Beautiful dress. Better than pictures! But wow is it long.  My niece is 5'5 I think you probably need to be at least 6'5 ish and wear heals or you need to get it altered! If your ok with getting it altered (3 layers) get it. Its really beautiful!
B007M6763Y|5|Nice shirt
B007O1XV0Y|4|This was a quick buy for a holiday party, as I needed something for my husband and I. It did the trick. The material isn't anything special, but it's good enough to keep in the back of the closet for another wear.
B000OKZ376|5|I buy these often at wherever I can find them for the least amount of money, this time it was amazon. They have always fit great.
B001VEIDB2|5|Got these as a work sock for my husband and they fit great and do just what he needs them for.
B00R3H9F72|4|Good
B00O9OWBJG|5|Very cute outfit-- looks great on myneice
B0070NURM6|4|My wife is 5'3&#34; and she found Medium to be a bit too big.
B003QHZ784|1|This was extremely see-through, thin fabric and not very forgiving, I returned.  I was expecting it to be a bit see-through based on reviews, but it was so bad I could not imagine wearing it.
B00KULPGRG|4|great pruduct
B005I34J4M|5|Wonderful quality at a great price!!  The fit could not be better and I am sure these gloves will last for years.
B00OL3NIBU|5|If you're looking for a heavy-duty jacket that will keep you warm in the wind, this is it!  If you're looking for a fashionable leather jacket for bumming around town, this might be a little more than you need, as it is very heavy and substantial.  Excellent craftsmanship and quality leather.  Size up, particularly if you're busty, as the jacket has a fairly straight cut and doesn't accommodate a lot on top.
B007L6IDNM|5|I love lounge pants, and these are super comfy! I end up wearing these (and other pairs I have) usually all day, every day, and love the comfort :0) I've had this pair for a couple months now, and they seem durable and well-made. Because of the fact I wear these kinds of pants every day, durability is important. A great buy!
B00CEH0MSM|3|The fit was fine but the quality of the cotton was  disappointing...not as soft as other shirts I have purchases in the past.
B005HTVUOE|4|Great set of shorts. I live in a very, very, very, hot climate.  These shorts play very well on the course.
B005DA21UY|5|Absolutely fabulous!  This dress is great by itself, but works well with my assortment of toppers!  I had pockets put into the dress when I had it shortened, but otherwise it's great!
B007WPNNGY|5|Great mostly cotton socks. Feet don't sweat. They last along time. Very comfortable.
B00EWC8QYY|5|The underwear is soft and fit perfectly.  I appreciate the elastic at the waist and legs is covered by the fabric, thereby making the underwear more comfortable to wear.  The cotton also appears to be of better quality than the other brands of underwear I own.  I have underwear made by other manufacturers in my underwear rotation but this brand and style has become my favorite.  As the other brands wear out, I will replace them with this brand and style.
B000A38CB6|5|I bought these for my grandson.  On one of the coldest days we've had - came close to breaking a record - he had to work outside almost all day and he said they were unbelieveable, they kept him warm.  He said they were &#34;awesome&#34;.  From a 20 year old young man, that's as good as it gets.  All smiles here!
B007QS8ZPQ|1|Love the look of these online but in person...they look AWFUL. That isn't the worst part. After I put them on and walked. It sounded like to grocery bags rubbing against each other. This is not because my legs rub either. I'm 5'1 & weigh 110. The sound came from the fake panel of leather. I requested to return them and never got a notice or email for a return. DO NOT BUY THESE!
B003WIZ566|4|Got here on time or early and fit snugly but not too tight. I have DVT and need non-tight uppers. These are right on the border but work.
B00CXMYKIG|3|The strings come out when washing
B00HWQQYH8|4|Good quality....very comfortable.
B00A17JYIG|5|They fit me perfectly and they feel amazing! I love them!
B003YDE4MK|4|It a nice belt but wish If it was made in the USA
B003ZYDOKQ|1|The straps on this bra are not made of a stretchy material. I have never encountered a bra with such stiff straps.  When on it is not flattering at all.  It only covers the bottom half of the breast, so you end up with boob fat hanging out over the sides of it.
B00EGNSIKQ|5|Love this shirt!  Gotten a lot of compliments on it. Had no problems with the seller or shipping speed.
B00A9WZX38|5|My son's feet are size 12 wide. He loves these socks for skiing, as there is not much space left in his ski boots. I originally ordered size XL (12-15) and had to exchange it as the XL was too large and would not fit in the ski boots. But with Amazon the whole ordeal was easy and fast.
B000Y89B94|4|We are very pleased with these pants, minimal ironing required. the price was better than we could buy locally. The pants fit well and are comfortable.
B008XCNTQY|5|Very nice quality at a wonderful price.<br />True to size.<br />Wonderful design and feel... they made a great surprise @ Christmas.<br />Thank you!
B003X26SC6|5|Very nice.  Fits my man perfectly.
B00EX9CEWG|5|I love Tok Tok bow ties! This is the second one we have purchased. This one is for Easter.
B003U2SZGG|5|The shirt is everything and more then expected. It is comfortable and the perfect length and the material is so light weight. I love this shirt!
B00H23XR5S|5|This is a very comfortable visor.  The square visor blocks more sun than a regular visor.  I have bought and worn this visor for years and have always bought them in a tennis shop.  I certainly recommend this item and am very pleased that Amazon is carrying them.
B00E5Z68W0|5|Haven't worn it yet, went on vacation and gained weight! Tried kt on when I received it, fit snug, and I wore o size 8 when I bot it, so now I have to drop 10 before I can wear it. But I loved the fit and quality!
B00G1ZW8AS|2|The design is beautiful and makes your body look slim, but there are two problems. One is that the torso is too long, we are latina complexion, and the cups are way too big even for an adult. So I had to sell it, because it didn't fit my 12 year old daughter.
B001EIQYQG|5|When I bought this crab suit, I wasn't expecting much.  But I have to say, upon donning the suit I was shocked to discover I wasn't just a man in a crab suit - I was the king of all crabs.  This suit gets incredible attention at parties, and it's reasonably sturdy.  Good quality for the price.
B00AX4KIKK|5|Good qulity, very light!!<br />I found it runs little big for my daughter(22mth) but it's really adorable!! highly recommend it!
B004ZZ6JQU|4|These are cute, but much flimsier than I thought they would be at this price. Definately a thin knit hat.
B0035XW14C|1|The dress you see on the website is not the dress you will recieve!  The dress you see on the website I purchased about 2 years ago from another company. The dress you see has wooden beads sewn into the neck line of the dress and bigger wooden beads on the draw strings on the dress.  I thought I was ordering another beautiful dress but instead I recieved a bright purple, scratchy, plain dress that was 2 size's to big!  When I called the company I was told the lady in the picture had a necklace on and there were no beads on the dress at all.  Customer's look very close to what you buy and spend your money on because shipping to return is at your expense also!
B006Q0XP46|5|Nice hat exactly as pictured
B00GTWODW4|5|I have about 6 of these skirts in different colors and patterns and I love them. They are great for church or casual wear...you can dress them up or down. The material is just thick enough to still have a great flow when you walk. I love them!!
B00OQ1FS10|5|Good quality
B00MNGNYKM|1|NOT TRUE TO SIZE
B00603WT14|4|This suit includes both a wig and a beard, so you do NOT have to buy them separately.<br /><br />The fabric is rather pink, not the dark red of the picture.<br /><br />Over all, the quality seems better than the suits I've rented in the past.
B009A117N4|1|I NEVER write reviews.  I got this belt for Christmas and was pretty stoked. Then I started researching it and found out the real story.....decent belt but for a company with so little integrity I will most likely be returning this belt. Principles mean something and I am not proud to wear this product.
B00IKAZA5M|5|will be one of my favorite go-to t-shirts
B005CSOH86|5|Wears comfortable! The cotton percentage is high, the inner surface touches really soft and smooth. Good for winter working out. I bought two
B00M0FLFKC|5|Super fast shpping and great product!  Thanks
B0072DEQ44|5|Nice wallet with plenty of room for credit cards and bills. It has soft supple leather and really looks good.
B00OQ31RAE|5|Get this for the tropics
B003L5CUB8|5|This is a great product, great service at a good price.  I will continue to purchase more items from this vender in the near future.
B00JDVH3Z2|5|I really was impressed with the quality and fit.  It met all my expectations and the price was good as well...... I would not hestitate recommending that other parents purchase this item since I would purchase this item again as my son grows older
B00ATOS29S|4|My daughter loved it. Quality was slightly worse than expected but overall finish was good and my daughter loved it.
B00TQ11WWO|5|Perfect for my 6 year old grandson!
B00AZ815A6|5|Love this top and it really is an awesome price! Fabric and design is much cuter in person. I layer it with either a cap sleeve tee or a cami, not because it's sheer, just my personal taste.<br /><br />A.  Fits true to size<br />B.  Well Made<br />C.  I suggest you hang dry.  After several washes, it still looks like new.  The fabric is such that if it was machine dried, it would get some major \\"pulls/snags\\" and the lace on the hem would fray and pill.<br />D.  Perfect length<br /><br />I liked it so much, I bought it in all colors
B00GSWZLRQ|4|REALLY BRIGHT!
B00QGBIE46|5|A great jacket vest for the money.  I like to wear it indoors in a chilly house.  Lack of sleeves permits free arm movement, without the underarm perspiration caused by a sleeved garment.
B008OADTNI|5|my son looked so adorable in the suit.<br />I taught it would be a little small but it fit perfect.
B000FQE4WE|3|I am a size 8 in pants and I felt like this thong was too small.  The universal &#34;thong goal&#34; is not to have it dig into your sides, right?  Because that defeats the purpose of not having a visible panty line, if everyone can see it digging into your hips.  But these do.  They needed to be a little looser so they wouldn't roll and dig in.  I feel like &#34;one size fits all&#34; should encompass a size 8.  Maybe I just have especially squishy hips.
