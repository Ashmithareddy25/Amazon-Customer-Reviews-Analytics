B00QRFYIFK|3|They fit fine and it's nice to have the 14x1.5 threads so they match my swapped front axle. BUT a very tough issue I'm dealing with is that on a 2500 rear axle they use 9/16-18 studs. Which I cannot find a nut smaller than a 7/8 socket to fit. And a 7/8 socket WILL NOT fit in these spacers. So I've yet to get them to work and had to order another pair from a different vendor that had the holes large enough to fit a 7/8 socket in. I also tried multiple brands of sockets, and none fit.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Temp gun works as promised. Battery life is still going strong after 4+ months
B000C55W24|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B005NBS4VI|5|perfect for my truck window
B00842A7F4|5|What can be said -- new rivets are better to have than no plugs and old beat up plugs.  Used on Honda CRV front shrouds.
B005UD6CGS|5|Was exactly what I was looking for - great price and fast shipping.  Thanks.
B0075DNBG0|5|Excellent product, shipping was a little pricey.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Its a terminal connector and it works
B0023015DG|5|Awesome filter and very reasonable price
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Actually a really good buy. $20 even for a pair of incandescent lights is cheap. The light from these is a blue/purple color. They are small and bright. I mounted them behind the grill in my mud truck. they look amazing and have some weight to them. They seem like they will stand the abuse from my truck for years and if not, they were only 20 bucks.
B008G33564|4|My order was kinda weird I guess the head lights shipped from two different places and two different carriers. There was about a week in between the deliveries. They look great installed but I kinda wish there was a core charge so I could send my old ones in rather than toss them in the garbage!
B0002MAIM6|3|The PIAA Pt No. 30034 Sw. Arrived earlier than forecast, it took two weeks and not three. However, I have some concerns the Sw. is the correct basic Switch, but;<br />1. It has not got the waterproof sleeve on that it replaces.(it is a lighting Sw.for a Motorcycle).<br />2. The wiring plug on the harness was the wrong type for the 34085 harness it was to attach to and had to be replaced with the old plug from the old Sw.<br />So not happy with the PIAA Pt. No. System to correctly identify their parts, but have made it work at some extra expense.
B00029WYEY|5|Comes with the necessary amount needed for servicing a standard cone style K & N filter.  You should be able to get two full usages from the kit since you don't have to service these filters often. I would definitely recommend the aerosol style can over the pour liquid.  Thanks
B00GBR9OJY|5|Awesome product a must have fits perfect no problem
B00NOXPOA6|4|Looks like the original. I the it should be a bit les in price since its OEM. But works great. Easy to install.
B001GH1PTG|4|Money well spent and would buy again. Fits like a glove and is so sturdy, that you can lift the jack by the handle with this device securing the top to off the handle to the rail.<br /><br />My only issue was that the device gets in the way when you are jacking the handle up and down (48&#34; Hi-Lift). I had to remove it completely to get the full swing of the handle.
B007CJUAVQ|5|Smells great and great price!
B000BKIGPU|5|I love this creeper due to the ingenious architecture of its design. You see, the wheels on the end opposite the headrest are set very near the edge of the creeper. Thus, when one is easing down on the end of the creeper, the headrest end doesn't tilt up in the air. Nor does it flop down with a crash.<br /><br />Well done. sirs!
B006B28PKS|5|Works great on my 2012 spyder can-am. Would buy again!
B000GZT3IO|5|Best of any and all automobile cleaners, especially for RV's.  You don't even need to rinse.  Great water saver!  I have been using it for over 5 years.
B004GC704M|4|ordered for a friend fit like a champ shes happy so i am happy
B002M3KSK0|4|Works great, fits Mazda CX-9 well without sticking out on both sides, however, a good amount of wind noise.
B0090B7M2O|1|Does not work on all systems in Audi & BMW.  Cannot connect to all control modules (like electronics, radio & nav) and is hit or miss on which ones it can access.  Updates are extremely slow - can take 2 hours or more for a full update.  I found out too late (after the Amazon 30 day return period) that the item sold to me by a seller called Motorzone and fulfilled by Amazon was not new and likely not genuine (gray market). The unit had already been registered 7 months before I bought it by someone else so my warranty on the item from Autel only had 5 months left.  When I contacted Autel they told me the sellers on Amazon are not authorized therefore they would not honor the warranty anyway. They told me it might not be a genuine Autel unit. So the item is used, may not be genuine, has no warranty and doesn't fully work to expectations and I cannot return it to Amazon.  That's a ZERO star in my book.
B0057FU4H2|5|works well it is a little longer than stock one.
B0048J1M6A|5|good
B001G0ETLE|1|Nothing but problems since day 1. Had the system professionally installed. The remotes don't work right and if you try to open the door with the key the alarm sounds.
B0096U2W9W|5|These are, by far, the brightest lights I've had experience with.<br />I needed to brighten up the rear lights on my Motorcycle and these definitely did it.
B00AO6ENJE|5|I would totally recommend this helmet. I got this to replace the three quarters helmet that came with my scooter. I was concerned about typical full helmets because I wear larger glasses, so this helmet is fantastic because I can take it off and on without removing them provided I open it up first.<br /><br />The fit is as expected. To those getting helmets that are too big/small, IGNORE THE SIZES. S/M/L/XL means something different to every manufacturer, my 60cm head was an extra large in my last helmet, but just large in this one. Figure out your head measurement either based on helmets you already know fit, or by trying them on in the store, then google &#34;ls2 ff386 size chart&#34; to see which size you fall into.
B00TA62M1K|1|I had the same problem, with the tabs not being thick enough to catch in the holes, to lock the cover in place. They should've made a bigger taper on the end of the tabs, so that they would lock in place. Now I'm looking like a clown, when I'm out! This thing hangs down, because it &#34;will not&#34; stay locked into place. Very disappointed in this product....
B0093E8SRG|5|It fits a 2000 wrangler se.
B000182E5K|4|Nice look good fit
B00M78820I|5|I love it.  It took a couple minutes of confusion as how to refold it to get it back in the bag but once I figured it out I thought it was ingenious!  I also really appreciate the fact that it has clips and comes in a bag that keeps all intact when not in use. Love it.
B00WL0AXDG|5|Great product easy to follow instructions , use existing holes and nut inserts in rocker panel  .Use  socket set  for  simple bolt on product. Some Mechanical ability needed . Nice fit and finish .
B00353PWAW|5|Always suds.  Good lubricity when washing.  Feels good after too!
B00MRJKF6Q|5|Prefect. But wish they were the first original grey
B00757KJTI|4|Works as good as the oem I replaced. Looks better also👍
B00UAK3ZUC|1|This product is expensive and for J-B Weld, it should be an embarrassment at best. I couldn't hold two tooth picks together. I have children's glue that is a better product.
B001O0TZBU|5|installed these into a 2005 camry without problems.
B000760FWU|5|tres bon produit merci
B00480BWCI|1|I used these almost daily on a 12 day vacation.  The first day they were great, but the more I used them, the more they &#34;broke down&#34; and lost their shape.  It got to the point that they were so out of shape, they would no longer hook together.  Save your money, go to Lowes, Home Depot, Menards, etc. get some 2X12s and cut them to the length you would like.
B00WJI7DFQ|5|Fits my 2014 jeep JK perfectly.
B00R1T6KNE|5|perfect match.Highly recommend.
B00412YPV8|5|Exact fit replacement for a 2003 Honda CRV.  A couple minor differences from the original:  the cap is different and it did not have the metal bushing in the upper mounting hole.  I just transferred the metal bushing from the original to the new reservoir.
B011WZSSXM|5|very nice for the price.
B00DCULNXS|1|There was no instructions or information just the parts you're on your own to figure out how they work
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Looks nice, cool to have a place for tissue box as well. Great overall.
B001KO4UQU|4|Seems descent. The only thing in this kit is O-rings and some boots. it works great. I was hoping it came with pistons of course I'm sure some where it actually does describe what comes in the kit. The kit is high quality and exact fit though.
B002R0MWWU|4|worked fine 05 Gr Cherr Jeep
B00Q3CM2QY|5|Another great product by Battery MINDer. The desulfation feature is what sets this companies chargers apart. If you have a tired old battery, try desulfation. Leave the charger on it, and forget about it for a while. I left it on one for over 3 months and had great results. Not a miracle worker for every battery, but if light to moderate sulfation has occurred, it can be reversed, It takes quite a while, but it works.<br /><br />Battery MINDer's chargers are self regulating and you will not over charge a battery. I have just had great luck with them. The 1510 is a low amp version I use on my quad battery (or other small 12V batteries). I would suggest the larger version for car batteries if you are doing any type of in car charging or need a quick charge. If you use AGM batteries (which I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend), get the AGM specific charger.<br /><br />Great, fully regulated chargers, at a reasonable price.
B009UHHOV2|5|It's a bell. It's made of metal. And it has this design on it.
B00266BS8E|5|I bought this as a hook.  By that, I mean I wanted people to know my truck has a V-6.  Where I live, there is a lot of impromptu 0-60 racing at the stop lights on the 4 lane, very rural, highway.  What most of these rednecks don't know is that my V-6 is the twin turbo EcoBoost.  It looks good and is stuck on there hard.
B00V6R36X4|5|Fast delivery and good quality carburetor
B00GSAUHB8|2|Product will block the sun well enough.  The problem is that in order to get full coverage, they have put additional fabric outside the 2 ringed sections.  The front window in my car is larger than then sunshade's ringed footprint, so when you flip your visors forward to hold the sunshade in position, they only catch on the fabric section outside the rings.  The fabric is not able to hold against the visors, so they sunshade falls down every single time.  I'm sure it would work better in a smaller front window, but I drive a Ford Focus, so I imagine there are larger windows out there.<br />There is no defect in the product, it just simply isn't large enough to hold in place in my window.
B00QGPKFGW|5|Fits perfect in the 2015 Honda Fit. Love it.
B002R0Z26S|5|Right part, great fit. Delivered quickly and great value. Thanks!
B00S75DI4U|5|just plan awesome very good machine work on these
B00X7HS5LY|5|I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&#34;  I was so glad that I got my new sunshade just before my husband and I took a trip to Florida. Boy we sure did need one it was hot there that weekend. It cover the hold windshield witch we liked. We had bought another and for some reason it just did not cover all of the windshield. It keep our car cooler and did not fall down, which is another problem we had other sunshades. Would recommend it item.
B001L9VTMW|3|It stays on.
B00TGCHEAM|5|Already had exhaust, and fp3 installed. Didn't think it would be much of a noticeable gain. I was wrong. Broke the rear loose in 2nd on new tires. Brought back the evil giggle factor to my bike. Made the exhaust note sound deeper and a bit more meaner.
B000C2WF9A|5|NO PROBLEMS!!
B0082365AQ|1|You get what you pay for on this item.  The strap that is included in this is worthless.  The cheap plastic clip broke the first time used the item.  So now I use a ratchet strap.  I haul a 13ft kayak that is 33in wide.  Even with the ratchet strap the kayak slips off the cart.  Works on completely flat ground that is smooth, if you plan on going up a hill, through grass, or any kind of bumps, plan on your boat slipping off.  Complete junk,  I feel sorry for myself
B003ILGY7G|5|These mats are great, Fan Mats the masses will know that you sell  quality product for us Raiders fans tthanking
B000S2SKCK|3|Got one that was not working right. They sent me a new one. But it should have work right the first time.
B00AQB3KLO|4|Fit fine, improved design similar to the Moog problem solver part.<br /><br />It does get very close to something on the left side, but it doesn't interfere.<br /><br />Would buy a again.
B002SS5ZDO|5|Supper product for use on the car.
B006FUT05U|5|The ease of application is amazing.  After it rains or when water is applied, it  beads like I never seen paint  bead before
B00K0MKPLM|5|What can I say....it's a bell for a motorcycle. It was a gift & they loved it.
B00KLFPQ7G|5|fits right &works well!!
B00W57F2UY|3|Have'nt used it because  the barbs R 2 small, but will keep it n get a next one
B007NGB3GY|5|Just received this vest and had to comment on how gorgeous it is. The leather is very soft and fits perfect I am a 34 D and 130 lbs and bought a small.
B008W3GHD6|5|👍
B00VKM3WAC|5|The car cover is well made and works well. I haven't had any problems with durability and the fit on my Ford Explorer is good. The cover is easy to put on and take off and stores fairly compactly. I don't secure the cover to the car as the bottom is elastic but it has grommets for that if you wanted to. I wasn't expecting the cover to be that nice for the price but it seems as though it will last for a while.
B00RJUZY9Q|1|It would be good holder if I could use it with one hand. There is now way because it moves. You have to use two hands and it is not very practical while driving. There are other double holders that work better than this.
B00B1H9KNY|5|Even though picture didn't match description, the right part was delivered and it fit perfectly.  Definitely recommend!
B0000AY4YT|5|Good
B00HJR6F3I|5|At the auto garage they wanted to charge me $45 just for pretty much the same filter.  This one fits perfect and no issues.  Looks exactly like the one that came with the car.
B00YT57MNA|5|I was looking for this type of a car garbage container for my Sedan; the flaps mold closely to the back seat hump to prevent the container from falling over. I know some reviews reflected negative opinions, but they are not made for SUVs, since their backseat hump is so much higher and wider; they are made especially for the Sedans.
B0024E6F7W|5|Just what I thought they would be
B000CQ249C|5|great product and fast service!
B00753S8CC|5|Bought for a friend as a Christmas gift. She said that she loved it, it was very unique and easy to apply.
B00AI749QG|2|AGM Battery type not printed on the battery anywhere. Is it an AGM battery??? Battery posts are not lead construction (shown in the picture.)<br />Instead, the posts are made of thin sheet metal of some kind. There is a reason lead is used for the terminals. Corrosion resistance. It is currently working fine. Longevity will be the question.
B004RNR9BY|4|Very good hose
B004J3A9E6|3|NOT ALL THE PARTS NEED A VERY JET YOU NEED
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Very soft and luxurious on the long pile side of this cloth, and it's a 70/30 blend of polyester and polyamide...which is a lot more polyamide than many other cloths I've tried. I am very pleased with the soft banding around the perimeter of the cloth too.This is actually softer than a more expensive cloth that I recently bought. With the Amazon pricing this is now my favorite polishing cloth.
B009ANV81S|5|Really good quality connector.<br /><br />Mounted it in sheet metal, and looks and feels like quality.
B007P722QQ|5|Great job
B007S12XCW|5|Great pegs but the teeth are a little too sharp, they will cut you. I knocked them down a little with a file and all is good.   Installed on my DRZ400SM.
B003VGHB9I|5|perfect fit and easy to install
B00YI3IGA6|5|I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....<br /><br />This ShadeSox Universal Fit Car Side Window Baby Sun Shade is great.  These slip onto the side windows to help cut the glare of the sun. It also protects your kids by reducing the heat that beams in from the sun.  They easily went onto my Chevy Malibu. The ShadeSox wraps around the exterior of the door frame. The material is very flexible. You can roll down the window and still have shade. These are awesome
B00P87W0IU|5|Absolutely an amazing product.  I am now a convert!
B001PY708U|5|Happy with this product.
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Expensive, but awesome!  If I could afford it I would replace all batteries with this.  You will not believe how light the are and how much power they have.
B00DBHD7R2|5|GREAT
B00HAQBEH0|5|Super bright and super useful.  I use this in server rooms.  It magnet-attaches just fine to standard racks and lights up the front or back.  Really great for cabling.  You can also put it in your pocket and turn it on.  Girls love it.
B00J5KRUHM|5|We bought this as we were embarking on a 5,000 mile road trip, hoping to control the clutter while we spent long hours in the car. I have to say, this product really helped. It was large enough to hold a typical day's trash and was spill proof, so bottles and cans were no problem. I just emptied it and wiped it down every morning as we hit the road.  It has a stable base, so it never tipped over during the trip. It has a lid that we never closed, but some people may like. And finally, you can remove the plastic inserts when you're done and the unit becomes flat for storage. The StableMate Trash Basket did everything we hoped it would.
B00LOZFCNU|5|Bought this for my mom's car as she had place for a plate in front but didn't want the dealership's plate there. Looks great and has held up well in a couple car washes. Several people have complimented her on her new car and the cute plate. What a great way to show we love animals and that our family rescues!
B003V57NUQ|4|Worth the low price. Easy to assemble and sturdy enough and easy to mount to the cross bars of my cars roof rack.straps are serviceable but not great. As other reviewers said, go get some inexpensive ratchet straps at your local home center and your go good to go
B006U6MO84|4|Does not fit Hyundai Elantra 2003 gt
B000C704Z2|5|Installed with new Raybestos 980752R rotors.  Stopping power increased dramatically.  Good fit.
B0081SBYPI|5|Fits great and looks good on my commander
B00YI3IGA6|5|Wow!  These are fantastic.  I have a car that has tinted windows, however my son loves to have his window down but hates the sun in his eyes.  This solved the problem perfectly.  They fit my 2012 Kia Optima perfectly and the material is very high quality.  I plan on ordering another set soon for my wife's car.  Definitely a recommended product!  And of course Amazon Prime never disappoints.  I received these less than 48 hours after I ordered.
B001R4JHRA|5|Very minimalist but functional. 5 minute installation for each. Solid and very sturdy. I bought 4 for my truck. Only con, it also came w/ 4 different keys...but I'm not complaining : )
B008SEM724|5|Great deal and they came with more powerful bulbs than stock..can tell the difference and I was skep6on the purchase
B009DK0WOW|5|This is for the lower bumper.  Quality part and fitment is great.
B00SFKMN8O|5|Work as advertises,fit my Optima and saved my phone from falling out of my pocket between the seat and middle console a few times already...
B00M6I7CA0|5|Works perfectly in my 2011 C300. Very happy customer.
B000GS18PC|5|Excellent
B000E4NKEK|5|Works great
B00I0Z14AW|5|Great kit if you are not sure what you need. It comes with everything you need to do the job right!!!!
B002G29KLK|5|Works great. Thanks!
B001UHQXQ2|5|another great product for the vehicles.  gets grease and grim off of them
B000BUU5YU|5|Seems to be good quality and it works great without getting hot.
B00HE68ESI|5|good
B00IF9I6PO|5|Perfect for adding that fictional extra boost to your car, motorbike or-in my case-lawn mower.
B00T9ONSC0|5|Fit perfectly, works as intended, good price. Doesn't seem to be as powerful as the OEM starter, but this starts the engine just fine.
B0041TGN2K|5|it fits and it works. GREAT!
B00873J0YY|1|Missing critical parts.
B00QN1W7N8|5|Purchased for my jetta '13 they look great. Plus the install was quick and easy.
B000CKOWUM|1|not happy about it at all. I took it to my shop for them to install and after only a week there was a leak coming from it.
B00CGTVCIC|5|nice
B000DINKPQ|5|[[VIDEOID:a755965f7b4c05bbc5039d821dd09041]] Great sound when paired with the FIAMM 72102.<br /><br />Remember, pair the 72102 (High) with the 72112 (Low).<br /><br />Nice replacements for broken horns or horns that sound too weak.<br /><br />Still working strong after 3 years.
B010VUZDC8|5|Very nice for the price
B007Z8VG30|5|Thanks
B001CF6MB8|5|Excellent quality for just a little extra money. Highly recommend and very pleased.
B00II3SE40|2|I like the idea very much, But after just 8 hrs. of operation 2 bulbs have several diodes not emitting light<br />the defective ones still put out a good amount of light and. For now I'm moving them to a place I don't need as much light and possible return for defective exchange.<br /><br />More later
B00M9MJJQI|5|Fits and looks great easy to install
B000CPIEN8|5|Very good product, I suggest you paint the metal fittings to prevent rust.
B001IN5KYO|5|This product is an amazing value, I bought 4 of these and the matching Backer Plates. Amazon had the best price, the shipping was $ 100 for 4 of these, just an FYI. Included in the box was all new bearings, wheel seals, backer plate studs & nuts, plus lug nuts. They were great quality, everything fit perfectly and easy to change. By far the best online experience I have ever had.
B00PKRK7DS|5|Very fast delivery!  I was surprised for the low price I paid how sturdy this was.  It folds up very small for storage when not in use. I wish I could buy another for our other car but they are out of stock.
B008ND40AW|4|Worked fine on my '99 chevy 2500.  The only problem I had was the plastic clips that hold the latch rods were installed backwards.  I was able to pop them out and install them the correct way.  Made a big difference in tailgate operation.  4 stars because the clips were assembled incorrectly.
B008F8Q8K0|5|brand new
B0041ZOENY|4|I'm planning on getting my motorcycle license after taking a course at Harley Davidson, and I needed a helmet to take the course.  I really like the look, style, and price of this helmet.  It also feel durable enough, although I don't have much experience with motorcycle helmets.  I bought a large and it was too small, so I'm attempting to return it to buy an XL, but Power Gear Motorsports hasn't contacted me yet, it's been 5 days and they were supposed to contact me within the first 48 hours.  So I just sent in another return address, and we'll see what happens with that.
B003BDW0TM|5|Easy install
B00TRCPUG6|1|It doesn't work, don't waste your money!
B00D0MEUZG|4|Works well, can't beat the price. Unfortunately it is made out off a pot metal and the handle is not adjustable, but at this price what else would you expect. I bought this for my daughters bike and the span from the throttle to the handle was a bit to much for her reach. So I tried to bend it in and I broke off the handle. Fortunately I was able to Frankenstein in the handle off of her original part and it has worked great ever since.
B005HEJ1Z4|5|Rock solid build quality with plenty of useful features. I am using 3 of them all the same on 3 different motorcycles. Best tank bag I have ever had in my riding career
B0020T17J2|5|Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!
B003JSHQW0|5|I have had this charger for a few months now and it is working perfectly. Because of its smart charging circuits, I don't have to worry about over charging my battery. I check it after it has charged a couple of hours and then unplug it. There is no need for me to continue to keep the charger energized once the battery is fully charged. It does not lose much of a charge between uses. But it is nice to know that I can leave it energized, just in case I forget and it would not hurt the battery. The manufacturer recommends that you do not leave the battery and charger un attended. I know that they must say that to cover themselves, but any kind of equipment could fail at some point, so it is just wise to check on things. But that said, I have a lot of confidence in this product based on its performance thus far. And it is waterproof. My charger is out side in a container that is fairly waterproof, but not fully. My battery is running a pump, so water is involved. Don't have to worry if a little water splashes on the charger. All is well
B000QQXAGE|5|So far so good. Will see for how long.
B00WOT3YM6|5|Very easy to use, and works well.
B00RM327NG|4|Bought this to keep my iPhone 6 visible in my car with Bluetooth.  it does what it says, magnetically connects the iPhone to the holster, and is very convenient.  The only issue I have is that the metal could scratch the back of the iPhone, so I just taped it (with regular packing tape) to the inside of my case and I feel better that it won't damage my device.<br /><br />Super convenient, provided your vents aren't angled weird to view the iPhone properly.
B0012WKCNK|5|Doesn't quite fit in the new hitch. Need scim to make it stop moving around
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Great product as advertised.
B002XM5G70|5|grate pump, good pressure
B00EZH938E|5|Cute
B00QW3KIHO|5|just installed it for my neighbor, fits great and it's all metal.
B0099AQMBI|4|Perfect fit but wish they would include new screws as my old ones need replacement
B009DIYB6E|5|Between this and the spectra Throttle body spacer, I went from 7.5mpg to 11.6mpg in town on my 2000 Excursion V10 4v4.  Im very happy!!
B009I33SDQ|5|Best filter you will ever find and it helps to increase fuel mileage
B003M6HCL4|2|They look good on the bike, but the top and lever fall off easily.  I just put them on yesterday, took my bike out for a ride, and noticed that the tops are already gone.  I wouldn't buy this product again!
B00EAOJDL4|5|Nice decal! Very unique and adds personality to my van. Thanks!
B000IDYKQO|5|Essential for everyone.
B005C5EO96|5|Great product
B002WTUCYG|5|It's a gasket. It fits great. It's easier to order online than to drive to the store.
B001FEOTN4|5|I added a dirt bike carrier to the back of my jeep via a trailer hitch mount. The TJ suspension was way too soft to support the weight of my XR650R and my son's XR80R. With the bags, I can air them up to 35 psi, load the bikes, and make the one hour trip to our favorite spot. I have the ride rite on my Dodge Ram Truck as well, and they changed the way I pull my 14k # 5th wheel for the better!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works equally well in my F-150 as it does in a new Honda Accord.  Easy to use and really cuts down the Texas heat in my black-on-black truck.  Recommended.
B000COB8FA|5|Beautiful finish just the correct size for the location works great
B005NLQAHS|3|Seems to work fine, I'm only using it with the free app it says to use, I haven't tried it with the paid app or any other free app for that matter.  My car has been working fine so I can't really say if it's a good device or not, but for what the free app offers, it communicates well and displays everything correctly.  I recommended you get your app first and see if this device is compatible before purchasing this device expecting every app to work.
B00681BDXI|1|Quit working after 2 months, tried new batteries and still nothing.  Even when it did work it was limited to about 20 feet.
B00HRY1UJW|4|I hope 1570 shocks fits my 1990 Geo Tracker (4 wheel drive ??) we will see, then I will write a review on them !! I will order them with in a week !
B000J2ERSK|5|I love the wheel spinner it's very smooth on the hand and the nose doesn't stab your hands will buy another for my other vehicle from the same saler
B000CIPIMA|4|I just purchased it a couple of days ago for my 02 Tj 4.0 5-speed, and here is my review. First off the kit doesn't look like the picture. The exhaust tip isn't a turn down but a big oval tip. I like it a lot better than the one pictured. The tail pipe coming from the muffler is not the one piece like the picture, but two pieces. I personally didn't like that aspect. That's one more joint to clamp. I had a tough time getting it all positioned correctly. In the end the tail pipe was way too close to the rear shock. That could be because I have a 4-in lift or some other variable. Because it was so close to the shock, I had to put a small relief with some heat and a 3-lb sledge. That I didn't like. The second to last step in the instructions state that the joints should be tack welded in addition to the clamps to prevent it from coming dislodged. I used my Tig welder to tack it all in place and I welded the tip rather using to clamp that was provided.  Overall the installation was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. Now lets talk sound!  I love it. It has a nice deep tone when you fire it up and it just sounds great going threw the gears. When you get to cruising speed it quiets down to a nice low tone.  If I had it to do over again I would fully weld up the the entire tail pipe section that way I would only have one joint to clamp and tack in place. The shock and tail pipe contact might have been a deal breaker for me had I known.
B00MEVPQLG|4|It is a great product just that the capacity is bigger to charge more power hungry devices. These days we move about with more than one device and though it charges faster, it has been a great tool to other power banks that I have.
B004BOH6BM|5|So good! These things are amazing!  So I recently got a cat and I'm the kind of person who loves pets but I'm not a big fan of the odors that are associated with them.  So I searched all over the internet in search of something that would help cut down on these odors and I found these.  Not only did it cut down on the order but it COMPLETELY eliminated the smell from the area that I have the litterbox and the his food area.  I would honestly recommend these to anyone and they last for an extremely long time so you can't go wrong with this item especially at the pricing point.
B00NJK9O3C|4|I installed this on the driver's side of an older Saturn Vue.  I also installed a cheaper brand (Pylon) wiper blade on the passenger side of the same car.  Both were equally easy to install.  The blade portion appeared to be made of the same quality rubber though the steel of the Bosch brand did seem to be a bit heavier gauge. Both blades are quiet and clean equally well.  I have installed these in the middle of summer so I will update this review as time goes on to see which of these two blades lasts longer.  The Bosch costs about $2.00 more than the Pylon brand so it is roughly 30% more costly.  I will update this review to see if the Bosch is worth the extra money.
B000CITK8S|5|works as expected.  price and product both are good.
B00O4HMIKA|5|Simple to install (you have to get under the car) but has been installed for 3 weeks with no apparent problems. Great price!!!!
B006Z59ABY|5|Cool tool!
B009ZNZ7VU|1|These are complete garbage, not worth buying at all. Poor quality wires, shoddily assembled. Any continuity at all would have to be considered coincidental. I had to go through every one of them and re-crimp them to the clips in order to get the metal of the wires to touch the metal of the clips. They should have been soldered, but the wires are such poor quality I didn't feel it was worth any more of my time or effort beyond just crimping. I put my multi-meter on continuity and tested each wire. With the multi-meter tips touching the display reads 0.0, but with any of the wires in between it never read below 1.0. After re-crimping each wire the best reading I could get was 0.4, but it was uniform with each wire. Speaking of the wires, they look to be about 10-12 gauge based on the external size of the insulation. Once I took them apart to fix them, the actual size of the wire strands looked to be 18-20 gauge at best. Now that I've read other reviews I think I need to double check the hinges on each clip. They all seemed to be working, but I suppose they could come apart at any time.<br />The raw materials were bought, assembled, packaged, and shipped from China all for $3. That alone should tell you all you need to know. Unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention to avoid this, but for $3 I guess I live and learn...
B001OMVCIC|5|Want to thank Maury, outstanding post. Took me about a hour beginning to end. We'll see how they work with the trailer on. 2013 Express 4wd, 5.7
B000BRF3VS|5|I bought two of these to replace the vents in my Vintage 1979 Airstream Renovation.<br />They work great!.  The installation is tricky in the Airstream and I have made a youtube video on how to install it:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2gDJQT0YqI  (copy and paste)<br />Over all Very Happy with this product!
B001UC729O|5|So I bought one back in 4/14 for a 99 F350 to get an amperage boost. It failed after about 10 months. And while I may have been pretty upset that it failed, working with Bosch and Amazon made the replacement pretty easy. Interestingly, the 1st replacement came damaged and was unusable (broken mounting bracket), but the 2nd replacement has been working strong. I've always been a bit concerned how to do replacements for items like this, but not anymore. Hats off to Bosch and amazon for doing this about as right as one can.
B0015DOPDE|5|Great, Low cost AC Machine. This is a perfect non-automatic machine. I buy tons of these nationally. Good cost effective solution.
B0024FOTOW|3|More wobbly than I would prefer, but it holds my kayak in place. My kayak is a bit short, so it is impossible to secure the back end onto the support and then rotate the kayak's other end to the roof support. This probably works better for the canoe's it is advertised for.
B00H7LPKKU|5|This locking grease coupler is expensive but worth it. I gave this a try after fighting fittings popping off the awkwardly placed zerks under my motorhome and this thing actually works. No longer have to push and hold the fitting in place while filling zerk. Buy an air grease gun as well to avoid having to pump the gun. This coupler and an air gun make a terrible job tolerable.
B00S8F3S1C|5|Great
B00Y75QZFI|5|I really love this smart Car Kit by by Eco Breeze and Smart Charge.<br /><br />The kit contains:<br />- &#62;  Car Air Purifier Freshener: The car ionizer is an innovative and patented product which utilizes the latest anion technology to achieve the best air purification result.<br />&#60;&#62; HOW DOES IT WORK &#60;&#62;  The ionizer creates negative ions which seek out positively charged particles, such as dust, dander, bacteria, pollen, mold, smoke, chemical vapors, and other allergens and then, once the positive and negative ions are bonded together, they become too heavy to float, and no longer affect the air quality of the surroundings, and this way it will eliminate almost every poisonous factor or any kind of pollution in the air of your car or your home.<br /><br />- &#62;  Smart Charge USB Car Charger and Car 12v socket :  The car charger has dual USB ports and one 12v socket. You can use all three ports simultaneously.It has over-load, over-voltage, over-heated, over-current and short circuit protection. The charger is very stylish, portable and durable.<br /><br />- &#62;  ECO Breeze AIR Freshener: The kit also include eco friendly air freshener, you can hang it under the car seats or the backup mirror, It clears the bad odor and smell nice.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  It was packed nicely in a foam padded great looking case. ( Makes it Ideal for Gift ). The shipping was also very fast. It was delivered in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable, luckily i bought it at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am very happy with the purchase. It a total package with dual charger, air purifier and air freshener. I sure i high quality product and i highly recommend this smart car kit by Eco Breeze and Smart Charge. Below are few pictures of the smart kit that i took.
B0033MEHEC|4|Great product but the direction are terrible!  If write in a better way this is a 15 minute job.  First they explain that if using on a 2012 then use spacers , ok how about 13,14,15?  Had to ask a question.  Then the plastic covers over the hinge, what size hole should I drill, I made it 1&#34;dia.  this was so you can fit the flat washers with the spaces.  All  the photos show the spare tire on NO GOOD take it off first thing!  Also they show photos of the hinge without the covers on,  well when your done drilling the holes put them right back on, the rest is pretty easy just look at the digram and put all washers & spaces as shown. The top left bolt on the hinge should be a bit longer.<br />Thats the only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star, this thing is very well made!!<br />Joe T
B00DHGPVKI|5|This thing is small and packs a punch when it comes to charging up old batteries of all types. I've used it on marine batteries, motorcycle batteries, optima yellow-top batteries, and lightweight car racing batteries. I can't say enough about how fast and great this works.
B00TBHXC4E|4|This product surprised me when it arrived because the label said it was for boat seats.  That isn't what the ad said.  But I figured vinyl is the same regardless.  So I used it on my daughter's old Ford.  It applied easily enough.  I have to be careful to not spray too much, but I got it right eventually.
B00JS3E754|5|Factory spare tire fit exactly where it should fit with tool carrier & tools needed for a possible tire change. All of the &#34;Tire mobility Kit&#34; has to be removed before spare is installed. Very good complete change over nothing missing.
B000LQ78YY|5|Great transaction - items as described - fast shipment!  Thank you!
B00CAKIN0M|5|Needed trimming even though it was an application specific purchase, no big deal as it trims easily
B003TTL0TE|5|Love this thing
B00DV2U4QO|2|Nice reproduction everything is like original but make sure you order the correct one cause they make 2 or more differant heads one with center valve cover bolts and one with outside valve cover bolts. I ordered this one thinking its what i needed cause this is the only one shown on amazon. Now i learned they have differant ones. But you have to go directly to kumar or ebay to find the correct one.
B00480BWCI|1|After first use the blocks were so crushed they would no longer stack.  These blocks simply can not take the weight of my small 24 foot motorhome.  I bought these to save weight, but I will now go back to plywood squares until I can personally examine another product before I buy!
B00F4MQJ5O|1|Got light and hooked up to battery worked all lights lit up so I took the lens of to silicone it up since on other reviews they get moisture in them and I'm putting on a airboat let it dry tested light again and they all worked took about 3 hours to build some brackets for it mounted it up and hooked it up and 10 bulbs didn't light up then about 10 seconds later 10 more go out now it's got 20 out wasted alot on time sealing it up and making brackets for a light that doesn't work
B00480BWCI|4|Need more than one 10 pack
B00FSG3DTG|5|GREAT PRODUCT FOR RV APPLICATIONS
B00LDRA342|5|Love this kit because it's easy to install and they are killer bright compared to my stock halogens.  I changed out my H11 low beams and fog lights to the 10000k Deep blue and I can't get enough of it.
B0009V4GAK|1|did not fit
B00GFCAZKC|5|Perfect!
B00FWOKJYG|2|They ended up being both flood not spot. Also one let's in lots of moisture.
B00K6976RK|1|August 12 2015<br />Sale two to get one working!!<br />AN
B003UM0IUW|5|Easy install, fit well and look good
B00DC4PDLC|3|A fine socket, But...if you remove the bulb when energized it will short out, guaranteed.
B007O5GXYG|5|Simple plug in installation with GM adapter. Easy mounting with the help of a YouTube video and adjustment for my set up was a breeze. Just got home from first trip and my trailer handled well with great braking performance. I have a 2005 silverado 1500 and pull a &#34;trail lite&#34; 22 foot trailer.☺
B00BOVDCPE|1|The worse product made. It won't stay in place and keeps falling down no matter what I do. Waste of money.
B001JT1CEE|3|cheap wire but gets the job done
B000QUXYXE|5|Works as well as the original hinge, but will probably last longer.  Installation was really easy, a perfect fit.
B0054HNQ32|5|Very good quality rings, should last forever.
B00RE6KV48|5|Leather looks great after applying. Gives a darker shade to the leather like any other conditioner would do, but spreads smoothly and doesn't look uneven.
B00OZAQ6B8|5|Excellent. Perfect fit!!! As good as an OEM set!!
B001G8AIMU|5|Worked fine
B008TT0DG0|5|Fitted very well.
B000Q985XO|5|As described in perfect condition. I'm happy.
B000NHUKJG|1|Mine did not work
B0019BXA6U|4|returned
B000BZI1PA|5|It fits, it works, and it's better than paying $160 at Pep Boys.
B000CB4X82|5|Shipping was fast and great part
B0007VANHC|5|Easy and quick to instsll
B00UMZAW5G|5|Worked great.
B000C9QHJM|5|Bought for 99 blazer 2 door.<br />Easier to install then the one that came with the AC Delco Fuel pump.
B00JQWA6DY|4|Worked great!
B0016C5YF2|2|Magnets are not that strong, you have to position them just right or will slip.  One of the magnets stayed stuck on the trailer tongue when I went to remove it.  I have since glued the magnets to the bottom of the poles with epoxy, we will see if that works?
B00E5P180M|4|Nice product for the money. Delivered in two days.
B000C9Y1KE|1|On a Ford E350 van.  If I could, I would give this kit a minus rating because of the very poor quality gasket.  After just one year, the POC gasket is leaking all around the edges.  Unfortunately, I tossed out the perfectly good OEM gasket when I installed this kit, and now, not only will I be buying a new gasket, but I get to go thru the messy job of swapping out the gasket.  Wix is usually good stuff, but this thing blows.  Grrrr.....
B00AO9L18M|4|Good buy
B00WJPGSD2|5|Will wait for a while before final review, but for now, what a sweet set of lights.
B007IQ539C|5|works great
B00BJLK702|5|As expected Bosch quality
B000R3WQPM|5|Perfect fit, looks great and does the job.  Keeps the JR much cooler inside.
B00KTHYDA2|4|These remotes work like a champ
B00900OHDC|5|When I go on vacation in the summer, I turn off my furnace.  When I return, I often forget to turn it back on and have no hot water in the morning.  Now I hang this tag on t5he switch when I turn off the furnace and I can't miss it when I return.
B00D3298A0|5|This is my 2nd time buying this product. I have an otterbox on my phone but I'm very prone to dropping it so when I dropped it recently and only this screen protector cracked, I was thrilled. Basically the screen protector took all of the impact from the fall. So of course, I peeled that old one off and bought a new one. They are incredibly easy to apply!! Would recommend and will buy again if needed!
B0009IQZH0|5|Great product
B00IVPAXJO|5|Love this leather shirt.  Medium weight - serves as light jacket at times.  Sizing is small, normally I take a 3XL and in this needed a 5X..<br />Clean, comfortable.  I'm ordering a few more for riding and travel.
B002J858HQ|3|As with the “New Car” scent, this Leather Scent really doesn’t last more than a day or maybe two. The fragrance is nice leathery.  If the “Chem Guys” read these posts, I hope someone get the idea to see if a longer lasting formula can be found. That would be nice!
B00AQZBTMM|5|Works perfectly, came very quickly
B000W0KTMW|5|A lot better then a bulky chain an a lock , fits jus right in the so call trunk of the bike and looks great, would buy it again if I had to
B000C7TU52|5|Fits great what a deal I got on this save I lots of money buying from her would recommend everyone to buy This for they'd car
B000E2CVI8|5|Quality product from K&N as always.  I love the nipple that they included at the tip of the filter, makes for easy installation and removal, my factory filter didn't have one and it was a pain in the arse to remove it.  But going forward my bike oil changes will take 15mins tops and half that time is waiting for all the oil to drain :D<br /><br />When it comes to oil filter and air filter, I will always buy K&N for my car and bike :)
B000C5FL16|5|Solid Mcft part, delivered rapidly and in perfect condition. Thanks!
B00M78820I|5|I received it on time. It made a huge difference in this Texas heat. With me 6 months pregnant and my employer taking away our covered parking I needed a solution and this is it.
B00HSR2PVK|5|Pens work well for small projects. My edges are well sealed.
B001Y8NF90|5|it looks and works fine thanks
B00873J0YY|5|Excellent product
B000OEDQQW|5|Best razor scraper on the planet!
B005SEKFBC|5|Royal purple is all I use in my truck. Great fluid!
B0037NSB8K|5|As expected since replacing with new Original 😉
B0013FXXGE|5|Perfect. As described. Quick delivery
B002FCGP32|3|Rides against automatic transmission if you're looking to install on a vehicle w/ automatic transmission cooling system advi
B001NZ2MCK|1|the price is perfect, but the holes where you screw the bolts for the shocks are a little bigger, so you cant use the 5/16 bolt, I have to buy 3/8 tap tool to make treads for 3/8 bolt, did not found this issue until the arm was installed,had to uninstalled these the car sat higher than normal,also the left was higher than the right more than 1.5 inches, don't buy this crap spend more on the good stuff
B008BC8G7S|5|Recomended👌🏻
B0015KH93K|5|It worked better than I had expected and was very easy to use.<br /><br />Note:  Unfortunately, some vehicle manufacturers (Chevrolet) have switched from using Schrader valves to ball valves that can't be replaced with a tool like this.  I was excited to be able to replace the low side Schrader valve with this tool, but was immediately depressed when I realized that I had to evacuate the system anyway to replace the bad ball valve on the high side.
B0002JMEFS|4|The flush worked fine.  The system being cleaned was quite dirty, and had be out of service for more than a year.
B005R3EL2I|4|Good option for indoor storage.  I wouldn't use it outside unless it was under a carport.
B00HR7U83S|3|I did not realize when I bought them but the LEDs  are BLUE!!! Really bright, which is great for safety but I feel like I am now part of law enforcement with my flashing blue lights :( built is cheap (mostly plastic, connectors came off when I plugged them in), but can't expect much more for that price. Good purchase overall if you like the color.
B010H0QV7S|5|This is one of the more well thought out car gadgets I've seen in a long while. I saw that because there's more to this than meets the eye.<br /><br />First let me state the obvious that is already mentioned in the product description:<br /><br />This is a primarily a digital tire gauge. But, as well, it comes with  flashlight, red safety light, seatbelt cutter and emergency glass breaking hammer.<br /><br />I guested that tired gauge and found the read it to be far easier to read than you're typical old school analog tire gauge where a crude measuring rod extend outward, giving you a very approximate reading on your tire pressures.<br /><br />That said, there's more: You see everybody, including myself buys things for emergency preparedness. Maybe we see some disaster happen in some region of the world and we suddenly get scared into buy emergency supplies. Then want typically happens next is that we completely forget it about for the next several years. We had many gallons of drinking water in our garage that eventually succumbed to the elements and then became useless. We totally forgot about it, until the next disaster somewhere in the world scare us into replenishing our supply.<br /><br />Out of mind. Out of sight. Leads to complacency.<br /><br />With this tire gauge, every time you check your tire pressure you are reminded that...gee whiz it's got  flashlight, red safety light, seatbelt cutter and emergency glass breaking hammer.<br /><br />So if you do have a roadside emergency, it pops into your awareness than you have something in your glove compartment that you can whip out and possible save someone's life.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I think there are some good reasons to have this.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />∞ PositiveLogic
B00ADECCAE|1|GARBAGE
B00ZYUH1GC|1|DO NOT BUY.... Spend you money on one good one than these. The brackets are crooked and the nozzle that came with will not fit on these cans. These are the ones you see videos about on YouTube as fakes and imposters. The welds are not flush they have tabs on the handles than just straight welds. I tried finding a made in China sticker, but could not.....  Going to take the loss this time, only because they will work for water, but I don't trust them for fuel.
B004P3TNDI|5|Very solid plates. I was impressed at how great the quality of material that was used.
B00SBZAG5U|5|Happy with frame !!!
B00BLPV1EM|5|Bought this for my husband, and he loves it. He rides dirtbikes and keeps this in his backpack. This version is much easier to clean that the older, smaller one too. Also, these things are tough! He crashed and actually landed on his back on the pack (he is 200+ lbs) and it wasn't damaged.
B00B00DJCU|5|Great looking sticker!
B001KRYICI|5|Fit perfectly.
B0068ERZ14|3|It is real thin and don't really work rode to Sturgis and it didn't help
B00S77H00G|2|Without the sopport. Doesnt function for my car
B00279H1VS|4|great low price, seems to be working fine.
B00JGJG8VG|5|Used this for my RV. Has worked great so far.
B005RF0MU6|5|Works well. Note, also fits the VW Tiguan.
B003YJPC2K|4|Used a handful of times when in RV parks or filling our RV. No issues yet and seems to do the job. I like that its lead free along with a lead free RV hose.
B0068EUT58|5|Just buy it and put it on the bike. Don't look at any other flared windshields. Can not recommended it enough.
B002X9NX6Y|5|Representing my love for the Kalashnikov platform
B00366GYFU|1|Poor quality. Mine lasted less than two months before it fell apart and the paint was chipped off. Not worthy of the Porsche brand.
B0065UNPS8|5|oem as stated
B00QYIFSUO|5|2nd time around! Just as good as the first
B00KVMMW5S|2|Like being wrapped in a huge quilt. Way way too big, unless you like really huge coats.
B00INBV0KM|4|First off, it was very difficult to find anything over 69&#34; at the local stores. This one is very long and makes loading and off loading my motorcycle very easy. The straps and frame are not as sturdy as previous ramps I've had but they are more than suffice for what I need. I would mind the allowed weight limit. If you do that, you won't have any problems with this product. Great price point, extra long and perfect for my job.
B00LK35H4U|5|This fit my 2015 Yukon. It was relatively easy to install, but you'll want the proper star-head driver.
B00CZ4VFOE|4|Works as advertised. Easy set up. Can't really hear the music over 70.
B00390BS7C|5|Saves time and no cuts on your knuckles !!!
B002BRN09I|4|The best stabilizer ever love it
B00H5JSX1M|5|perfect price
B000CLQP7E|5|They are very sturdy and a very well known brand. this is not the cheap stuff. Expensive packaging, fit perfectly, no noise.
B001PYHV9S|5|Worker out very well.
B00XVZYTLM|5|These bulbs work great for the replacement of the hot incandescent bulbs I was using in my Camper. The Transformer emblem I gave to my grandson
B004IARJZC|5|great product
B001RKH7FS|4|Stayed pretty cool. It was annoying shutting off and on every time we turned the car off for stops!  Plugged into hotel room, worked fine for my yogurt and Water!
B000J2JEB0|5|Perfect fit for a R50 Mini Cooper tail light / brake light. In each tail light assembly there are three bulbs stacked vertically, this is the middle one.
B00B61NOTG|4|fine
B0097CDOBY|5|Received within a couple days. Super easy to program thanks to well written instructions! Might just order another to have.
B003WRG8UO|5|best thing since heli-coils came out, except this replaced a bad heli-coil.  Would highly recommend this product, it's the best.
B003ZWCAXU|3|Ok
B0024ECBCA|4|The item worked and is in use. No idea of the longevity but one of the fittings came dented. It only cost me 5 bucks or so to replace it. Not worth the trouble to send it back. Finding the fitting though was a bit of a challenge. But I doubt that many others would have this issue.
B000C8Z97O|2|I installed this Walker muffler and along with a Walker pipe in my 2002 Impala.  At just under 4 years both are rotted through and in need replacement.  Install was easy, direct fit as expected but I don't feel this is a quality product.
B006LO4L6I|5|I've ordered this 4 times. Always great and meets expectations! Price is outstanding!
B00X35BYFY|1|The lights really suck their not bright at all n the guy still charged to ship it back they look nice I'll give him that but for that price ifound some other ones that are smaller n brighter I wouldn't recommend to buy unless your just looking for look cuz the performance sucked
B0054YQ4EI|5|Looks just like the picture.
B000RFRR22|5|Good product.Does the job.
B000CMKDSU|5|These fit perfect. Not a perfect color match to my camel interior, but I could care less. I have these liners in my truck too and they trap all the mud and snow I can throw at them.
B0007M30AI|5|Great value. This ball mount is rated to what my tow vehicle is rated: 7500#.  I saw other &#34;class III&#34; ball mounts with just 5000# rating.  I felt that my ball mount should at least equal the hitch on the vehicle that it mounts to.  Great workmanship. Bravo.
B008427D88|5|Good product.
B00G0P0ER8|5|Zero issues with my '08 Sienna.  Texas sun just melted the original.<br /><br />Unscrew antenna.<br />Get all the old rubber out (I used forceps)<br />Put dish washing detergent (very little) on inside and around the outside.<br />Slip it on.<br />Screw antenna back on.<br />Drink beer
B00L9MZGL6|1|Typical Chinese flea market product. I bought this for use on my kayak and with speakers directly in front of me it's only tolerable. I do not recommend if your wanting quality.
B001JT5OL6|5|Great for my Charger.  All agencies patrol vehicles are set up differently inside.  I have to hang mine off the passenger sun visor but it is great to be able to reach from both sides of my patrol vehicle to access the Mic and not have to worry about sitting on it if I come back to the vehicle because I was in a rush to get out during a traffic stop.
B00474N160|4|These are super cute! If you live in an area that gets very hot though, you may want to consider another product. It gets hot where I live and the glue that holds the head in place got too warm and the head popped off. It was really comical actually.
B00C80IB10|3|Not as big as I thought it would be. Works great at night! If your looking for ultra bright lights, these might not be the ones for you.
B000VKRQA6|5|Couldn't find anything to complain about with the product.  If you bought this for your 6th gen Accord, get ready for a battle.  You're going to need a really good no.2 phillips screw driver and, if any of the screws are too tight, an 8mm and/or 10mm socket.  You'll have to remove the passenger lower dashboard panel, the glove box, and two horizontal sub frame brackets.  Basically, when you've reached the filter, you'll have nearly dismantled the entire passenger side of the dashboard.<br /><br />And by the way, if you've got a 16 year old car which has never had the filters changed (or at least not recently), you might also want a vacuum nearby.  When I pulled the old filters, a bunch of...stuff...dumped out onto my recently cleaned floor.  There was plenty of stuff still in the air box, as well.  ugh.
B006WCOG5A|5|I ordered these for 2001 jeep Cherokee the stock lights were terrible. I received these lights and after installing them, I couldn't believe the difference that this made. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that wanted to upgrade there  stock headlights.
B0088P06AS|4|These are one time use only
B005XRH03K|5|Great replacement door handle for my 93 Toyota Pickup. Only been a month but no problems so far.
B00B2HHDH8|4|Look great
B000IG20RM|5|Great product!!!
B007A3T6GE|5|As expected
B000BQUEWC|2|Doesn't have the flexibility of InnoGear® Car Visor Organizer Sun Shade CD Sunglass Holder Tactical Clip Pouch Bag Card Storage. or Cocoon Innovations GRID-IT Sun Visor Organizer (CPG30BK) .<br />Doesn't have the versatility of Hopkins VSR Go Gear Visor Organizer.<br />  To use it you need both hands and full attention.  Again, this is too small for the standard truck visor.<br />Recommend getting the Hopkins which slides everything in or out of pouches and not zipper or buttons pouches.  For really holding a bunch of stuff, get the GRID-IT.
B00GU9BH3O|5|worked fine thanks
B005GLONV0|5|As advertised and fast delivery.
B0009VY718|5|Made easy work of a well used Expedition cloth interior.  Looks like new!
B004I113Q2|3|This headlight unit was not easy to install.  It came with NO instructions at all and the only YouTube video for the installation was terrible.  I had to just feel my way along.  It took 2 hours to remove the old unit and install the new one.<br />The fit was close to the old one but not exact, therefore only 3 stars.  However I would probably still order the driver's side unit when I need it.  It seems to be a good value for the price.<br />I just hope that as it ages, it doesn't yellow and get a frosted look like the old one.  I'll let you know if that happens.
B00BLZ93T2|1|couldn't get it to work for me
B00CJLM2Y0|5|Work great!
B00GSAUHB8|5|The last shade I used was a folded plastic reflective material. After 6 months, the plastic shade started to deteriorate and leave a dusty material on the dash. On the other hand, this sun shade provides more coverage, easier to store, and over all better. So far, no issues and a very satisfied buy.
B00BH0K67E|1|I had to pay two times to recive the product. Not happy at all
B005U801SI|5|EASY TO INSTALL, WORKS GREAT
B00RTJKDZC|5|Good helmet
B00029CYRG|5|Used this on a older boat seemed to work but the boat may be to far gone to expect it too look like new.  Plan on trying this on other things
B00FJDL0J8|5|Amazing! Stays on my tires and looks great!
B00IJF0UQM|4|I have a 2015 avalon. Installation took about 1 hour. Customer service was excellant. Tips.....<br />Look at the + and - labels when you hook your light harness to the cars electical harness do not use the locking tabs. Mine was opposite. Lamps install the easiest when the red washer is removed. The washer is too wide for my installation and prevented the lamp to seat.
B00168RFZ8|4|Fits well and easy to install. I was not particularly that this item requires the installation kit to be purchased also, couldn't they just include the bolts?<br /><br />Be advised your toolbox will be raised higher than if installed directly on the bed. Rearward visibility for me went from ok to awful.  I'll be getting a backup camera anyway so no big deal.
B0116DZQX0|5|they look good I like them,yes I recomended
B00DP7GW0W|5|Great product. Made in Australia.
B00DUFC8ZM|5|nice and heavy but does not stay put well
B00062ZXT0|5|If you run the oiled air filter on your truck (either gas or diesel) you will understand how this little air filter sock keeps all the bugs and grit from getting down in the deep &#34;V&#34; part of the filter and makes keeping it clean all that much easier. Plus it looks nice and comes in different colors.
B00QZWMNWU|5|5 Stars. Fast shipping. Item is exactly as described. Not as bright as the plasma or cree bulbs but also not in the same price range as those. Fits turn signal perfectly.
B00CL0ZRX2|5|This light is super bright I have mine on my jeep it does not have any water in it and it has been through 3 good rain storms the only thing is the wiring Harness was a little tricky to figure out but in the end defentaly worth the money
B00KBH642A|5|When I purchased this I just assumed that it was going to be flimsy and light gauge steel. I was wrong. It is very well built. Works great behind my 1973 Gilson tractor. Now I want to buy the whole set.
B005SUYV7A|5|Excellent
B000BGK22E|4|Works as expected!
B000EW0KHW|2|Didn't work but the book with all the codes was useful as you can wire an F150 to blink the check engine light.
B002JFEETW|1|these broke pretty much right out of the package.
B0065S6S8Y|5|Stock up on a few of these if you have a Chevrolet Trailblazer.
B003UT085U|5|This stuff works so good, I had to buy a gallon.......I'm running out. Great shine with an easy application, no streaks.
B00SSKUHAC|5|As you already know, the Tundra center console is very spacious!  I would put all my things in there and have to dig around to find what I'm looking for.  This organizer is perfect to help me stay organized!  Even after I put this organizer in, there is still plenty of room to put things on top of it.  I am very happy with this purchase!
B002HXY6F8|4|Love it***
B005909KWA|5|Worked,
B00A1A6PT4|5|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements
B009MAT40G|2|I'm not sure why some people say it doesn't sag. It's not ridged enough and despite being tucked behind the visors and as tightly in the corner as I can get it, it still falls from beneath the visors and sags. I have a brand new car so I was pretty disappointed in the product.
B002DLYR8A|5|It was good 4 con.
B00GHTRDI0|5|worked perfect
B00CB8WM2S|5|Every car needs one!
B00FY80GZC|4|Works exactly as the stock light that just went out on me.  Unfortunately there are no installation instructions and the rubber rimming is not as thick as the original.  Overall it was a GREAT option in comparison to getting a new one from the dealer.
B00UE2TI34|1|They are not the color as pictured they are a lighter grey color and I didn't want something that would get dirty hence why I ordered the dark ones.
B00FSH0WM6|5|ANOTHER EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR RV'S WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE EVERY AMP.
B004X96DLE|5|Surprisingly good for my 2003 corvette. Had a ton of chips on front bumper and this stuff helped mask. You can use the brush or the needle applicator. Careful removing the plastic cap to use the needle applicator. I stuck a knife in between to wedge it off.
B0050QIJ0W|3|Good looking and good delivery. But - very hard to install. Brackets that came with it were too heavy, too large and the wrong size. I had to improvise with some 12 gauge hurricane straps I got from Home Depot. Worked out nicely with a lot of compliments. Just sold my bike and the guy who bought it said he really like the saddle bags. They were cool not like the ole hells angels style. But that's my opinion.
B00AEVGYBY|3|Didn't really fit my car seats, but I made it work.
B006CRT72W|5|Fast delivery!! Works 60' from truck! Easy set up with instructions that were provided.
B009FU6CN0|4|Just installed them on 2003 Toyota Tundra  2wd. Truck rides better,  is taller and level compared to before.  Had KYB gas adjusts prior.  These are much better,  and better than Bilstein HD's on the other truck
B0030CC2XI|1|Unfortunately they did not.  I just got a chance to take the doors off and the mirrors do not fit. When I originally began my search I did put in 2013 Jeep Wrangler Sahara and these mirrors do not fit. What can I do to return these mirrors or even exchange them for one that will fit my Jeep? My mirrors do not look like the ones in this picture either. Was I shipped the wrong ones?
B007OXCIB0|4|Nice design moldable just not as sticky as I'd like it but hey its under 10 bucks and I've wrapped everything I can get my hands on
B00U6S88XC|5|Very good fit
B001JT5CFY|5|Great thing to have handy in the car. Good weight and handle. Hoped for a dark finish but got the lighter. Still pleased.
B000C5WCN6|5|Great replacement upstream o2,
B00CHDD61I|5|it got here, I put it in.  some instructions would have been nice, LIke how to install with out buckling.
B00064LOJ6|4|To people who want to run LEDs.....  This is a TWO terminal flasher, that means that it MUST have some minimum current flow thru it in order to work. Without that minimum current flow there just isn't enough &#34;juice&#34; flowing to power the thing. If you replace all your incandescent bulbs with LEDs there's just not enough current flow to operate this flasher.  So you have two choices... as some have noted you can only run LEDs on front (or back) and regular bulbs on the other end.  Or you can put in a resistor in parallel with the LEDs so that enough current can flow thru the resistor, and also thru the flasher, to make the flasher work.  The resistor Google says to use is a 30 watt 6 ohm in parallel with each LED.<br /><br />Another option that I *think* would also work on anything using these old fashioned flashers would be to redo your wiring and use a three terminal flasher.  That way the flasher's power does NOT have to go thru the lightbulbs and you should be able to use all LEDs without need for resistors.  It should be an easy mod for someone who knows how these work and would consist of getting a three terminal plug to replace the two terminal one and adding a ground wire for the extra terminal.  But I'm just suggesting it, I've not tried it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  My suggestion for a three terminal flasher is already available to you.  I just noticed someone makes a retrofit to do what I said above... Just search Amazon for EF32RL and you'll find a replacement flasher set up with a ground wire so it will run LEDs without mods.
B006IPTOWQ|2|didn't last long  3 months
B00GMIRCUK|4|VERY FAST SHIPPING JUST WISH THE BRACKETS CAME WITH.
B00O83N0WA|1|Did not fit my Chevy truck as advertised.<br />Exceptionally difficult to install without the guidance of a professional installer.
B00AUD5JX0|4|Coil wasn't the problem, so back to the drawing board.
B00545NJBI|4|Serves the purpose...
B008CRY8K6|5|Held up nicely with frequent use by a muddy dirty dog
B001TNBT7K|5|Easy to install. Works great.I installed on a 2002 f250 because I had just purchased a fifth wheel with a hitch weight of 2700 lbs and with the Timbrens the truck squatted 2&#34; and handled great.
B000CQOIV4|5|Great wrench, fit perfectly and had nice leverage
B00D8RYGOI|5|Very bright for that occasional off road use.
B004JAXEA0|5|Fit my 99 Trans Am perfectly.
B00E0189L2|5|Great sound, easy to install. Very good product. Take me 40 mn to install.
B00UME0UQI|5|As described
B002N5YDG2|5|I have struggled for a long time trying to get my RV refrigerator to cool better and replaced almost everything but the box. This fan made a huge improvement of 4-5 degrees after instilling it in the top vent.When it gets in the mid 90's to 100s my unit just was not doing well and I worried about food safety on trips.  My Kountry Star refrigerator has never cooled as good as past campers and I learned the poor air flow to the top was the problem.  There are several videos online showing installation but the latest fan now has the thermal switch built in the fan making one less step. For best results this fan should be installed in the top, pulling hot air out! I removed my refrigerator to improve the ducting and flow by installing some curved flashing near the roof top chimney vent. This made installing the fan simpler also since I used a screwdriver to open a gap in the roof sealant and twist in the fan from the inside and not having to remove--reinstall the roof vent. Some silicone  was used to make sure it stayed put. This could also be installed, I assume, by cutting the screen on the vent, then installing from the top but most people remove the vent, place the fan, apply proper sealant, reinstall the vent flashing and then reseal the attachment screw heads. I didn't want to risk damaging the parts on the roof or compromise the factory seal since there are other ways.The best way to verify this fan will improve your situation is to remove the cover from your top vent and place a small fan on top sucking air out and recheck it after waiting at least 12 hours. A remote temp prob or a thermometer should be placed in a cup of water on the middle rack to get the best reading. You may also unplug the thermister wire from the circuit board, or remove the thermister from the fins and let it hang to make sure your unit is cooling at max capacity. Be sure and test each change one step at a time waiting 10-12 hours between test. I would recommend using online resources tocheck other options first and get you unit working as well as possible first but this fan will help in any situation. I think a roof fan should come with every installation but We all know how things are these days. Thanks for reading,,DS
B003BZD03K|5|Perfect for our RV.
B00NLMDWRW|5|This has been a fantastic cover for my Miata.  It's made of thick material with a soft inside that rests against the car.  The cover has elastic at both ends that fits snug to both the front and rear of the car.  I have a stubby antennae so the cover fits over it with no problems.  There was another cover I was considering when I bought this one.  The other cover costs much more than this one.  I'm glad I settled for this cheaper one because it is very good quality and I'm very happy with it.
B00B80015A|1|Didn't fix
B0012TUOYU|4|We looked extra patriotic wearing these on the 4th. I have no other use for it, but nothing to complain about.
B00C2THQVS|4|Easy fit & fix... just wish the nut cover came with the package... seems cheap to not include it as well.  Otherwise, it is a great fit.
B00LBF5AYO|5|I love the decal.  Only negative is I wish it was a vinyl cling that would remove easily, but my mistake for not reading the description clearly.  But it looks great on the back of my car's window.
B00M9MRA14|5|Great product for power distribution and CANBUS compatible.
B003VWFJCS|5|LOVE these. Not hot, easy to clean and does not come off on your clothes. NO more pain from the seat belt.
B00BFOYH0E|5|Love this. I plastiDip all my other emblems took the Civic one off but I saw this on here and bought it...looks great on my 2013. The 3M tape is super strong on it as well.
B008IR051G|1|Will not work with Warn Zeon Hawse Fairlead (synthetic rope). The plastic clips on the rear are not long enough to snap in.
B00O7XYRQO|5|Excellent visibility to everyone
B00Q345A9S|5|This our second one like this and we enjoy having it over our steering wheels.  Keeps your hands cooler in summer (and warmer in winter) and gives you something to grip comfortably.  We have Toyotas and had no problems getting them on.  They are especially great on a trip as they really keep your hands from getting fatigued or achy.  They do add a lot of thickness to the wheel, so if that bothers you, I'd look for a different type of cover.  I have small hands and find that the thickness isn't an issue.  Would buy again.
B00JWG4P7C|5|Very happy with the shipping and quality of products!
B006QGD996|3|The hooks on all these standard tie downs are too small. We made them work and the price was reasonable.
B00MCX6HWI|5|Worked perfectly!  Thank you.
B0032W3KH8|5|Excellent item
B00MYHE13Y|5|We bought these for our grown children to use while on a long road trip. The reviews were mixed, but we decided to give them a try. They worked great. You can't pack them too full of stuff or they'll sag, but they performed well for the money. Be careful with the bottom strap as we had to stretch it almost to the breaking point to get it to attach, but once in place, we never had an issue with it.
B000COTE4M|2|First of all, I really like Magnaflow.<br />BUT installed on a 1995 Jetta with a VR6 (cold air intake, Euro intake and a header - stock exhaust sounded better!) At idle, it is quieter than stock Tone is a bit better at high RPM, but not at an RPM that you drive at.<br />Also, paid for stainless...seems like only the muffler and the tips are. Pipes started rust right away (not even in an area where this should be an issue)<br />Go with a different brand.
B003X8ARC2|4|This looks great on my 2015 grand cherokee overland.  Just make sure to have the plastic rivet gun from harbor freight.  Actually I realized after installation,  I didn't have to remove the plastic rivets as instruction says.  That could have saved me a lot of time and effort and avoid the use of river gun.  But anyway, the result makes everything worthwhile.
B00AMMDBQQ|5|When I first looked at the cover and felt the material, I didn't think I was going to like it.  After placing it on my steering wheel and getting a feel for it, I really like that cushiony feel. I did struggle to get it on which I expected too. I was able to place it on after 2 minutes.
B003IS3HV0|5|Extra oily compared to other products I have used but works very well.
B00FEH2DEK|3|Halos are awsome, headlight do not adjust out enough! Overall great new look to the front end of my Type R Integra!!
B00N41E63O|5|Very nice  seat covers  I really like  them
B00U0UWPAS|5|Fast shipping .. great product
B000CQFO08|4|Rear window shades didn't fit, but that's ok, really only wanted the front windows anyway.
B00E9CFUIC|5|Great sticker... very high quality, very easy to apply and sticks incredibly well
B0071HE2SQ|5|very easy to use and seem to be a very good product.
B005JP16TA|5|Using it for a gas motor coach , the generator starts up with just one prime, before took 4 attempts. Very very happy with it.
B00K9BBX06|1|My sticker was so s***ty its not even funny. I paid 9.99 for something that was NOT 10''x10''. It was actually 5\\"x4 1/2\\". And it looked like someone printed it from there house. I want my money back and was very VERY disappointed. I wouldn't buy it.
B00SO1YXY6|2|The idea is great but the fabrics are so thin and cheaply made, mine ripped with couple of grocery items.. I had to throw out in 3 days!
B00CUREA5C|5|Car washes became that much easier. This thing is massive and to my surprise actually drys the car pretty nicely. For the price you can't beat it and I will definitely buy more.
B00KKGUFO0|5|great
B00EF3XQH2|5|Works Good, need to shim to curb height.
B0031LWG5M|5|Good stuff -  1/2 price of local - ?might be OEM new-old-stock??
B00QG1NJYG|3|Is as described.  Unit bigger than vehicle.  Some what difficult to put on.  Once out of the storage back difficult to put back - like try to put the genie back in the bottle..
B001NZQB68|5|worked as good as oem parts do
B0010Z4MDK|4|Arrived as advertised (ordered 2 batteries). A little concerned at first because the packaging was not that great (flimsy cardboard box that was too small for the battery boxes), but the battery works as advertised in my ION Explorer Bluetooth Speaker.
B004LWV0GQ|5|They seem high quality, let's see how well they work, male connector seems a bit thin but let's see how it holds up with time. Nice gauge for the type of cable.
B00480FIEG|1|Not that bright. Waste of money . OEM project more light on the road than these bulbs. Trying to get my money back.
B0000AY50X|5|Awesome product! Cleans up old scratches, leaves a great finish
B00SJ7KYJ8|1|first, there are no side straps for this cushion/cover. Only front and back. This is a clear design flaw since the cover easily moves every time you get up from the seat. Still I expected the straps on the front and back to hold it more or less in place but one of back straps broke within a week. It has been used by one person taking reasonable care to get in and out of the seat.
B00OC9HMTM|2|Very bright! Yet bolts came stripped out.
B00DBERTNI|5|Great prica
B00S4HXDKA|5|Lights work GREAT. Frame/box is also very nicely made.
B0028QZP0E|5|looks good on my guitar
B000QR6XJ4|5|Great smell!
B000GZOY3S|5|Excellent
B00A3NU0VS|5|Looks great love the fitment and makes my truck stand out from the crowd. Thanks, works for me.
B00EQ26FPW|5|Love the quality and fit on my 2009 X5.
B00SS38TWC|5|This bag is great and has soanu compartments to it. It's tough and has withstood heavy rains and snow and mud. I spray it off with a hose and it's pretty dry inside. It fits perfect on my Quad (Suzuki king quad)
B004MXJGV0|5|Just what we needed to extend the arm on the awning, works great
B00OA66IAG|1|On the 1st use, the rubber tip on the end, fell off, exposing the sharp wire brad underneath. With all the foam, I didn't notice and kept going. The metal wire put deep scratches into the rim of my new 2015 Jeep SRT. VERY DISAPPOINTED! With your reputation, Chemical Guys, you should have put out a better product!<br /><br />Also, as the brush flexes and bends during use, the twisted wire holding the bristles starts to loosen and the bristles fall-out like the hair of stressed middle age man!
B000LY5LSQ|3|Requires modifications to fit, not an easy bolt on kit
B00166LS1W|1|Unit did not work right out of the box. Completely non functional. Waste of money and time.
B0002STR22|5|I was worried about the size and wasn't sure if I needed the medium or large. This one fits me just fine (5'10&#34; male ~165lbs). Does what I need and keeps my lungs happy and healthy.
B001NYNFTU|5|it good time for me ,and the air ffilter is fit for ma car.
B000E8V0RU|4|I think these shocks are pretty stellar. However, one rear shock came to me dented. (upper cover.) It did bother me (my ocd, lol) but it didn't keep the shock from working. I'd buy them again.
B00720SKDU|5|Put it on the house recycle bin and looks fabulous!  Went on easily and was at my house only a few days after ordering.  Just wish they had slipped a piece of cardboard in with the letter they mailed it in, just incase it got bent during shipping.
B00504UWO0|5|Nice decal! Great size and looks sharp on my van window.
B00K6LQ55C|5|i have a 2015 Toyota Tacoma.it's have 2 black line on the top.do i have to remove it to install the roof rack or i have to drill the hole to install the roof rack ???<br />thanks<br />ps:please respond asap
B00B4FCQCK|5|Worked fine
B006BCRNYM|5|Wow I am speechless right now, I received this item earlier then expected. Super fast delivery, it came with instructions. I just followed the easy three instructions and everything worked!!! This works perfect for my 2003 Four Door Infiniti G35!! I will continue to buy from this seller! The price does not do it justice!
B00PT18QAQ|5|I like the fact that the gauge has a large easy to read dial ... when you take the pressure the gauge retains the measurement which makes it easy to simply bleed the gauge with the side release valve. I run my tires at 32 psi, this gauge makes it a snap to get the precise pressure. The gauge is easy to hold and is made of solid material ... this gauge is built to last a long long time!
B000C9U0LS|5|Great value, arrived promptly.
B008AJKAAI|5|good product and good price
B000CPJLGM|1|Only gave it 1 star but wish I could give it zero. Spent better part of a Saturday prepping, priming and painting some headers and the paint proceeded to peel off while enduring the first baking. This product is garbage and I will never use VHT products again.<br /><br />The prep consisted of removing rust, scuffing surface, rubbing down with alcohol then priming with VHT flameproof then the VHT flat black. I noticed problems with the paint cracking as it dried. I shook the can for 5 minutes up and down and shook as I went.
B00NP85QBC|5|Love them...very good quality!
B000WG951W|5|I bought this air pump to replace my plastic air pump which quit working. I had 2 pumps of similar construction and neither lasting very long, so I decided to try one that seemed made of stronger materials. The pump is very compact, but strongly made, as it has many metal parts. The power cord is long enough to reach all wheels on my car from the 12v outlet. The unit runs very quiet, as the feet have rubber pads, which along with the added weight, keeps the unit stable on the ground during use. The air cord has a screw-on connector for attaching to the tire valve. The unit also comes with a nice carry bag to house the pump, power cord, air connector tube and other tips for filling other items such as footballs, mattresses etc.The unit pumps up car tire quickly, but since it doesn't have an automatic shutoff, watch the gauge and shutoff manually. Also don't believe the gauge, mine read about 2-3 lbs high, compared to a quality air gauge.
B010QR9H9Q|5|Good sizes, quality tabs.  Make sure to clean the gluing surface with alcohol before use.
B0139MUBXG|5|Quality product,easy application and great look!!!
B004JBQ3T8|5|American copies are just worthless.
B000WK0ZA8|1|It when dead after a week of use,
B0016GXNWE|4|They worked great.. Only issue was when tightening my cable to them you couldnt tighten very much or it stripped...
B000UH4Z8G|5|I as a retired ASE Master mechanic with over 35 yes of experience. do not agree with a lot of the other people  who have bought this. I use it for it's anti-rust property's and for that it works GREAT.
B003CSPIIQ|5|I thought I was hearing a front suspension noise and tried this. Cured! Easy to install if you do one side at a time. Well worth price. My old bushings were somewhat worn, but apparently that's enough to matter. Also, the Hotchkis sway bar that these bushings are for are great, very flat turning response.
B00C48TJ58|5|Great purchase and super fast shipping! Would buy again!
B006T8L2KY|5|Works great
B000GZGUP8|5|Good stuff.
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Just what I needed to fix the check engine light
B00A1EXCNW|5|It was a replacement for one given to me a few years ago so I knew how to put it on my new car window and I love it.  I would suggest a short explanation for easy installation for those who do not know as it is a little tricky (I think!).
B00E9DGSU0|5|appropriate for stick people haters
B00K2G5I40|2|Very flimsy and small. Didn't cover the entire windshield on the Prius, forget about it if you have a truck or suv! Gave it away and bought a more solid and larger (standard size) cover instead
B005ETVO0C|5|Fit perfectly, no leaks, good price.
B009DJN5TM|5|Excellent product, still works to this day.
B007JSGR9Y|4|I have it now. It came in on time, and in good condition.  I have not used it, so I can't say how well it works. It was a good deal. Thanks
B00W2D7S9O|5|Amazing stuff.<br />Did that just a few days ago and it looks like the bumpers are new.<br />There is enough material in the bottle for more than one car.<br />I did 2 layers on my Jeep Wrangler: bumpers, door handles, side panels and atill have about 1/3 of a bottle left.
B006WPQNB2|1|I've owned the 585 electric porta potti for years and it worked perfectly. But this year, the seal around the blade started leaking. When I asked Thetford for a new seal, they said sorry, we don't make that $5 seal anymore and your only option is to buy a new electric 550E for about $140.<br /><br />OK, my 585 was old so I bought the new 55E Curve. I used it one time on a camping trip and here is what I found out:<br /><br />1) The toilet seat is a narrow oval shape instead of a regular toilet seat like on all the other Thetford porta potties. It feels like your sitting in a shoe box or something. If you have to go #2 you have to slide forward and if you have to go #1 you have to slide backwards. God help you if you have to go #1 and #2 at the same time!<br /><br />2) The top water fill opening is such that you have to hold it level to fill it. So you have to use both hands to hold the tank level. But then how do you turn the water on and off while filling?<br /><br />3) The nob to turn to remove the batteries has no way to grip it to remove it so you have to kind of wrestle with it to get it out.<br /><br />4) Instead of having a blade valve that opens and closes to flush in the front of the toilet, it has a lever that sticks out on the side of the toilet that slides back and forth. When we were putting the toilet away for the trip home, the handle that sticks out got bumped and broke off! It was broken at the end of our first trip!<br /><br />So I've used the toilet for one trip and it's already broken. It's still under warranty, but it's so bad I think I'll just through it in the landfill.<br /><br />Now I will buy a Porta Potti model 550P. It's not electric, but the piston pump looks OK and it looks exactly like the 585 electric model the 550E Curve was suppose to replace! Why did they take a good design like the 585 and ruin it? I guess I'll never know.
B002FS9AS8|5|fit right in my brothers 06 expedition just fine.  these replaced the crummy airbags.  rides great not really a difference
B00AZOHPOK|4|Really nice work properly
B000PUG0JK|5|If you don't want the giant &#34;BMW&#34; logo facing outward, you can buy the same exact piece from OEM manufacturer Covercraft, for about the same cost, also available here on Amazon. They're identical, and they are by far the best available sunshade for your E39 5er. Well worth the relatively high cost.
B00JDHQKEQ|5|Love it!
B00029J2IU|5|Good product.
B00TI9OFKK|5|Great product and very durable. Keeps car dry and keeps dust off of car. Highly recommend
B001A0J2JO|5|I loved this . I was surprised at first when I got it because it was sooo long. I posted pictures so there's a good comparison to my Hyundai Sonata rear view mirror.  It's does a good job at viewing my blind spot on the right side.
B005X4QCAA|3|UPDATE 2017: The display has been cutting out with increasing frequency. It often turns off for several minutes at a time. Many times when it is trying to come back on it displays inaccurate numbers. Due to this problem I am changing my 3 star rating to a single star since I am obviously going to have to replace it.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST: I tried another Amazon brand that was terribly problematic so I returned it and acquired this HUD GPS instead. This model is slow to acquire signal. It will sometimes take minutes to show a readout. The accuracy of this model is better than the one I returned. However, this one also occasionally drops signal while driving at highway speeds even with totally open skies.<br /><br />One thing I like better on this one than the one I returned is that I did not have to adjust the accuracy on this model. It came set perfectly. It is decently quick to display speed changes.<br /><br />For many years I used a bluetooth, battery backup powered HUD GPS that also showed NSEW navigation. I wish they were still being manufactured. This model is a substitute that is faster to track speed changes and has a decently legible readout but in every other way it is inferior.<br /><br />I like that the alarm can be silenced and adjusted. On the model I returned the alarm could not be turned during startup and shutdown and was quite annoying.<br /><br />As mentioned by another reviewer the folding stand is poorly designed. I have this on the dash of a 2000 Ford Excursion, identical to all of the F-250 and F-350 trucks. The stand indeed has slots open on end and closed at the other so that it would face the opposite direction it needs to angle to shine onto the windshield. While filing, grinding, or cutting the closed end of the slider on the stand would enable correct posture I have found no need to install the stand. This GPS unit rides on my dash in front of my dash mounted CB and scanner with little movement without any adhesives or mounting. The angle is not perfect but is satisfactorily legible on the windshield mounted reflector. I have not installed the new reflector sheet as the one I have had on my windshield for many years still works fine.<br /><br />Overall this is the best low priced HUD GPS option I know of. I did not try an OBDII port HUD because my truck has a Cummins 12 valve and I don't use the truck's onboard computer for much of anything. I run 37&#34; tires so my I prefer reading an accurate speed on the windshield instead of having to look down and mentally calculate a 14% increase above the readout. I use gauges on the A-pillar, steering column, and a laptop to monitor EGTs, water temperature, oil pressure, turbo boost, fuel pressure, and transmission parameters. The automatic transmission uses a standalone controller. For most motorists I think the OBDII style HUD would be more beneficial.on the windshield mounted reflector.

B000BVRZ74|5|I love rain-x! It improves visibility in the rain greatly. It may take a little bit of time to buff out the streaks after you have applied it. Overall a wonderful product. Highly recommended.
B00L846T3O|5|great fit
B000CPZZQM|5|great tool and fast service!
B0002UEN1U|5|like
B003LF30HQ|4|does the job.
B000CPCBE6|4|I have a 2012 Scion XB that has always used some oil since I've owned it (I bought it new). After hitting 30k it seemed to burn anywhere from a half to a full qt between the 5000k oil change. Toyota have realized they have a problem with rings in the 3.2lt engine and have developed a test to determine if you will get your engine rebuilt and there is no mileage limit. You go to the dealer, get your oil changed and they seal the drain plug and dipstick you drive 1200 miles and if you burn a qt in that time you get new rings. I would've easily met this criteria but I had already ordered the Red Line and decided to go ahead and change my own oil and see if it made a difference. It worked too good. After 4000k it hasn't burned a drop. The only other oil I feel is equal is Amsoil which is almost half the price. You can't go wrong with either. You will hear and feel the difference
B007NU0FOQ|5|Enjoy this item very much.
B00APL7OAS|5|The hubcaps look amazing. I'm really happy with them. This is my second time getting the same ones because I scratched my old ones and lost one of them.
B00URU2ESY|5|It does it job. Hooks don't scratch
B00LL1ALMO|5|I recently bought a motorized bicycle for college. My bike can go 40mph, so I figured that I needed some serious head protection. I decided to go with this helmet because it looked functional and patriotically stylish.<br /><br />This superb helmet is of utmost quality. I will say, however, that the helmet is a very tight fit (which is a good thing), so make sure you measured your head correctly! The only gripe I have is that the chin strap likes to nestle itself atop my Adam's apple, which is midly annoying.<br /><br />All in all, this helmet is a great buy!
B009G4EKXY|5|Perfect fit, works great! Fixed my overheating problem and took 15 minutes to change.
B000GZURZW|5|I got my helmet fast and I like it.
B000BUU5YA|5|handle is nice
B00E0KGCE4|4|Good, but sadly, it's basically the same as your bog standard 48 SMD panel.  120 SMDs, but they're just really tiny ones.  In any event, just like those panels, this thing is stupid bright and well capable of serving the role of interior lighting, trunk lighting, under hood lighting...etc.
B00F596AXW|5|Easy to use and great results.
B007V2CQP2|5|Fit perfect and we are very happy with it.  Definitely keeps the vehicle cooler.
B00BGEGHIS|1|OK, first off I am a 65 year old man :) Been working on vehicles for 50 years. Getting ready to retire and wanted to upgrade my ole '99 Ford F250 Super Duty to pull a 5th wheel. Put on air bag suspension and a larger transmission cooler, then decided I needed gauges to monitor the truck with that kind of load. Order this gauge pod kit. You better spend a lot of time on youtube watching install videos before you tackle this job, cuz the instructions are garbage !! I spent a lot of time carefully installing the sending the sensors and running the wiring. But the big problem was the pod installation! You will need drills and dremel type tools to force this pod to fit your factory pillar! Once I got everything to conform, I started the wiring - My truck is a 1999 Ford Super Duty, all the sensor wires were of barely adequate length, and I ran them the shortest path possible! Problem with this ? - I could only put the gauges where the wires would reach in the pod, not the stack I wanted. Oh well, I can live with that. The next HUGE problem was the power wiring harness!!!  Nice that it is all one connected harness - But!!! the connections between gauges is about eight inches! What a nightmare!!! Far too short  !!! Barely got gauge one and two connected - trying do do these connections while holding the pod against the dash, but not enough length for the third gauge. I had to route out a large hole in the factory pillar so that I could install the last gauge and carefully, and with a lot of patients and aggravation, finally plug it in from behind!!!  Not that they had a shortage of wire - Plenty left over to make the power connections, but some damn poor engineering on fitment - three inches more between their gauge connections would have corrected the problem !! Oh, and for you who say &#34; geeze, just add some wire - these are series looped wires with gauge specific connectors. Anyway, got this hooked up, after nine hours of work, and it works OK - No way would I buy this crap again!
B00M0VMTPQ|5|Works great
B007TY69HI|5|Exactly what I needed and arrived quickly at a good price.
B00MR3SPYG|2|These pills seem to have improved my car's exhaust emissions (much less smelly), but not the mpg nor the horsepower.<br />I have a well maintained 2010 Mazda CX-7 with a 2.3L turbo 4 cylinder engine, all-wheel drive, and 30,000 miles on it. MPG is supposed to be 17 city/23 highway. My mpg is usually between 14 to 17, since I live in a congested and hilly area, where even some of the freeways are rolling hills. The only time I got 23 mpg was through a 100 mile freeway roundtrip while going 55 mph.<br />After reading testimonials and videos showing how well other CleanBoost products work, (and trying other brands of fuel system cleaners), I thought I'd give this a try. So, with a tank full of Chevron Techron Super gas  I did a 120 mile freeway roundtrip averaging 65 mph, with some short distance errand driving, and got only 17 mpg. So really, no effect.<br />As to the horsepower, also nothing. In fact, there seems to be turbo lag while merging on the freeway, where there wasn't any before.
B00I3N86HK|1|Poor quality. The metal point will deform on first use.<br />And plastic handle broke easily. Don't buy.
B00FV1MMT0|5|These vent/rain shades are just what I wanted.  They were very easy to install.  I'll have to have them in place a longer time before I can attest to their stability, but I don't anticipate any problems.
B006K8YQYW|5|Quick delivery & worked  great
B000JFJLP6|5|This is the second one of these beasts I've bought.  Love it.  Never had a problem and always works great.  Highly recommended
B00A207CYA|3|Be careful to order the right bulb type for the job. I didn't understand that H1 was the bulb type, and that I needed 9006 for my Volvo. Thus, I cannot use these bulbs. :(  Mea culpa.
B00RW7X1QE|5|After a few rainstorms wipers are holding up well.  They efficiently move water from your view at a reasonable price.  Will order again when needed.
B00DBERGFO|1|Several of led lights don't work.

B000DINKPQ|4|Great product.
B00LX2D94I|5|Great lights.. Love them
B0016680T0|5|Works great! I put Ride- On in the front tire of my new Kawasaki in 2010 and im still riding on that same tire that now has 11000 miles on it, when I replace tires I will always use Ride-On.
B005SUV77W|4|Works as advertised. Easy to adjust to different size wheels. I mounted it to a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood That I had in the back of my pick up truck. Held up my 700 pound Harley Over a 2000 mile trip on rugged roads with lots of bumps. Kept the bike perfectly vertical Along with appropriate tiedowns. Good product
B00BFU4VEU|5|Heats and cools great has worked for 1500 miles of travel, easy to install and has many nice features
B000VLD7QC|5|Love it!
B00KWDSV6A|5|Very good
B00IMIXL62|5|5 Stars, fast shipping, exactly as item described. DOES NOT COME WITH BULBS. Fits car perfectly. 5 stars.
B009FTLONE|5|We made a mistake and bought a 2015 Kia Sedona and among other issues the rear lights/brake/blinker are pitiful!<br />When your coming to a stop (brake lights on) you can barely see the signal because it is so small, day or night.<br />So we needed to brighten up the blinkers and these lights did it. Plus I put the amber colored ones which defines the blinkers from the brakes and makes the rear lights much more visible.
B00S6QERJK|1|This does not fit my bike like they say it does...
B006CCWB20|5|Good Oil. Have used it on my Boat for 10 years. Highly recommend.
B0049ELS54|5|Check engine light off!
B00EHIPQ1E|2|Well the 8k hids are nice for sure. Very bright and greatly increase your vision at night. But, Theyve been installed for about 14 hours now and the bulb on the left only works half of the time already and they should be working perfect seeing that they're brand new, right out of the package.  idk, but I need to know how to go about getting another one sent to me that works.
B009E89QAY|5|perfect fit
B0099TWPC4|4|For the price I paid, it does the job.
B00E9EOOLY|5|worked great

B00X55W5JQ|5|This spray gun for automotive urethane primer. For the low price I was a little skeptical whether it would work.But is very good. Happy with anything Amazon and the people they partner with
B0052SF0LO|2|Junk would not buy again
B000QFORK8|5|This product works very well. I have a very expensive kangaroo leather hat that I wear everyday, in all weather conditions. This leather conditioner does wonders and keeps my hat looking great and the leather supple. It is a great product and I will continue to use it.
B006AU5MW0|5|love it great product and shipping
B0006HNUEK|2|I was delayed in installing these shocks due to health reasons. When I went to install them last week, they are about an inch too short in length to fit my truck. The vehicle is a stock, one owner truck, no modifications. Tried to return, but looks like I am past the return window. Disappointing to say the least. The rears were fine, same length as stock. Just be careful if you order these from the supplier I did. Took three tries to get a pair that were not sticking out of the box or broken open. They need to be shipped in another box, not just taped together in the original package.
B000Q0LYNG|5|Identical part. Worked perfectly.
B00BR035VS|5|This kit works great . Fits well in the trunk. The kit has everything and is a nice package. And the tire kit was on my front door step in 3 days, and I used the free shipping. Way to go !!
B007X74ZTK|5|Great low cost solution to help repair Evap codes
B0073WEZU4|3|Looks great on the ruck, but has a hard time picking the HD radio stations in my area.  Siruis/XM has no issues with this.
B00MXFI5E8|5|Excellent product. Genuine GM so it fit perfectly.
B00XHG92JE|3|VERY HARD TO WIRE NEED TEST LIGHT NO WIRE DIAGRAM
B007ZT7D5E|3|Will not pick up a 35 LB anchor, I have to assist a 30 LB to get it back in the hanger. Don't bother buying the remote control option cause you have to stand two inches away from it to make it work. Also gearbox is grinding so I expect it will strip out soon. My rear winch is the same brand and has a 15 LB anchor on it and it sounds and works great. Go figure.
B00KZ53BDS|5|Easy to put up. Looks great!
B009TB4JP8|5|Great product!  I must admit I don't vacuum my car as much as I should but with this product I don't need to...... You can just sweep it up if you want! 👍
B00QRHDIPY|4|I have a 2007 Nissan Altima that drive up to my work and back for a total of 15 miles a day. Not sure if that was enough to charge the battery fully, but 1 year old battery started showing signs of weakness. I had to jumpstart it for a few times after a cold spring night. I took it to the shop to have the battery and alternator checked out and they sure all checked out. I must have had something plugged in that drained the battery.<br /><br />Then I thought of using this panel to trickle charge the battery while car is parked. It seems to have been working good so far but I may know more during fall and winter. At the worst, right now this kit definitely saved me from spending on a new battery or alternator.<br /><br />I am taking off 1 star because the kit did have anything to connect USB sockets with. I was able to work around it by attaching the crocodile clips to the terminals of USB Car Adaptor and charged my Iphone with no problems.
B000JZIW6U|5|Good price and is working well in my Explorer.
B000E0SBM0|5|Good
B0012GTVVA|5|make it easy to close the screen door and make a nice balance bar when going uo the steeps

B00QVWGNQ6|5|Great deal
B007TB4ZCW|5|Awesome
B00R2W84SO|3|I bought this tool with the intention of being able to read the Ford service codes.  For those of you who are familiar with these, they can be anything from a loose wire to a transmission problem.  From what I have read, the ford dealers get upwards of $100 to read the codes.  I didn't like the idea of spending that kind of money to be told that I only needed an oil change.<br />At first, I thought this scanner would be capable of reading the service codes, but it is not.  It seems to be able to reach beyond the &#34;check engine light&#34; codes,  and I hope to utilize those functions.  It  was able to pick up a general code for a problem with my passenger seat as it related to the seat belt, However, it was not able identify the specific PID so I din't know if it was just a loose wire or a defective module.  My only other scanning tool links to my laptop, so by far, this scanner is easier to use.  Readers who need the ABS functions may find the price okay.  I purchased the tool for a specific purpose, so it turned out not to be a good investment.<br />To the tool's credit, it did function as advertised.

B00COOS5NY|5|the build quality is great, the 6k is true to its color, and it also comes with the wire harness..great product, and company
B001U7LSAI|5|Easy to use, a little hard to pull apart at first but getting easier.  Comes with all the hardware required if you want to attach to you rig. I rest it on my tailgate, no way to install the way my camper/truck is setup it's an older camper.  Really sturdy, I have no worries with my elderly mother going up or down, or myself and I weigh around 230.

I was in a accident, went over the handlebars and am still here to share the story. The only sad part is I only got to wear it once. I totally follow the rule helmet+accident=new helmet.
B00A740VQM|3|Seems that you never have all the sizes you need. In this case working with the Axil rock crawler I have, its short several size tips. Some of them I have never seen a use for and I have been around for quite some time. (retired)

B00B2AUW32|5|Huge improvement over the stock jack that was on our travel trailer.  We had issues with the old jack with a lot of sway so shopped around for the perfect jack and found this.  I have had issues were the wires come loose and the jack stops it is the electrical fitting that just needed to be tightened a bit to avoid it from coming loose.  It is noisier than my old jack.  It is a huge improvement over the old one.
B00OO1MVKI|5|Perfect fit. You need to purchase some little aluminum self-threading &#34;nuts&#34; at the auto parts store. Shipped quickly, packed well. Thanks!
B003FX0QDA|4|Really great Penguins accessory. It was a nice addition to the man cave.
B00X7HS5LY|5|I was super excited to get these car sunshades. The Grande Jumbo II works great on my husband's Honda civic. We have also gotten ones for my hhr and jeep from x-shade. I have also tried other car shades and compared to the xshade do no justice to them. Texas heat is horrible and thankfully the x-shade sunshade protects my wheel seat belt and chair from getting super hot from the sun. it's easier to drive and move around the car without burning my back or hand with the steering wheel after it sitting in a place without cover and just the sunshade. They are easy to put up too which I've always had a trouble to do with other sunshades. They cover completely my front window as well which I've always had large spaces in between most of the sunshades before. The material is easy to clean off if needed which in west texas we get dust storms so that is needed as well.<br /><br />I recieved this product for free to test and give my 100% unbiased opinion and review of the x-shade car sunshades. Getting them for free has not changed my review of the product.
B00A2G16UU|4|These are a good budget seat. Quality isn't impressive but they still look good, are lightweight and seem to work ok. They're a bit funky smelling for the first few days, must just be the fake leather material. The install in my '94 F150 was a bit of a pain but not too bad, just required completely disassembling my original bucket seat brackets, lots of test fitting and drilling of the sliders to get them to bolt up to my stock brackets and work. After about 6 mos of use the driver seat won't sit upright completely but have been wearing fine considering they are in a lifted truck and sliding in and out of the seats requires sliding over the top of the bolster. I think these are the same seats that latemodelrestoration.com sells and they get rave reviews there but are nearly 3x the price.
B004BFW0EO|5|Great product!!! Itried everything and nothing worked. Magic sponge, clay bar etc.......this stuff really works!!!  I totally recommend it

B00RHAPS30|3|Clutch lever fit perfect and operates great. The brake lever was not even close to fit the stock perch. The descriptions states, &#34;Fits stock perch.&#34; Not worth my time or money to send back and fit with China.
B007Y87QSA|5|I liked the price being a original piece
B00HVLYZB6|1|I ordered the brushes but got the pens instead.  By the time I got around to using them, I had forgotten that I had ordered the brushes because the pens were terrible.  I used the pens before considering asking for the brushes to be sent instead.<br /><br />After using the pens, I would agree with the statement that they are terrible. The tips are too abrasive and wipe off the original coat that you put on the car.  Also, coats with the pen don't go on very even.  It is very streaky.  You also need to go to their website to get the instructions and these are incomplete for a first time user.<br /><br />FYI - Extra primer that dries on top of good paint came off with non-acetone nail polish remover for me.
B004QEF970|4|Does the job but nothing fancy. Fits tight enough that I don't worry about it falling off during driving.  Kind of a shiny surface for rubber and shows scuffs. Would rather have a matte finish but it's not a big deal.
B00W78DYVK|1|These lights are good and amazing but what really sucks about them is they only last 3 months and then they go out
B00LFM3WH0|4|Update 08.31.2015 ... upgrading to 4 stars.  I found better wiring instructions ... thanks to dynoproduct.net.  After installing the wiring, it now locks/unlocks with my rear doors.  --------  Easy installation provided by P&L found on youtube.  However,  wiring installation wasn't included in the video making installation incomplete. You might be better off getting the much cheaper PL6100 --- same as this one without the power lock.  Make sure it works for your truck.  Honestly,  the wiring instructions provided,  makes the DIY difficulty-level to complicated.
B0002U268W|5|Three step process:  This product, 3M 39010 Polish and Protector, then Blue Magic 730-6 Headlight Lens Sealer.  Worked well to restore shine and clarity to mildly hazed 14 year old plastic headlamp lenses.  Very pleased with results.
B00029WSVS|4|i wish it had a slighlty wider field of view, but since it doesnt i can see really far behind me and very clearly. but it much better than my previous nonexistent mirror in my truck, and a great price, it is a rear view mirror.<br />the night view works great, may be a little too dark, but that is the point you dont get blinded and i can see all headlights/street lights at night in my mirror, but it is darker than the night setting on my stock mirror in my other vehicle
B00EBOR3A6|5|Really happy with the fuel pump!!! It's a lot quieter than the external pump I was using for my LS1 in my 1972 C10
B008UJWRCC|5|Love them all! They make people smile when they see them. (Including me!)
B00IS94K6K|5|excellent coating, nice fit
B001H1O688|5|Perfect fit
B00IK2MNZK|1|Pice of crap ran 3 time and when I trend it off every time it pored gas out of the bole gasget and pore out of the mowth of the choke
B00FS0WGU4|5|Good quality, worked well.
B00CMJC2H6|5|My key remote broke into pieces.<br />I ordered this shell. It was so easy to put the old chip device in the new shell.<br />I am so excited .  I don't have to use my key to ooen my door or trunk !!
B00Y5FJL3S|5|This fit my 2012 Chevy Cruze perfectly. There is a spring showing however its because of the unique way you have to lift up on the handle to put it in reverse... The knob is worth it!
B003U53JYG|2|I like the product but the price has increase from $28 to $45...It became more expensive...I won't purchase again with this price...
B00YEA1ADS|5|It didn't take to long to ship and I had no problems what so ever.
B00WIOG406|1|Awful quality.
B009VPROGS|5|Now I have 2 of these caps black/red and red/black.  Love them both.  Good fit, nice weight.
B001C1ZKCY|5|Had one like this with a previous vehicle years ago and I loved it. They have become so hard to find, mostly all you now are those individual panel things that twist down to a smaller size. I tried using the panels and they just didn't do the job and wouldn't stay in place the way I needed them to even though it said it would work for my vehicle. This sunshade fits perfect top to bottom and side to side. Thank you so much!!!
B00Y1HT2ZC|5|I was told by the dealership this keyless entry including programming it would cost me 120.00. With this one I got two plus instructions for programming. Works like a charm!!! Super purchase, would give it ten stars!
B00OBEP51K|5|Great item<br />Great quality<br />Great price<br />Fast shipping
B004RCSW6G|1|Although these bulbs match the numbers and supposed size I need, they did not fit in my lights. Very disappointed.
B00BU779KQ|4|Just what I needed to use the existing xm antenna in my truck with xm roadie for a clean look. Little pricey though
B0030453CI|5|Works great!  Nice way to plug the end so you aren't dripping all over.
B00WMDHF9M|2|The wires were orientated wrong to meet factory plug. Took awhile to figure out why it didn't work properly . Other than that 5 stars! Works great, twice as bright as factory lights.
B000EDSTAG|5|The electric ignitor on my gas stove died and rather than paying some ridiculous sum to replace it I decided to go old school with this multi sparker. It's simple to use and fast. It's battery powered so you're not physically generating the spark yourself. Great for someone with little strength or dexterity in their hands.
B0096FR4KY|5|Awesome product! I needed a good ash tray that wouldn't get blown over when placed on the rail of my deck, and this product' s weight ensures this.
B0083SL82A|4|Easy to install (3 minutes), you will need tu cut the rubber that comes with them to make a 3-4mm washer, otherwise when it's tight it'll block a little the accelerator. The biggest cons? they are very small. Good quality overall.
B00UFK7TSG|4|Nice little touch to my wheels. About 4 months in and still looking good.
B00KL51AIA|5|Seems solidly constructed. All the connectors match with my 2000 Mazda Protege. Installed it and it works. At half the price of a comparable alternator at any of the local part shops, this was well worth the money.
B00008RW9U|5|I had one for 10 years and I deciced it had enough and tried one of the new Micro Fiber dusters.  It couldn't hold a candle to my old California Duster so I threw it away and ordered another California Duster.
B00RUDZLXQ|2|Does not fit vtx1300 and will damage speedometer housing.
B000CMJQNS|3|ok
B009LOO1DS|5|Perfect fit.
B0009H520C|5|Fram is good quality.
B00DIPSA8I|4|Nice sticker, looks great on my black car.  My only complaint is it came from oversees and it was sent &#34;Signature Required&#34;, I wasn't home and USPS wouldn't re-deliver so I had to pick up at the PO. They did, however send a new set, without signature required.
B00OWS4J6M|1|DO NOT BUY !!! As an long time Jeep owner, I have purchased & used EVERY top that Bestop makes. I had the Trektop NX on my 2012 & loved the added feature of the fabric sleeve & cross bar that held fabric tight & secure while the Sunrider top was open. Loved the look but not the vinyl Windows so as soon as the Pro Hybrid top came out I purchased it. Sold my NX top & installed the Pro, to my SURPRISE Bestop ELIMINATED the fabric sleeve & crossbar feature even though the door surrounds still had the pockets for the bar. There are 2 ways to fold fabric back while using the Sunrider feature BOTH OF WHICH ALLOW THE ENTIRE ROOF TO BLOW BACKWARD AND FALL INTO THE REAR SEAT !!! Called & wrote Bestop numerous times and can't even get a response as to why such an important mod was left off their PREMIUM top ??  WILL NEVER PURCHASE BESTOP PRODUCT AGAIN !!! THEY COULDNT CARE LESS ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION !!!  UPDATE -Finally a response from this miserable company after a full year of waiting !! Their SOLUTION is to send you a fabric girdle that you have to wrap around the entire too when Sunrider portion is folded over in order to keep the fabric from falling in on your rear seat passengers !! ABSURD FOR A TOP THAT COST $2000 with that chincy window washer motor.  WILL NEVER BUY A BESTOP AGAIN !! Eventually they WILL be SUED when someone I skilled in an accident caused buy that poorly designed top !!! BUYER BEWARE !!!!
B0049Z8X4C|2|this is a nice keychain, but it is the second one I purchase in less than a year. it breaks easily by the rim of the keychain. :( that's why a 2, but otherwise it is a nice product
B000CN5GTU|5|These are some excellent quality bump stops.
B001AW2ARS|5|Great I used to hold my cheer bows on my bag
B001TFE38A|5|Amazing product!  You can feel the difference!  Good protection!  Be sure to clay bar before applying!
B001DKNSE6|1|Awful. This is my second time using this product on top of a Dupli-Color automotive grade lacquer paint. The first time it seemed to never cure, stayed sticky and fell to pieces even after weeks of cure time. I figured it was a temp/humidity issue. I tried it again with a different batch in better ambient conditions and same thing. Sprayed glossy and smooth, looked fantastic and has failed to cure after almost 3 weeks. I picked up my fender and left a thumbprint in it all the way down to the base coat. It won't sand or properly polish. I don't expect a lot from a spray can, but I DO expect it to actually dry. I'm going back with an enamel clear coat and hopefully won't waste my time again.
B001GS1PMM|5|I love the windshield it directs the wind over the top of my helmet and stops the wind from buffeting my head and ears plus looks great too.
B00X70WSPK|5|Exactly what my husband had been looking for. Arrived in great shape.
B00EVY2SKG|5|WOULD BUY IT AGAIN -IGN 9/11
B003V4KCE6|4|Very nice floor mat, fits great!  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it looks nothing like the picture.  I ordered it only because others gave it a great rating, if it weren't for the other reviews, I never would have ordered it.
B004LSZAZC|5|looks great as a under-the-hood light
B001DAHM0C|5|fit perfectly
B007Y86BU4|5|The new alternator bolted rite on and works great.
B000IWFPIW|3|not wath I needed.
B008IEVQGW|5|Bought this for a 2000 V70XC.  It didn't fit as is. The smaller side bumped up against the transmission and couldn't be bolted on. Luckily I was able to reuse half of the old mount to get this one to work. Other then that the length of the product fit perfectly, and the product itself seems just as sturdy as the original.
B008FZCXC0|5|Work great for my 09 wrx good liner!
B00G0JFPVE|5|Make sure you have the correct flange. The BF11 works great on a 2014 BMW R1200RT.
B0040CYUPU|5|OEM, what can I say.  They work.
B00DUGQSDO|5|Item perfect, it's been about 2 months of use and it's still running strong, no hissing like the old one, second speed works just as its supposed to and all for a great price...highly recommended for replacement 5stars
B00JMXASIA|1|these are too long and don't fit at all. i cut them and overlapped them as others have said they did, but this doesn't seem like something that should have to be done and it's just not as perfect as I'd prefer.  Pulled em off and trashed em
B0006IX850|5|Works great!
B00LG08NQG|5|The quality of chrome on the bumper was better than the factory bumper. Would definitely use Ogden chrome again.
B00068YB88|5|I've used these mats for about 6 months in my 2005 Outback Limited. They fit perfectly and seem like they'll last for a long time. They are also very easy to clean. Hose and a tire brush once a week keep them looking new.
B00Y0AGCTE|2|Waited more than a month to receive this order, probably a back order or something. The product works, but someone on the design team needs to go back to the drawing board. The visors for the front door are fine. I only have issues with the visors for the Rear doors. The tail end of the visors has a turn about 45 degrees to follow the door. Nice, but over did it with the chrome trim on the visor as the chrome on the car does not flow down on the door, but continues on with the car. When I have the back windows slightly opened. The tail end of the window visors do not compensate for the cut off corner as anyone walking by can clearly see the rear windows are open. From what I can tell this is not truly a window visor for the 2015 model as there wasn't enough R&D put into this product.
B0024E6W02|4|Great price and fast shipping
B002ZTGX3W|5|arrived on time.works well
B007TYNTR6|5|Perfect fit. Perfect match. I am very happy with my new mirror.
B00KXNRF6Q|1|the product is awful.
B0050LU2GQ|5|I've had so many people stop and ask me where I bought these and I always tell them. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B005R6R6DG|4|Great price and fast shipping
B000C53XRK|3|Nothing really good or bad about this product. It is almost as described.<br />I bought a Monroe product but nowhere on the stabilizer, box or paper work did it say Monroe, it said Tenneco instead.<br />after some research I found out they are the parent company of Monroe. I don't like this because I want to know that the product is made by a particular company, not a random subsidiary. This is happening a lot on Amazon now.
B000IYSKAK|5|Worked perfect had to do a little bit of modifications so I would not have to undo condenser lines after that went right in no problems and no shop time to recharge A/C..
B007JW0XCC|5|I really love this key chain! I have a few male friends that have it & they clip it on their belt buckle, but I carry a purse & I have it clipped it to a loop in my purse. It really comes in handy when I run in stores real quick. I used to just throw my keys in my purse & every woman knows what happens to a set of keys that gets lost in the bottom of a big purse!!! Well now, I just snap it into the base that is hooked on the loop in my purse & keep it moving and when I'm ready to leave the store it's always in the same place which makes it VERY easy to find my keys... NO MORE FUMBLING, I just look at the loop & it's always there!
B000COSG82|5|It's been a few weeks and it's holding up well, high quality.
B00MAXPAGY|5|Worked great,Cameron wheels on my s10, 17 x 9.5,excellent!!!
B00ABYVTZA|5|This is a must have for anyone who washes their car by hand and actually cares about how well the wash turns out. The purpose of a grit guard is to allow dirt/debris from being swirled around on your paint when you are using something like a microfiber car wash mitt. To use this its very simple. Just place it in the bottom of your bucket then load your soap and water mixture, thats it. The way it works is that it simply allows all the debris to settle to the bottom of the bucket like it normally would but when you insert your mitt into the bucket you are prevent from going all the way to the bottom of the bucket catching all of the debris down there. The idea is very simple behind this product and the Grit Guard meets all expectations. Just realize that you will be losing about 4&#34; of your bucket so make sure you fill the water as close to the top as you can. Cleanup is simply removing it from the bucket, spraying it off and either placing back in the bucket once thats cleaned or hang it up to dry for the next use. If you love your car and want to keep the paint swirl free for years to come pick one of these up today.
B000HBNTX2|5|Great product to have for getting the grime off
B00LGZMEOS|5|Great product. arrived early.
B0016KHD8A|5|Works Perfect
B00J11NUUG|2|Almost a good fit, but it's a generic notch for the mirror.  Didn't even try to go around the cameras in the mount.  Also, the bottom corner radius is too large.  They must not have had a real car to measure.
B000C822PQ|5|Great product at a great price. Works perfectly!
B00W8LRM4G|1|This product worked at first but as soon as I started driving the visors would unstick. The tape wasn't good at all. I urge you to make sure your product works properly in all conditions rather than sell people a faulty product. Is it possible to send me new visors in exchange for the ones I have now? My inly request is that you make sure they actually work this time.
B005KDOAGC|1|I recently purchased a 2015 Honda and obviously as a new car the lighting is great! My only complain was the yellow output off the light and wish they could've been a little brighter<br /><br />I wanted a bulb with a higher light output and a lighter hue. Once installed I was very disappointed. Once the lights are on the lights are blue from your headlights, however that light hue is not projected on the road.<br /><br />I also installed my lights during the day so I wasn't able to do a direct comparison but I can gaurantee the lights ARE NOT brighter than the original bulbs they replaced. I'd also fare to say they're not as bilright as the lights they replaced but again I can't compare as I didn't do a comparison<br /><br />I'd return these if they weren't such a hassle to replace
B004VDVM9K|4|It fit my 2010 4 door f150
B00ZODSB2C|4|Will work on 1000cc hurricane Same years
B00LMDH5X4|5|Got it in the same week. So far so good. It's been two weeks and the stator is still fine. hope it stays that way
B006YBC0GG|5|These mats are way much better than husky or weather tech bc when you have dirt or any sort of mud from your shoe...... I just pull out the mat and shake it and boom!!!...all new; plus the material is very weather proof and the fibers on the back grabs the carpet of the floor liner which prevents the mats to move underneath you.  Price is worth it. And the mats still give that comfort look if you understand what I mean.
B00K890RBU|5|Arrived, plugged it in, and has worked just fine, no problems!
B0073MFPWG|5|Greattttttt
B005XRQ734|4|Product arrived 2 days. Boxing from Amazon was a be shady but otherwise the Depo box was very secure.<br />Tail lights were pretty easy to install even as someone who's never done the install before. Really loved how it felt like a &#34;plug and play&#34; with a car. Looks nice of my 2012 White 2.5s Altima and amazing the difference these tail lights make compared to the stock.<br /><br />I'll eventually update this review if the product last with no issues.
B002I1QC1U|3|Product itself is well made and delivery time was satisfactory. However, this did not fit  my 2011 Avalanche. Mounting studs were not aligned to the factory holes. Curve of billet did not match factory grille. Overall size was too large. Despite the description and Amazon saying that &#34;it fits your vehicle&#34; it did not. It had potential and would have looked great, but it failed for me.
B0031OXHAM|4|Worked perfectly
B0055QOKC8|4|Works as advertised but the thing is so big it's a bit of a hassle to ride around while it's connected. If you just use it for long trips it's fine but for everyday back and forth it gets annoying imho
B0085UDUL8|5|Does the job perfectly and is much smaller than stock which is a plus.
B001L5IX70|5|fit perfect  a very good grease seal
B00O7CLV1O|5|JUST WHAT I WANTED. GREAT FOR WHEEL BEARINGS AND OTHER MARINE GREASE FITTINGS. GREAT PRICE TOO.
B00RM327NG|5|Great piece. It works well.
B0009OR94M|5|Excellent
B000E1HWE2|4|Purchased this about a month ago and while it is made really well it is not quite as pictured.  The surface in the photo shows safety tread on it.  When we received the product it had no tread and was totally shiny & smooth.  I have added 3M Safe Step tread tape and it worked great and looks almost as pictured.  I have photos of before & after but am not able to upload for some reason.  If you ask I will email them to you.
B0012GTVVA|5|Love it  it will certainly save or screen door on the rpod.
B005VW86I0|5|Its good and perfect fitting
B0046IC24O|5|Very easy to program to my truck
B00G4FUW6C|5|They look excellent on my Tundra. I've received a lot of compliments on them.
B000F2MDX0|2|It fit perfect but did not come with sticky mounts.  Or anything else.
B000VNAIQ2|5|Still hanging in there! I wanted to install a tinted sun strip on my windshield and had to remove my mirror button. When I was finished I purchased this product to reattach the button to the windshield. I cleaned the windshield with good spray can, foam type window cleaner. I parked my car inside, out of direct sunlight, applied the activator as the directions said. One tip, let the felt tip applicator fill with the solution when apply to the windshield several times as you will be putting it on upside down. Then apply the glue, press and hold 60 seconds before you release. Then walk away and let it dry over night before installing your mirror. Mine has been in place for a month now with no problems.
B00939JDEI|5|Genuine subaru cabin air filter. Cheaper than the dealership even with tax. Works great. I have used a youtube video to replace my own cabin air filter after 2 years. The filter works great and has reduced odors and pollen in my car. This is a original subaru part and works very well. Do not pay your dealership money for something you can do on your own.
B00029WXHW|4|This box is perfect  size for my work needs. I like the handles to help move it around. Thumbs Up!
B007G7Z3HU|5|Easy install on 2010 Kia Soul.  Good fit (has rotor mounting beveled screw holes matched to original rotors).  Seems slightly heavier than OEM rotor; sidewall seem thicker than OEM (thinner fin height).  Replaced warped OEM rotors due to service station over-tightening followed by heavy brake use during mountain trip road driving.  Noticeable performance improvement over factory set when installed with Raybestos PGD92M pads.
B0001EVPJA|5|The Bugflector installed easily with just four screws.  It extended around the the sides a few inches more than the original on my Ford Ranger which is really nice. We were very pleased with the quality of the item and with the fast shipping.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Sticker. Goes on a window.
B00KCQSOAA|5|I purchased this seat covers and it told me it'll take about 2weeks but I got it within 3 days. This seat covers fits my 2003 wrx and makes it look great. It fits perfectly like it said and I would recommend this to anyone who looking to upgrade there inferior.
B00G23UYAU|1|They said key chain, No where near a key chain size. The valve stem caps are the only useful thing.
B00420DYOS|1|ONE- Amazon, the picture was a misrepresentation of the item received.  The one you will receive has a trademark symbol, which gives the appearance of Bevo wearing an earring.<br />TWO- I am no Physicist or Engineer, but the small adhesive surely can't hold such a heavy piece of metal.
B00A2DVYZU|5|The cover is worth the price so far. It has provided great protection for my vehicle. The material seems good enough to last for a while.
B000C16XLC|3|There was a piece broken to the wiring i had to modify it to get it to work.
B005G5SD7Q|5|Easy to install and make a world of difference riding my bike now.
B00GMWBBEY|2|Scent could be stronger. Glad to find a mint fragrance
B000CAZ5ZI|4|Here's the PCV Valve for your random 4 cylinder Honda engine.  As the comments suggest, this is not for the 6 cylinders.  Wish it came with the grommet, but it doesn't.  Be sure to buy that and some synthetic grease when you change this out.  You're probably not going to get this thing in properly without lubrication.  Other than that, there's no reason to have a mechanic replace this part.
B00AKEWN0G|5|Very surprised when the package arrived but it was exactly what was ordered and it fit perfectly.  Looked just like the OEM that it replaced.
B003V57NUQ|5|just what I was looking for.
B00F8PNJSM|5|Super fast shipping, part fit perfect. A+++
B00M1OUBES|4|Excellent so far (1 month). Bought to keep on my boat to charge phones and be available to jump battery if needed. Impressed with design and quality.<br /><br />UPDATE - ok so I have had this for 6 months AND have bought others as gifts for friends. 1 HUGE suggestion for the company - make the power ON button harder to press or redesign so that it can not turn on when in a bag or touched by something else. 8 out of 10 times I need this the battery is drained because it turned on while in my bag or trunk. I always fully charge it - the power can accidently be clicked on if the button is pressed.
B011U9HHBY|5|I got these back two weeks early than expected.put them in 50cc peace sports scooter and gained 5 mph in speed up hill.Top speed stayed the same 42mph.5 stars baby.
B00P2QONN2|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Scion xB.<br /><br />This piece broke in my Scion years ago, and I had been working around it by using something to protect my fingers (like a towel or blanket) when I pushed down on the exposed metal rod.  This replacement part is a perfect fit. So glad it's easier to lower my seats again, because I do so quite often.
B00IEYDZTC|5|perfect fit and great upgrade to an old trailer.
B00PB7VLXC|5|Works just like I needed to.
B0009V8F98|1|did not fit
B007S0KQAO|5|Excellent
B00UUBDTIO|5|Look fantastic. During installation I found that I had a bad ballast and I contacted the company right away. I got a response saying they will send a new ballast for me right away Monday morning and that was on a Saturday night.
B002ZBWKAU|5|This product has come in handy for me on several occasions!  It allows you to inflate tire without constant checking to see if the pressure is right.  It fits nicely in the trunk and is light weight enough for me to handle without issue.
B009KYYUJE|5|Just what we needed to get our hard charging three year old back on the road!
B0000AXMY8|5|Good for RV
B0012ZEZ8A|4|Great product. Just wish it came with tire gel instead of clay kit.
B001GEII1C|5|This fits perfectly, including the antenna and side mirrors. There is no need for alteration by the consumer. One person can put it on or take it off in less than a minute.
B007VRF6WM|5|Very quick delivery, and good price. The engine cradle will come in handy. My other stand is good for rotating the engine, but a little top heavy.
B00B3I2IDK|5|Turned out great, fast delivery
B00L2O85K0|4|I have a 2005 FX-35 and needed a new rear wiper.<br />Although some sources say you can use an aftermarket part, I haven't been able to find one that performs as well as the OEM part.<br />It also retains the look and fitment of the original part.<br />Some have said to use an Arco AR-14B.  It didn't work as well or last nearly as long for me.<br /><br />I change mine 1x per year due to living in Central FL with a mix of rain and heat.<br /><br />Installation is easy, requiring less than 10m.<br />Simply expose the wiper arm mounting nut by removing the wiper arm cover.<br />Remove the 10mm nut.<br />Pull off the wiper arm.<br />Replace the wiper blade and reinstall in reverse order.<br /><br />The issue I have with this and the reason for 4 stars is longevity.  Two months after installing this I started to hear scraping as it cleaned the rear window.  It was absolutely smooth before that.  I cleaned the blade but the sound persists.  It looks like the rubber compound on the blade doesn't hold up well to UV, heat and wet/dry cycles.  Having said that, it still cleans well.<br /><br />Overall - your options are limited but this works pretty well and is much cheaper than the dealer which is about $39.95.  There's not much worse then being behind an SUV with a broken rear wiper blade.  Keeps yours maintained.
B0002SA24E|5|Worked on my 2000 wrangler se.
B002MQCYO0|4|Works great.
B0036GNVNI|5|Spray it on and hose it off.  Great stuff - leaves my bike all clean and shiney.  Just be carefill and avoid black gloss painted surfaces, which will dull when contacting S100.  If this happens, apply a good wax to bring back the gloss.
B00N48DRIW|5|Excellent product. Genuine GM so it fit perfectly.
B00Q3SGAMA|3|Looks great but a few months in they ripped.

B00IA265DG|5|Fit perfectly. Arrived on time.
B00HET6L8U|5|Installed without any issues and hold the cargo carrier just like we wanted. No noticeable wind noise when the moon roof is open. Happy with the product.
B009B45P3S|5|Direct fitment worked well for 2008 nissan titan
B00BMEU9WW|4|got one of these for my 1994 Ford Ranger Seven Foot Bed. The part worked Good but the end that slips over the gas tank neck is one half to one inch short.But the part will still work.
B00CRPAHKE|5|I **LOVE** these things. They are simple and effective. ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THE HOSE IS WAY, WAY TOO SHORT. Other than that, they're great. Easy to start, easy to stop, flow is good. I have three of them - I use to move water from rain barrels to jugs to take to garden and water. I get them started and running in series and am done in no time. VERY happy with them
B000C2CAKO|3|This is NOT the right gasket, for putting right there against the thermostat on a 3 cyl Geo Metro.  This is the second time I've been fooled into buying the wrong gasket!<br /><br />This gasket is for the next joint out on the thermostat neck housing; but not for the actual thermostat location that you would remove to get at the thermostat.
B006B2VPJG|5|they fit great.......very easy install..love em.....
B00HNKYD0I|3|Not bad but the glue wasn't very strong after a few months it was only hanging by one side but still there.
B004304C0W|5|We love it on our deck and it is easy to clean and feels great to walk on.
B003VAVB18|5|Great for getting the bugs off.
B0006M56CY|2|Boy I don't know about this.
B000C53QSQ|5|These shocks are good bang for your buck
B0002JN2EU|5|I put this in my lawn mowers and run them to make sure its in the carb before winter storage. It helps a lot when spring rolls around.  This ethanol junk there putting in gas these days causes gunk build up clogging your carbs over the winter months. So just pour this in the gas tank on your last grass cut of the season and you will be ready come next spring.  Got a good friend who works at John Deere and 90% of there lawn mower problems in the spring is from this ethanol gas junking up in the fuel bowls.
B000M6Y58U|4|Worked well and installed easily. Received on time has met my need for my Polaris Quad. A bit pricey for this little sensor!
B00G05BHSI|4|Looks great.  Not particularly difficult to install.  I can't say that I find the rear clips a &#34;great&#34; solution, but darn it, they actually hold on pretty well.  I think I even lost one, but yet neither fender flare has any give at all.  So maybe they are good?  I dunno.  I still intend to get some screws in there at some point.<br /><br />And of course, you will want to fully assemble these and slap them on your car well before you've painted anything.  Even if your primer gives way to rust under the flare, you'll never know it for a considerable amount of time.  And man, black ABS plastic sure does look good.<br /><br />Honestly, I just bought these to cover up some rear fender rust repair because heck if I'm going to do bondo work.
B0087S7DM0|5|Extremely easy to use. Wish there was an easy way to refill them! It can be reused but it would take cutting the base and use as a funnel essentially. Used in my BMW X5
B00V5JT4N4|5|Good bargain. Tools worked great.
B003YJCDLS|5|Good quality, but expensive for what you get, however if you are the only game in town, you can charge whatever you want.  Despite the high cost, they are very useful and buyer beware, you get ONE PER ORDER, not two like the picture leads you to believe.
B00SG0SG7U|5|Great price, fast delivery. Product fit just as advertised
B00RXDWBWM|4|Fast shipping great price
B000CMHCC0|5|Relatively easy installation,  sturdy, looks and works great.
B000C55L5M|1|I put these on back in May.  For the first month they worked great.  They have slowly begun to deteriorate ride wise and now it is already to the point where I need to replace them.  I would expect to get more than 3 months use out of shocks.  I only drive about 1000 miles a month so I only got 3000 miles out of them.  I put these on a 2000 Chevy Suburban 3/4 ton<br /><br />Very disappointed in the product.  I am not sure how the other folks reviewed these so positively.<br /><br />Going to go with Rancho from here on out
B00F4MQJ5O|5|I installed this on my Yamaha Rhino.  Welded custom brackets and it fits perfectly.  The light is amazing.  The heat sick gets a little warm after a while.  I will definitely buy another one for my next project.
B0002Q7ZJ6|4|Perfect
B002ZTKA86|2|Nice product, construction and material, but 2009 VW Jetta sportwagen  has trouble when auto close detects it as an obstructed window and will not auto close. Would prefer &#34;a.v.s&#34; style that attaches OUTSIDE the chanell, but those are not  available for this model.
B000BPWSIG|1|1st time trying to remove it and the 2 rubber grips came off
B00SLL768E|3|rubber hose too long causing kink in house
B00L1L74LK|4|it works . had no problem with the set.
B00JI86L2Q|5|perfect fit
B001BDK4PQ|5|Perfect fit and look, this light has the same look as the OE light, It comes with bulbs and harness pigtail and plug, for a<br />total plug and play installation
B00CTLGSZO|5|Installed on a 2012 Ram 1500 Crew Cab with a 5' 7&#34; bed. Took about 45 minutes to install and works great.
B002XNILM6|4|Little smaller then what I thought , but once on , it looks great on my bike.
B000KKXP20|5|I liked the product
B00VEW34LU|5|i REALLY LIKE IT
B000XEBI9K|5|Excellent!
B00D8Y78EG|1|Quit working after pumping about 35 oz of Rubber Cleaner over several sessions.  The replacement broke at the hinge after about 4 pumps.  Between the two, I was able to make one working sprayer.
B00DZ54I7I|3|I wish there was a strap at the bottom to secure it as there is at the top. I find myself having to shift it around every time I get into my car. However, It does at least raise me off of my seat enough that my back and bottom seem to sweat less. The change, though, is not very drastic.
B002TWUTK8|2|Will never buy another Xena product after my experience with this poorly engineered alarm. I gave it two stars because it does work. The problem is that the alarm will go off even if the lock isn't engaged.Have you ever owned an alarm that is activated at all times? Neither have I, until now. If you want an alarm that will constantly go off in your saddle bags, even when the lock is not engaged then look no further. All others stay away. I decided mine would be better served taking a sledge hammer to it after it went off in my saddle bag for the thousandth time. I went at it Office Space style and it was the best part of ever owning this terrible product. I included a photo to show you what it looks like at its very best.
B00EVY2SKG|5|Very nice and very soft.  Would buy again.  I use them weekly.
B00XWZC5GW|4|Definitely better over OEM in my 2003 Evo. Throttle felt more responsive. Didn't fix the problem I bought them for however, but that's ok. On to the next....
B00480FIEG|5|Love the brightness. The color is bright white, not yellow or blue. I had SYLVANIA 9006 SilverStar Ultra High Performance installed in my Jeep and they lasted about two years. I don't drive much at night. Hopefully these lights last as long.
B00QRCQNU6|4|fits nice
B00EHIPNLC|5|Great lights! I got these for my corolla and they look and work great. Initially I had an issue that these bulbs wouldn't turn on and flicker but I realized I had to disable the drl in my corolla since I wasn't using a canbus resistor. After I disabled the drl they work perfectly fine, great color, super white and not that annoying bluish hue. Best part only took 10 min to install each side! Will update my review when they require replacement!
B00U6GC17S|1|Very low quality. Ripped pockets within 2 weeks with very little use. I haven't put very many things in it to use since we haven't gone a trip yet. Will probably be ruined before I get a chance to use them. Next time I'll spend extra money and get some good quality ones.
B00L6XPPT6|5|Wonderfully made!  Great product!
B00EK5D562|5|works good
B006GJYKWI|5|Great
B00B51Y3DS|5|Matched my cars color perfectly. Can't wait to get it installed. Perfect OEM replica at a fraction of the price!
B004GE0W7C|3|The standard chevy logo dosent fint into place
B00JHK81X2|4|Good kit, some of the stuff is a bit low quality, however. You can probably put this kit together, with better gear, for cheaper.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Does the job blocking the sun just fine but the best part is the quick, easy folding and storage.
B004A0WE8W|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B00G9Y2S0Q|5|Easy install and completly changed my driving experience. The halos are visable during the day and look very good at night. The only hard part about the install was taking apart the had light.
B00H5DOIC6|1|No matter what technique I tried, if I looked closely and directly at panels under a light I can see really fine swirls or micro marring.<br /><br />Not sure if it has to do with me using a microfiber pad, which I've never had great success with, but I won't be trying this again.<br /><br />I did end up buying Rupes UHS compound and UHS foam pads and I have never had results come close to this, simply came out perfect and there's no worries of the pad falling apart or having to constantly maintain pads between uses. Doesn't use a lot so you can work panels longer without the pads getting hot.<br /><br />I tried this product and Rupes UHS on my black s2000 and blaze orange rsx. The black s2000 really shows imperfections like no other so you might not see the marring from this meguiar's polish on non black/dark cars, but I know it's there regardless.
B00192QBWY|4|If you're towing a trailer which is more than 50% of the tow vehicle weight, you need this.  For me it was the right tool for the job, towing a 7,000 lb tandem axle cargo trailer with my yukon xl k1500.  I foolishly towed it 300 miles with a standard hitch and it was a harrowing experience to say the least.  Had this hitch on the return trip and barely knew it was back there.  No squat, no sway, and the steering axle clearly felt more planted.  With a load distributing hitch my reciever is rated for 12,000 lbs.  This one is good for 8,000 which is just a little more than what my truck is rated for, so it's perfect.  I don't want the hitch to be the weak link in the towing equation, literally.<br />For installation, I used a 1/2&#34; ratchet with 14, 19 and 28mm sockets and a 10&#34; crescent to hold the bolts.  You'll need a very big wrench to install a 2 5/16 ball with a 1.25&#34; shank.  I finally had an excuse to break out my 15&#34; crescent and giant Channellocks for that one.<br />Being the thirty-something guy I am, I still haven't acquired the wisdom and patience that makes you stop and read the directions, lay everything out and think it through ftom beginning to end before starting.  I just ripped open the box and started bolting things together.  Much to my dismay I discovered the drawbar had a 1.25&#34; hole and my 2 5/16 ball had a 1&#34; shank.  Then came the most arduous part of the process, driving around town for an hour looking gor a 1.25&#34; shank hitch ball.  Had I taken my time and inventoried the parts, I would have discovered beforehand that the kit provides a bushing which will allow you to use a 1&#34; shank in the 1.25&#34; hole.  Doh!!<br />Installation was pretty straightforward.  The hitch is highly adjustable, both with angle and height.  I ended up installing mine with the hitch shank's vertical length down (as pictured), since my cargo trailer is low to the ground and the Yukon is not.  With an RV, which tend to have the frame a bithigher off the ground, you'll probably install it with the longer vertical length up, which is how the instructions show.  It didn't come with a sway control, but has provisions for one.  I didn't need one.<br /><br />Hooking up and disconnecting this hitch only takes a minute longer than a standard hitch.  But it is HEAVY!  If you're slight of stature you may have some difficulty lugging this around.<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars if it were made in USA.  I don't usually bolt Chinese parts to my vehicles, especially critical components, but there's  no American choice here that I know of.  The welds and powdercoat look decent enough.<br /><br />Some other products which have made my truck into a darn-good tow vehicle and I recommend you check out include:  Tekonsha P3 brake controllers and Air-Lift 1000 supplemental airbags for coil springs.
B0002NIKFC|5|They look awesome. Good value. Well made.
B00HNKYD0I|1|Substandard, junk
B000N5II6U|5|absolutely bad ass
B000C7UMY0|5|It works perfect in a 1998 Isuzu Rodeo.
B0056QXV9K|5|Easy to place. Great replacement burner plates.
B00IBOKJAI|5|Take it from someone that values the power of research, these mats are affordable and look great. 3D Maxpider's well-know competitor charges $127.95 for their version (which includes a hefty $18 shipping fee). I own a 2015 Kia Soul (Plus) aka toaster on wheels and these mats fit perfectly. They are a bit shallow compared to the photo but this has not been a issue.
B006NZTZLQ|4|It works very good, but i still dont understand some of the data.
B0053GU2IG|5|The window regulator arrived quickly and was easy to install. I'm not a mechanic and haven't ever done any work on cars. I just watched a youtube video and was able to get the job done without a hitch. This was only a few weeks ago, so I can't speak to the durability of the part yet, but I have no complaints so far!
B00IM9AI94|5|Great helmet..pull down visor is a nice feature
B0040DX7EO|5|Great stock replacement mirror. This is my second one, one in my car and one in my wife’s car. This has more coverage both in width and height. Nice clean and sharp viewing. Installation is really easy. I would definitely recommend these to replace your stock rear view mirrors.
B00W3F4A9W|5|I love this shirt! Nice quality of cotton and the image is perfect!
B00HB9HSBW|5|I love this Items.  very hand and do not have to worry about people stealing it or leaving it somewhere after I remove it. Very sturdy.
B002UC4SI6|5|I had no idea it was the full door assembly.  All I needed was the door, but even after 18 years, I was able to pop the door right into the old original frame.  It fit perfectly and looks beautiful.
B00PO7BR3S|5|Looks great!
B0007VU48K|5|Great battery, fit my 2010 FLHTC perfectly, started right up right out of the box.  Make sure you tighten the posts..  Seems like they are tight, but they aren't.  Have a few turns left to go.
B001PWFPE8|5|Easy install, and works great
B00BITI7WU|4|great price fit just fine
B000Q753B8|1|so sad - I've had 3 of these counting the one I returned that was DOA. I can see why Amazon pulled this item - wish there was a comparable replacement. My 1st one was stolen, 2nd went bad after about 2 years, 3rd was Dead On Arrival as stated above. Absolutely great concept but Koolatron obviously had some major engineering & design problems.
B00063038K|5|Exactly what I wanted, and delivered in a timely manner.
B00BAZCBVK|5|work as expected
B00BZ3MSU6|5|GTG
B005CLO378|3|Worked properly
B001UCF4TY|5|It works at a fair price.
B00DSD52BI|5|Bigger then i wouldve though. love it
B008ZCE9SE|5|perfect for my VW Jetta
B001PNCLSA|5|NGK oxygen sensors are the best oxygen sensors for high quality Japanese cars.<br />Do not use any other brand if you care about your Asian car.<br />NTK oxygen sensor are exactly the same as NGK oxygen sensors.<br />Buying them on Amazon or E-Bay is the best place to get them.
B00EZJBELQ|5|Solid well built item.
B00BITR5L4|5|I have had to replace these so much on my van.  This has been the longest lasting one I have bought so far.
B003WOZOUM|4|I purchased this Car Top Carrier because I needed something that I could utilize for transporting a lot of clothing and personal items across country.  My car does not have the roof rack needed for the hard shell carriers and I saw this one could be used through the doors of your car.<br /><br />I'll start with Pros and Cons.<br /><br />Pro:<br />It did not tare on a 2,000+ mile journey from California to Pennsylvania.<br />It held an unbelievable amount of clothing and personal belongings, opening up a lot of space inside of the car.<br />It was extremely easy to clean off the bugs that will inevitably hit it and cling to it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It doesn't have any handles for easy carrying when trying to move it from on top of the car.<br />The straps that come with it do not easily explain how they are supposed to be connected<br /><br />Overall, I had to give it 4/5 simply because the handles not being available on the carrier was extremely inconvenient for trying to transfer it from the car to the hotel room I stayed at overnight.  Because it is made of only soft materials and aren't hard it can easily be cut into and your things stolen while you're sleeping if you leave it on top of the car.  It definitely did a fantastic job though and I will be holding onto this.
B002XL2IG8|5|These Camco cords are just what the Dr. ordered for hooking up your generator to an inlet box.  Cords are heavy and will take a lot of punishment, the plug ends are sealed very well and should not separate from the cable.  I use mine to connect the standby generator to the house when and if power fails.  Good product.  I even purchased a second one.
B00993C4TY|5|I bought 4 of these to go with the drum kits, they were perfect, excellent value, easy to install and a breeze to wire up !
B00DSD72RK|5|Love this decal. The Shelby Cobra is awesome . I get so many compliments on this.
B00265FXTA|5|This Osram Sylvania D1S Xenarc xenon bulb is an exact match to the original bulb for color and brightness in my 2008 BMW X3.<br />I am very happy with the performance of this bulb right out of the box. This bulb was made in Germany as stated in item description.
B00032KC30|2|These &#34;covers&#34; for the screws looked nice in the beginning but they quickly fell off so this was a waste of money
B003TTL0TE|5|Nice and soft and leaves no scratches but I do throw this mit in the washing machine after I use it.
B000E322DQ|4|Decent quality product that ended up lasting three years before it failed. It did take a little tweaking to get it to fit right but I am happy with the quality and the price of this product.
B00O9GVM5I|1|missing part for clutch cable only got levers no mounting parts or equipment for my levers.
B00E1ETLRE|5|2 years and still going.
B007JSGR9Y|4|A lot of scanner for just a little money.<br />I have some old cars and I got tired of paying $100 to have them scanned just to learn than nothing is really wrong.<br />Now I read the code and decide myself if it needs to be fixed. I can even reset the code if I want.
B00VIBI0PW|4|The Yada BT4860-50 back up camera with 5&#34; screen was easy to install and so far has worked well. I have not used it at night. I have a 08 ford F150 with a camper shell and 6' bed. The camera has no problem transmitting over the considerable distance to the dash area of the truck where the monitor is located. The picture quality is good.<br /><br />The monitor does draw power even when the camera is not transmitting. The camera only transmits when the back up lights come on. I would advise unplugging the monitor when the vehicle is not used for extended periods. I purchased a Revive dual dc power adapter with a shut off switch from Amazon that makes killing the power to the monitor easy.<br /><br />The monitor does cause interference to certain, but not all FM radio stations. Stations in the 100 to 102 band are effected but those in 95 range are not. The interference occurs all the time, not just when the camera is transmitting. I leave the camera off until I am ready to back up, easy to do with the switched power adapter.
B00GS2D2H2|5|It's really waterproof and light.
B00Y16E92O|5|Works great in my 03 trailblazer .
B006TMKX5U|5|Perfect fit!  Looks just like the original one.
B008Q9B39E|1|Badge is glued onto the hitch cover. Left in my vehicle during the summer and the badge drooped from the hitch cover. Going to try and reattach and center with a better glue/epoxy.
B00G4ATR54|4|We really like this rack after using it for a month and a half.  It solves the problem of fitting four bikes of different sizes onto a bike rack.  I give it four stars for several reasons:  First, the directions for putting it together were awful.  We have it figured out now, but why not provide very detailed help?Secondly,when removing this hitch from your car, it is very heavy.  Really, unless you are Mr. America, it is a two person job.  Thirdly, there is no locking pin.  Otherwise, a great rack and we are happy that we have it so that the whole family can ride their bikes together!!
B00AWRF498|5|Great fit. I have a smaller head so it might be too small for some. Great quality for the price.
B00D9ALL4W|5|As promised ,fast shipping. Saved tons over the HD shields and just as good
B000GUYSBQ|5|This Luggage is good quality. I have used it twice on long rides in and out of motels etc. The luggage comes with lots of straps. I have some I don't use because I use a couple of bungee cords on the D-Rings on the bottom of the luggage.
B00VS0FK4M|5|This is a very nice growler!!  I drink room temperature water, BUT I wanted to test the Maxam Growler, so I put ice cold water (no ice) inside and let it sit; OVER SIXTEEN HOURS later, the water was STILL ice cold and there was no condensation on the outside of the container the entire time. I really enjoy the NEVER-LOSE-ME screw top, unless you lose the whole top portion AND you can use the top as a cup. There have been no signs of leakage while holding the unit upside down and lying on its side. I am going to purchase additional Maxam Growlers.
B00029WRM8|4|Decent looking mirrors, they look great on my '67 Datsun 1600!! Only problem I have is the base is made of plastic but for  $9.99 I cant complain.
B002UC4TG2|5|Everything is fine.  I got what I ordered in a reasonable time at an acceptable price.
B005P004FG|5|great decal! shipping was fast and well packaged. no problems adhering the decal to my car. will purchase again!
B00KY09EWG|5|Although this part was less expensive than others it fit perfectly well and performed like the alternator in the car when it was new.  It has been in use in the car for about two weeks and continues to perform as expected with a new alternator.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B00U32D2B4|5|Very very bright!  Worth the money
B00K56K1W6|5|Not sure why I didn't get these a long time ago as they prevent my daughter from denting the other car in the garage when she opens the door.
B000NB874C|5|The best product
B002HXSA4Q|3|Ok
B008UF1T2A|5|Did a full catalytic converter delete (there is 3 on the 2003 santa fe 3.5 liter) put these in and its been 4 days now and no engine light and scan tool shows the proper volt readings for all 4 02 sensors.... They are awesome
B002Q0VMCC|5|Still holding up and not faded on my back window!
B00DYSDSAY|4|Received as indicated. Wipers are good, hopefully will last as long as the originals on the F150.
B001O77CMW|4|Rides on the rack of a 2005 Burgman 400.  fit is good but the backrest interfered with the passenger rest on the Burgman, so it was removed.  It has gone from Virginia to Fort Kent ME and followed US Rt 1 to Key West FL and returned without needing attention.  The only drawback is that the key is required each time the box is opened or closed.  Gear stayed dry and accessible.
B000VKPS2Y|5|fit like the original
B005JQNPG6|5|Added this left side sway, with one I would still get a little sway when big rigs passed by.  With this now i have zero sway.  Easy install drill 6 holes in frame and done.
B004VQM4A8|5|Wasn't sure if I just wasted my money when I  ordered it,  but after it was installed  and I took a test drive I was very impressed with the way better throttle response!<br />I was also impressed with the quality.I would definitely recommend this product.
B00N58KRXO|5|This is a wonderful item, very handy when used with the actual door handle that it operates.  Great company to contact with any questions.
B00D1SX1RM|3|Had to have it replaced 3 times before one was able to be put on the steering wheel without tearing. We even heated it to make it more pliable.
B00CBJEY82|5|very cool. gives any car a different accent
B00MU9BYS6|5|The person I order this for is every happy with them.<br />Thank you<br />Beverly
B0018YGBBE|5|Perfect fit for 1978 CJ-7.  This is the &#34;big brake&#34; 1.19 inch version found on 77-78 CJ-7s.
B000QJJ4LG|5|I ordered this muffler for my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited V8 and with Amazon prime it came in two days. I just got done installing my muffler this afternoon and let me say that it sounds great. The sound will change some once it's more broken in but from the start it has a nice throaty tone and through the acceleration it sounds really nice. Cabin noise and drone is not too bad in my experience but we I'll see as the muffler gets more mileage on it. Overall a great buy for 80bucks.  Install was fairly easy.. It was not 100% bolt on but with a hacksaw, a few new 2.5&#34; exhaust clamps from autozone and a 2.5&#34; - 18&#34; extension pipe (stock muffler is longer than Super 44) cut to fit as needed. Overall cost me $15 at autozone for additional parts. I read a lot of the jeep forums and other consumer reviews about this product. From the ease of install to the quality of sound.. All of my expectations have been exceeded for all a $80 muffler can do.
B007R6ADO8|2|Too expensive for the quality
B000QGGIBI|1|Received this tank grip today, on the left side of the tank pad there are big scratches resembling that of a keyed car. Otherwise a nice product..  I'm guessing it has to be a defect considering it was packaged and not open. I'm so disappointed though and just don't feel like going through the process of sending it back and waiting for another one.. I can send pics if requested.. Sorry, but one star for me unfortunately :\
B00KJLMLSE|4|Perfect fit. Snapped right into place
B005FJXSHS|5|My car stops on a dime and look great as well. Installed them on my 05 Accord Sedan EX V6, they fit perfectly, the kit also came with new rubber bushings and new clips.
B000TV59EC|3|Overpriced. By 5X or more.
B0002U1TX0|5|Love this stuff
B004HE554Q|5|Perfect fit includes all necessary anti-vibration shims great price for OEM product
B009PIKCVA|5|Love my liners. Safes the carpets. They for fit perfectly.
B004PXAUGC|5|Once you get these soldered in as shown on various YouTube videos on the web, these motors work very well.  Great pricing and perfect replacements for those pesky sticky dash gauges.

B0041TJRQO|5|Worked perfectly no more whine noise when i run my max AC
B00KTJ8K54|3|Great bargain

B007K6E2TM|5|Great white light!!!
B00R11TCR8|5|Lots of compliments. Tape don't stick to line-x. I screwed mine in. If they do go out, for 25 bucks I'm buying another set.
B00V4PN04I|5|great
B003BZQ6MW|5|If you have eve used a knuckle-buster rivet gun for hours, you will love this. Solid tool, never a misfire. although there were NO instructions, and it looks like this was previously opened, I figured it out.  Another reviewer suggested removing the base, etc. It's not necessary. There are 3 places to add oil, If you put a few drops in those and work the lever, that should shake out any lock in the doo-hickey. Don't take it apart, it's a brute mess, and completely un-needed unless you want to tinker.
B000GZM58O|5|Best highway bars out there! Love them!!
B00FQ0RG4C|1|This does not fit the 97 nissan maxima. The elec. Plug (molex connection) does not fit and the vac tube connections are too small.
B000C31J4G|1|Fine product, not the right part for my classic CJ though (F134 motor) - Autozone thought it was too...
B0083G3AXC|5|Fit our zero-gravity reclining lawn chairs perfectly. And the things we wanted to hold fit nicely on the tray: cell phone, bag o chips, beer, mug, etc.
B0006ZXU2Y|5|Arrived promptly. Like it.
B005JPNWXS|5|purchased as gift for a Zombie fan, he loved it
B009GOVCS0|5|Everything was perfect except these did not fit my model. Very easy return. Thanks
B001GJ3FEC|5|Works really good
B0017N6KSK|5|Works great when I remember to use it.
B000VSJKR0|5|Not as good as the Weather Tech mats we have in the other car--those are really exceptional--but these are still a tremendous value. Fit well, cover and protect the interior. Because of drought this Summer, I haven't had much experience with wet-weather conditions, but I am sure they'll be fine.
B00J5CVMLU|5|Great product and does not harm my black cars finish at all.  I park my car outside at work, and sometimes I need to use it each time a bug or bird droppings appear on the surface.  A little goes a long way, and even using it on the entire car, makes it shine like my car was just detailed.  Amazing product.
B0009IQZFM|5|For many years I used a chamois to dry my car after washing it. Then for a while I tried the microfiber clothes. I prefer this to both. It soaks up a lot of water and it is so soft. I always rinse it after each use and hang it on a towel rack I installed in my garage. I have just ordered a second one with the idea of going over the entire car with the first one and then following up with a fresh dry towel.
B00XULP8XA|5|Everything good!!!
B0068B2AXK|3|didn't notice much different from stock. Just okay.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Good quality organizer!

B000QIH3C4|5|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements
B00EJUBRQI|5|came with 10, only needed 6 to replace all the ones in my truck...every one worked perfectly and are brilliant white in color.  No more yellow dull glow.  great great upgrade to any vehicle at an awesome price and super fast delivery + I have 4 left if one should decide to go bad 10 years from now
B00ID94XCG|5|They fit perfectly and with the right prep/cleaning they stay well put.  Look great too!
B00NG89B3U|5|Matched our Honda Odyssey perfect.  I backed into a concrete pole and after replacing the reflector, buffing the fender and then applying this you would not even know.
B000765E08|5|Install was super easy. Well made and perfectly level after the bolts were tightened. Also, They send multiple bolt sets in the kit to ensure they fit any variations in the Jeep production. Outstanding!!
B001KQAAFS|5|Item fit perfectly easy to install
B008D6UXYQ|5|Love my stickers so much!  They came a week early too. Really good product
B00YVHGTBM|5|If you want to make some mods to your car, forget Vag Com it is old, out dated and will allow you to change some parameters that you should not be changing. These guys are Carista are doing it right, keep up the awesome work and the updates. Thanks
B000COCUF2|5|Good product.
B002LNI8GW|5|gets the job done in a jiffy.
B00INBV0KM|5|Better than advertised. Quality construction. Would recommend to anyone.
B004OD3HCM|5|Good product
B00NXRXAS6|2|The product it's self feels and looks great. However They did not fit on my 2010 Kia Forte. The problem was getting it to slide onto the J-hook, now before people say you didn't know how to install them I tried several times with very hard force they would not slide in . So I took one of the blades and went over to my Dodge neon and even though there the wrong length I slid  them on to the J-hook no problem at all. Then back to my Kia and again would not slide on at all. So I ended up  having to go to Wal-Mart and get  Bosch Icon at a higher cost and they went on no problem as well.<br /><br />I well say these are going back, however they feel better made than the Icons. I wish they would have worked and saved me some cash. Maybe I got a defective one don't know. So I can't really give them a good score or a bad score. Just wished they fit. Amazon has them listed as the fit. They don't
B008N6BSWM|5|great quality looks good
B005636AEG|2|Had this for over 2 years. Strap ripped from the cushion.
B004GD9AA8|5|Fit and works perfect. Easy to install.
B00KD666IG|5|Gotta be honest guys, they accidentally gave me the wrong tracking number. I say &#34;accidentally&#34; because my Amazon account said my product was &#34;in transit&#34; while my fed ex tracking said &#34;delivered.&#34; They rectified the situation immediately with apologizes. Just want to say thanks to their amazing customer service reps for being patient with a customer like me. I don't usually spend this type of money, but when I do. It has to be the best. And let me tell you. THAT IT IS!!! Saves you a heap of time. Fits perfectly in my husbands Subaru wrx. It can look masculine, so if you're looking for a more feminine touch, I suggest you accessorize the inside of your vehicle because these babies scream HEAVY DUTY and WORK! Which I don't mind. Makes a man about his car, and a car about the man ;) anyway, here's some photos. If you wear boots everyday like my husband, and you track in dirt to no end, these mats are for YOU! They don't cover the very top edge of the seat, which is fine. Nothing or no one ever steps or bothers with the edge. If husky comes out with a protector for that anyway, I'll be sure to buy it here from this seller. It's worth it.
B000Z0HVHA|5|A good product, at a fair price.
B000OV5IQQ|5|Great motorcycle cover.  Keeps the bike totally dry even in heavy rain.  The heat resistant bottom half is the best feature.  If you've ever gotten home from a ride just as it starts to rain you know how important it is to have a cover you can put on a hot engine.  Great cover!
B003V57NUQ|4|I did not give this product 5 stars solely for the straps. I purchased two sets of these for my SUV, one for a 10ft sit on top kayak, and the other for a 9ft 10 inch sit in kayak.The racks fit both of them comfortably on the top of my car. However, the straps won't hold well at all. The latch easily comes undone, but we were able to travel under 50mph and tie them off enough to be stable. We will be purchasing ratchet straps to use with the racks for longer trips.
B00AW020QU|5|Fits perfectly!!
B005SUVQUK|5|worked great
B00QQUB75K|5|Perfect!!! Easy to put on and looks great.
B001NI7KE2|5|just what i needed
B0007OWD2M|5|Best glass cleaner I've ever used!
B002V0AMX2|3|I assumed this product would come in some color scheme, not.
B003BN3R62|5|Love it ,have one on each car.
B000CLLIJY|5|The kit had everything I needed in it. It is a very complete kit
B00P9EJGR0|5|Received on time. Very happy with purchase.
B00CQLNLV6|4|Appearance is good. But can say about the performance only after installing the same in the car...
B000CIK9L0|5|I love this muffler! It flows great and sounds really nice. I have had this installed on my supercharged ion redline for almost 5 years and it still looks great no signs of rust or corrosion whatsoever. The best thing about the turbo xl is the sound. It has a nice deep note, not raspy sat all. It's fairly quiet when cruising at partial throttle, no drone just a pleasant purr. At WOT it really comes alive! Not too loud or obnoxious just a nice deep low growl. When I lift off the throttle it has a nice &#34;blub blub blub&#34; that's always pleasing to her haha.<br />I had a magnaflow muffler before and it sounded bad, way too loud and raspy and an obnoxious high pitch note that would draw attention.<br /> Borla is hands down the best mufflers available. I would recommend them to anyone who wants the best possible performance and a really sweet exhaust note. You will not be disappointed.
B000GZPOFU|5|Excellent
B00TUNSV2W|3|Not bad...does a decent job at cleaning. I do like the citrus scent, and it seems to dry and leave no residue.
B005SAJHNS|4|The picture is really good, but seeing the plate in person really very nice plate!
B007HRL526|5|Love it
B000GU05NQ|5|Excellent
B00TF7BVWK|5|It helped organize the emergency kit I made for my husband car.
B00CB4YHO8|5|Great price and built well.
B00DWUOYRK|5|Sweet
B003CKQKLS|5|Excellent
B000ET525K|5|Substantial product; will do the job!
B00267PZUK|5|Worked great
B00KQXKG46|3|I received my Bar and it is really really bright but I received the wrong one because the one I got is only flood LED light and not a combination and the seller has not replied back to me whether or not I need to return it to get the new one or not if you have any helpful advice please comment
B00DSMH078|5|Very easy to use in our car and truck.  Really made a difference in the acceleration in both vehicles!
B00MQ33GIM|5|Loved it.  It is the perfect size for my use yet small enough to keep in a motorcycle Saddle Bag.<br /><br />FAB
B00MUF4Q6M|5|simple, sturdy keychain.
B0025UGOVW|5|For 50% more than the single use chainsaw bar greasers, you get one that can be refilled and should last many years for many small greasing jobs.
B003VGL2UW|5|I saved tons of money!!!
B0088V424S|1|Don't buy black decals for dark tinted windows.  Lesson learned, also it is so small it didn't really look like a dragon.  Everyone thought it was some kind of bird.
B001P2ETL8|5|Works perfectly.
B007ZVR44W|4|Product quality is good. Sticky tape.
B00NGFP5S8|5|Perfect replacement for damaged one.
B00943V7S8|5|Very happy with it. Looks great, fits perfectly and is genuine GM.
B002MQDY4O|5|Easy to install
B00VNBDWPK|5|Finally a LED light that doesn't blink. I almost gave up on installing LED lights in my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee and I'm glad I tried the OPT7's.  My factory fog lights were very orange and weren't that bright and I really wanted a pure white light and that's exactly what these provided! They are more expensive than most of the other LED lights but out of the 5 others that I've tested, these are the only ones that didn't blink.  I even tried resistors on the old lights but nothing fixed the issues I was having until I bought these.
B0016I8EBC|4|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements
B000E4NRFC|5|I installed this puppy in 8 minutes. That is counting the time from when I arrived that the car, unlocked it, opened the box, installed the light and tested it. Super easy installation. I highly recommend it
B00AFV7DI6|5|These have fit perfectly on my 2011 Ram 1500 Crew cab 4x4. People ask if they are factory. No, they are not but sure look like it. You still get use of your puddle lights, and blinkers on the mirrors. The bottom clip blocks the blinker a little bit, but it is still visible. The small tow mirrors work great and are easily adjustable. They seem to stay adjusted and I have not had any issues with them changing angle or anything. Highly recommend if they fit your rig!
B002YKMCDW|5|I prefer this over the wire and the quarter looking tool for some reason. Worthy of checking out.
B00EKTBXR6|5|Just need to push a bit strong and turn and...click.
B000EDQR50|4|These catches aren't the same size as the originals on my 2014 Puma, which are screwed into the trailer with a single screw. If I use the same hole to screw these in then the catch doesn't match up with the clip on the door. I either have to fill the original hole in to avoid water entry and drill a new hole almost right beside it or use the adhesive backing and press it on. I doubt the adhesive would hold this wide storage door up. I deducted the star for this reason, and the fact that Camco describe these as an exact replacement for the ones that come on your RV or Travel Trailer. Other than that they work okay.
B00VTSZU9S|5|Perfect fit, fast ship highly reccomend
B00F5LMTVC|5|Keeps the Wave 3 Catalytic heater clean between uses which will extend the heater's life. Comes off and goes back on very easily.
B00EEKQ4DE|5|Perfect fit. Worked great in a replacement plastic tank I bought for a ATC250R.
B000O060QO|4|Perfect even though it's a made in China part. To Ford specifications no doubt. Much better quality than Dorman seals. Delivery took a little longer than expected.
B00PV37ZEA|3|so much smaller in persom
B00B7FC4DI|5|This stuff really works.
B002M9LBIC|4|This is the best tire cleaner for people who want to get their tires clean but are not an auto detailer and don't wanna pay one every week when they wash their car - like me! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because you've gotta crank the nozzle manually and to cover all 4 whole tires and rims gives me hand cramps - it would be amazing if Armorall made this in an aerosol spray or something, for us ladies that don't have such big biceps :) Also, this bottle only lasted for 2 1/2 washes.  There was still product in it, but the spray wasn't picking it up and it wasn't worth the cramps to squeeze out the rest of it.
B00MAUT7H0|5|Perfect fit!
B0094XHG8I|5|Fair price and fast delivery, can't beat that!
B001PBJGF8|5|great!
B00WS7DAFK|5|I mounted this in a Ford Ranger. For the most part it was easy to install, though the center bolt was a little difficult to tighten down. Had to buy a new wrench.<br />I got this to haul two fat tire ebikes (4.9&#34;).<br />Works great, easy to install, great construction, excellent price, great shipping.<br />As far as motorcycle use, I have no opinion.
B00R2LLZ4U|5|This thing has helped diagnose more cars and clear more codes then my father's big handheld unit.<br /><br />It's easier to use. That's why. No cables. Quick connection to my iPhone 6 and my Galaxy S5. Connects to every car even our picky VW cars.<br /><br />The quality is DEFINITELY above the other units I've had. This is Bluetooth 4.0 and you can definitely see the difference in performance. When other units lag regarding data such as rpm, throttle position and anything real-time.... This unit is spot on fast and accurate.<br /><br />Have recommended this specific unit dozens of times. The only one I'll buy.
B00AB2PBU6|5|Very happy with these car seat covers...good price and they look great!  Would buy again.
B0002CSQ7A|5|Fast shipping. Snapped into place on Daylighters.  More convenient than the standard yellow Daylighter covers.
B00ML7IELC|3|3 hrs. After installing these. One side went out and will not work anymore.
B00RVSVPQM|5|I bought this for my husband's car and he loves it.  It was very easy to put on and looks great!
B002KCWWFC|5|It work as advertised.
B00U7CSALC|5|Teen daughters first hammock. Needs longer ropes or straps but hammock is just fine.
B004RNR9BY|5|The hose works fine.
B00HXCAFJ4|5|Used this to connect the chain on a Triumph Tiger 955i.  No issues so far.
B00MTHPAN4|5|Really like the product
B00SJTQTDQ|5|Very fast shipping, absolutely perfect thank you
B007QBSHNI|4|Would've been 5 stars had it not been made in China. Other than that has been working great
B010CA65P6|5|Fits great, looks great.
B00GBQYFVC|3|I had the same issue and had to return this item. Upon investigation i founded out that this one is mounted with Plastic ring and VAG # 1J0919087H. The one I have on the car mounted with metal ring, had an extra lip on the top and bigger in diameter and VAG # 1J0919051Q. They do need to catalog it better. It was frustrating to take everything apart and realized that new part wouldn't fit.<br />Seems like VW did put different pumps on the same year/model of cars, so it is not the matter of Jetta/Golf/Beetle but what actually installed in your car.<br /><br />As far as part itself it appeared to be dissent quality
B007NJDCXS|5|Makes my 2014 Evo look ten times better. Fits awesome. Works great.
B003WDDLTO|5|Awesome!
B00E63THQA|5|Same level as sex #realtalk
B00JGE2PUE|5|Great product
B00SQ2GEJA|1|Worked fine when installed an I tested it in my driveway. Then it quit cooling halfway through 3000 mile road trip.
B001BNASI4|5|These mats are heavy duty and fit in my truck great. One reviewer wrote a while back that his came with a B and not the Ravens logo and I was not going to order these. I would have sent back but these came as pictured. I could not be happier with these. They grip the carpet to stay in place and look easy to clean with a hose. I would highly recommend.
B001BN76IE|5|These Coil packs straightened out my sputtering 5.4 3V Triton Motor.  If your Looking to buy these for yours, make sure your coil packs on your 5.4 3V have the short boot that don't have a bend.
B00IRWLXRM|5|This kit fit my 2001 GasGas EC 300. Every last possible gasket and O-Ring is there. Exhaust O-Rings, exhaust flange gaskets! This is a thoroughly complete kit. It seems to have head gaskets for the 250 and maybe even the 125 as well, but can't verify since I used it on the 300. I hope Athena is still making these and that Amazon gets more in stock.
B009CAVTTK|2|Cheapo product.
B007XZK1QI|5|Nice, quality product for the camaro.
B008FCCYWC|5|Good thick, sturdy mat, fits perfectly in the bed of my 2015 Silverado.  So helpful keeping things from sliding around.
B00DE22CIE|2|You pretty much payed for the shipping not the sticker and it does not look the same in the picture
B008G26ZGW|5|My car looks  like a new vehicle. Perfect fit easy to install great price
B00JIIZCM6|5|Leather cleaner works great so far on everything I applied it to!
B00G4EXCAQ|5|Got this for my husband and he loved it!!!  Would recommend this highly to any Veteran.  The decal is the perfect size to display on the back window of his truck and it does not block the view in the rear view mirror as it is transparent on the inside!  Arrived promptly and I will be purchasing again for this company......MILITARY BEST!!  The website name says it all.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Using it to power my camper lights. works vary well, I keep it charged with a solar charger.
B00O9SPKCW|5|i ordered these this week and got them fast in the same week. i installed them in ten minutes and they are very bright and look good on my 2011 camaro rs. i do not know how long they last, but however, they are awsome as up to now. you just plug and play. To install i just jacked my car up anough to get under the fender wall and unpluged my old bulbs. Then i installed the jdm astar led bulbs and it worked. You do not have to go through all that trouble removing the three screws on each fender wall cover to get to the bulbs to remove them. I thought i would share this with those who are looking to install these in their camaro 2010 and up. i will also order me another pair for back up, and the price for these is great. These babies are just as bright or even brighter than my holo projector head lamp By the way they even have projector made with them which make them that much brighter.
B0002Q80GS|5|Arrived on time and performs as advertised. easy to install
B000FW7V50|5|Works great! Added this to gas tank after changing oil amd putting a full tank of gas in. Increased MPG by exactly 1mpg on the dummy screen and dismt change any driving patterns.
B008VQ666W|1|It fits fine, but it was delivered with some kind of white smudges on it, like it was a bad logo or something.
B0024ECD2I|4|This worked great and is a lot easier than pulling the plug out each time.
