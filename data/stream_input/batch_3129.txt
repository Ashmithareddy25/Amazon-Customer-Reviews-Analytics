030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a brilliant author who takes the liberty to express what can lie underneath a not-so-perfect marriage. Amy is a loving, caring, and thoughtful wife. At least that’s what her husband thinks of her. But to Amy, Nick is an abusive, hotheaded husband. Gillian takes you inside a killer, psychopath, but intelligent mind to expose the truth about Amy. On the day Amy disappeared, the cops instantly suspected Nick, her husband. But did Nick really do it or is he being framed? What really happened on this happy couples 5th anniversary and where is Amy?  Gillian Flynn answers these questions along with many others about the disappearance of Amy Dunne. In the beginning of the investigation, on the scene, the investigators found a tiny box that led to Nicks first clue for his 5th anniversary gift that Amy put together before her disappearance. These clues expresses Amy’s love for Nick and the things she liked about him most. Also, Secrets and betrayals are revealed. This book allows the reader to contemplate who the antagonist is and decide for him or herself. Gillian Flynn’s story is about a deceitful couple that always thought they were meant for each other. Gillian allows you to go with Nick on the hunt for his wife. I would recommend this book for anyone to read. No matter girl or boy, this book is a great choice to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an amazing read, a real roller coaster.  Typically I can figure out the &#34;whodunits&#34; after a couple of chapters, or at least have a good theory going.  This book totally snowballed me.  I had no theories, no ideas at all about who did what when.  Gillian Flynn works some serious plot magic, leaves you guessing and hanging and then pulls a twist so clever you will be left speechless.<br /><br />The only disappointment for me was the ending.  Don't get me wrong, the ending was what the characters deserved, but it left me feeling sorry for too many of the second tier characters, none of their stories ended as justly.  I wish I could say more about that, but I don't want to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this book by giving anything away.<br /><br />Seriously, don't read this book if you have other things going on.  My life was suspended for several days while I devoured this story whole.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Amazing story!  I highly recommend it. Was glad to share this story with my family.  Very inspirational and solid moral messages.

B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I was so anxious to read this book, especially after reading &#34;<br />the Last Anniversary&#34; by this author.  I was so disappointed.  It just dragged on, not holding my interest at all.  It was like &#34;a boring day in the life of anyone.&#34;  I was also able to imagine how it would end about a quarter of the way through the book.

B00ECR7KX2|5.0|One of my favorite Shakespeare pieces of work accompanied along with my favorite Director of all time. I loved the performances and found much amusement at the touches Joss added to this timeless classic. From a true and tried fan...thank you Joss Whedon for being the master you are.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|This was assigned for a book club and I just couldn't finish it. There just isn't really enough action and the two voices used in the story give a unique dual perspective, but then you just read the same story twice.

B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|I am rather remiss to judge any artist by their age, but ultimately it's difficult to ignore the fact that this album was written by a 17-year old.  The music and her voice are rather pleasant to listen to; if you like the first single &#34;Royals&#34; for the artistry you will not be disappointed by the album.  A lot of the songs are similar, however<br /><br />The songwriting is good, but the subject matter is really what makes this 4 instead of 5 stars for me.  Personally, I find music the most appealing when its universal, when the lyrics could represent anyone's experiences.  But this album feels like a sophisticated teenager's experiences.  For example, from Tennis Course:  &#34;Don't you think that it's boring how people talk/Making smart with the words again/Well I'm bored...And I am only as young as the minute is...&#34;  Maybe I'm missing something, but it's hard to relate to.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I think that the book was kind of confusing. Besides that I think that the book was a really good one. You never knew what was going to happen next. It also had some suspense to it as well.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A friend of mine let me know that this was available for free downloading through Amazon. I went to the site and downloaded to my Droid. I like how it works much better then the one that comes through Google.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I just could not put it down. I was captured by the intensity of family, friendship and love.  It was filled with heartbreak and heart-strength. A truth about those who have caused human suffering , their despicable cold-hearted greed, and those who rose above.  Everyone should read this!!  All age groups
B00447G29S|5.0|excellent !!!!!!!!!!!! awesome visual,great for the family, a perfect holiday movie. the kids watch it over and over and the 3d is amazing
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This product is above and beyond what you would expect.  It is a far greater quality than its successors as well.  I think the X42 is a cost cutting measure for more profit because it's a much cheaper feel than this one.  Ampify Perk on Ghosts and SitRep Pro on MW3, works great
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora is Epic Fantasy without all the Epic.<br /><br />Since Scott Lynch's third book in the Gentleman Bastards series, Republic of Thieves, just came out to great fanfare. I decided to check this series out.<br /><br />It's no secret that I find the bane of Epic fantasy all the tedious description and navel gazing about the world. I understand the point is to immerse the reader, but far too often I find it to be nothing but voyeurism into the mental masturbations of the author. Worse yet, all that nonsense rarely adds anything to the story itself. No guidance for the characters. No direction for the plot. Mind you, I'm not a scene-sequel junkie that requires nothing but action thrusting the story forward. I find these stories just as tedious because all you get is the next &#34;raising of the stakes&#34; and no plot intricacy and slim character development.<br /><br />I want balance!<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora delivers. The cast of characters is fairly small for such a long fantasy tale, but because the story is presented in two threads, one in the past and one in the present, you get two for the price of one on many of the characters. You also get to see how the characters develop into who they are. Scott Lynch does a marvelous job switching back and forth between relevant interludes from the past and back into the present. This can be hard to pull off. All too often, flashbacks are either thrust into a story ham-fisted and seem clunky, or they have no relevance to the current plot and are simple character info-dumps. If you hate flashbacks, you need not fear them in this story, the past and present are woven together very elegantly.<br /><br />The point of view is principally from Locke's vantage, but 5-10% of the time it does switch to other characters. This doesn't bother me. I don't need to have everything from one PoV, or balance amongst the other eyeballs we see through. However, without getting into any solid spoilers, there was one major plot point where one of the main character dies that would have been nice to see, but we only get to see the aftermath from Locke's perspective. This is just a detail. Far be it from me to tell Scott Lynch how to present a story. For all I know, such a scene was in there, but was edited out to prevent redundancy.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting because it is not what one expects from the initial promises. The Gentlemen Bastards are grifters, and the story begins with the group running a long con on one of the nobleman. Though, about 30% of the way in, a new plot wave sweeps in and takes the characters for different a ride. From a meta point of view, this is unusual precisely because it creates a number of promises to the reader that go, not so much unfulfilled, as meaningless to the true story. I suspect many that don't like this book don't like it for just this reason.<br /><br />For my part, I thought it a brilliant writing device. Basically, all that meaningless Epic exposition I find so tedious, was written as a meaningful story that is swallowed alive by a greater story. That said, I could see such a technique getting over used and not done half as well. So my hat goes off to Scott Lynch for writing such a seamless transition of one story morphing into another (while writing the seamless transition from past back into present!).<br /><br />This story is well known for being a bloody tale, so be warned there is a lot of violence, though I would not describe it as &#34;graphic&#34; in its gratuity. The created world, Camorr, is a violent place. The characters are simply a product of such a world. I would classify it as '80's rated R. Today, a director would probably let the most bloody of actions happen just off screen and be happy with the PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Overall, I was really impressed with this story. As a reader, it's the porridge that's neither too hot, nor too cold, and turns out to be just right. It is a marvelous example of breaking many rules of the trade in just the right way to make a compelling story.reaking many rules of the trade in just the right way to make a compelling story.

B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I was so taken aback by the reviewer that said that the tutorial didn't accurately explain how to solve these that I went back to run through it again. The tutorial does adequately explain the premise of this game. Sorry, but I don't think that reviewer and friend is understanding the explanation. As a mathematics and chemistry teacher, I see this app as a great way to exercise logical thinking. So far, I'm finding this to be tons of fun! Maybe I'll assign  as homework tonight.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The thing I liked most about the book is that there were many things going in that tied together towards the end of the book. A great read for sure, I will be reading more of David's books
0385523394|4.0|Very interesting story without the soapiness of the Netflix series.  Piper's story seems like it could be any woman's story - a few bad decisions can change everything.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Of the 3 seasons this is one of the better ones of the original series.  The remastering doesn't take away from the episodes either.

B00EVU3T26|5.0|I just got through watching Brian De Palma's latest film, \\"Passion\\", and have to say it's possibly the best film he's made in his entire career! Amazing how a man in his 70's can still put out such awesome movies!<br /><br />Something that I really hate is when I see so many people stating how they've recently seen a movie, and they didn't \\"get\\" it, or didn't understand it, thus the movie was bad in their opinion. No, of course it couldn't be because they just don't have the intelligence or the intellect to grasp what the filmmaker was trying to convey, no, it is because the film is bad and that's that.<br /><br />Well, that is not always the case, matter of fact, probably not the case in any one of the movies those people reviewed. There are lots of great movies out these days that have complicated, intriguing, mysterious hard-to-understand plots, but those of us who follow along and pay attention (and have higher IQ's, obviously) don't consider them \\"bad films\\" unless they are badly made.<br />And, unfortunately, over the entire past decade, Brian De Palma has been blasted so many times for making \\"bad films\\" by people who just don't understand his films (because we live in such a dumbed down world these days) it isn't even funny.<br /><br />(Oh, and just because something is described as an \\"erotic thriller\\", doesn't mean that every scene in the film is going to be some kind of titillating erotic soft-porn film for people wanting porno. So, for people complaining about this not being erotic enough, please buy a clue.)<br /><br />Now, I've been a long-time fan of De Palma's, going all the way back to when I first saw \\"Carrie\\" when it came out in 1977. And, honestly, when I first started seeing previews of \\"Passion\\", and reading some of the negative reviews, I wasn't all that excited as I've been over all of De Palma's other releases to see it.<br /><br />It just kind of looked like it would be a little too bland for want of better word, and from what I was reading, the plot was going to be over-the-top convoluted to the point of being incomprehensible.<br /><br />And, sure, the first half of the film is made with a whole new style than what De Palma fans are probably used to, but honestly, I found that most refreshing, and thought it was a brilliant choice on his behalf to film it that particular way. But, on the other hand, the entire second (and especially the third) half of the film is deliciously, deviously, dementedly De Palma in all his delectable glory.<br /><br />I'll tell you this, I'm glad I was watching it alone, because the entire last 10 minutes of the film I was shouting out, \\"Wow! Hell yeah! Wow! Hell yeah! Wow! Hell Yeah! Wow!\\" over and over, and I would have hated to have interrupted someone else's enjoyment of it.<br /><br />Plotwise, I'm not going to divulge anything at all, because to say anything about any particular moment in the film would ruin it for anyone reading this, for every moment in the film leads from one glorious surprise to another, giving the viewer twists and turns like riding a roller coaster.<br /><br />I will say, though, that the film gives De Palma the chance to work in lots of his given themes from older films, ranging from betrayal to the evil doppleganger.<br /><br />Stylewise, the film is a cornucopia of styles reflecting not only other great films of the same genre from decades past (I even caught whiffs of nods to \\"All About Eve\\"), but also from De Palma's own catalogue, ranging from split dioptor to a breath-taking split-screen scene that rates up there with the likes of \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Dressed To Kill\\".<br /><br />Anyone who hasn't seen it needs to see it NOW! You'll thank me later.<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Randall Brooks<br />(author, \\"The Two Worlds of the Mind\\"), the plot was going to be over-the-top convoluted to the point of being incomprehensible.<br /><br />And, sure, the first half of the film is made with a whole new style than what De Palma fans are probably used to, but honestly, I found that most refreshing, and thought it was a brilliant choice on his behalf to film it that particular way.

B00G2SIW7M|5.0|The album deserves to be listened to in its entirety a few times before a person's judgement. Plainly, this album tells a story, and it is far more compelling than Arcade Fire's previous album-The Suburbs. Although most music listeners are wary of their favorite bands changing their musical styles, Arcade Fire has proven to the media, public, and industry that they can \\"progress\\" without alienating longtime listeners; I put myself in that group.<br /><br />My two favorite tracks include: Porno & Afterlife.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I used to love Kindle app but the recent updates are not so good. When the updates come out, I lose my page. When I try to switch h from day to night reading,  I have about 20 attempts because it keeps closing my book. I also don't like that it doesn't provide a page number. And the text size adjustments don't do anything.  I will be finding a new reader once I complete my book.
0394400267|5.0|Tuchman is a great prose stylist who also probes widely and deeply into her subject. I get why her books were so popular:  Lots of juicy detail on the ways of ordinary and entitled 14th-century Europeans, along with a grand theme: the origins of chivalry and feudalism,  how chivalric ideals clashed with and were corrupted by the motives of real people, and the further degradation of human behavior caused by -- Tuchman argues -- social and economic stresses that infected Europe in the aftermath of the Black Plague epidemic of the late 1340s.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was one of the best, if not the best, book I've ever read. The beginning was a little slow, but it was just the right amount of time to get into the swing of things and describe what needed to be known throughout the book. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a faced paced book that will wow you and make you think. It was a very thought out book and how things wrapped up were spectacular! The ending surprised me and blew my socks off. Overall an amazing book and I recommend it to everyone and anyone. Spectacular book!

It is truly very romantic with the reality of that our journey on earth will allow us to meet ones just to share love and magic with them for a while before we separate making that event a very influencing fact in our life. Also I love the music of this film.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The honesty with which Liane Moriarty writes about human emotion in The Husband's Secret is incredible. Her descriptions in this book seem so spot on you would think she herself had experienced each wonderful and dreadful feeling. Great story, great twist.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Having read Mr. Hosseini's other novels I was excited when this book was released. After completing this book I was admittedly disappointed. The 'Kite Runner' and 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' were beautifully written, easy to follow and hard to put down. Unfortunately, I found quite the opposite with 'And the Mountains Echoed'. The story, was at times, fragmented, disjointed, and difficult to follow. There seemed to be a lot of characters and they were hard to keep track of. I felt like I needed to keep reminding myself what period of time I was reading about, as well as which characters the author was referencing.<br /><br />It certainly was not the worst book I've ever read, but it did not live up to my expectations.
034580404X|5.0|Cant put it down! nice calgon take me away kind of book. not your put you to sleep reading! recommended
B004SCRDCY|5.0|Great pulp novel about the Mafia. It's follows the Corleone family over a number of years. The book is full of blood, sex and violence but never too gratuitous. There's a large number of complex characters and this moves like lightning despite its length. If you've seen the movie it pretty much follows the book but there are some back stories and more fleshed out characters in the book. Not a masterpiece or important book but a very fun, egrossing read.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Over all I enjoyed this book. The only thing I disliked was the ending. Does Tim live? Does Savannah ever see John again?
B0049U4UP8|5.0|Easy to read and understand. Martha is my friend in the kitchen! I made the ricotta cheesecake. It was easy and delicious.
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|This thing it is cheap and made of thin plastic. It wouldn't protect anything much less the phone. Husband said  worthless.
B008220BLG|5.0|On the box it states: &#34;The greatest zombie love store ever told.&#34;  It is undoubtedly the ONLY zombie love story.  An event moves a zombie to save a human, which moves other zombies to start assessing themselves.  I do like horror movies featuring zombies, vampires, other undead, dead or magical creatures.  I just don't care for the psychopathic mutilation found in many modern horror movies.  This movie has some scary scenes, and the &#34;bonies&#34; that regular zombies seem fated to become are nasty.  But the movie is about the reawakening of humanity in the undead, and a chance for redemption.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|I love all the music this man creates -- he just gets better and better and more and more interesting.
B002KCYIEA|4.0|I was surprised this movie was as good as it was given the not so great critics' reviews. I get it's the same old &#34;fatal attraction&#34; story, but I thought it was well done and Beyonce did a really good job of acting the part. Loved her character! Don't mess with mama bear!
0316074314|2.0|After all the publicity associated with the Man Booker Prize I was very excited to read this book.  But, unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations.  Too long, too superficial, too many characters...just too much.  Also, I just never understood the chapter intros and how the astrology connected to the story.  May I add too contrived to my list as well.  Granted, I don't generally like mysteries of this sort, but have loved some of the better ones (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), but this was just NOT my cup of tea.  I had to work way too hard to straighten out the chronology and the story--and the effort just didn't pay out in the end.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another excellent book by John Grisham, one of today's great American writers at the top of his game.  Although I note a few unhappy readers in the reviews below, I think most people will find it to be an exciting page turner and courtroom drama, filled with colorful characters. Grisham writes with ease and grace, reflecting the great skill and artistry of a top American story teller.  Like so many of his books, the pages come alive and the reader can envision a movie playing before him. He writes what he knows about, for the most part:  Life in rural Mississippi, A love of the law but often a disgust with the practice of law. The evolution of the Old South with remnants of a racist, slave owning society slowly rising  from it's bitter past to be  a part of today's America. The pride and the guilt. The greed and the good. A search for the meaning of Justice--and how likely is it that justice will triumph in spite of the gladiatorial nature of our legal system.

B00BAXFECK|1.0|It was 300 pages too long. It was repetive to the point where I found myself skipping pages and wishing it would end. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Great book! Not quite as good as book 3 but still a great read! Can't wait for the next one!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Best book I have ever read by Ken Follet, and he has written some great books! Quite a departure from his espionage/thriller genre, but such a great read. If you like historical fiction and you enjoy reading about England in the 13th century, this book is for you.
B0032FPVKE|2.0|It seems like a good quality bag for the money. However, it is smaller than described. The stated height (5.7 inches) and width (4.0 inches) are close enough but it's a good inch narrower than described (7.9 vs. 6.9). It seems a previous reviewer came up with the same measurements as me. I will be returning this item.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I'm a new curly girl after my surgery.  This was a fun book I couldn't put down.  So glad I know how to make my hair sooooo cute now!!! :))  and I love sharing what I have learned.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|this is one of the best tv shows on now. and if you don't watch it you are missing out on a great show. each oure is better than the last the acting is a 10. way way to good. I hope the 2nd season will be 1/2 as good.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|I like 1st half of the album (1-7), its amazing. The depth and meaning of the lyrics + the beat .... but then the later half kinda sucked (8-13) :(
B008JFUPK8|5.0|man of steel is absolutely perfect. this is the superman,i have been waiting for. i am sick and tired of seeing superman  with one form of enemy.i.e. lex luthor. when you read the comics, his enemies are vast and most of them are ruthless. And the number one ruthless enemy is darkside. while, this form of enemies have similar background from the old superman movies, which i cant remember very well. i think this movie is good, because it brings him out as a rational being and not too soft as previous movies suggested. And for those who want him soft hearted most of the time,they should go watch smallville or  the first superman movie, which christopher reeves protrayed(may his soul rest in peace). for god sake, he is the strongest superbeing on earth and not a wossy. also for those who are complaining about the ultraviolet digital copy, dont waste your breath. the ultraviolet digital copy has expiration. so please always check the expiration before download.
B000Y7U98W|3.0|*Spoiler*<br />*Spoiler*<br /><br />2/3 of the movie was brilliant, but then the director was an idiot and made it a slasher .... totally ruined the movie. Never watching again.<br /><br />*Spoiler*<br />*Spoiler*
B007IXWL2C|2.0|It took me months to read this one when it only took me a few days to read the first one. I am so fed up of the inner goddess!!! Same old, same old.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|this is the most amazing series out right now. anyone who has started watching on hbo needs to read these. i got hooked from the show and couldnt wait for more episodes so i started reading the books and they do not dissapoint
B004J4WNL2|5.0|A life changing and liberating view on life - for both introvert and extrovert. A push forward in knowing ourselves and honoring who we are and why we're here.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So so glad it's now finally on kindle! My phone was too small to really enjoy the game. And also, I'm not using any data like on the phone
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It had suspence,intrigue and violence without all of the blood and guts.<br />Jennifer lawerance could have done a wee bit better. In one area but that that was the directors fault.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|This is an awesome REM album!  It really rounds out and sums up their career nicely.  There has never been another group like these guys and there never, ever will be again - especially since society seems to be obsessed with today's music where everyone sounds the same and has no individuality. (I call it fast food music.) I hope they reunite eventually for at least one tour and album.  I honestly can't think of anything to complain about with this CD except that Mike Mills doesn't sing lead on any of the tracks, but that has been a complaint of mine since Out of Time because I love his voice so much.<br /><br />If you are a new REM fan this would be a great introduction to their music because it really captures their essence OR if you are a loyal fan or one that has hit and missed over the years, you really need this album too.<br /><br />I really, really, REALLY wished I had been able to see this talented group of men in concert.
B009CG8DCA|2.0|This movie has stunning scenery and costumes but that can not save a tedious plot. Even worse, the movie presents imaginary events as history. Try to be a little accurate please. If you like movies about historical figures and events to be at least 10% accurate, this does not rise to that level.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very nice game. Seems very aggressive in helpful for people to use to restart a brain after a stroke situation.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|This game works on Kindle Fire first gen just fine. I like that they give multiple options for adding friends. Over all awesome game. Not too pushy for real cash. Even give options to earn in game stuff.
0316055433|3.0|This might have been a good 534 page book.  Ms. Tartt overwrites, drags out, repeats and repeats.  Eventually it becomes boring to read e-x-t-e-n-d-e-d descriptions of Theo (and Boris) drinking incredible quantities of alcohol or consuming various drugs in improbable volumes without dying, or vomiting here, there and everywhere.  And there are too many oh-not-that-again plot twists mostly involving Boris showing up just-on-time to keep the story line from following apart because Theo is too lame to punch his way out of a paper bag.  On a more positive note, the narrator of the Audiobook version, David Pittu, is outstanding.  He does a fantastic job with all the voice variations and accents.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|I just read an interview on tvguide with executive producer/director Kevin S. Bright about the blu ray sets. He did address the lack of extended episodes and he never once said that it would have been difficult or impossible to do. He merely stated that with the DVD sets, they were trying to give you more bang for the buck, but that this set is more about seeing the episodes again in a new way. That being said, I do wish they had included the extended shows, or provided an option where you could watch either the network version or the longer version. Some of the new scenes were very good and helped with the story telling.<br /><br />The episodes I've watched do look great, and there doesn't seem to be any cropping issues with the transfer to a wide screen format. The packaging is very cool, with a 3D-style image on the box and a very nice episode guide booklet inside. The box unfolds and has a nifty magnetic lock. It will look awesome in your home media collection, even though it's an odd size.<br /><br />I'm hoping that Seinfeld gets the same treatment someday soon.
B009P1WES6|4.0|Started slowly (and the writing was quite pedantic), but once it gets going, it's an entertaining read with a view unusual twists
0385537816|5.0|I had gotten these once before in paperback but didn't like it because the covers got ruined and these books are great to read and i love them, I just keep rereading them.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|The item was what I expected, it arrived very well and this is very good quality. Very good movie too!
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|This movie is a spin on Independence Day to me same plot different players.  The acting is sub par and has the look and feel of an updated Godzilla movie.  It was okay, and I'm glad I only rented it.  If I went to the Theater to see this I would have felt cheated to say the least.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|El pedido lleg&oacute; muy bien, con el tiempo que dijeron y fue lo que yo esperaba. Excelentes pel&iacute;culas para el recuerdo. En las 3 mensionan que suceden en Costa Rica!
6304712936|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  From the opening scene to the close, it is a well told masterpiece.  A visual and auditory delight with a myriad of wonderful characters.  This movie is brilliant.  What I dislike about the DVD version of the theatrical release is that it has not been restored.  You can find the Director's Cut restored and remastered, but in my opinion, the theatrical release is the better version of the film.  The Director's Cut restores scenes that are unnecessary and only lengthen a perfectly paced movie, bogging it down with a few unnecessary additions.  Fans of the movie will find the additional scenes in the director's cut interesting, but they add no real value to an already perfect movie.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|The item was what I expected, it arrived very well and this is very good quality. Very good movie too!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Works exactly as it should.  Was easy to get going with Linux.  Looks good.  No problems yet.  (I'm only using USB 2.0.)
B008JFUPK8|4.0|He's been living among us for 33 years, raised by a caring farming couple who understands what will happen if his existence gets out.  But he knows he's destined for something special, and grows into a wayfaring stranger who saves lives wherever he goes, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for a dedicated young reporter.  She finds him...just as an outcast from his homeworld does, an egomaniacal patriot who plans to remake the Earth...by killing off all of humanity.<br /><br />He is...Superman...kinda.<br /><br />Purists will probably despise MAN OF STEEL, or at least have several bones to pick with it.  I, for one, have never really been into the SUPERMAN movies per say; I'm very picky about my superheroes, at least as far as film goes, and prefer darker, layered stories than what one usually gets with Superman.  Even with DARK KNIGHT director Christopher Nolan on board as producer, and David Goyer penning the script, MAN OF STEEL is still happy fluff; there's rarely anything at stake, we know how it's gonna turn out (mostly; there's a nice twist there at the end), and we know our hero will end up happily ever after. There are a few too many flashback scenes, almost all of them repetitive, and the strongest feature a very good Kevin Costner.  And the antagonism between Michael Sheen's General Zod and Henry Cavill's Kal-El just isn't quite there; this is largely the result of shoddy dialogue for Sheen, who has moments of brilliance interspersed between by-rote delivery (as though he's aware the character could've been better written).<br /><br />What helps MAN OF STEEL stand out, and makes it worthwhile, is the crew behind it.  The film is visually stunning; say what you want about director Zack Snyder, but he always brings a visual flair to his films.  (By the way: this doesn't feel like a Snyder film until the final confrontation, which is actually quite breathtaking.)  Nolan's big-budget fingerprints are all over this, though it is wholly distinct from any of his own films.  The story itself makes little sense, and is so full of holes, if you aren't careful, you'll fall right through.<br /><br />But story isn't the point; most of us know the story.  What MAN OF STEEL sets out to do is give a fresh take on the Superman mythos, while still adhering to its roots.  It does this (again, for the most part) fairly well, thanks to the crew behind the camera, and the film's principle star in front.  In Henry Cavill, we finally have a modern Superman we don't feel bad rooting for.  Cavill is charismatic enough to bring the character to life, but has enough depth to his performance to let us know there are things ticking beneath the surface.  It's not an Oscar-caliber performance, but it's good enough to help carry the film, and that's a step up from where we've been.  While MAN OF STEEL may not have been everything its makers hoped for, it's better than what some fans feared, and should at the very least inspire anticipation for the inevitable sequel.films.

B002KKCVS2|5.0|Great fit and comfortable saddle . Easy on the feet. Would buy again. Have others and they were great also
1451666179|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite books ever. The book is split into color coded chapters, with each chapter being better than the last. I just love the art direction. It's all so simple, but full of emotion.
B00FH3Z91A|2.0|Dealing with seller was a giant pain. The case is minimal. If that is what you like, then you will love this one. I returned mine because the top flap slid around leaving the top of my phone exposed. I was told I must pay shipping BOTH ways to get a refund. I paid and shipped the product. Once I got notice they had received it back, I requested a refund. I was THEN told it would also cost me a 20% restocking fee.. WHAT I was never told this. It was a rip off all the way around. The case isn't worth what you pay for it and the seller makes the deal a no go.
0446699616|5.0|Great book I love reading this guys books keep them coming. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B000URDCC6|5.0|A true classic, incorporating so many values, beautiful scenery, historic reference, music; the casting, of Rolfe for instance, as Hitler Youth is a page for high school history students
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|VERY interesting game that you would think is easy but it isn't. NEEDS a steady hand &amp; to know when to brake it so you don't turn over and crash. Actually one of the better car games out there and for that I am Changing my 4 star rating to 5!
B0002XMKYE|5.0|It captures the spirit of a renowned American leader; high school history books gloss over the enormous contributions the military people made to the winning of WW2, ie MacArthur, Nimitz, Bradley, Alexander & Montgomery (British).  The turning of Patton's 3rd Army 90 degrees to move toward the Bulge is virtually unknown, but a feat of enormous magnitude.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchased the Hunger Games Trilogy for my Kindle quite a while ago.  Life got busy and I had several other books in my que to read.  I should have skipped them all.  This was the best book I have read in a long time.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This watch is so slim and classic. It is good for sports wear or dressy. The price on line is much less than you would spend in a store. great bargain great watch. Love the mesh band too.
B0095D8ZAA|5.0|Very addictive!  My favorite is the grand canyon, it is a challenge.  I play this with my grandson.he likes to challenge me.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|This actually was a decent story. It was nice to finally see the Madd Addam story progress. I was a bit disappointed in the second book of the series and expected more of the same in this one. I guess having low expectations helps.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read the reviews for this book and knew I had to read it. I was not disappointed...it is an amazing book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It took what felt like a lifetime, but finally after a past that probably would never really be forgotten, life moved on. A novel which encompasses good overtaking evil. Interesting to see what actually occurs in a court room and the way the losing attorney tried to misrepresent the true facts to the jury. The final outcome will be a surprise.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Go to Load Game and scroll all the way down. The very last slot is an auto save. Great game. Love that you can earn moves to keep! Wish every game did this.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Dang near perfect sci-fi action film.  I love the premise, the origin, the lead actors, the costumes, graphics, action and detail.  Great fun to watch if you are into escaping from reality for a couple of hours.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It started off really well but when we got to the court room it bogged down.  Got a little boring.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|All around good sci-fi action film, but it seemed a little cold or impersonal to me.  I enjoyed it, just not enough to give it the fifth star.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|The Honor of the Queen(Honor Harrington) by David Weber<br /><br />Once more I'm reading the next Honor Harrington novel to try to understand why I like them so much. One might ask why( I'm doing this) and this came about because in trying to read the newest of the series I found myself making constant starts and stops and wondering what has changed. Obviously the most changed factor would seem to be me. (Since some of these books are twenty years old it is that long ago that I first read them.)<br /><br />I really love this book the first three times I read it and I still do but this time I tried to pay particular attention to why. And I discovered first that the style of writing is one that I would describe for myself as a reader as the writing that reads like a bad LP plays on a player. There are passages that are like a scratch on a record and you suddenly find yourself at the bottom of the page wondering how you managed to skip those last three paragraphs. I realize that in the best description I can give I have been scanning large portions of this book to get to the parts I like.<br /><br />This in fact is caused by the massive walls of techo-babel that seem so important to the tactics of battle that will play out later. It's quite interesting because it does add some element of depth to that part of the story and it suddenly made me realize that the main character in this story often seems to be the techno-babel. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it can be annoying to some readers. There is still a lot of world building going on here and David has a lot to tell us about this new system where Grayson is. There is a lot of political and religious background that goes into the telling of this story. In fact it all might be considered Techno-Politico-Religio-babel. That's a trifecta destined to either awe or bore.<br /><br />What I love about these novels is the character of Honor Harrington. She's one of the best female protagonists in this type of science fiction and yet she is in some ways the worst. I say this because David Weber seems to have difficulty in directly accessing the true emotions of Honor Harrington. I believe that its an effort to make her some uber war strategist that might impair this process. Most, not all, of her emotions are throttled until something within the context of her general macho nature goes beyond the pale. Let's translate that to the type of character Clint Eastwood plays so well. The kind that shows few emotions until he's pushed beyond some limit. That means most of the time we see Honor as a dispassionate soldier. Oh sure she has her opinions of politics and other such things but they are all driven and focused into her military career. This is probably quite accurate for what David is going for here, but it creates that sort on one dimensional character that people can't peer around without loosing sight of since the other side of the page is blank.<br /><br />What David does do is give insight into much of Honor's character through how other characters see her. The problem with that is is that it's no holds barred in the field because it ranges from everyone from close friend to worst foe.  Mostly this ends up creating caricature's of these other characters who are being judged by how they perceive the protagonist and that perception is colored by the reader's own opinion of what Honor is (as they see her). The largest window into Honor is in chapter Twenty Six and her reaction to the way the prisoners of war were treated. Unfortunately the focus on the treatment of the women in particular causes the rest to pale, but the overall reaction in Honor is again a good indication of what this woman soldier is all about. Sad to say that's a small portion of this long book.<br /><br />The interesting part of all of this one dimensional nature of Honor is that in a way David Weber is leaving it open for the reader to fill in a lot of the blanks based on the information and misinformationtraveling through the thoughts of others. This is actually normally a good trick in writing-not telling the reader everything and letting them think for themselves. It obviously works quite well here because more people like these books than those who don't. The caveat here is that those who don't can't grasp the fundamental to why they don't like it other than that the characters are all flat.<br /><br />David has an interesting opinion and take on the directions that politics, religion, and technology  might shape the future and unfortunately the reader gets a lot of this in long bouts of telling that leave little to the imagination though sometime it left me scratching my head.  The biggest stumbling block for Honor this time might be this sexist thing with the Graysons and its in Chapter Twenty that we see Honor putting the nails to that coffin by her selfless act (which she later tries to minimize by stating she was only protecting herself.)<br /><br />And just like many of those protagonists of the great movies everyone around Honor gets killed and injured while she walks away with all the guilt and the rewards. Once again the most heroic people are those who have cleaved to this their leader and have marched off to their deaths in defense of honor and country (world).<br /><br />This is a great read for SFF fans who like a lot of techno-babel and somewhat authentic sounding space battles and strategy.<br /><br />Once again I loved this story, but I'm not sure if I see the same Honor Harrington that David wrote about by the time I reach the end, and I don't think that that is such a bad thing.<br /><br />J.L.

B0096DZKZC|1.0|Does not load on kindle fire. This app  sucks for kindle fire. I know it's a big file but I know I had space for it.

B006M4F67A|4.0|This game is much better than any. F the other games except Magjong deluxe.  The sound effects are annoying.  Also a few more characters would be nice.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fun, not to overly easy, and mostly free, what's not to like? The only reason I won't give this game a 5 Stat rating is due to the slightly awkward way in which my Warmage shoots her basic attack.<br />Overall for a mobile game this is quite lovely.
B00F031WB8|5.0|A comprehensive account of the life of a rock icon whose life was cut too short and left us hungering for more of his magical musical genius. Lots of film footage of Jimi talking which I have never seen before.

B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It is good but not up to A Time to Kill. Sequels are hard. I always liked Grisham anyway .

B005UBNKZG|5.0|I've been using the 8120 for a year now and it has handled all I could throw at it.  My system is routinely handling processor intensive games while running other tasks in the background, yet my CPU load never goes above 40% in a worse case scenario.  It blows the quad-core AMD I was previously running right out of the water.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the stock heat sink and fan is insufficient for the processing weight this chip can handle.  If you're buying an 8120 you probably know the basics behind heat dissipation and intelligent case design.  If not, look it up on the Internet and make sure you're not skimping on the PC case.  Do that and it'll treat you right.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Many awesome actions and the spells are d&amp;d worthy. I've enjoyed this game since I first opened it up and started playing it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game. Totally worth the $7. Almost never crashed and the graphics are amazing for a game on a handheld device. The missions are the perfect length and the story is great. It's almost like call of duty but it is better than the COD franchise in my opinion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My hole family started playing then they got me hooked we all really like it. l think everyone should at least try it.I rate it a ten
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is amazing and i highly recommend it its even good for kids of any age but i mean who can go wrong with monkeys and balloons
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great storytelling, but I found the last book to be a bit ponderous. I might have enjoyed the last book more if I hadn't read it right after I read the other two.
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|Needs an off switch. Having to shut kindle off to exit is ridiculous. Have other games by the developer. They have exit buttons. King oddball is a good game. Just pick up and play. Really basic game one touch control. Levels set up in blocks. Clear all screens in a block to open next level. It's about as simple as games get.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I really loved the beginning but the middle was so tedious I lost interest.<br />Better editing was needed here. I could not torture myself any longer so chose not to finish book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love books that keep you in Spence until the very end. Going have to finish the others to find out how it all turns out
B00902AKK4|4.0|This is a very fun little puzzle-quest game.  Solving the puzzles to obtain the quest items is genuinely challenging.  The protagonist is very likeable.  The soundtrack is terrific too.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I love this move, it is one of my favorites! Was glad it find it on DVD after my VHS got eaten by an old VCR.....
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Interesting story about a young boy and the friend he meets at the end of the lane. Well told from the perspective of the young boy who returns to his home town as an adult for a funeral.  A little supernatural!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderfully done story. Can really Feel for Katniss. A frightening alternate future portrayal. Makes one think ofo 1983 only with some bad twists
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Man of Steel is, in my opinion, a great re-introduction of Superman to the big screen.  Zack Snyder did an awesome job at giving new life to a character that has been off the big screen for about eight years.  A great deal was riding on this film from the beginning.  Superman has not been in theaters for a long time and the three installments that came before it (Superman 3, Superman 4, and Returns) have ranged from subpar to just plain abysmal.  Snyder had to have been under a great deal of pressure to make this movie good and, in my opinion, he succeeded.  This is probably my favorite Superman movie to date.  I even enjoy this a little more than the first Superman movie.  In fact this is probably my second favorite incarnation of Superman (first being Superman TAS).  I like that Snyder made the film more realistic, as least as far as Superman goes.  He also made it darker, but not dark like the Nolan Batman films.  For all those people who are expecting to see a movie as dark as those film, then you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The cast is decent though I do have some issues.  Henry Cavill does an awesome job as Superman.  He is not as good as Christopher Reeve or Tim Daly, but he does do an adequate job at filling their shoes.  Superman in this film is made more human than in any of the other movies, even the first one.  Clark is a good person to look up to but not to the point where we cannot relate to him.  The moral dilemma he goes through in the beginning of the film makes him feel very real.<br />Amy Adams is not bad as Lois Lane but I did not love her as the character.  She does not have a lot of the wit and spunk that Lois Lane is supposed to have.  To me Margot Kidder is still the best Lois Lane.  I, however, do like how Lois is given a bigger role in the plot instead of being Superman’s love interest and the damsel-in-distress.  She is given more to do here than in any of the other movies which I like.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does an amazing job playing Jor-El.  He is a great leader and a good father figure for Clark.  I also like how he helps Clark and Lois out in the movie.  I personally believe that Crowe’s performance in this film is on par with Marlon Brando’s.  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent do a decent job as well.  They also play the parental figures pretty well.<br /><br />It pains me to say it but I did not like the villain Zod here.  The character is right but the actor, Michael Shannon, did nothing for me.  He does not sell the character of Zod well at all.  Compared to Terrance Stamp and even the Zod in Smallville Shannon’s performance was lacking.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne as Perry White does a good job also.  The fact that Perry is black instead of white in this film does not bother me as long as the actor can pull of the role, which he does.  He plays the character of Perry well, but he is not given much to do.<br />The effects are easily the selling point of the film.  The effects in this movie are vastly superior to the effects in any of the previous installments.  This film looks even better than Superman Returns.  I did not see this in 3D so I cannot comment on how good the 3D is.<br /><br />The thing I liked most is how they portray Krypton.  In any other continuity, including the previous movies, Krypton is portrayed as an ice planet, and the Kryptonians’ technology derived from crystals.  That is not the case here.  The Kryptonian technology is like something you see in Star Wars or the new Star Trek movies.  I also love how they go into the culture and history of Krypton and why Zod betrayed them.  I do not recall this being done to this extent in any of the other movies.  There are things that they added to the Kryptonian mythos that deviates from the source material but it works well.<br /><br />The fight scenes are phenomenal.  The action in this film trumps the action in the other movies by leaps and bounds.  I was waiting for the day I wouldfinally see action of this caliber in a Superman movie.  The action scenes are fun, explosive, and intense, though several really drag on.  I especially love the fight between Superman and Zod, though it ends on a controversial note.  Many Superman fans will probably not like how the fight ends.  I also found it weird but it did not ruin anything for me.<br /><br />Overall this is a great re-introduction to Superman for both longtime fans and a new audience.  Any Superman fan should be excited.  I am very much looking forward to future installments.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|A lot of the ideas in this book are well researched and help a ton!! Other ideas in this book I have not tried. Listen, fad diets are silly, just stop being an idiot and work out a tiny bit and eat right. If that fails, use things like this. I wish people in America weren't so fat, it makes me sad. I once went to the mall and saw a really overweight person stuck on an escalator. Maybe he wasn't stuck, I don't know, I was shopping and didn't pay that close attention. Oh wait, it wasn't the mall, it was at my house. I think it was a turkey. Point is, I like Thanksgiving.
B009CG29RK|4.0|This was very funny and I found myself laughing outloud a couple of times.  I enjoyed it more than my toddler did I think but we both liked it. The minions are funny and Steve Carrel is great.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased this case Jan 2012 (almost 2 yrs ago) and it still looks brand new...my kindle has never rec'd a scratch or a ding (and my toddler plays with it all the time and trust me when I say it's been tossed all over the place). It does exactly as advertised with standing up on it's side and the rubber strap has never been stretched out.  The cover looks nice so I totally think it's worth the extra expense. I would def buy this brand again for any future tablets!
B000I0D450|3.0|Acting is good but script is a little weak. It is entertaining if you're in the mood to watch an all star cast do a great job with a weak, yet interesting script.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|what can I say, i'm addicted on FB and now I can continue to play on my kindle at 3am since it's linked to my FB acct :)
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a very fun game to play.  Each board was more exciting.  Will be teaching my God daughters to play.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I don't watch TV--but I am addicted to this show!!<br />Smart, well-written, sexy and great acting!<br />Watching 3-4 episodes at a time--love Amazon instant video!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Not literature but very entertaining. Clever universe that's described well. Likeable characters engaged in a well-paced adventure. Reads like an action movie, which it will be soon.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This set is very expensive. That would be the major detractor. Another downside practically speaking would be the fact that it's rather large. The size contributes to the awesome factor but at the same time, it consumes space for quite a while. It takes some time to build and then you've worked so hard you don't want to take it down again.<br /><br />I love the amount of minifigures included. You get all the classic characters, even a few versions of the important ones. The trash compactor is just all right, but most of the other moving parts have the impressive marks of Lego ingenuity.<br /><br />I also love that it takes a long time to build. That helps a little in terms of coming to grips with the fact that you just dropped $400 on a big toy.<br /><br />The fact that it's 90% gray can get a little tedious. The thing took me about 12 hrs to build. Definitely not doable for me in a day. With 2-3 people you could probably be done in a few hrs though. Then the limiting factor would be the directions. There are two instruction books, if I remember correctly. I guess just because there were so many instructions to give.<br /><br />If you love Star Wars and Legos and can afford this monstrosity, definitely go for it. You'll have hours of fun (I mean your kids will be entertained for a very long time).
B004EPYZZI|5.0|this is a great \\"feel good\\" family night feel good movie. It shows the spirit and strength of a girl and her family.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|This band is awesome and I hope they get invited to Firefly Music Festival because they deserve it. Anyway, the songs range from mellow to upbeat. Not all of the songs are focused on love (always appreciated). The album is both dance-y and exciting yet somehow refined.<br />This album is a good investment.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Very well made and very interesting.  My husband was the sailing master of a tall ship and he cannot find any fault with this movie like he does so many others
B00BS7HNTK|5.0|Edward has a great voice. This band is edgy, indie and refreshing. Definitely more upbeat and has very interesting lyrics.
B003FC3LQK|5.0|The music and dance moves make this an all time favorite!  The story isn't the greatest, but makes a great vehicle for the music and dance.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is wonderful. I wish I had read it earlier. I am an extremely picky reader and for me to sit down, addicted, and plow through chapter after chapter is rare. Chbosky offers beautiful micro details and philosophical thoughts. If you are not in love with Charlie by the end of this book then you are a dalek with no emotional value and I expect the Doctor will come and take care of you post haste.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions, I love all The different places you can go. It's very addicting. Passes time when your board.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This band is upbeat most of the time and wonderfully funky. I listen to their album and I'm like, &#34;Dude they're weird.&#34; But I love that they're weird. Lead vocals are truly unique and the band has an indie feel.
B000NUXAUO|5.0|Because this is some of Elvis's best music<br />and at 65, I am still an Elvis fan  The record<br />is in fantastic shape and I love it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVE THESE BOOKS MORE THAN ANASTASIA LOVES CHRISTIAN!!! E.L. James is a perfect mastermind who can really write a book
B00FLNRN06|5.0|laugh out loud funny, the entire movie I could not control my laughter one of the top ten comedy's of 2013.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We love this Chromecast and I would have given it 5 stars, but it was difficult to get it started.<br />When we plugged it into the TV, it did not want to stay one.<br /><br />We've had a few other issues with it.<br />Sometimes it does not want to work and we have to keep retrying it.<br /><br />When it does work, it is awesome.<br /><br />I would recomment it to friends.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very entertaining. Can't stop playing. Would be nice if new update is available but still a lot to play. Great.
159463176X|5.0|This is an inspiring read. However, you really need to pay close attention and at times review all of the previously woven stories. There's a Citizen Kane &#34;Rosebud&#34; moment where you'll have to go back to the the beginning of the book to figure out the last pages. It's worth the time to reread certain sections to figure out the entire book. I wanted to know what happened to Nabi's sister who goes to Kabul but she kind of fades away.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|A timeless classic that is STILL being used by college students at the College of Charleston.  I bought this for both my 13-yr old son and my 18-yr of daughter who is a college freshman.
0780619587|5.0|David's path back to performing? Gilliam's gift with David -  was it just her personality? This lovely based-in-fact movie makes me want to know more.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|I first heard this beautiful theme while watching promo's of PBS,the promo's said in the caption,&#34;This belings to you&#34;.and this beautiful song was playing,John Barry I remember was also the composer for the James Bond,films,he is a prolific composer,writing some beaufitul tunes,they may not have lyrics,but the melodies,are just beautiful,they can touch the persons heart,soul and spirit,just as other great music can touch the heart.God bless John Barry.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|this is another great title from noodlecake. the game is a fun and engaging action platformer. I'vehad a lot of fun with it so far, but this otherwise 5 star app suffers from frequent crashing on galaxy s3. untiI i can play more than 10 minutes without crashing and losing earned coins, 3 stars isall u can offer
1577314808|5.0|I love this book. It is very unfortunate how many people live their lives without really living. A must buy for anyone who wants more than just a cell phone and food.
B005COO1X6|4.0|fast pace in King's style ... exciting, it has the expected dose of gruesome but the ending made me laugh.....
B001HN69AY|3.0|Ever watch a movie that makes you feel stupid and shallow?  \\"The Imaginarium\\" is one of those, and unless you're such a fan of the late Heath Ledger that you'd watch him read the dictionary, you can probably miss this one and have quite a satisfying life.  Philosophically challenging is great, but this movie works too hard to be just plain obscure.  Interesting imagery, but weird.  Watch it if you dare or smoke a lot of pot.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The worst scenario description was amazing!! I think that the way the story describes the &#34;what if&#34; is just perfect
B002GHHHKG|2.0|I had been warned that \\"City of Angels\\" was a pathetic remake of \\"Wings of Desire\\", but was determined to judge for myself.  Sadly, that opinion seems accurate, as it's obvious the \\"City\\" filmmakers didn't really understand the original, trying unsuccessfully to duplicate a world in which angels are everywhere, watching, guiding and occasionally envying human life, without any of the spiritual depth or magic essential to making a unique and believable statement.  Nicolas Cage as an angel looks like he's experiencing painful gas and Meg Ryan falls in love with him for no reason whatsoever. The borrowed aspects are speeded up as if American audiences consist of hyperactive dolts, and though the original is paced slowly for this American viewer, the end result is that  \\"City\\" is a cheap, commercial film, while \\"Wings of Desire\\" is a genuine work of art.  \\"City's\\" ending is unnecessary and irritating but just in case you actually buy this turkey, I won't reveal it.  See for yourself if you must, or watch \\"Wings of Desire\\".
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The perpelexu epic is a wonderful game, is challenging for all family, i have the original perplexus and is amazing too, but the epic is more dificult
B00005JKNC|5.0|Not only is this one of Jim Carrey's best films, it's pure Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart, and in a modern, cynical world, it's not easy to pull that off.  The setting is the post-WW2 McCarthy Era, and Carrey is a young film writer who's about to be indicted for Communist activities even though he's only guilty of attending a \\"food-not-war\\" party while pursuing a girl during his college years. Distraught over what he knows will be the death of his burgeoning career, he drives up the California coast while contemplating his unfair fate, and is involved in an accident which leaves him with amnesia, embraced by the people in a small town that lost many of its young men to the war.  Carrey resembles a local war hero, who's been MIA for nine years; or perhaps the townspeople just want to believe he's survived, and adopt this stranger into their lives and hearts.  The long gone son of the man who owned the now-closed  Majestic cinema also comes with a gorgeous girlfriend with whom Carrey becomes involved, but it's all sweet, never perverse. Carrey never really believes he's who the locals think he is, but he goes along with it because he brings such joy to everyone around him.  The rebuilding of the theater is pure Capra and somehow manages not to be corny, as does the \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" ending.  Maybe it's because I'm a film buff and fascinated by the heroism of WW2, but I love this movie, can't recommend it enough.  It seems a kicked-under-the-carpet sleeper for Carrey, and it's a pity; it's one of his best, most heart-felt performances and may enable you to forgive him for talking through his butt.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|My kids love it,<br />I even plat it sometimes and I can't put the device down when I play it
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is far more efficient and accurate than the stock android keyboard. By learning your writing style, if makes excellent predictions and helps me type faster.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I kept getting Facebook things from my friend but had resisted downloading the game. Know that I have, I can't put it down.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Addictive!!! Way more strategic than Angry Birds. We love figuring out physics problems like how to create lift, angles, drag, etc. This is a fun way to learn those aspects of design. We have since bought the full version and play it regularly. Still love it after many months.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|So far the book is pretty good. Her style and humor make the book easy to read. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars is because I have not completed reading the book!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This movie has three great Hollywood actors a must see for anyone who likes mafia movies,I saw part of this movie on tv and had to buy the dvd
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A fantastic application for keeping the Bible close at hand.  It has allowed me to use my kindle and my smart phone for Bible version when I travel.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Seemed to rush to the ending - would have been better if it was split into a 4th book. Too much time was invested in these characters by the reader to have it end like a &#34;synopsis of the end&#34;.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Entertaining and compelling from start to finish! Beautifully animated with an engrossing story and a lively cast of characters!<br /><br />A great movie for families to watch! The kids will be entertained by the wild variety of characters and action, and the adults will be entertained by the fast dialogue and subtle humor.<br /><br />Overall, the movie has a lot of heart and is fun to watch!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|It works as its supposed to work. Its compact size makes it easy to place in most cars junk spaces. Cheaper than getting a charger from bestbuy and since we all mostly have extra micro usb cables, its the choice charger for most modern gadget carriers.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|I liked everything about this book. Can't wait for the sequel to be released. Thank for the pleasure of reading! Vladimir
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Picking this up was really a treat. I have not bought a Metallica album since the Black album and this has rekindled my interest in checking out their newer material. The sound quality on this is excellent and James sounds great and Kirk is blistering as usual. The sound of the drums and bass is tight and heavy and pretty close to perfection. One glitch for around 5-7 seconds as other have mentioned on Ride The Lightning due to the tesla coil (which has to be the coolest stage prop ever!) but that does not ruin the song for me. Truly a great release and a must for any \\"old-school\\" Metallica fan. One question, why only one week in IMAX. I would LOVE to see this on IMAX, please bring it back!!! It is hard to pick favorite songs on this but Wherever I May Roam is incredible, And Justice For All is brutally good, and all of the old stuff is stunning! Special mention to the new version (not live) of Orion...mindblowing! Well done boys!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great novel you cannot put down. Just when you know the plot, it changes.  Jake, attorney for a will , is remarkable and part of little town Mississippi
0060578793|5.0|Book has been really useful and seems to have a lot of really great information!!<br /><br />Looking forward to reading through the remainder of it.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Mommy Dearest on steroids! If this is all true it certainly points out how some people really should NOT have children! Off spring of the rich and famous are not always to be envied when their parents are totally selfish and self serving. By the end of this book I really had a huge lack of respect for Shirley MacLaine.
0307474259|5.0|It answered a lot of questions that I had about obesity. I am not obese but interested in the subject since it affects some members of my family.  (I am 5 ft 8 inches and weigh 175).
B000MR1V22|5.0|Great character plot of some extreme individuals.<br /> You will love it from start to finish. Sit back, relax, have a chuckle, and enjoy!!
1609611543|5.0|This book is another eye opener.  It explains the real truth about how wheat is responsible for the present world wide obesity epidemic.
B004JHYRDQ|4.0|It's a scifi classing by a Grand master.  A must read for anyone who wants to understand his influence on science fiction.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|Cool for a collector. The book is nice and I thought it was clever the way the discs formed the angel.
0920668372|5.0|This is a circle of life story that I read to my infants from day one. I sang the &#34;poem&#34; to them and 25 years later they can still sing it back to me.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Anyone can call themselves the greatest, but it takes the skills and the grit to back it up. That is what Greatest Poet Alive has: the elements it takes to not just be called great but to be great. He shows it in a big way in his book REVENGE OF THE ORGASM.<br /><br />As an individual who is a lover of words I can say that he is able to paint a picture in a way that leads just enough to the imagination while satisfying the curious nature of readers. As if he is painting the perfect picture, REVENGE doesn't waste a single word. Every line, each image is just what you need to take a journey you'll not soon forget.<br /><br />Some people are meant to follow a trail. Others are destined to forget their own. Read REVENGE OF THE ORGASM and you'll see why G.P.A. is the latter.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Entertaining!  Lots of action.  A fun adventure with the hero winning and loyal to his family.  A chance to get away from the real world for A Couple of hours where the good guy is a good guy.
0307593312|2.0|I can't stand one single character in this book, Honestly - how can you write something this huge and not have one single character that inspires some kind of positive feeling??? I believe, once you add this fact to the total confusion that presents itself as a story line you will find no reason to read this huge book.
076115678X|4.0|I really like this book. I got some very good advice, some I'm sure I could've found on the internet, but I like to re-read books. I had always rinsed my conditioner because I thought it would weigh my hair down if I left it in. Now, I just splash water on the top of my head, and squeeze the excess out with a t-shirt, add a leave in and a serum, and plop.  After reading the book, I have switched to a no sulfate shampoo and a no &#34;cones&#34; conditioner. I am seeing a difference in my hair and liking it. I have followed a lot of the advice for my curly/wavy hair which has always had a mind of its own, lol. As I've gotten older, I have just learned to enjoy my hair and let it be itself. My hair is not as dry and frizzy, I wish it was even less frizzy, but I am confident that the more I keep treating my hair like this, the better it will be. Very enjoyable book.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. A modern classic that shouldn't be missed. I hope the price drops soon.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Well I must say, Lady Gaga outdid herself. I am a true avid Little Monster fan but I'll keep this as unbiased as possible.<br /><br />First and foremost, the first time you hear this album, maybe you'll think, \\"Why is half of the album all about sex then drops down to something emotional?!\\" Well here's the thing, Lady Gaga tried to show the \\"nakedness\\" of ART and POP. As you may have noticed, the first half of the album is about love, or making love. In my opinion, that's the Sphere of POP. Pop Music nowadays (some if not most) are about sex, love or lust which she wanted to show in the first half. She wanted to show the state of Pop Music now but still present it in a way that it's not too sexual or lusty as much as possible. The first track, \\"Aura\\", is about her showing what's under all that make-up, dresses, etc. It's like boarding the airplane, welcoming you aboard and greeting you with open arms. Following \\"Aura\\" is \\"Venus\\" or for the album, the flight to the truth behind the \\"aura\\". After that, it just develops into songs about love and making love but has that same deep meaning as any other Pop Songs out there. As you can hear, it gradually decreases the love part as it goes to the middle track of the album.<br /><br />Now, as you may have noticed, \\"Artpop\\" is the middle track of the album. It's like the song says, \\"We could, We could, belong together (ARTPOP)\\". It's about bringing the POP and ART together making them meet in the middle.<br /><br />Which brings us to the ART side of the album. This side will greet you with \\"Swine\\". At first, I'm not gonna lie, I didn't understand the meaning of this song until I kept on listening to it and doing a little research. As I understand it, it's about shaking of the man who wants to keep on having meaningless sex with her which held her from achieving the star status, which is a good track after all that \\"love songs\\". The message of the song continues on with shaking of the dark past. This continues on to other songs with deep meanings that, like art, you need to listen carefully to understand the true meaning of. This side is full of songs about becoming who she is today, and gaining the \\"Applause\\".<br /><br />This album offers different varieties of music. From Raps to Ballads, this album can satisfy most, if not all, the music lovers out there. To sum it up, this album is about the story of how Lady Gaga came to be if you listen to it carefully. From making herself vulnerable to the world while starting the career to the current state she's in wherein she can't live without her fans' \\"Applause\\".<br /><br />To conclude this review, I would like to encourage you to buy this album. You may just own the album of the century. Full of songs with meanings that are priceless. You won't regret buying this. The album Lady Gaga has worked on for 2 years really did pay off. With albums like these, surely the artist who made it will ALWAYS be remembered.<br /><br />*Additional Review: The Album cover is a work of art. I love it especially with the foil cover.
1616551607|5.0|Amazing art collection at an unbeatable prize. A must for any Final Fantasy fan. The art is character-focused, with a lower proportion of background and concept art.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love this game. It doesn't take up space on a table to do puzzles and kids can't mess it up.  I really like t that there are tons of puzzles and you can choose how many pieces you want the puzzle to be.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am not a huge fan of games that require you to connect with others via social media in order to proceed through certain levels. I do not like to broadcast details regarding the what and when of the games I am playing. I also do not care for limited gameplay dependent on passage of time or having to ask friends for extra lives. CCS annoyingly has all these gimmicks. Since the game is enjoyable and challenging and it does not require routine social media blasting, I have given it a high rating. If you enjoy social media games AND puzzle games, this will likely be a five star game for you.
B001NESPHC|5.0|This is by far her best album.  Every cut is great.  We have just about worn out the CD playing it so many times.  We are hopping she does another one closer to this than her current album. She is amazing and so natural.
B00005RYKU|2.0|The movie played great until the middle of the movie and then it started to skip scenes backward I had to fast forward back to the scene. I had to do it at least 4 times I should have expected it by it being used.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I remember hearing about Ender's Game some time before the movie was mentioned, but had never actually read it until seeing trailers for the movie jogged my memory again, and I decided to take the plunge and finally read this book.  Before getting into a review of it, first let me say that there is a lot of story surrounding the book since it is involving children and very smart children at that.  It is polarizing in a sense that the age and biases people have seem to dictate how enjoyable the book is.  Kids love it, especially bright children again, because they can relate to it, where parents see it as horrifying that children could act this way.  I wanted to state this because I think going into this book without preconceived expectations can yield the best reading experience.  Just take the book for what it is, not for what you want to read in between the lines.<br /><br />Now for the review itself:<br /><br />The book takes place in the far future where humanity is up against a terrible threat in the Buggers, an alien species of insectoids seeking to wipe out humanity.  The timing of the story is set already into the war with Buggers and the crux is that humanity's defenders are looking to children to become the next great commander that will save humanity from the brink of annihilation.  Enter Ender Wiggin and his trials in becoming this commander.<br /><br />Progressing through the story, Ender goes through many battles and experiences that are pleasant to read about and leads you to wanting more in each following page.  However, the story also diverges where it includes Ender's brother and sister, Peter and Valentine.  While it is interesting to see how these two operate since they are of the same ilk as Ender, their story ultimately is unsatisfying and lends nothing to the overall story.  The culmination of these events happen, and....that's it.  Now, there are multiple books in the Ender series, so there may be something in the following books pertaining to these events, but for Ender's Game it is disappointing.<br /><br />The ending of Ender's Game is very disappointing, also, as there is such a long build up for the entirety of the book, and after the resolution, it just seems to end in a quickly thrown together chapter while introducing other story points that leave you with a \\"Huh...?\\" feeling.  Again, there are other books in the series that may address this, but after the resolution, it seems that Card didn't know what to do with his story.<br /><br />However, after a certain reveal during the book, it does ask a very good question to the reader: When you (Ender) are operating under certain pretenses and act in a certain way, would you still act in that way when the pretenses change?<br /><br />Reading through Ender's Game though is enjoyable, and I would recommend that you pick up the book.  It's cheap (especially if you're getting it on Kindle), not very long, and the language is easy to read through and understand.  It gives an interesting viewpoint of placing extremely bright children into a school environment but with pressures raised to an almost unbearable level and seeing how their interactions with each other result.<br /><br />At worst, it's a same old, same old sci-fi future thriller, but at its best, it can be a book leading to some interesting insight into children's minds and how they view the world and its problems with a good story on the side.o these events, but for Ender's Game it is disappointing.<br /><br />The ending of Ender's Game is very disappointing, also, as there is such a long build up for the entirety of the book, and after the resolution, it just seems to end in a quickly thrown together chapter while introducing other story points that leave you with a \\"Huh...?\\" feeling.

B0083Z614S|5.0|Always a wonderful reread!  Takes you back to childhood. Touching story. Timeless, loved spending the evening with Colin Mary and Dickon again.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|We're the Millers reunites Jason Sudeikis, former SNL regular, and Jennifer Aniston who both starred in Horrible Bosses.<br /><br />A low level pot dealer played by Sudeikis runs into inventory issues, and has to put together an unlikely family of misfits, which includes a down on her luck stripper (Aniston), a homeless girl (Emma Roberts), and a virgin to pose as a family of smugglers who can get across the border without attracting suspicion.  Good luck.<br /><br />Complications, and numerous adventures occur, and is the stripper hard hearted, or does she have a heart of gold?<br /><br />What impressed me most in watching this movie was Sudeikis' vast improvement and his presence and charisma in the movie.<br /><br />In previous movies he has been the also ran among greater stars, but here he occasionally displays a charisma reminiscent of George Clooney in his comedy roles, and I think this movie will prove to be a major breakthrough role for him, and put him on the map as a leading actor.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston displays her usual comedy skills, and there are a couple of raunchy stripper scenes which display her physique very well.  Emma Roberts,  Julia Roberts niece, shows that that she is a creditable actress in her own right.  There are a number of awkward and highly inventive situations developed to great comedic effect, and to tell you more might ruin the spontaneity of your experience.<br /><br />Our two main stars will also be appearing in the Horrible Bosses sequel due out next year.<br /><br />I think most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.
0399159347|5.0|I LOVED this book. Granted, my expertise on married life/drama is limited with only being twenty and married for only a little over a year. But I still loved it. I love the writing style and the story drew me in. I COULD not put the book down and the &#34;secret&#34; is a doozy. Moriarty plays a lot with &#34;what ifs&#34; and what the outcomes of them WOULD have been and it really made me think.<br /><br />It is an easy read, no doubt. But I can very easily see myself rereading this book!

1451666179|5.0|I am a huge fan of Allie's blog, so of course I love the book.<br /><br />That being said, as someone who has had their bouts with depression and ADHD throughout my life, Allie has a really beautiful way of describing what it's like in my (and I am assuming many others') heads in a very funny way. I love this book for her lovely and funny illustrations and the writing style as well. She has a real gift in my opinion, and I hope we see more from her in the future!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I think this book is the best book ever I do not no way to say it was great I love it so much

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|How could anyone not love this? Heck, the pictures of Gaga in the digital booklet are worth the price alone.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|So my friend bought an item like this one a few weeks ago and after seeing how cool it was i decided to get one. I was suprised to see how sturdy it is for, essentially, a plastic toy. The UV light shines brightly (though not quite a full flashlight) and i hear 4 distinguishable sounds. The build it sturdy and hold up nicely in its extended or in its closed position. Overall a great product assuming you don't plan on taking on the Cyberman amry on with it.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Great movie, exciting and sad. The beggingng was awsome and the scenario of the film was one of a kind.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is my most fav out of all the other apps in the app store you get to create and play on survival so worth the $6.99
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Baby loves this thing. There is so much to do he wants to stay in it for over 30 minutes at a time. He loves it and it lets us eat dinner in peace.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pretty cool game,it not quite like hunting,but it's a good start. Need calls,blinds,&amp; fourwheelers. I love the slow motion when u shoot though. It's like an adrenalin shot!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|i love this game, build city, build tanks and shoot. i enjoy it enough where i spent money on the game but now i want to delete it off my device. the word killing is offensive and not aloud to be typed. really? i just dropped napalm on little soldiers and they died. for that one reason i may not play this game no more.
B0015DWJX2|2.0|If you want a light, cute read, this may be for you, but there is really no depth to the story. I easily grew tired of it and felt the main character to be very fake. Admittedly, the book is written in letter form, and I don't usually like that style as well.
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is one of the best games ever! I think I play this game every single day. Whoever made this game, couldn't have made it any better. :)
B000FBJF6Y|1.0|Let's be honest, I didn't even finish this book. I have no idea what the fuss is about. It just plain sucked, sorry.
B00GOA27LU|1.0|I really want to see this episode which aired yesterday on the 14th and its not letting me buy it damn it! It would be really cool if it was on amazon at the time of the ending on TV or even at the same time it airs on TV would be nice!! I'd give this series/show 10* stars if I could! But I have to give amazon 1*star because its not letting me view the show as of now 11/15/13.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I wish I could give this more stars. The characters were great. The writing was good. The situations were engaging. But there were some things I couldn't get over. What was up with the constant Berlin Wall references? We already have three narrators so what purpose did the snippets from Janie's point of view serve? They actually confused me more at first, until I realized what had happened. Also, it had a sort of depressing tone. BUT, I thought about it a lot. It occupied my mind for the entire two weeks I read it and that's always a good thing to me.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|It was a good movie.  I really thought it would be scarier than it is!  They hype it up as to how scary it is and then you watch it and it's not as scary as you expect!  That was the only disappointment.  But it was good!
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I thought this would be a creepy book. Just look at the cover. Let me tell you, it's not. It started off interesting and just got duller as the book went on. Nothing scary or haunting happens. It's basically a story of misfits. Like I haven't heard that before. I didn't hate it but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|The movie is honest about the devastating effects of substance abuse and addiction.  An excellent wake up call. Thank you
B0017SWPXY|4.0|You can't help but love Enzo. This story is written in the perspective of Enzo, a dog and, like most dogs, Enzo is SO loyal to his owner. That complete devotion is magical and engaging. I was really intrigued because I always wonder how much my dogs understand. It's not happy-go-lucky though for sure and I did cry, so a warning to all the emotional ones out there.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found this book of Hosseini's rather disjointed. Don't read it electronically or you are sure to get lost.<br />Many characters jumping in and out if the story. Interesting story which includes many subplots. Seemed I just got interested in one line and off he went to the next plot!  Not my favorite read but certainly not my worst!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Awesome set. Love watching Sons of Anarchy. Was a delightful surprize for my husband. he loved it. Watches it over and over and over......  lol
B000J233SK|5.0|I absolutely am in love with this CD!! It is so soothing and she has an amazing voice, highly recommended.
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Took me 4 years of talking to my husband to figure out what movie he was talking about. he loves this movie. One of his alltime favorites. Watches it over and over and over....... lol  Was definitely worth the wait :)
006202406X|1.0|Biggest disappointment ever.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />It is not even due to the fact that Tris died... This book was just plain awful. This series was shaping up to be one of my favorites of all time.... And then this happened. It's like it wasn't even the same author writing it! It seemed incredibly lazy and not thought out. Way to ruin an entire series. You killed the series with this book.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Awesome classic horror film. Loved watching it again. Some parts I hadnt remembered, but still a good movie. Remakes arent as good as Sissy Spasek version :)
B00APAENUI|4.0|This book is a good read, but could have been much, much better with a decent editor.  I deducted one star, a 20% deduction.  That is approximately equal to the amount of useless dialog I skimmed.  People who enjoy political intrigue may have found those intricately documented conversations worth reading, I did not.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|Thrill seekers unite.  Was awesome to watch, it's a classic for sure! loved it. Never gets too old to watch

1580084621|5.0|Since I bought this book, I can tell what Thai restaurants have skimped or cut corners on, or if they are really honest and fresh with their spices and herbs.  After trying a few simple recipes, and adjusting them for my level of heat and sweetness, I can make anything!  This book is impressive, historical, and eye opening.  You can really learn about the Thai culture through what time and effort they put into their food.  One thing you need is a close proximity to a good Asian market or you may be frustrated with the ingredients you need and don't have.  Be sure to get a mortar and pestle before you invest in this book.  I was up at 7:30 in the morning pounding curries for the first month I owned this book. Good luck!

0062107313|5.0|After an absence of four years, Amy Tan is back with a new and provocative novel guaranteed to cause ripples among critics and readers alike. Tan’s books often deal with mother-daughter relationships, tapping her Chinese-American roots for the familial complexities that arise in the culture clash of East and West. It comes as no surprise that the underlying theme of THE VALLEY OF AMAZEMENT addresses these differences, but Lucia and Violet are unlike any mother and daughter we’ve met in Tan’s work and perhaps anywhere else. The action takes place at the turn of the 20th century in San Francisco and Shanghai during and after the fall of the Qing Dynasty.<br /><br />We first meet Violet at age seven living with her American-born mother, Lucia Minturn, the madam of Hidden Jade Path, a first-class courtesan house in Shanghai. Lucia left San Francisco at age 17 to follow the Chinese artist who fathered her unborn child. The promise of marriage and life in a prestigious Chinese family collapses as a thousand years of Chinese culture intervene, and Lucia is left to raise Violet on her own. Violet’s Caucasian features do not hint of her Chinese ancestry, and she is raised and educated as an American. With the aid of a friend, Lucia opens a tea house that evolves into Hidden Jade Path, and Violet has been carefully sheltered from her mother’s profession. Lucia is tricked into leaving behind her daughter, who is now 14, and the adventures of Violet, the Virgin Courtesan, begin.<br /><br />The back story on how THE VALLEY OF AMAZEMENT came about is almost as provocative as the novel itself. Tan had been researching the time period at the end of the Qing Dynasty when a thousand years of imperialism came to an abrupt halt. Always in touch with women’s issues, she wanted to explore the plight of women who had been treated as chattel for centuries when they were confronted with a whole new world. It was during her research for this historical novel that she came acrossa photo of “The Ten Beauties of Shanghai.” They were courtesans (beauties was a euphemism for the oldest profession in the world) who had won a popularity contest in Shanghai. In the photograph is a woman who closely resembles a picture of her own grandmother, whose past has remained a mystery. Her elaborate clothing and jewelry were commonly worn only by courtesans.<br /><br />From that revelation came the inspiration for the book. Thus beganan eight-year journey that took Tan to museums, libraries, art historians and scholars on the courtesan life. She polished up her rudimentary Chinese and traveled deep into the remote interior for the chapters on life in Moon Pond, an important element of the story.<br /><br />Do you recall the sensational reaction to PEYTON PLACE and FANNY HILL? Move over Grace Metalious and John Cleland. Those books would no longer be the eye-poppers they were in the mid-20th century with today’s penchant for anything goes, but THE VALLEY OF AMAZEMENTdeftly treats the subject with class and élan. The chapter titled “Etiquette for Beauties of the Boudoir”instructs the newcomer to Hidden Jade Path on how to build a clientele by creating illusions of love. The delicate euphemisms for body parts and positions, derived from extensive historical research on Tan’s part, are as imaginative and amusing as might be expected from a novelist with Tan’s customary and often witty approach to delicate subjects.<br /><br />Tan jokingly refers to the book as “Fifty Shades of Tan.”Her one concern is that it might be thought to glamorize prostitution. The tragic lives of these unfortunate women may have seemed glamorous until the cruel reality set in. She says she “believes that sexual slavery is one of the biggest problems facing the world today.”<br /><br />Are Amy Tan fans ready to travel to THE VALLEY OF AMAZEMENT? It will be interesting to watch the results. Bon voyage, armchair travelers.<br /><br />-Roz Shea

0316074314|4.0|When Eleanor Catton was short-listed for the 2013 Man Booker Prize, it was a triumph for this young New Zealand-based author. Her first novel, THE REHEARSAL, was written when she was only 22 years old and was also short-listed for various book awards.<br /><br />Now, at the wizened old age of 28, Catton has officially become the youngest person ever to win the Man Booker Prize, which has been in existence for over 40 years. She now proudly follows in the tradition of prior winners like William Golding, Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Hillary Mantel. The praise that Catton has received is well deserved. She not only has created a memorable work of literary fiction with THE LUMINARIES, she has done so with an 800-plus-page read that is packed with stunning atmosphere and complex characters. The year is 1866, and the setting is a small New Zealand town called Hokitika.<br /><br />Walter Moody is an Englishman and literal gold-digger who drags his weary body into the bar/smoking room of the Crown Hotel in Hokitika. Seeking to make his fortune and in need of guidance on the local territory, he enters a room filled with 12 men. Normally it would not be an uncommon occurrence save for the fact that it is quite evident to him that these individuals were in the middle of something highly secretive.<br /><br />Moody is joined at his table by one of the men, a local named Thomas Balfour. Balfour’s presence breaks some of the obvious tension that fills the room, and he is a quite pleasant fellow. After learning of Moody’s intentions as a fortune seeker who has come to New Zealand’s goldfields, Balfour begins to share some information with him. This comes in the form of tales, and he is soon joined by the other members of the group as the stories begin to spin on and on.<br /><br />It turns out that the men are part of a counsel of sorts, and their gathering is intended to discuss a series of mysterious events that have befallen their usually quiet town. A wealthy manhas vanished, a prostitute has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. As Moody is drawn into these various storylines and mysteries, he cannot help but get involved. Unfortunately, he will soon realize that he has bit off much more than he can chew. He will also come to find that his appearance may have been pre-ordained, and his involvement in all of these local mysteries may be far deeper than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Above all, Eleanor Catton needs to be praised for the fact that she is able to sustain interest and intrigue for 800+ pages. The writing will hark back to classic storytelling styles like Dickens and Austen. The location she has created seems to exist in a world of its own and comes across like a “Twin Peaks” sort of town, where each and every resident are not what they seem to be, and all have stories and backgrounds that are vital to the plot. THE LUMINARIES is an engaging novel that adventurous and patient readers will surely enjoy.<br /><br />-Ray Palen
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great, easy setup etc. I watch streamed shows from NBC, etc. via Chrome browser to TV and it works great. Would like more apps that support it (Amazon, etc). Watching Netflix / Web Videos on 60&#34; plasma come out perfect. Can't beat the price for what it does.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Awesome movie! I rented this for my family and they loved it.  They said it was so much better than the previous movies.  I watched it later and have to agree with them.  The only thing about this movie that bothered me was Zod's acting.  He came across as if he was trying TOO hard to play the part.  Otherwise, I am recommending this movie to all of my friends.  I think I'll watch it a second time as well.  It was just that good.

B0001ARCFA|3.0|When I bought this product I was expecting a lot from it as I have Harman/Kardon laptop speakers (AKG is a Harman company) which are absolutely amazing when it comes to sound quality. I bought this intending on buying a pair of headphones that would be able to provide good amounts of bass without compromising sound quality, but this didn't do that at all. When I 1st listened to them it sounded like the bass was replaced with treble, it was an indescribable experience and was horrible. As I burned it in for an hour it sounded much better in terms of sound quality, but there was very little bass. The overall sound quality was actually less than that of my laptop's speakers believe it or not, which makes these only worth about $60 at most. The build quality was a bit sketchy which is surprising having seen how they make these on How It's Made. If you're looking for cheap headphones with good sound quality these may do it for you, but you can find better elsewhere.

B008Y6S4XM|5.0|Excellent Sci Fi In Space Flick. Had Great Action And Loved Guy Pearce's<br />Way Of Looking At Things, Just Plain Excellent Movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|As the mother of a Lego and Minecraft lover (same kid) I wish they had more Lego Minecraft sets. He said this one was a little much, the pieces are incredibly small, and numerous.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  And I am so excited I can finally play on my kindle!!!  bigger screen = even more fun
B009EEEW7A|5.0|Adrien Brody Is One Of My Favorite Actors.<br />Loved Him In The Jacket. He's Such An Excellent Actor<br />And Was A Natural For Predators
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I was not going to watch this movie but my 2 year old nephew was over and kept talking about the movie. I ordered it and sat to watch it with him. The movie was so engaging that my 15 year old son and my best friend who does not even have kids, sat to watch the movie with us. The movie has an endearing story that is filled with humor and family friendly fun good for any age. The colors and the vision of the movie was definitely eye catching. I enjoyed this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|keeps me on my toes!!!!!!  LOL!!!!!!  love the graphics and variety!!!  Needs to have more levels!!!  Keep those levels coming !!!
B001BANK32|5.0|I've read this book twice and it's just as brilliantly creepy the second time around!  Years before I actually read Stephen King, I assumed he was just a mainstream horror writer.  He's become one of my absolute favorite horror story authors.  Each book has it's own charm, I love it :)
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show and best story telling I have seen in a long time! Will watch it again and again!<br /><br />Screw rating stuff on amazon! They make you type more than you want to! AMAZON! Don't ask me to rate anything any more!
B000002GXX|5.0|One of These Nights includes a number of fabulous tracks that are cleverly featured in the Eagles' current documentary 'History of the Eagles' including 'Too Many Hands', 'After the Thrill is Gone' and Randy Meisner's 'Take It to the Limit', which Glenn Frey now sings for millions of Eagles fans during their current concert tour (that I just got to see 2 nights ago in 2nd row in Tenn ~ I came out from Los Angeles so I could see them live).  One of the most perfected songs of all time 'Lyin' Eyes' is on here and reminds me of my old stomping grounds Dan Tana's, the Troub, the Bow and more in West Hollywood... The title track is one of the most haunting songs ever... Denise Ames, Los Angeles
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad Amazon brought the game to kindle fire....  Had it on my phone fist and and now on my kindle.  LOVE IT.....
B000002GVO|5.0|Obviously a landmark release, Hotel California comes with many of the Eagles best songs of all time including mine: 'Try and Love Again' by the great Randy Meisner.  Joe Walsh's gorgeous 'Pretty Maids All in a Row' is included in their current live concert tour, of which I got to attend 2 nights ago sitting in 2nd row in Tenn (came in from Los Angeles just to see them).  Grammy-winning 'New Kid in Town', the rockin' 'Victim of Love' and 'Life in the Fast Lane' are also here as is the poignant 'Wasted Time' (the sad 'yacht song' in the 'History of the Eagles' documentary) and of course the title track, which is also Brilliantly featured in the doc as the only song played in it's entirety during the film.  Hotel California is a complete reminder of my days being raised in San Diego.  Denise Ames, Los Angeles
B0015T7Q98|4.0|This is probably my favorite all around album from Panic!at the Disco. I like their other's as well, but I think this is the only one that I love all the songs' in.<br /><br />If your looking for a truly alternative rock, with some folk mixed in for good measure, definitely give this album a try.
B000002GYW|5.0|Oh...Desperado by far my favorite release from the Eagles (though I adore them all).  Considered a 'bomb' according to Glenn Frey himself in the fantastic documentary 'History of the Eagles', I can't imagine a world without these stunning masterpieces.  I got to see them live 2 nights ago in the 2nd row in Tenn (I flew out there from Los Angeles JUST to see them) and thankfully they showered the crowd with tracks from their sophomore release, including opening their show with the lovely 'Saturday Night', followed shortly after with my Favorites 'Doolin-Dalton' and a Stunning Reprise of 'D-D/Desperado', with the imcomparable 'Tequila Sunrise' sandwiched in between ~ Absolutely Sensational.  Randy Meisner's 'Certain Kind of Fool' is a fantastic track and thank goodness, featured in their doc 'History of the Eagles'.  My Absolute Favorite is Glenn Frey's 'Outlaw Man' (the lyrics are a lot the way I actually think and am, the composition is genius).  Then there's the legendary 'Desperado' which is, rightfully so, their last encore performed on their current tour.<br />Denise Ames, Los Angeles
B004K0C80G|5.0|Good movie! Great inspiration and insight to how indigenous people are treated - all over the world. I liked it.
B000002GYN|5.0|The Eagles phenomenal debut album contains exquisite material including Randy Meisner's 'Tryin' (sung by Glenn Frey in the doc 'History of the Eagles' at The Gallery in Aspen) and the gorgeous 'Train Leaves Here This Morning' co-written by Bernie Leadon prior to joining the Eagles and performed to PERFECTION on their current concert tour, of which I was priveledged to see in the 2nd row 2 nights ago in Tenn!! (I flew from my home in Los Angeles JUST to see them).  Other tracks they are currently performing live are 'Witchy Woman', and of course, 'Peaceful Easy Feeling' (written by Frey's friend Jack Tempchin, who I was lucky enough to interview for my celeb column in a Burbank, Ca newspaper recently) and 'Take It Easy'.  Other faves on this release are 'Earlybird', 'Chug All Night' and the gorgeous 'Nightingale', which are all also featured in the doc.  I can't imagine not having this CD...Denise Ames, Los Angeles
B00F6Y3FKW|4.0|For some rediculas reason they don't want to release \\"time out of mind \\" on vinyl.its total bs.bring this out on vinyl or no money from me,grrrr
B00D2JDNQ4|2.0|The storyline is illogical and telling the story twice in different ways is boring with an ending that leaves much open and is an anti-climax
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|this game is very fun because there is more then one way to go and does not freeze on me also you can buy guns and armour. BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|You could quibble with any masterpiece.  Yes, maybe it's a little too long but from Donna Tartt every word is a gift, as far as I'm concerned.  For some, this book could be a life-changing experience.  It is more real than life itself, surreal at times.  As everyone says, though, it is grounded in the great classics, especially Dickens' novels and out of all his wonderful output, it reminded me most of David Copperfield.  Theo Decker lives for me and I really hope his dreams comes true at long last.  Donna, a sequel, PLEASE.  NOW !!!
B0037LK3R4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, although I'm still undecided about how I feel about Chris. Part of me, all of us I think, are so tempted to leave it all behind. He was obviously troubled by parts of his life. Then, he seems to have died at peace. It makes me sad to think his life could have been saved had he walked along the river when he found it too high to swim, or didn't eat moldy seeds. I do admire his drive and ambition. It does appear he was ready to rejoin the world, and I wish he could have. He was loved and touched a lot of lives. Parts of me do agree with those who say he should have spent much more time researching. I don't agree with those who thought he was crazy, but I suppose we'll never really know. Such a sad end to a life with so much promise. I hope his story reaches those who have the same feeling, and maybe they'll reexamine what their purpose in life is. Into the Wild is worth the read, but it'll leave you feeling a little sad and with a lot of lingering questions that will never be answered.
B0089LOG02|3.0|This story was disappointing. I knew nothing about the orphan trains, and was looking forward to a fascinating read. Although this story started well, it didn't reveal near enough about the orphan system itself. The ending was predictable and a little too neat.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Best movie I saw all summer. Typical B movie plot BUT GOLLLY THE REST OF THE MOVIE WILL BLOW YOU AWAY. Well it blew me away. (If you live in WA or CO you already know what to do before you watch this)
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|A tedious, predictable read. After reading the rave reviews for this book, it was my recommendation for my book club. I'm embarrassed. I found the characters shallow and self-absorbed. The author forces the theme of how well do we know our closest companions down the reader's throat. I would never recommend this book nor will I ever read another novel by this author.
B0000013GT|5.0|BEST OUTKAST PROJECT. NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. All the beats must have been a real trip back in the day. Literally nothing else captures their unique sound.<br /><br />If for some weird reason you haven't checked this out, give Mainstream, Millennium, ATLiens, Elevators and Wailin a peep. All audio dope.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Actually liked Season 1 a little better, but this is still entertaining.  What we noticed unfortunately was the excessive use of &#34;God d**n&#34; over and over and over in some episodes.  So much so that it really becomes annoying.  The show and character development is done so well that it is sad that they seem to feel the need for the &#34;cursing&#34; to add what? Credibility? We find it so overused that the character sounds silly.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|If you've given tylers other projects a listen you should have an idea of what to expect.......AT LEAST THATS WHAT I THOUGHT AFTER A FIRST LISTEN. THIS REALLY GROWS ON YOU. This is easily tyler's best project. The beats are simply nutty. The features are a good highlight too. HE GOT THE GODESS BADU ON THIS??? HE GOT SKATEBOARD P ON THIS??? OOOOOWEEEE<br /><br />If you haven't given this a listen DEFINITELY GIVE TREEHOME95 a listen. most beautuful song ive heard from tyler. NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS SONG.<br />Rusty, slater, jamba and parking lot all dope too.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|one of the most talented soulful emotion filled artists of all times!! I absolutely love this band!! Looking forward to new music from them!!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Best Quentin movie in recent memory. Hell, its actually one of my favorites right up there with Resevior dogs, pulp fiction, and jackie brown. If you a western fan give this a peep, you wont be disappointed!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again, John Grisham has written a book that is hard to put down. It is so relevant for anyone who has experienced a settlement of a deceased loved one. Thanks for good reading!
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|lol............................................ cannot unhear this<br /><br />Defiantly kanye's weakest project next next to WTT.<br />Blood on the leaves only cool song. good sample.<br /><br />2/5 because that parkinsons line
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The game play is great and straight forward but I've caught a few computer cheating moments were there are no cards in the PC hand yet they play the next card anyway.
B0000029GA|5.0|IT AINT HARD TO TELL WHY NAS EXCEL.<br /><br />If for some BIZZARE reason you havent gave this a listen, Memory Lane and Halftime are the best
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is one of my favorite authors so choosing this book was based a great deal on that.  Also, the setting was same as in A Time To Kill which I loved.  Several of the characters were brought forth in Sycamore Row and found myself picturing them as the actors who played them in the movie version of A Time To Kill which, for me, enhanced my reading.  That being said, I thought the storyline was very good and the pace of the book excellent.  The only time it was a little tedious was during the trial with medical testimony but this was necessary for the story.  Overall, whether you're a die-hard Grisham fan or not...this book is a great read and I highly recommend it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Don't get all the hate over this move? Good visuals, good character casting, and better than usual superman story. MICHEAL SHANNON FTW<br /><br />(IF YOU LOOK REAAAL CLOSE YOU CAN SEE KEVIN SPACEY IN THE INTRO SCENE)
B00F0N7JUG|3.0|the packing is stupid as the product does not fit on shelves.just ship in standard blu ray  cases. don't include a toy or thing.
B005LAII80|5.0|Action fan, sci-fi fan, comic fan you say? Wellllll then give this a watch. SUCH A DOPE MOVIE. Urban was made to play this part. The story was very dredd, the cast was very well uhhh.....cast, the shoot out scenes are insane, and the slo-mo scenes are a trip. Very pleased. I hope they made enough to want a sequel.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books I have read in recent years.  What made this book good for me is that the technology is all plausible, it is just jacked up and implemented in a way that allows the author to explore the social and political implications of a self-aware platform and how it might react after becoming self aware.<br /><br />Think XBox Live Platform becoming self aware and interacting with the XBox user community to reach out an &#34;control&#34; the physical world through de facto agents.<br /><br />Definitely read it!
B004LFO0ME|2.0|THIS IS WHERE WIZ TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORST. ITS LIKE HE STEPPED ON OUR FINGERS ON THE WAY TO THE TOP AND DIDNT APOLOGIZE.<br /><br />Fly Solo and rooftops only decent songs off this project.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Great game for FAOTD. The tutorial is about 3 pages and straight to the point which I like. Also very easy game play. You do have to think some. So far only on the easy but it's all logic and no guessing.<br />Overall great app, nice graphics. Definitely recommend today
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a science fiction classic that does not get old. The youngsters in this book are described in a way that shows us older people the point of view that we should remember. The story itself is a space opera which does not forget the human aspect. It tells us how important it is to see beyond obvious enemy lines and find humanity where we did not see it initially.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Typical Grisham. Cĺean  with no offensive language or situations, good plot, but slow moving in parts. The  courtroom part is riviting.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Once again Denzel Washington has proven his ability to perform with perfection. Along with Mr. Washington's co-stars this movie was exciting and engaging from beginning to end.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great graphics!  I installed this and checked it out a bit, enough to know that it's very, very cool!  I uninstalled it temporarily to finish The Amazing Spiderman game.  When I'm done, I'll uninstall &#34;The Amazing Spiderman&#34; and play this through.
B0044LK8J4|5.0|Love Pink Martini!  The sound from track to track is varied and ear-appealing, and I<br />Listen to their music quite often.
B00DP8XSQ2|4.0|Love it!  The music that comes on automatically when you start the application is a bit annoying, but other than that it lets me go out on my deck, Kindle Fire in hand, and helps me identify the various objects in the sky.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I'd consider this pretty much a standard app to download when you get a Kindle. Nice simple interface, good forecast, pretty accurate. Only thing that confuses me is the mPoints. Seems scammy. No effect  on the quality of the app though, easily ignored.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|Always a great read.  He was such a wise man.  Reading his words I think that he would fit in with contemporary society just fine.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun! Not so hard that you get frustrated and quit, just challenging enough to keep your brain working.  Great app, hope more rooms come soon!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I'm playing this one now.  It's pretty cool.  Great graphics and easy to get around once you get used to it.  The only games I had on the Kindle Fire was Sudoku, and Chess.  When I saw this I had to try it, and so far I'm glad I did.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it's so interesting and you get to actuAlly breed the dragons! I'm actually obsessed haha :)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it, makes it easier to keep up on Facebook, love the set up a ease of use. Better than on iPods because of the size of the kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|PEOPLE there can't be a lot of things in pe addition like there is on pc and Xbox because the kindle and 'll ios devices have a limited amount of space like unlimited world (actually isn't unlimited it's 8 million blocks across and wide about the size of Neptune fun fact) generation or redstone  or different dimensions. They will probably not put that in, there efficiently not gonna put in 8 million block words if the Xbox is only a mere thousands of blocks so don't expect the big stuff were just lucky to have minecraft on devices.
B00EY7MFKS|3.0|horrible tv actors immediately killed any excitement I had for this. fortunately Jackson stepped in just in time to save the day and the series. I will check out season 2
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This series was my favorite when I was a kid and I still love them even though I'm an adult.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington's acting was absolutely superb!!  I enjoyed it's depiction of the human condition and decisions that affect one's life.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Stryper gets better with age.  God turned water into wine with these guys.  I have been listening to Stryper since I was in college in the 80s.  Soldiers Under Command is still my favorite, but I love today's blend of metal and rock.  I hear even echoes of Megadeath, and overtones of Alice in Chains in some of these songs.  I've seen Michael on That Metal Show, and totally agree... ...put out good music and reach everyone!  I do not listen to the Contemporary Christian Genre Music Stations, because I am a rock and metal fan.  Stryper is in my music library along with Mr. Mustaine, , Boston (of course), AC/DC, Whitesnake, Sebastian, Metallica, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Styx, Scorpions, KISS...you get the picture.  Other than the TRUTH in their lyrics, Michael still has the voice!!!!  I am really glad the original 4 are still together.  This masterpiece features Robert, Oz, and Tim at various points in concert-like fashion to give Michael's pipes a rest.<br /><br />-Revelation: Classic Stryper (leans Rock)<br />-No More Hell to Pay: Classic Stryper (leans Rock)<br />-Saved by Love: Classic Stryper<br />-Jesus is Alright: Classic Stryper (love the bridge...departure from classic Stryper venturing into a little jazz, but it works for me)<br />-The One: Classic Stryper<br />-Legacy: Classic Stryper (By far my favorite track!!!  This brings out the Megadeath fan in me...some Skid Row also)<br />-Marching into Battle: Classic Stryper (ready for Rev 19...I plan to be following the ONE on the white horse)<br />-Te Amo: our friends to the South will love this one!  Classic Stryper with a Spanish Chorus<br />-Sticks and Stones: Classic Stryper (Alice in Chains influence...the Rooster would respect this one)<br />-Water into Wine: Classic Stryper (leans Rock)<br />-Sympathy: Classic Stryper (Queensryche fans will like it)<br />-Renewed: Classic Stryper<br /><br />I want more Stryper.  Looking forward to the next release...
B009LDD1X0|4.0|It said that it would be here the 15th i order it on the 13th ( this is why i order it) and it is not here ... And i tracked the package it said the 16th .... In the other hand i love this show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is really fun it's one of the best games I have played  I love this game thank you
B003QS9TKU|5.0|A childhood favourite I have often thought of, I am enchanted with 'Under the Sea'. I was so glad to see this film on cable TV here in Australia, I adore it - it is the perfect, magical movie, all children should see it and be enchanted.<br /><br />Angela Landsbury is am impressive actor.
0767817486|5.0|This is a true movie and keeps you glued to every scene.  It also shows a person that they should never attempt to break their laws because a prison in Turkey and some other countries is far worse than anyone can imagine.  Wonderful acting and a movie you will want to watch many times.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love to hate this game! I blame my family for making me addicted!  Best game out to drive you nuts!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|I was not going to read this book after some of the reviews I read, but then decided to make my own decision.  I should have listened, it wasn't the worst I've ever read, but there were many flaws in the story line.  I will not go into detail so to avoid spoilers (I don't appreciate review that give away the story).  Enough to say it is geared to a younger audience. I have not decided if I will bother with the rest of the books.  Maybe if I get desperate for something to read.
B00F031XPS|4.0|Was great to  watch on PBS. Very well done. Same goes for the Blu-Ray. Nice to see the unreleased Randalls Island and Isle  of Fehmarn footage even though they were not the best of his shows. The Miami footage shows Jimi at the top of his game. A must view for even the most ardent Hendrix fan and even those with just a passing interest. Now lets get Atlanta  and Royal Albert Hall released and there will alot of happy campers out there
1933865474|5.0|Fantastic artistic with solid line skill. Varied selection of images. A great art book. Bruce Timm is able to capture motion and character with great precision. Fantastic book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked the characters in the book. It would make a good made for TV movie that plays like a soap opera.<br />It does make you think about how you path in life can change if secrets came out.
B00FEN58KA|5.0|the doll is beautiful and great size. I bought it for my daughter, and she really loved it. Its the perfect size and the doll's dress is beautiful.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Smart, sexy, great dialogue, interesting characters -- all this adds up to a great TV show to look forward to each week,  I missed a couple of episodes last season  and waited anxiously for Amazon to offer it; did a Good Wife marathon.
B00GIZO674|5.0|Great game they should add more to the game :) only thing I hate is that we have to buy something EVERYTIME we pass
B0040I09RM|5.0|Best TV series ever.....very exciting and addictive.  Interesting chsracters...fsst paced....love this show..the bikes..I hope it many more seasons to run.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love watching the dress and hair styles of that period.  The show depicts the rapid changes of the early 1900's and the story lines are engaging.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle and android phone.  I also have it on my work iPad.  I log in on any device and it's all synched up and I can take up where I left off.  I love using the plans for my reading or devotions.  I have several versions downloaded on my Kindle, so no worries if I'm someplace with no wireless.  Wouldn't want to be without it.
0399160450|5.0|Excellent, intense book. Describes in detail what might happen in realistic and plausible terms. Especially good for those that are knowledgeable with computers. Intense and thrilling.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nice to go back to old characters, with a new story, that kept you guessing until the end. Hope we can re-visit this characters again
B009HEMJCW|5.0|Really loved the movie (: it was awesome most of the movies rock in amazon I recommend it too everyone.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I can't even begin to say how much I enjoyed this book. The main character Theo was so fully developed I actually thought about him and his welfare when I wasn't reading the book. Not only did the author dig deep into all the characters but she showed you how layered and complicated they were, resulting in a sensitivity and empathy to every character introduced. Donna Tartt weaves such a contemporary New York tale full of suspense in a intelligent and meaningful way - I couldn't out this book down and was sad to see it end.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It felt like the book was written by a different author. Myself and 3 other people I know who loved the first two books, divergent and insurgent felt that this one isa disappointment. Most of the story was draggy and lazy and fell superbly short of all expectations for an ending to the trilogy.
1556347308|5.0|Goes incredibly well the the GURPS Basics Characters book which refers to this edition frequently.  Helps to clarify rules, game mechanics and management.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|A few holes and oddities (like why didn't he just tell his partner what was up...... would have saved a lot of trouble, lol) but still great. This is one I wish they would remake if they could do it right.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This was good for being a free game. One con was it took a long time to download the needed files. But it is entertaining and still lets you have fun without spending money to advance in the game.
B003THJA1G|5.0|EXCELLENT series...great detective mystery without being gorey. Fleeting references to series \\"Firefly\\" fun to catch! Family friendly series that is addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Soooo fun! SOOOO Addictive! I would have given Five stars if it didn't have the TIMED LEVELS! AND, it wouldn't hurt to reward you with special candies or &quot;Helpers&quot; when You level up!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I absolutely love this.  It has many sounds to choose and lets you overlay sounds, like start with wind, then add thunder, and maybe add chimes.  All play at the same time.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|no where NEAR easy to use!!!  i wasn't able to cut one bottle with this.  i'd rather use a saw and hack the bottle up.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's just like going on a hunt can let my mom play she likes this yap good job Love it fun
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this app!!Just start playing this and it is crazy fun<br />.I would play all the time if I could!
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|It was ok. Pretty heavy handed in some parts, kinda dumb in parts, kinda fun in parts. Just about what you would expect from something like this. Low commitment; no intellect required. Relied heavily on special effects to keep the audience engaged.<br /><br />I think this is about $1 worth of entertainment, $2 tops. Wait until it's cheaper, and you will feel like you got a decent deal. If you are offended by over-the-top political activism/opinions disguised as action movies, I would advise against watching this.<br /><br />Also, would somebody please tell the directors of these films to stop having the characters jack a shell into the chamber of their gun every time they want to make a point or punchline? The tour guide did it twice in 5 minutes with the shotgun. It's so old! Please don't make me beg!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Easy to download and use. It is fun to play.<br />It makes the time go by fast if you are waiting for service or at a doctors office.
B00DJUPLY8|2.0|I could not figure out how to use it.<br />I ran into dead ends on what to enter, there are not any instructions on how to use it that I could find.<br />I removed it from my Kindle.
0812550706|5.0|Perfect condition. Love the story - I wanted to re-read it before the movie came out. It's a perfect story.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|it is the BEST show on television currently running...period. The characters are so well portrayed and the writing is wonderful.  The director is brilliant.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I took a trip 2 weeks ago and added a 2nd location. Now the vacation location is the default, I can't delete it, &amp; I got tired of changing my location every time I want to check the weather.<br /><br />I felt relieved when I removed the app from my kindle!
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This entertaining look at the summer of 1927 is, quite possibly, a top 3 book for me this year.<br /><br />I understand that Bryson books typically have a lot of humor. While this one is a breezy look at America during the summer of 1927 and he included an occasional amusing, insightful fact or two about famous people of the time, it wasn't what I would call humorous.<br /><br />What it is was a fascinating look at the events, both big and small, of the summer of 1927. Of course, Charles Lindbergh and his trans-Atlantic flight tops the list, as does Babe Ruth and his summer of 60 home runs. Sacco and Vanzetti. Al Capone. Prohibition. All the people and events you'd expect, but even then, Bryson manages to find an impart interesting, little-known facts about these people and events.<br /><br />Besides Lindbergh and the Babe, there are lesser-known people, too, such as the man who specialized in carrying out executions via the electric chair. Who knew that the condemned were fitted in leather football helmets, so that they resembled Red Grange. Or the woman who first thought up going after mobsters for unpaid taxes.<br /><br />Fascinating book, one I'd highly recommend. All history books should be this good!!
0399255370|5.0|I ordered this book because Amazon told me that I might like it- and boy were they RIGHT!! I am an elementary school administrator and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book to my first grade classes. The illustrations are beautiful and the humor is right on target. It is not often you find a book that both children and adults can enjoy together. I can't wait for another book from Drew Daywalt!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game, easy to play if you've ever played Spider Solitaire.  A better game than what I have on my PC or my iMac.
0811879542|5.0|This book is so fun and interactive. I am an elementary school administrator and I have had such a great time sharing this with my Kindergarten classes- they really think the book is MAGIC!! I tell them books are so much more fun when you can share them with friends and with this book that is so true- not near as fun to read alone. Thanks Herve Tullet for giving us such a wonderful book to share!
B009MYARIK|4.0|Cute story and well written. Typical Sophie Kinsella story. Worth the time reading. Will put a smile on your face.
B00F3VOL38|4.0|I just had to buy this, after growing up under the Beatle's tutelage in the 1960's. Disappointing in that most of the music sounds just like the records, that annoying Bryan Matthews and his inane comments about the boys, most of the comments are instantly forgettable, nut the good news is that it is nice to have the music.<br /><br />It is irksome in a way that we can have the safe old recordings from the early sixties yet we cannot have, the warts and all, creative music of the late sixties because someone is holding out on the Let It Be sessions and DVD, even though the tapes are alive and well somewhere.<br /><br />Listening to this took me on a big nostalgia trip about Britain in the sixties, about Rediffusion, Janice and I'll give it 5, Bryan Matthews and the other old fogies who tried to be hip.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|This young duo has been at the top for multitudes, even here in the USA.  My husband and I are senior citizens, and<br />adore good music, from jazz to classical.  I saw the audition of Jonathan and Charlotte, and absolutely fell in love<br />with them.  My husband is bedridden and enjoys listening to their spectacular voices.  Thanks to BGT and other<br />Brits who gave this duo a boost.  We are going to fill each Christmas stocking with one of their CD's.  VOILA! CIAO!

Never any issues with the app and the graphics are nice. It's my ne  favorite matching game. The best part: there are 3 levels of difficulty and no annoying lives to find/buy or waiting for the next &#34;episode&#34;. Plus candy rots teeth so be cute, eat fruit!!! And GET THIS APP!! The only thing I don't like is after the level ends, fruit is still cascading and I would like to see those points added to my score... :(  :( :(
0061950726|5.0|I liked this book so much that not  only did I buy an electronic version, but a hard copy as well to share with friends/relatives who don't have an e-reader. The book is well-written and explores a time in history not too many people know about. I loved the intertwining lives of Molly and Vivian, two strong, resilient women with similar life experiences, though years apart. I took away a comparison of the orphan train to today's foster care system. In some ways, they are so similar. A great read!

B003XU02QG|5.0|I almost didn't watch this film, because of some of the reviews. Then, I almost turned it off, because it was yet another story of the 9th Roman Legion. I thought, &#34;Why is every Roman movie about the 9th, these days?&#34; I held on, and I'm glad I did. Thinking of the critical reviews, I can't imagine what they want in a movie. This has everything, and unlike most films about a tragic event, it both begins and ends well. Having first hand knowledge of the U.S. Army now, I can't certainly relate to the ending. The story surrounds not just an honorable soldier, but an honorable man, something top brass boast about, but rarely appreciate. An outpost is destroyed, and the 9th is called out to crush the rebels of the Northern English Isle once and for all. Led by a rebel tracker, the 9th Legion was brought to an ambush. The story is about the character of the men who survive that ambush, and their fight to get back home. This film shows both sides of the coin, and is relevant to any conduct of war. Brutal death is a consequence of war, but rape and pillage tactics breed more and stronger enemies, something no civilization has, or may ever realize. Honor and integrity belong everywhere, especially war, and is not a weakness, but a strength. This movie reminds us of that. Well acted, and directed. There is a good mix of scenery, action, dialog, and music. I'm not sure what else you'd want in a movie. This one is a buy to add to my movie collection.

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Dust is terrific - simple as that. For long time fans of Patricia Cornwell, this book is a long awaited link in the chain of the characters' shared history, told beautifully and filled with suspense.  If you've never read one of her masterpieces, this is a good place to start, although I always love going back to where it all began - Postmortem. The series continues to grow and evolve in real life ways, and Cornwell once again takes us to places that we otherwise couldn't even imagine -- I was impressed with the way she showed us what Scarpetta dealt with after a national tragedy, which is unfortunately becoming more and not less common in the world. Brava to her for incorporating a real life event with courage, taste and empathy; while we are never transported to the actual event, we get images of what Kay saw and how she handled it, which was really quite moving.<br /><br />A great read, fast moving and suspenseful. Don't hesitate - Kudos to Patricia Cornwell for another fantastic book. The only problem is having to wait another year for the next one.

B00AW28HF6|3.0|Tsunami Connection is a political thriller with numerous plot lines running in parallel to each other. The stories are set in various locales throughout the world with Kefira, a Colonel in the Mossad and her cohorts as the connecting thread. Galagher provides some unique concepts such as \\"cloaking,\\" the ability for personnel and equipment to be present, but unseen, albeit with some interesting glitches.<br /><br />Kefira is one of a group of orphans who were picked up and trained for special forces work in the Mossad; destined to be placed, imperceptibly, anywhere the Mossad needed clandestine operatives.<br /><br />The Russians have created a weapon that, from a submarine resting on the sea bed, causes tsunami's to rush to chosen areas, causing death and destruction. It could be used for the purposes of genocide. Kefira, and the other Mossad operatives, including her love interest, Zak are sent on a mission to defuse the situation.<br /><br />Add into the mix that Kefira's \\"control\\", a General in the Mossad and and Zak's mentor, who holds a similar position, are at odds ends and embroiled in a completion to see who's prot&eacute;g&eacute; gets to lead the Mossad, and you have an opportunity for a compelling story with plenty of action.<br /><br />The story contains some wonderful ideas, plot twists and surprises; unfortunately, they are not well executed.<br /><br />The character development is lacking and confusing. I found that, even by the end of the book, I was not invested in any of them. The plot was difficult to follow and there are numerous spots where the explanation for an event or the appearance of necessary equipment seemed to be added in as an afterthought.<br /><br />There are paragraphs that are numerous pages long and places where following the dialogue was trying. Movement of the plot was interrupted more than once by the inclusion such things as the history and evolution of the Tango--while interesting, it stopped the flow of the story.<br /><br />The ideas are good, the imagination rampant and the willingness to put words on the page are present, but regrettably the book doesn't reach its potential. It could use a serious structural editing, followed by a strong copy-editing and proofreading. This would improve the flow, authenticity and consistency as well as correcting the grammar, spelling and punctuation errors.<br /><br />To be fair, at the time of writing this review the book is priced at only $1.01 at Amazon.com so the monetary investment is not great. While it does have some interesting features, I don't think I'd recommend the time investment to read it.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a digital copy of this book free from the author.

It may have some uncomfortable parts in it because of Christian and his past but throughout the books you see him overcome his problems. It is more of a real love story because most relationships have issues to overcome. I loved it!

B00BAXFAOW|4.0|This book is organized into three sections:<br /><br />1. The Advantages of Disadvantages<br />2. The Desirability of Difficulty<br />3. The Limits of Power.<br /><br />In each section there are 3 stories (for a total of 9 stories).<br /><br />What do we learn?<br /><br />1. Sometimes when people have nothing to lose, that can make them into a more fierce fighter<br />2. Sometimes when people are faced with difficulty in accomplishing something, it brings out the best in them as they must invent new strategies to solve the problem<br />3. Power must be coupled with legitimacy.<br /><br />I am not sure how much of this I believe:<br /><br />1. This was true in the case of the Jews in Israel (there were a very few of them and they survived despite the odds), but not true of the many millions more who did not survive the Second World War. Why was *not surviving* the majority case?<br />2. Black people all over the world have disadvantages. Many of them. They have not necessarily become more resourceful because of it. (This is not the Jewish experience, as history has shown them to be very resilient and resourceful.) But there are many more Africans (overseas and otherwise) than there are Jews who have faced much more adversity. Why haven't the majority of them turned out to be accomplished?<br />3. Does power really have to be coupled with legitimacy? The Taiwan government is not actually legitimately the government of the whole of China (for most of the world except the Vatican)-- but they do have power in Taiwan. The CCP (the power behind the Chinese throne) is extremely corrupt and is openly a tool of patronage for the children of senior Party members. They aren't really legitimate (in the Gladwell sense of the word), but they are the sole source of power on the Mainland. The Dalai Lama feels that he is the legitimate ruler of the Tibetan people and claims to speak on their behalf. But what power does he have?<br /><br />There were some things that I did already know:<br /><br />1. He makes a discussion of diminishing returns / U shaped curves with respect to education. That case is believable.<br />2. Some experimental advances take a maverick to happen and the establishment often sneers-- at the beginning.<br /><br />Verdict: This book is worth the Kindle price and it only takes 2 afternoons to ready. I'd recommend picking it up.w:<br /><br />1. He makes a discussion of diminishing returns / U shaped curves with respect to education. That case is believable.<br />2.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|While it is always interesting to gain some new perspective on the historical figure Jesus of Nazareth, Aslan treads in some iffy territory with &#34;Zealot&#34;.  He tends to use Acts as historically reliable, but then has Paul's version stating otherwise.  I think one would also be hard pressed to find a serious scholar that accepts Luke (let alone Acts) to be written by an eyewitness.  And the Epistle of James written *by* James the brother of Jesus? It gets to a point where some claims are pretty questionable.  An intriguing book, given the backlash Aslan faced on Fox News, but I think some deeper investigation into his claims needs to be done.

B00F57VFXO|4.0|This book is written with one madly exciting, improbable and bloody escapade after the other.<br />It reads exactly as a James Bond film plays out.  The cover looks modern and has the usual type of model type holding a gun and positioned on a red (bloody?) background. This does reflect the contents of this novel.<br />I find it all too unbelievable but if one enjoys the James Bond films then this book is a perfect read.  The agent is portrayed as capable of amazing feats and seems to be too good and, at everything.  He fights, shoots, uses natty and deadly equipment to perfection.  HE ALWAYS WINS.  He is irresistible to women of all types and nationalities, if they are married it is irrelevant.<br />He is extremely well educated, handsome to a \\"head-turning\\" degree, has money, a good background, dresses to perfection and seems to lack.nothing.<br />He is too much and what men either imagine themselves to be, or would prefer to be. The star has to be taken away as a protest against the male ego, too much of the fantastic and yet more of the assumption, implied or wished for, that women are at the beck and call of men.<br />If ever there was a book that clearly explains style over substance then this it it, that being insisted upon despite the 100% success rate of this agent.<br />It is an exciting, surprising, shocking , gory occasionally but an gripping read if one is in.the mood.<br />I think the most thought  provoking aspect is not what is written but the absolute  implication of how people are affected by war and what they will do in the name of it. My final thoughts are not of the book but rather wondering about the type of things that were done during this time.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I want to start by saying that I loved the first two books in this series. As I was reading them I felt like I really cared about the characters, connected to them emotionally and struggled to put the books down. So I went into this book with high expectations. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. Normally I really like books that switch up the point of view to multiple characters chapter by chapter, but I didn't enjoy that in this story. I felt like Tris and Tobias were written so similarly in this book that sometimes I forgot which character I was even inside the head of in some chapters. I was so excited about going outside of the city and learning about how and why the factions were set up, but when it all played out it just seemed like a depressing acknowledgement that in the future people are going to continue to be prejudiced and class-ist and repeat the same mistakes we have made over and over in the past.<br />In the first two books I felt a connection and cared deeply for all of the characters that were introduced. For some I had strong positive feelings (Tris, Tobias, Christina etc) and others I strongly disliked (Peter, Tobias's parents ect), regardless I they moved me to want to discuss them and the books and talk about it and think about it even when I wasn't reading. In this third book I cared very little about any of the new characters that were introduced.<br />Spoilers<br />The end of the story was such a disappointment. I am not one of the reviewers who is angry that Tris died... if it was necessary for the story for her to ultimately die then I am on board for that... However in this story I don't feel that it was written in a way that made that necessary. I see her sacrificing herself for her brother, showing her forgiveness and not just throwing her life away like she may have earlier in the series, but it still felt like a waste. It was so anticlimactic and there are no repercussions for those involved, they just have their memories erased absolving them of the crime. On the other hand with Tobias it seems like everything just turns around for no reason with his mother. The whole trouble could have been avoided by just having a conversation between them and she would give it all up like that?  That is so cheap and easy and makes all the deaths appear to have happened in vain and been totally avoidable. That feels like a slap in the face when you deeply cared for those characters.<br /><br />Good things- I continue to love the references to Chicago and the Midwest where I am from, so cool to have a character from Peoria when I live 10 minutes away. I really liked how the different landmarks in Chicago were part of the story throughout the series.<br /><br />Roth can we just have you rewrite this one? Clearly you can do an amazing job, just look at the first two books. So I say... try again.

The two adult children of the deceased bring in legal firepower to prove that the will is invalid and the estate should belong to them. This is an absorbing story which I couldn't put down.  It was fun to picture Matthew McConaughey as Jake, Ashley Judd as Carla and Donald Sutherland as Lucien, from their characters in the movie.
B000002L7J|5.0|On 'Meat Is Murder' from 1985 Johnny Marr really stepped up to the marr(k). As well as writing the music and playing the guitar he handled production duties for the first time; how old was he again ? 22 or something - quite amazing. 'Headmaster Ritual', and 'Barbarism Begins At Home' are Smiths highlights if such a thing is possible for this particular band who hardly put a foot wrong in their five short years together. What a discography. Really, it is hard to think of a drum, bass and guitar album since this one that has eclipsed it. Johnny Marr should be afforded some sort of award for his guitar work here. It is something very very special. Like the more poppy 'Strangeways, Here We Come', this is better than the debut and the much lauded but less consistent follow up 'The Queen Is Dead' from an overall musical point of view. 'Meat Is Murder' is frequently maligned for some reason even by fans who sometimes mistakenly shout this one as the weakest. (Morrissey fans ??)<br /><br />Morrissey is not at his absolute best here, I would admit, but he is still in the stupendous category make no mistake. This record is perhaps much more weighted to the negative side of life lyrically than their other albums with a genuine sadness that can almost be tangibly felt being communicated. It helps if you feel the pain:<br /><br />'I've seen this happen in other people's lives and now it's happening in mine'<br /><br />on repeat is poignant, as is especially:<br /><br />'When you say it's gonna happen now, well when exactly do you mean?, see I've already waited too long, and all my hope is gone'.<br /><br />Some of his wittiest lines are also found here:<br /><br />'I smoke cause I'm hoping for an early death, and I need to cling to something',<br /><br />and:<br /><br />'I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen, every sensible child will know what this means'<br /><br />Humour happens to be a huge part of the band's legacy. He also managed to popularise the phrase 'Meat Is Murder' perhaps even inventing it- not sure about that. As the lyrics focus on the young, and the very young so much, I have found this hurts the record just a tad as I've got older. Morrissey also did a first rate job on the vocals supplementing with yelps, growls and other extras on this record.<br /><br />Another point I'd like to make is that Mike Joyce's unobtrusive drumming and Andy Rourke's bass lines are excellent here. This album shows their chemistry was simply on a different level to most bands. Cover bands rarely come within a mile of these guys. In percentage terms though I can't resist opining that Johnny should have been angling for 51% - catch my drift ?
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this novel! The characters. The language. The story. This is my third time reading it. I have it both in print and on my Kindle. I will never tire of it: it is so beautiful and romantic. It is not poorly-written or trashy like some popular novels today.

B00EFLLVKI|5.0|This was an excellent book.  The kind that you can get lost in and look forward to reading in all your spare moments.<br /><br />Giacomo and Michela ride the same tram to work every morning in Italy.  Giacomo desperately yearns to see her each morning as he boards the tram.  From their stolen glances at each other and their reflections in the tram's windows, it becomes quite clear that they have \\"noticed\\" each other.  One fateful morning, Michela finally speaks to Giacomo, inviting him for coffee.  She's leaving the next day for New York City as she's relocated her job.  Feeling a myriad of emotions, Giacomo is tentative and doesn't ask for her email or forwarding information.  However, Michela leaves an envelope from her NYC office on the table as she leaves for the rest room.  Giacomo jots down the address and stews for several months about whether to make contact with the woman who captivated him on the morning tram rides.<br /><br />As he grapples with this decision, he is supported by the friendship of Silvia, a former girlfriend and lover, now his best friend.  Giacomo's love life is a bohemian existence.  He loves to travel, work and make love in a multitude of cities.  He is not a gigilo, he is just a product of his experiences with unfaithful girlfriends and the effects of a father who abandoned him. One of the best aspects of the book is the inherent goodness of Giacomo.<br /><br />Of course, Giacomo decides to find Michela in NYC.  She is a fascinating character with unconventional ideas and fiercely independent.  The dialogue is so unexpected and interesting which lends to the gripping nature of the book.  Their physical passion for each other as well as dining at a wide array of eateries in NYC are a luxurious read. One doesn't know how this unique relationship will pan out, but you're rooting for them the whole way.
0316219266|3.0|Too author-centric ... Brad Stone actually wrote an &#34;opinion&#34; article but took a whole book to do it in.  Confusing writing style - flips from chronological to issue to corporate importance back to historical ...
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was not a sequel to A Time to Kill but takes place 3 years later in 1988 with the same main characters - so I liked them already.  It was a good read, suspenseful and a good courtroom drama from the former lawyer.  I would recommend it.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|OK, OK I think I understand why people hated it.  Alex Ross' negative analysis in the New Yorker seemed fair.  However, I enjoy this &#34;Ring&#34; immensely.  I think it probably does work better on disc than in the opera house. . .a friend who saw it live claims the creaking of the machine was louder than the cries of the Valkyries. . .but he is prone to hyperbole.  Eric Owen and Jonas Kauffman are unsurpassed and Terfel and Voight were better than I anticipated.  To be honest, I would give &#34;Rhinegold&#34; 2 stars and all the others at least four.  But, unlike most &#34;Rings&#34;, when it's over, I don't feel ashamed for having wasted so much time. . .hence the 5 stars. Better than the sum of its parts.

B0093OGBL6|5.0|Dr.Karen Moriarty, I would like you to see this... my deep bow of respect to you. For you, Dr.Karen, is simply the best. I mean you book is simply the best in a long string of the books about incomparable Michael Joseph Jackson I've been insatiably consuming all these years, especially four last ones. I think I'm entitled to explain why I found your book the best. Here we go: first of all, being a life-long Michael Jackson die hard fan and admirer thus being profoundly acquainted with Michael's biography I easily am able to spot misprints, errors and mishmash in MJ events, facts of life and dates. To my amaze I found NONE in your book and believe me, it was under tough scrutiny. The data was relayed thoroughly,  with precision and accuracy of a scientist. It was  a laboratory work, dear author, especially with the longest list of the materials examined, browsed and reviewed by you.<br />Secondly: the book was highly educative to me, like no other. The last four years of Michael's life were much more reclusive than the previous ones of his, so even we, long time fans knew less about his life during this period, and the facts were rare and spontaneous. Your chapters dedicated to these last years of his life gave me a neat and sharp picture of what was going on there.<br />Thirdly: the help chosen by you to give birth to this wonderful book also amazes me: only strictly and highly reliable sources, small range of good, kind and decent persons who really knew and loved  Michael Jackson which makes the book the precious source of information for those who wonder.<br />But above all this what makes this book “ a killer” is the author's compassionate and loving heart, its beat of humanity I was hearing through the pages.... I shed rivers of tears, I smiled, I sometimes laughed... all those human feelings were brought following the incredibly abundant MJ life and the way the author delivered the story. Love and appreciation of MJ's unparallelled genius transcend every page. Being a fan from Russia I should confess I gasped and broke when encountered with the story surrounded MJ Dangerous concert in Moscow in 1993, the story well-known in Russia but maybe not elsewhere in the world. And every word is true, all the details, both ugly (from officials) and wonderfully cordial (from Michael). And thank you so much for mentioning my good friend Larisa, a very strong, “heart and soul” devoted MJ Russian fan!!<br />I'm grateful to you for exposing different views of various groups of people and fans in regard of Michael's greatness and uniqueness with no judgment at all, telling about these groups with positiveness and sometimes with big appreciation.  Yes, I myself belong to the group of the fans who believe in Michael's divinity and I'm proud to be in this group. Many of us ALREADY understand who Michael was and is and with what mission he was sent here down on Earth. I hope many generations to come will have that joy and sorrow to yet discover... Years will pass, lies will dissolve and be forgotten, instead the giant figure of that KING of a man, humanity and music will shine on brighter than ever.<br />The book's title does not deceive: the level of defending the KING is just overwhelming!<br />Dr. Karen...  Dear doctor, you have accomplished your professional duties capitally because your book to me and I dare say to millions of other MJ fans is “a healer”. Well, we know, that's what good doctors  are for...<br />with L.O.V.E.<br />Irina Eropolova<br />Moscow<br />Russia

B001WCN232|5.0|Just sitting around on a Saturday and I put this one on. I have always loved this album and I realized just how much again, today. The first tune is the weakest on the album. Not necessarily bad, just the weakest. But the next song, 100 Years Ago, is the true Rolling Stone forgotten classic, and that's saying something. The album just flows on through from there. A worthy addition to any Rocker's catalog.
B0064W67IM|5.0|Neil Gaiman is the best. I've also loved his other vertigo characters. Tim Hunter from the Books of Magic. I'm also reading the Children's Crusade crossover series, which stars the Dead Boy Detectives, another great creation of his. Their origin story will be in volume 4 Of the Sandman books. But getting back to the Sandman, this book was great. It had horror, comedy, superhero's,, and a great character in dream the Sandman. I will read more of Mr Gaiman's saand I will tell you what I think of them.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first two books in this series would receive five plus stars if possible. I was so excited for this book to come out, my calendar was marked a countdown and everything. The talk in the teacher's lounge was all about the release of this final book and we were highly recommending this series to our students. I am sad to say that this book did not come close to reaching the value I place in the rest of the series. The book seemed rushed and Allegiant was not hard to put down to do other activities.
B007L6VR12|4.0|Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two troubled, misunderstood kids who meet and bond over their inability to fit in. It’s certainly not a revolutionary plot, but this movie is anything but run-of-the-mill. Quite the opposite actually – it’s fantastic. Equal parts quirky, charming, witty, and genuinely funny, it’s a deft and completely distinctive rendition of this well-worn tale.<br /><br />There’re just so many great things to say about this film. Right from the opening credits it establishes a very unique tone with the musical selection, setting, and (most notably) the camerawork. The cinematography remains consistently amazing throughout the movie, utilizing really creative, often symmetrical shot compositions and lots of side-tracking pans. The visuals play an integral role in setting the off-kilter and playful atmosphere of the film (think Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson’s last film).<br /><br />The cast is also excellent across the board, and what’s really impressive is that the two child leads manage to steal the show from huge names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and Bill Murray. And the success of the two leads isn’t just due to acting ability, it’s also simply because the characters are really well-crafted and endearing. They both have an unabashed eccentricity and deadpan humor (think Napoleon Dynamite) that just makes them very likable and easy to root for. The deadpan humor is also a very integral part of the success of the film. There’s definitely a serious message here about never compromising who you are to fit in with crowd, but it’s delivered in a very light-hearted, good-humored way that never takes itself too seriously.<br /><br />Overall, Moonrise Kingdom is a movie that gets nearly everything right. It’s a movie during which you just can’t help but smile from beginning to end and which is bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm. The only real criticisms I can muster is that the middle third drags just a tad and that I wish there was a bit more resolution with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (the parent characters of the female lead). Aside from these minor quibbles though, the movie impresses on every level and is a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming affair.<br /><br />4.5/5dle third drags just a tad and that I wish there was a bit more resolution with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (the parent characters of the female lead).

B0051T47NQ|4.0|Funny, pretty good plot and good CG. It's better (IMO) if watched in the original language with English subtitles. It starts a little slow but once you are into it, it gets better.

B007HJ91HU|1.0|I hate when actors/actresses in their mid to late twenties are cast to play teenagers.  Not only were these actors too old to play teenagers, they looked too old for the parts. With all the talent there is out there, I don't understand it.  Completely ruined the movie for me.  I might have enjoyed it if it had been cast differently.

B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Good grief people take things sooooo serious! This was a fun movie - pure entertainment. It's shallow and ridiculous, to be sure, but that's what made it so much fun. There were good guys - I don't want to know their whole life history - just shoot the bad guys (whom I also don't need to know their life histories either). If I had any real complaint it would be shooting down Air Force One with an ICBM - but at least the effects were good for that scene and they didn't take 5 minutes to mourn those lost in the crash! And as a bonus it was all shot with &#34;shaky camera syndrome&#34;. An excellent homage to Die Hard and Lethal Weapon types.

076115678X|4.0|The tween/teen-style language can be a bit distracting for an adult reader but I learned a lot from this book about how to take care of my very curly-haired daughter's tresses. I found it very helpful that it covers different types of curls and appreciate the do-it-yourself recipes.
0345803485|1.0|Many reasons this book irritated me: First, there is a reason you should only base a story on a location you know well... To people in Seattle, it's NOT called 'the\\" I-5... you don't go from Vancouver Wa towards Portland to get to Seattle, Bellevue is not located anywhere along the I5 corridor, and it's not called the 'Pike Place District'  ...(End Washingtonian rant)<br /> Second, this book got such huge hype - But it just doesn't read well - it jumps around a lot, changing direction without even a new paragraph to separate the start and stop of flow.<br /> Third, for a BDSM style book, it is sooo NOT sexy. Perhaps to those who've never even heard of such a thing, it might intrigue - But I have read better stories on the internet - my own mother reads better introductory sex stories on her Harry Potter fanfic site (and I've heard the writer adapted this book from their own fanfic story)<br /> Glad I didn't pay for the book - and I just can't bring myself to read the rest in the series, free or not.

This is definately one of the better albums because the messeges in the songs are more relavant than ever.

B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Loved the way this book explained those weight control issues that have bugged me:  If exercise is such a great weight-loss tactic, why do I always need a snack afterward?  Why is it that my most obese friends don't actually appear to eat that much?  I know my own recent weight gain is related to menopause, but why and how do I counteract it?  The book in brief:  Fat and meat are good; potatoes and grains are bad, and load up on salad.  Let me correct some of reviewers' comments:  Taubes does not disparage science; rather, he disparages nutrition and diet &#34;experts&#34; who have actually been ignoring real science in favor of conventional wisdom.  He does not discourage exercise, only notes that it is not effective for weight loss because we have cause and effect backwards (exercise does not make losing weight easier; losing weight makes exercise easier).  I recommend reading the book and incorporating the advice into a diet that makes sense for you.  What I would NOT recommend is following the diet at the end of the book, which is has all the hallmarks of a &#34;fad diet.&#34;  He allows absolutely NO fruit of any kind, no grains of any kind not even whole grains and absolutely no sugar ever.  He remarks early in his book that low calorie diets are doomed to fail because nobody can follow that for the rest of their life and the same applies to this. But in the text of his book he allows that moderate utilization of his advice can be beneficial and that would be the way to go.

B006TF6WAM|4.0|Wow, how can a book be so happy and so sad at the same time?<br /><br />Harold and Maureen are senior citizens whose marriage cooled off several years ago, and they are really only housemates. One morning, a goodbye letter arrives from Queenie Hennessy, a former work friend Harold hasn't seen for twenty years. She tells him that she's dying and all sorts of memories are stirred up for Harold.<br /><br />He sets off to post a condolence letter but it doesn't seem adequate. He intends to walk to the next letter box, and then to the next town, but finishes hiking all the way up the centre of Britain to deliver it in person. His quest is all tied in with a challenge from a shop girl to never give up but cling to faith that things might change.<br /><br />As he walks, he processes all sorts of buried memories about his earlier life with Maureen and their son, David. Harold feels as if he's failed everybody. We know that he let Queenie take the blame for something he did, although it isn't clear what. We also know that he feels he let David down, although we aren't sure why. This makes his journey all the more interesting, as we expect all will be revealed at the end.<br /><br />When it came, I wasn't prepared for the shock and emotion of it all. Whoa, it definitely explains such a lot about all four main characters, Harold, Maureen, David and Queenie. How heart-wrenching. Until I got near the end, I was wondering what other reviewers meant, as it seemed like a whimsical, happy book.<br /><br />There was a lot to like about it. There should be more heroes like Harold. His story shows that we should never underestimate the quiet, self-effacing type who never seem to have much to contribute.<br /><br />I like Maureen, and the fact that Harold's walk helped her work through many issues, to realise all that he really meant to her. I hope people who are considering making David's decision may stop to ponder the repercussions in the lives of their loved-ones, which may go on and on for years.<br /><br />I think it's a book that reveals significance in the most seemingly bland memories, and that so often, the apparently small things turn out to be the big things.d on for years.<br /><br />I think it's a book that reveals significance in the most seemingly bland memories, and that so often, the apparently small things turn out to be the big things.

B00GOA27LU|1.0|Why can't we purchase this episode?!?! I pay to watch an episode every week and for some licensing agreement we all of a sudden cannot purchase the next episode?! Come on amazon!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i love this game. But i cant get past level 23.Its really getting on my nerves. Oh my god<br />.
0061478784|5.0|Love this story and Diana Wynne Jones. She is the best! My family reads all her books and we love the characters and settings she creates..
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Really like the handiness of  getting  the local daily weather without turning on the television or radio.  I use it often
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Actually good character development even minor characters at this point.  Should be required reading for every male interested in pleasing his
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I love this movie.<br /><br />There are no other words, EXCEPT I wish I waited to buy this at Target for like $3. But whatever price I originally bought it, (currently $5 now) it's still worth it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm overall quite happy with my Chromecast.  Happy enough in fact to have bought another.  The video and audio quality are great and the convenience is really tough to beat.  We use it mostly from our phones (both Android and iPhone) to watch Netflix shows on the big screen, but not purely because we like using our cell phones for this.  In fact, we've found that trying to use it from our laptops is pretty unreliable (works about 50% of the time).  Still, at $35, I can tolerate a little bugginess that I'm sure will get worked out with future software releases.
1604590483|5.0|I originally just bought this as a gift for a family member so I have no formal knowledge about the book, though I can say that it did help my stingy relative become more worldly and less agitated, which is nice.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|In the early 90s, just when the single &#34;Think Twice&#34; was about to break her through globally as the most popular female singer in the world, Celine showed her &#34;best side&#34; to a photographer, and turned her back. There's an actual picture in &#34;Q&#34; magazine of the back of her hairdo. So I didn't doubt for a second that she grasped the brutal emotional core of Janis Ian's song &#34;At Seventeen.&#34; Whether it was for being apainfully thin teenager, a French Canadian hick, or less sexy than a print ad model, Celine conveys the pain of ostracism with first-hand believability and lets a listener know that she or he is not alone. Brava, and go, girl.
B00005JLKN|5.0|This is a review solely for the package itself and not the content of the movie. If you want reviews of the movie, go to IMDb or something.<br /><br />So the DVD came in good shape and it works well. I actually haven't watched it in a few years, but I remember it being good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|been playing this on phone and now kindle fire. occasional lag to game but that just gives my fingers a much needed rest. love this game.
0061122416|5.0|I bought this book for a summer assignment in high school and it is honestly one of the best books school has ever forced me to read.<br /><br />So good that I must rephrase &#34;force&#34; to introducing.
0865478015|2.0|The book covers a lot of basic psychology reasonably well but it wraps it in a gimmick about being &#34;negative.&#34;<br /><br />Most of the material that it covered which I was well verse in was covered fairly accurately but he does distort a few things and just get facts wrong here and there in order to fit the gimmick. And there is one painful passage where he tries to reconcile his liberal politics (poverty is bad) with his argument that happiness doesn't depend (much) on your environment (poverty doesn't have bad consequences).<br /><br />The one harsh criticism I have for the book is that it is marketed as a self-help book and not a mix of humanist essays and pop-psychology. This book is unlikely to make anyone happier for reasons discussed in the book--you would have to actually DO things differently to feel differently. Reading about doing things differently doesn't count as acting differently.
0316168815|5.0|This book hurt my feelings in many ways, and the ending left me in a state of shock and denial. Which is good, for a book.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Great album all of the way through.  Certainly better than their first album (Dreaming Out Loud) and arguably better than their second album (Waking Up).  Everyone probably knows the first three tracks (Counting Stars, If I Lose Myself and Feel Again), but the CD is really worth listening all of the way through.  In my car, I listened to it from beginning to end and back to the beginning again without ever thinking about switching what I was listening to.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I liked this book, but it wasn't fantastic.  Too much going on way too fast.  There's a lot of potential, but it didn't hold my interest enough to  spring for the next book.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|Funny yet typically Roland E roller coaster of a film. Channing and Jamie had good chemistry and seemed like well developed characters, but two out of 30 or so named characters isn't enough when the rest are one dimensional and outdated stereotypes at best (and eyebrow-less James Woods at worst). I liked the action of Olympus Has Fallen better, but the aforementioned duo edged this one a little higher on my &#34;like&#34; scale than Olympus.<br /><br />At least there weren't atheists getting clingy with bibles, aliens getting defeated by Mac-delivered viruses, misinterpretations of super calderas, or baby godzillas in this one :)
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I just finished MGS 1 and am currently starting MGS 2. Amazing value for someone like me who has yet to experience the entire series!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I think I have read better stories covering the period leading up to WW2 and the war.I thought the first book in the trilogy was bettr, and I am looking forward to the final book
B00BUT5I84|2.0|I was absolutely amazed at the sheer awesomeness of This Is War.  This album, however, doesn't seem to pull off the theatrical mastery that TIW did.  There are a few good songs in the album, but I don't find myself reaching for it very often.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|It is fairly easy to use for someone who is relatively inept when dealing with technology  You are being pushy..
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|I'm a recent Gaga convert.  I have listened to her headliners over the years when I'm listening to the radio, but only recently I decided to check out her iTunes Festival performance.  She seems to be REALLY into her fans, and I dig that in musicians.  It adds an extra layer to the performance.<br /><br />So I decided to give this album a go, as &#34;Applause&#34; has been the most successful ear-worm of all time, in my brain.  This album did not fail to impress, and I have listened to it beginning to end four times now.  I can't find a single track that I want to skip - I just listen to them all.<br /><br />The difference between Gaga and the other current female pop stars is that she has a fantastic voice.  My wife showed me an acoustic video of her performing Paparazzi on the piano (just her in a studio - no electronic devices), and her voice is simply incredible.  Girl's got raw talent.<br /><br />On to the audio quality!  I'm a bit of an audiophile, and I usually listen to music through a headphone amplifier into my Sennheiser HD595 headphones.  Not uber rich, but very sonically clear.  I bought this album in mp3 version rather than getting the CD to rip into ALAC because I figured it would be compressed to garbage, like most pop music is today.  I'm pleasantly surprised that the studio mastering on this album is VERY good.  Everything is really clear with virtually no distortion or audible compression throughout the entire album.<br /><br />The album sounds so aurally good that it almost makes me wish I had purchased the CD to get a full lossless rip.  Nonetheless, the 256kbps Amazon version sounds very good, and I'm very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Love her or hate her, buy this album, and you won't be able to get these songs out of your head for a long time.  :)
B0045TYDNC|5.0|OK, I don't actually &#34;Love it&#34; as it is just a rear lens cap. It's the original Nikon part.<br />I bought it for the kit lens of my camera as it came with a white plastic one with out threading.
B00E1LQ7Q0|4.0|I really, really enjoy this album (these albums).  I haven't been a JT fan for long, but after hearing Mirrors on the radio, I pre-ordered the complete 20/20 experience.  The only downside I can find to the entire album is Jay Z.  It seems like every song he's featured on these days, he's just saying, &#34;UH, UH, UH&#34; in perpetuity.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a good album.  I don't pick it over others on a regular occasion, but when you're in the mood for JT, you're in the mood for JT.
B005T87QCI|4.0|This app is really fun, but almost anything cool you need to buy, such as the build your own robot. Overall, really fun though.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|I love this game.  I would have given it 5 stars but it crashes at least once per level.  It is extremely annoying to have the game crash and kick you out right before you finish a level so you lose all the money you made and have to restart the game.  But I keep going back so it has to be pretty good.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|(MY BOOK REVIEWS HAVE NO SPOILERS)<br /><br />One of the great things about this book is that it applies to virtually everyone.  Social media is a growing, living thing... and The Circle is one look at how it could evolve.  Putting it simply, this book will suggest that you determine your own comfort with the progress being made by social media.  I read this book at the same time as a friend, and it stimulated some interesting conversation... of which we agreed and disagreed in equal amounts.<br /><br />The writing is perhaps not Eggers' best, but it's certainly good enough for his points to be made.  I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic of social media, and it's place in the world.
B004X80QNG|2.0|It doesn't tell me what I don't already know. I could compare it to a democrat but at least the pocket conformity won't lie
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Addictive and frustrating! The rewards are geared to make you purchase additional bingo cards. Rewards are low on achievements,  takes way too long to move to higher levels!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Robert Duvall really makes this show a big treat.  His portrayal of Augustus McRae encouraged me to look up more of his work.  He is an actor who only gets better and better as he ages.  I purchased Open Range because of him, and also watched Tender Mercies and loved every minute of it on Encore.  May he live long and prosper in whatever he chooses to do.  He is one of the few riders who Really rides  cowboy style, instead of bouncing all over the place.  And he is just as graceful on the ground.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This game was great.  It has a nice story line,  a beautiful setting,  gorgeous scenery and a well developed mode of game play.  Puzzles are fun but not too hard,,  its mostly finding the clue and applying it to the correct puzzle to solve.  Music is great and enhances the other-worldliness-feel that the graphics pull you in with.  Overall game play was just under 3 hours,  which makes this 99 cent game really worth the money... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had heard a lot of criticism about Orson Scott Card being a heavy &#34;Christian&#34; writer and not beig a serious science fiction writer. This story and universe contain spiritual elements, but that II is of a nature that the best writers explore. Strongly recommended for all ages.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|It is just one of the best albums that he ever made.  Have to listen to it with Volume.<br />Awesome
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great addition to the Bond movies.  Loved the plot and also the characters and the development of them throughout the movies.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love MIcheal Buble voice!  One of the greatest singer of the day.  We have all of his CD's, our wish is that he would do a concert dvd.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love swiftkey!!  Was years ahead of the stock keyboard app for android.  Only recently has stock keyboard come close to same functionality.  A must have app for me.
1594744769|5.0|One of my favorites books! With a plot that drags you in and real-life photos that both intrigue and frighten you, it's a book you won't want to put down! Can't wait for the sequel!
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book about the Legend of Zelda series.  Beautiful art and very informative book about the series.  Great value for the Zelda fan.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|awesome movie,it tells the way people still using the color to dominate people.It has a bit of everything,we laugh but we cried too
B009JBZH54|5.0|Not too much in way of extra bonuses, but a great way to get the whole Dark Knight Trilogy in one set for a decent price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I knew going into this book that it was good and that I would like it. But oh my God, how much I liked it. If you're reading this to decide whether or not to buy it, you should definitely buy it.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Loved the movie as a kid.  This version brings it in new crisp way of viewing.  Great value with the Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital copies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|tottaly awesome.and a lot like the movie.so funny for little kids.love the movies and the game;keep making movies and games
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Some great music by JT.  Didn't exactly love every single one, but overall felt it was a great album and with the songs being as long as they are, good value for the cost.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|One great game Big Fish has created here.  I have spent hours trying to challenge my way through. Never gets old because of the varied arrangements of the cards and the ability to use your irons to get those last few cards for a perfect round!
0783226845|5.0|I am rarely disappointed in a purchase on Amazon and Scent of a Woman is another item I purchased and fully enjoy watching the movie.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|It does the job, and it does it very well. I love the look and the quick access to all the buttons right on the headset. The sound is very awesome, it's amazing that you can crank it up, have loud game sound and at the same time not feel that your ears will bleed when you are done.<br /><br />CONS: instructions are not too clear, needed to go online and found super clear instructions (for another similar headset) using google.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|I like this game because it is about different creatures dueling each other. Sure you do have to wait a lot but i still like the game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love it! I can't put it down! I'm supposed to be sleeping-- too addictive but fun! All age appropriate! Recommended fore all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE this game .After I finish my homework I watch skydoesminecraft and IhasCupQuake and then I journey through the amazing world of Minecraft!!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game. its hard for me to find apps that really spark my interest but this one did compleatly. good excellent game.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|I have tried to download this game twice now and got a download failure both times on my galaxy s4. I was really looking forward to playing it but it doesn't look like that will ever happen. I would give it 0 stars if it would let me.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Kind of deep for my favorite literary character Bridget Jones... But done effortlessly with her usual messy comedy.  I've missed her and glad she's happy even after such a horrible tragedy.
B0018RC7QE|1.0|We couldn't finish it.  Both parties heading for a train wreck.  Wrong title - should be &#34;Falling in Lust&#34;  Don't need to support the break up of families.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been creating boards since I first started as a Wedding Coordinator many years ago. But Pinterest makes it unbelievably easy to find and share ideas. It's like someone read my mind and created a website from what was in there!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love this..Love that it customisable to my moods. The timer is also great. Worth it...it has helped me relax and fall asleep easier.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I really like this app.  So often you hear music and have to know who it is.  This app makes that possible.  I would highly recommend it.
B00756GKBA|5.0|It's been more than a year and I am still trying to eat this album, to devour it. Madge is a genious
0345530578|5.0|This is just pure vintage Grisham.  It's darned good, well written and superbly entertaining.  Right up until the end, you have no idea if the protagonist will be completely successful in his, let's say, venture.  I didn't see the plot twists coming, which made it even more enjoyable.  Grisham has such a relaxed and meaningful storytelling voice, that it's almost comforting to pick up his books and lose yourself in them.  Comparing Grisham to Grisham, is this his best work?  Problably not, but it's definitely in his top 5.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I got this I loved it was so good I builder a house I found diamonds<br />Five stars the mommy's is worth it
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The game is alot of fun. This game is most likely the best shooter on android amaxing graphics. Its a big game to download but its really worth it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is a great game I love it a great game is what I need that is why I love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this is finally available again for the Kindle Fire! I never have any problems loading the game or connecting to Facebook, and actually prefer playing the game on the Kindle Fire rather than the laptop or PC for the simple reason that the mobile version allows you to keep and store all of the extra lives and gifts that you are given.<br /><br />When playing the game on the laptop or PC, each time you load the game, if you are already at maximum lives then all of the gifts you are given just vanish into thin air and disappear into Candy Crush land never to be seen again. Knowing I get to keep my goodies is good enough reason for me to download this app. Love it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|fascinating characters, interesting storyline, grabs you from the beginning and takes you on a journey! read it! I loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I hate that one can play for a short time i.e. ran out of lives and then have to purchase or wait up to half an hour to regenerate.  Don't seem to be able to play as a stand alone game.  The intent is for FACEBOOK to share into on your page to attrack other players and when one does not play it becomes more info that I need to know<br /><br />Stucked on level 65 for  weeks with no possible help as I believe all moves are programmed.  Really close to cancel uninstall the game.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Amazing story. Beginning is a little bit slow going. But there after it is un-put-down-able. Even though the episode is unbelievable, nevertheless it is a wonderful story line & masterful story-telling.<br />In fact one of the best thrillers I have read in recent times.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great family movie! It made us laugh and cry. It also made us get on our knees and pray to God.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|so glad this is finally for the kindle. Love this game and it synced up to my facebook account so I didn't have to start all over again.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think it is really cool but my kindle broke.And my dad said I could&quot;nt get it again so I cant get it again.
0545626382|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and the receiver was ecstatic! I appreciate how it is nicely arranged in a box set and easy to wrap!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This was an amazing book that allowed me to picture Swat. It also helped me to understand some things. Although horrible things are written about, love and strength prevails through out.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Many years ago I read and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I recently saw the 2013 movie adaptation. It was very well done, entertaining, and thought provoking. I wish it would have been significantly longer to alow better charater development. It stimulated me to go back and re-read the novel again. Having done so, I'm so glad I did. It was even better the second time around. I'll be pondering and debating the themes, characters, events, and my conclusions for a long time. Jeffrey Frank Herrick from Helena, montana.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Might be the best survival/hunting knife out there... VERY heavy/sturdy blade, nice sheath and quality all around, also have a Gerber LMF2 which I rate about the same but one has some features over the other... although I have had some minor issues with the Gerber blade.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app allows me to record stuff and the other apps they do noting...just ASDFGHJKLGCJDJWJDNDDDFMSNRCKSKXJX@$&amp;_():;&quot;-!#=/+?'&quot;120394747576960@0... i don't know why I did that. But yeah! Dis a guud aupp! LOLOLOLOLOL.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game is is amazing . And fun you can unlock a lot of guns and different places to hunt
B003BWERF8|3.0|Worked great when I had it. So small I was worried I would lose it- And I did. Does suck the battery really fast.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app sucks. Because it froze my tablet 2 times  f this game$$$!!!  #sucks like crap going to upgrade the app right know because it sucks .......sorry creater  that your game sucked make anew one that works next time . I hate the app
B008YE9226|1.0|THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE. IT IS RAMBLING AND IS NOT AT ALL INTERESTING . MR GAIMAN SHOULD TRY A NEW PROFESSION FOR HE IS CERTAINLY NO AUTHOR,
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This is a good story. It is also very confusing and very involving, with lots of turns and twists to keep you from guessing the truth.  Worth the time spent getting to know the characters .  This author has a different spin on story telling that really holds your interest.
B00EMJD6TC|3.0|i have seen better and have seen worse.<br />you have to be a brad pitt fan to really like this.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|i like this game it is really cool i love its just so cool and fun i play it a lot
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, Orson Scott Card is an amazing writer, and has an ability to bring his characters to life like no other author I've ever read. It's like they are real people, not just fictional characters. I find myself being drawn into their lives almost against my will, even those characters that I don't really care for. There is an authenticity about Card's writing that makes me want to run away. Maybe that's one of the reasons I quit reading this book before I finished it. But the main reasons are these: one, it's not really a sequel to Ender's Game, which is what I wanted; and two, I didn't like the fact that the book is so chuck full of religion. Here we have a story that takes place several hundred years into the future, and I'm supposed to believe that traditional religion is still going to play such a huge role in human culture? It's not even &#34;new&#34; or &#34;revamped&#34; religion; it's the same old stuff that people have been believing in and killing each other over for centuries. We're colonizing distant planets, for pete's sake, and we have entire colonies given over to the members of a particular church? I just couldn't buy it. The strong presence of religion in the story is one of the things that made it not feel like a sequel to Ender's Game. I realize the author himself is a religious man, and I guess I can't knock him for putting religion in his book. But that requires a stretching of my capacity to suspend disbelief that I can't quite make. I still feel the characters of Speaker for the Dead calling me back, and maybe one day I'll finish it.
1423141997|5.0|12 year loved it. He read all of other series says this the best. Riobdan is a great writer for tweens
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|This game is nothing like minecraft. Terraria is it's own game idea. And it is produced by Re-Logic, not 505 Games. Terraria was supposed to be for the PC only, but they decided to put it on the xbox so multiplayer would be easier. This is why the controls are so hard.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|Interesting anecdotes, but the book could have been 10 or 20 pages long and still gotten the same message across.
B00297FEUI|5.0|I'm a score whore. I love movie soundtracks, it's a thing of mine. I even love scores for movies I dislike. John Williams work on the Star Wars prequels is superb and arguably better than his work on the OT but the films...we all know how they turned out.<br /><br />Steve Jablonsky and his Transformers music also meets this criteria. To be fair I really like the first Transformers and thought the third was ok, but Revenge of the Fallen is godawful. I mean, it's horrible. It's like Michael Bay is making fun of himself with that film. I only wish the film lived up to the awesome score. Steve Jablonsky has crafted some of THE premiere action adventure music of the past decade imo. It's rousing, robust, exciting and sometimes tender and ever beautiful.<br /><br />If anybody loves film scores like me don't let your dislike for some movies hinder you from exploring their music.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I loved seeing some of my favorite posts in here, but her new material was even better. She talks a lot about the stuff people don't like to talk about or even think about; the chapters on identity really hit home and I found myself more than once saying &#34;Oh my god, I do the same things and now I'll never be able to ignore them again!&#34; But it was also comforting. And ridiculously funny. Love this book!
B004G606K8|5.0|One of my favorite books of all, still many years after I first read these books they still have the power to stir the heart.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Really enjoyed the latest Sanderson book that has several unexpected twist in the story. Will definitely  be purchasing the rest of the series once it has been released.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun to do when ever. I love to do when i am bord cause i makes me happy and entertained
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is like most of John Grisham's books in that it is a very good read. It is well worth spending your time reading another of his solid stories that puts you right into the deep south.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|The best game ever u shud play it the best game ever even if u dnt like games like this i really dnt play games like this but wen i playd this one i enjoyed it play it to this very day
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its so fun because it has a lot of games on it and its free!!!!!!!Love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun and I recommend this game to everyone if they love horses or not again best game ever
B000001GX8|5.0|The CD's are in excellent shape and play perfectly. This is a production that lives up to its reviews and as it is a complete opera it is exactly what I was looking for.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a good book, but I don't think it keeps you in as much suspense as the first two books.  All in all it is a pretty good book.  I did like the ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is intriguing and just difficult enough.  I could figure out what to do eventually but not immediately.  The scenes are beautiful and the music suitable. I am enjoying it and am glad I purchased it.
0316055433|5.0|Donna Tartt has done it again.  Page-turning story of a thirteen-year-old boy who survives a bombing at the Met in NYC.  She deftly ties together art, the reality of NYC, and the sadness of losing parents.  Anyone who can write an almost-800 page book that keeps the momentum going is an amazing author.  My only complaint is that she hasn't written enough books!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun! Free! Fantastic! Great graphics.....1 of best on kindle in my humble opinion. I would recommend this game to just about anyone although there is blood etc. Which may be a bit mature for too small of children.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is a wonderfully enjoyable, feel-good movie with an excellent cast.  &#34;Paul&#34; is science fiction with a HUGE sense of humor.  You do not need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this movie, but if you are a sic-fi fan, there are some lovely touches that you will appreciate.
B00E6G23TA|4.0|I rarely listen to modern interpretations of the Brahms symphonies, because in general I tend to find the pacing sluggish and textures overly muddy, which unfortunately just seems to be how performances practices have evolved over the years in regards to this composer. As a result, I've had to go back in time half a century or more to find interpretations that offer the type of clarity and forward momentum (without sacrificing power) that I prefer in this repertoire. So, when Decca announced this release and a hallowed name like Weingartner was tossed out as a comparison, I knew I had to hear this. Unfortunately while there are some great moments throughout this set, the interpretations lack consistency, and it makes the approach not totally convincing.<br /><br />I think part of the problem may be that Chailly isn't totally convinced about the approach either. Anyone who is familiar with his earlier Concertgebouw cycle, which was the epitome of the ultra-slow, congested interpretations that have become the norm in Brahms recordings over the last quarter century plus, will find that this set represents a big departure, though one he's not totally committed to it seems. Throughout, we find interpretive inconsistencies, such as occasional wild tempo shifts and bizarre accents, as if Chailly hasn't completely made up his mind about which way he wants to go.<br /><br />There's still a lot to like, though. The Third symphony is the highlight of the set, where this approach is applied most evenly and works best for a work such as this, in particular during the at-times unwieldy outer movements. The Fourth is very good as well, although there are points where Chailly misses some of the drama, or struggles with the complex intertwined rhythms Brahms presents in abundance. I think the First also loses some of the potential for power and drama at these speeds, and Chailly zooms past certain areas where he could have offered much more, first during the opening movement and again in the finale, where some breadth and spacing would help, such as during the big choral tune the strings take up mid- movement, and again during the coda. Chailly also does something I absolutely loath in the coda, where the tempi swing wildly from fast to slow to fast again, which for me ultimately spoils things (I really hate when conductors do this).  To make matters worse, he hits Mach 3 during the final big brass chords at the movements crescendo; in a good performance, this should be an exhilirating moment, while here, it passes by so quickly one barely even has time to register, let alone savor it. That being said I actually found the Second to be the weakest of the bunch. The first movement really doesn't come off well at all using the light speed approach, which causes Chailly to either skim over or altogether miss all sorts of lyrical details. The same applies to the inner movements which lose some of the rustic, pastoral flavor that help characterize this work as a whole. The finale is an improvement, but then this piece benefits from \\"get a move on\\" tempi. It still however features some bizarre interpretive choices that I find to be less than a total success.<br /><br />The overtures and Haydn variations again give us more of the same in that they are highly variable in quality, not just from work to work but section to section. The Academic overture probably fares best, but Chailly occasionally struggles with juggling the juxtaposed rhythms Brahms presents. The Tragic overture is unfortunately a bit of a track meet under his baton, and sounds monotonous when played this way. The Haydn variations actually aren't all that bad; but again we get some questionable tempo choices from Chailly from variation to variation. I actually think Chailly is at his best with the shorter dances. However these are lightweight curiosities to me and were certainly not the reason I sought this set out.<br /><br />Eventually, one begins to realize that Chailly simply isn'tattuned to Brahms in the way he is with Stravinsky, Mahler and others. There's really no shame in this, as each conductor has strengths and weaknesses, and quite frankly I don't normally associate Chailly with any of the German Romantics. It also takes a bit of a deft hand to properly delineate and make audible Brahms' often congested orchestral part writing in a satisfying way; this is, alas, something I'm not sure Chailly possesses to the degree needed to allow him to succeed in this regard.<br /><br />Unlike the readings, the sound is uniformly excellent, as this recording is a sparkling new digital affair, and all parts are beautifully captured. Furthermore, the quality of play of the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra is absolutely fantastic. The brass, strings and in particular the winds are all talented individual units, and together the ensemble plays with cohesion, assuredness and authority. Kudos to Chailly for helping to rebuild and reinsert this orchestra into the upper ranks, they come off extremely well throughout regardless of what reservations I may have about the interpretations.<br /><br />Overall, this set isn't bad, but I found myself underwhelmed after having such lofty initial expectations. It was however refreshing to hear the symphonies taken at this clip, something one doesn't normally find anymore aside from the odd \\"period\\" cycle you'll see from a Harnoncourt, Mackerras, etc. It hearkens back to my benchmark interpretational choices, such as those from Beinum, Reiner, Szell, Dorati, Schuricht, Ansermet, Walter (w/ NYPO), Stock, Weingartner and the like. However while Chailly aims for the modern equivalent of this approach, I find he ultimately misses the mark, as what came naturally to those conductors is clearly a struggle for him. I just don't think he's convinced himself, let alone us, that this is his final word on the subject. He has a few new things to say, and this set is worth listening to, but I'd listen closely to the track previews before shelling out $30 for it new.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Great movie!  Highly recommend all three of the Iron Man movies.  Robert Downey Jr makes these a definite must see!!
0345529057|3.0|Far too much death, destruction and violence for me. There were times when I simply had to stop reading the novels for weeks at a time because of all the aggression that was described. Also, I had to make a diagram to keep all the relationships straight for myself (I know there's an index, but that's just overwhelming). GRRM has a true sense of the tragic but I just wish he'd lighten up a bit. If that's how western Europe's Middle Ages unfolded, I'm surprised there's anything left of western civilization. Also, the constant focus on death and sexuality wore me down. I quit reading the series after the fourth book. I'm now watching the series on HBO and loving it.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Wow game is good so far. Not so much the blood but the rest is cool<br />Birds butterflies woods very well done. The sounds put u right on the scene
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I feel like this wasn't done by the people who originally did Slender. It's fun and I think it's as good as you can get on a mobile device but I was certainly not scared like the PC game.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|There are no words that can properly convey the emotions evoked by such a beautiful written trilogy. You'd just have to read it yourself to understand ;)
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is awesome ... that's really all I have to say and this review would be complete but there are minimum word requirements, so let me say that all three games are wonderful and I wish the dev had not gone bankrupt. But such is the nature of the industry; I'll keep my eyes open for future games from the people that used to work there.
0385537131|5.0|This is the third book by Grisham which  I have absolutely  savoured!!  The idea of sitting on pins and needles waiting to see what the lawyers would come up with next, and the sometimes uncomfortable ride with Lettie through  her life left me breathless.  Loved having Jake back, and enjoyed every minute of Lucien.  I devoured this book, and was saddened when it ended.....though I think it ended on a note which  all good and decent people could agree to.  The Judge is a very thoughtful and fair man.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This thing works pretty well. Sometimes apps will lose their connection to it and I'll have to try to reconnect, but the apps I have used with it work great. I would give it five stars if only more apps worked with it. My vote is for HBO GO and Amazon Instant Video, then preferably Vimeo. If Google can add support for those three I'd be happy to give it five stars.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|ME BEFORE YOU: Loved this book and read it in two days.  Characters were great, made me laugh and made me cry.  Highly recommend it!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Cute game but I HATE paying to go to the next level.  I refuse to give them 99 cents everytime to move up, this could really add up.  I tend to play Gems Journey instead which I love.  Unfortunately my relatives are playing this on Facebook.  DUH????
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|IT was nice to find this movie that my whole family can watch - and everyone loves watching it multiple times!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun for awhile but really slow to gain bananas and tokens unless you spend money. Gets a little monotonous after fifteen min or so. But my son likes it!
0545615402|5.0|I absolutely love this collection! I bought two sets, one as a Christmas present for my mom and another one for myself because I'm such a huge Harry Potter nerd. I am extremely happy with the quality of the books and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Harry Potter, especially for such a reasonable price.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Great classic, must see and have in DVD collection.  Recommend to have and loved the time period of the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not a bad little device, but limited use cases. I used it to control youtube video playback on a projector down my driveway for halloween. I was not able to get it to stream video coming from 4G (cell phone) over my home wireless network, to a projector, if the wireless network was not connected to the internet also. Also, it only works if the app you are using is Chromecast enabled, meaning that Google has to have a relationship and integration strategy with that app ….
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Since this is kind of a puzzle game it is a good mind challenge.  You never know what to expect.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I just love this game it Is fun and easier to. Play after the new update  I'm not here No thumbs up I'm starting my opinion
B003YL4L0W|1.0|I read this for a book club and found it trite at best. It doesn't know whether it wants to convert you to become a born-again or convince you to become a lesbian.
1563523302|3.0|It has allot of information, a bit to much for me. If you like allot of data and percentages it has it all. If your looking for ideas to help you grow, you really have to read between the very detailed information.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and frustating at times to try to conplete with other people. I enjoy all the challenges that are sent my way
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|They did a great job of matching character/actors, with the old files/TV shows.  Funny, and I've never once thought that a particular character didn't fit (as compared to the prior movies/shows).
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I love this game but its so malfunctional. It played well for at least 2 weeks after downloading but then all my neighbor's disappeared it says something about assert error. This is very upsetting since it took me a while to get 130 neighbor's.When I say they disappeared I mean I can't visit their farms. However some still send gifts to me but I can't send any back .when I try to send a gift  back to the people that ask it acts as if it has sent the gift but their request stays in my box.I Really like this game ,But until these issues get fixed this game gets 1 star.
0385349947|4.0|I'm actually only half way through, and may take several more months to finish.  While it's interesting, not much has been disclosed which I haven't already read in multiple other books.  Wish I hadn't purchased, but had borrowed from the library (or someone else).
B00CM1S1QK|5.0|Love Nina Simone and I couldn't believe I was able to find this cd set - such a wonderful assortment of her music.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|One of the funnies movies that I've never heard of.  A woman I work with told me how funny it was, so I splurged.  Can't tell you how much I've enjoyed this movie.  I don't watch too many movies multiple times.  In the few months I've had this, I've watched it 4 times.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|I loved: How I Met Your Mother Season 9  It's such a fun series.  We're always waiting to find out who is the mother!!  The characters<br />stay true to their image.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It's a rip off. It works, but it's very limited. One would expect to be able to watch the videos or listen to the songs stored in a tablet or smartphone. But it will only play movies or songs you buy on Google apps. Or what you get on Youtube or Netflix. I expected more from it.
B0049J0DC8|4.0|This is my nephew's favorite.  Every time he comes over we watch at least half of it.  Some funny parts for adults,too.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Highly expected. Great reward. Lovely packaging, great quality. Fantastic movie. Can't wait to watch the second part in december 13th.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Great book. I had to stop reading it halfway to get some work done.<br /><br />Steven Pressfield has gotten work motivation down to a system.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Outstanding sharpness and detail in one of my favorite films of all time. Jim Henson will always be an entertainment god.
1250038820|5.0|This book delivers exactly what it promises.  It is a mainstay on my nightstand and I sure hope Brandon is working on a HONY2!
B001GKWBO6|5.0|Absolutely love this! I bought it for yoga practice but now I'm listening to it all the time! So good!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My vocabulary fails me in describing this book. My heart is beating faster and my mind is that much more imaginative. Excellent. Thanks, Jada for recommending it
B00881VLCE|1.0|was really looking forward to the jigsaw puzzle app on my kindle, but it never came thru to the kindle
B005H0IW6W|5.0|My new favorite Christmas CD! Every song is a new classic that you will enjoy for years to come! A must own!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun. Not too easy,  not too hard.  I can't wait for more levels! I cant believe there's. a 20 word minimum for reviews!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game overall with plenty of ways to get high end items for free. Not a pay to win, but to just get ahead.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen:  You will listen to music from the world's most dynamic stage entertainer.  He is Elvis Presley, a poor southern white boy who blended different kinds of music with his excellent baritone voice. And please do not overlook his ear for music.<br /><br />Stax Recording Studios was usually a place where famous soul artists made many hit records.  Everything points to Elvis having<br />soul also.<br /><br />We are fortunate to have lived at a time that allowed us to be exposed to this great artist.
B000VI12ZS|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. It is a compelling story. The acting is somewhat predictable and flat, but they are shackled by an awful script. But the real blame goes with the director. The military scenes are simply idiotic, almost a parody of really bad war movies. I couldn't get beyond the outrageous silliness of the 'battle' scenes to immerse myself in the story. I didn't even finish the movie. I would avoid this one....
B0090SI460|3.0|Movies all work great. Dvd case arrived with broken blue pieces in it. turns out to be parts of the inside of the case. I dont really know if I would buy a dvd online again.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I loved the setting of this story and the clever  interwoven Doyle tale. I was so happy to spend time again with my hero A Pendergast.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|i am a star trek fan from the 60's .didn't know if i would love this movie- i loved it!!!!  it doesn't take away from the original but enhances the story and beginning- whoo hoo
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a realy realy good book<br />This book is filled with excitment<br />And other thing I'm going to let u figure it out by reading it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great! I play it all of the time. I like that it connects to my fb friends. My parents even started playing!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|With Lady Gaga's new album, we may be now witnessing the peak of her popularity. The album in my opinion, marks where Gaga 'sells out'. Resorting to R&B collaborations and dubstep breakdowns, it could have worked, if executed better. Instead, it sounds cliche, repetitive and boring. Nevertheless, there are a few standout tracks: Applause, Gypsy and the opening Aura (although I wish it didn't end so soon or abruptly). Overall, if you're a fan, go ahead and treat yourself. Otherwise, wait a few months for demand to drop and snag it cheaper, as it's not worth full price for the average listener.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!!!! So glad that Amazon finally decided to have this app!!!! Play all the time!! Thank you Amazon, you rock!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book about eight months ago, before I even knew there was a move about to come out. I really enjoyed it and I'm not a sci-if guy.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love it! It was a good idea. I've gotton so far. Its so detailed and fun! I can not exit the app.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love everything about it - great acting, great writing, great twist on a classic. Thought the female Watson was a bit much at first, but she is a good fit. Intrigued by the recovery from drug addiction theme which runs through it - some very realistic portrayals of addictive thinking - makes Sherlock a very complex but understandable character.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|This is without question the best Superman film ever made. I know that there are a lot of hyper sensitive fanboys who took exception with this film but it is about time that the most recognized Superhero in the world get his proper and fitting due on screen.<br /><br />I also think its important to note that besides the foundation laid by Shuster and Siegel, without question the work of Comic writers John Byrne and Mark Waid heavily influence this film. I recommend that you read Superman Birthright by Waid. This movie borrowed a lot from Superman mythology and it was awesome. I loved it. I highly recommend it and I can't wait until the sequel comes out. Great job Zach Snyder!!!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a really great series and I'm so sad that it is ending:'( I just hope the movie isn't such an epic fail like the mortal instruments city of bones!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Very good movie believe me. I love Tom Cruise but some of his least popular movies are his best ones. This movie and Minority Report.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|This album in my opinion took him into superstar range. He was already on the way there, but this one put him over the top. Great music!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good game! I saw my friends playing it. So I tried it. It is really fun. A challenging puzzle game, requiring logic and cleverness.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I love everything The Piano Guys have recorded and this album is no exception. The DVD is a real bonus
B00992CF6W|5.0|i think yhis game is awsome. ilove playing with my friends! but i think they should have mods in rthe game.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great movie. They brought the book to life.I can't wait for catching fire comes out.I would highly recommend this movie
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love it, so does my daughter-in-law it now resides at her house. The boy's like it too, we have 4 teens, one remarked,<br /> &#34;I thought it was a chick-flick, but it has a great message for all of us.&#34;
B008XKSW7M|5.0|loved the movie I would love to even watch it again I really liked that I could watch it for free being a prime customer too
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This had to be the hit of the Birthday Party. It was a big hit with the Birthday kid, Grandma. And of course the grandkids and the adults loved it too!
B002FVMLGI|5.0|who doesn't love skid row what else can I say I love skid row and I think it was a great buy
B00867GHS8|5.0|We saw this at the theater when we took our grandson's. We loved it and are all in lvd with Dorie!<br />This movie was a Godsend for our Mother who was in the last stages of Alzheimer's, she sat down and was still throughout the entire movie!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|its keeps asking me to review so I decided to follow orders.  yes master!  it is good it has no ads.  I enjoy music
B00867GKIK|5.0|This is so good, I love it! I have watched it 6 times so far everybody really like the Dog, the one who chases the ball, but then who doesn't like talking dogs and birds too!
0061537969|5.0|The writing was very good and moving. I read the book three times. It leaves a lasting impression  And gives a real vieu of the feelings of owner and the pet. I have recommend it to several people.
140191716X|5.0|I love this book! It's uncanny how I could flip through pages and ask my angels what they what me to know for the day how \\"right on\\" they are. Of what I may be experiencing. Gives me peace! I ordered another one for a friend who is going through some rough times. I got mine as a gift. What a blessing it has been. I also have it on my iPhone and on my kindle, Good book!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|They managed to do enough of a twist on the plot on this one to make it interesting and enjoyable.  Superman tends toward a more macho image in this story and definitely sufficiently hot for the ladies.  Good job portraying his celestial as well as earthly families.  Great job on the villains.  Great effects yet some leaning towards what you see in really good game graphics.  It seems like we've seen all the Superman movies and yet we weren't disappointed or ho-hum in watching this one.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|It managed to suck me in, and kept me playing until my battery warning popped up.<br /><br />There are a few minor UI issues, but nothing critical - it is far to easy to accidentally hit the Hint button when scrolling across the screen, and it is also easy to accidentally select a spot while moving around and not notice it. Either of which will cause your score to be less than perfect, but since there is no competition of any kind it is little more than a minor annoyance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So pleased with being able to play on my Kindle! Really enjoy the game. Very addictive. Really recommend this game.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Another WOW!!! movie...it actually brought me to tears, which is NOT a bad thing. I have always had respect for the military but after seeing this movie I can feel their pain they go through...NOT 100% but I can feel it.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|there are few times in life where we can be witness to the presence of greatness. Malala radiates it. The book is a fascinating story of the coming of age of this remarkable girl intertwined with the development of political unrest and upheaval  in Pakistan. Malala's story epitomizes  the struggle between good and evil. Most striking is the evil that is done in the name of god, the corruption and fear that promotes it, and the triumph of courage  and true faith in the end. This is not a book you can easily put down, even though the ending is known. There are times where the honesty and the content in the book  is almost painfully raw. It is a must- read, and a testament to the power of one voice to change the world.
B0001XAOL6|5.0|WOW!!! I watched it twice (I was too tired the 1st time and it happens to be a almost 3 hour movie)and I will watch it a third time with Family members. Performance of Will Smith as Muhammad Ali, I would have to say dead on/awesome.
1416968725|4.0|super cute book my 3 year old can almost read all by himself. lovely watercolor illustrations. fun way to teach about different animals and their offspring
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because I love the hungergames series I just really wanted to reread it I did reread catching fire before I did hungergames and I just need to reread mockingjay.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Loved this game as a kid. Still great to play only better. Love the graphics<br />And the goals you have to do.no problems playing the game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun, and i love playing this when i cant go to bed it makes me stay awake and when my battery dies i just go to bed and wait until the morning.LOVE THIS GAME !!! everyone should get this game
B009EAO38C|5.0|What I love here is the creative arrangements without the synthesized cheesiness inherent in Mannheim Steamroller pieces.  My selection for best Christmas album of 2013.  These guys are amazing and well worth your acoustic dollars.
B000TEVIMQ|5.0|Love Tull? Then you will love this compilation. Sure, you could add songs, but you can always add songs to a greatest hits album for a band with so many great hits.  :-)  I also love that I get the physical CD and Amazon gives me the option to download a digital copy as well.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I just loved this movie...intrigue, suspense, action, wonderful entertainment.  The illusions performed by the magicians were so very creative...just kept me guessing how they did it the whole way through...wonderful cast, storyline, and direction.  A must see whether you like magic or not!
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I don't like this watch. I expected to not like the band, and didn't, but accepted that going in (I don't like bands that you have to buckle, I prefer the velcro bands, and replaced that), so that does not really affect the rating. What I don't like about this watch is that I find it to not keep accurate time. I understand that if you don't wear it every day it will stop (duh, it is self-winding based on arm motion). But when I wear it every day and it does not stop, I would still find it off by 5 minutes per week! That's just too inaccurate for me. Maybe you will not mind that, but I did. I like to be on time for appointments...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone it even made me cry when I Was done with the series so I just read the series over and over again I wish she would make more books her books are the best books ever and I chosse that rating because I thought the books were excellent
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Excellent book by someone with trustworthy credentials to help turn around America's mental and neurological health issues.  A must read for anyone wanting to stay sharp as they age or help children with learning difficulties.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|A very good game. Starts simple but gets increasingly more complex as new components are added. The concept is simple and easily understood but it is used to very good effect. A very enjoyable game. I will purchase more from this software house.
0061992860|5.0|fantastic tiny little book - well designed and well organized! - be ready for the end of the world and learn outdoor skills
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This was an absolutely AMAZING book.  Full of suspense, action, but still a bit of worry and sadness followed most of it.  I have no troubles at all rating this book a full 5 stars, and would strongly recommend the book to people 8+.
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|An ok movie with very conservative 3D.  I believe this was a stereo conversion, and they definitely did not go bold with it.  But otherwise a beautiful look.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|can't get enough of this show, we own all 4 seasons on DVD and can't wait for the current season (season 5) that is on television now to come out on DVD so we can watch and re-watch the episodes like our family does now with the first 4 seasons. if you haven't seen this show, you must, it's hilarious one of the best shows on television ever! :)
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|An interesting read that serves as a cautionary message about the power of the Internet.  A &#34;1984&#34; for our times.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The author is a master story teller who holds the reader's attention on every page.  The story of two brave intelligent women who somehow cope with unimaginable tragedy,abuse, and loss and yet hold on to hope<br />in the most dire of circumstances.  A compelling picture of the lives of ordinary people in the midst of serial wars waged by Russia, Afghan war lords, the Taliban and finally the Americans.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Love this extended edition! Everything you wanted--extra scenes, hours and hours of bonus footage. Even the box is designed to mimic the Lord of the Rings extended edition boxes. :)
B00G32QIEG|1.0|This is like one horrible cartoon, except it has actual actors, and not animations. DO NOT EVEN RENT! I can not believe how bad this movie is!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game has a lot of great features and awesome characters. its one of my new favorite games<br />I suggest that if you loved the movie you definetely need to get the game
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is great for videos and photos i am giving this opinion to unlock a theme but i think you should get this app
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I've read all his books to date and liked them all. Such a pleasant read. A book I didn't really want to end.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have no complaints. It does what it's supposed to do well. There are plenty of sounds to choose from and good timing options. I haven't found any major bugs this release.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Can only give this 3 stars because it asked for a rating after only two levels. Not bad so far<br />though
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|When our troubled world stops making sense, listen to this CD.  Everything he sings is a spiritual.  Saw him live - an interesting person lives behind the music.
B00ELAMR60|2.0|I am one of those people who are quite happy to buy these 'Deluxe Editions' for the extras each one contains, even thought I already have the main disc (sometimes several times). It would be nice if the record companies sold these extra discs separately, but they don't. They like to make money by making you pay for 2 CDs. That's life.<br />Anyway, this one caught my eye before release as it was advertised as containing an extra CD of live 1969 recordings, so I ordered it before release.. On receiving the CD, it says on the back, for the second disc 'All tracks recorded live at various shows during the autumn of 1969'. Upon listening, a few tracks stood out with completely different sound and vocals. Stumbling across the Who official website the other day, they now tell us that three tracks are actually recorded in Swansea in 1976. Sorry, that's disgraceful. The package of the CD clearly states 'ALL recorded during 1969', and the booklet has no mention whatsoever of the extra live CD. That for me is blatant misrepresentation. Even the Amazon site lists all tracks as live 1969 in Ottawa.<br />Anyway, the live tracks (those that are from 1969) are great. Goes nicely with the live versions they released from Hull, Leeds and the Isle of Wight.  I just wish this was all 1969. (Not 1976 disguised as 1969)<br />The main disc 'Tommy' sounds pretty much like the other versions I have on CD, released in 1996 and 2003.<br />5 stars for the music. 0 stars for honesty with their fans.<br />Oh, and the Who are now letting us download two 'newly found' tracks from 1969 from their website to replace two of the 1976 tracks. But they are mp3 format. Kind of defeats the purpose of 'remastered', in my opinion.

This one blew me away and had me hanging on the edge. The ending was perfect. I totally loved it. Tom Cruise still has it.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a terrific story ! I don't read a lot but my book club was reading this and I'm glad they were. Not only a story that will have you turning those pages as fast as you can but it deals with quadriplegic issues and a look into their lives. Get it! You won't be disappointed!!
B001D8W7CW|3.0|I thought Carrie was overrated. People say it was the best, maybe for its time back in 1979. But nowadays it was a little corny for me. I'm so used to seeing Newer Movies but it was nice to see movies that are older than me. Still enjoyed watching it, though.

B008JFUO72|2.0|Ok, I know you see two stars and you think &#34;he's an Iron Man hater!&#34; NOT TRUE!! I love love loved the Iron Man movies! the First one was hilarious, action packed, great story line, the second was as well! Avengers was my favorite, Tony Stark back with his hilariously arrogant and 'I'm invincible' attitude. The Avengers was probably the best action thriller I have seen in years (maybe even my whole life!). SO you can imagine, I was VERY excited for Iron Man 3 to come out. Until I saw it in theaters.<br /><br />THE ACTION WAS GREAT. *BUT*, Tony Stark was portrayed in this movie as a post-traumatic stress victim and spends most of the movie getting beat up with his tail between his legs. This is not at all like the way I picture Tony Stark. He's supposed to be fearless, cocky, and impulsive! Then, his suits get destroyed left and right by every minor villain that comes his way. In the first movie, a fighter jet crashed into his suit and THE JET was the one that got wrecked, not the suit! In this movie, he goes through about 30 different suits, and all of them get destroyed in disappointing ways.<br /><br />THE PLOT WAS QUESTIONABLE. Tony, in his stressed-out state, gets rescued multiple times by other people who have zero qualifications to rescue THE HERO OF THE MOVIE. For instance, there is an EXTREMELY cheesy part of the movie where Pepper Potts arms jumps into the air, and arms herself with part of tony's suit, then goes commando (literally, she's busting out ninja moves and fighting techniques) and single-handedly, in about 5 seconds, defeats the bad guy that HAS BEEN BEATING UP ON TONY STARK THE<br />E-N-T-I-R-E  MOVIE!<br /><br />THE BAD GUYS WERE REALLY CHEESY. Granted that the background of the villain is pretty well thought-out, the villains being fire-breathing &#34;Johhny Storm&#34; wannabees, are extremely cheesy. They were next to invincible, while the iron man suits were getting wrecked by the dozen, by Less Than Formidable opponents.<br /><br />THE MAJORITY OF THE MOVIE IS THE GOOD GUY GETTING BEAT UP, AND GOING THROUGH A CRISIS. I don't know if this has become a trend lately, but Batman followed the trend (in the last movie), so did Superman(in the new man-of-steel movie), and so did Wolverine (in his new chinese movie). All the latest/last movies in the series show the hero incapable/decrepit and getting beat up left and right by the bad guys. Don't get me wrong, but isn't it supposed to be the other way around???<br /><br />All in all, I was extremely dissappointed in this movie, and personally prefer to exclude it from my DVD collection and pretend that the avengers was the last Iron Man movie. The action was great, but I wasn't a fan of the story.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Graphics are awesome but it is slow loading. I think it is definitely better than earlier editions,  animals are cooler
B005LAIIGW|1.0|IF YOU SAW THE PREVIEW AND THOUGHT IT LOOKED DUMB, DON'T PAY FOR THE MOVIE. by all means, if you get to watch it for free, great; but otherwise, don't waste your time or money! I thought the preview looked dumb. And my wife thought it was going to be an awesome movie. So we went to go see it with another couple. I FELL ASLEEP IN THE THEATER!!!!!! This movie appeals to the scared of heights, opposite of claustrophobic (scared of open spaces) type person. I remember the scary music blaring on screen and me laughing upon realizing that I was nodding off! If your scared of outer space, or being stranded, by all means, your probably going to love the movie. If not, its gonna be lame. Sandra bullock spends the entire movie (except for the first few minutes) alone, so you get no interaction with other people. It was just boring. plain and simple.

0061339202|3.0|I think this guy could have done with a writer partner or even a ghost writer.  Once you understand the main theory in the first 50 or so pages, the book becomes a jumbled mess, as many other reviewers stated.  The author goes out of his way to rename standard mental functions like attention (psychic energy) and distraction (psychic entropy) that doesn't really facilitate better understanding of the material, especially when there is no index.<br /><br />The author really seems to have issues applying his own theory in a usefull way for the general populous.  Some half-hearted references to yoga, zen, religious ritual and the meaning of life are made, but are barely tied into practical use of the theory, if at all.  Any time religion is mentioned, it's with an intellectually elitist air, stating over and over that all it does is impose artificial order in an uncaring universe and really is just flow in action, without taking the full philosophical and cultural contex into account.<br /><br />The book was so unorganized, I left wondering about the validity of the theory itself. At one point, he rambled about sight as a flow mechanism and earlier states reading, seeing performances and conversing with friends are flow activities, but constantly states that TV is mind poison. That seems unfair. He makes some references to zen as flow, but zen is about the release from the self and goals, those being the pillars of flow. He states you must continuously advance to harder environments for flow, but quotes an old woman who enjoys milking cows- hardly an increasingly difficult task after decades of experience.<br /><br />Overall, I found the concept of Flow sort of obvious.  The only thing I really took away was the necessity for focus, realistic goals and the ability to challenge yourself. It gets 3 stars for the helpful reminder in a world of cheap, easy pleasures and if it helps some people who didn't honestly know that, more power to it?
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Interesting story with lots of insight into the failing prison system and the women prisoners' chance of a successful life after prison and the challenges in prison.

0440245915|5.0|&#34;A Time to Kill&#34; is one of John Grisham's very best novels.  It is his earliest and a fine beginning to a series of legal mysteries that captivates the reader.  It takes place in rural Mississippi, and surrounds the brutal assault on a young black girl by two rednecks.  The trial and intrigue are unbeatable, and the story of the defense attorney, Jake Brigance, will pry at one's emotions to the hilt.  It is impossible to outguess the rapid read and the pages will turn reflexively.  This should be made into one of his films, and with more reviews like this it just may.  Dale Blair Haufrect

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|&#34;Sometimes a duck is just a duck.&#34; This quote from later on in the novel concisely describes the no-nonsense tone employed. Palacio puts on no airs as she narrates the life of Auggie from several different perspectives. The diction is clear and concrete, which is appropriate for a young reader of about 8 to 12. There are also colloquial expressions kids that age would recognize.<br /><br />The varying points of view is what lends this novel its charm. It is sprinkled with innocent childhood impressions that are recognizable by the audience. Had it been from one perspective it would have lacked depth.<br /><br />The part narrated by Justin is probably the weakest, with the lower-case punctuation being rather contrived in my opinion.<br /><br />However, it is a marvellous read, lending credence to the idea that people are motivated by different things, acting, crying and laughing for different reasons. Auggie does well to overcome his angst.<br /><br />Finally, this novel is humorous, which makes it a joy to read for anybody.

B008LXZFH6|4.0|Absurdist low budget comedy with tons of improvisation and Steve Carell and Will Ferrell are two of the funnier human beings at it.  And whoever decided that \\"jazz flute\\" was a thing to make fun of struck comedy gold.

This album is clean, a great listen, and deserves much love.  There are portions of this album that send chills down my spine.  The guitar layerings put together with patented AIC harmonies are fantastic.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Great album & if you've not purchased it because Layne isn't on it, well, you're doing yourself a big disservice.

0062107313|4.0|In her first novel in nine years, Amy Tan once again tackles the complex relationship between mothers and daughters. It begins in Shanghai in 1918, when the sheltered life of Violet Minturn is about to undergo an exceptional transformation. Violet is the daughter of Lucia Minturn, an American who came to China at the turn of the century and eventually established one of the more unique houses of pleasure in the city. More than just a courtesan house, Lucia has established a nexus of social contacts between Chinese and Western businessmen where they can meet and drink among the Chinese &#34;flowers&#34; and where the word in the ear of one of the clients can catalyze a huge business deal.<br /><br />As the rebellion against the Ching dynasty occurs and conditions deteriorate, the Western community decides to abandon the settlement and Lucia makes her own departure plans to leave Shanghai and return to her native California. She works her contacts to secure scarce passage space for herself and Violet and one of her Western clients, an aptly named Fairweather, steps forward to procure space for them, once Lucia provides bribe money for the &#34;booking agents.&#34;<br /><br />What happens is a huge betrayal. Mother and daughter are separated with promise to be reunited onboard due to the turmoil in the streets to reach the ship. Lucia arrives at the boat just as it is about to set sail but Violet is not aboard. Instead Fairweather has sold her to another courtesan house under the protection of one of the local gangs as a &#34;virgin courtesan&#34;. And the tale is off and unspools like silk thread.<br /><br />What has been visited on the mother is reenacted with twists on the daughter. Love, struggle, bitter endurance and a measure of peace and eventual reconciliation are reached. It's the multigenerational, transpacific sweep of story we've grown to expect from Ms. Tan and she once  again delivers.  The principal characters are fully realized and you're engaged to keep turning that page to find out what happens to them next. While not quite as gripping as I remember The Joy Luck Club being, it is nonetheless an captivating read. And at 589 pages, a tale that you can savor for awhile.p turning that page to find out what happens to them next.

They have this ultra super powerful homing beam, but they don't have a laser gun (or a beebee gun), just a fancy sword.  Also, you could see how the story goes a mile away.  Zero surprises, except one that makes no sense at all. Will Smith wrote it.  He should've gotten a consultant.

B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Musical preference is a very personal choice and few reviews can totally respond to one's personal preferences. For those who are only minimally familiar with Jonathan and Charlotte, they made a sudden impact a year and a half ago on &#34;Britain's Got Talent&#34; which is hosted by Simon Cowell on ITV. The pair walked on stage with Jonathan wearing a Jimmy Hendrix tee shirt and long black hair which almost covered his face. Charlotte was dressed very nicely and did most of the talking. Jonathan was shy 17 year old as a counterpoint to 16 year old Charlotte's simple but graceful introduction. By the time they began their song, the audience was rolling their eyes and already waiting for the next act. That lasted until Jonathan opened his mouth and blew the audience out of their seats with a majestic baritone/tenor voice full of energy and excitement. When their song was over, Jonathan was biting his fist and Charlotte was relieved that the ordeal was over. The audience and the judges were standing and giving them a long round of applause. If interested, check out their audition on You Tube, which has received well over 30 million views.<br /><br />A year ago, they released their well received first album, &#34;Together.&#34; It was obviously a hurriedly assembled album to build on their success on BGT. But &#34;Together&#34; still showcased Jonathan's big voice while also showing more of Charlotte's lyric soprano voice. It is still full of the energy and excitement of their audition performance.<br /><br />Now, a year later, they have just released their second album, &#34;Perhaps Love.&#34; So far, the people who love it, are even more in love with it. People who are looking for the earlier excitement tend to be a little more disappointed. The truth is, both of these young people have grown both age wise but also as performers. Jonathan still can blow paint off the walls but he has also found a beautiful &#34;small&#34; voice that matches Charlotte's lyric voice wonderfully as shown in the title track and &#34;The Arms of an Angel.&#34; Their harmony is mature and a pleasure to listen to. In their duets, they blend and work together as a duo wonderfully. Each also has solos. With Jonathan you get what you want with a fine rendition of &#34;O Sole Mio.&#34; With Charlotte your see a nice lyric voice that almost reminds me of what Sarah Brightman would have been like at 17 or 18.<br /><br />Jonathan is usually labeled as an opera singer. He hasn't and as far as I know isn't studying opera. He has the vocal quality that you associate with the great opera baritone/tenors but he is unlikely going to go that direction. Rather I would expect him to develop a repertoire of popular and traditional songs that allow him to soar. Charlotte can only mature and could find a solid place in musical theater if there is room for a really nice, charming and talented woman. At the audition, Simon Cowell suggested that they should pursue things separately and many other speculate on that possibility. The truth is that their voices are very different but I personally think that the duets on this cd show that this side of them has great potential to develop also. I hope that they are allowed to follow this muse also.<br /><br />I hope that this background and my opinions help someone take the chance and give them a try. Personally, I taught in an alternative high school for ten years where students often had big dreams and little opportunity to achieve them. I respond very positively to people who step up and make the most of the opportunities that they get. Jonathan and Charlotte have taken their opportunity and run with it. I like their music; I love their potential. I can't wait for their third album next year to see how much more they have grown.
B00FA1DGIW|5.0|Word of Mouth is one of the best albums that came out this year <3 All of the songs are beautiful & worth listening to.
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|Love to love the remixes too ! thanks to Bruce, Giorgio and all the people who worked on this album
B00CC3KBAW|5.0|Here's an album that surprised me. The only other metal operas I'm used to are the ones by Avantasia, which are fantastic, by the way. But Tolkki does a fantastic job of creating short songs that pack a lot of punch. They not only have a lot of melody, but there's plenty of depth. And having the lead singer of Amaranthe prominent in most of the songs helps quite a bit! So if you're looking for something that's coherent yet has a bigger picture to the sound and lyrics, I suggest you give this one a try. If you're open-minded and you like melodic metal, you won't be disappointed!
B000QEIORG|5.0|What can you say about the foo fighters, probably one of the biggest rock bands today ! Their huge everyone loves them at least everyone I know ! But back I'm 1997 they were just putting out their second album and I had all but forgot about their first which ended being my close second of fav foo fighter albums but I always though it sounded to much like nirvana ( which Dave Grolh was the drummer for till the end of the band) . So it's 97 and I'm listening to the local alternative station at the time, and monkey wrench comes on and it's so fast, heavy and unbelievable catchy and sounded nothing like the foo fighters at the time. Needless to say it got my attention and I was like this is awesome who is this, couldn't believe it was the foo fighters. Now about the album: it's got everything to love about rock music for a rock fan, added eagles, and Beatles style melodies with sort of a power pop attack like cheap trick on steroids. Adding sort of a modern rock feel too it sounded like a million different bands all at once making something truly different in the rock world. Some songs remind me of helmet, the Melvin's, and nirvana playing eagles tunes. Or the pixies or even fugazi covering Beatles tunes in their own way! A classic rock album you have to hear. Still a rock classic today with a bunch of rock staples to this day on the radio!

B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Let me just say first I'm a huge comic book fan and collector love super hero movies and super heroes. There was a long gap between superman movies from superman vi to super returns.  Superman returns was a ok movie but a huge let down to me, I'm so glad they didn't continue with story line and actors. Then man steel came out with the producers of the dark knight trilogy ( Christopher Nolan) and the director of the watchmen, 300, and sucker punch ( sack Synder ) so all ready I'm sure it's going to be awesome. Well I finally see it and it was better than my wilder expectations. Let me just say this movie kicks ass and and is just plain awesome!  It's got sort of the same vibe as the dark knight movies which I think is awesome, I think the same composer of the dark knight trilogy did the score Hans Zimmerman. A great movie, I havnt walked out movie in along time and said that movie was awesome! Just a soon to be superman classic!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|A real challenge. There are rarely real exciting games that keeps you sharp throughout but this is one of the best.
0739376969|5.0|Fascinating and easy to read researched ideas to help plan and succeed with needed changes personal, team, partnerships.  Have shared this book with many others!  So many that I don't have  a hard copy anymore only the electronic one.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this app for my younger cousins and they loved it! They didn't want to put it down and the animals they got were just adorable. It's a cute little game that passes the time but you do need a lot of space in order to play and care for all the animals you get.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I've been waiting for some time to see Terraria on the Amazon store! The controls take some getting used to. This tablet version has two joysticks at each bottom corner. One to control movement and the other for mining direction.<br />I highly recommend if you enjoyed minecraft or games where you can explore and craft items. Creativity.
B00005J9PB|3.0|The  DVD must be old or copied as it would not play on today's devices (blue ray, dvd player, or new laptop) .  It was able to play on an older computer.  This was the 2nd one we ordered, the first one we sent back, it wouldn't play on any of the devices (even the older computer).
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Loved the picture, had great comedy appeal and everyone can use a good laugh these days. Nicolas Cage was great in the role as Pa Crood and that baby, heheheheheh I am still laughing. This is one of those films you have to watch over and over again.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Appreciate the research. On to more of her books.  Most sensible recount of Richard III reign.  Great character development. Bravo
B006R1T40I|5.0|Her best yet. Her choice of songs is great. She is one of the best slide guitarists. Very emotional singing & playing.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook can be really weird; sometimes I am following along with someone and all of a sudden their posts don't show up for awhile.  Then they resume.  And I am not fond of the privacy stipulations.  On the other hand, it is a good place to try to stay connected with family and friends who are far away.  I stay with it because there isn't another great option out there yet but I bet there will be in the future.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|this was a very good book. it kept me wanting to find out what would happen next between these love teens and the action is just the right amount as well.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|In the \\"Product Details,\\" it shows the language as: English Dolby Digital 5.1.<br /><br />Yet at Blu-ray.com [...] it shows: Audio English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1<br /><br />This is worth knowing to those who have a 7.1 system, which produces, even for someone with hearing as bad as mine, much better sound immersion -- depth, clarity, etc.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A great read for a John Grisham fan. The twists in the story give light to a terrible part of our American history.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Somw of Grisham's mre recent books have failed to meet up with the standard he set with his early novels, but &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; changes that trend! Good story, good character building.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|Great earlier album with just the right  blend of punk and good ol' rock n' roll. If only they maintained some of the angst.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham delivers another classic. You will be riveted by the pace of this novel. Once again, we are forced to wait for the next book. Hurry, Mr. Grisham , we can't wait
B005IDXIL2|5.0|Definitely my favorite bowling game by far!  I've tried a few for my Kindle and this one seems to send the ball where I actually aim. The others seemed to have &#34;slick&#34; spots and would shoot me into the gutter....  I love that it challenges you to continue to beat your high score in order to unlock new types of balls.
1595827684|4.0|Mostly excellent, though it doesn't cite the artists and can be a touch skimpy on Mass Effect 3 material.  Just a touch.  Still, perfect coffee-table book for the fans of this brilliant franchise.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|I detest when movies have effects so loud your ears ring because you have to have the volume so high just to hear the people speaking. Once the ringing in my ears went away I kept waiting for something to interest me. There were moments that I enjoyed but it was hard to get past Jeff Bridges mouth full of something when he was talking. This is one that I wish I would have waited to watch when it is a free choice. So disappointing when the previews made it look so entertaining.
1608871045|5.0|This is the ultimate The Dark Knight book for all the fans. It has both information and unique things, like the map of Gotham, Tumbler and Bat plans, cave plan, detailed description of suits an weapons, and things like Joker's cards etc. It is really like a piece of a movie by itself. That book makes you feel a part of the story.
B00F91H15W|4.0|hilarious ridiculous obnoxious movie. but it was funny and entertaning so that was well worth it lol. got a good laugh with the friends
B004TI5N38|5.0|Suspence and surprise made it hard to put down.  The character Puller, however, was a bit too good to believe and a little too macho
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even know how to say how good it is. Is a twist and turn of emotions. This is a have to read.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Interesting game, fairly good, not exactly the type of puzzle game that keeps me fascinated for a long time, but definitely one I will come back to when I have a few random moments. Honestly, I think I am using the star system properly, I Like It, I just don't Love It!! Seems confusing at first, but between the tutorial and the first puzzle, it became pretty clear by the time I finished the first puzzle. The blurb  for this game states the ZOO Hexlogic free was included for free, but I am not seeing where that happens, anyone know?
B007PVHANM|5.0|Bob Marley was an artist whose work will also stand above the pack.  This is a great film honoring the man and is definitely a must-see.  It does make you feel good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's an excellent game with a way to make you think for a solution at different  levels. Wish we had more opportunities instead of being time bound
B0069UP2PI|2.0|This isn't really an enjoyable film to see during flu season.  On second thought, this isn't really that enjoyable a film.  That would be okay if it could be called as meaningful film, but again, it fails that classification.  All in all, I advise to avoic this film like you'd avoid a contagious disease.
B000063Y8F|5.0|The best garlic press available. It crunches whole cloves thoroughly and fast while being easy to clean. We love our press and bought this one as a house warming gift for friends. Rosle also makes a terrific can opener.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|One of Woody's best films, this also establishes Owe Wilson as a serious comedy star.  This is a magical film and one to be seen again and again.
B002NZV68U|1.0|This movie was terrible. I really like Johnny Depp but this was just awful. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka was not endearing at all (as the original character was intended to be) instead he was just plain creepy. The grandpa and the kid who plays Charlie on the other hand were really good in this film. Over all though it was a creepfest don't buy it
B0059XTTW8|5.0|This has become my favorite John Le Carre movie.  I can't understand the number of bad reviews.  True, the author isn't for everyone, but this is a well mounted film with superior acting and cinematography.  Highly recommended.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|was not a great movie. I wasn't impressed at all with the story line or jokes. It was boring and not what I was hoping for. My kids lost interest about half way through too and they love movies
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This is a great combo of action thriller with, would you believe, artiness.  This is bound to go down as one of Ryan Gosling's best films.  It's worth rewatching, for sure.
B00BUVPIRS|2.0|THIS GAME IS TOO HARD! The enemies are way to hard to kill at the end and this game is very frustrating. It has good graphics but Is way to hard.
0547791097|5.0|A good book to prepare you for the movie, this is very much a good read.  It's short and it's quick and it's exciting.  If you like action with some depth, you have it here.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It really fun because  you just type something in it gives it to you and you get to play with it
B005HP2J66|5.0|You'll find everything you'd expect in a Herzog film here.  It's soulful and it's deep.  It's one you absolutely must see.  You think the man came out with beautiful films before, just go to see this one.
B000P1QMZ6|4.0|A classic film from a seies that got better with each chapter. This a a replacement for our VHS copy.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This was one of my most anticipated movies and I wasn't the least bit disappointed by it.  Spielberg is at his best, and all aspects of the film were top drawer.  Most highly recommended.
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|Great dance music album! This album seems to grow on me the more I hear it. Think it will be in the rotation for a very long time.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One must see this if one gets any enjoyment out of the Marvel universe at all.  This is first class enjoyment and should appeal to all ages.  Don't dismiss it as just another comics film.  It's solid entertainment for young and old alike.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just found that it was available for KF and thought, YEA, NOW I CAN PLAY IT BIGGER!! that's  just sad LOL
B001HN6922|2.0|I liked the series when it started, but it has deteriorated.  I think the original idea has worn out its course and it's time for Disney to progress to new material.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Excellent! 4 discs, multiple subtitles effect is very exciting! Hope to be able to launch more movies with Chinese subtitles.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Sci=fi and war film devotees will find lots to enjoy here.  It's fairly routine, but does keep one watching all the way through.  Women may be impatient with this.  It's pretty much a guy's film, and the battle scenes will especially appeal to older guys.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I enjoy a good time in the battles and glory days after a few victories.<br />What I'm saying is the game is Fire.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|The authorship of Shakespeare's plays is the subject of unending debate.  This is a vastly superior film that tackles the question and it is worth seeing whether you really care who wrote the plays or not.  Highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Wow. This book was everything I hoped it would be. I will never look at steam coming out of someone's  mouth the same way again. Stephen king never fails to give me new nightmares.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This film has surprised many who didn't expect to like it.  It is good and it is definitely a fresh view of the old franchise.  The author of the original book couold have had no concept of what his book would eventually inspire.  Highly recommended.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|So glad I found this new, still packaged, for such a great price. I'm giving it to a friend for her birthday, this should make her very happy, thank you!
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This is truly an enjoyable rock'n roll movie.  Tom Cruise moses it well, and there's lots of music for rock fans to enjoy.  There's no real depth here, but fans will be sure to enjoy this one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My guess is that many OSC fans, myself included, expected to be very disappointed by the 2013 movie ... actually, even though the movie strayed a bit and omitted way too much of the book, giving the movie a very compressed feel, it was still a decent effort ... for me, no feeling of having wasted my time watching the movie ... basically, Ender's Game is such a great book that even a movie version can not totally ruin it.<br /><br />My wish is that the director had made the movie longer and/or in two or more parts ... the first part of Ender's Game is just as important, if not more so, than the point at which the movie begins.<br /><br />Read the book, even if you have already seen the movie ... if you had lots of empathy for Ender in the movie version, you will have even more for him when you read the novel.<br /><br />Both the book and the movie have some debateable plot holes ... in both, to some extent one also needs to suspend her/his disbelief.<br /><br />FWIW, if you like reading, chances are almost certain that you'll like reading Ender's Game ... if you like character development and growth, my bet is that you will also enjoy the next three books in the original Ender series.
B005FITIGO|5.0|This was one of 2011's notable financial crisis type films.  It's imminently watchable.  It did deserve more consideration for<br />awards.  It still holds up well after two years.
1480506974|1.0|1. Caution: it's mp3, not an audio cd, You play it on your computer, not in your car stereo.<br />2. Plus, or minus, the reader is not a great reader. I found it hard to listen to. Blah blah blah. This has not-that-much to do with the content of the material that he is reading. The book may be great. Oliver's production may be great. I do like to watch and listen to Oliver Stone. This is not that.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This is an unexpected improvement on the great Swedish film.  I wouldn't have believed that the original could be improved on.  David Fincher deserves credit for doing the improbable.
B009APMNB0|3.0|I used this device and software on 3 monitors. On the first monitor (my son-in-law's) he couldn't get it to work aftyer trying for about an hour. His wife checked the reviews and learned that the room might have had too much light (normal daylight coming in a window). It did work on the next two monitors, mine, but in each case I didn't like the results. Both of my monitors' color seemed slightly less bright and cooler. So I switched back to  my pre-calibration settings--on both. Fortinately the program gave me that option, and it was no trouble switching back, just a click did it.<br /><br />I can't say that if I did this on more monitors that the results would be the same--that is, no real improvement or results not as good as my monitors before I used this system.<br /><br />It'.s a great idea,  but I think this product needs work.<br /><br />I can't in all honesty recommend this product.
B008602KQI|5.0|So this is aimed at a teen audience, it's appeal is universal.  This is rather an unexpected film from the director of PLEASANTVILLE and SEABISCUIT, but it's definitely a winner.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|I didn't care for it...I didn't understand what the hoopla was about... It was very slow and after 15 min I turned it off
B006PTL1QM|5.0|Here you have depicted some of the greatest moments in psychoanalysis.  Marvelous performances as Freud and Jung are brought to life.  No, it's not for everyyone, but mature audiences will eat this one up.  Highly recommended.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|Very interesting and kept me engaged. Never really watched a lot of will smith movies but this was really good...recommend
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|It goes without saying that this is a film that should be seen in a theater.  It will still move you if you are reasonably mature and appreciative of artistic endeavors.  Highly recommended
B0098460O4|5.0|Goosebumps, that's what they give me.  Loved them on X-Factor and really enjoyed snobby Simon's surprised look when Jonathan began to sing.  Can listen to this album all day!
B007C3TVNA|5.0|This movie deserved a whole lot more attention than it received.  Tilda Swinton truly captured the essence of the mother here.  Ezra Miller was a chilling and completely convincing Kevin.  John C. Reilly was...well, he was John C. Reilly which is always good.  As for the plot, the less you know about it beforehand, the more you're likely to enjoy the movie.  Warning, it is a shocker.  Highly recommended.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Done it for 2 days & seeing the results already.<br />I am doing the 16 hour fast and drinking lemon water while fasting & so far handling ok.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|This is a well done JANE EYRE.  It could have been a bit more gothic for my tastes, but it's reasonably faithful to the classic story and is quite entertaining.  Recommended.
B00CGNYDIE|1.0|This game looked kind of intriguing and it was free today, so I gave it a shot. I breezed right through the first two levels without a single misclick. I literally don't even know what happens if you &quot;guess&quot; incorrectly. I never did, and I don't why you would. I don't mean to sound obnoxious or arrogant, and apologize if I do, but if you're good at minesweeper, I recommend passing on this game. It offers absolutely no challenge, and therefore, no entertainment either.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Don't expect gross horror here although it definitely has elements of ALIEN.  This is a movie to see and to discuss with others.  It has depth to it.  It will appeal more to the intellect than to the senses although there's plenty for both.  Recommended especially for mature sci-fi fans.
B005VMVUAQ|2.0|I am a fan of Nicolas Cage, but his acting in this film is VERY disappointing. As others have said, the film is a mess. Unfortunately, Nicolas Cage's acting does nothing to improve it.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This is a great film that never really caught fire.  It's sensitively acted and the writing absolutely great.  If you missed it, you missed something truly worth seeing.
0307476464|1.0|Somebody left this short story out and it went bad.<br />Afflicted with writer's gas, the bloating begins early on<br />and mushrooms until whole chapters read like clip shows.<br />The redundancy  [an echo chamber of manifold redundancy<br />on top of needless repetition followed by endless iterations<br />on the heels of  ... ]  gets so bad that he starts to repeat himself<br />within! single chapters.  What an offal mess.<br />With plot lines to nowhere and a double shot of lunacy, it's time<br />to consign this literary brick to the dustbin of history.
B005LAII62|3.0|Hey, if you like zombies and satires of zombie movies, you'll like this.  Advisability for  kid watching is up to the parent.  It's too strong for some kids while others will eat it up.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Excellent story- line. Depth.  You have to proceed page by page; you cannot anticipate the ending. Preston & Child are the best.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It's hard to believe that this has ended.  Now, we'll likely have a batch of tilms trying to be the next &#34;Harry Potter&#34; and it probably will be ten or twenty years before that happens.  We have had a fabulous period of fantasy film getting its due with both Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|If like family guy so being written by the same guy made it like a long episode of the show
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This wasn't the year's best film, but it was one of the better ones.  Tom Hanks wasn't quite at his best, but overall, it was a well done 9-11 film.  I do highly recommend it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This app has frustrated me to no end. Yet I keep playing it. I find it is also fun for the kids.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This definitely is the build-up to the conclusion of the series.  And this is bound to go down as one of the all time great fantasy series.
0321811984|3.0|The most useful info in the entire book can be summed up in 5 pages max, but he has stretched it to 229 pages. Most of the book is forced analogies...like there's a whole chapter called &#34;Learning from the art of Judo&#34; where he compares the five principles of Judo and how they are similar to making an effective presentation. He goes on to quote Judo experts from their books and ties it to zen principles and then tries to tie them to the art of presentation. *phew* Often, it's exhausting to even read. At several points in the book, you feel like saying &#34;Enough, get on with it dude!&#34;.<br /><br />The best part of the book was a couple of pages containing a collage of great slides. Just looking at those slides helps you learn, no words needed! If only he had added more pages like those, that would have added a ton more value. If those images are available on his blog, then you don't even need to buy this book. If they're not on his blog, buy this book (in paperback, not kindle because you need to see those slides in color)...despite the mountain of fluff, I learnt a lot from looking at images of some great slide presentations featured in the book.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|George Clooney gives one of his best performances in this.  It's a bit heartbreaking, but ultimately uplifting.  The Hawaiian background is well filmed and the story does move along well.  Recommended
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game! Fun to play, many different games and objectives to keep it exciting...also like how you can gift and trade collectibles with other players
B0034G4P94|5.0|This is a rip roaring film going to the inside of the world of martial arts.  It's definitely for fans and it may appeal to those on the outside that are less interested.  A good film to see.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|OMG!  Really?  Why is it so hard to make a good Superman movie?  The basic foundation already exists.  1 part Christopher Reeve, 1 part CGI special effects that are now available to make a kick butt film, a dash more action and a hotter Lois Lane and you got yourself the best Superman movie ever!  I'm puzzled why such a great property like Superman is so hard to reboot on the silver screen.  Superman Returns, ugh, enough has been said about that one.  I was pinning all my hopes on Man of Steel and was tragically disappointed.  Henry Cavill is totally buffed and the movie has alot of special effects, but everything else was missing.  Being an older film viewer, I was hoping to see the &#34;Golly Gee&#34; factor that was evident in the Christopher Reeve Superman movie.  People were amazed to see a man fly, they oohed and aahed when he swooped down and saved a cat out of a tree, they cheered when he rescued a lady falling from a building and they saluted when he vowed to fight for truth, justice and the American way.  He was tall, muscular and imposing, yet a sensitive and caring superhero.  Unfortunately, The Man of Steel is a completely different creature.  Firstly, the whole Krypton scene was just trash.  They made it WAY TOO long and complicated then it needed to be, which subtracted from more Clark Kent / Superman scenes.  All that weird Kryptonian cloning, genetic engineering, political battle scenes in Man of Steel was unnecessary.  What happened to the simple scene of the caring alien husband/ father/ scientist clinging to his loving wife, with tears and hope in their eye, as their world crumbled around them, while their son rockets to another world?  That's all you really needed, it spoke volumes.  Even the adoptive parents, the Kents, are kind of strange and stilted in this film.  It makes you yearn for Glen Ford and Phyllis Thaxter with their loving and poignant portrayal of parent's who adopt an extraterrestrial savior.  And you know what?  For all the dazzling special effect, can they just slow it down so you can watch Superman fly.  I really think some of the best scenes in a Superman movie is watching him lift off and flying around the city.  Not all the sudden bursts and blurring backgrounds that look like he's caught in a tornado.  Maybe The Man of Steel represents the kind of film people like today.  I still see in my minds eye a Superman movie with a wiser, more innocent hero, patrolling Metropolis in the air, taking time to wave at a little child looking up at him in awe.ling special effect, can they just slow it down so you can watch Superman fly.

B00005R87Q|5.0|This defines the phrase, &#34;guilty pleasure&#34;.  I don't know many who want to actually admit they enjoy these potboilers, but it does boil down the the fact that they're great fun.  My better tast6e says these are trashy, but my senses say &#34;relax and enjoy&#34;.
0316067601|3.0|First I just want to say that I respect Mr. Luttrell, and the many other men and women who serve in our arm forces, but with that being said, this book was hit-or-miss for me, and parts of it painted a picture more like an over-dramatic a war movie than anything else; the intermittent propaganda didn't help either. Still, if you're interested in military memoirs this isn't a bad read, and it can be real inspirational at times.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I generally am resentful of take-offs of Dickens, and especially of A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  However, this is a classic in a class all by itself.  &#34;nuff said.
B00CHIMG6Y|2.0|Good story line... poor script from about 3/4 of the way through the film to the end.  Would not watch this again.
B00782O7IY|5.0|This is one great film from the ironic first scene to the end.  It's silent, of course, until the last scene.  And it's a great homage to the silent era.  It definitely deserves all the awards given it.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Really did not care for the story line from an &#34;entertainment&#34; point of view. My husband watched it all the way though.  He also would not watch it again.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is bound to take its place as one of the superior baseball movies of all time.  It will even entertain those with not interest in the game.  Highly recommended.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|I've never been good at geography and so thought this might help me learn. It definitely met my expectations and surpassed them by making a game out of learning.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie is simply indescribable.  It was one of the best of its year and deserved more awards than it received.  It' has an unique humor to it and in its way is quite touching.  Do yourself a favor and see this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging enough to be fun, but not to challenging that you give. Simple entertainment for a relaxing night with wine.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day and I can see myself buying the other ones.  Instantly hooked.  It's 100% logic.  If you like Picross, you will like this.  Tons of content.  I was making it through the easy ones (three levels of around 20 puzzles each) and tried a hard one and I could not get through it so went back to finish off the easy ones then off to medium.<br /><br />Tip:  You can select multiple squares at a time if they are all going to be painted the same color.<br /><br />Also:  There's a setting to turn off the background picture.  I found it a lot easier to see the board this way.<br /><br />Tip #3:  Double tap a square to select all the squares around it.<br /><br />Tip #4:  Tap and hold a square to magnify it.  I can see them just fine but it's just for the cool factor :)<br /><br />Edit:  I hate hate hate hate this game.  The FIRST puzzle of the Hard difficulty is just about impossible to solve lol<br /><br />This may be impossible to program, but here goes:  Is there a way to mark \\"Maybe\\" squares, like you can with Sudoku?  An extra button and a different way to show a color and you can Maybe a square with different colors.<br /><br />Another request:  Make one Hexlogic app and make all the different designs packages you can buy, that way it's all in one space on the screen and all your progress saved.  You can packages free if you want to for app of the day in the future.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Pretty good acting.  I would not have watched this movie if a friend had not recommended it.  It is basically an end of the world movie.  Pitt is the main character.  The story never really ends very well and leaves you wondering how we got side tracked.  Of course when the plot line is Zombies well....  I will say the Zombie thing is dealt with in away that makes it have some plausibility.  This is a take it or leave it movie.  I think there are better action movies to see before this one however.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|A real return to form.  I loved their first couple of albums but haven't connected yet with their last two.  I'm loving this one, though.  The band seems to be hitting their stride while also moving in some interesting new directions!
B00CHILW64|5.0|Excellent movie about grit and survival of a family caught up in the Thailand tsunami.  Based on a true story.  You already know the plot but the details of what they have to endure is the power of the movie.  Along the way they help others even thought they are struggling with their own losses showing the basic human trait of helping others in trouble.  Great actors doing a great job.  See it you won't be disappointed!
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Tremendous!  Daring and unique.  A very interesting evolution of the band's sound.  It's challenging and dense sometimes.  The more I listen the more amazed I am with it.
0316219266|5.0|Being in the industry it really was a good read.  I cannot comment on the authenticity of the content but can say that the themes are consistent with what we have experienced and the insights are great.  Jeff is a remarkable entrepreneur.
0143123173|5.0|Like a Spenser for the new West.  Taut story line, intriguing characters.  Can hardly wait to get the second title in the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its so amazing but few suggestions. Make an update that is like xbox.If you do that you'll be awesome. thanks :)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app. The metrics make it one of my most referenced applications throughout my day. Thanks guys for building a great program!
0316044695|5.0|Marcus's story make me feel like I was there right beside him.  A wonderful story that covers many deep emotions and gives a great insight to what our warriors need to do to survive in war.  I wish the media and our politicians could have been inserted along with his team in Operation Redwing to experience what his team experienced.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Very realistic racing and high graphics. You should get it and it's only 1 gigabyte. A lot of cars and 2014 cars included.
B004L35GAQ|3.0|I LOVE the song sail. It has such a great mix of sounds. Very imaginative. Most of the album is really good, just some songs seem off the wall. Worth trying
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Great for passing time. Good way to keep your brain busy. Easy to relax and enjoy.  Looking forward to playing again and again.
B00E95ED32|5.0|A wonderful mix of sounds. He has a talent well beyond any words I can write.  A note about Avicii is that he is very charitable towards global hunger.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Love this show! Though I have an annoying playback issue.  Maybe it's just my cheap DVD player, but when I select 'Play all,' all the chapters play back in a jumbled order.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I primarily listen to just two of her songs. I just can not seem to focus on the remaining songs. The two I enjoy are rolling in the deep and set fire to the rain. Very very powerful songs.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|great graphics. just getting started but I like it so far. there are a few glitches that make the game freeze up or stall but not bad enough to make me uninstall it yet.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I beyond love the drums in the song Radioactive. This group takes me back to the classic rock legends. Worth listening to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most fun game out there! So glad it finally came to Amazon Kindle! Some levels can be frustrating but most are just pure fun!!!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I didn't like this movie as much when I first watched it. I can't say how well it stands on its own in that regard. Because after watching Firefly and falling in LOVE, this movie was just much more of that. The characters are all great, and it delivers a satisfying resolution. I like Joss Whedon's The Avengers as much as the next guy, but obviously this is his masterpiece. Included with Firefly, it just sings.<br />I'm not one to really rate the technical aspects of bought movies. I turn to DVD talk for that reference. All that matters to me is the special features I end up watching, and the main attraction itself. I've seen this movie several times now, and to this day I may prefer it over watching something new, like most movies I know are great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this.  The colors are so brilliant.  I can't seem to get wet enough.  Best mobile entertainment.  I will recommend it to all my friends.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is an excellent read!  Grisham pulls at your heart strings in a meaningful way.  It opens one's mind to the pain many carry and reminds us to forgive even that which is not ours to carry.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Excellent insight into the world of ultra marathons and the benefits of a vegan diet for athletes. I loved how this book was a combination autobiography-recipe book. I can't express enough how enjoyable this was to read. He captured the emotions of crossing a finish line and genuinely described the struggles along the way from training to life hiccups.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Reflektor is better.  It is better than the Grammy winning Suburbs, better than Neon Bible, and better than anything else I have hear this year.  Not everyone will get it.  It is different.  But it is new, and fun to listen to.
B008JFUPPI|1.0|I can't understand how anyone could give this movie more than one star.  I would give this movie NO STARS if I could...or maybe even a NEGATIVE star!<br /><br />This movie, in a word, stinks.  I can not think of one good thing to say about it.  Okay, maybe Mary Louise Parker.  She's always interesting, for some reason.  But that's about it!<br /><br />Where do I begin?  You all know the premise:  Ryan Reynold's, a good cop, ends up dead and working for the RIPD (Rest in Peace Department).  He is partnered up with Jeff Bridge's character; a gruff gun slinging lawman from the 1800's.<br /><br />Their mission is to find and kill &#34;deados&#34;...bad dead guys who are hiding out on earth to avoid &#34;judgment.&#34;<br /><br />Okay.  This movie is supposed to be a comedy, right?  Then....where were the laughs?  This movie was not funny.  It was not funny in the least.  Yes, it felt a little like Men in Black...but without any of MIB's charm, humor, cleverness....or good character development!<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds as the main character is soooo bland!  Bland, bland, bland!  Nothing likable there at all.  And Jeff Bridge's character?  Well, I just found him irritating.  He's like a one trick pony.....always bringing up the past, and living up to his tough old west gunslinger clich&eacute; of an image.<br /><br />The two partners have fake i.d.s that determine how others see them.....Ryan Reynolds becomes a little old Chinese man, whereas Jeff Bridges becomes this (supposedly) hot blonde.  The so-called humor of these fake i.d.s is so juvenile!  Unless you are under the age of 17, you probably won't find this ongoing joke very amusing.<br /><br />The &#34;deados&#34; in this movie also have zero charm.....at least the aliens in Men in Black and the ghosts in Ghostbusters were FUNNY!  These creatures are just flat out rubbery looking messes.<br /><br />Wow.  I hate to be so negative.  I wish I could think of something good to say.  Well, the best thing that comes from me watching this movie is the ability to warn you NOT to!tching this movie is the ability to warn you NOT to!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Any girl who is a fan of The Hunger Games or The Divergent Series, will be awestruck by this series. Team Aspen or Team Prince? Don't ask me because I don't know.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is perfect for the kindle fire hd.  I spent what some might call too much time playing this game.  The controls are very easy to use, the only thing i have a problem with this app is that the control pad is a bit unusual to me, they work but I'm more accustomed to the joy stick, and call me picky but the lighting of torches are too dim during the day.
B00514HDNW|4.0|An interesting look into the psyche of man.  It kept me reading, even through the darkness of it.  I have to admit I was hoping for a happy ending, but I understand the choice not to give it one.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game needs an update because for the last two weeks I have not been able to get on for my kindle fire HD I really enjoy this game but am disappointed because I can not play it anymore
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|THIS GAME IS FUN AND GETS PRETTY CHALLENGING AND ADDICTING. The graphics are fun, bright and colorful. I suggest you give it a try. Unless your scared you will become addicted :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual city playground is a Cool city builder game, and I recommend it and you should try it out right now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Im glad there's finally a version for the kindle fire. Seems to be a fun game. the kids really like it also.
B009U9S6FI|1.0|Nothing like the original book I bought. No chapter divisions visible. Its one continuous and annoying foreword. I honestly feel like I've wasted my money buying this ebook. If it were possible to take back my money I would in a heartbeat because this is not what I expected at all.
0316055433|5.0|An existential bildungsroman; perfectly crafted characters, an obviously intimate<br />knowledge of the Author's mise-en-scenes, an all around enjoyable reading experience.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I like this game.decent graphics and just the whole concept of the game of how to line your cards so that u don't get took out
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Liked my simple clock without nonsense and no ads at the bottom.  Absolutely hate this one.  I want my first clock and alarm back.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Here is a treasury of Barbra Streisand's classic holiday musical recordings. Great listening for the first or 100th time. This CD truly puts Christmas in listeners' hearts and minds.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Finally another game other from real racing. I like its graphics its real likenesses and its multiplayer online so if you like racing don't go anywhere here it is
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The game is better (for me) than Castleville on fb because the game play is so streamlined. The quests rely on my game play instead of getting other players to send me things.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is a really good game. You can do whatever you want. Adventure,build. Really fun game.GET THE GAMES NOW. please get it
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I was very happy to learn that a new movie was coming in the series. The biggest issue other than the lack of John Carpenter is the confusion many have over the title. The film is a prequel to the original film of the same name. It is not a remake, it is not a sequel, and this confused many people who were not hardcore fans.<br /><br />The cast is good but nothing compared to the original and with the cat already out of the bag in terms of what the Alien is and what it is doing, the suspense factor is not as high as before.<br /><br />The film mixes practical and CGI FX and does bring some good entertainment.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|She has produced another terrific album, singing from the heart.  Her music is so easy to listen to on multiple levels--lyrics about her life, a beat to make you dance, and melodies to make you whistle or sing along.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What an amazing little device.  works interactively with youtube and netflix.  able to take whatever is on your current tab on chrome browser and plays it up on the tv screen
B0058YPILY|5.0|This was bought as a gift for someone who loves Criminal Minds.  I get each season for her and she loves them.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is amazing. I heard about it from Steve Gibson's podcast ' Security Now' where he recommended it.  I am very glad i watched it. super entertaining.
B008Y6WMEY|4.0|the Story was just Ok, but the character were great, I had some good laughs<br />especially with the scenes between Peter Seller and George C Scott
B005LW5J9O|5.0|As a former Latin pupil I thought I had a rather good knowledge about Roman philosophers. We read works by Seneca and Cicero in school, but not Lucretius. I remember the different philosophic viewpoints of Stoa and Epicureism, but I didn't expect to find them in this book, so I was positively surprised. I can recommend the book to anyone who is interested in an alternative approach to history.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Best book I've read in quite a while. One of the few that I really didn't want to end. Practically perfect.
B0085KGHI6|2.0|My feeling, watching Mick Jagger preening himself and pranceing around next to Muddy Waters, was that he was an embarresment, to himself and to Rock N Roll. He tried to upstage him, and by putting on the fake souther accent he tries to sing with, shaking his hair around like he is filming an add for head and shoulders shampoo- I felt sad for Muddy Waters. Someone like Springsteen or Dylan would have been completely respectful of their boyhood idols, but Mick Jagger is always worried about how he looks himself, like a concieted girl. He is more like  Madonna than he is Dylan or Springsteen. It made me feel that Mick Jagger was thinking this as he shared the stage: \\"This here bloke might be the authentic, real thing, and I may have gotten about a billion times richer and more famous than he is by ripping him off like I did, but hey, I am better looking than he is, and thats all that counts. He must feel lucky that I came here to share my fabulous fame with him. But its OK, because I will get 90% of whatever money comes in from this DVD, and he will get almost nothing, like before. After all, I am a rock star.\\"
B000OIZSVY|1.0|This is the second Kindle book sample I've downloaded this week, only to discover that the only preview material is the book's introduction.  We are considering adopting this book as a summer reading title for my AP English class, and I wanted to get a feel for what the book's text was like. This brief intro gives me absolutely no inkling of Truss's actual content. How can a reader make an informed buying decision based on this? Unfortunately, Amazon, your sample falls short of expectation ... again.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|I got this game 3 days ago and beat it but it was still fun as mess.<br /><br />Totally recommend this game to 8 and aboce.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|If I didn't already own this, I would buy it. Bought each year as it came out. I thought it ended too soon. And I definitely think it is time for a catch-up TV movie or six episode mini-series perhaps on Netflix. The writing was phenomenal. The acting was its equal but the joy, hope and verve of this show tells us how government should be. To me, this was appointment television. These days JUSTIFIED qualifies and HOUSE OF CARDS, little else I can't watch after recording it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't believe how addictive I am. It is challenging, frustrating and fun.  A negative would be no instructions how to make moves e.g. when flashing is that the best move or just a move.  Many reviews hate the time lifes but I need them to stop playing!  I don't like to pay so I try to complete the Quests, but admit to occasionally paying, justifying it as cheap entertainment.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addicting game. Fun...even if you do have to wait for lives to regenerate sometimes. Glad that it final came available for the Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i was so happy ehen i saw it on kindle fire FOR FREE yay finally i am sso happy its just like my i pod touch so the same like totally thank u candy crush makers let me get my saga on it is totally a five star yay
B008K8VDPU|5.0|i like this game alot i learned a whole bunch of new songs and now I can play the piano really good
B00A2YBDTQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the 1980's this is one the best 80's comedys I have ever watched were the spaceballs and all we do is dirty deeds even if your not from the 1980's I recomend you give this a chance anyway
B00C1C123E|5.0|Maybe this was better than the first. I think it was as the cast was quite good and the action was non-stop. I loved Jeff Goldblum and he is quite good carrying the lead in this film. The shoot in the van was truly terrifying, and the fact there are so many more dinosaurs just made it a real thriller.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Cute movie great for the kids or a family movie good to watch with your Girlfriend or wife pretty good movie fun story
B00FMF3R0I|1.0|Rip off.  This set costs about 5 bucks more than buying the two collections individually.  It adds nothing.  Get them individually and avoid this obvious attempt to separate you from your money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's a great book and I hope he makes a lot more I can't wait to know what happens next
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is fantastic!! It's free and it is the most professional tool I've ever seen and used!<br /><br />You will just have fun with this app and learn a new language as you go along the lessons. It is so rewarding and so well balanced. I love that even if you make a little mistake in writing it still says it is correct, but tells you what you did wrong.<br /><br />It is not pushing for anything, it is just rewarding everything you do!<br />And yes, learning a new language is a commitment. You forget to learn one day? The owl will send you an email to continue learning! This app is just amazing and keeps motivating me every day!!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE Christmas CD.  It has such a great variety of songs and of course, the style that Il Volo gives them is incredible.  Their voices are just made for songs such as these.  If you only have one Christmas album, make it this one!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This player is simple and does its job. Everything looks nice and works. Very convenient to switch to fast forward by just sliding over the screen! Love it!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Even funnier than Season 1!!  I spent a lot of time laughing. :D  I highly recommend this for family watching - the kids'll love the cute sheep and the adults will love the humor.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is just really nice to play! Not much challenging, but that's ok. The original was not so much either.
B004J4WKDI|4.0|Good book, very suitable for young people.  I bought it and read through and will probably give to my son for a good read
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Thing you should add to the game:<br /><br />Solar Panel : if connected to a fuelage or fuel tank it will make fuel<br />Fuel Line : will send fuel to other fuel tanks<br />Air Generator : uses empty fuelage *not fuel tanks* to make Fuel<br /><br />The part that will use Money!!!<br /><br />Scenario : uses money to buy stuff and more!
B004XW6AGO|4.0|I can't give a full rating of this book as yet as I am about half way through.  The plot is very interesting and makes for a very good read.  I bought a while ago but just too busy to read.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|All things move towards their which takes you back to the beginning. This is a recurring theme in King's work and something that resonates with my world view. King has done Danny a service by making him flesh in the follow up to The Shining. Danny must battle his own demons and hit rock bottom before he can grow and move on. When he settles down he finds that his past has caught up with him - the reach of the Overlook is long indeed.<br /><br />An excellent follow up novel I wish had been written years ago. Stephen King at his absolute best.
B00DNNQNW0|5.0|Not much can be said to criticize Katie's work.  She has a special voice and produces songs that seamlessly work with her superb singing quality.  If you are a Katie fan, here's another for your collection.  Absolutely no disappointment can be envisioned for her work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i really love it<br />it could have been a little better if they added where you can groom your hourse
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely a great book but then everyone says that don't they.  Definitely will read the series.  Keeps you on your toes at all times.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|For those who love diving deep into these machines Vs monsters odysseys, this is a blast.  You will be fighting all the way, like you were  there.  3D rules here.
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|I HATE this app so much!! I got it for the free app of the day but it's not worth free. This app is EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING!!!! When you get to a level the first thing you think is &quot;Wow this is going to be really easy! :)&quot;  BUT NOOO! When you throw the rock it goes the freaking WRING WAY!!!! DO NOT GETS THIS IF YOU DO YOUR AN IDIOT!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Totally addicted to this game!!! I have to fight my daughter for kindle time & am always wanting to complete my goals :)
B006MR2ZQC|4.0|This is a gift for my Grandson and he plays with Legos all the time!!  Since he is now into \\"superheroes\\" this should make a good Christmas present for him
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It's great to read a book that is not only a good story, but makes you laugh in every chapter.  And when you finally reach the end, you find yourself thinking this all could have actually happened.  I enjoyed the story I ordered 5 more copies to give as gifts for Christmas.
