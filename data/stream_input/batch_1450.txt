B0050VFRVG|5.0|This book was one of the best books I ever read! I was unable to put it down untill I finished it. I was hooked as soon as it started. If you love awesome books, I would highly recommend Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief to you.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Well it's finally here! The day all Marvel freaks have been waiting for...a decade has passed since we heard rumors that this titan team movie was in the works. The Avengers is without a doubt a complete success and for once lives up to the overwhelming hype.<br /><br />Not ignoring character development, The Avengers manages a pretty tough feat! The story is long, but never boring and even though it takes time to develop, it's like a simmering pot that we all know is going to explode at some point!..and when the pot does explode, it explodes like no other superhero movie has ever done!<br /><br />First off having Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Hawkeye, The Black Widow and Nick Fury in one movie seemed impossible to give each character their due, but The Avengers does just that,(Fury could have been better utilized and I can't get used to Jackson playing the part.) I grew up with the scruffy cigar chomping BADA$$ white guy version from the 60's), but this film pulls off the impossible! I never once looked at my watch in it's two hour and twenty five minute length. Besides having a very ambitious story the action sequences are the best I've ever seen in a film of this nature.<br /><br />The film has many comic moments which had the entire audience roaring with laughter with the Hulk (who is properly sized for once) delivering in spades this time around ( I guess they owed the character that much after two sub-par feature films). He and Robert Downey Jr. steal the show and give us those classic moments a popcorn film of this magnitude needs to keep everyone focused in on the fact that this is a film about comic book characters. Each character is given time to shine and having origin films for the main quadrant helps a great deal. I can't imagine how they're going to top this one?!<br /><br />The Avengers rivals the very best of all comic book films including Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins and the 3D (which I usually find distracting) is the best I've ever seen. Trailers for the new Spider Man reboot and Batman films were also presented in 3D. Even if you're not really into superhero films, this is the summer's must see movie. Get a tub of popcorn and prepare for an incredible movie experience!.... and you WILL want to stay ALL the way to the end of the film as there is a false ending showing one of Marvel's Heavy Weight Villains before a funny ending scene a few minutes later. I hope Marvel reboots the Fantastic Four with a CGI Thing that could at least give the Hulk a fair battle.seen. Trailers for the new Spider Man reboot and Batman films were also presented in 3D.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game. great time waster. some people will have a hard time because the later rounds require an actual strategy to beat.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|I've been waiting to see this movie for awhile. It did not disappoint. Very good direction, dialogue and acting. This is a superb story about a very difficult subject,  handled with sensitivity and intelligence. This will really mean a lot to those who are familiar with Freud's theory and how he and Jung collaborated and then split some seven years later before the beginning of WW1.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that makes you think and if you are familiar with the history of psychoanalysis, this is about as good as it gets. Freud and some of the people that he worked with were among the greatest thinkers ever. Jung, Adler, Otto Rank are in that group. Some of the occurrences presented are almost exactly as I remember reading about them many years ago. This is a classic confrontation between an analytical thinker (Freud) and a Intuitive thinker (Jung), both giants of intellect, but very human. These men were scientists, trying to dissect and understand the nature of reality and the essence of raw experience without psychic defenses or repressions. It could have destroyed them. Freud had more than one \\"fainting spell\\" and Jung had a nervous breakdown. It was indeed a \\"Dangerous Method\\".<br /><br />An important female character enters the picture but I'm not going to give more away about this movie.  I will say this, she may have understood everything, better than Freud or Jung. If you like this kind of subject you need to see this...Cronenberg is one of my favorite directors. So is David Lynch. You could say that Cronenberg is a very analytical and exact director whereas Lynch is more intuitive and mystical. That's the way I see it anyway. It's all very interesting...<br /><br />I just saw another movie recently that concerned events just prior to WW1. It is called the White Ribbon. I recommend both of these movies....

0547569653|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book- it was the motivation I needed in terms of exercise and diet right now (I'm a runner whose transitioning to vegetarianism). Here's the deal:<br /><br />The Good Stuff:<br />- Jurek is honest (I think) and divulges the details as they are necessary in regards to his upbringing, marriage, friendship and personal frustrations.<br />- He doesn't preach; I didn't feel like I was being persuaded to run ultras or become a vegan. He was simply describing what works for him. In this sense he is much more humble that some of his counterparts, including a man that has written many books...<br />- I felt that the book was nicely divided up; it was a book about how eating and personal relationships connected to his passion for running.<br />- I thought the recipes were a nice touch at the end of every section; not sure if I'll make them, but I enjoyed noticing the variety of ingredients he uses and his explanations as to why.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />- I really think this book is one for runners; those that don't \\"get\\" why people run would probably end up also not understanding Jurek.<br />- Don't expect to be a guide or a plan- its about his personal journey.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|A Matter of Honor is the first book I have read by this author. The beginning was slow, but once the story began to have alot of action, I could not put this book down. This is truly a great story. I will be reading more stories from this author.
B0016J81B4|2.0|I bought these for my boyfriend, who is a cook at a restaurant.  He wears them six to seven days a week, 10-12 hours/day, and he loves them.  He says they're light, comfortable and slip-resistant.  They're also very easy to keep clean.<br /><br />With less than a month of heavy kitchen use, the slip-resistant sole is separating from the bottom of the shoe.  Can't afford to buy a pair a month.  :)
0345803485|2.0|I read romance novels. This was my first novel of this nature. I didn't do a ton of resreach before buying. I assumed that my Amazon recommended list would take care of me. I read the entire thing but by the end had grown extremely tired of the sex scences. I \\"fast read\\" the last 3 chapters just to see if he agreed to \\"give more.\\" The characters seem shallow and not developed well. I understand the author is developing a story that can last three books but I needed to know a little bit more about the characters. At this point I am not sure if I will read the other two books.
B004N6369Y|5.0|To me, this was one of Danielle's best books - I enjoyed it. The story line held my interest right to the end.
0345529057|2.0|For decades I have passed on purchasing works by this author, solely for the reason of his use of the \\"R.R.\\" middle initials in his name.  That use struck me as being an affectation, as if the author was borrowing the credibility of another.  I suspected the author of being a mere poser.<br /><br />Then last year, I viewed the HBO series, and was intrigued.  I read up on the series, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".  Understanding that only five of seven projected books had been written, I decided to purchase those five, solely on the strength of the story telling that made up the HBO program.<br /><br />The first book was indeed as compelling as the TV series, as was the second.  The third began to ramble, as did the fourth even more; minor plot lines and characters stumbled around, as if the author had lost his way.  The fifth book was a bit more back on point, but my conclusion was ordained.  The author is indeed a poser. He introduces unnecessary characters and plot lines for the sole purpose of generating print... and presumably royalties. I do not doubt that if he could continue this \\"story\\" indefinately, he would do so. I wonder if he even yet knows where this story is headed.<br /><br />I will grant that the author is able to write compelling narrative, but he lacks complete vision.  Or he is a charlatan, trying to milk every penny he can from his reading public. Under no circumstance does this story require five volumes, let alone seven.  That other author whose name also contains the middle initials \\"R.R.\\" created a rich universe and told a complete story in three volumes; this author should have been able to do as much in four.<br /><br />I recommend that you do not purchase the books.  HBO cannot afford to allow its TV version to ramble like this author allows his books to ramble. If he is able to actually bring the story to a resolution in the next year or two, HBO can bring it to the screen in four seasons and you will have lost nothing for not reading the text.  I have no doubt that HBO will strike from its version all the rambling that is the hallmark of this work.<br /><br />I cannot recall having ever recommended someone to pass on reading the book in favor of watching the movie, but I guess there truly is a first time for everything.  I for one will not contribute another dollar to the coffers of this poser. If you choose to do so, you have been warned.
B0018OFN2W|2.0|Ok,I'll be honest when I started this movie from the opening credits, I knew that this would not live to rival the fist. My fist point, with this realization is the underground racing wardrobe, was F A K E FAKE. From the weird jewelry to stereotyped shirts and pants. Secondly, the written dialog was awful and tried too hard to cool. It was not believable in the least bit. Thirdly the fact that it also drags in the middle and makes me want to skipped forward twenty minuets or so. When I got this I was expecting the racing action that I loved in the fist one. Instead of the great peal off nitrous shots the the \\"warp-drive\\" with the nitrous shots was a little hard to watch without getting a headache. Although  some great racing scenes  it should have included more, the only race scenes worth watching are the opening scene, the derby scene, and the ending chase scene. Oh I forgot those are the only race scenes. It would have been ok as a Miami Vice script, but not a Fast and Furious. Whatever the first one gave this series the second one wasted it. Universal, what were you thinking.
B001Q94TQA|3.0|Disappointing that the movie plays fine but the extras are not watchable unless your player converts PAL.  I don't see where this is called out anywhere in the product description.  This is on a Sony BDP-S570
B003V4AK8E|1.0|The left toggle rubber came off already after only three weeks. Now there's no grip, I shouldn't just went original or bought an xbox. This was a wack wanna-be product
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game I can not put it down both my husband and I play and try to out do eachother thank you
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Let this be a lesson - don't look at the number of stars, read the reviews. With the number of big name actors, how could this movie be so blah? About the only positive point I can make is that the unarmed fight scenes looked realistic.
0446547654|5.0|I don't read much..but I chose this book because of the quote..\\"can love truly rewrite the past\\". It was amazing. I was crying so much and later into that day! I think a lot of people can relate this the story somewhat and that's why its so great.. READ IT! :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My friends always play this game, and they used to always ask me if I could play too, I said they didn't have it for the Kindle Fire. But now that this is out, I play all the time! I love it! the only thing that's bad is the ads and the high prices on the bombs..... but otherwise its awesome and runs smoothly on the Kindle Fire!! &hearts;&#9834;&#9733;
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|it was.kind of fun all you do is just shoot the bird to the pigs and distroy they not that exsiting
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Seriously, I don't know who can say this is a good movie, in some points It looks like Ryan is going to fall<br />asleep, it turns very violent without sense, If you expect car chases, It wont be any o just one, In Other sites, the review of this movie don't reach one star and I tell you why:<br /><br />1.- If you know somebody is going to kill you, and he broke into your house, what would you do when you see him?? run or defend yourself, in the movie, Channon went and talked to Bernie and got killed (I would RUN for sure).<br />2.- The bad boys know where Standard lives, and they go there three days after, silly<br />3.- They know everything about Standard, but they don't know he is married, in that point you realize that something is really wrong.<br />4.- There is a mafia gangster party and no one is watching the door, no bodyguards, no guns, cmmon!!.<br />5.- Too Slow movie, too silly, too violent, too predictable, Ryan Gosling looks heavily medicated, no car action.<br /><br />Is your choose to waste your time
B0054YH8DY|5.0|A big jump from their prior work, reminds of the Beatles (Sergeant Pepper) while retaining much of the S & G sound. Still sounds great 40+ years later. Highly recommended.
0385737955|5.0|OK I have never read this book by will soon. I though prefer you guys read the divergent series it is logically written and keeps you emminsly on the edge of you reading spot.
B00006I53S|5.0|I moved up to the 7d from my original Digital Rebel with the Sigma lens. Heck of a jump by comparison and I think that there is value only achievable by comparing the two cameras and lenses. Not a weekend photog here but not a pro either. I shoot a lot of stop-action and full-motion animal pics, especially when we show our dogs at quite a few dog shows. The rapid response from the 7d and this lens is phenomenal by comparison. I made a good choice for sure.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have ever bought! I still haven't gotten tired of listening to it!
B00000I8UJ|5.0|For this recording Dex is in a quartet setting with piano, bass & drums.He was in his prime when he made this album, & it is one of his best. Dex hsd his own \\"voice\\" in bebop. By that I mean when you hear him you know it's him right away, much the same as Stan Getz.<br /><br />Not much to say about the album. It speaks for itself. My favorite tune which I play all the time was written by Dex & is the first one on the album called \\"Cheese Cake.\\" mHighly recommended.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|This movie was good, but not what I was expecting.  I had a hard time keeping the characters straight, mostly.  It got better towards the end.  It's worth renting, but I wouldn't own the DVD of it.
B000003N89|5.0|Pianist/vocalist Diana Krall pays tribute to the Nat King Cole Trio on her Impulse! set. In general, the medium and up-tempo tunes work best, particularly such hot ditties as \\"I'm an Errand Girl for Rhythm,\\" \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" and \\"Hit That Jive Jack.\\" Krall does not attempt to directly copy Cole much (either pianistically or vocally), although his influence is obviously felt on some of the songs. The slow ballads are actually as reminiscent of Shirley Horn as Cole, particularly the somber \\"I'm Through With Love\\" and \\"If I Had You.\\" Guitarist Russell Malone gets some solo space on many of the songs and joins in on the group vocal of \\"Hit That Jive Jack,\\" although it is surprising that he had no other opportunities to interact vocally with Krall; a duet could have been delightful. Bassist Paul Keller is fine in support, pianist Benny Green backs Krall's vocal on \\"If I Had You,\\" and percussionist Steve Kroon is added on one song. Overall, this is a tasteful effort that succeeds.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't mentiom the pleasing work of Russell Malone, who does some excellent work on guitar in this cozy little Trio.I'm not sure how many albums he made with her, but at the moment he's doing CDs under his own name. He's one of the sleepers as a jazz guitarist & I believe he will be a jazz icon in the near future. This is great stuff from the woamn from Canada. Highly recommended.
068485743X|5.0|The First Five Pages is the best book on writing ever done, without exception, all others are mere pretenders to the throne. You can hire an editor, or an agent, attend seminars and writing courses, but none will give you as much as 2 percent of the knowledge contained in this book. If you're a published writer or a want-to-be, this is the most important book you will ever read about your craft. Buy it! Don't delay! It will change everything.
B00000IL29|5.0|Less overtly adventurous than its predecessor, Empyrean Isles, Maiden Voyage nevertheless finds Herbie Hancock at a creative peak. In fact, it's arguably his finest record of the '60s, reaching a perfect balance between accessible, lyrical jazz and chance-taking hard bop. By this point, the pianist had been with Miles Davis for two years, and it's clear that Miles' subdued yet challenging modal experiments had been fully integrated by Hancock. Not only that, but through Davis, Hancock became part of the exceptional rhythm section of bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams, who are both featured on Maiden Voyage, along with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and tenor saxophonist George Coleman. The quintet plays a selection of five Hancock originals, many of which are simply superb showcases for the group's provocative, unpredictable solos, tonal textures, and harmonies. While the quintet takes risks, the music is lovely and accessible, thanks to Hancock's understated, melodic compositions and the tasteful group interplay. All of the elements blend together to make Maiden Voyage a shimmering, beautiful album that captures Hancock at his finest as a leader, soloist, and composer.<br /><br />When I formed my first jazz group, we called it \\"Maiden Voyage\\" after this album. I was floored by it. It was obvious that this was a turning point in the history of jazz. Miles had begun the modal movement in jazz, & a few short years later Hancock pretty much perfected it. Freddie Hubbard on trumpet was at the top of his game. In later years I didn't appreciate Hubbards' experimentation, or to be more prcise, he got to a place which was more avant garde than mainstream jazz<br />like the great John Coltrane. George Coleman on tenor sax is also brilliant. With Ron Carter on bass & Tony Williams, drums, you've got an all star quintet. The finest tune for me matches the alobum title & \\"Dolphin Dance\\" is a real gem.<br /><br />Without this CD, your jazz collection is definitely incomplete. Highly recommended.te. Highly recommended.
B00000DOYL|5.0|I'm so surprised at how this album seems to get a lower rating because I consider this to be one of Led Zeppelin's best albums.  It's true they incorporate more synthesizer than in the past which I consider to be plus and works well with this album.  I think they were perhaps trying to target a younger demographic at the time which may have been a turn off to some of the fans at that time and seems to still today.  But I really like this album particularly when you compare it to a lot of the music coming out today highly recommended.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I had so much fun playing this game my sister really liked it to. she bugged me to play it.
B00338QENI|1.0|I really have mixed feelings about this book.  I found by half way, it got a bit boring and I had to push myself to keep reading.<br /><br />I personally would not recommend this book to read, unless you are into science or biology.  I regularly read true stories<br />but this one did not cut it for me.
B0063GORYU|4.0|just what I was looking for, good setting choices playable. haven't had any problems. like the undo button and hints.
B006M6VXYS|5.0|Beautiful, majestic, deep, emotional. Beautifully written and composed! A MUST LISTEN! Nightwish gets better with each album it produces and releases.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Awesome app! Works very well with HTC 4G and Toshiba Thrive tablet.  Remotely play music from anywhere in the house or while away.
0385473788|5.0|A very important work that every person should take the time to read.  A wonderful work from an extraordinary young girl.  I highly recommend!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Ive used plex for a long time and it has come along  way. But you do need to know something about servers and encodeing video  formats. I Direct stream most of my movie collection with plex. Works perfect and fast and with subtitles if i choose.
B007R41E8O|5.0|really like it.  love hidden object games with a mysterious story.  the graphics are clear and the objects are hidden just right.  not just in plain sight but not too hard to find.
0446572993|5.0|I have read all the baldacci novels.  I absolutely couldn't put it down.  some of his books I didn't find as rivoting as The Innocent.  Characters are super strong and I was not able to figure out the next step before it happened.  Great read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was a page turner, I was very drawn in to it, no suprise twists or turns.  I was very torn with Ana sometimes I wanted to smack her and sometimes I wanted to pat her on the back.  Toward the end of the book the words \\"oh my\\" were totally on my nerves, because I feel like it had been said a million times.  Problem with the book is that it took me back to the old \\"fairy tale\\" days where every man pleases a woman by simply touching her, toward the middle of the book the sex scenes made me roll my eyes and they were always the same each time, perhaps the author did some copy and paste??  But alas, I am not working right now, so I have to pass my time somehow so I am already reading the second book..
B0010SKSTO|5.0|The material contained here within this tome is amazingly benefical! The author gave an insightful repertiore on how to examine an individual to the extent one can't confuse a lier from a politician! Use this book to vote in 2012 election so watch out Mitt Romney - Democrates now have you Republicans on view!
B0008ENICU|5.0|One of the older versions - or the oldest?  Knew it is a fun movie. Newer version is different, but oldest is the best! Enjoy it and happy to have it and the newer version in my library! Worth having in my collection!  Was also considered to be a gift, but they already had both newer and this one!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it's fun to play, and unlimited turns keeps the five year old happy<br />I would suggest this game to anyone with a love for ice age characters... beautiful graphics too!!!!

B001NLCBJI|5.0|This is a very well done film, a strong script delivered by two excellent actors. I have watched this movie several times and never tire of it. I wish they would do a sequal... For me, it is a 5 star movie.<br />Ron

B002M9WW30|5.0|If you love the Rocky Balboa character, this collection is a must have! Watching them on blue ray, is better than watching them originally in the theater, so much better clarity and depth of view. The price for all of them is a knockout, it'll knock your block off.....\\"Absolutely\\"

B006P0FIB0|5.0|Saw a sample of \\"The Three Musketeers 3D\\" on Vios \\"On Demand\\" and it looked awesome. Bought the 3D version and loved the original story and the great 3D effects.  As an older person (67) who used to like playing on the roof, but no longer enjoy heights, the \\"high\\" fighting scenes are just great! I don't understand the jaded reviews of almost all 3D movies. Being in the film always feels great to me, and it doesn't have to be a \\"wow moment\\" to make the effect enjoyable.  I have used this picture to show off my 60 inch Sharp 3D and everyone loves the film.  My 5 1/2 year old grandson has watched it many times and I think this and \\"Hugo\\" have made him a 3D fan.<br />I am waiting for all these good movies that are slowly starting to be released in 3D. This is the future just like Blu-Ray HD is the now!  Make sure you make up your own mind and don't let the reviewers online make it up for you.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this game is the best game ive ever played. I play this all the time. my mom tells me to stop playing it. that's how much I plat
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Original, amazing, cannot put it down. A keeper to read over and over again!!! Give it a chance, it's addictive!!
B005BY3XHC|3.0|This book is a very quick read even though I found myself re-reading several paragraphs from time to time trying to fully understand the authors intentions.  Admittedly, this is my first Deepka Chopra book and I found it both inspiring and frustrating.  Deepak is occasionally too vague or seems to go too far into Buddhist Dharma to explain each \\"law\\". In the end, I'm glad to have read it even though I came away underwhelmed.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This app is great just wish I could access it without having to use a wifi connection. I  have found that most church's don't have wifi connections so I can't use it to teach with nor can I read from it with the pastor as he preaches the message.

B0000C9ZLD|3.0|after the great debut IS THIS IT, the strokes create room on fire...i really like some songs like REPTILIA and THE END HAS NO END, but most of the songs i really don´t care much...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, Wow, Wow, I didn't know what to expect being turned on to this book by a friend who actually didn't like the first book, but I did.  I was intrigued by the story line and was starting to feel compassion for Christian right away since he was such a troubled individual and I wanted to know what caused his compulsion.  This is a love story, erotica and fiction, and should be regarded that way. How wonderful to see how he changes through the love of Ana. I have since read all three books and loved them all, each one got better. I now know what all the excitement is about these books and will read these again.  They stay with you, which is, I am sure, a compliment to the author.  Bravo!
B000060P79|1.0|it´s completelly embarassing the posture of the guys from simple plan....they must be 30 years old men, but sings naive lyrics with a complete lack of talent and the songs seems the same...TERRIBLE!!Almost everything on earth is better than this silly product.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love these books.  Well worth the money I paid for it.  I have read this series 3 times already... well worth it to me.<br />FYI - Kobo is cheaper... 9.99 per book.  To buy the book in the store it would cost 19.99 per book.  11.32 is worth it to me.

0307950689|1.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books and have liked all of them--until this one.  I got bored and so irritated that I didn't even finish the last 10 or so pages.  I kept thinking the book was finally over, but it just kept going on and on--and I just couldn't bear to read another word.  It started out okay, piqued my interest, but then disolved into more information than I ever wanted to know about the Masons and several of the character's endless interpretations of religion.  Don't waste your money on this one.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've read the 1st and 2nd book. The 1st one is the better of the 2. I feel as though the story just drags on and on. I would recommend it if you enjoy reading romance novels; I enjoy reading one every once in a while.

015603008X|5.0|I've always loved the story of Charlie Gordon, first introduced to me in short story form in the seventh grade. This is one book I can go back and read over and over again, and it still brings tears to my eyes. Really a great book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I suggested this book to our bookclub a couple of weeks before it became a \\"hot item.\\"  Half the women in my group literally read it overnight whereas I struggled to get through it.  So is it me?  Why was I not as \\"shocked\\" as some of my friends?  Why did it not leave me \\"trembling with desire?\\"  That will be a question for my therapist at our next appointment. :)<br />A few things in the book I found interesting but in general I found the story lame and the writing simple. It's one of those books that I feel will make a better movie than a \\"good read.\\"  Will I read the next two books?  Probably, so I can at least converse with 90% of the population that is addicted to this trilogy.  One thing for sure, it does point out that books like this is NEEDED.  There is definitely an interest for some hot & heavy sexual content...but without the romance puh lease!
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|Thought this would be a great movie, not painful hour after hour of watching a man walking around looking at the sky. I was highly disappointed, but I forced myself to watch the whole thing. I really regret it. Artistic? Yes. Visually appealing? Yes. Worth watching for hours? Oh god, no.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|this is my first review and i will be doing many of them. I will tile all mine as such. This book is fantastic. It pesents an ever thickening plot with just enough surprise and horror mixed in. All set in a realistic future. Highly recomend this book
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Not a lot of difference between this game and any of the other 'run a business or city' games; except for the really annoying error that makes it so I can only visit one of my friends and randomly makes the game think that I have no Internet connection.

B002GV03C6|4.0|Attractive New York City-girl Jennifer (Camille Keaton) is taking a vacation in the countryside for peace and for writing her first novel, however when 4 rowdy locals (Eron Tabor, Richard Pace, Anthony Nicoles and Gunter Kleeman) attack her, strip her, rape her and leave her for dead. However she soon starts taking revenge on the men in horrific ways.<br /><br />A highly disturbing and revolting horror thriller from writer-director Meir Zarichi is one of the most infamous films of all time! since 1978 and 1980, this movie was widely banned or censored in some countries. The film was slammed by critics upon it's release even by Siskel and Ebert who declared it the worst film they ever seen and Siskel nearly walked out on it but some called it degenerate trash while some call it a feminist film as a few critics liked it including legendary Joe Bob Briggs.  It has became legendary and a best seller in the video market back in the 80s and 90s as it still has the power to shock and appall viewers, this movie was near an X rating as it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic rape. I saw this when i was 15 when i rented it in the mid 90s and it made me sick even with that horrifying castration scene, but miss Keaton is gorgeous and courageous in this movie as she knows how to kill the baddies. A remake was made in 2010 but not as disturbing as this movie but it was still a fun remake, however this movie is still one of the most nastiest films i've ever seen.<br /><br />The Anchor Bay Blu-Ray contains good picture and sound quality as they deliver with extras like 2 audio commentaries with one by Joe Bob Briggs and Meir Zarchi, a featurette, poster-and-still gallery, TV spots, trailers, radio spots and alternate main title. One of Anchor Bay's best releases so far to a hard to watch cult fave.
B000O77QD8|4.0|Loved this movie almost as well as I like the book.  Another masterpiece by Clint Eastwood.  Lots of action for the guys but its a tale for everyone.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is based on a true story and I will not give any spoilers.  If you are looking for a movie that helps you believe there is goodness in people, then this is the film to watch.  The actors are amazing and it may be Sandra Bullock's best role ever.  Don't miss this one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love Love Love this book. Probably my favorite out of the trilogy. My only problem with not only this one, but all three, is that I am left wanting more. But I feel that way about most books/book series. Read this trilogy and you won't be sorry. Makes you think about how lucky you are that we all live in a world that is not crippled by war. (Yes we have war, but not the way depicted in the Hunger Games Trilogy.)

0375869026|5.0|[[ASIN:0375869026 Wonder]]. My 8 year old daughters and I read together every night.  Wonder has been a book that will stay with us, so touching!  After each chapter we have had amazing conversations, about friends, and how sometimes doing or saying the \\" right\\" thing in front of classmates is hard.  The premise of \\"don't judge a boy by his face\\" has led to great conversations as well, a book we will surely read again when the insecurities of pre-teen and teen years approach.  We have laughed out loud and cried with this book.  Wonder earned itself a permanent home on our bookshelves!

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great finish to a series. Would read others by this author if available.  Read all three in 3 weeks and couldn't put them down.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|My issue isn't writing a book and then figuring out how to get it on Kindle Fire. I have already wrote a book, and had it published, but how to add it to Kindle? The author has done an excellent job in writing and explaining it, in full detail, along with photos. Which, is great for us who are Adult ADHD, like me who think in turns of pictures. I need to see it, don't rattle on trying to tell me about it, because it will go right over my head. So, for now I will muddle through getting my book onto Kindle Fire. Anyone who has wrote a book, short stories, or poems, really needs to buy and read this book. It is a book you will use repeatedly, through out the course of your writing lol. Good luck, writers [[ASIN:1419659596 Eyes Wide Open:: A Mortgage Guide For First Time Home Buyers]]
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am more giddy than my giddy aunt. I saw the midnight showing of the AVENGERS last night and, at the end, my face hurt and warped from grinning so big. I am so wired I can't form a coherent thought. Here's a salvo of stream-of-consciousness impressions, in whatever order.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is simply terrific as the Hulk's alter (and calmer) ego. I actually prefer his interpretation of Dr. Banner over Bana's and Norton's. Ruffalo steers away from the deadening angst that made me fidget in earlier Hulk pictures. He finds a balance. This Banner exhibits a dry sense of humor but exudes this quirky, low simmer edginess. And I love Ruffalo's interactions with Downey, Jr., two swaggerful eggheads matching their test tubes against each other and applying big, sciency words. I like that there's respect between their two characters. There's an intriguing twist involving Banner's relationship with the Hulk, of which I won't say more. The Hulk - and this seems to be a unanimous impression - hijacks the movie.<br /><br />Comic book geeks like me have recently been dogging Marvel's latest company crossover event, AVENGERS VS. X-MEN. And, yet, this film demonstrates that, sometimes, there's nothing more exhilarating than eyeballing an epic hero vs. hero scrap. Mjolnir, meet the Hulk's face. And have you ever wondered what happens should Thor's enchanted hammer go up against Captain America's indestructible shield?<br /><br />The plot revolves around the far-ranging machinations of Loki, Asgardian god of mischief. Those who've read the Avengers' comic book origin should note a smidgen of familiarity, but only a smidgen. The Tesseract - someone mistakenly thought &#34;Tesseract&#34; sounds cooler than &#34;cosmic cube&#34; - plays a part. The bad guys whom Loki recruits as an invasion force aren't Skrulls. Not exactly. But they do pose an extinction level threat, alarming enough that some assembly becomes required.<br /><br />Captain America is well utilized here, although I'm hating his awkward modern-day costume. I vastly prefered his more practical WWII outfit. But maybe I just like pouches.<br /><br />Joss Whedon, Joss Whedon. His storytelling has big scope; it has grandeur. Whedon orchestrates a sprawling, high-profiled cast and just about gets away with not slighting anyone. He does rely some on your familiarity with the character development sunk into the prior films. He manages to tie in various plot threads from previous Marvel pictures. Although Stark, Cap, and Banner get the lion's share of the spotlight, Whedon devotes time and space to side characters like the slinky but lethal spy, the Black Widow, and the likable, unobstrusive Agent Coulson. If you assume the Black Widow's defining action moment surfaces in that early interrogation scene, you'd be all kinds of not right. Scarlett Johansson ticks off Whedon's Buffy box, not only in things asskickery but also in terms of strong character beats (the Widow's dialogue with Loki happens to be an acting showcase). She's so much more here than when she was featured in IRON MAN 2. But if I were to pick out two people who may have been underused, they'd have to be Maria Hill and Hawkeye. I do feel that Cobie Smulders was wasted.<br /><br />I love that, like in the comics, Thor never gives up on his half-brother.<br /><br />The first half hour is essentially a slow burn set-up that may or may not keep you engaged. And at times Whedon does sacrifice narrative for those wild action sequences, and that's okay, because Whedon treats us to a series of marvelous cape-on-cape violence. In true Marvel fashion, these heroes harbor instant grudges against each other. But all those violent &#34;misunderstandings&#34; merely whet your appetite. Joss unleashes the white knuckle action in the third act. The extended climactic combat sequence - as the Avengers hold the line against a horde of grotesque Not Skrulls - is off the charts and so damn gratifying. There's this now famous tracking shot inwhich I'm reminded of the 1990s X-Men cartoon in which the camera would often track the X-Men in frenzied action, as they hurtle in and out of the picture, occasionally mingling with each other only to break off again into individual skirmishes. I was mesmerized by Whedon's sweeping, organic approach to the battle scenes.<br /><br />No surprise, there are heaps of whip-smart one-liners, plenty of them generated by a smirky Robert Downey, Jr. - and yet even Hemsworth's regal thunder god elicits chuckles. No contest, though, the brutalizing Hulk - who, by the way, is rendered to savage life in impeccable CG - captures two of the film's biggest laughs.<br /><br />For pure escapism and sheer fanfare and fan service beyond expectation, THE AVENGERS is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. I have to see it again. But you, you make sure to stick around for the embedded scene during the post-credits and then for the post-credit scene. You may wet your pants. Or you may, afterwards, go &#34;What the flippin' flip was that?&#34;<br /><br />Hours and hours later, I'm still big grinning. Joss Whedon actually pulled it off.<br /><br />What I have is the Blu-Ray 2-disc edition. I must say I'm digging the crystal clear, hi-res video quality of the blu-ray disc.

B003Y5H5EW|3.0|Non stop, action with sexy girls who are able to take on anyone in a fight. After a while to me, it got a bit too much. Boring actually as the story was not very interesting, and I do want to see more than just action.<br /><br />The acting was good. They all acted well.<br /><br />The camera work and special effects were good.<br /><br />I would not recommend it unless you are hooked on the series.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is the one of greatest movie I have ever seen, and based off of a short story called \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" it really shows you the talent and genius of Stephen King, one of the GREATEST writers of our time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app that is constantly being updated and improved. I use the plans every day to read the entire Bible in a year and the Joyce Meyer plan is profound. I also appreciate that you can read the same scripture in several different versions.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I have to say that I'm very satisfied with this supplier. The product was delivered on time. My little nephews had a very special Easter treat. They got the movie the  day before Easter, and they were able to watch it as a family in the morning. I would definitely purchase from this supplier again.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|I agree with most reviewers, seasons 1-2 had good episodes, but seemed to be going nowhere.  They dragged out the time travel element in some stories for far too long.  It should have been resolved in one season.<br /><br />In season 3 it is indeed basically a serial story with 2 dozen or so chapters.  I won't name episodes to avoid spoiling.  Especially good were the harsh elements, like the captain's forcible taking of new engine parts, the torture of Hoshi, and the death of the clone.<br /><br />The 4th season was like movie time with all the 2 and 3 part episodes connecting the history of the universe together.  The series finale wasn't worthy of watching, with the exception of the crew getting their due reward from the new federation.  The next generation duo made the episode as dull as watching home movies.  Someone elses home movies at that!<br /><br />Visually, the 60's technology of the original series hardly looked as if it could follow Enterprise.<br /><br />I would like to suggest that there is nothing in this series (except perhaps for the alien damage to north america in the season 3 opener) that wouldn't fit into the new alternate timeline of the 2009 movie.  Enterprise with it's modern technology fits in a lot better with the new timeline and could easily be a precurser to the new movies instead of the last gasp of the old series as some think of it.
B003405MF6|4.0|From the first few seconds Beck establishes his uncanny expressive ability to translate emotions to the listener.  Every note has an inflection, tonal aspect, and vocal element to it, such that gives Jeff's playing a conversational quality.  You're hearing a guitar, sure, but its talking to you, telling you a story.<br /><br />Many tunes on this release make me feel good.  Jeff has a way of bringing joy and emotions to the music, hence the aptly selected title (emphasis on \\"Emotion\\").  This CD has many great instrumental and vocal tunes.  The tunes are strong and listenable, unlike many fusion type artists that are technically proficient players but lack the ability to write a good song.<br /><br />Been listening to Jeff for over 25 years.  Over the years Jeff just keeps getting better and better, and stretching the boundaries. I didn't like his \\"techno/electronic\\" phase so much.  This CD is nothing like that style and is terrific on many levels.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so awesome! My entire family plays it for hours on end. Its a spin off of Mario world but with a leprechaun. Very addicting and fun....I didn't stop smiling and my 5year old loves it.
0553582038|2.0|Oh, I'm sure he has an editor, but he or she was clearly not on the job for this one. I enjoyed the first three books, though the third book showed signs of declining quality. This one was tedious. And, I hear it gets worse in the fifth book.<br /><br />I fear that Martin either doesn't know the \\"big\\" stories he should be telling, or he just doesn't know how to get there. A few loose threads or unresolved stories can be interesting and give the reader something to ponder later. However, this has become the norm in this series, and it's clear that it's simply poor writing and apparent lack of imagination.<br /><br />Even in the first three books, Martin's work seems to be written with a television adaptation in mind. With a background in television and film, that's not really a surprise. Ironically, it could be that the trimming required for a screen adaptation is what eventually saves the stories in this book and onwards. While I was somewhat disappointed in the first season of the HBO series, it could be that it will at least improve the telling of this book.<br /><br />At any rate, I think I'm giving up on this series. It showed promise in the early books -- even if it was more soap-opera than powerful epic, but it's grown tiresome.

0439023513|1.0|After reading the first two books, I had such high expectations of Mockingjay. Hunger Games was great and Catching Fire was awesome! I felt Collins writing was so unique and breathtaking, only to be disappointed by Mockingjay. Its like the characters were stripped from the things that made you fall in love with them in the first place. I'm not sure of what Collins was thinking but she could have brought on a War without such disappointments in the characters. Honestly, I only kept reading with hopes that the book would get better! Unfortunately, it never reached the heights of talent Collins has proven in the past.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A friend let me borrow her books, I loved them so much..I wanted my own copy to read again.  Reading this again and slowly, it's as if I am watching a movie.  This triology truely let's your imagination work through the story.  I can read each day after a stressful workday, and lose myself in the book.  This is a great book to read and discuss with friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i liked this game from the start it also provides a constant challange as you move into harder levels which keeps me from being bored
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|A lot of critics had an issue with the ambiguous ending, but I think it worked.  The film is less plot driven and more of a character study, anyway.<br /><br />Martha is a lonely, cautious soul. We learn, through casual dialogue, that she had an absent father, a mother who died and left Martha in the care of an aunt, and an older sister who meant well but was off at college for Martha's formative years.  The movie wisely makes her childhood isolating, but not an over-the-top horror show of tragedies and abuse.  What happens to Martha could happen to a lot of people who feel alone.<br /><br />At the start of the film, Martha runs away from a secretive commune set in a lovely, if broken down, farm.  We understand that Martha has been in this isolated place for a while, because when she calls her sister from a pay phone, she seems unsure of where she is or how long she's been away.  Martha moves in with her sister Lucy and brother-in-law in their palatial summer home.  Lucy tries to figure out what happened to Martha, but doesn't quite know how to deal with this odd, closed-off girl . . . or Martha's increasingly bizarre and paranoid behavior.  Through Martha's memories, we learn the disturbing details of the commune (really a cult) -- and the reasons for Martha's increasing fear.<br /><br />What's most compelling - and most upsetting - are the flashbacks of Martha's indoctrination into the cult.  We watch with a sinking heart as the members of the cult use the language of love, acceptance and family to slowly break down Martha (renamed by the cult leader \\"Marcy May\\") and convince her that their strange way of life - and their domination by spooky cult leader Patrick - is \\"truly good.\\"  (Be warned - some of the cult flashbacks are strong stuff - this is no movie for kids).<br /><br />The acting is superb, especially by Elizabeth Olsen, but also by the actors playing the bewildered Lucy and her husband, John Hawkes as Patrick, and the actors playing the three cult members who \\"guide\\"/bully Martha in the cult.<br /><br />Effectively creepy and thought-provoking.

B000JMKSE2|5.0|This is, maybe, the most practical but deeply sustained book I've ever read about how to make business online. If someone want to make business in Internet, she should read this book first. Why? Long Tail Theory roots the very basics of Internet: It is about niche. It is all about finding, loving, breathing, caring about your niche.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great but not spending my own money for this! also needs to give u lots more energy to sure! the energy runs out way to quick and its not the same as the old oregon

B0011WMHRK|5.0|this album is amazing and if you dont have it you should get it right now and if you dont you are a dum dum so stop reading this and buy it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game and I am trying to beat my brother and I hope that who ever has a kindle or a device like this you should get it!
0345803485|1.0|I was recommended this book, by the blurbs written about it, I thought it would take me out of my comfort zone. This did not live up to the hype.  Sorry to say it was repetitious.  Nothing is that daring.  Mr.Grey is a bad dominant.  I found myself skipping sections b/c I was sick of reading the same thing over and over
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a pretty fun game and its also cute to have the Ice Age characters. The problem I am having is that when i try to go to toher people's villages, its says i must update the game. I do this and it repeatedly tells me the same thing. so, i cannot visit other villages.  this is kind of annoying.  I do like it enough to give it 4 stars regardless. It is worth playing but some glitches need addressed.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|i don't know with other thing but it's not for kindle fire<br />it doesn't work<br />fix it please<br />don't ever download this thing
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Yes it's short time-wise, but my god listen to what you get!! I've never been a fan of the \\"we've got 70 plus minutes to fill on this here cd, so put everything available on regardless of quality\\" etc school of thought. For me, the old vinyl lp standard of 35 minutes overall (about 18 min per side) was always a perfect constraint with which an artist can do their thing (exceptions being some double lp sets, ie the White Album, Physical Graffiti, Exile On Main Street).<br /><br />In any event, if you like George's work you'll LOVE this set, and for complainers who cry 'rip off', I would just point out how Olivia Harrison did NOT do what most major rock figures routinely do, which is to make these \\"bonus\\" or \\"extras/out-takes\\" sets available ONLY if you buy them as part of an uber-pricey super-deluxe boxes costing hundreds. Instead, you only have to drop a tenner.<br /><br />And if you LOVE George's work, well you've already bought this haven't you?<br /><br />;-)<br /><br />Cheers!<br />MMK

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Everyone has been raving about this book, so I decided to give it a try... Huge disappointment.  The writing and language is very redundant.  Not to mention, the main female character is a twenty-something virgin who has never masturbated.  Overall the book is unrealistic and did not live up to all the hype :/
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|This is my first review of any book so please be kind... I absolutely loved this book. I was depressed after reading 50 Shades of Grey because I was finished in a week with all three books. I went online searching for a similar story and stumbled upon this book. All I can say is that I have found my new favorite author!!! It is a lot more realistic than 50 shades and by far a better read from my stand point. Also I just want to say that it was less than half the price for a better read :) I plan on reading this again and again! I cannot wait until October!!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Captain America: \\"And Hulk...smash.\\"<br /><br />Full of humor, drama, and loads of Avenging action makes it one of the most brilliant superhero feature films to date. It even gives \\"[[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins [Blu-ray]]]\\" a run for it's money. There is honestly nothing negative I can say about this film, except for one thing but that's a spoiler for those who haven't seen it yet. Iron Man is still Iron Man, Hulk is the best he's been yet, and there's no team quite like the Avengers. Who at LEGO would disagree to them making a series about this film? (I recommend \\"[[ASIN:B007GFFGFQ LEGO Hulk Helicarrier Breakout 6868]]\\" and for you Avengers collectors, \\"[[ASIN:B007GE5X78 LEGO Quinjet Aerial Battle 6869]]\\" is a must have). The casting is brilliant, the action is great, and the villains are threatening and self-absorbed. For the last one, mainly Loki. These lines sum up the film for you:<br /><br />Loki: \\"I have an army.\\"<br />Tony Stark: \\"We have a Hulk.\\"<br /><br />All of you out there, in short, go see this movie. Five out of five.<br /><br />Iron Man: \\"If we can't save the world, we can darn well avenge it.\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is wonderful! You won't want to put it down once you have started. Ironically, all the descriptions of food make you really hungry.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I thought this might be a good app to run instead of wasting $ on a real fan or air conditioners, but what I found was a pleathora of sounds that can be mixed in nearly countless ways to get the exact sound you want.  I live near mountains, and this app is able to combine different nature sounds in a way that sound absolutely realistic.  The samples are of great quality and you will not hear a loop, just clean, authentic, relaxing sounds!  Highly recommend!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent version of the Bible. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to read the Word of God. Five stars!!!
B002RS7HGI|2.0|I understand the need to add a bit of drama to historical movies to make it more consumer friendly.  But if you are going to stray that far away from fact you should just change the names and create a fictional character.  Queen Elizabeth was an amazing ruler and person.  She had plenty of drama and intrigue in her real life that I don't see the need to fabricate or diminish her person.  Same feelings for the first movie they made.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this apps awesome!! I love its great for kids and adults please rate this game whatever it deserves and thanks!
B007IE4DT0|5.0|After searching the Web and YouTube for new and striped down songs of George Harrison. To hear them the way they were made be to heard on Vinyl. Upgraded my Turntable and Speakers last year and it just paid off! Clean and clear, Just takes one back in time Wanting more !!! I just love hearing George's Guitar....  Can't wait for Volume 2
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a former professional dominatrix, I thought it was fabulous that a BDSM romance novel was getting so much attention! I decided to read my friend's copy.<br /><br />Three words: I am disappointed.<br /><br />I am sure many women think that they are having their eyes opened to this \\"risque\\" BDSM culture and imagine themselves in Anastasia's shoes. They are in for a big surprise. This book was so vanilla that I started re-writing passages in my head so they were more accurate to real-life. Christian is so horribly written. It's almost like the author was trying to go for some sort of plot line like the movie Secretary, but failed miserably, her characters lacking any type of emotional depth and acting more like angsty tweens looking to experiment for the first time. Predictable, ridiculous and pretentious. Spend your money to support a local BDSM club instead, and witness real-life, not this soggy fantasy.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Book One is amass with contradictions. I am not a prude but I couldn't help putting myself in Ana's place wishing her to stand up for herself with his inane cruelty. I know she was inexperienced and he gave her immeasurable pleasure but at what price. She couldn't separate the pleasure from his dark side in what she thought was love. He was so dark that it was very disturbing to me as I read some of it but other parts were so sensual and arousing that I wished for more of that side of him. I wanted to reach in the story and shake the hell out of her for allowing herself to be brutalized for his fetishes. I have gasped, sobbed,felt extreme anger and arousal in alot of this book. I will read the other 2 to see how the story plays out.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Review no. 281. I saw Judas Priest on this very tour - just prior to the Masters Of Metal trek with Heaven & Hell, Motorhead and Testament. I've heard many 'mixed' opinions of this Priest 'Nostradamus' 2-CD. And as a few other fans have mentioned before, this is more like an Iron Maiden CD. I tend to somewhat agree with that, but in an entirely good way. Tracks I got the most out of are the two openers \\"Dawn Of Creation\\" and the ass-kicking \\"Prophecy\\" (I'm sure these songs were played during the live set), the well-played \\"Revelations\\", \\"Sands Of Time\\", \\"Shadows In The Flame\\", the astounding title cut \\"Nostradamus\\" and the awesome (dramatic, to some point) eight-minute Priest modern-day gem \\"Future Of Mankind\\". At 'Nostradamus' being at a double-disc duration a few old school Priest fans may find it too lengthy. But I will say it fully possesses some good melodies, those strong Halford vocals that SO many of us has grown to love over the years as well as a true beauty rarely found in 'real metal bands' anymore. Maybe not a Judas Priest five-star masterpiece like 'Sad Wings Of Destiny', their milestone (so to speak) 'British Steel' or 'Screaming For Vengeance' but still a fine pick, nonetheless.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome. this game is so fun it reminds me of Mario love love love it. cant wait for more . thanks
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Review number 194. I must say that this DVD turned out to be much better than I had anticipated. Truly deserves a five-star rating. 'It Might Get Loud' brings together three of the most inventive, trend-setting and innovative guitarists - namely Jimmy Page, U2's The Edge and The White Stripe's mastermind Jack White. This DVD is priceless - the way these three six-string pioneers compare notes, tell stories, try to learn from each other, etc. This DVD had some super-rare U2 footage from 1979-80 that I have never seen before. Was sort of taken with where they show Jack White 'constructing' his own homemade guitar and then where he drives to a remote cabin and piddle around a bit on the piano - playing some vintage (I'm guessing) blues number. Plus, I loved the scene where you're invited into Jimmy Page's den - where he is a obviously a major vinyl collector. He plays a 45 single or two by his musical influences like Link Wray and Robert Johnson. Worth - many, (many) repeated plays.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I will recommend draw something the app doesn't have glitches and you can play with friends from facebook, twitter,  email, and random players. its adicting I want to play 24/7
B007SSDS24|2.0|This is an unfinished film with a few bright spots. If there were such a thing as 2.5 stars, that is where I would rate it.  It is just a bit below average. This is an unfinished film it is as though they just ran out of money before they could finish the story.  The story doesn't conclude - it just stops in mid stream (quite literally in a sense).  I did not feel too robbed at the 3.99 I spent, I was very disappointed at how they just dropped the story at the end, but it is not without some entertainment value. This movie is much better than say a typical Syfy channel production.  In fact that is how I would describe this movie - as a bigger budget SyFy Channel movie.  If you like that sort of thing, you will enjoy this one.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I switched from a 1 watt version to this 2watt version and it was well worth the change.  I am using a 19db panel antenna and saw an immediate difference, with the link quality way, way up.  I am guessing that getting the signal out not in, is where the extra power helps with the link quality. I plan to do away with the tiny coax cable of about 6 feet as about 1/2 the signal is lost in the small cable at that length and the 2.4gig hz super high frequency of the wi-fi signal range. I will hard wire by solder this inside of my panel or may find a short adapter for my next experiment.<br /> I found that this software was easy to load, easy to use and there are instructions on the disk. This device also offers the N band and I found these signals to travel much further and have better link quality. There are instructions on the disc for the software and more. This 2watts takes more power from the usb plug so I would not just yank it out powered up. If you disconnect it I think it would be wise to power down or do a soft disconnect. I would recommend this booster. This one is also compatible with Linux.
0345803485|2.0|I usually make my reading selections based on other reviews.  I loved The Hunger Games trilogy and purchased them after seeing them stay on top of Amazon's top 100 for a while.  That's why I purchased Fifty Shades of Grey, hoping that it would be the kind of trilogy I could tear through with gusto.<br /><br />It is drudgery to get through this book.  I have this thing, where I can't just stop something I start until I finish and therefore, I will finish it- but it is work.  I'm halfway through and I want to stop.  The characters are flimsy.  There is no depth.  When I see the book on the table, I think, \\"Oh yeah, I really need to finish that (so I can get to something good).\\"<br /><br />I find it strange this book is on top of the 100 list.  Its average at best.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|This was an excellent movie! I am pleased with my purchase!I received it on time! No damages! Would order again!
0345803485|5.0|FIrst off I know everyone has their own opinion but I am going to be honest and say I was really surprised when I read all the negative reviews on this book. I had heard nothing but good things about it and bought all 3. I am glad I didn't pay attention to the reviews because I absolutely LOVE IT! I am a 2nd grade teacher and just received my degree in Library Science so I starting to get more hooked on books than before. Especially now that I have time! I do not want to say anything about the book other than, \\"You will not be able to out it down, I repeat, you will not be able to put it down!\\" I just started the second one and just love it! Sometime we need to just get away for a bit from real life and I love where this book takes me. I have a 4 year old and 2 year old and keep me on my feet so this is a great relaxer ;) Enjoy!
B005O7PSRO|5.0|I love this show!  Nathan and Stana have done a wonderful job in the spoken and unspoken relational language.  Their chemistry (as well as good writing) have made this show a must see in our house.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the most unusual and most successful debut albums I have ever heard, from an artist that even a few months ago I did not know existed. Both lyrically and musically, the album takes us into an alternate world, a world populated by young women who are fatally attracted to  seriously flawed men, but this doesn't seem to bother them. They not only accept it, they revel in it. Although most of the songs are built around this theme, redundancy is avoided because the characters are vividly detailed and the musical presentations are diverse. I would like to mention that any comparisons I make to musical genres or other artists must be considered approximations; the music on this album is highly original and frankly, rather difficult to describe.<br /><br />In the opener and title song, \\"Born To Die\\", Lana sings a ballad with a world-weariness and fatalism that calls to mind Marianne Faithfull or even Marlene Dietrich: \\"Feet don't fail me now/Take me to the finish line...Choose your last words/This is the last time/Cause you and I, we were born to die\\". The next track, my favorite, \\"Off To The Races\\", is completely different, an upbeat hip-hop track. In this song a girl with \\"a Las Vegas past\\" is kept and well-tended by a gangster type who \\"...loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart\\". This relationship would seem dysfunctional to most, but the picture Lana paints makes it sound valid, desirable and a lot of fun. In the somber \\"Video Games\\", she coaxes her young lover, \\"Tell me all the things you wanna do/I heard that you like the bad girls honey, is that true?\\" We return to hip-hop and enter the playground of the wealthy in \\"National Anthem\\": \\"Money is the anthem of success/So before we go out, what's your address?...God you're so handsome/Take me to the Hamptons\\". \\"Carmen\\" in the ballad by that name is one character not preoccupied with relationships. Her problems are different: \\"The boys, the girls/They all like Carmen...Doesn't have a problem/Lyin' to herself/'Cause her liquor's top shelf\\". \\"Million Dollar Man\\" is sung in a style that I would have to call 40's or 50's blues (very interesting vocal here), and the reason she is blue is, as she tells her man, \\"You're screwed up and brilliant/You look like a million-dollar man/So why is my heart broke?\\"<br /><br />The total effect of the album would be depressing except that the interesting lyrics and Lana's varied vocals are such a delight that any sadness is mitigated. Then too, why feel sorry for someone who doesn't feel sorry for herself? Lana's characters are content with the lives they are living. I hope Lana gets to make a second album because I certainly want to see where she takes us next.a problem/Lyin' to herself/'Cause her liquor's top shelf\\". \\"Million Dollar Man\\" is sung in a style that I would have to call 40's or 50's blues (very interesting vocal here), and the reason she is blue is, as she tells her man, \\"You're screwed up and brilliant/You look like a million-dollar man/So why is my heart broke?\\"<br /><br />The total effect of the album would be depressing except that the interesting lyrics and Lana's varied vocals are such a delight that any sadness is mitigated.

0553573403|5.0|I read the book after starting to watch the HBO second series. This is unusual for a fantasy book. The supernatural element and magic are there but low key and all the more frightening for being that. The characters are real with faults and vitues like normal people; no exaggerated goodness or wickedness. You are not sure who to like or dislike. George Martin leaves it up to you. It is beautifully written with desciptions up there with Tolkien. Best of all, it is a strange medieval world (my husband thinks it's Dark Ages), obviously our world but not quite. Sometimes it reads like a history book.<br /><br />The author kills off favourite characters which is unnerving. Some of the scenic descriptions are quite terrifying, for instance, the Wall. Also check out the Sky cell in the Vale of Arryn where one of the characters is imprisoned. It could give you nightmares.<br /><br />Some of the violence is graphic, although all historically accurate and I don't particularly like the sex as I think it jars, but that's just a personal opinion. The book is mesmerising and difficult to put down. I am not usually a fan of heavily political plotlines, but in this case, I read every bit. The Stark children are my favourite characters and of course Tyrion, the small man. However, I do not like Catelyn or her ghastly sister and little Lord Robert, nor do I like Dani and her Khal Drogo. The thing is, everybody will have different likes and dislikes.<br /><br />You can read this even if you do not normally like fantasy.
0670023329|5.0|A must read.<br /> The only thing I would like to add is that if you<br /> use Google Earth you can see the camp.<br /> It's located at 39 34' 30\\" N and 126 04' 18\\" E.<br /> If you move north-east along the river you<br /> come to the dam.  Continue moving along the river<br /> you pass the guard post and the factory.<br /> Still moving north-east along the river around<br /> the bend you come to the Northern terminus of the<br /> fence at a fortified guard post. From here you<br /> can follow the fence by following the service<br /> road. Every so often you will spot a fortified<br /> guard post.
B007WV05GY|1.0|This movie was dumb. Seriously. So, so unbelievable. The acting sucked. The dialog was terrible. The wolves were dumb and unbelievable.<br /><br />Useless waste of time, unless you're, say 14 years old, male, and scared of fake-looking wolves.<br /><br />I've never done a review of just about anything before, but damn, the way people are gushing about this moving, I really don't have a choice.

1932735410|4.0|I took the PMP on 5/4/2012 and passed in just under 3 hours utilizing this text exclusively.<br />I marked about 20 questiond for review - and the lion share of those were either \\"tricky\\" or required serious math.<br />I have 10+ years managing projects (no help on the PMP what-so-ever, in fact my experience was a liability) in IT departments in various companies and thus came to process with considerable bias, particularly because all of my project management experience is in the IT field. Below was my study plan:<br />Allocated 3 months for the effort - during those three months: Mon-Friday read for 45 minutes during my lunch hour. Sat & Sun read for two hours each day in 4 30 minute segments. Read cover to cover - slowly,  seeking understanding and avoiding \\"passing words under my eyes\\" as we're all prone to do.  Memorized the formulas and other data they indicated that should be memorized.  Saved attempting the end of chapter questions until the final days of study. Then studied the answers I got wrong - this was VERY VALUABLE.<br />Thoughts on the text itself:<br />1. Not a boring read and actually held my attention. I enjoyed reading it and enjoyed LEARNING the information.<br />3. They take the time to explain WHY answers to questions are what they are, which for the PMP is invaluable because the test is all about application of knowledge and not memorization.<br /><br />My best study tips for this exam:<br />1. Study for real. This isn't a Microsoft exam - it's a serious test of the application of knowledge.<br />2. The test IS NOT about the PMBok. Read it - don't memorize it. You don't need to.<br />3  Learn the SEQUENCE of the processes of what to do/when/why and what you should end up with when done and nothing the exam  throws at you will trip you up.<br />4.PMP practice exams found on the WWW are useless. They vary wildly in content and teach you nothing. Worse - they may lull you into a false sense of exam familiarity. The real exam questions were nothing like samples I'd seen on the WWW.<br /><br />Good luck, Mark Payneing like samples I'd seen on the WWW.<br /><br />Good luck, Mark Payne

B0000X61VE|5.0|I love this workout - it is my top choice among all workouts after almost 30 years of trying these things. Bottom line: it works.  I lost 20 pounds many years ago doing this workout religiously (and then moved on to her Next Challenge, which is also great).  I keep coming back to it when I've gone lax and need to get in shape again.  The more I've learned about fitness over the years, the more I have come appreciate what Radu has done here. You get the perfect amount of higher interval training (mostly in the 2nd workout), combined with strength/resistance training.  I never get bored, and I don't say this just because Cindy looks good! What's great about Cindy is that it's like working out with a girlfriend - there's a girl-next-door niceness to her - not the condescension you sometimes get with workout video people.  She's really quite lovely.  Yes, all the safety concerns they say about this workout are true - you can't fly around like Cindy does and her form is awful sometimes.  But if you stick to proper form in the exercise and don't overextend yourself, these are great workout moves.

B004WOS3P4|1.0|I was pretty excited to get my hands on David Cook's new CD \\"This Loud Morning\\".  Once again - major disappointment.<br /><br />I don't get, and apparently neither do the folks at American Idol.  They have a rich trove of talent that is introduced to America each year and each year with pretty much each person, (a few exceptions), they manage to screw it up royally.  David (love this guy) is probably the most pronounced example of the inability of American Idol machine to \\"get it\\".<br /><br />Here is the process.  The fans fall in love with these kids every year.  The judges keep telling them to \\"be yourself\\" and to \\"change it up\\".  Then the season is over and American Idol's leaders dismantle the excellent groundwork that has been laid by making poor choices and turning the kids into one horse acts and riding that horse into the ground.<br /><br />Here is what I mean.  Take a stack of CDs by ANY of the Idols (I will use David as my best example).  Each song is a formula and each song sounds the same. For David:<br />1) Song starts with upbeat tempo (every time)<br />2) David starts to sing in a reasonably pleasant voice  (every time)<br />3) 2-3 bars later, David goes up an octave, starts to \\"scream sing\\" and the band turns into a very loud wall of sound  (every time)<br />4) Song goes up and down as verses play out  (every time)<br />5) Song ends relatively softly  (every time)<br /><br />Every song on every CD by David is the same song per the above.  The melody differs, but the formula is the same.  This guy was my favorite idol of all time.  Strong controlled voice, big range, incredible nuances, great creativity.  I am desperate to find a CD where the formula is broken and he doesn't scream sing every song.  Scream sing = no purchase.  Hopefully, they will allow this guy to break out and use his creativity with different tempos, less scream singing and more nuances.  He has the whole package; curious as to why they won't let him use it.  He garnered the most votes to win Idol through variety.  Why would they ignore that and make him a one trick formula.
0385523912|5.0|\\"Nothing to Envy\\" has a perfect balance of emotional attachment and historical information.  I can't stop thinking about the people whose lives were covered in the book. Ms. Demick's writing is clear and informative.  She obviously cares about her subjects.  And her knowledge about the North Korean government is evident.  I highly recommend this book for anybody who wishes to learn more about North Korea.
B003FXCSNQ|3.0|It's a shame that this version is not clearly marked as having been modified by others. I only found out about that by checking a review before doing this one. Shame on you Amazon. On top of that, is the cost. I cannot believe that I can quite easily buy this version/book far cheaper as a paperback ... new too. I got all excited after seeing Philip K. Dick featured recently on the TV doco - Prophets Of Science Fiction. I thought I had the book in my extensive collection, but alas no. I then thought great, something new I can get for the Kindle ... that and at least three other books by him. I could not believe the price they are. I want to stop buying paper versions, but I'm now being forced to go that route anyway. Shame on you Amazon. Only consolation, is that I can get the real unmolested versions.
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|Time and again, Charles Dickens was asked to write an autobiography, but the fear of revisiting painful childhood memories prevented him from doing so.  The closest he ever got to writing about his youth was in \\"David Copperfield\\", in which he recounts the life of a young man (closely modelled on himself), who is thwarted by cruel circumstance but ultimately transformed by love and fortune.<br /><br />The idyllic childhood of young David Copperfield (played as a child by Daniel Radcliffe and for the remainder of the miniseries by Ciaran McMenamin) comes to a crashing end, when his beautiful, widowed mother Clara (Emilia Fox) decides to marry Mr Murdstone (Trevor Eve).  Hovering like a pair of destructive vultures, Murdstone and his sister (Zoe Wanamaker) pack David off to a macabre boarding school and subsequently drive heartbroken Clara into an early grave.<br /><br />Now orphaned, David goes to work at Murdstone's blacking factory in London, where he is taken under-wing by Mr Micawber (Bob Hoskins), a charming rogue who is constantly in demand with the debt-collectors.  Realising David's precarious place as a lone child in London, Micawber urges him to seek out his only living relative - Aunt Betsey Trotwood (Dame Maggie Smith), who lives with her eccentric companion Mr Dick (Ian McNeice) in Dover.  Horrified Betsey assumes legal guardianship of David once she learns of the Murdstones' abuse, and determines to raise him as a young gentleman of great prospects.  Back in London, he trains as a clerk, but is sidetracked by his infatuation for the lovely Dora Spenlow (Joanna Page).<br /><br />As the threads and figures of David's childhood begin to mingle and merge in his current life (often with heartbreaking and disastrous results), David must find a way to reconcile the events of the past in order to find happiness in the future.<br /><br />This most delightful, soul-stirring and often intensely moving of Dickens' works is given a solid screen treatment in the BBC's masterful 1999 2-part miniseries.  I cannot find a single fault, except perhaps that I wished it was longer!  The BBC's literary and costume dramas are often amongst the best of the best, and here, their casting department has gone into overdrive, furnishing the production with an extensive gallery of talents from stage and screen to portray the roster of Dickens creations - Pauline Quirke as Peggotty, Imelda Staunton as Mrs Micawber, Dawn French as Mrs Crupp, Nicholas Lyndhurst as Uriah Heep, Alun Armstrong as Dan Peggotty and Sir Ian McKellan as Creakle, to name just a few.<br /><br />Just a year away from his \\"Harry Potter\\" superstardom, Daniel Radcliffe gives a lovely performance as young David with a deep feeling for the part (the keyhole scene with Peggotty is heartbreaking).  Ciaran McMenamin's bookending older David is just as delightful.  Dame Maggie Smith was born to play Aunt Betsey and you'll want to stand up and cheer when she cuts the Murdstones' down to size!<br /><br />A master-class in how to adapt a classic novel and make it fresh again for the small screen, this DAVID COPPERFIELD is one to treasure.  My highest recommendation.s masterful 1999 2-part miniseries.  I cannot find a single fault, except perhaps that I wished it was longer!

B0044XRIMW|5.0|Forget you modern day, cheesy dance flick, American Idol starring crap musical movies!  Wow!  That's all I can say about this movie in one word.  I love this movie!  This seriously is an amazing story, based on a freakin' true story might I add!  Loved it!  Had everything: children in their innocent youth, a young woman becoming a lady, a sad man who didn't know what he had, and to top it off, a war!  For those who have never seen this movie before, I say to you:  What the f--- are you waiting for?  Seriously, this movie will move you, if not, become your top 10 movies of all time.  Don't be ratchet!
B002L4QP0M|2.0|Have you ever come across a movie that you loved in your youth and watched it again, only to find out that what you had enjoyed so much had become trite?  This is what I thought of this book, so much so that I put it down (which I have done less than 10 times in my life.  The narrative is stilted and maybe it is an American vs Brit thing but I also felt it was amateurish.Don't get me wrong, I have read may Archer novels and loved \\"As the Crow Flies\\" which I read several times and recommended to family. But I kept thinking about the believably and boneheadedness of the dialogue and realized I just didn't care. At All.

Not much for playing with, but a total must have for any Star Wars fan.<br /><br />WOW.  This thing could have easily been $500, and probably will go to $1,000 in a few years.

0525478817|5.0|I loved the plot. It had me laughing hysterically, then flooding in tears. It was really emotional and it was definitely a good read, although it only lasted me 4 hours. The covers are in great condition, and i was especially impressed when I realized it was a signed copy.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very cool game one of the best games. out there very addictive ....cool graphics ...cool action and bosses....two thumbs. up
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game to play to pass time. Great game to make you strategize and think rather than just run through the stages and beat the game in a day. Love the upgrades and the levels of difficulty. Great job GLU!!!!
B0076UXKDG|3.0|When I get my D800E I will want a grip for it, but I will not buy Nikon's. I have an MB-D10 on my D700 and love it, but it only cost $230 and it took my frame rate up to 8fps since I also own a D2H and have many EN-EL4 and 4a batteries.  Hopefully there will be third party grips when my D800E arrives (hopefully this year!!!).
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is so addictive and its free so for those people who like animated zombie games get this game!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|\\"Defending Jacob\\" is a story many people will relate to.  It is suspenseful and well written.  It goes through the murder of a young man, charges brought against Jacob and the procecution and defense of young Jacob.  For anyone who has known an autistic child or a child with personality disorders, you will find this story very interesting.  The character background and descriptions are excellent.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age village  is a fun stratagey game with clips of the movie and lots of animals from the ice age.
0143038583|4.0|I *finally* finished this book! For me, it was not a quick read, and I could only read so much at a time before taking a break. Also, I've been very busy and just haven't made the time to read as much as I would have liked to. That being said, this book was incredibly interesting to me. Certain parts got very technical, but overall, I learned so much from this book. I would definitely recommend reading this if you have ever wondered where your food comes from. I think you'd be surprised by some of the information in the book.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Perfect tool of WiFi science :)  This taught me a lot about my network that I didn't know before, and has turned my Kindle fire into a tech support tool :)
0307269981|1.0|Ok, so I read this & the first book because of all the excitement about it.  This type of writing appeals to those who need to blame someone else for their faulty potty training that has led them to believe they've been victimized and therefore are deserving of pity.  I have some words of advice:  suck it up; be a mensch; get over it; stop blaming others for your crappy life; grow up; be responsible for your own life and your own actions; stop expecting someone to bail you out after you screw up.<br /><br />The writing is terrible, the translation is seriously lacking; the book glorifies perversion, immorality, corruption, selfishness and immaturity in the extreme.
B004HUE57S|5.0|After having wrist pain for a while, I decided to get a vergical mouse. It wasn't an Evoluent, but was another highly recommended brand (I can't remember which). It helped me considerably, but unfortunately the quality was poor and it broke relatively quickly.<br /><br />I felt conflicted because I didn't want to buy another one, just to have it break again. So I went without a vertical mouse for a while. All the while, I could feel the difference in my wrist. The tension was increasing again, and my wrist was starting to ache. It was only a matter of time before that escalated into outright pain again.<br /><br />After doing more research and reading reviews of the Evoluent, I decided to give it a try. It's one of the best electronics purchases I ever made. My wrist aches went away very quickly, and this mouse is far more comfortable than any other I've ever used.<br /><br />On top of that, I've dropped it multiple times and it continues to work wonderfully. Supposedly it actually has features like programmable buttons and stuff, but that's not what I bought it for. The default out-of-the-box functionality and configuration works perfectly for my needs.
1439127700|5.0|My only criticism of this wonderful tome is that there are not more stars to rate this book...I would have given it ten stars if I could.  Just an enigmatic tour through the passages of history, and of the exclusive league of gentelmen who have served the highest office in the land.  It is not preachy, nor does it take sides liberal v. conservative in any respect.  A very objective and even-handed look at how president's have included and precluded former president's from participation in the executive realm, and how (ultimately) time heals all wounds for the men whose souls have occupied the Oval Office.  Just first-rate.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|This movie was just so wonderful. It tore my heart out. I also read the book which I absolutely loved. Tom Hanks has to be one of the finest actors around today.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it has great &ccedil;oncept and it also has a lot of options in gameplay but the only downfall is that it needs time to play
B0053B347M|3.0|For biased lighting levels, the back wall should be painted a completely neutral gray with a reflectivity of around 18%, and the biased lighting reflecting off the wall should be at a level that is 10% of the brightest white light that your monitor can produce. Use a spot meter.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Not sure how this rates 4stars. I agee with all glitchy comments. Loved this game for a week. Now I need to uninstall it because it tells me all my buildings ready to collect,  but nothing happens.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up watching the Star Wars trilogy every weekend. When it was over, my sister and I often began watching it again. We had it on Laserdisc, and it was awesome. This is not what I watched.<br /><br />I don't understand. I would watch the original all the time. I would pay whatever the price. If they released in the theaters once a year, I would go every year. Star Wars needs to come back. Restored, fine. Altered, no.
0345803485|1.0|This book is further proof of the dumbing down of America. It was so poorly written that it was hard to get through the entire book. I believe the people who like this book 1. Are huge Twilight fans, 2. don't read much, or 3. need to get more action.<br /><br />The dialogue was stilted and full of Britishisms! Honestly, it felt like, aside from the subject matter, it was written at a 3rd grade reading level.<br /><br />Kudos to the author, though, for figuring out how to make millions from total trash. Talent is clearly not a prerequisite for publishing success.

I mean, you can pick your nickname, but cant pick a different pic for your profile? that's the only let down. but still loving the game.
B007549W62|3.0|worst case scenario,worst reactions,surprise ending<br />it makes you take a second look at your neighbors<br />not a bad movie but,would have preferred a closer to<br />middle of the road approach,my boyfriend didn't like<br />it,to many extremes

B0006GAOJA|5.0|Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are absolutely brilliant as a pair of brothers in the streets of New York City who get drawn into the violent world of boxing. This is based on the life of Jake LaMotta, known as \\"Raging Bull\\" or \\"The Bronx Bull\\". You can hear that gritty upbringing in their accents, see it in the chain-link-fenced public pool, and when you hear that Jake was forced by his father to fight for money as a kid, you know just how rough this life could be.<br /><br />De Niro channels that inner range and shows it spectacularly. This isn't a quiet Rocky character who mulls over things and wants the wall-flower girl. Jake has had a hard life and he deserves something better. He mistreats his feisty girlfriend until a nubile blonde catches his eye - then it's out with the old, in with the new, and soon enough he's treating his new wife just as poorly. He mistrusts everyone around him, including his brother, who he accuses of being too close with his wife. Apparently in real life it was a best friend who he had that fight with, but it's understandable that they want to compress storylines for the movie's sake.<br /><br />Yes, the boxing scenes are violent. I don't feel at all that they were gratuitous. Rather, I get a strong sense that the movie is being a \\"documentary\\" and showing what it was like. Jake's strength was that he wouldn't go down. He could take the beating and remain on his feet. Pummeling that would have destroyed weaker men could not take him out.<br /><br />The movie is also straightforward about Jake's flaws. This isn't a Rocky-style \\"he was a hero\\" story. It looks straight on at the things Jake did wrong along the way. Yes, Jake threw a fight - he had admitted it. He wasn't good to the people in his life.<br /><br />While the characters are flawed, I think De Niro and Pesci are both superb at bringing them to life in a realistic way. De Niro's weight gain is fairly impressive, from the beginning to the end of the movie. Apparently he became an awesome boxer as well. That's dedication to one's craft.<br /><br />As one might expect, the movie is all about Men and the World of Men. Women, if shown, are either being lusted after or beaten up on, and rarely do we even know what their names are. We might have had two named women in the wives of the two brothers, but I don't think they even ever talk with each other. So that's a shame, to not get more of a sense of any sort of a relationship. Unless that really was all those men ever did with women their entire lives.<br /><br />Still, an interesting insight into the world of Bronx boxing.awesome boxer as well.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have to literally drag my Kindle out of my son's hands after I let him play this game.  I didn't understand the pull until recently - aiming a bird and launching it to take down some pigs. Over and over again.  Weird.  But then I played, and I'm hooked too!  There are so many levels and settings, each with its own particular challenges.  The backgrounds are very nicely done, and the music is cute.  Now we get to fight with each other over who gets to play!

B004FOA84A|5.0|For all those folks wanting the real scoop - listen up.  Have you ever read reviews for a movie and then asked yourself if you should see the movie based on negative input?  I am always amazed after seeing a good movie, when it recieved bad reviews.  I am fairly new to the Kindle Fire and have purchased a few \\"Dud\\" apps.<br /><br />This is NOT one of them!  Flat out a lot of fun.  Will buy more from this designer.  Later.
1439175640|1.0|I bought this cookbook after falling in love with the vanilla cupcake with buttercream frosting from the bakery.  The frosting tasted nothing like the bakeries, or even buttercream for that matter.  It called for 8-10 cups of powdered sugar, and that's what it tasted like, just watered down powdered sugar, i couldn't even get the frosting to stay on the cupcakes.  I had to throw these humiliating cupcakes away before anyone took a bite!  I've tried contacting the company, but no response.  See if I ever go to magnolias again!
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Despite the poor reviews, I thought i'd give the film a chance, mainly due to the all star cast. I was so wrong.<br />The acting was mediocre at best, the dialogue was overly simplified, the plot was all over the place, and worst of all, the constant cutting to different angles in generally unimportant scenes was irritating. I wish i could get my money back.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My son and I play this together. He loves to play it too. I would reccomend it. Ilike how it changes and challenges you to think differently with each screen.

Harrist is an author who brings cynical intelligence to his work & The Fear Index is an entertainingly disturbing take on how things might work.
0618918248|5.0|Just a short opinion to counter the persistently unenlightened negatives who I doubt made it past the first chapter, Prof Dawkins makes his point in respectful language, well written and absolutely convincingly. There is no god - at least not in the bearded-skyman delusion.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Whenever the subject comes along concerning the most provocative and exciting science fiction novels, nothing comes to mind faster than Ender's Game. Having been written close to 30 years ago, nothing yet has come along that matches it in terms of craft and character. Mr. Card has constructed the most revolutionary science fiction story this side of Starship Troopers and the quality of sub sequential books such as Xenocide, Ender's Shadow and Speaker for the Dead only reinforce the idea that Orson Scott Card is THE science fiction writer of our time.

0393088774|5.0|In case you haven't read anything lately about the Great Depression, how did we get out of that one? Essentially it was the massive torrents of money the government spent on producing new products(in that case-armaments)at the beginning of World War II which yanked the whole country out. Did we worry about borrowing money to finance it? Hell, no! The government's duty(!) in hard times is to buy products and services and hire, hire, hire! Our infrastructure of highways and bridges is crumbling across the U.S. Let's get it back up to par! Have we forgotten what government gives us? Has everybody forgotten the highway system built under the Republican President, Eisenhower, that we use to travel and transport the things we buy? Just out of curiosity what was the tax on the rich in those days? The stock market doesn't put people to work. It is demand for housing, clothing, food, etc. which keep those shops and companies busy, Instead we are laying off government workers left and right and cutting government spending. What kinds of goods and services are the unemployed buying? What taxes are they paying? Are they shopping for clothes, buying food and homes, eating at restaurants? When a formerly unemployed person gets a job there is a ripple effect which creates employment in every sector of the market that they buy goods or services from. The sales tax that they pay gives more money to the states where they live. The basic idea is so simple. Krugman's book covers these and other bases-giving you insight into how our economy works and how we can get it rolling again!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a well written novel that takes a normally difficult and upsetting topic and treats it carefully. The result, somewhat upsetting to be reminded of the horrors, but so well balanced against the rest of the plot, that you are kept hopeful to the end. Good read.
0618918248|3.0|I have just completed reading the book for the first time, over three days, and have found it an interesting experience.  There is much I agree with and that is no surprise because as an evangelical Anglican there is much in other denominations and religions that I disagree with, both in belief and practice.<br /><br />What I was expecting in the book was a much more powerful attempt to argue against the existence of God than there actually is.  It was intriguing to read at the beginning of the second chapter, the chapter where the argument against God really gets under way, an excellent example of begging the question.  In the very first sentence the author writes \\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character of all ficton...\\"  Throwing in the word \\"arguably\\" does not help much in avoiding the charge of begging the question.<br /><br />The question-begging of course is in the word \\"fiction\\".  Not only does the author affirm his belief that the stories of Adam and Noah and so on are made up.  He seems to ignore the fact that much of the Old Testament is accepted as being at least as correct historically as most ancient documents as well as assumning at the beginning of his argument what should come as one of his conclusions, if at all.<br /><br />I agree with Dr Dawkins that many attitudes of Islam and Roman Catholicism and American evangelicalism are harmful.  I agree that purgatory is a ridiculous concept, both from  human and theological points of view.  These strange or dangerous beliefs do not have any bearing on the question of whether God exists.<br /><br />Dr Dawkins is at times very amusing and sometimes writes with compassion and understanding.  At other times he is arrogant, such as when he in effect likens the acceptance of child sacrifice in the past to the loving teaching of modern Christian parents.  True Christian believers do not accept cultural excuses for outrageous practices but they do believe that they are duty bound to teach their children the precepts of their faith (they are going to teach them something anyway by words and example).  Some of our children keep the faith as teenagers and adults and some don't.  We love them and accept them just the same.<br /><br />We might wonder if Dr Dawkins has children and if so, are they atheists?  If they are we, on his reasoning, should be very suspicious.<br /><br />Another feature of the book is the frequency with which \\"straw men\\" appear.  They are perhaps real men but in the context of \\"these are the ways Bible-believing Christians behave\\" they are  clearly straw men and women and not people who follow New Testament teaching.  Their actions and words are not evidence that God does not exist as well as not being evidence of how people who genuinely follow Bible teaching behave.<br /><br />Dr Dawkins seems surprised that God would regard non-belief in himself as a serious sin.  It is the most serious sin and all atheists should think about that.  But now I am following the author's example and preaching.  Enough of that.<br /><br />A final comment is on the treatment of the New Testament.  Dr Dawkins concentrates on Christianity in his discussion and that renders his dismissive attitudes to the New Testament more odious than they may otherwise have been.  In a few pages he manages to bypass a multitude of textual analysts, historians, linguists, Bible commentators, papyrologists and others who have put in the hard work on the biblical documents.  No comment at all would have been better than the superficial treatment found in the book.
B0079XNWQA|1.0|I have to agree with the reviewer who said this was a lazy production of a CD. I have been a HUGE fan of Jason Mraz but if this is what we can look forward to in the future he's lost me as a fan...he has betrayed his art. It is musically lazy and lyrically lazy. I have listened to it 5 times to make sure I'm not missing something & the 5th time decided it was so irritating I trashed it. Maybe a week later I saw him on Bravo. & he came off as really arrogantly which is the opposite of how he was when I saw him in Atlanta last tour. That was a very spiritual & upliftimg, musically interesting concert.  I can only surmise his fame has made him arrogant & complacent. Maybe life will dish out some humble pie to him & we'll get back the artist of substance who cultivates his gift. Hope so I miss that guy
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Wow... this product is NOT of a good, lasting quality. I purchased it from a authorized Zagg dealer/installer in the Brandon Town Center Mall, in Brandon (Tampa), Florida. I know the product has a 45 money back guarantee, but bought it Oct (mid) and that would end in Jan... yes, there is a lifetime replacement of product, but NOT installation cost (by them)...<br />PROBLEM: The product, within 3-5 months, has pealed up on ALL sides, will NOT restick/adhere down to glass (speaking of back only, I have Power Supports anti-glare on front and LOVE it) it has stretched, and plain and simply sucks... so WHY would I want another FREE one, that won't last more than 3-5 months?!? Ripping it off, and replacing with Power Support's crystal BACK film, they sell on their site (not in Apple)... only 13.00 for TWO.<br />SAFE YOUR MONEY... don't buy this product, go right to Power Supports Site, I've had ALL of the iPhones (since they came out) and NEVER had any troubles with their product, ever... and now that they make the back, I'm SO getting theirs and can assure you I won't have to replace it in 3-5 months!

B0071DJZZA|4.0|It was good, gave a good insight to a third world country, it was interesting to read and riveting, but you need to be into the book else it's not a good read.<br />Made me want to read the rest of the books! :)
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book certainly lived up to the hype that has been in the media. It's a very well written gripping title that has you reading it every spare minute you have. You get drawn into the characters and fall in love with them. A fantastic first of three.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is a story about war, politics, depression, mental illness, and most importantly human loss and how we deal with it.<br /><br />Don't let this scare you away from appreciating an incredible story.  Collins' strength is her ability to make us feel empathy for her characters.  The separation of the tributes is just so real, and we feel for Katniss and Finnick as they fret about the fate of their loved ones.<br /><br />I've noticed many negative reviews of this book, but I also note that many of the positive reviews were written by veterans and those who have lived long enough to experience the tragic loss of a loved one.<br /><br />The ending is befitting.  We're reminded by Katniss and Peeta that healing takes time.  Monuments are made, but the best memorial to those who lost their lives fighting the Capitol is the scrap book sealed by \\"salt water\\" and the promise to enjoy the peace that was purchased by their lives.  Even the hardened Haymitch shows signs of healing as he contributes his memories to the book.<br /><br />Collins' book is a touching reminder that we must honor our veterans, teach our children to acknowledge and fight injustice, and to reach out to comfort those who have suffered the loss of a loved one.<br /><br />WK

B000002LEM|4.0|This album was released at a certain time in my life when I was a young and reckless man - nonetheless it was a period where I did enjoy myself and the circles I moved in. 'Mine all Mine' is a great track and in some ways sounds kind of 'futuristic'...then we have 'When its love' 'AFU' and 'Cabo Wabo'<br /><br />For me the second half of the album tapers off but I will always love the first few songs, for my own reasons. I look forward to a remastered version as I've always thought the sound could have been a bit better, but overall 4 stars for me. Easily beats albums like 'Diver Down', 'Fair warning', 'Women and Children First' and is better than at least 'Balance' of the Hagar era.

0143119680|1.0|Trite. Vapid. Dull. While the writing is mediocre and acceptable at best, the plot and characters are seriously lacking and underdeveloped. I read into the tenth chapter and couldn't push myself to read any further. The soporific personalities of the heroine and her vampire love interest debase the already terrible storyline, and their interactions will quickly and surely pull you into a slumber. As for the writing, grammar is good, but lacks style. Too much useless dialogue and there is an obvious absence of alluring descriptions FOR EVERYTHING. All I read is how perrrrrfect and handsome Mister Matthew Clairmont is. Sounds like another vampire we all know...but even Stephenie Meyer did a better job in securing a decent plot, even if her character development needs a bit of work. At least it was readable. A Discovery of Witches is NOT. I was expecting something more grand from a USC professor, but I guess I should have been smarter in my assumptions. Credentials does not mean one has the gifted ability to tell a good story.Do yourself a favor and pick up another book.
B007SSDS24|1.0|What else can I say? Acting was terrible. Script was terrible. Production was terrible. I've not a good thing to say about this terrible movie.
B004LWZW24|4.0|I normally don't get scared from PG-13 movies (last one that did that was Signs) but Insidious had me freaked out at parts which was very refreshing. Although the longer the movie goes on the scares start to dwindle until the ending which I thought I could predict, but it was two steps ahead of me and provided a nice chilling twist.<br /><br />So in the beginning one of the kids is comatose in a bedroom and the mom is starting to suspect there's a supernatural element in effect, while the dad is dismissing everything as ridiculous. Rose Byrne is excellent by the way, she was great in Bridesmaids and she's great in this, I hope to see her in more roles. Before the ghost specialists or whoever come into the picture the movie is at it's scariest, I don't remember feeling such a chill down my spine after hearing Tiny Tim in this movie (well before Darth Maul is listening to it).<br /><br />The ghost specialists are called into the job, one sweet old psychic lady and her two assistants which look like two Mormon hipsters. They're kind of played for comic effect but the scares were still present and the story ups the ante a bit. After that though the dad goes in the 'ghost world', and lots of people didn't like this bit. I didn't mind it however, it was mysterious and the smiling family bit was pretty creepy, but when the dad got in a fist-fight with a ghost that was pretty damn stupid. The ending where the dad finds his son held captive by darth maul that was kind of a dumbed down chase scene as well.<br /><br />The director and writers know how to maintain atmosphere and tension very well, which is kind of a rarity these days in horror. So while that was good the ending was dumbed down to a fist fight, I don't know if it was an argument with the producers about the final act or something but it just felt jarring after such a good 2/3rds that some really dumb decisions were made near the end. The VERY ending twist though was great.<br /><br />Even though it's really not that great a movie it is a refreshingly old fashioned chiller of a horror movie, perfect for Halloween time.that great a movie it is a refreshingly old fashioned chiller of a horror movie, perfect for Halloween time.

B005CMSDLE|3.0|(Three and a half)<br /><br />The last movie I saw by the same director was Atonement, and it left a similar feeling with me that Hanna did where the story is pretty bland, but the visuals/sounds are fantastic. Well this bourne knockoff is more of the same, although it definately has more entertainment value than Atonement. The premise is very basic that would normally make for your typical bland PG-13 'thriller' that gets pinched out every couple of weeks but not in this case, Hanna is very European flavored which makes it more of an oddity.<br /><br />The story is Hanna's living with her dad in the middle of nowhere (I think they were in Greenland) and he's teaching her very extreme survival methods, and tells her that whenever she's ready (not sure for what exactly) to push a comical red button. When she does she get's captured by the CIA(I think?) and escapes, with an agency on her tail, and all sorts of life lessons for Hanna are learned between each ass kicking. I've seen this movie about three times now and the story has vague parts that have me still scratching my head.<br /><br />I went into this movie knowing nothing more than the cover so it was kind of a cool suprise that this wasn't Joan of Arc or something, that it took place in modern times, but when the story starts going along there's a lot of dumb action cliches you see (for example when she grabs onto the bottom of a truck going like 60mph in the middle of the rugged desert). A couple of things in the movie were just pretty bizarre as well, like the German bounty hunter who's played out to be some sadistic badass gets his ass whooped in like 2 seconds, the out-of-leftfield lesbian moment, and the British family that Hanna tags along with meet a suprisingly gruesome fate for a PG-13 movie. The ending is kind of abrupt too but I liked how it went full circle.<br /><br />So that's all the bad things about Hanna out of the way, lets talk about the good things, the shots are great, the cinematography was excellent as the film took you all over the place. The acting was alright, nothing really incredible but the kids weren't lousy actors this time which was nice. The visuals get pretty surreal at parts too, especially at the old hippie guy's house which was interesting. Some of the shots are simply brilliant as well, the strongest anti-piracy message I've ever seen was simply the subway fight scene, the build up, the music, the subtle visual cues, and of course the lightning fast choreography, all of it was fantastic.<br /><br />I'm also a big Chemical Brother's fan, but strangely enough didn't know they did the soundtrack until after I saw the movie, and I'd say they did a great job with the soundtrack. They didn't overdo their role by just adding more dance songs but actually did atmosphere which worked out great for them, to this day I still can't get 'The Devil's in the Details' out of my head.<br /><br />So Hanna's a rather strange Euro-action film, it wants so bad to be your typical American action film and yet it's just so weird that it can't be, and I suspect that it has a strong cult following since it wasn't a huge hit with normal audiences. That being said if you have an appreciation for styalized film, than you will enjoy Hanna, just don't put too much thought into the story. Another interesting thing is when I saw Hanna for the second time enebriated and the experience was much more rewarding with the brain turned off. Let's hope next time Joe Wright hires a better screen writer though.as excellent as the film took you all over the place.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I would give the first 2 books 5 stars and this one also, but the ending was just an end. It left so many questions. I hope there is another book to read about how they said goodbye to Gale. Maybe some about the wedding. And most of all, leading up to the kids. I'm waiting another book otherwise this was a big disappointment.

Guess I'll have to buy it for him now!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm giving this a guarded recommendation because their other game - Oregon Trail - stopped working right after I gave it a 5* review.  I hope that doesn't happen with this one.  So based on game play it's great but based on developers it's lukewarm at best.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised.  No, it's not great literature, and yes, the characters could have been better drawn, and yes, maybe there's a little too much tell and not enough show, but...I enjoyed it, and I'm picky about what I read.  I found the writing about on the same level as The Hunger Games (and WAY WAY WAY above Twilight and 50 Shades).  The plot was believable, the characters likable (or fantastically evil), the pacing pretty good, and an unexpected, satisfying ending.  I gave it only four stars for the previously mentioned \\"telling, not showing\\" problem (I'm sure the author's writing will mature here) and because it got a little too politically correct at times (all the \\"right\\" characters are mentioned, all the \\"right\\" attitudes displayed - quit taking yourself so seriously, dude) and because there were some gratuitous scenes/language/dialogue that sounded like they were written by a 10-year-old boy on a dare.<br /><br />Fun, easy read.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|The only exciting thing about this movie is seeing the hot actresses running around in tight jeans! I'd give 5/5 stars for that, less 1 star for the disappointing anti-climax. At the closing scene, I'm still left wondering if ... { CENSORED since some prospective viewers prefer not to know how a movie ends ... sorry! } ... The last scene leaves too much room for speculation on possible future events relating to the characters.<br /><br />There isn't enough action or suspense in this movie, just a handful of humans running around, trying to hide, and figuring out how to outwit somewhat invisible alien invaders.<br /><br />Recommended viewing:<br /><br />Go back in time with actress Sigourney Weaver to watch how she deals with aliens!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Claire Danes - she's the primary reason why I'm watching this series. She stars as Carrie Mathison, a highly strung, pill-popping CIA counter-terrorism officer on a mission to undercover a mole that that turned by the enemy. She set her sights on Sgt. Nicholas Brody, a US Marine who has been rescued after spending 8 years in captivity. The TV series takes it on from there.<br /><br />Who cares about how this series ends?<br /><br />If Claire Danes is on screen, I'm tuning in! In this series, she looks so sizzling in that grey suit, her hair is so pristine, her makeup is flawless, she looks so adorable even when acting angry, what else would I need to know about the plot?

Good show!!!  Now will a record company please put some of Winwood or Traffic's albums out in a higher resolution format please (DVD-Audio or SACD)?!?  Thanks!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|My son told me about this book.  I respect his judgement in things like this, so I read it, and as usual, the kid was right on.  This is, frankly, the best memoir of war I have ever read, and I have read every one I can find.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this short.  I'm a veteran of two wars, 35 years apart, and never went through anything even remotely like what Sledge describes.  His descriptions of his experiences lets me know in no uncertain terms what his generation went through, and the crap us baby boomers suffered in our wars (bad as it was) ain't ca ca compared to it.<br /><br />One example:  On Okinawa, in their foxholes, they had no place to put their feces, so they just tossed their waste out of the foxhole.  Mounds of human waste combined with rotting corpses must have made for a smell the likes of which few humans have ever experienced.<br /><br />They didn't sleep, too much noise and stress, with the constant threat of Japanese infiltrators at night keeping them on edge.<br /><br />As I read this, the inhuman, unbearable conditions our Marines lived through (and died under) came home to me in a stark manner, once and for all, raising the hair on the back of my head, in a way no other account of war had ever done.  That is the power of Gene Sledge's work.  Simple, stark, and hitting to your very core.  His description of the utter sorrow and dejection the loss of the beloved \\"Ack Ack\\", their Company Commander, had on his unit brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Read this superb work.  You won't be sorry.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|When I first read the plot summary, I wasn't sure I'd like this movie, but with such a high rating, I decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />First, the acting -- especially the boys playing the brothers when they were young -- was amazing. They really portrayed an extraordinary, authentic and carefree love for each other, that it made everyone around them aware of the relative lack in their relationships. And this was long before adulthood, when their expression evolved to include sex. Around them, the parents and the housekeeper all created a believable, yet incredibly rare environment of unconditional love for these two boys -- even as they worried about what the relationship could become in the future.<br /><br />The thing that is most \\"sensational\\" about this story is the incest element. But reducing their relationship down to this would be like describing Steve Jobs as a filmmaker -- true, but by no means sufficient. It was not until after the boys were adults, and their world changed dramatically with the death of their mother, that they felt the liberation to add the sexual expression of love to a relationship that had already been emotionally exclusive their entire lives. The mother's death affected every family member in different ways, but for the boys, it made obvious what had always been there for each other -- according to the narrator, both love and longing.<br /><br />But what stayed with me the most was how the mother and the father of the younger brother loved their kids no matter what. It made me think of Christian parents who cannot accept that their kids are gay. They could learn a tremendous amount from these parents. And so could many of us.<br /><br />When I first saw the sexual aspect of their relationship developing, I'm embarrassed to admit that I felt uncomfortable. Until I realized that these guys were aware that no one could truly understand what they had with each other; nor did they need that affirmation. Nor, had they ever. I actually experienced growth during the movie: Later, when it looked like one of them was exploring another relationship (with a woman, no less), I found myself saddened by it -- knowing that there was no way this new relationship could ever compare with over 20 years of emotional intimacy they'd had with each other.<br /><br />The movie won me over. I cannot recommend it more highly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Like both of the main characters in the trilogy are fond of saying: \\"Don't Over Think This!\\" It's a book for crying out loud!... and is supposed to be read for your enjoyment as entertainment! It is not meant to educate people about dom/sub relationships.<br /><br />It's simply a love story about two people. One, who has had a horrendous past that continues to haunt him (and his relationships) and has never experienced real soulful and sexual love before-but who is smart enough to see it when it is staring him in the face. Unfortunately,(and fortunately) he's a control freak and chases after his attraction, while trying to fight it at the same time.He's handsome, mega-rich and extremely sexually experienced.<br /><br />Another who has had very little relationship experience at all-but who's had a variety of role models: from a step-father who is the main stability in her life and a mom who can't seem to stay with the same husband for very long. She is strong, has an open heart...and is a clean canvas of learning when it comes to sexual experience.<br /><br />These three books are romantic, sexual, exciting.... and most of all, show us how the types of role models we have as children continues to influence for the rest of our lives. Unless we recognize and understand our 'issues' and work on changing the ones that need changing-we ALL bring them to the table whenever we have ANY type of relationship.<br /><br />There is a very 'different' type of dynamic going on between these two people and I for one, enjoyed reading about them!

B006SV2LWA|4.0|For the most part, this is terrific - a calmly-paced, and often genuinely unsettling look at the ease and speed with which a viral pandemic could spread across the globe, now that so many of us traverse it with such speed and regularity.  The ups are the performances - for the most part, the high-profile actors take a sober, realistic approach to their subject matter and carry the film beautifully;  also the script, which counterpoints the personal aspects of the illness and its impact on families, at the same time as a team of scientists race against the clock to understand the virus - as it mutates its way out of their grasp at every point.<br /><br />The downside, I'm sorry to say, was a ridiculous caricature of a conspiracy theorist blogger, played with an almost camp sense of overkill (and a bewilderingly bad and inexplicable Australian accent) by Jude Law.  In reality, the media aspect of this story is a fascinating one - how should the media act in a pandemic?  How do they convey the genuine seriousness of the situation without creating mass panic?  But it's barely touched upon here, instead allowing Law's ridiculous Tintin-esque cub scout to chase senior doctors around, bleating tructulantly in a silly accent.<br /><br />On the flipside, special mention should be given to Jennifer Ehle, who has a shamefully peripheral part as Ally Hextall, the key research viriologist coolly obsessed with isolating, and eventually immunising against, the virus.  Ehle brings a thrilling calm to the role; a scientists' quiet awe at the extraordinary sophistication of the virus she's tackling, and an equally understated confidence when discussing the virus with colleagues or in press conferences.  It's a beautiful handling of a small, but key, role and since so few others have mentioned her in amongst the higher profile actors, I think she warrants a very special commendation.<br /><br />There are no zombies, no shocks and horrors, so it will not appeal to the torture-porn crowd, or the horror movie afficionado.  Instead its a credible tackling of a potentially devastating issue - and all the more frightening because of it.

0345803485|2.0|HOW IN THE WORLD DID THIS BOOK GET SO POPULAR?! Don't buy into the hype. The writing is so amuture it's laughable. The heroine is so bland and boring. She has absouletly nothing going for her that I could see the hero falling for her. The characters aren't developed properly for you to have an interest in any of them. There is no substance whatsoever. I can't believe it! I feel like everyone got duped into this book somehow. It's all a big conspiracy. Don't buy into it. If you want to read better books along the same line then try [[ASIN:B007SFBPFY Knight (The Unfinished Hero Series)]] or [[ASIN:0985114606 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]]. Those are much better written books than this farce. I give it 2 stars just for the unique story line, but otherwise, this book is SOOOOOO OVER-RATED.

B006OFN0SE|2.0|Perhaps it was my own fault avoiding reviews, I never had high expectations and it is not the kind of movie I would go to a theater to see, but this fell even below by moderate expectations.<br /><br />So I went into thinking it would cover how he built the FBI, set the direction, and getting some of the inside view on how he leveraged his information, not how he sorted it, which really seemed to impress the writer and director. The movie touched on these things but a very light treatment, more like filler, well except how he arranged the infromation.<br /><br />I think they missed a opportunity to explore a person that was perhaps one of the most powerful men on the Planet, who was never elected, not rich, but armed only with the power of information, and the backing of the US Government.<br /><br />I can see how some would like it, I just had no interest in his personal life, as a person he really is not that interesting, what that person did with th4e FBI is very interesting to me.
B006WXHJVC|5.0|This is a good Blu-Ray release, I've been waiting for American Pie to be released because the DVD is very ugly, covered in specks. This Blu-Ray release removed most, if not all of the specks, and the movie has always looked ugly and had an odd color, like most 90s movies. Anyways, it's worth buying if the price is right.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have say that I started and stopped this book a few times at first.  Its gloomy post apocalyptic storyline moved slowly and seemed destined to grind - good thing I kept at it.  Hugh Howey is ruthless in the early parts of the book in creating characters, investing in their stories then killing them.  However, each character adds a building block to the story that only becomes apparent as the plot unfolds and in its course, leads one to a truly likable heroine who finally unravels the \\"threads\\" of this mystery.  After the first quarter, the story moves quickly, revealing new perspectives and new discoveries until the book is finished before one realizes it.<br /><br />Howey has developed a fascinating, complicated story and environment that is depressing, surprising and yet hopeful.  He has a great ability to build atmosphere and has used it to make the environment as much a character of the story as any of the individuals in the story.  I highly recommend this novel - buy the omnibus rather than each installment as I did.  You will want to read the whole thing.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Has all those&quot;odd&quot; sounds that we had to get used to when sleeping in different places. The train reminds me of grandma's. The vacuum cleaner and box fan were sounds i often feel asleep to as a toddler.  There's even an airplane sound clip.  oh, and the usual thunder storms and ocean waves as well.  Nice timer to control how long sounds play along with option to play continuously.  Nicely done!

B0079J28NW|1.0|I was most disappointed when the 'restored' dvd version came out a few years ago. The audio did not sync good with the visual, and worst of all, they eliminated the \\"A Day In the Life\\" musical chord from the end of the still-image sequence as the submarine travels from Pepperland, and replaced the chord with some loud obnoxious noise. YUK!!!<br /><br />And not only that, the 'restored' version has \\"Hey Bulldog\\" on it--talk about a momentum-breaker, a mood-breaker, and just totally wrong! Double yuk!!<br /><br />I had been so thrilled about the release of Yellow Submarine ever since I saw the PROPERLY restored \\"Help\\", that when I finally saw Yellow Submarine, is was most displeased. I lost count of how many times I have watched the VHS version. I watched the horrible dvd version only once; it now continues to collect dust.<br /><br />With the care it sounds like the studio is giving this film restoration project this time, perhaps this will be a better version. I will update this post after seeing the Bluray version.<br /><br />The movie itself gets 5 stars, the dvd version gets negative 5 stars.

If so, would you still want him?<br /><br />The most compelling part of the story is the obsessive relationship between Christian and Ana.  The S&M stuff was not as disturbing as I expected; Ana needed to learn that she could assert herself whenever an intolerable boundary was to be crossed.<br /><br />I had trouble putting this book down because I wanted to know what would happen next.
B001E75QH0|5.0|All 4 movies, plus a disc of extras?  For this price, it can't be beat!  I like that the discs are in the super skinny plastic cases and all 4 cases fit in the cardboard box.

B006RXQ1L6|3.0|I'm not a big fan of Broadway musicals brought to the big screen but \\"Chicago\\" truly amazed me because it signified the rebirth of movie musicals.<br /><br />I had the pleasure to watch the Broadway play one year before the movie's release and I was totally amazed by it; and I repeat, I'm not a fan of musicals.<br /><br />The plot is the less important thing in these kind of movies but \\"Chicago\\" has a witty, funny, and sexy plot that will get your attention.<br /><br />But let's be honest, we watch this movie for it's musical numbers and choreography. You won't be disappointed because every single musical number is spectacular and very well done.<br /><br />When this ends, Zellweger has an argument which leads to the man she had sex with abusing her. She pulls out a gun and kills him in a fit of rage. She gets arrested and ends up in a woman's prisoner led by Queen Latifah. Much of the movie makes up of the actresses' lip singing (which can be seen very clearly) and wearing exotic costumes that make them look like whores. So I think to myself, is this supposed to be about a woman imprisoned and trying to prove her innocence, or a bunch of bad singing and sexual immorality? Or, a movie that's about the glorification of women killing man and saying it's okay?
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw a book at my daughter-in-law's and asked what she was reading.  My granddaughter said \\"That's mine, Gram.  It's the \\"Hunger Games\\", would you like to read it?\\"  I said yes, not knowing it was for teens.  I was hooked by the first chapter and could not put it down.  I was at the lake when I finished it and did not want to wait to borrow the second book, \\"Catching Fire\\", so I downloaded it on my Kindle.  It was as good as the first book.  It is a fast read and of course I had to know how things turned out and got the third bood as well.  It is good reading for all ages.
B007V9YF5E|3.0|Okay, okay I admit I did a bad thing by missing this movie when it was in theaters. I've watched Gina Carano in many Mixed Martial Arts events and always thought she would translate well in a movie as a kick-ass agent of destruction. We were teased by her cameo appearance in 2009's B-classic Blood and Bone as a street fighter. Tell me when she gave Isaiah Bone (main: Michael Jai White) her number- you weren't hoping she'd be seen again.<br /><br />And so, when a trailer emerges that shows Gina Carano doing the CIA-MMA combat style, you have to get amped. The trailer also showed Michael Douglas so you felt that the good acting was going to be handled by an able veteran. Add Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas and you have a can't-miss bundle. Well it has just arrived on rental and DVD so now I'm getting my chance to see Gina in action.<br /><br />Plot Ploddings<br /><br />At about the 36 minute mark I realized I had no idea what was going on, why and who any of the characters were. I had to check myself to see if I had checked out and stopped paying attention and missed some clues. No, it's one of those movies where they leave it blurry and bring it into focus at the very end, which doesn't quite make sense since the overall plot is as simple as it seemed in the trailer: super agent is double-crossed and sets out on a mission to find out why and at the same time - seek revenge. It doesn't work to keep us in the dark about something we already knew walking in.<br /><br />Cut to the chase<br />Let's get to the action and choreography since that's supposed to be the meat of this flick.  In true fanboy service, you will get to see Gina Carano as freelance agent Mallory Kane pull off several bread and butter MMA moves- including the triangle, Muay Thai leg kicks and the superman punch. The only problem is; all the best moments are pretty much shown in the trailers. The early scenes are well edited and frenetic enough to warrant the name haywire, but later they begin to feel like set ups. It's as if the director looked at the clock and figured it was time for a mini-fight scene and placed the characters in, oh just enough peril to have a quick fight. By the time the climatic confrontation (Which you won't know is going down until the credits roll) occurs you'll be hoping you can see something different. Unfortunately the action plays out the same as the first fight and only the quick jump-cuts make the fight seem any different.<br /><br />Sometimes it feels like I've slipped from watching an action movie to watching an action reel meant to prove Gina Carano is a great action-hero fit. We have long shots of her running (for almost no damn reason), which proves she can run and look cool [like James Bond] and we have her in several outfits showing off her curves. She is also allowed to play it sexy, aloof and cool in a few quiet moments. Her action-acting resume is accepted. In much the same style as Hanna (2011 main: Saoirse Ronan) there are several scenes set to music as if we are watching a music video. And that's another bothersome point. It feels as if director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Traffic, Erin Brockovich and Solaris +) was more concerned with getting a cool shot and placing the camera in an interesting place than following any kind of logical course of action for our heroine to take. To his credit, he may be a saving factor because removing those cool camera angles might have left some scenes looking very boring and plain. I mean, she's jumping over roof tops, but with no real sense of danger and no discernable reason to be doing so. She's not exactly trapped and the pursuing baddies aren't even sure where she is. So what's she doing besides looking awesome?<br /><br />In the end, I feel the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. You have many underutilized, bankable actors, a great physical actress and a plot as simple as it gets. Sure there are scenes with creative camera work. Sure there are moments when MMA-lovers can cheer at the screen and call out the techniques being used, but overall this movie represents a first step in what I hope is the budding film career of Gina Carano. I can easily see her as a Bond villainess or arch nemesis in the next Charlie's Angels. Although our heroine says early in the film that she doesn't like loose ends, this movie leaves us with a lot of loose ends. Hopefully, action superstar Gina Carano gets a chance to tie them up in her next movie role. Worth renting, not owning.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is very imaginative, being a story woven around odd, vintage photos. It took quite a bit of imagination to find a way to connect some very odd photos. It's obvious the author loves the photos and is trying to preserve them in this way. The atmosphere of the book is appropriately spooky and pulls you in. The book starts out with a heavy dose of teenage attitude but after the main character Jacob is on the hunt to understand his grandfather's odd last words, his voice does change. He is no longer a complaining teenager but one who is thoroughly engrossed in discovering a new world. Some reviewers were bothered by this change in voice but it makes sense in the context of the book. Even the most annoyed teenager can become pleasant when they are finally interested in something. Another frequent complaint is that the story seems like a weak excuse to pull the photos into the story, and though the mentions of some of the photos are a little choppy, I didn't find that the story was an excuse to showcase the photos.<br /><br />One reason that I held off on reading this book until it was recommended to me was that I was afraid the story would be more geared to children because of the word children in the title, but this is a young adult book that I think can also appeal to adults and older children. It's not in any way childish and the imaginative story and spookiness draw anyone in. My only complaint is the ending as it was completely open ended for a stand along book. I don't know if it was the intention to allow for the possibility of a sequel should the book do well, but a sequel would be possible based on this ending.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These books were interesting in the sense that conversation is very very little in this book. That's the main gripe I have with it. The story is amazing, especially the first of the series. But it's almost completely narration and almost no conversation at all. The conversations that are in the story are short and boring. Great story, though, and a great insight into the cruelty that the author sees if some people have too much political power.

B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Let's be honest. \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" should have never been a hit. The fact that it has become one feels as natural as Bobby McFerrin's 1988 hit \\"Don't Worry Be Happy\\". \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" is stripped down in an age of overstuffed pop fluff manufactured for the masses. It is almost acapella in quality. As minimalist as a Sting or Police song like \\"Walking On The Moon\\" or \\"Love Is The Seventh Wave\\". And if you were expecting the rest of the album to be this way you would be sorely disappointed. \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" is the only song that is like that on \\"Making Mirrors\\", Gotye's third album.<br /><br />I admit that I came upon Gotye much like most people have, by hearing \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", but then he wasn't given much exposure in the United States prior to this. A Belgian by way of Australia, the near 32 year old Wally De Backer is like Prince or Terence Trent D'Arby in the sense that he makes all his music. He has been compared to Sting \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" and Peter Gabriel \\"Bronte\\", but it is undeniable that he sounds like Steve Winwood at times \\"I Feel Better\\".<br /><br />\\"Making Mirrors\\" is more diverse than his 2008 sophomore album \\"Like Drawing Blood\\". Gone is the reggae dubstep from that album (with the exception of \\"State Of The Art\\" and \\"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You\\"--two tracks that once again explore the themes of modern living, just as 2008's \\"Thank You For Your Time\\" did.<br /><br />Despite all of these good elements, Gotye comes off as derivative more than original. Don't get me wrong, the album is good, but it just misses that extra something that would have made it classic. I think Gotye is still finding his musical way. I think he is still developing his sound. What this means is that in the future he could potential make a great album.<br /><br />I've been listening to pop music for far too long to be suckered by \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\". Although I like the song and think it is unique in contrast to what else is out there right now, I am not naive enough, or young enough, to forget all the pop music that is similar that has come before Gotye. Make no mistake--he is borrowing heavily from artists that came before him. You will know that he has arrived musically when it will be difficult to compare him to others and difficult to directly link his music to the past.<br /><br />The best tracks here are \\"Easy Way Out\\", \\"Eyes Wide Open\\", \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\", \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\", \\"I Feel Better\\", \\"In Your Light\\", \\"Giving Me A Chance\\" and \\"Bronte\\". The weakest tracks are easily \\"State Of The Art\\" with the ridiculous use of a voice modulator to hammer the point across that Gotye is not really enjoying modern music making technology. I found this track to be quite irritating. Also, \\"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You\\" is rather dull and lifeless. \\"Save Me\\" is mediocre. The opening track \\"Making Mirrors\\" is just a segue really, and I don't count it as a musical track.<br /><br />So, overall, four stars because it is enjoyable and memorable, but ultimately derivative and lacking that final element that would have made it a classic five star album. For those of you too young to know, if you have to ask what would qualify as a five star classic album that influenced \\"Making Mirrors\\", well, here you go:<br /><br />The Beach Boys: Pet Sounds (1966) and Smiley Smile (1967)<br />Fleetwood Mac: Rumours (1977) and Tango In The Night (1987)<br />Talking Heads: Remain In Light (1980)<br />Laurie Anderson: Big Science (1982)<br />The Police: Synchronicity (1983)<br />Peter Gabriel: So (1986)<br />Paul Simon: Graceland (1986)<br />Steve Winwood: Back In The High Life (1986)<br /><br />As for Gotye, here is how \\"Making Mirrors\\" compares to his previous works:<br /><br />2003 Boardface: (Unfortunately Amazon does not have this album to download, so I have not heard it)<br />2008 Like Drawing Blood: Three Stars<br />2012 Making Mirrors: Four Starsque in contrast to what else is out there right now, I am not naive enough, or young enough, to forget all the pop music that is similar that has come before Gotye.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|Oprah?  Really? This is an insult! The only redemption for this version is to choose audio 2 -no narration.<br /><br />I was so excited when I first inserted the first Blu-Ray disc. The majesty of nature in full High-Definition in my living room. It was magnificent in it's full 1080p glory, until the narration commenced. It sounded like Oprah so I looked at the case and indeed it was her. I said to myself maybe she'll be good at it since she did have a very successful talk show where all she did was talk. Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no. She should have kept her day job. It's ruined. I wouldn't dare donate it to Goodwill and make someone experience the same deceptive expectation.<br /><br />I hate it so much that I made this emphatic and overly dramatic review for the very first time, in hopes to nudge would-be expecting consumers.<br /><br />I just have to suffer the consequences of my poor deceived decision.

I have no (new)romantic delusions about that decade and my identity is not invested in the music of that era. Yet This Cd is like a British 80's band's entire greatest hits compilation (only better) all in one shiny pop debut. It's always rare when an album of songs are this good from beggining to end. By good I mean catchy, I mean listen to over & over, I mean grown man boppin around like a f....n school girl.

B001DHXT2A|4.0|Back in 2003 we the Fanboys were given 'The Hulk', directed by Ang Lee and staring Eric Bana as Bruce Banner.  While the fight scenes were pretty epic at times, this film utterly failed, namely by ignoring the source material.  I plan on doing a review of 'The Hulk' here shortly...<br /><br />So, since the first 'Hulk' was not loved by the fans, and also to get a prequel in that would conincide with the 'Avengers' release, Marvel went back to the drawing board.  It was a good decision.  One, 'The Hulk' came out 9 years ago, so a more updated prequel/film was needed.  Two, a better back story needed told.  They achieved this.<br /><br />--Story/Premise--  **(Spoilers ahead)**<br /><br />The movie begins with us the viewer seeing Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) living down in South American and trying to get by, working in a soda factory.  He is also trying desperately to contain the monster within him and find a cure.  He is currently in correspondence with another scientist back in the states.<br /><br />Enter General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross (William Hurt), father of Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), a military man on the hunt for Bruce, aka The Hulk.<br /><br />The film gives a decent but simple backstory for the Hulk's birth.  Dr. Banner was developing a serum that would make people immune to gamma radiation.  I guess his goal was to make people immune and take away the threat of nuclear attacks.  People with this immunity to radiation could work in nuclear facilities without fear.  Cancer could be abolished as well.<br /><br />Well he tries the formula on himself and bombards himself with gamma radiation, in a machine strait from the Bill Bixby tv series.  Well...things don't go as planned, and the formula combined with the gamma beam transform him into the Hulk.  He injures Betty and General Ross and completely destroys the lab.<br /><br />Shortly afterward he flees and has been on the run from the U.S. Government ever since.  This is a very similar premise and tone to the much loved television series from the 1980s, another reason this film was good.<br /><br />FYI, it turns out the base material for the serum he was working on was similar to the super-soldier serum that infused Captain America with his strength.  A cool unifying point here.  If you watch Captain America, after the scientist who developed the serum is killed, blood samples are drawn from Steve Rogers in hopes that it can be someday be duplicated again.  This imperfect serum is what is used in the 'Incredible Hulk'.  I also will take a guess that Nick Fury has taken a form of it, and is quite older than he appears.  Time will tell if my theory is right...<br /><br />Needless to say General Ross wants the Hulk back and to discover how he has so much strength and power.  Thus the chase is on.  Enter Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), a transferred soldier from Britain brought in to join Ross's black ops team.  Their goal is to get Banner, alive.  After a slip up by Bruce, they determine he is in South America and attempt to capture him with force.<br /><br />This fails of course, Banner transforms after months of successful calmness and gets away.<br /><br />Jumping ahead, Ross has the bright idea to try a version of the super-soldier serum he has been working on, on Blonsky.  It works, Blonsky is infused with energy, strength and goes up against a transformed Banner.  He however loses, and the Hulk kicks him HARD, smashing him against a tree and leaving him more broke than Evel Knievel.<br /><br />The Hulk escapes with Betty Ross and manages to make it to his mystery scientist, which he has been communicating with, Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson).<br /><br />Meanwhile Blonsky to the surprise of his doctors, fully heals from his injuries, thanks to the super-soldier serum, and is ready again for action.  Ross, thinking a little does good so a lot must do better, has even more of the serum injected in Blonsky.  This seems to have psychological influences on him and starts to cause monstrous qualities in him, just look at his back...<br /><br />Banner and Dr. Stern trigger a Hulk transformation and Stern infuses the Hulk with a purple formula derived from a plant.  This ceases the transformation and causes Banner to return, seamingly cured.  To Bruce's horror he soon discovers that Dr. Sterns has cloned his blood and has quite a stockpile of it.  Before he can do anything about it though, he is tranked by Ross's black ops team and apprehended.<br /><br />But...things are not over.  Blonsky want's MORE power and forces Sterns to infuse him with the Hulk's blood, transforming him into the Abomination.  He then starts to wreck havock on the city and calls out the Hulk to fight him.  Banner, not sure if he will still transform, jumps out of the helicopter and hurtles to the ground below.  It seems he isn't going to transform and slams into the pavement, but...he transforms at the last minute.<br /><br />An epic battle ensues between the two monsters.  Fans of the 'Hulk' video games will like the part where the Hulk weaponizes himself by smashing a police car and uses it's two halves as iron gloves.  Awesome fight scene, with the Hulk finally uttering his famous line \\"Hulk Smash!!!\\"  The film ends with the Hulk getting away and the Abomination smashed up pretty good.  The movie closes with us the viewer seeing Dr. Banner trying desperately to keep the Hulk inside with meditation, but eventually failing.  The film concludes with Banner smiling, his eyes turning green...<br /><br />--Possible 'Thor' Easter Egg--<br /><br />FYI, there is supposed to be a scene that ties 'Thor' to this film.  Apparently there are posts going around stating that during the end movie fight, if you watch the horizon you'll seen a random bolt of lightning.  This lightning strike is said to be the part where Thor is banished to Earth by Odin.  I can't confirm this, in fact I don't recall seeing anything of the sort when I have watched the movie.  I can only suggest you watch it for yourself.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Thought this was worth mentioning.<br /><br />--After Credits Clip--<br /><br />We find General Ross in an army bar getting plastered.  Who walks in?  None other than Tony Stark himself.  There is a brief banter between the two, then Tony mentions that \\"they\\" are putting a team together and he wants Ross in on it.  I guess this means that the Avengers want the Hulk.  Kind of an obscure scene.  Still, it shows that the 'Avengers' has been a project years in the making and in development since 'Iron-Man' came out.  Well, the wait is over...<br /><br />--Casting Choices--<br /><br />Edward as Bruce Banner was a pretty good decision.  Norton definitely has the chops for acting and rarely disappoints.  I am not sure if he was the PERFECT choice, and evidently wasn't as he was canned.  Mark Ruffalo has just signed a 6 film 'Hulk' deal, so maybe he is much better.  I'll soon see.  Overall Norton gives a good performance.  However he has nothing to do with the Hulk.  Once the CG transformation is over, Norton went to his trailer.  The Hulk was actually voiced by Lou Ferrigno, who did a good job.  Norton however in my opinion is probably better left to projects like 'Fight Club' and 'Primal Fear'.<br /><br />Liv Tyler as Betty Ross?  Not good at all.  She is in my humble opinion not the best actress.  Although she did alright in 'Lord of the Rings'.  This film however, they should have gone with Olivia Wilde.  Big fan of hers.<br /><br />William Hurt as General Ross?  Hurt wasn't the worse casting decision, BUT I still prefer Sam Elliot as Ross.  Hurt, while good in films like 'Michael' felt out of place slightly in this film.  Still they could have done worse.<br /><br />Tim Roth was a good decision at Emil Blonsky/Abomination.  Roth is good in just about anything and can go from dramas to action flicks at the drop of a hat.  I hope we see his Abomination's return in the future.<br /><br />--Home Releases--<br /><br />The Hulk was released on DVD and Blu-Ray.  I personally own the 3-Disc edition.  FYI, this \\"3-Disc\\" is just the 2-disc edition with a digital copy of the film thrown in.  It's not even in the jacket itself.  If comes in a paper sleeve, and will never fit in the case again after you remove it.  I never installed the digital copy, and actually think the time limits for installation have expired.  I could be wrong...  The biggest plus to buying the Blu-Ray or 2 or 3-Disc DVD are the numerous special features you get.  If you love special features, get at least the 2-disc edition, as the 1-disc is kind of lacking on features.  Or better yet, buy the Blu-Ray edition, it's pretty cheap now.<br /><br />--In Conclusion--<br /><br />This is the film we the fans wanted back in 2003 and failed to get.  Thank you Marvel for redoing this film AND doing it correct this time.  Some nice winks in this film at 'Iron-Man' and possibly 'Thor', and yet another hint at the 'Avengers'.  Good stand alone film and prequel to quite possibly the biggest release this summer, the 'Avengers'.<br /><br />Well, that's my thoughts.  I'll let you know how the 'Avengers' is soon...<br /><br />--References--<br /><br />1. 'Incredible Hulk' (Film).<br />2.

B003UESJH4|5.0|This was such an informative movie and so entertaining. The acting was wonderful as noted by all the awards it won last year. Makes you realize that even the great of this world have problems that need to be solved.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a very fun game to play.  I would like to see more games like this.  Thank you very much.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|WONDERFUL and heart warming story that just stays on your mind and in your heart for the longest. The cinematography was beautiful, especially the last few scenes. The time just slipped away so rapidly. I'll never understand how they got the horses to do all the amazing things they did in this movie.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|last update deleted my save data. great game, but now ill be starting again at the beginning. had 5 stars on most levels.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Few of us probably spend any time thinking about how life must be for those living in North Korea. This book sheds light on a country and a way of life that none of us can imagine. The stories of some of those North Koreans who survived and escaped the hell hole of a brutal totalitarian regime are mesmerizing. Please read to understand what is happening in a place no one should be forced to live.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Going back to my recent comparison of true crime vs. fiction crime, the same can be said for most any horrors humans have experienced.  With the hype of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" with \\"Escape from Camp 14\\" the readers are jerked back into reality into the sobering, sickening events that occur in today's world.  There is really no comparision.<br /><br />The author did an excellent job in pointing out how this man's story about his life since birth in a North Korean camp can be scrutinized; this man changed his story several times.  Skeptics can say he's lying.  He was raised in an environment to trust no one, no even his own family.  We readers (vast majority of us) have not visited North Korea, and I haven't seen field reporters on location in that country, and their closed society is well known.  While none of us were there, it's up to us whether or not to believe this story.  I believe the author carefully sifted through the details until we as the audience has as much truth as we can handle.<br /><br />The first half of the book is the back details the background of North Korea and the man's life in the camp.  The second half is about his escape and his difficult assimilation into Western society.  The story is harrowing, disturbing, tragic, but for this man, heartwarming.  He did make it out and shared with the world what an entire nation will not.<br /><br />This book is superb, not for the faint of heart, but highly recommended for anyone that understands true events hit our hearts in a way fiction never can.  Five stars!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|it is really fun but the one thing I do not like is what you pay!it is a rip of.they should lower there prices
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|** SPOILER ALERT **<br /><br />The Avengers movie is a great action adventure movie with a very strong cast of characters that includes Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth),  Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson).  The movie has a faster pace than the previous movies that defined the main characters.  If one word could define the movie it's crisis management.  Bringing the heroes together is Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D - a counter-terrorist agency trying to stop the alien invasion.  On the other side is Loki (Thor's brother) and the mysterious alien race that he has made a deal with to invade Earth and make himself its ruler.<br /><br />This movie is a non-stop chase and attack scene where the Avengers must first come together and put aside their differences to work together against a common villain.  When S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Iron Man and Captain America capture Loki, they must fight Thor who is on a mission to bring him back to Asgard to face his father Odin.  The alien invasion battle over New York City must be seen to be believed - it's a feast of special effects and destruction that's really spectacular.<br /><br />Overall I rate this movie 4 stars since I feel that the story could have been stronger, but the movie is still well worth the money to see.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Had heard about this book but thought no it's not my type of book!  Icouldn't put it down I'm so glad to have discovered this author.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great way to explore the Bible. There is a plan for everyone. Highly recommend this App to everyone.  I love the daily reminders.
B0074JODP8|4.0|It's fairly unbelieveable that there are 28 five star reviews as of writing this.  Obviously there are a LOT of die hard Bonaholics who are writing these reviews (which is great).  The only reason I lowered my rating to four stars, is that in comparing this to his Royal Albert Hall DVD, it diminished the importance.  Here are some pros and cons;<br /><br />Pros;<br /><br />The Gary Moore cover was a great choice, especially at the time of it's recording.<br />The new drummer is great, and maybe a little better than the former one.<br />\\"If Heartaches Were Nickels\\" was finally performed on a DVD.<br />The special guests are amazing, especially John Hiatt.<br />The snippet about Joe playing in the subway was great.<br /><br />Cons;<br /><br />Not that I don't like the songs, but why put \\"Mountain Time\\" AND \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" on ANOTHER DVD?  They are very long songs, and I really didn't think it was an asset to add the same 20 minutes of songs that we heard on the Royal Albert Hall DVD.<br /><br />The second DVD was really unnecessary, because if you eliminated the above mentioned songs, you could have surely added the bonus features to the first disc, and lowered the price of the DVD.<br /><br />The featurette with David Crosby was very boring, and no disrespect to Crosby, but Joe looks completely bored during the whole \\"interaction.\\"  It seemed to me like a situation in everyday life when you are talking to someone you are bored with, and just keep saying \\"yes\\" and \\"ok\\" in hopes that the conversation will soon end.  Does Crosby really think Joe needs hints on playing guitar?  I just didn't find this interesting at all.<br /><br />So for all the people who couldn't imagine that I gave this four stars, please calm down.  I liked this DVD a lot, and would tell anyone to buy it.  But, for those die hard fans who have everything Joe has released, I have already gotten tired of two DVDs with a few of the same songs on them.  Why does Joe always tend to skip material fromhis first few albums?  At least the BCC DVD \\"Live Over Europe\\" had a wide range of songs.
B000002LOE|5.0|I bought this from Amazon, It arrived in good time, it is of good quality, but by mistake I also bought 2 of these so had to return one, other than that everything was satisfactory
0385535139|5.0|Well it's about time!!  I've read every Grisham book and haven't been overjoyed with them for many years.  I consider this book to be \\"classic John Grisham\\" and I loved every single word of it!  I'll be anxiously waiting for the next one and hoping he has found his groove again permanently.
0765356139|5.0|Second in the Mistborn fantasy series revolving around Vin, a Mistborn, and the man she believes she loves, King Elend.<br /><br />My Take<br />I had a hard time getting back into this series, but once I was well, in the pace picked up and I had to find out if my questions would be answered. I so wanted Elend's ideas to triumph and Sanderson did beautifully with balancing desire and reality...even if I didn't like it. So true of the real world...wah.<br /><br />This story is one of growth for Elend and Vin. For Elend to own being a king and for Vin to realize her own value. Sazed's own certainties take a beating and he will have to determine his path alone, going from the detached scholar he was to a grim realization. It's of kindness and consideration as Vin finds out when her betrayer betrays his own to give her aid.<br /><br />Overall, this story is about Truth. Holding to it, to one's convictions no matter the situation, no matter the raging pull to Lie. Just this once.<br /><br />Vin also has a revelation about Kelsier and how she has focused on all the wrong things. It wasn't the hours he spent training Vin, his ability to fight, his harshness or brutality, his strength or his instincts, but his ability to trust. \\"...the way that he made good people into better people, the way he inspired them...[how] his crew worked because he had confidence in them--because he respected them. And, in return, they respected each other. Men...who became heroes because Kelsier had faith in them.\\"<br /><br />There is quite enough tension and drama as it is, however, I still feel Sanderson dropped the ball a bit by not exploiting the spy the crew knows is around them. Only Vin seems to be doing anything and even that is somewhat half-hearted. Then there's that loose thread of the poisoned water... I must have missed what happened with Lekal's family. Or Sanderson isn't keeping us in the know. I did enjoy the further analysis of the journal first mentioned in [[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, #1)]]; if only because it provided a bit more info on the Deepness.<br /><br />I just love when Elend tells Vin: \\"...he told me that he trusted my judgment. He'd support me if I chose to leave him.\\"<br />Followed by Vin's response to Zane: \\"Even if I can't share his ideals, I can respect them.\\"<br /><br />It's the first sentence of which anyone should take heed. For it is also the last.<br /><br />The Story<br />The vultures haven't given King Elend and his crew much time to consolidate their hold on the city of Luthadel. It's Elend's own father out there first before the city walls with 50,000 troops. And without the atium, Elend's new kingdom has no chance.<br />The complications continue to pile up as more armies appear. As the Assemblymen teeter on a precipice of fear and greed. It's a time of fear and indecision for all of them as each worries as to what Kelsier would say or do, what he would think.<br /><br />It's also a time of introspection for Elend, especially when Tindwyl shows up and schools him. For Vin, it's the appearance of another Mistborn and the doubts he plants within her mind.<br /><br />The Characters<br />King Elend Venture is struggling to incorporate the philosophies and theories he's spent most of his life absorbing with the political realities of governing the Central Dominance. Noorden is a scribe, one of the Obligators who chose to stay.<br /><br />Vin is Elend's assassin, bodyguard, love. She's also Mistborn. One of those rare humans who can burn all ten of the Allomantic metals. Even rarer, she is the strongest Mistborn known. Reen is the brother she thought had abandoned her. OreSeur is the kandra whose Contract Kelsier passed to Vin. Now he must do all he can to protect her.<br /><br />The rest of Kelsier's old crew includes \\"Ham\\" Hammond, a Thug, who is the captain of Elend's palace guard; Dockson who hates nobles but is brilliant at organization; \\"Clubs\\" Cladent, a Smoker, is Elend'sgeneral; \\"Spook\\" Lestibournes is a good Tineye, a scout, able to trace anyone's path and Clubs' nephew; and, Breeze, Lord Ladrian, a Soother, who is out somewhere in the countryside.<br /><br />Sazed is a Terrisman, a Keeper of knowledge. He's also gone against the Synod's orders. Tindwyl is a Terriswoman come to teach Elend how to be a king. She is also a Keeper and frustrated with Sazed. Marsh was Kelsier's brother. He agreed to infiltrate the Steel Inquisitors to spy for the crew (see [[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, #1)]]) and he became one. Now he has some hidden agenda. Captain Demoux, the second-in-command of the palace guard, has a split part to play.<br /><br />Straff Venture is Elend's father. A man I wouldn't hesitate to knife in a dark alley. The Watcher, Zane Venture, is another Mistborn. One with his own agenda. Amaranta is a discarded mistress of Straff's who still has her uses. A singular lesson in \\"a woman scorned\\". Lord Janarle is also Straff's general--and becoming more and more disillusioned with his \\"employer\\". Ashweather Cett brings up the second army and, in his way, is both more devious and more honest than Straff. Allrianne Cett is a puzzle. Devious, purposely captivating with her own Allomantic power. And I think, I think she's in love with Breeze... Gneorndin is Cett's protective son. It's an interesting relationship between the father and daughter...it'll be curious to see how it continues. TenSoon is another kandra.<br /><br />The Assembly is the democratic group of lords, merchants, and skaa gathered by Elend to advise and provide a brake on the ruler. It is critical to Elend that the people, all the people, have a say in their governance. Lord Ferson Penrod leads the lords with Lord Habren, Lord Dukaler, Lord Hue, among others. The merchants are dominated by Philen Frandeu, a man who thinks only with his wallet. The skaa include Getrue, Jasten, Thurts, Haws, and Vet.<br /><br />The koloss are another species of creature created by the Lord Ruler. Or, I should say monster...one that is learning. Jastes Lekal was one of Elend's friends back in the day. One with whom he had conspired towards a better Luthadel.

B001KZJQOU|5.0|Soft Cell had a gift for articulating the desires and frustrations of the working poor through theatrical songs that were delivered flawlessly by Marc Almond. His exceptional vocal range and abilities were beautifully offset by Dave Ball's imaginative and well engineered electronic instrumentation. This comprehensive collection assembles their best work as never before. Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is a true synth-pop masterpiece; embellished here by the two classic pre-LP singles - \\"A Man Could Get Lost\\" and \\"Memorabilia/Persuasion\\". Add an expanded version of the \\"Non-Stop Ecstatic Dancing\\" EP plus the 12\\" versions of \\"Bedsitter\\" and \\"Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go\\" and you have a collection that is essential to any modern music library.

Needless to say, it was a lovely trip down memory lane that has put some \\"pep\\" back in my step and some \\"creativity\\" back into my sexual innovations to accompany an awesome new sexual exploration opportunity.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|This product does not work as advertised. I put them on opposite ears and there was no difference.  I had these for 4 months and they work every other day.  On the days they<br />do work there is a horrible echo.  This is a waste of money Astros are better and last for 5 years not 4 months.
B000002KHB|5.0|As a teen in the 70's, i first came across this recording in its raw form on LP. Surprisingly, the band recorded it at all given the circumstances ( they recorded it in a blocked off hotel corridor with a mobile recording unit after the original venue burnt down- hence Smoke on the Water ) and this new version clarifies their sound from way back then, when parts of it sounded a bit muted and subdued.<br />Now, this latest recording separates out the different layers and the movement/ mix between speakers is great.<br /><br />Personally, I preferred In Rock as DP's best, rawest full-on rock, and Made In Japan for the spontaneity of a live recording, but Machine Head is a classic with hardly any weak spots.<br /><br />Purple is renowned as one of the founding bands of hard rock, along with Led Zep and Sabbath and this recording stacks up in all the right ways ! Btw, I still have the old LP ( 33 1/3 rpm ) and apart from scratches, it still sounds good. Rock on !
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Like most books of this genre, I hated having to put it down.  It's a fast, fun read.  But very early in I did have a few key plot points figured out ahead of time and was just reading to see if I were right.  I was.  Baldacci could have done a better job of \\"hiding in plain sight\\" these elements of the story in order to preserve the surprises that I'm sure he imagined for us but I doubt many will experience.  Too bad, because it was a good idea. Also, while his main character, Will Robie, is an admirable one, he is also too \\"close-cropped\\" for the reader to care much about him.  I imagine this is the challenge an author has in writing a character who does what Robie does for a living.  But I prefer my characters to have more humanity if I'm to believe they are real enough to relate to.  Robie's spartan approach to life gives the book's atmosphere a sterile feel, with the effect, on me at least, of dragging the plot rather than highlighting it.  Still, as near misses go, this was a good one that would make an excellent TV movie with Jason Statham!

B000P0J024|5.0|Thank you Rhino, THANK YOU! For far too long I have been looking for both albums by the Traveling Wilburys on CD but to no avail. I have the albums on cassette tape but they are getting old and worn. I loved the group and their music too much to lose it from my music collection. This two CD/ one DVD collection that Rhino has put together is great and fits the needs of any Wilbury fan out there. The three disc set include both albums, titled Volumn 1 and Volumn 3. The third disc is a DVD with the music video's they made as well as a documentary on the history of possibly the best \\"super\\" group ever in pop/rock. The sound quality for the two CD's I feel is very good. The music on both discs is outstanding and how could it not be? After all you have five of the best song writers together who are also five of the best musicians around as well. The second Wilbury album made didn't have Roy Orbison taking part in it because he died not too long after Volumn 1 by the Traveling Wilburys had been released. That Wilbury sound we know so well from their first album is lacking a little without the golden voice of Roy being part of it. It is still however just as strong and enjoyable to listen to as Volumn 1. The thing about this album that makes it so enjoyable to listen to is the pure joy and fun all the members of the group have as they were recording it. They got together not with the idea that they would make a record that would sell a ton of CDs and make them rich. All of them were already rich with well established careers. Plus with five of the biggest names in rock music joining together made it an automatic guarantee they were going to sell records. They just wanted to have fun and make some music together without care how much cash they made from it or winning any awards for their efforts. That is what makes both albums such fun to listen to. It is simply about the joy of music and having a good time. And it is very very hard not to have a good time when listening to the Traveling Wilburys. This set is a must have addition for any serious music lovers collection.the Traveling Wilburys. This set is a must have addition for any serious music lovers collection.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really, really did. The cast was great, the provenance hallowed...... but - the movie was alternately confusing, dull and baffling. The idea of presenting the life of Margaret Thatcher through the use of flashbacks from an old, and dementia afflicted Mrs. Thatcher must have been an exciting concept. However, the reality was confusing, boring and difficult to follow.<br /><br /> There is a far better version of the life of Margaret Thatcher, another unique approach to the life of Margaret Thatcher, but one that works: \\"The Rise and Fall of Margaret Thatcher\\". This is a sterling BBC production, using 3 actresses ( Andrea Riseborough, Patricia Hodge, Lindsay Duncan) to portray a very accurate representation of Mrs.Thatcher's life. I would highly recommend this 2 disc set to anyone wishing to learn more about Mrs. Thatcher and her times.<br /><br />Meryl Streep tried her best, all of the actors gave it their best, but -\\"The Iron Lady\\" just did not pull it off. The flashback sequences representing the life of an aged Mrs. Thatcher and a young Mrs. Thatcher, at the height of her power, just did not work. Denis Thatcher was presented as more of a clown and buffoon in his many appearances in the hallucinations of the old Mrs. Thatcher. I felt cheated by the lack of an accurate historical representation of the \\"Thatcher Era\\". The movie seemed to demean Mrs. Thatcher, love her or hate her... she was a very interesting politician. She served during some very historic times in Britain, none of that is accurately presented in this film. I am not and was not a fan of Mrs. Thatcher, but she was a very interesting person. This film does not reflect the complexities of the life of Mrs. Thatcher. Buy the BBC DVD set, you will be much better served by that version of the Thatcher years in the UK.<br />[[ASIN:B005K2T6FI Rise & Fall of Margaret Thatcher]]

B006RUJST6|4.0|A sensitive but not overly emotional portrayal of a woman with terminal cancer and her two children. The story centers around Layken an 18 year old woman who is coming to terms with the fact that her mother won't be around for much longer. She is grieving even though her mother hasn't yet passed away.<br />Through her friends, her younger brother and her teacher, she finds a measure of peace with what is happening to her family.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I am a fan of both David Baldacci and Lee Child and can say with certainty that, at least in my opinion, the comparisons of John Puller and Jack Reacher are without merit. Sure, there are parallels, but so what? Similar comparisons could easily be made of Paul Brenner, Nelson DeMille's Army CID protagonist from The General's Daughter.<br /><br />Baldacci is an excellent storyteller, and Zero Day doesn't disappoint. As with most of his thrillers, this one is both far-fetched and often ridiculous, but isn't the point of thrillers after all?
B004EPZ034|4.0|\\"Chipwrecked\\" is much the best of the three recent chipmunk movies.  It is imaginative, mischievous, well plotted, and thankfully devoid of so much of the \\"bad guy\\" emphasis in the other two.<br /> In this story, everyone (yes, even nasty Ian) must pull together for survival when they are stranded on an island. The scenes on the cruise boat are hilarious as Alvin wreaks havoc, Brittany emotes, and Theodore is adorably terrified watching a \\"scary\\" DVD -- don't worry, it doesn't even scare our just-three-year-old granddaughter, so no problem there, and it teaches the lesson that adults should pick the movies their kids watch.<br /> On the island all kinds of exciting and funny things happen. Simon becomes Rambo-esque \\"Seemone,\\" and the gang discovers a castaway. I am 69 and I love this movie, and so do my 3 -year- old granddaughter, my 10-year-old granddaughter, and my six-year-old grandson.  We laugh ourselves silly and we have seen it several times!<br /> Highly recommended for kids and for adults who are not afraid to laugh at something truly and innocently funny!

B003EYVXV4|5.0|this was the best movie I have ever seen in my lifetime. It's the best mix of romance and sy-fy. Jennifer Lawrence was great playing the role of Katniss Everdeen and hottie Josh Hutcherson was absolutely wonderful playing the role of Peeta Mellark! Did you know Lenny Kravitz, rockstar, plays Cinna, Katniss's stylist?I couldn't believe it. My favorite character was Peeta. Also, Elizabeth Banks plays Effie Trinket, the woman with the weird hair. Peeta's favorite color is orange, not pumpkin orange, but more like the sunset, more muted. And Katniss's favorite color is green. Jennifer Lawrence actually had to learn how to climb high in trees and she learned the sport archery. I'd have to say she was pretty good at it too. To me, this movie makes me think of what it will be like in the future, will it be like that or will it be fancier, like having a dress made out of recycled laptop parts or something. This is a must-see movie. BUT my least favorite part was when poor, innocent, sweet little Rue died. It was so sad. But otherwise, the movie was awesome! I'm just waiting for the DVD to come out.
0800141806|5.0|I will add more later, but suffice to say that this movie ranks among the best - right out there with \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".  Not to be missed.

B007P3TMW2|5.0|I thought that the book was really good. I had low expectations for the movie and was unsure that the movie could portray the book well. Fortunately, the movie surpassed all expectations I had. In fact, I would say that the movie was entirely better than the book. The screenwriters added some minor things to the plot that made the storyline less confusing, more interesting, and appealing to the audiences emotions. The last 30 minutes of the movie, when the audience learns the full plot of the movie, was wonderfully produced and provided even more emotion for the viewer. If you're looking for a great tear-jerker movie with a well-written, produced, and acted plot-line, this is your movie. Again, ABSOLUTELY brilliant.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a great game when your board!But the best part is that its free!Finally I found somthing that dosent need Wi-Fi.So buy it when you can.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|Definitely worth the time to watch this movie.  The first half hour I spent blushing at some of the scenes.  That being said this was a wonderful adaptation of the original book. Pattinson did a fantastic job on bringing forth the evil nature of Bel Ami and showing even he was prone to actually falling in love with Christia Ricci's character.  Loved the book and definitely loved seeing it brought to life in this movie.
1400069289|5.0|In the spirit of Malcolm Gladwell's books (i.e. Outliers, Blink, etc...), NY Times reporter Charles Duhigg has a written a very solid book on Habits (i.e. why we do what we do without thinking or struggle to change).  The meta point of this book is that Habits are ingrained in us and define every level of existence and social entity from individuals to corporations and government to society at large.  While I was initially skeptical at its aim, the book is incredibly readable and insightful, drawing on mountains of research (and data) from neuroscience, corporate marketing cases, government programs, and social movements.  Not only is The Power of Habits simply interesting (dare I say addictive), it points to actionable measures that all these different levels (i.e. individual, firm and society) can take to escape negative habit cycles and improve their lot.<br /><br />It's not often that I say this but \\"The Power of Habits\\" will find a durable place on my bookshelf for ongoing reference.  Great achievement and likely to become a classic for marketing and self-help genres.

1469984202|5.0|This book was GOOD.  I am not a clever reviewer, so look elsewhere for literary critique...  I read to be entertained intelligently- this book did that and then some.  I couldn't put it down.  The characters were the type that you invest in, the story had enough mystery to make it a page turner, there were just the right amount of details.  And of course, I love PAF.  And this is PAF done just right.  I can't wait to read more about the silos. Thanks to the author for writing outside the box, job well done.

I use to wear my hair tied back on a very tight ponytail and I was loosing hair so fast that I thought I was going to end up bald... but now my hair is full of life and incredibly soft...

0399159029|3.0|.....writing 'history'. Kerr has an encyclopedic mind per the Third Reich but I sense his next book will probably be the attempt on Hitler's life in Rastenberg. What a bore that will be. The author has lost his footing. The craft he showed in the past is fast disappearing. Thankfully there won't be Gunther just happening to 'pop up' on the 8th February 1942 as the news of Fritz Todt's passing is reported or will there?<br /><br />Kerr's problem is he can't craft another character than Gunther. He better quickly because sooner or later his boy Bernie's past 'recorded facts' will collide with his creator's new adventures.

0393088774|5.0|As a recently graduated economics minor in school, it was easy to understand this book and it presented a great set of logical conclusions about how to quickly bring the economy out of its current slump. Basically, according to Krugman, we need to do exactly the opposite of most of what we have been doing. The federal government needs to provide extensive stimulus to the economy to in a sense \\"jump-start\\" it. He talks often of the issues caused by the low interest rates that have sat at 0% for years and why they are turning conventional economic wisdom on its head.<br /><br />Overall a great read. Not sure it would be possible to convince someone from the increasingly-ideological Republican party to read it, but they all should!

0345803485|1.0|The main character, Ana, is a cliche. If she's supposed to be unworldly and virginal, how does she fall for this. How does she know what a 19th century roccoco style bed looks like, or that leather is the color of ox blood. Why isn't it just a four post bed or red leather.<br />For readers that dive into a detail rich well written story, this isn't for you. It's written in present tense, which pulls the reader out of the equation. She does this and then this and then this and then this. I've never read a book that was 100% telling and no showing - including not reading this one. Had to put it down unfinished.<br />Its sad because I really wanted to like it...

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle in 3 days.  Actually less than that but why argue over half days.  A warning about the content of this book: do NOT read just before eating, while eating or just after you have eaten... you might not like the results.  It has lots of amazing descriptions of Pi's life but they can be VERY detailed in ways that are tough to stomach.  Besides that small disclaimer it was one of the most incredible books I think that I have ever read.  The writing was superb, the tale unbelievable (be sure to read the author's forward... if you are reading it on Kindle you will have to \\"go to\\" the cover of the book and flip a few pages in to read this), and the characters so real they leap off the page/screen into my mind and I know they will remain there for many, many years to come.  Thank you, Yann Martel, for an exquisite story.<br /><br />I did not know what this book was about until I read a short description of the movie that is supposed to come out later in 2012.  I hope they don't make a horrible movie... but I will probably go see it regardless!  :)<br /><br />Read this if you are interested in religion, (although it is not fully about that) interested in animals, (but it is not fully about that either) or are interested in a really well written story.  Make sure you have a bit of time on your hands because you may not be able to put this down!!
0393088774|5.0|Dr. Krugman  not  only nails the central problem of the lingering depression we endure but also it's solution. In essence he shows that governments are not \\"just like families\\" who must balance a budget on a monthly basis and in an eminently readable style educates as he argues that austerity in the face of such a protracted downturn is counterproductive even if the only measure of success is debt (as opposed to short term deficit). But he does not only argue the cold calculus of dollars, and grounds his arguments in compassion for the tens of millions whose lives are potentially never to be on-course if this depression goes on indefinitely. Will inflation be controllable? Will tools such as devaluation in currencies mitigate the impact of strong pro-growth measures in the future?  I say probably, but admit as I suspect he would, that I could be wrong. Will government know when to lift the foot off the gas?  Probably but who can say for certain. But this much I do know: what has been done has not worked and what the opponents to this approach are advocating is much, much worse.    DFD  [...]

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Have also read his earlier 2 books and this one is terrific, and his best. It is a crime thriller and a character study of a family dealing with denial and secrets. Each parent deals differently with loyalty to their child and with accepting what is revealed about him.<br />The narrative reviews what happened in order and shares each fact with the reader. I found myself struggling with what to believe as the story is told. There is a very well done hint quite early in the book that there is some active subconsious knowledge about the central dilemna of Jacob's potential culpability. An action comes from one of the parent's subconcious, while the parent's conscious mind is sheathed in denial.<br />This struggle of what is in front of the parent, what he or she wants to believe, and how each sorts it out made me flash to times in my life where I both knew, and did not know, some painful fact.<br />There was a lot about the corrosive effects of secrets. The father believes that the path to his relationship with his wife was via hiding a toxic secret. We find out that wife protests that the damage was from its being a secret. We come to understand that the husband's judgment was correct, the fact itself was the throttler of the relationship. The wife is damaged by her friends withdrawing from her, during the time when she is withdrawing from her husband.<br />The crime thriller part was also very well done, with many clues that changed in significance as you learned more about their context.<br />Reommend it heartily.

0312641893|3.0|One Sentence Review: Cute but predictable.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Prince Kai: He wasn't your typical Prince Charming. There was real passion and depth to his character. I loved that he was so willing to sacrifice himself and his happiness for his country. He's way more than a pretty face and a title.<br /><br />The Setting: I love the sci-fi twist on the classic Cinderella tale. I also liked the addition of the Lunar People and the possability of a missing princess and royal intrigue. It takes this classic tale up a notch and makes it that much more fun to read.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />Cinder as a cyborg: I wasn't totally sure why that was chosen over some other kind of differential. Being a cyborg was just a vehicle for bigotry, but so was being Lunar - so I'm not sure what the point really was other than to make it a science-fiction book.<br /><br />It was super predictable: (spoiler alert) From the minute we heard the tale of the \\"missing\\" princess it was pretty obvious what/who Cinder was. But, it's Cinderella after all - it's not like we didn't know she was going to eventually become a princess in some fashion or another.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app for learning to play. Replay this hand-random or winng deal is nice so you can practice at different options. Hint button was great  for seeing optional plays. Ads start to pop up larger with more play. This was the free version-I plan to upgrade now that I know how to play. Wish there was a tutorial when I started to play. Did not understand how to play. Good application!

B004EPZ03O|5.0|I have always loved the Muppets, and watched their show when it was on the television.  It makes it a happy person when I watch them
B003O86FMW|3.0|I liked the book, but not as well as the first one. As with most sequels, it isn't as strong as the initial book. I felt like more could have been done to keep the reader's (my) interest. After reading the first book, the second was pretty predictable as far as characters and plot goes. This being said, I do intend to read the third book of the trilogy. Don't get me wrong! It was not Harry Potter, but I am glad I read it. My son enjoyed it as well.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I ordered this movie because I saw in the theater, and just loved it.  Watched<br />it again, and still loved it!  No problems with ordering and receiving it in<br />a timely manner.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Excellent storyline.  Just complex enough to remain interesting but not so complex that the reader becomes mired in details.  Great ending, superb character development as the story unfolds. I hope Baldacci continues exploring this genre.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I just finished reading this book, all in one morning.  I could not put it down.....it was captivating, thought provoking, heartbreaking and incredibly romantic. The characters got under my skin and I rooted for them again and again. The poetry was incredible, as well...showing that Ms. Hoover is a gifted poet as well as a talented novelist.  I hope this author continues to share her gift of writing with the world.  I have already purchased the second book and cannot wait to begin reading.
0061743526|5.0|I am 68 years old and I'm ashamed to admit that I've never read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD until now. I've read most of the great novelists (Dickens, Hemmingway, Maugham, Steinbeck, etc.) but TKAM just escaped me. For the record, this is one of the great novels of our time. It led directly to the civil rights movement and changed America forever. My advice: Don't wait until you are 68 to read it!  RMS
0545265355|5.0|Thank you for the speedy delivery.  The boxed set arrived in great condition and was the perfect gift for a friend.  I already had this book series downloaded and cannot wait to read it!

Dragged and i-stunt 2 rock also! All of them are must-have apps!
0385342063|3.0|Since the day I picked up Sophie Kinsella's Undomestic Goddess, I feel in love with her laugh-out-loud humor and went on to read all of her books (aside from the ones under her real name).  I was highly anticipating I've Got Your Number, but I have to say I am getting disappointed in her last few novels.  They are all fun, don't get me wrong, the plots are getting more and more intriguing, but the \\"romance\\" are all the same.  I must admit I am glad the \\"embarrassing\\" moments are getting mild, and I don't have to put down the book and bury my face in a pillow out of vicarious embarrassment for characters.  At times I also get mad at her characters for being utterly stupid.  The only time I winced was when Poppy (her name annoys me, for whatever reason, maybe because it's childish?) started sending out Sam's emails.  I just felt so sorry for Sam, if I was him, I would be furious.  Sam's character is also unpredictable, whenever he seems to be unable to tolerate Poppy's antics any longer...he still somehow sticks around to console her.  Perhaps I am just jealous of Poppy, she isn't a drop-dead beauty nor is she the sharpest tack in the drawer, but somehow she has dark, handsome men falling for her left and right.  I didn't care for all the \\"corporate\\" business since all that stuff sounded like some poor attempt at a climax or drama.  I wanted Poppy to learn how to be strong-willed and confident, but she never gets there (maybe there will be a sequel?).  There were other, deeper themes like the loss of parents, family that faded into oblivion.  One of my least favorite Kinsella novels, but still very easy to read and addicting in the best possible way.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very fun game man I mean its cool
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I bought this not expecting very much. I just needed a tripod and holder for my time lapse vids. I got exactly what I ordered. Yes, it's plastic. Yes, it's not professional grade. But c'mon! it was only a $1.24 when I bought it. I am very pleased with this product as it does exactly what it says. It will not fit the bigger phones. It wont even fit the iPhone with a case on it. The only negative I have found is that it needs rubber feet. If it had rubber feet I would have given it 5 stars. Thanks for a very good inexpensive product. If something should happen to mine, I will get another.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|wow ive been waiting so long. ive been playing the external app so long. FINALLY!! BEST FREAKIN APP EVER. REALLY ADDICTIVE!
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese's documentary on the late Beatle George Harrison, GEORGE HARRISON: LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, named after [[ASIN:B000HIVQK8 the singer's 1973 album of the same name]], was released in the U.K. last fall on DVD and Blu-ray, and aired in the U.S. on HBO.  Finally, the U.S. DVD/Blu-ray is out, and it is well worth the wait.<br /><br />The film airs in two parts:  Part 1 covers George's life from his Liverpool childhood through the height of Beatlemania and beyond.  Part 2 begins with the White Album-era tensions between The Beatles, and the group's eventual split, then focuses on George's solo career and his personal life.  There is one significant gap:  the documentary seems to skip from his 1974 U.S. tour (essential unseen footage here) to the Traveling Wilburys era, and leaves out his Dark Horse Records solo work from 1976-1992, including his 1987 comeback album [[ASIN:B00014TJ7K Cloud Nine]] and his 1991 tour of Japan with Eric Clapton.  [[ASIN:B0001ADB8C The Dark Horse Years 1976 - 1992]] box set does fill these gaps, as does a recently released iPad Multi-Touch e-book on iTunes.  The film's most glaring omission is during the segment on John Lennon's murder and its effect on George, which unfortunately does not mention Harrison's wonderful tribute song, \\"All Those Years Ago,\\" recorded with the other surviving Beatles, which was a #2 hit for George in 1981.<br /><br />The film does cover Harrison's career as a filmmaker with his company HandMade Films, including such hits as LIFE OF BRIAN and TIME BANDITS, with a brief mention of The Rutles thrown in for good measure, but wisely skips HandMade's Sean Penn/Madonna box office flop, SHANGHAI SURPRISE.  It also candidly deals with George's near-fatal 1999 stabbing and his ultimately losing battle with cancer.<br /><br />There's much archival footage of George throughout, much of it from [[ASIN:B00008GKEG The Beatles Anthology]], including some outtakes,  There are highlights of his musical career too, including the best-sounding versions of The Beatles' 1962 Hamburg Star-Club tapes that I have ever heard.  Whoever did the remastering on those songs should be hired by Apple for a proper rerelease of those tracks.  There are interviews with Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Sir George Martin, the late Neil Aspinall, George's lifelong friends Eric Clapton and Ravi Shankar, fellow Wilburys Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, his wife Olivia and son Dhani, race-car drivers Jackie Stewart and Gordon Murray (George loved Formula One racing, and even wrote a song about it (\\"Faster,\\" from 1979's [[ASIN:B00014TJ6Q George Harrison]] album)), and others.  Pattie Boyd Clapton, George's first wife, speaks candidly about their troubled marriage, and her affair with Eric Clapton, who she would subsequently marry and divorce.  Even convicted murderer \\"Crazy Phil\\" Spector gets into the mix, discussing the production of [[ASIN:B00005214X All Things Must Pass [BOXED EDITION]]] and [[ASIN:B000AYQJJ2 The Concert for Bangladesh (Limited Deluxe Edition)]] - the interview was probably done before his imprisonment.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a fine, loving tribute to George, just as the late David L. Wolper's [[ASIN:B000AYELY2 Imagine: John Lennon (Deluxe Edition)]] was for John.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition contains the film on two DVDs, and a single-disc Blu-ray.  Both have eleven bonus features,  including six (not specifically indicated on the packaging) that are not on the standard DVD or Blu-ray release.<br /><br />The four musical features are: 1) George playing his ukelele to (it sounds like) the old standard \\"A Shine on Your Shoes\\" (uncredited); 2) a soundcheck of the B-side \\"Deep Blue\\" from the Concert for Bangladesh; 3) a segment from Abbey Road Studios where George Martin and son Giles \\"break down\\" the master of \\"Here Comes The Sun,\\" much to the delight of Dhani Harrison; and 4) a Shankar Family and Friends instrumental called \\"Dispute and Violence,\\" recorded live during the 1974 U.S. tour.<br /><br />The seven interview segments include pieces on George's growing up in Liverpool, George describing the origins of the poem \\"The Inner Light,\\" which became the basis for his first Beatles B-side, and interviews with Paul McCartney, Neil Aspinall, Jeff Lynne, and race car drivers Gordon Murray and Damon Hill.<br /><br />The sort-of soundtrack CD, also available separately as [[ASIN:B007IE4DSG Early Takes Volume 1: Music From The Martin Scorsese Picture Living In The Material World]], consists of 10 Harrison demos and alternate takes, most, if not all, from the early-to-mid-1970s.<br /><br />The four discs are housed in a deluxe gatefold book with a Hamburg-era photo of George on the front cover, and a Linda McCartney photo of George (probably late '60s or early '70s) on the back cover.  There are also two stand-alone photos, one from Hamburg, and the other from the mid-'60s, with an easel included, as well as a soft-cover 96-page book, which is an abridged version of the hardback book [[ASIN:1419702203 George Harrison: Living in the Material World]]. Casual fans who already own the book and don't care about the DVD/Blu-ray extras may want to purchase the standard Blu-ray or DVD editions, and buy the EARLY TAKES CD separately.  But for fans who want it all in one felt swoop, this Deluxe Edition is essential.<br /><br />Happy 70th birthday, George, wherever you are.  I hope Olivia is planning a nice tribute (February 25, 2013).
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is what got me to pick up Austen's book in the first place.  Since then I have watched the BBC version a number of times and rewatched this version countless others.  I have come to the conclusion that a blend of the two would be perfect, but since that won't happen this is my first choice.  There is no correct or incorrect way to interpret literature so there can be no correct or incorrect way to produce a film based on Austen's book.<br />This version is my favorite because it was able to create a chemistry between the characters which, from my viewing, is completely missing in the BBC version.  Again, that was my interpretation of it.  Don't not view/buy this movie because reviews criticize its lack of authenticity.  If you want complete authenticity read the book.  If authenticity to the written word was required for every film Hollywood and every film producer would be out of business..
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun! Aside from the glitches...  as you read from other posts, it feeezes sometimes -  it got to the point where I was unable to select &quot;play game&quot; option.  after not playing for a while it just reset itself - kinda disappointing since I got really far,but happy to have the game back.  Hope they work out the glitches, but in the meantime I'll continue to enjoy the free version.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|the only bad thing about this game is that you need energy to do everything and you only have a little bit. it takes a long time to recharge your energy... or real money.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote installed on my Pc, my laptop, and my Kindle Fire. I use it for so many things, from organizing story notes and rough drafts, to formulating business ideas and budgets. As a slight scatter brain and not the most inherently organized person, it is wonderful to have all my notes sorted and categorized, right at my fingertips where ever I am.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This was one of the best movies of 2011 and one of the best acted.  I even bought one as a gift for someone who loved it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote in general is AWESOME!  I use it to keep information from the web as well as a Diary,  &amp; pictures &amp; recipe's,  whatever you want to keep, no more piece of paper everywhere and it is sooo easy to find what you need quickly. You can have it as organised as you want.
0439023513|1.0|I truly depressing ending to a wonderful series. There is no happiness at all in this book. Everone cool dies.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Read this about 3 books and 3 months after Pharr Davis' \\"Becoming Odyssa\\" as I've been addicted to long hike books lately.  While I identified more with Jennifer's life story,  \\"wild\\" will probably appeal to a broader audience with her story of using her travels to dig herself out of self destructive behavior.  I was rooting all the way for the author, and couldn't put it down once I got halfway through.
B0071MV540|5.0|i cant believe this movie only got an average of 3 stars....OMG i thought it was so funny........i couldnt stop laughing.........plus i love ben stiller...anything hes in i think is a riot !!!  if u want a laugh watch this movie....its crazy funny :):)
0679731725|5.0|Mr Stevens, a devoted manservant for nearly all his life to Lord Darlington,has deep seated memories and hopes rekindled by a letter from Darlington Hall's former housekeeper, Miss Kenton. He plans a road trip to visit her, hoping she may return to Darlington Hall. Throughout he is haunted by the past, both his own self denial in order to serve,his masters fall from grace and what might have been. But clocks cannot be turned back....<br /> Easily one of the best ever Booker prize winners, a haunting tale of class, manners and the course our lives take weaved in with the volatile political situation of the 20's and 30's gives this book a place amongst the immortal classics that will be read by generation after generation; something very few books achieve.The film adaptation of this book is superlative and it doesn't hinder your reading or enjoyment forever picturing Anthony Hopkins or Emma Thompson as Mr Stevens and Miss Kenton-whose first names we never learn. Truly great.
1401937268|4.0|I was so thrilled when these cards came in.  I love the fact there are no frightening or negative images in the deck, as there are in traditional tarot decks.  However, the messages are clear and accurate.  The big downside and why I gave them only 4 stars:  They are way too thick and big, making it difficult to shuffle and handle. I cannot get my hand around the entire deck, when shuffling and they just fly all over the place.  Very clumsy handling. I DO have small hands (size 5 1/2 to 6 ring), but regular sized card decks are not a problem.<br /><br />The entire deck of cards measures 5 inches tall x 3.5 inches wide, by 1.5 inches thick when all are stacked on top of each other.  A regular tarot deck which is MUCH easier size to handle, measures: 4.5 inches long x 2.5 inches wide by 1 inch thick.  What seems to be a slight difference in measurement, really makes a huge difference.<br /><br />If you have man sized hands, then this deck is for you.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the Oregon settler game! I like games like this so I defenitly love this!What I don't like about it though is the energy stuff.I just want to do stuff with out the energy running out.
0345803485|1.0|This is yet another book that has a popularity that boggles my mind.  It seems that some of these mediocre (and in this case depraved) books take on a life of their own and people just feel compelled to read them no matter how bad they are.<br /><br />Aside from the lousy sex these books parallel almost exactly Meyer's REALLY bad Twilight series and The Host.  Poorly written, poorly pace, over indulgent...and of course written by a woman that has some agenda behind her lousy fiction.<br /><br />American will gobble up anything if someone labels it \\"popular\\" enough.
B0018OAOQC|2.0|Wow, what a general consensus 5 star disappointment! What do people hear in this band that I don't? There is no Rockabilly fusion on this disc. What the heck are people talking about? The Stray Cats play contemporary definitive Rockabilly. This however is possibly Thrashabilly? Or, Tinfoil Alternamercial perhaps? Maybe there is another Volbeat disc where they actually fuse Rockabilly and Metal, but NOT on this one. The vocalist sounds JUST LIKE a typical Euro Knuckelhack clone. How refreshing, NOT! I don't care for the real deal, let alone bands that just serve to remind me of them. This is NOT \\"Hard Rock\\" any more than AC/DC is Heavy Metal. To call this band Hard Rock, or Heavy Metal either one, is like calling tea, coffee. No way! Far too commercial and fashionable in the wannabe dept. Where's the REAL beef here boys? I can hear 'em now...\\"but, were all vegetarians man\\". Tight, clean n shiny, and ultimately, BORING. Just more of the same ol' same ol' symptomatic ear pain that is the commercial radio disease called PopMental Tinfoil Rock.
0399226907|5.0|This is the quintessential Eric Carle book.  The illustrations are lovely, the story simple but engaging, and a \\"surprise\\" at the end.  My children and I loved this little board book and read it over and over.  It is on my list of books to make sure I have for my grandkids (many years down the road).  I also recommend Brown Bear, Brown Bear and Polar Bear, Polar Bear, although you almost can't go wrong with a Carle book for kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really wasn't sure what to expect when I heard about this book and then ordered.  My first inclination was it was all about the sex but as I kept on reading I got into the story and wanted to see where it would lead.  The second book is better and the third book is great!!!  Loved them all!!!
0399231919|5.0|Little Cloud has been following us around for many years now.  I first read this to my children when they were two and they loved the story and all the things Little Cloud turns into.  But over the years, it evolved into finding Little Cloud whenever we were out driving, at the park or in the yard.  It really sparked their imaginations and they started to make up new, fanciful stories about Little Cloud and it even helped during a short \\"fear of storms\\" phase when it was remembered that it was just Little Cloud up there and there was nothing to be afraid of.  We have really loved the Eric Carle books over the years and this is certainly no exception!
B007REAIUE|5.0|I was listening to XRT ((chicago) and the DJ hyped the heck out of North Side Girl before they played it and I was ready to be disappointed.  I wasn't,it was and is awesome.  I have played it for 3 different generations of people and everyone has loved it.  North Side girl is my five year old son's new favorite song.  I bought they album and it is one of the most solid albums I have bought in a long time.  Buy it, treasure it and play it for anyone who likes music.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this a fun little game to pass the time. if u enjoyed ice age with your kids u will love this and so will they. it worried great on my kjnddle fire.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|When i received the heat sink it looked quite complicated to put in, but the instructions are very helpful. It comes with WAY enough thermal paste to get the job done and man, once it was in and I booted up Skyrim, i was looking at upwards of 20 degrees Celsius cooler than before. I would recommend this for anyone who games on their PC alot. Excellent product for the price, in fact i would put it a step up from the 50+ dollar heat sinks on the market.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game (1977) is the first SF novel in the Ender-verse series.  It is set a century or more from the present in a world beset by alien invaders called Buggers from their ant-like appearance and behavior.<br /><br />Humans have repelled two invasions and now have organized the world under the Hegemony.  They have moved their military training into space.  After ground school, young children are taken to Battle School in orbit.  There they are organized into armies that fight with fake guns in the null-gee battle rooms.<br /><br />In this novel, Andrew Wiggin is the third child of John Paul and Theresa Wiggin.  His siblings are Peter and Valentine.  Ender was tested for Battle School and scored higher than anyone else at the time.<br /><br />Peter Wiggin is the oldest sibling.  He and Valentine were tested for Battle School, but were rejected.  The Peter and Valentine created the web identities of Locke and Demosthenes to influence public opinion.<br /><br />Hyram Graff is a Colonel in the International Fleet.  He is the head of Battle School and has the ultimate authority to decide whether to admit children to the school.<br /><br />Mazer Rackham had fought the Bugger through two wars.  He had won the second Bugger War.<br /><br />Petra Arkanian is an older student at Battle School.  She is as tough as the boys, but still has some compassion for the newbies.<br /><br />In this story, the monitor on Ender is removed.  Despite the monitor lady's declaration that it won't hurt, Ender feels intense pain and goes into convulsions.  A nurse injects a muscle relaxant into his back and gradually the convulsions stopped.<br /><br />The doctor orders the nurse to let him rest for at least an hour.  He is still a little unsteady after getting back to class.  The monitor is gone from his neck and his classmates notice its absence,<br /><br />Now that he isn't being monitored, Stilson and his friends wait for Ender after school.  Stilson pushes Ender and calls him names.  Some boys grab Ender, but he taunts them for having to gang up on such a small boy.<br /><br />When they let go of him, Ender kicks Stilson in the chest, knocking him down.  Ender considers what he can do to stop future fights.  He kicks Stilson several times and leaves him unconscious.<br /><br />When Ender reaches his home, Peter decides to play the Astronaut-Bugger game.  He knocks Ender down and kneels on him.  Ender cannot breathe and thinks that he is going to die.<br /><br />Valentine threatens to tell their parents.  Peter and Valentine trade threats, but Peter lets Ender get up.  Since she is the only one who protects him, Ender loves his sister very much.<br /><br />Then Colonel Graff comes for Ender.  Peter is angry and Valentine is sad, but Graff takes Ender off to Battle School.  They ride a shuttle into orbit.<br /><br />After they are in orbit, Graff isolates Ender from the other launchies, praising his answers and intellect.  One boy bashes Ender on the head several time while calling him names.  Ender grabs his arm and pulls him out of his seat and the boy is flung through the shuttle into the bulkhead.  Graff and other officers set his broken arm and inflate a cast around it.<br /><br />After reaching his barracks, Ender opens the locker door by putting his hand on the palm reader and saying his name twice.  Now the bunk is his until he is transferred.  Unfortunately, that bunk had been reserved for the group leader.<br /><br />Ender quickly learned that status in Battle School came from the games. The students were taught reading, numbers, and history.  Yet their scores in the battle rooms were more important.<br /><br />Ended watches recordings of prior encounters with the Buggers.  He views videos of the final battle of the second invasion when Mazer destroys a ship carrying the queen.  Apparently every Bugger stopped when the queen died.<br /><br />When Ender is assigned to an army, the commander tells him to stay out of the way.  Petra offers to help him learn to maneuver in null-gee and they have daily practices in the morning.  Ender improves rapidly and even learns some tactics from his commander's mistakes.<br /><br />This tale describes the trials of Ender at Battle School.  He soon notices that the teachers are the real enemies.  Graff is pushing Ender through the school and breaking traditions -- if not rules -- by doing so.<br /><br />He also had a few victories.  Naturally he wins battle games against other students, but his first victory against authority comes as he starts teaching other students during free practice times.  The army commanders try to get that stopped, but Graff allows Ender to continue.<br /><br />Ender is being groomed as the supreme commander of the battle fleets.  The next installment in this sequence is [[ASIN:0812550757 Speaker for the Dead]].<br /><br />Highly recommended for Card fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of war games, psychological manipulation, and quiet desperation.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin

B0055SWM08|5.0|Great graphics, music, and mazes. But... What's in the basement?! I am not a &quot;gamer&quot; on purpose because I have a bit of an addiction disorder down deep and don't want find myself playing games every waking moment, so, I am no pro, but this game is fun and beautiful.
B007QRWXJG|1.0|I used to really enjoy this show and looked forward to it each week.  It was well written and followed several different story lines that were meaningful or at least interesting.  Now, I feel like I'm watching mostly Don and his annoying love for that silly young wife with everyone else cast in a bit part.  I agree with the other reviewer that it's not about business anymore.  If they want to weave in the events of the time, it could still be done in a much better and more subtle way.  The show is now disjointed, BORING, and unconvincing.  I won't be watching it again.  I'm sticking with the HBO dramas.  At least they are well-written and I know when the show is about fantasy land!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|To me, what is important about a book is that it's like being able to eat Rocky Road ice cream in a bowl as big as your table without getting sick:  it lasts and lasts, every bite is good, and quite often you get a really good nut.  In \\"The Life of Pie\\" every so often you get a really good sentence you can chew on.  Do they make you believe in God?  They make you believe in writing.  In this book there are sentences bigger than Rocky Road nuts - they are boulders that come out of nowhere and make you hoot out loud.  I loved every drop of this book.  How could a young writer be so seasoned?  May he (please, God) remain so free!

B007V5CF5K|5.0|Fun, challenging, and the steampunk angle is just downright full of whimsy. My only problem is, I play on my phone, I can't zoom in on scenes so sometimes finding objects is VERY challenging.

B000JQUKKU|4.0|I've wanted to read this book for a while now, mainly to say I've read a Charles Dickens book and this one looked short. I did enjoy the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, it is a very famous and well known story, so i didn't really have to focus on what was happening and instead I focused on the beauty of the writing. I see why Dickens was so famous and I will be reading some more of his work in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|read it and grow spiritual. have you read your Bible yesterday for a better tomorrow?  don't put off today what you knew all your life.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|This truly is a classic tale of social insight, a story of one seeking acceptance and desiring companionship but being rejected and branded a monster. The thing that I liked most about this book is the fact that it's divided into two accounts, designed to view both sides of the story. The first part of the book `Frankenstein' tells the story of the life of Victor Frankenstein, the creation of Monster Frankenstein and the death of his younger brother William. A servant `Justine' has been put on trial for this murder, but Victor knows the identity of the true killer. Monster Frankenstein and Victor finally meet up and despite his desire to kill his creation, Victor is forced to listen to the monster's story, after being threatened.<br /><br />`The Modern Prometheus' tells the story of the Monster Frankenstein, confused and unsure from the very first day of life, found himself hiding in the woods watching people and learning how to find food, create a fire and how to differentiate between the feelings of happiness and sadness. Watching a family in poverty taught Monster Frankenstein many things and he started chopping wood and shoveling snow for the family while they slept. His loneliness finally drove him to show himself to this family who ended up running away in fear. With a mixture of loneliness and anger, he seeks out his creator, finding his way to William where he decides to kidnap him for companionship and ends up accidentally strangling him.<br /><br />This is where the two stories meet and monster Frankenstein pleads with Victor saying he's `a good creature turned bad by unforgiving humans who scoffed at friendship'. The monster pleads with Victor to make him a companion which he would take and never be heard from again. Victor reluctantly agrees but found it harder and harder to do, even though his family was in danger. Victor began to realize the female companion could wreck much havoc by giving birth to more monsters and refusing to be with the monster as a mate altogether.<br />Monster Frankenstein swears revenge and goes about killing everyone close to Victor in attempt to show Victor what it feels like to be alone. As Frankenstein dies, the monster appears in his room and begs his dead body for forgiveness.<br /><br />In the end the story has no true villain or hero. Monster Frankenstein and Victor Frankenstein were both portrayed as hero and villain. The story also leaves you wondering on how you treat others, do our actions end up turning people into a `monsters'? Overall this was a brilliant story, although the language was at times hard to understand, it is still worth the read.a mate altogether.<br />Monster Frankenstein swears revenge and goes about killing everyone close to Victor in attempt to show Victor what it feels like to be alone.

B000JQU4TW|3.0|I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.<br /><br />Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book.
0451213092|3.0|I came to be a Follett fan late, first reading Pillars of the Earth, but then devouring every book he wrote.  This book is NOT an example of his best writing.  While I can see why Perot contacted him to write the story, it doesn't feel like his heart was in it.  Don't buy it.  Get it from the library if you feel you must.  While I feel for the experience of those involved in the rescue, it does not make for interesting reading.
B0076NKNLA|3.0|i like this movie. excellence performance and great dialogs. again, technical issues that are becoming more frequent than never with the internet streaming. i had stopped to by the HD videos now because regardless there are going to be sudden stops during the movie. we manage to make it till the end, again good movie, it was worthy to work to fix the problem.
B001O37WTY|1.0|This movie is just plain awful.  I've heard all the arguments saying that it's and \\"adult fairy tale\\" or that I \\"just don't understand it,\\" but that's not true.  This movie sucks out loud.<br /><br />First, you have the main character putting on an erotic puppetshow on the street.  Then, he gets a job working on floor 7 1/2 of some office building.  Then he finds some weirdo tunnel that allows him to see through the eyes of John Malkovich.  If you can buy all of that, it gets worse.  Two other people learn about the tunnel.  John Cusack's character thinks that Cameron Diaz's character is spending too much time going into that tunnel (or some crap like that) and locks her in a dog kennel.  Then, the two women who know about the tunnel (one of them being Diaz) proceed to have this psycho-lesbianic relationship through John Malkovich by learning to control him!  It's stupid and it's trashy!  It's practically rape of John Malkovich because he has no control over this nasty relationship!<br /><br />I can't believe anyone likes this movie.  If you actually enjoy this film, you probably need some extreme psychotherapy in order to determine just where you went wrong in your life.  Just stay away from crap like this.  Go watch something better, like \\"John Carter\\" or some crap like that.  Yes, that's right, even a movie that bombed at the box office is much better than this trash.
B007G5GYHA|4.0|the movie, the script, the personality of the characters 100 points.  unfortunately, the quality of the video is really poor. I can assure my internet conection is high quality and high speed.  The movie stopping and the need of wait, pause, start again, well did not make it a super excellence experience.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|The acting was superb.  The script was well written and the film held my interest through out.  The cinematography was beautiful.  I think it is a worthwhile film to watch for getting a better understanding into family relationships.  Cloney was well cast for the part and the actors that portrayed his children also were very good.  I think that you will have an enjoyable evening with this film.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it's so cool l got all angry birds angry birds space angry birds Rio and original l love it !!!!!!!!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Well written from a different viewpoint than usual. My generation - over sixty-is not so fascinated by Nazi cruelties as those 20 years younger.  My younger relatves really liked it more than I did.  I am kimd of \\"hohum\\"  about the Nazis.  It was a long time ago and we were saturated with the stories of atrocities of war and holocast.  We have lots of new problems to think about.
B0018M6J90|4.0|I have spent no little \\"cyberspace\\" ink in the recent past swearing off femme fatales in crime noirs, mainly crime noirs from its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. I grew tired, very tired, of two-timing dames who saw nothing wrong, nothing in the world wrong, with off-handedly putting a couple of slugs in the likes of prince valiant Robert Mitchum as Jane Greer did in Out Of The Past just for trying to help her out of a jam, or seven. Fortunately after successful completion of the twelve -step femme fatale withdrawal program I am now cured, cured forever and a day, of those bad femmes.<br /><br />But what of \\"good\\" femme fatales, or wannabes, who maybe are just a little screwy (okay, okay a lot screwy) and don't even know, how to handle a rod, or want to. Just men. Well then Miss Delysia LaFosse (played, fetchingly and every other which way played by Ms. Amy Adams) is just the type for you (and me, especially sans those pistols) featured in the film under review, Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day.<br /><br />And what if all any femme fatale really needed to stay away from hard guys, hard liquor, hard grifts, and mean streets was a sort of \\"fairy godmother\\" posing as a \\"social secretary\\" (the Miss Pettigrew of the title played, every wise and wishful way by Ms. Frances McDormand of Fargo fame). Then, my friends, you would have the substance of the plot of this little romantic comedy/social commentary/ nostalgia piece (1939 just before the war, World War II in Europe when all hell will break loose, but there is just this  minute reprieve for bread and circuses).<br /><br />No need to get heavily entwined in the romantic triangle here, Ms. Adams and three beautiful young men who came of age after the war, the First World War that is, and who have \\"designs\\" on her free-wheeling spirit. Only one will win out in the end but not before Miss Pettigrew and Miss LaFosse light up the screen with their antics (and Ms. McDormand and Ms. Adams with their solid older woman/younger woman bonding). That is what drives this film. That and a rather nice tribute to old-time Hollywood screwball comedies a la Preston Sturgis and that crowd.  With no off-hand femme fatale gun play to \\"resolve\\" the fickle lifestyle dilemmas.<br /><br />And if all else fails to dignify the spirit of this film then let me end with this. View this for the torch singer (Ms. Adams) segment at the nightclub where the emotional distraught Miss LaFosse sings the old-time Inkspots classic, If I Didn't Care. Even they would have had their handkerchiefs out on that one.
B005LAIGLE|1.0|This film is a direct remake of \\"gone in 60 seconds\\" with different characters.  The direction was unrealistic, childish and painful to watch.  You keep hoping for a climax that will salvage the movie but it never comes, it only gets worse and worse and worse until the utterly stupid ending.  A genuine waste of time and money. Wahlberg must be getting desperate for scripts to be lowering himself to this garbage.  THIS FILM IS PURE SEWAGE.  Don't waste your time.

B007HO392S|4.0|1. Good Girl (8/10)<br />Great energetic start to the album. It's on par with Carrie's typical revenge-seeking stadium anthem (see Before He Cheats, Last Name, and Cowboy Cassanova). Definitely going to be a great karaoke classic.<br /><br />2. Blown Away (9/10)<br />The dramatic title track is eerily timely with all of the tornado tragedies in recent memory. Of course the song is a metaphor than so much more than a physical storm, perhaps a storm that hurts even deeper. This track really got to me with its dark subject matter and powerful vocals. If Wasted and Kelly's Because of You had an angtsy, pissed off cousin, it would be Blown Away. Love love love this one.<br /><br />3. Two Black Cadillacs (6/10)<br />What is it with country girls killing their good for nothing husbands? Dixie Chicks, Carrie? You would never hear a man singing about killing his wife. On a more serious note, I thought it was a little cheesy but catchy, nonetheless.<br /><br />4. See You Again (10/10)<br />I'm really feeling this upbeat goodbye song. I'm going to have to listen to it a few more times to really get the tone, but it seemed like a bittersweet farewell that was for the best. Carrie sounds better than ever on this track. Definitely going on repeat.<br /><br />5. Do You Think About Me (6/10)<br />This seemed like filler to me. A little too folksy for my taste. She held back in her vocals, which I can appreciate, but leave that fluff for Taylor, please.<br /><br />6. Forever Changed (8/10)<br />I read a quote from Carrie saying how she will never sing this one live because it would be too much. Apparently her grandmother suffered from Alzheimer's before she passed, similar to the woman in the song. This was a sweet, tender moment for Carrie. Not a stand-out, but certainly not one to be missed.<br /><br />7. Nobody Ever Told You (7/10)<br />This one will take several listens but the music is so damn catchy! The story of an image obsessed girl needing to find her strength within has been done before, but this was a playful take on it.<br /><br />8. One Way Ticket (8/10)<br />Wow I was not expecting the whistler and beachy feel.  Who is this girl? Where is Carrie? She's taking chances and playing with different themes and sounds. This is a summer, driving down the road, windows down crowd pleaser. I'm into it Carrie!<br /><br />9. Thank God for Hometowns (5/10)<br />The title put me off. Then I listened and it was just as I expected. I never had a \\"hometown\\" and really can't stand all of the country songs about their dirt roads and churches. I have no connection at all. Carrie's core audience will eat this up and that's great for them. (Can you tell I'm bitter?)<br /><br />10. Good in Goodbye (8/10)<br />I really enjoyed this mature reflection on a break-up. It starts of a little sleepy but picks up in the middle. As usual, Carrie brings it home in the end.<br /><br />11. Leave Love Alone (8/10)<br />This is folksy done right by me! I'm feeling this foot stomper. Strap on my overalls and pass me the banjo, I will gladly join the party. Carrie's not even saying all that much here about love, but I was totally buying it. Again, the musicianship here was fantastic.<br /><br />12. Cupid's Got a Shotgun (7/10)<br />Another fun karaoke jam. I probably will skip this one most album listens, but I appreciate the attitude and bluesy playfulness after so many serious moments so far.<br /><br />13. Wine after Whiskey (9/10)<br />This is Carrie at her best. Searing vocals and heartache is her forte. The potential for a massive single here is huge. Love love love it!<br /><br />14. Who Are You (10/10)<br />This is what I was waiting for! Finally a love song! Carrie kills it completely. She soars and you feel every word. She really means it (thanks hockey hubby!)<br /><br />Final Review: 9/10<br />Vast improvement over Play On. Right now, it still sits a little below Some Hearts but above Carnival Ride. Maybe after more listens that could change. Potential hits that I see are Blown Away, One Way Ticket, Wine After Whiskey, and maybe Cupid's Got a Shotgun. Not to say there aren't better ones, I just see those really connecting with radio.
0307593312|1.0|Ok, I'll start off by saying most of the 1 star reviews got it right. Listen to them. Second, this book is a colossal waste of time and you shouldn't read it, here is why:<br /><br />The main reason this book is such a let down is because Murakami lies to you early on. The beginning of the book actually is really good, I remember not being able to put it down for days. Many 1 star reviews are critical even of the beginning, which is a bit unjustified, but I imagine they were so upset by how things turn out later that they simply thought the whole book was horrible, alright, I can see how people would think that.<br /><br />While everything was going well up to around page 500, things flatten out and go downhill fast. The love story which many 1-star reviews criticize actually isn't bad. I'm sure many of us have had personal stories which can sort of relate. The descriptions are not too bad either. Not great, but not as bad as people are saying.<br /><br />Anyways, back to the criticism. Right when things are really heating up, Murakami enrages you by having one of the main characters take a visit to his father many miles away. This trip takes about 30 pages and is dreadfully boring. Once he gets back to Tokyo where the story is happening, you are relieved and excited for what's to come, especially as things are heating up. Then, insultingly he goes back to the place where his father is, but this time is for about 100 pages, dreadfully boring and a massive waste of time.<br /><br />Meanwhile the other main character is in a safe-house. You keep getting hints that something interesting might happen, like an amazing reunion with the other main character who she's shared a mutual love since they were ten years old. But nope, just her in the safe-house not really doing anything. Maybe a routine check-up phone-call would be the most interesting thing in the chapter. This is feeling like a different book from the first 500 pages.<br /><br />Then a main character comes backfrom his father's deathbed to where things are happening. Alright, finally things can get going again. By this time though you are upset with Murakami, you feel like you were cheated by the last 200 pages, but maybe you could overlook that if things get back on track.<br /><br />Well they don't, Murakami kicks you while you are down by making a meaningless periphery character a meaningless main character. Now, nobody liked this character as a periphery character, and his promotion to a central role just spreads confusion and anger in the minds of the readers. This character has no meaning to the story. He gets in the way by making you wait even longer to see what happens to the main characters who you actually care about. And I'll go ahead and throw in a spoiler which you won't hate me for, this meaningless character gets killed in an absolutely meaningless way which adds nothing to the story.<br /><br />On to the reunion. As other 1-star reviewers noted, it had potential to be epic, it HAD to be epic. How could it not be? Well, it wasn't epic at all. There were indeed chances for it to be epic, maybe at around page 650 or so they nearly met. Missed each other by a couple of minutes after feeling each others presence. I had chills imagining what their meeting would be like in that moment, but alas, we were let down massively. How Murakami thought they should meet was more like a business meeting in which a third party arranges their meeting place and meeting time. They simply meet according to schedule, yay. Once they meet, you feel absolutely nothing as a reader, by this point you don't care.<br /><br />There are many loose ends which don't get tied up, you don't really care though, nor do you care about anything by the end. The point is, you were punished by reading past page 500 that you are so enraged that you don't care about anything else in the story.<br /><br />The biggest sin any author can do is to waste a readers time. Murakami wasted many hours of manypeople who read this book. I was a huge fan at first, but by the end I felt like I was cheated. Like a smooth swindler who promises great things and draws you in, only to rob you of everything in the end. That's what Murakami is, a massive swindler.
B0000029DD|5.0|I had never heard of Jeff Scott Buckley until the night he went to heaven. When I asked his manager what the name of his album was, he said \\"Grace\\". I definitely did a double take and wondered why this stranger to me called me the name that my friends and family called me. Stunned, I asked him again the name of Jeff's album. He again responded \\"Grace\\". There was something very weird and special about me getting this call.<br /><br />I will not identify anyone else on the scene by name, but I will say that there definitely appeared to be no drugs or alcohol involved in any of it. I have seen erroneous reports about this tragedy and it has caused his Mother pain and I know that. It is always easier to say negative things about people, and in Jeff's case it would cause bad media and was not true.<br /><br />After I got the original call I was off work the next 2 days, my husband and I drove down to the sight and just looked. God gave me the feeling that I would be there when Jeff was recovered. Well, as soon as I came back to work that afternoon, people were calling from different countries, asking about a body being found in the river. I had no knowledge of it the first few minutes that I returned to work, but soon found out about him being recovered. I know that the media has extra close-up cameras, but when this man was found, I bent down, trying to block the camera views of his face and body.<br /><br />People cared about him, not just any fame or money. His Mother and Aunt and others came from California to try to find out what happened to her son! This was so different from other experiences that I had had from similar situations. Ex: Can I have the money out of my brother's pocket?, Can we have the money out of our roommate's room to pay his part of the rent?,Can we get the antique gun out of grandma's house, because it's worth some money, will the County bury my relative? These were disgusting to me. Jeff's Mama coming all the way to Memphis only looking to find out what happened to her son and not what she could get. They all seemed to care and Mary, Jeff's Mama, and his brother were devastated, along with his manager and all the band members and his friend Foti. I saw the devastation on all their faces and will never forget it, but I was not allowed to talk to the media then and could not tell the story. I was so disappointed when they showed a picture of a sports star in his underwear on the front of that magazine, I'm not sure, but I think that it was the Rolling Stone, instead of Jeff's picture. I fell in love with his music and voice when I 1st heard it. It was astounding to me and always has been.<br /><br />I've told Jeff's family that by what happened and when, I could tell that Jeff was using his humor to send us several messages. I ended up getting the call and my name is \\"Grace\\", he disappeared on my Friday and showed back up on my Monday, at the River and Beale St. People that don't know much about Memphis don't realize that there is Graceland, but Beale St. is the other Mecca of Memphis Music and that is where Jeff returned. I love him and his family and I am sorry that I was not allowed over 10 years ago to tell what I knew and know. He was a glorious singer, unbelievable. I hear the song Halleluiah, I can tell you that I was and am disappointed when it is not Jeff.<br /><br />I really want this to go to Jeff's Mama, but I am not very computer literate. But I was there, saw what happened afterwards and no BS will change my mind. I am not ignorant, I was an investigator and hope that I do not have trouble from this, but I really don't care. I have been reserved in what I have written, but I have only written the truth.  Love you Mary, Corey, Misty and kids.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|A Miyazaki classic. Perfect for all ages. Strongly reccomended! Beautiful, emotional, and thought provoking. Strong female lead.<br />As a young child, it was my favorite film, then I watched it again last year as a senior in college. There is so much depth to it, I did an entire film-analysis project on it! Highly, highly reccomened!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I would go into detail about the The Hunger Games Trilogy but other people have already done that. One of the best series books I have read in awhile! The Hunger Games kept me turning the page to find out what would happen next. When it comes to books, it's not easy to keep my attention.

B001OGWY1W|3.0|I saw this movie back in 2008 the day after it released, I still have the same opinion of it; over-hyped. I'm not saying its a bad movie, it just isn't a great movie like so many put it out to be.<br />***WARNING, THERE ARE SPOILERS***<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Visually this movie looks stunning, from the sets to the cgi this movie blew me away!<br />+ The acting is also a standout of this movie, from Christian Bale to Heath Ledger, the acting didn't disappoint at all.<br />+ Follows the comics for the most part, not too like the comics (Ex: Watchmen) and not too far from the comics (Ex: Ghost Rider)<br />+ When there is action its really well done and choreographed.<br />+ The boat scene at the end of the film was very well done and emotional.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not enough action: I felt as though I was watching a drama with Batman thrown in it, too many talking scenes and subplots going on.<br />- Villain problems: I also have some gripes about the villains which are as follows<br />  - For one, there was too much build up to Harvey Dents transformation into Two Face. All in all he was  only in the final quarter of the movie and we only see about 10 minutes of him, I was expecting with so much back-story of Harvey Dent, we would see more.<br />  - I also did not enjoy the route Nolan went with the Joker, in the comics he was always over the top campy but at the same time menacing. In this incarnation they dropped the camp and went with a more terrorist take. While I think it was cool to see a different kind of Joker, I did not like this one and thought they played him out way too dark (a little camp never hurts!)<br />- Batman's Voice: I didn't enjoy his voice at all and I found it very distracting.<br /><br />Overall, while it wasn't horrible, it was very disappointing in my opinion. Hopefully \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" will be better.<br /><br />My Score: 3/5

0345803485|5.0|I was truly beguiled by the books. I found it very difficult to put them down considering I have very little time for pleasure reading, and pleasurable it was. I could kick myself for not ordering the third book in the series. Now I have to wait 3 more days to finish. The characters are rich and full of intrigue. The storyline moves at a fast pace but not too fast. It's a magnificent love story so far. I cant wait to read the rest of it.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|This movie revealed to me how difficult it must be to make a good action thriller. Sure, Gina's acting is awful, even painful, but that wasn't the worst part. The movie spends long stretches of time exploring boring, tedious moments set to ridiculous, comically bad smooth jazz. You keep waiting for a reason to care, and it never comes. Watch the four action scenes on Youtube instead.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I have recently discovered Sophie Kinsella books and have fallen in love with them. The stories are entertaining and lighthearted. I was excited to read this book, but was initially worried that it was going to be a letdown. The book didn't grab my attention in the beginning like some of the other Kinsella books have (like Remember Me? and Twenties Girl). The first 20% of the book was kind of a drag, but after that it began to pick up for me. I am getting slightly bored of the same old basic situation book after book though, it seems like the details change slightly but the key players are all the same.  Average girl meets rich successful guy, guy falls in love with girl, and they live happily ever after. I would love some more variety beyond that. I think the author has the skills to do it. I was also a little annoyed with the footnotes of this book. If I had been reading a paper copy of this book it might not have been bad, but I was reading it on my Kindle. When I would click the number it would take me to the end of the chapter, then click again and it took me back, but a few times it skipped through to the next chapter and I was stuck trying to weave my way back through to find my spot. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and even stayed up late one night trying to finish it, but hoping for something new with the next one.
0345803485|3.0|Amongst all this hoopla about this book, it's obvious half of what is written is BS. For women to be unable to control themselves is a little bit perturbing. It does speak to the repression of women and especially moms all over the world. Men constantly engage in porn and women have no outlets for any of this, So they need to excite themselves in this way. So go for it then.<br /><br />During the day read books like Eat, Pray and Love to hopefully find real and sincere men. And if you're a mom, the best book I've read is MommyBest:13 Inspirational Lessons Derek & Dylan's Mom (& maybe yours) Never Learned in School. Why aren't we getting excited about taking control of our lives at home and in the career world?

0452287588|5.0|Helps you step outside of the box of everyday suffering in the cycle of unconcious cyclic thinking. Explains clearly what creates suffering, and how it's self generated- Ego.  Really life changing in how to live conciously.  Best spiritual book I read so far.

B000GG4XD8|5.0|This is one of the best albums that i have purchased in a while. One of the founders of Power Metal at their best in my opinion.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As a young guy in IT I found this book really amazing. Beginning felt like history class from sillicon valley (my fav. part) with hippies around, then it was about how industry can be changed with inovative ideas and ending was about steve's legacy and things that we do different now. Surprisingly most amazing part was about Pixar and NeXT (I didn't know much about those before), but iPod reading was also brilliant. Steve managed not only to change desktop PCs (and laptops), but also music industry (iPod) and movie industry (Pixar).<br />I never made this much highlights on kindle yet, steve was simply big jackass and said terrible stuff :)<br /><br />One star down though, it's not what I call must read book. If you don't care about Apple or Steve Jobs, just don't read it, no big deal. If you do though, start now ;) Also it seemed like Macbooks and Mac OS didn't get adequate place in the book.
B00136Q63K|5.0|[[ASIN:B000NA1OXY The Best Damn Thing]]First of all she is not a product, she is a fantastically gifted universally recognized voice who will take what she deserves in her own good time I'm sure without wasting her time reading your peoples silly opinions-She will rule in her own good time-i'm sure laughing all the way to the bank.

B0079R8IYW|4.0|I had been using the AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover and found it great protection and convenient for the Kindle Fire.  However, that case is heavy.  This Marware Exchange Case is not as heavy and the leather has a nicer feel but the stand feature is more difficult to use and not as adjustable.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />~Well-made with good stitching and nice, smooth leather.<br />~Fits Kindle Fire well.<br />~Design leaves speakers unobstructed.<br />~Stand provides two positions, one more upright and one more slanted.<br />~One large pocket & slots for business cards on inside of front cover.<br />~Front cover appears to have a magnetic closure, which is more convenient that the elastic band on the Amazon cover.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />~Not sure how well it will protect in an accidental drop as it's not as heavyweight as the Amazon cover.<br />~Pressure on the outside of the closed case in the right spot will produce action in whatever program you have active if the screensaver has not been activated.<br />~Screen positions more limited and more of a hassle than the Amazon cover.<br /><br />This cover is excellent for most uses but, if I'm traveling or going to be outdoors, I think I'll use the Amazon cover as I like the extra protection if not the weight, and it's easier to position the screen for whatever I'm doing.l
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book simply put is amazing. Her style in which she writes is so elegant. One of my favorite writers to date.
1612130283|1.0|So obviously, with 777 other people having already posted 1-star reviews, there's not really a pressing need for me to chime in ... but I like to do my part :)<br /><br />These books are not well written, the characters are neither realistic nor believable in any way, and the plot just gets more and more irritating and offensive.<br /><br />I truly do find it scary that these books apparently are putting a zing back into marriages ... wow. What does that say about your sex lives, people? Please tell me this is an urban legend.<br /><br />I had no idea that there was a connection with the much-hyped Twilight books but that makes a lot of sense and confirms my decision to steer clear of them. That's about the only benefit I can think of to having wasted my time reading all 3 of these books.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game but I cant seem to get other neighbors.  keeps reseting when doing the update and then it does not even work...I want my neighbors
B007SYWFRM|5.0|no glitches as of yet.. very fun great graphics. fun for the whole family. nothing to say there is wrong.
0802473156|5.0|This book is a well written, light read that gives remarkable insight.  After reading it you will think, \\"well how simple\\". But the impact of knowing this simple but powerful message can change your relationships (sibling, love, parental) all of them can be enriched by this book.  I just wish I would have read it sooner.<br /><br />It reminds me alot of buying a gift for someone.  You don't buy the gift YOU want, you buy something they will want.  That is precisely how we SHOULD show love.  Show it in the way that THEY want it.  I fell into the same mold as most where I would show love how I wanted it shown back, but like many relationships - he would show love to me the way he wanted . They just happen to be very different. I especially loved the quiz for you and your partner at the end.  It gives a bit of insight which way each of you express love and want it expressed back.<br /><br />So yes I would completely reccommend this book =)
B003EYVXV4|3.0|There are a lot of good things about this film.  First of all it is well cast, with both new fresh young actors Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson the leads and older, more experience actors such as Woody Harrelson in secondary positions.<br /><br />The story takes place in a dystopian future where one teenage boy and one teenage girl from each district are chosen annually to fight to their deaths in a competition called \\"The Hunger Games\\".  There's tension at the beginning as the teenagers are chosen but once they start the game part of the film, it is downhill all the way.  It got so boring that I actually fell asleep in this part.<br /><br />Basically, this film is targeted to children and, as an adult, I was completely bored.  There was no doubt in my mind how it would all turn out and the violence was pretty low key.<br /><br />Sorry, but I can't recommend this although I am sure some adolescents would like it.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|very similar to plumbing game... looks nice on my kindle fire. I hope the updates for this game will keep coming.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so far this is a really fun and easy game the acorn's are really cheep and you get your land right when you pay for it it's a good game.
B000005HLV|5.0|In the realm of Metal, few bands are as (in)famous as Mayhem.  Most Metal bands that try to act and sound evil are just vying for attention and playing the part, but Mayhem is a band that has truly earned their reputation.  It took me a while to look past the controversy surrounding the band and actually build up the courage to listen to the music, but I am truly glad I did, because this album is an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />This also served as my introduction to Black Metal (unless you count Cradle of Flith and Dimmu Borgir, which I'm not sure many people will), and what an introduction it is!  From the opening chords of \\"Funeral Fog\\" to the last of \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\", this album is completely enthralling.  Attila's vocals are some of the creepiest I've ever heard.  I personally think Dead would have been better on this album, but Attila really gives a superb performance here.  His gravelly snarls and operatic cleans are some of the best in Black Metal and send a chill down my spine every listen.  Hellhammer's drumning is also mindblowing with numerous fills and some of the tightest blast beats around.  The bass is often buried (by time and dust, one might say?) in the mix but when it does show up, it is very good.  The guitars are brilliant, some of the best in Black Metal. The atomosphere is another focal point: Truly spellbinding, chilling, and creepy as Hell. Ideal for Halloween night.<br /><br />All in all, a true masterpiece in Black Metal and a great introduction to people new to the genre.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: \\"Funeral Fog\\", \\"Buried By Time and Dust\\", \\"Cursed In Eternity\\", \\"From the Dark Past\\", \\"Pagan Fears\\", and \\"Freezing Moon\\"
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is spool epic......once in a while u may have to buy some glue credits but it is so worth it
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|For the kids - they absolutely love it and never seem to grow tired of it. I'm sure many adults enjoy it, as well. I keep it on ALL my devices, just to keep the kids occupied and it always works.
0525478817|5.0|I would really give this 4.5 stars, but I am going to round up because I don't think I've ever encountered such beautiful and careful writing as that of John Green. Each word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter are so carefully constructed and so much thought has clearly gone in to every detail.<br /><br />The characters are so believable and carry such raw human emotion, it's incredible that Green was able to take such a morose and unappealing (sorry) topic and turn it into a book that I would read not once, but again and again.<br /><br />That being said, a book about two teens battling cancer while falling in love is a book I would NEVER read. I don't like sad stories, and the premise of this book reminded me of the Lurline McDaniels books that repulsed me as a teenager. Picking up this book, the reader is very aware that there is going to be death, pain, suffering, and sadness.<br /><br />One of the most interesting relationships in the book, to me, was the relationship the narrator Hazel and her parents. \\"There is only one thing in this world sh--tier than biting it from cancer when you're sixteen, and that's having a kid that bites it from cancer.\\" Hazel worries that she is a \\"grenade\\" that will ultimately destroy the lives of her parents. The scenes between Hazel and her father, or both of her parents, especially toward the end of the book, almost moved me to tears -- the relationships were so real and true to life.<br /><br />I applaud John Green on tackling the topic of teenagers with cancer and turning this otherwise difficult topic into one of the most well-written books I've ever read. I'll definitely be reading more books by this author. Thanks for a great read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just recently got into reading erotica, and I have read some really, really good ones, and some pure rubbish. I have only read an excerpt but it was enough to say I agree with most of the reviews, that if there's a 0 star rating, this book gets it. This is definitely trash. Amazon, really? Why the hell is this book getting all the attention? When there are brilliant erotica stories out there 50, no -- 100 shades better than this! And it's a trilogy? With a movie to come? Jeez! I'm chewing my lip! And yes, the writing is crap! I can write way better than this author! For those curious as to what all the fuss is about, just read one page, and any experienced erotica reader would throw this into the trash. Don't bother!
B0058RCVYS|4.0|This was an enjoyable film that I would not have seen if I hadn't suscribed to Amazon Prime. I'm not getting any perks, etc, for reccomending Amazon Prime, but one of the features is the instant video.  While many films have a rental fee, this film was included and I would not have watched it without that incentive.<br /><br />I found the plot of this film rather predictable, but the acting was good.  I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level.  The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen. I did enjoy the film and would suggest it to people wanting a thoughtful film somewhat in the vein of [[ASIN:B004UXUX4Q The Descendants]].
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The second worse movie ever made. The first 20 minutes is a pointless idiot soap opera done in \\"shaky cam\\" which is impossible to watch, bad actors showing a fake New York stereotype yuppie ghetto wannabe lifestyle that never existed, interrupted by an improvement on Godzilla where-after the rest  of the movie is running, screaming, yelling at each-other, all done in shaky cam. This movie gets in to the same arena as Battlefield Earth for sheer unwatchableness. My left mouse button was on fast forward 90% of the time.<br /><br />It may be that people who like fake \\"reality\\" shows on television or people who watch television a lot and like idiot low-IQ dialog that's done mostly in screaming will enjoy the movie, however the movie is *not* intended for people with even average intelligence, it targets the low-IQ \\"reality\\" television-watching demographic.<br /><br />Not worth watching.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is really good it keeps you on the edge of you seat. But I recommend reading the series \\"Percy Jackson and the olympians\\" before this one
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I found Owen Wilson to be a bit uncomfortable in a few scenes but it goes with the character and could be attributed to the role. I am a fan of Woody Allen's so there are few of his movies I don't like. The first time seeing I thought some of the characterizations were a bit too exaggerated but on the second viewing I thought they were spot on.  I've always loved Mimi Kennedy and she is so natural in the mother role. Loved it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it!  because it has many games to play.But,  you got to unlock it and raise points to unlock the games.
0142405809|5.0|we read a lot of books to our children and this is on my top ten.  one of the best books to read aloud - a true gem!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I just finished reading this book. I started yesterday and could not put it down until I finished. I was one of the best books Ive read. It kept me guessing right until the end. Just when I thought I knew \\"whodunit\\", something else would happen to change my mind. That fateful day was a really bad one for the Day family. That incident, and the things that led to it, change a lot of lives for ever. I just feel bad for the people that were innocent in all of it and died so young. In the beginning, I hated Libby Day because she was acting like such a child even thought she was thirty something, but at the end I came to understand why she was acting like she was. About Ben Day, I saw him as a scared, crazy, coward teenager. I could not forgive him for what he did. Over all, the author did a great job with this story. I will for sure be reading more of her books.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love this game but it is so full of glitches its infuriating seriously update it! please! I'm begging it would be five stars then!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good games on here it keeps your mind going and it is great for kids to injoy when u r on long trips
B002ZG976U|5.0|So glad I could find it in DVD. Perfect condition. Love the extras. What can you say about a perfect product, great seller, super fast seller, great price. All good.  No that's wrong..........GREAT everything!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is essential if you read the first two books.  The book brings conclusion, answers, and finality to this series.  I find the book to be somewhat erotic, the characters to be undeveloped, and the story line to be a bit cliche.  I also cannot stand the bickering...Throughout all of the books I find the back and forth to be unnecessary for the story line and quite juvenile.  It makes me want to dismiss the characters as 12 year old kids and move on.  But, this is definitely the best of the series.  I was hoping I'd get a shock at the end of the book, but it was pretty run of the mill.  3 stars in terms of storyline and all the good book critic things I wont mention here - 4 b/c its better than the rest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game can be for the whole fam and when u have that boring feeling that u just don't know wat to do.. well this is a game u want to play :)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am pleased with this version of Mahjong on my Android Tablet.  It is easy to see the tiles and play the desired ones.  Others I have tried have been difficult to pick the desired pairs.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|its fun like Mario brothers but sometimes when u jump it doesn't let u.  and also it doesn't let u see where ur going so its easy to just fall off into the water!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Nice  graphic,sounds. Hight quality game! I do wish it is set for 3 pieces alike at a time like the real MahJong ,which it would made better sense like it...can you guy add. The extra setting?
8866130915|1.0|I have used moleskine books in previous years, but never have I had a problem with the quality of it up until this order. After opening my package, which arrived fairly quick,the strap that secured the planner broke the first time I opened and closed it. The thing about this planner is without the secure-strap, the pages, after uses and repeated folding it will flare up and won't close properly. I wish they had this one in color pink, that would also been have nice, maybe alleviated the fact that it broke down after .005 of use. I have already placed my name in the damn thing, so I'm guessing I am not able to return it. I am so disappointed. At these economic times you'd expect something that cost $10 would have a little bit more durability than a $5 one. Immediately stopped by a local office depot to a 2013 planner, a cheaper but seems to be more durable. AMAZON, IF YOU CAN READ THIS, I WANT A REFUND-- AND BETTER YET I WANT TO GET SENT A NEW 2012 PLANNER NOTEBOOK THAT IS NOT DEFECTED (since i just went out and bought a new 2013 planner; lets hope my particular purchase was defected and that I will not receive one that also breaks). After this purchase, im really hesitant about moleskine now... Or maybe its better if I had bought it somewhere else?
0596805527|2.0|As someone with a background in Java/ C#/ C++, I bought this book as a reference guide to jump-start my development (also hoped to use the examples as tutorials). However I found it far easier to Google what I needed. About 3 months into my project, I'm pretty proficient in JavaScript and this book has been largely unused.<br /><br />This book is a comprehensive reference, however just cannot compete with Googling
B004SUSZB4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I have learned, over the years, to read a book and then watch the movie if there is one. I can wholeheartedly say that the book completely outweighs the movie. I couldn't even finish the movie, as it seemed to have almost nothing in common with the book. Anyway, the book follows a woman who looses her husband to a brain tumor. Even though he is no longer with her in life, notes that he left behind help her to get through that first year without him and learn to live again. This book is written beautifully, it will make you laugh and cry.
1934030198|1.0|If you are looking to go into coaching this sport and have the goal of over informing your athlete and having it result in he/she over thinking what they are trying to accomplish, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Swimming, Biking, and Running has never looked so complicated. The further along I was in reading this book the further from being in the right frame of mind to compete or even train I became. My \\"can do\\" attitude was transformed to an \\"Oh my god I don't stand a chance\\".<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, take the early advice of the book. There is no one way to do it so you will have to find the method yourself. The best thing in my opinion to do is to get out there are learn by doing. Best of luck and see you out there!
B004MYFOEW|2.0|This was advertised as being a critical edition.  Instead it is simply the Gutenberg electronic version without helps (at least for the IPhone).  But it works for my purposes, if as somewhat of a disappointment.
B007WV05GY|1.0|Do not waste your time or money. Poorly written and conceived. I had to fast forward 85% of the movie so as not to be bored to death. Enough said.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use. good variety of different bibles to choose from. helpful finds and explanations of wording. quick and easy references to find.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game has a decent storyline and good graphic. Gameplay seems to be repetitive towards the end, but overall is pretty good. However, the game freezes several times that I need to reset my kindle, which is a bit annoying (and the reason for -1 star).
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was so excited when I first downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire. The game play was engaging and I certainly couldn't argue with the price.  However,  about 20 levels in,  many of my timers (businesses, crops, etc.) set themselves to ridiculous amounts of time. The first time it happened, I uninstalled and reinstalled, hoping that the second time was the charm. It wasn't, and I got to level 42 before the timers did it again. It's an incredibly frustrating glitch that mars an otherwise entertaining game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|when you first play you get confused until after you get the hang of it and you'll start getting in to it everytime!! :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This App has made my Kindle Fire even more useful by allowing me to access my Business computer when needed. It works seamlessly, and has been xtremely reliable
B0079R8KO0|3.0|This is and okay case for the price. Not quite what I expected. I thought that the cover was made out of nicer material, and was a tad thicker to better protect my kindle fire. It's okay though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun to kill time.  all games have instructions and are easy to learn.  a little ad heavy, but it is a free game.  cant wait to play more, this review will supposedly give tons of coins so woot for that!
0451169514|5.0|WOW! I first read IT 25 years ago and had forgotten much of the details.  IT is scary and horror filled and over 1000 pages in small print in paperback, all of this, PLUS it is written by my fav author Stephen King makes this a most incredible find.  If you like horror you will love IT.  I recommend that you read IT in the daytime or with all the lights on bright.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I had to listen to this album 3 times to<br />appreciate what Ms Howard is capable of.<br />The song \\"Hold On\\" is spectacular. She<br />needs better arrangements and back up musicians to do her justice. I had to tune<br />out the back up and just focus on her voice. I don't know anything about the<br />music industry, but whoever produced the<br />album wasn't paying attention. Ms Howard<br />is a find. She is not mediocrity, but her<br />band is. I could listen to her all day.<br />She should be BIG TIME. Her voice and<br />delivery are.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Really like this app, excellente way to keep up with reading and notes. I wish it had TTS capability as does my kindle, it is a really important feature for me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a nice, easy read.  Typical Nicholas Sparks, which is a soft romance with a happy ending.  They depicted Southport NC, which is an amazingly charming seaside village.
B007HO392S|5.0|I can't rave enough about Carrie Underwood's Blown Away Cd.  My daughter and I bought it and boogied all the way home.  Every single song is incridible.  It's become my new favorite.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game cause its so awesome. its super fun! ice age village is worth getting GET HIS GAME!
B006NFKUF6|1.0|The preview was to short mostly about talk and the controls are immposible to handle comfortably I am glad I did not spend my money on the full version
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is really fun. its great for passing time. I would recommend this app. awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun.  really passes the time.highly recommend.  been playing for about 2 weeks.  I'm up to level 22 now.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Ok so when I first download the app I'm thinking &quot;how cute!&quot; but then after Two minutes I got completely bored with it. Plus whenever I got ready to close it out IT WOULDN'T LET ME!! It scared me for a moment. Don't download it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't get the hype. Everyone around me was bugging me to read this book so I decided to try it. Usually I am pleasantly surprised when that happens. Not this time. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea but I don't find it all that great. If I wanted erotica -- I'd find erotica but to me, this was a cross between some silly school girl writing and wannabe porn.<br /><br />And if I heard \\"my inner goddess\\" one more time I might have lit my Kindle Fire on fire! Are we in junior high people? Needless to say, I will NOT be picking up books two and three. I just wish there was a way I could block ll the Facebook statuses discussing this book.<br /><br />That said, good for El James -- proud of someone from making it out of nowhere. Love when things like that happen, even if I don't like the content.
B005CAATXG|5.0|Icon for Hire has a great sound with an upbeat attitude.  Each song has a unique style that is pleasing to the ears and never tires.  The lyrics are addictive \\"positive punk\\" with the style similar to Fireflight and Superchic.  Love it.  This group is Definitely a long term musical investment for your collection of up and coming bands.  Keep it coming!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love this game so much but it needs more levels unless there is a paid version . so much fun.
0385534639|5.0|It was just a beautiful place to be for as long as it lasted.  I loved this book, one of a kind.  So very visual, and so very inventive.  I have recommended it to many people.  So glad I'm lucky enough to have an autographed 1st edition ...
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|this game says I have to wait 450hrs to get my coins from the houses and buisneses that's bs plz fix cause I really like this game !!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second in the series.  Definite read if you liked the first book, Hunger Games. I still think the first was the best but enjoyed Catching Fire.
B00589WJAM|5.0|I'm generally not into \\"retro\\" type bands or anyone who is trying to revive the music of a bygone era. The first time I saw VT, though, I was knocked on my ass by the sheer will and determination of this quartet to get everyone in the room to share their joy. The band was tight but loose (think Humble Pie or Free); the singer (James Brown by way of Terrence Trent D'Arby?) was polished but spontaneous. The performance was undeniable and the energy was infectious. Saw them again at a bigger venue (opening for the Cranberries, of all people) and they managed to do it again. Sweat, soul, grooves and charisma just oozes from the stage. Can't recommend this live band enough.<br /><br />Of course, I knew that listening to their record at home would be a different story. So often, bands like this don't capture their onstage magic in the studio. But I've been pleasantly surprised to find that the band's passion and energy has indeed imbued this LP; the songs, while certainly not ground-breaking, have a life and identity of their own, thanks to the sincerity and pathos the band infuse into the proceedings. High quality songwriting and absolutely expert execution. Just buy it.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|Anyone who thinks this movie is boring has absolutely zero culture. This isn't pretense. It's fact. This film is utterly compelling from beginning to end. The acting is some of the best ever committed to film. Perfect.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Going from an AMD quad core to the i7 2600k was such a huge upgrade it blows my mind.  This is one amazing processor.  Amazon prime is outstanding and had it to me to two days.  I would recommend this processor to everyone!  Thanks Amazon.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|There's not much else that needs to be said about this app. It could literally replace paper, it all but has in my house.

B0042RJWTM|5.0|Lee Marvin, Jack Palance and Jeanne Moreau! What a list of true iconic legends.  Monte Walsh is truly a real representation of the \\"Old West\\"! I live in Arizona and have seen the West that most people have only dreamed of seeing.  Monte Walsh, filmed 30 miles south of Benson, Arizona, and the King Anvil Ranch, 30 miles west of Tucson. Tombstone with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, filmed near Mescal, Red River, 35 miles southeast of Nogales to name a few.  Monte Walsh shows the rugged, harsh and dirty that was the West. Yes, Tom Selleck played the role but he does not possess the \\"realness\\" of the West. Marvin and Palance played it as if it was in the time period of the 1880's. Being a 4th generation Arizonan and lived on a cattle ranch in my younger years, as portrayed in Monte Walsh is as real at it can get.  The romance of cattle ranching is not as portrayed in the \\"average\\" western; rather the dust, dirt, heat, and a hardscrabble existance when times \\"git rough\\" is well portrayed in this movie. No two performers could have portrayed it better! And of course, the music composed by the renowned John Barry and the vocals done by \\"Momma Cass\\" makes Monte Walsh a true classic in all ways.  It is one of my favorites in my enormous collection of western DVD's.  Enjoy!!!

B002G1YPH0|4.0|When I first turned my computer on after installing this cooler I actually had to touch the fan briefly just to make sure it was on -- it was that quiet!<br /><br />The only downside to this cooler is its size and the instructions. The size works in its favor, 34 C idle temp, and against it. Since it's so large, I cannot use a traditional method of pushing the air toward the top-rear vent because my ram would partially obstruct the air intake. I'm going to need to modify my case to vent out the side. As for the instructions, it's a simple installation made confusing when you try to follow the diagrams.
0345803493|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book, I was so squeamish about reading the first, but decided to \\"go for it\\" by taking on book two, basically because of the cliff hanger in book 1.<br /><br />What's Ana to do?  She meets the love of her life, cannot imagine anyone being as captivating as he......there's just this one teensy thing....ya, he's a freak and just might be way too freaky for her.  At end of book 1 she leaves him, convinced that their relationship is doomed because of this.  To the relief of this reader, it only takes about 10 pages in of book 2 before Ana decides to give Mr. Grey another chance.... because he has another \\"proposition\\" for her - and it's not weird or kinky or gross; it's sweet and for Ana - worth trying.<br /><br />So begins the evolution of the relationship & because he's such an unusual & unpredictable character; it's an interesting tale. He's not your usual \\"romantic hero\\".  The reader finds out much more about Mr. Grey and how he became \\"Fifty Shades of @#$&$-up\\".  We get to meet some of the more unsavory characters, a la Mrs. Robinson.<br /><br />The book is not Hemingway; I don't think there are deep symbolic meanings in the writing.  But, the author, I believe with these characters, does provide insight into:  Unconditional love, acceptance, healing, and intimacy.  Particularly intimacy, I loved the fact that Ana & Mr. Grey negotiate their own little \\"kinky\\" world that it theirs alone; I found the intimacy & trust in that to be endearing.<br /><br />So, go ahead - read it, if you made it through the first book without freaking out - this is your reward.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My inner child is something I value most, and that inner child remembers my days of being a little kid and playing with my Iron Man and Captain America toys, as well as wishing I was the Incredible Hulk. I also remember watching the Hulk cartoons and begging my parents to get me the latest issue of of the next Captain America comic books. So as you can tell, I'm a comic books have played a huge role in my childhood, and that being said, it was with great excitement that I awaited The Avengers. Having seen all the Avengers movies until then and owning them all on blu-ray, I remember even watching them all up until Thursday May 3rd, which was when the midnight premiere took place. My buddy and I even wore Iron Man masks to the screening.<br /><br />I'm most happy to report, to say The Avengers did not disappoint is an unforgivable understatement. It may just be the best comic book movie I've ever seen. It shines dozens of lamps on The Dark Knight and it makes the previous Avengers movies (even Thor, which I loved despite not having been familiar with the Thor mythos before seeing it) look like the Fantastic Four movies.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was pitch perfect. Starting with the script. Joss Whedon had penned the script and it's obvious he has done his homework on not just the mythos and everything else in the world of The Avengers, but also what the audience loves about the heroes and expects from a movie about The Avengers. Everyone was given a sense of humour and played their cards right- Tony Stark was his usual lovable jerk self, and had his typical attitude problems that were hard not to love. He was given a great amount of action as well and the scene near the end where he pushes the nuclear bomb into the portal was purely beautiful intensity. Captain America was his usual kickass self, and every one of his action scenes were hard to not love. Thor was hilarious as well and his scenes with Loki were just amazing. Particularly the scene near the end on Stark tower where he forces Loki to watch the mayhem going on in the city and asks \\"Is this what you want?\\". Aso, FINALLY the Hulk has had justice done. He's given a sense of humour, which the other movies absolutely failed on. I'm happy to report the movie did not fail there. And who can forget the dialogue? Classic Avengers dialogs, down to the last inch. \\"We need a plan of attack!\\" \\"I have a plan. Attack.\\" and \\"WhTs the matter, not fond of thunder and lightning?\\" \\"I don't like what comes after.\\"<br /><br />The characterization is really what counts here too. Obviously if you're going to a movie called The Avengers for a character study you're going to the wrong movie (and you need to lay off the artsy movies too, as they're clearly doing serious stuff to your brain), but for the type of movie it is, it's done supremely well. Each character is unique in their own right- I've already mentioned the eponymous superheroes, but Black Widow is one sexy and fun character that's hard not to love. Her action scenes are just incredible and her backstory, while thankfully kept to a minimum is interesting as hell. Hawkeye is stone cold and scary in the first half when  possessed by Loki, then is cool and badass near the end when he resides to kick some Loki butt.<br /><br />The movie is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen thanks to lots of clever, Whedonian humour and appropriately placed Comic book style exaggeration. The scene where Hulk smashes Loki around like a rag doll made me laugh harder than anything in 21 Jump Street and any other comedy this year. And the scene where Hulk sucker punches Thor!<br /><br />The performances are amazing as well. Pure commitment from all involved, with Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth, as well as Johannson, Smulders, Jackson, Hiddleston and Renner giving amazing performances all, but Ruffalo is the real surprise here. He brought something new to the table here as Hulk- every line he spoke sounded like he was trying hardto hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling. His monologue about how he tried committing suicide was delivered very chillingly beautifully. He was the biggest surprise and got everything about the Hulk perfect. Props to Ruffalo for FINALLY getting The Hulk exactly right!!!<br /><br />I'm going to conclude my review with one more little piece of praise. Whedon is my favourite TV writer And he's managed to make me proud to be a comic book nerd. Justice was done to the best superheroes ever and I can tell superhero movies are going to not be the same ever again. A big thanks to Ll involved for the commitment and true dedication to making ths movie possible, and the great success it was. I've seen this movie twice already and I can't wait to see it again and again. Now I've only got two more words to say: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!to hold back his inner monster and boy was it chilling.

0439023513|3.0|As much as I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books - this was a bit of a disappointment.  It didn't seem to have the tight pacing and got a little muddled....too many scenes..Could have used a bit more editing of scenes to only use those that advance the plot & maintain a sense of suspense or doom.<br /><br />That said, we finally get a look into District 13 and again, the author intrigued me with the strange yet fascinating everyday details of a totally different world.<br /><br />The ending was the muddled part - it could have been clearer.  It doesn't end sadly, but neither does it end happily.  But, I do think it ends as it should.
0307956350|3.0|This book is really well written. Descriptions of scenes are wonderful.  As a thriller it lacks credibility however.  Characters spend their lives keeping secrets only to fess up to crimes in a restaurant at the end.  So, the book is wonderful throughout, but I don't think this is the right ending.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I am confused. I had purchased this game for my Kindle Fire, and it worked perfectly without having to use the internet(wi-fi on kindle fire). NOW when I try to start the game it says I have to have an internet connection to play. I am not around wifi areas all the time. I payed $2.99 for this game, I should be able to play it without the internet. I don't understand, is anyone else having this problem?

And there were even a few parts that made my jaw drop! I totally recommend this book to anyone... even if you think you wont like it.... you probably will.

B007Z9RAX4|4.0|Although I would venture to say this movie was really more of a 3.5 in my book, since I had to chose 3 or 4, I decided to round it up to 4 rather than mark it down any more.  While I felt the plot could have been strengthened a little and that some of the acting was kinda subpar, I felt that in the end it was a decent movie and did have a fairly good premis.  Plus, the action scenes in it, I must admit, were pretty awesome.  She kicked some serious @$$ on many occasions throughout this movie.  If you're an action/thriller fan, give this movie a watch.

B007MJSQSK|5.0|I loved the movie.  A mix of Tintin and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Of course I love Tintin and I have a collection of all his books in French.  What I missed is the humour of the French language which can't be translated.  Captain Haddocks' jurons (if you can call them bad words) which are unique in the French litterature and Milou's reflexions about humans' strange behaviour.  On the whole if you like Tintin, Indiana Jones and of course the magic of Spielberg's movies you'll really enjoy it.
0439023513|3.0|So to start I would like to say that I have read many of the different reviews with this book.<br />It has taken me some time find out what I want to say about it; I am still not sure. lol<br />I really have enjoyed reading the Hunger games. However, I find this last one missing something. Heck im not even sure, but it is missing some thing. The end also surprised me a bit, I had it pictured a bit different.<br />However, I would still have to say it is a good book and I did enjoy reading it.<br /><br />Just cannot help but wonder about the other craters!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|John Madden's \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" may not be a great film, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. It isn't challenging in the slightest, which has caused many critics to downgrade it, or damn it with faint praise. All I know is that the audience in the packed theater where I saw the film applauded at the end, and I applauded with them.<br /><br />By now everyone knows the story of \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\\" A group of English retirees decides for various reasons (mostly financial) to move to India. The retirement hotel they choose sounds glorious from the brochure, but turns out to be a rundown, if once-grand, hulk run by a young Indian with much more enthusiasm than skill. A lot of comedy ensues, and a little conflict and tragedy; attitudes are changed, old bonds broken, and new bonds forged.<br /><br />The ensemble cast of British character actors ranges among the super-famous (Judi Dench, Maggie Smith), the moderately famous (Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) and the not-so-famous (Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie), with the addition of one young rising star (Dev Patel, of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" fame). All of them are as charming, funny and touching as they possibly could be. Meanwhile, Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker do an excellent job of blending and articulating the various plotlines, aided by the gorgeous photography by Ben Davis and the insinuating score by Thomas Newman. Considering the effort all these master professionals made to give an audience a good time, it seems churlish to give \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" any less than five stars.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|There's been so little marketing for this movie in the U.S. (What's up with that, Magnolia Films?) that I wasn't expecting much.  I rented this anyway, mostly out of curiousity and because I enjoyed the book.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film.  The actors were well-suited to their roles and the costuming and sets were absolutely delicious (and true to period).  The movie did feel a little \\"rushed\\" to me; the screenplay relied so heavily on dialogue to provide the exposition that, if you missed a line, you could miss 4 months in the lives of the characters.  Since I am familiar with the book, this was less of an issue for me but it's the reason I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Well worth the $9.99 I paid to rent this, especially since Amazon gives me 48 hours to watch (as opposed to the 24 hours on iTunes) and without the 2-hour \\"download\\" required elsewhere.  I plan to watch again tonight!  :-)
0345803485|1.0|I don't often leave a review for the books I read, and I read often, at present I have over 2000 books and over 1000 on my kindle, I like to read and I read everything from fanfiction to Hunger Games to Classics.  I read anything from nonfiction to romance novels.  I just wanted to let you know I do read and do read alot, never without something to read.  I personally like to read romance or erotica, they are easy reads with little thought process for those times you just don't feel like a heavy read.  I tell you this as background, because I hate giving bad reviews for anything, I feel everyone should read and good for James for doing something she loves.<br />  That being said, this book was just not worth my time, I could not believe it had such high ratings.  The sex scenes were not that great, the dialog was boring, and overall the story was just not plausible.  You can tell it was originally written as Twilight fanfiction and then the names were changed, there are just to many comparisons.  If you want to read fanfiction then pick any number of the online sites and read them.  There are thousands of stories, and some are exceptional, even better than the originals, and you do not have to fork over ten dollars to read those.  There are even many BSDM stories that are far better than this so called one.<br />  There are plenty of books that deal with BSDM, hundreds are free to be downloaded to a kindle or even your computer, try some of those, they can't be any worse than this one.
0393088774|4.0|Just finished the book.  This review will start out by giving a detailed table of contents.<br /><br />Chapter 1: How Bad Things Are.  Lays out the terrible costs of 9% unemployment.  Krugman states we should be angry because it is all so unnecessary.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Depression Economics.  The basic model of effective demand is layed out to explain what is happening.  Households are deleveraging and business is not investing, the result is that income has fallen.  Krugman explains a liquidity trap and why it limits the usual policy tool of monetary policy to solve our crippling lack of demand.<br /><br />Chapter 3: The Minsky Moment.  Hyman Minsky developed a model that showed that a build up of debt can lead to economic instabilty.  The chapter quickly goes through some 1930's history.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Bankers Gone Wild.  Goes over some recent history of deregulation and the rise of shadow banking.  Also covered the increasing debt of households and the increasing leverage within financial institutions.<br /><br />Chapter 5: The Second Gilded Age.  Krugman attempts to answer why income and wealth inequality have been rising.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Dark Age Economics.  In the 1970's many economic departments became dominated by the rational expectations crowd.  They assume people are rational and that markets work, assumptions which preclude an economy being laid low by a lack of effective demand.  Krugman goes over how the new crowd (freshwater) ends up explaining recessions, by way of real business cycle theory.  Krugman explains their differing policy recomendations for ending the slump.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Anatomy of an Inadequate Response.  Goes over Obama's stimlus and why it was too small.  Explains the political reason why there has been almost no mortage relief for households.<br /><br />Chapter 8: But What About The Budget Deficit.  Explains that in a liquidity trap deficits do not lead to rising interest rates.  Explains that replacing household debt with govt debt is necessary to get effective demand back up and what the long term effects of this really is.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Inflation: The Phantom Menace.  Once again the liquidity trap prevents loose monetary policy from having its normal inflationary impact.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Eurodammerung.  Goes over Europe's problems.<br /><br />Chapter 11: Austerians.  \\"Very serious people\\" believe govt budget austerity is needed to get economic growth going on a sustainable path.  Krugman obviously does not agree.<br /><br />Chapter 12: What It Will Take.  Goes over the govt spending that will be necessary to end this depression.<br /><br />Chapter 13: End This Depression.  All too quickly covers the politics.<br /><br />Postscript.  Goes over recent research on govt spending and its effects on economic growth.<br /><br />How will this book be recieved?  All too easy to know that one side of the ideological divide will cheer and the other will jeer.  Economic debates, among these people, has descended into a bitterness beyond reason.  However, Krugman wrote this book for those not ideologically inebriated, those who are ideologically sober enough to weigh good arguments.  How they will receive it is a key question.
B003UCPEJ2|4.0|All is fine.<br />I can not inmagine the quality in 1960's has reached such a high level. I was really shocked.
B007C9N4H8|4.0|This relaunch of the Muppets was obviously a trip down nostalgia lane. I think by and large it succeeds. The film sets up a clever way to get the Muppets back together, both acknowledging their long absence and making a story out of it. The villains and story seem like they could have come out of the 1980s classics. Best of all, we get some of the Muppets' classic humor, including breaking the 4th wall. If I had one disappointment, it was with the human actors. Jason Segal is relatively new, but Amy Adams I'd always loved for her unbridled energy and enthusiasm. However, they're mostly used in the song and dance numbers. In fact, I think the movie tried to do too much by forcing their love drama into the movie along with all of the other plot elements. Still, overall I hope this movie does bring the Muppets back to prime time and that we see more of our favorite green frog.

These types of books are for pure entertainment.  I'm very happy that the reviewer who could not finish the book and could write a novel about how bad it was.

0345803485|5.0|My disclaimer: This was my first erotica, fan-fiction based read, and I am not into BDSM!<br /><br />Having said all that, I  Loved  it!<br />Although the racy subject matter is the reason for all the buzz, at it's core  Fifty Shades is a love story.  Yes, parts are far fetched, but if you can forgive the unrealistic bits, the characters take over.  The back and forth within Ana and Christian's  relationship felt authentic to me and I found myself needing to know what was going to happen to them.<br /><br />I think anyone who has really loved someone - who was not the best choice for them, will identify with this.  I accepted this book for the escapism it is and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Mentally I file the Fifty Shades series right next to potato chips.  No nutritional value whatsoever, but completely satisfying none the less!

Vonnegut's use of prose weaves the zany, the quirky, the tragic, and the realistic all into one beautiful quilt, a pattern of images that sticks with you forever.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle was the first novel I ever read by Kurt Vonnegut, but it has encouraged me to continue through his work.<br /><br />The plot concerns itself with Jonah, our loyal narrator who is researching the family of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, and his connection to the development of the atomic bomb. Through this link, Jonah, and the reader, is introduced to his children, who are all unique in their own way. Saying anymore than this might spoil the story, which is very interesting.<br /><br />Vonnegut's prose is very frank and efficient. This does not necesarily mean it's austere, however. Often time Vonnegut uses metaphors or seemingly unrelated topics/imagery to convey his ideas and/or theme. The end product is fantastic.<br /><br />This book is fit for almost anyone. If you are here, reading this review, thinking about reading this book, then it has already piqued your interests. Read on! And read quick!<br /><br />The First time I read this novel was in 8th Grade. I thought I understood it then. I was very wrong. I have since returned to it, even if just for a few pages of light perusal. This has remained one of the best books I've ever read. I urge you to try it out!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I was having a really great time playing this game, alas as I was looking forward to unlocking the 'Troop Trample' ability which is said to be available after round 40. I played for multiple days, hours at a time to beat round 40, and now, as I am on round 41 the 'Troop Trample' ability is not showing up as available. So until this is fixed I am stuck using my older abilities.
B000BPG2JC|5.0|Craig Johnson writes like his characters are his best friends. Warmth, humor, caring - all of these describe his work. I can't wait for his next book!
B007WOQLHS|1.0|I really liked this book, but don't get it in the Kindle version, at least not yet.  This version is incomplete, and you don't even get to what I think are the best parts of the story.  I'm surprised that Amazon hasn't taken it off yet.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok until you get stuck on a stupid game you have to play to earn enough points to buy another set of games. some of the games are good to play for a while.
B0000AMRJD|1.0|I'd been looking forward to watching this one.  I've had the DVD for several years and finally decided to break open the packaging and watch this tonight.  What a major disappointment.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be a movie about Al Capone or Chicago gangsters or something of that nature.  It's not.<br /><br />This movie has no likable characters, a bad story, and some pretty bad acting.  There is nothing redeeming or uplifting about the story. It is a total downer.  I kept waiting for some turn to come in the story or an arc of change in the characters.  Everyone becomes worse and worse during the course of the movie and in the end I turned off the DVD player and was glad the whole mess was over.<br /><br />I'll give the film some credit for some decent sets and production quality.  The film does fairly well at capturing the disco era and all of the excess that went with it.  And speaking of excess, there is way too much profanity in the movie.  I don't care if these types of characters would really talk like this.  In the final analysis, I don't see that there was any good point to telling the story of these characters.<br /><br />Not recommended for watching other than by students of bad film or masochists who want to subject themselves to nearly 3 hours of emptiness.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I have enjoyed this game a lot, but I suggest that the creators of this game should make the game more exciting during the game and when you win or lose. Overall, this game is pretty good.
B0026NBZDU|2.0|The story is unique and interesting enough to read but not one of my favorites at all.  The twists and turns are too numerous and hard to keep straight.  Not sure the plot is plausible enough to buy into.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I like Willam Macy and Matt Mac, but i was iffy about this movie, but i was iffy about this movie because they trailers. But something told me to give it a chance, and i glad i did.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all three novels in the series and was awestruck. They were excellent. I don't want to see the movies for fear of dissappointment. I don't think anything could beat the books. I really recommend these to anyone who loves action.

B003O86FMW|5.0|After finished the first book, I couldn't wait to read the next.  However it started out slow.  It took a little too long for me to get going again, but once it did I was so glad I was patient with it.  If you loved the first book, there is no way you can't love the second.  I love the \\"Quarter Quell.\\"
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I love action movies so its hard to rate this movie because I love Gina's action scenes and really hope to see her in more movies. I also loved the supporting cast in this movie as well. So why do I have a problem. First fire the guy who picked the music for this movie. The music sucks balls omg did a proper lady like my self say that. Yes I did because that is how much I disliked the music that I risked my proper lady like self to write something my boy friend would say. You don't take an action movie and add weird creepy 70's music to it.<br /><br />They took a potentially good movie and some how messed it up. First you don't know why anything is happening so instead of getting intrigue somehow you get confused which causes the movie to get boring it does not keep you engaged(plus your mind is trying to escape the weird music so you fall asleep lol) Since, you dont know what the heck happens or why as if some how the purpose got lost somewhere. You don't get engaged like you do with Bourne identity. I only mention that because while you dont know what happens in that movie in the beginning your engaged because the character has purpose he needs to find out who he is. with this movie you don't get to know who your protagonist is and so the movie gets lost somehow.<br /><br />The fight scenes were nailed an awesome really done well and Gina is likable. Something went wrong in this movie and I hope they correct it because would love to see Gina come back with her in the lead or even a second but this time well done hay wire 2 this time get the director of the Avengers(Joss Whedon) he understands what we need when it comes to action Hero's. Gina ask Joss Whedon to Direct your next move you wont be disappointed and your stardom will be Born.<br /><br />However, as an action Hero lover I still saw this movie for a second time just because I love me some Gina kickass action even if I had to endure some sleepy time. Please please Joss save Gina and Direct one of her nextmovies as long as your the writer Joss you can help her.  I rated the movie higher than I should only cause I loved Gina and thinks she deserve a chance

B003O86FMW|5.0|Youlle be catching the next book because this series is on fire! This book is semi shocking in some scenes but then its also very frustrating in a good way though! The frustrating part relates to one scene(i dont want to spoil) where youll be like 'noooo this cant be possible whats going to happen!!!!' Very good one word that says it all is AMAZING AMAZING AND MORE AMAZING!! I thought about this series throughout the day and throughout the night i even dreamt about it!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Too many people fell the third book swayed from the first two.  It had too and the story was the best one yet.  As soon as I finished it, I had to go back and read the whole trilogy over again.  When I finished a second time, I knew that Mocking Jay ended the series very very well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The odds will be in your favor when you buy this book!This book was very good,infact i would think about it when i wasnt reading it! I was definetly hungry for some games! When you read this you dont know who should win,peeta or katniss. I couldnt thin kof how this book was going to end and was catching on to the book as fast as a wildfire does. When you read this book, i recommend you to buy all three because its really catchy and very sad! I hope people will like this dytopian novel because its on my top ten dystopian novels!'by the way mockingjay was the most shocking book while hunger games was the most loveyish book and catching fire was semi shocking and kept you thinking...
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|\\"The Avengers\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow answer the call to action when Nick Fury, director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., initiates a daring, globe-spanning recruitment effort to assemble The Avengers team to defeat an unexpected enemy threatening global safety and security. Despite pulling together the ultimate dream team, Nick Fury and longtime confidant Agent Coulson must find a way to convince the Super Heroes to work with, not against each other, when the powerful and dangerous Loki gains access to the Cosmic Cube and its unlimited power.<br /><br />The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Chris Evans (as Steve Rogers / Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (as Bruce Banner / The Hulk), Chris Hemsworth (as Thor), Scarlett Johansson (as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow), Jeremy Renner (as Clint Barton / Hawkeye), Tom Hiddleston (as Loki), Clark Gregg (as Agent Phil Coulson), Cobie Smulders (as Agent Maria Hill), Stellan Skarsgard (as Selvig) & Samuel L. Jackson (as Nick Fury) is excellent. The directing by Joss Whedon (who also wrote the screenplay & co-wrote the story) is brilliant. The story by Zak Penn & Whedon & the screenplay by Whedon is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Alan Silvestri is brilliant. The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is brilliant. The film editing by Jeffrey Ford & Lisa Lassek is brilliant. The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller is brilliant. The production design by James Chinlund is brilliant. The art direction by Benjamin Edelberg, Jann K. Engel, Gregory S. Hooper, Billy Hunter, Richard L. Johnson (supervising art director) & Randy Moore is brilliant. The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo is brilliant. The costume design by Alexandra Byrne is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by R.A. Rondell, Chris O'Hara, Jonathan Eusebio & Hank Amos is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Chris Brenczewski & Daniel Sudick are brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Erik Nash, Janek Sirrs, Colin Strause, Greg Strause & Guy Williams are brilliant. The make-up effects supervised by Stephen Bettles, Thomas Floutz & Kevin Kirkpatrick are brilliant.<br /><br />This is a well-made and well-done film that is fun (sometimes, funny as well), entertaining and thrilling at the same time. This is also a well-designed film, as well. The cast is brilliant well-chosen and have terrific chemistry together. Joss Whedon has made a terrific and brilliant movie that is just as brilliant as its characters' origin story movies; maybe even, a little more. This is also a film that will keep your mind thinking, as well. This is also one of the best movies of the summer (also one of the best films of the year), possibly, the best, and it is also one of the best movies to start off the summer season, as well, too.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have to agree with previous reviewers.  This is a fabulous movie, capturing the epic sweep of Burrough's vision.  It exceeded my expectations, too, and I had very high hopes for it.  It was sabotaged at the box office by one of the worst marketing campaigns I've seen.  This movie will be a science fiction classic!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Seen this movie twice already and it was just as enjoyable the second time. This is such a well done movie with plenty of awesome action, intensity and some great one liners. The way the movie builds up to one of the most bad @$$ battles I have ever seen is just perfect. So much tension between all the super heroes and the way they come together gave me goosebumps. Highly recommended if you haven't seen this yet and I would say see it multiple times because you will just want to!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|As soon as I finished \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" I started \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" and found I enjoyed book two as much as book one. I was concerned I'd find it repetitious, however, I enjoyed the characters so much, I didn't find it so. Again, the author infuses her book with humor, romance, mystery and sex but it's her characters' relationships that I found most intriguing. Some folks may get bogged down in the sexual exploits of the characters. Don't - its all a fun journey about the growth of two people and their growing relationship.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game so much and I was so excited that it FINALLY is on Kindle Fire! ! it is working so awesome for me and no problems at all! ! so happy! ! GET IT! !
0345803485|5.0|Always being concerned about spoilers let me just say that I really enjoyed this book. I found it to be a fun and fast read. It has a little bit of everything - humor, sadness, romance, mystery, classic and kinky sex - quite a bit, but  not too much, of kinky sex. I found the characters intriguing and really liked them regardless of their questionable behavior. I found myself routing for their relationship. Suggestion - don't overlook the e-mails the two main character share, many are surprisingly funny. A book such as this could have been pure porn, but this book had substance. I had trouble putting it down.

0307951529|4.0|This is the latest book from world traveler and and business guru Chris Guillebeau, whose previous book, The Art of Non-Conformity, was about his unusual approach to life and business in today's world.<br /><br />I'll admit I am biased about his work. I find a lot of resonance with my own life, and have purchased some of his other business information products from his web site.<br /><br />This book includes some of the wisdom and experience in those other products, which the author learns not only firsthand, but also gleans from other successful entrepreneurs.<br /><br />The focus of the book is to help people start small businesses which require minimal startup capital, and leverage the person's knowledge or interests in the fast evolving marketplace we have today. Some examples are of local businesses, some are internet-based.<br /><br />The hallmark of the author's approach is practical, inventive solutions to business problems. Many times, the solutions are counter-intuitive, at least in the sense of regular business advice. This doesn't mean he ignores proper business practice, just that he encourages people to think about life and business in ways other than the slick, Madison Avenue programming crammed down our throats on a daily basis.<br /><br />Guillebeau's approach is about independence, taking back one's life, living the life one wants, and creating ways to earn money to support that. His books and materials all integrate with that philosophy, and yet do not neglect the basics of running a business in a profitable way.<br /><br />This book outlines a methodology and mindset for finding and creating your own small (or not so small) business to enable you to live on your own terms as much as possible. Multiple examples are given, as well as marketing information, organization and planning, and the great big number one issue: customer service. (For example, learn about the most successful tuk-tuk driver in Cambodia....including contact info for the next time you are in Phnom Penh.)<br /><br />While his ideas are sometimes at odds with \\"conventional wisdom,\\" I have found that he has  much better business radar than said \\"wisdom,\\" which is usually little more than codified laziness or marketing fluff anyway.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who either wants to start, or is already running, their own business. The information is timely, intelligent, and grounded in today's world.<br /><br />I also recommend his other book and information products.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is great. I (and my mom) have both wasted entire days attached to the wall playing the game trying to out do each other.

Have also never had a problem with accidently spending real $$ in game. (Fell asleep and purchased land by accident, but i wanted it anyways.) Can earn acorns quickly enough if continous play, have already spent 40 and have earnd 25 more in only 3 or 4 days.<br /><br />I do have problems with visiting...anyone. Could not find the neighbor request my mother sent me nor she find mine.

1455508977|2.0|I am not a Nicholas Sparks fan really.. I do not really care for his books or movies.. but my BFF wanted to see the movie so she purchased the book so we could read before hand.. I have to say that with Sparks I have found the movies to be much better than his books.. The Lucky One is full of info.. that the reader just does not need to know or even care about.. not to mention the author cont. tells us what he meant by what he has just said.. he actually explained what crabs were when they went to a resturant and the customers have to yell out \\"we have crabs\\" when Logan and Beth set down.. Sparks explains that crabs is a STD.. like we did not know this.. Anyway.. the book has four main characters.. Logan..  a soilder who finds a picture during the war of a women and he carries the picture and his friend thinks it is Logans lucky charm.. after Logan does not reup he decides to find the woman who saved his life numerous times..Zeus.. Logan's German shepherd.. who walks with Logan fron CO to NC.. Elizabeth.. the women in the photo who is struggling with the death of her brother who was also a marine like Logan.. #who lost the picture in the war#..and Keith.. Elizabeth pyscho ex husband who is a bad dad and womanizer.. The book had some good parts but most fell flat.. Logan was not much of a talker.. Elizabeth was without much life.. Zeus was the best dog ever.. and the best part of the book.. Keith.. well he was a jerk..  Sparks gives his normal ending to his book tragedy and some type of closure. The movie however did not really stay on task with the book.. Zeus made a few apperances which was bad for the movie as he was a key player in the book.. Normally I would always say read the book first.. but in this case.. do it either way.. because both are not that great and do not really coincide with each other.. The book and the movie have one very important thing in common tho.. Elizabeth and Logan do not seem to have the mind blowing attraction for each other the mediaseems to be pushing down our throats.. I had to make myself finish the book and I skipped alot of the useless fillers that Sparks insist on..

B000S81MHY|4.0|I bought the big clunkers at Harbor Freight and Northern Tool, but they were heavy and not accurate. This is a little table that is light weight and smooth. A sub-plate was used to mount the table to my bench top drill press. The table is too small to use the typical mounting points on full sized machinery. Have had it for a week and it works well on the small plastic parts I make. I also bought the end mill set that should serve my needs.[[ASIN:B002YPHSIG End Mill Set, 6 Piece 4 Flute]] I labeled the wood storage block to easily keep the sizes straight.<br />Just be aware that it is a SMALL table, don't expect to work on anything more than a few inches in length or width.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|\\"The Avengers\\" delivers on the promise of the other Marvel films with a rip-roaring adventure filled with snappy dialogue, good performances, great action sequences and terrific visual effects that supports a well written, directed story from Joss Whedon.<br /><br />Should you see it in 3D? The film was shot with 3D in mind so a number of scenes benefit from it but, quite honestly, it would work just as well as a regular theatrical presentation. Since I don't have the Blu-ray 3D I can't review that aspect but I can review the two disc Blu-ray/DVD combo.<br /><br />Image & Sound: A top notch Blu-ray transfer with deep, rich blacks, nice detail, depth and bold colors, \\"Marvel's The Avengers\\" looks and sound brilliant. The Lossless soundtrack is audio demo quality with excellent use of the surround speakers, detail and, again, imaging/depth. Dialogue is always to the forefront where it's needed to be.<br /><br />Subtitles are provided in English as well as providing descriptive services for the blind.<br /><br />The special features are good but a bit disappointing in that there aren't more of them covering the details I was interested in. I would have loved to see a special feature on the comic book, it's evolution and a discussion with Joss Whedon as to why he chose this line up (which isn't quite the original as in the original 1960's comic book). It also would have been nice to provide some of the vintage comic books in a digital format as an example of the story elements that Whedon borrowed for the film (including the reboot of Nick Fury since originally he looked nothing like Samuel L. Jackson and was revised to look like the actor--a bit of irony considering that he wasn't offered the role until a decade later).<br /><br />We do get two fine featurettes that provide us with behind-the-scenes footage, talking heads discussing what attracted them to the film/roles. Whedon is as always effusive and entertaining particularly during the commentary track where he discusses the decision to shoot the film without a 3D rig and do a post conversion (he shares his experience with shooting the tag at the end of \\"Thor\\" in 3D which was added to that film to set up this film). He also discusses his approach to the characters and the mission that Marvel gave him in making the film.<br /><br />Deleted/extended scenes are an interesting addition. We get an alternate opening and closing for the film both of which involve Cobie Smulders' character giving her a larger role in the film. This footage was wisely excised in my opinion. We also get footage of Captain America brooding over Peggy and although interesting it would have been far more interesting to see him actually go and try and meet her (although they would have to figure out a way to tie it into the larger narrative). (SPOILER) There are also extended scenes including a scene between Loki and Hawkeye where the latter gives Loki the information that sends him on his mission to disrupt The Avengers. That little scene explains how he knew what he was doing would break the team apart but it also would have spoiled us discovering what his true purpose was in allowing himself to be captured. (END OF SPOILER).<br /><br />Finally we get a gag reel and trailers for other films. I'm sure there are probably Easter eggs but I haven't discovered them yet on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The DVD comes with one featurette and the commentary track.<br /><br />Oh, and make sure to stick around post-credits for an amusing scene involving the heroes doing something Tony Stark suggests earlier at the conclusion of the film. Notice that Captain America's face is blocked by his hand. That's because the scene was shot after completion of shooting and Chris Evans was growing a beard for his next role.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />When an intergalactic threat spearheaded by Loki (Tom Hiddleston)to obtain the mysterious and powerful Cosmic Cube (a major plot point in \\"Captain America\\" and seen, briefly, in \\"Thor\\") arises, Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)is forced to call together a dysfunction team of superheroes--Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and, later, Thor (Chris Hemsworth)to battle Loki and get the Cosmic Cube back before Loki can obtain his objective--to open a portal for an invading alien army.<br /><br />Eventually the team gets past their dislike of each other/rivalry to work as a team.  They may not like each other but they each have a role to play and embrace it. Stick around past the initial credits for a surprise cameo from a well known Marvel villian named Thanos (if you don't know who he is--look him up. He appears in a number of Marvel comics at various times and his character IS tied to the Cosmic Cube so Whedon does a good job of combining elements of the first issue of \\"The Avengers\\" with later comics).<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of assembling the Avengers (pun intended) for their first big screen adventure. The film is filled with strong action sequences that are both well designed and executed. The continuity between \\"The Avengers\\" and the previous Marvel films (\\"Captain America\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", \\"Iron Man 2\\" and \\"Thor\\")is well established and continued here (it helps that Whedon did an uncredited rewrite on \\"Captain America\\" and even worked on Ang Lee's much disliked \\"Hulk\\" plus Whedon is a passionate fan of the Marvel comic books).<br /><br />Are there flaws? Well, sure just about every movie has one flaw or another. There are some plot coincidences, holes that will bother those who are picky about that stuff but what matters here (at least to me...your mileage may vary)is the flow and how well put together the story is.

B002KT3XH6|5.0|Alison Weir is respected when it comes to Tudor history, and this book shows why - it is a full and detailed account of Henry VIII 6 wifes. It covers from Catherine bethrodal with Arthur, Prince of Wales, up to Thomas Seymour persuit of marrying Elizabeth in the aftermath of Catherine Parr's death.<br /><br />Although the content is similar to that of Antonia Frasier's book of the same name, they are very different in style and conclusions. It also sometimes parts with Alison's other books, specially those who were written after it (on this book she is sure that Henry condemned Anne Boleyn, on her latter work, The Lady in the Tower, she  advocates that it doesn't seem to be the case). I found Frasier's better organized, but Weir's much better when it comes to facts and trivia, without Frasier's judging remarks.<br /><br />It's well worth a reading, and a must have for any Tudor fan.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is awesome! I love it. How could some think of such a smart idea for a game. It is amazing!
0385523912|5.0|Barbara Demick tells about life in this dystopian reality through the lives of 6 North Korean defectors.  The first 200 pages are so real they are almost unbearable.  I lost count of how many people in the families of these six died of starvation, while the survivor helplessly tried to do something about it.<br /><br />People work long hours, demonstrate loyalty to their leader and attend political education classes. There is no \\"free time\\", but there is nothing to do with it anyway.  The world is shut out so entirely, that they think there is \\"nothing to envy\\" in the outside world.  The famine of the 1990's came without headlines, but people could see their country and their lives slipping away. Factories shut down for want of energy.  Even those with \\"good jobs\\" had wages cut and rations cut; some worked for no pay.  In the 1980's, Dr. Kim and her colleagues scavenged the countryside for herbs to make drugs for their patients; in the 1990's they scavenged the countryside for weeds for their own meals.<br /><br />Through these six defectors, we also follow the trends within this closed country.  In the 1990's the citizens, at least, went through the motions of devotion to their country and leader.  Today, there are cracks, but the police state with its draconian consequences remains in place.<br /><br />While I was engrossed in these stories, it was a heavy dose of sadness.  I was glad to come to the last third of the book where they escape to freedom.  There are many ways to do this, and each story is different.  The integration process provided by the South Korean government appears to be a good solid program, but adjusting to this new world, with the weight of the past must be very difficult.  Relatives and acquaintances can suffer for their actions, and this can weigh heavily on them.<br /><br />This is an excellent book. I highly recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down! Loved it! The book is very different from anything I have ever read before but I was on the edge of my seat and still am! Now reading the second. Definitely a must read!
B005ONTD42|3.0|I'm a tech guy and purchased this as a unique desk toy to have in the office. I've had many people look at it and think it's pretty cool to run. I have a large open space that I can \\"drive\\" it around and use the Sphero draw app to draw predefined paths. My only complaint is that it's hard to get it to connect via BlueTooth. I paired it and connected the first time and had a lot of fun with it but the last couple times a coworker has asked to see it run I couldn't get it to connect. It still shows as paired with my phone (HTC Rezound) but the applications fail to connect and keep displaying RETRY despite the fact it's sitting 6\\" from my phone and is cycling it's colors waiting to connect. Seems to connect like once in 10 tries or so. Maybe too many BlueTooth devices in my area that it's getting confused. Hmmm..
B005OKTPKC|4.0|This book ilustrates you how easy ys to get trapped in a corporative mesh of a lawyer's firm.<br />The extreme situation is depicted in a easy going three lawerr' firm. Where anything can happen. It is fun, intriguing and full of humanism.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good to learn chess with.  Wish the pieces captured would be shown. My son has had draws with Grandmasters, this is not up to that level of competition....neither am I.  So far I like it.  Thank you for your efforts!<br />m.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I started Hunger Games twice but could not get past the first third of the book because I found it too disturbing.  We went to see it at the theater and I finished the Trilogy in a week.<br /><br />The movie is rated Pg 13.  As a parent, I would check that rating out before I sent my kids to see it.  It's  an exceptionally well  done movie but the focal concept of the movie is disturbing, even for an adult.<br /><br />The Trilogy is an an exceptional set of books.  The story sticks to it's central themes and presents those themes from many perspectives.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Game of Thrones\\",<br /> which I loved Book 1 to 3 but hated books 4 to 5 and  will probably be dead before book 6 and 7 finally are released, \\"Hunger  Games\\" delivered the entire Trilogy quickly and with great style, great characters.  The author is consistent in time, place and attitudes of diverse peoples and places.  She is unflinching in her storytelling...no one is entirely nice or right or wrong, appealing or unappealing.  I was very captivated by her ability to envision future cultures, future geopolitical circumstances with a non judgemental, viewpoint.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a great story,  well told, well written and well thought out.  This  is my first 5 star review and I am really cheap with the stars.<br /><br />Sheridan, Il, USA
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love it. Great app.you can find anything you need on ebay. its a must have app. always a good experience.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed the Omnibus thoroughly from start to finish and have recommended it to many friends who enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction. It's a great take on the genre - focused much more on the human condition, societies and the details within than many other books. Even better, I discovered a new favorite author, and have since picked up [[ASIN:B002CMLE04 Molly Fyde and the Parsona Rescue (The Bern Saga Book 1)]].
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been looking for this app/game since.... forever!!!! I love this game!!!! u should totally get this!!! now can we have temple run for free?!?!?!?!?!?!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|tons of fun games. great to have while traveling. anyone can play. all ages welcome to enjoy these games anytime.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided to read this excerpt, despite the fact that it was (and not is) written in first person-present tense, a way of writing invented for usage when describing dreams - something this authoress wasn't aware of.<br />I saw it was on the NYT best seller list, which for me is no recommendation.<br />It was also at the top of Amazon's best seller list, which should be the - `FIRST PERSON-PRESENT TENSE STORY LIST', well, enough said.<br />So, I started reading, and after a while I had the impression that the character, a rather gormless-sounding female, full of `why me' pity most of the time, was the authoress's alter ego, somebody who thinks she has produced `the excellence in writing' and somebody who is easily confused by BLOND vs. BLONDE.<br />So, we all know what the word `best seller' means - NOTHING.<br />I could have read the entire book if I had been foolish enough to buy it, luckily I had the opportunity to `Look inside' and didn't. Reader beware of best seller lists.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Sometimes I don't play it.But when I do play it another box comes on. Plus I don't even update it!!It updates by itself!!!AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|A great set of films, by an intelligent, articulate director. And the product arrived as advertised, and earlier than expected.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game has given me fun hours of peaceful play with brain traders along the way. It is clear; not all that jumbled up mess you have with some of the other games.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game. I haven't been playing it for that long but so far so good. Keep up the good work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|For my 13th birthdayI received a kindle fire and I am still loading it up with apps and games. I just happened to come upon this one. This game is very fun. It comes with racing, action, and arcade games that vary from Seranade, where you have to catch the roses from fans and avoid other objects from nasty people in the audience, to a racing game where you guide the car with your finger. You start off with 10 or so games and have to play those games to earn points which you use to get more games. There is no &quot;buy full version to unlock the rest&quot; because this is the full version. I definitely recommend this game. The reason for the 4 stars is that this game has to direct you to an add after every game you play. Its kind of annoying but nothing that would stop me from getting the app.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|My daughter loved the movie, so when I found this, I knew I had the perfect gift for her!  She keeps it in her car CD player constantly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book intriged me after the first paragraph. It captured my imagination and made me consider my own fantasies.  Hence the reason all 3 books are on the NYT's best seller list. Today's woman spends her life running full speed ahead, job, home, family, shuttle service, parents, all require her undivided attention..at the same time. We command our lives in the same matter we command a business meeting.  We schedule every minute down to how long we have to brush our teeth.  Yet this equation is always missing a very important element - our need for romance. We fail to include the person who is always in charge and we fail to let someone else take charge. In doing this we miss out on what could make us happiest. This book, gives us what we'd all like, someone to take care of us, someone else to worry about us, someone to pamper us, someone who not only listens to what we say, but actually hears us and responds.<br /><br />I have recommend the series to my book club and several other friends.  They have all had the same reaction, they could put the books down.  They also had the same question: \\"Where do I find Christian?\\"<br /><br />Happy reading..
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I was amazed by Streep's portrayal of the late Lady Thatcher. A wonderful women and leader during a time when the world needed them. Along with partner Ronald Reagan, Thatcher helped in ending of the Cold War and keeping socialism away. The film made me more empathetic to her struggle with dementia, and wanting to learn more about her leadership practice. Her struggle to leave No. 10 Downing Street was quite obvious as she and late husband Denis (although dead- but still alive in her mind) are going back to remembering achievements- Her election in May 1979, the Falkland Islands War (1982), the Cutting back on Spending so that the UK would not go bankrupt and above all, her unwillingness to not back down- \\"The Lady's Not for turning\\".<br />The film is an interesting look at her life from a different perspective, but by no means negative.<br /><br />Those who did not like the movie- well, sorry. Go and watch one of the many BBC Documentary Margaret Thatcher pics.
0345803485|5.0|I Looved this book!?Is it the best writing ever? No! Is it my favorite book? No!But it is def worth a read.If you do not like S&M I would not read it because it is very graphic! I have read several reviews on here and that is why I did not buy to begin with but then my cousin read it so I thought I would give it a try and glad I did!! It's about a girl named Ana who interviews Christian Grey for a newspaper article because her best friend Kate is sick.<br /><br />She starts to fall for him but when she realizes what he is and what he wants her to do, that's when it gets crazy. Can she be what he wants her to be? Can her give her more? He trys. You really need to read it. It's a good book. I would not reccomend anyone reading this under 18, it has ALOT OF SEX! Hope you will give it a chance! :)
1594744769|1.0|...How anyone liked this book. There's a MAJOR grammar mistake in the first chapter (desert vs dessert)and the actual story isn't remotely close to the premise being advertised.<br /><br />I was super excited to read the book as I wanted to read a good supernatural thriller. I also liked the idea of the pictures. What I got was poorly written first person prose and a story that drags in a pathetic attempt at racking up a sequel. This is a science fiction story about time travel and children with mutant powers. Had the book been advertised as that I wouldn't have felt so jipped.<br /><br />It makes me wonder if all the five star reviews are just trolls or if the author asked his friends to do it. Save your time and money on this book as there will likely be a film adaptation in the works. There always is.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Interesting read. Biggest realization was that Jobs was just a man with his own unique faults but a genius in many  ways. I would recommend it as a book worth sparing some time to read.
B00756GKBA|2.0|What happened to the poetic Madonna from Ray of Light and the fun of Confessions? I know she can do better. Most of the songs are so simple and the lyrics are predictable. Did she write this in one day? I LOVE Madonna and this is why I am being so hard on her. I expected more from such a talent. 53 years old and curse words are still funny and cute? Really? It's not cool anymore to hear and old lady drop the F bomb and use her middle finger. Grow up Madonna. Come on, you are better than this. Girl Gone Wild is great. I'm Addicted is another good one. Skip the slow songs and the demented Gang Bang. Someone needs therapy. Beautiful Killer? Isn't this Beautiful Stranger? I\\"m A Sinner is a favorite. Oh Mickey you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. LUV Madonna!
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Really wanted this product to work  and gave it tons of tries, but it simply doesn't work!! I thought we bought a faulty one. Returned it, set up a new one, and gave it another shot only to find the same results. It worked properly for the first two days and then comes the endless buffering!! No way to call the company for customer support and slow e-mail response time!! Cant take the risk with our baby!! Ends up being a $300 paper weight!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app! I love solitaire so I had to get this one and its free so you cant beat that lol. I see people complaining about the ads but they aren't that bad, you can. skip all of them. its not like you have to wait and watch a 30 second ad after each game lol.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just could not put this book down and downloaded the second and third books. Excellent reading!! I have recommended these books to others. So descriptive you feel that you too are in the arena with Katniss.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|This movie although very slow as far as action is concerned, has very goo information. Its depiction of real life is extraordinary, especially the way the people react to each other and the government entities that were sent to \\"help\\" in bad times. This movie will definitely make you think about the possibility of a global pandemic and what you can do to help yourself, your friends, and your family survive a possible outbreak.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to see the movie before reading the book.  I finished the book in 2 days, bought the second book, and then had to read the third to finish the story.  Now I've seen the movie.  So glad to have followed that order.  The books made the movie mean so much more, and the movie put a fine focus on the book.  Don't miss any of them.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read it in 2 days. A nice easy read. I did not want to put it down. An easy escape for the mind.
B007PS0X0W|4.0|The movie kept developing as it progressed. The action scenes were very good. Yeah, you can figure somethings out along the way, but you still will want more when the movie ends. Thats really why it stood out to me. Movie went by fast.
0345803485|3.0|I have read most of the reviews, and can't say one way or the other yet how this book is. (Going to borrow it to check it out, not gonna spend money if it's crap.)<br /><br />But I do want to say for anyone REALLY looking for an absolutely fantastic BDSM series, look into Laura Antoniou's \\"Marketplace\\".<br /><br />Having expressed an interest in this genre I was directed towards it and can say honestly it was amazing. There are a couple of characters that made me want to pull out my hair, but not because of poor writing. The characters were simply examples of real people trying to break into the genre for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I'll say it again, if you are looking for a (not completely realistic, but close enough) truly amazing BDSM *fiction, Laura Antoniou is the best start.<br /><br />Just doing my part to help. :)<br /><br />**Update - May 26, 2012<br /><br />I have now read the book.<br />Overall It was not a bad read, and not nearly as bad as many reviews led me to believe. But this is NOT A BDSM novel (in my opinion). This is just an \\"Erotic Romance\\" between two people who happen to be trying to find a middle ground between one's BDSM tastes and the others inexperience (ie. \\"vanilla\\") preferences.<br /><br />There were a few instances of annoyance, many due to the main character's ignorance and both the Leads lack of communication skills, but what can you do? There are many people with the same \\"flaws\\", so I let it slide.<br /><br />However, I am surprised at the \\"writing style\\". Some parts were so very well written and then others.... needed work. Felt like a draft, not something that should have been published yet. A bit more polish and revision would have done wonders for this book. Especially could have done without the many pages of the \\"contract\\" and the heroine's use of the word's \\"down there\\" (huge turn-off), but again I think this has to do with the immaturity of the writing.<br /><br />I am still not disappointed and do not feel that reading this was a \\"waste of time\\". I did very much enjoy the witty banter between characters and the heroine's inner workings (ie. subconscious self). I will continue on to the next books because I am the type of person who needs to know how everything ends.<br /><br />I will recommend this book to people with open minds and good amount of patience. Do NOT expect realism, rational thought or Pulitzer prize writing.<br /><br />Just a story. :)<br /><br />p.s. still proudly stand by my previous recommendation of Laura Antoniou's \\"Marketplace\\" series as my #1 Favorite BDSM series of all time.  ;)
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I don't think there has been a movie starring Meryl Steep that I haven't loved, until now.  Don't get me wrong, she was phenomenal in The Iron Lady, but it was the movie itself which as the problem.<br /><br />Margaret Thatcher was an extremely private person, yet about 75% of the movie deals with Margaret Thatcher's later years of life as she adjusts to life without her husband, and her deteriorating mental health.<br /><br />I guess I was looking forward to getting more insight into her time in politics as Prime Minister. Unfortunately the focus of her time as Prime Minister was not covered in any kind of depth. The acting was wonderful, but the movie itself left me a bit disappointed.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|Was working fine until the most recent update i think. now all it does is force close, it even crashed my phone once, such an entertaining game before all the crashing of the app. hope it gets fix. am using a samsung infuse with zeus rom.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing Oregon Trails on my computer when I was a child.  When I saw this game as a free download I couldn't resist.  So far I am really enjoying expanding my town and building it.  Its kind of a mix of the Oregon Trails story line that I remember mixed with Sim City.  I can't wait to see how my town turns out.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|While I'm looking forward to The Dark Knight Rises more than any other film this year, The Avengers was a complete blast. They combined elements from the different Marvel movies and made a complete story out of it. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the Hulk all get their moments to shine. You get your Iron Man vs. Thor and Hulk vs. Thor fights. That's just a taste of what is to come during the last thirty minutes of pure destruction. The CGI is top of the line and the action scenes are really great, but the movie never forgets that a good story and solid laughs are just as important as all the pretty explosions. The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (full of snappy dialogue) is as good as it gets. The Hulk is finally done right. Not too big and just the right amount of scary. Funny that he gets the two biggest laughs in the movie. I even thought that the character Loki was a much better and more menacing villain here than in Thor. It's not perfect, but I think it is the best Marvel film to date.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B000ME5B30|5.0|Al Gore is phenomenal in this documentary. I expected to be bored but I was captivated. Al Gore speaks with intelligence, passion and humor. He has facts to back up all of his well articulated facts. I fail to see how anyone can deny that global warming is a serious problem after watching this. We can and must take actions now to save the environment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very close to the word read. I like how it gets black and the words white so it'd not so loud with the bright lite when you are in a dark auditorium. this really nice!
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|They should have never put Michael Douglas in the listing. He may be made 3 cameo appearances-seems they added him to get people to watch. This movie is not worth seeing. It is so UNDER budget, just running threw the city streets fighting. There really is no plot, if you can figure out what was going on by the end of the movie you are lucky. This was almost as bad as a documentary. Hardly any talking just old time orchestra music threw the entire thing.<br /> I wish there was a  minus star rating.  Bad, Bad, Bad<br /><br />Oh so boring !!!!
B005HSL626|4.0|awesome game I love it except it froze up or it wouldn't let me on the app only the free one freezes up
1881273873|5.0|I loved reading this book. I wanted to read the Single's Edition since it has some different things from the original book. It talks about the stages of romantic love, and also how the love languages relate to co-workers, parents, room-mates, and of course: Dating. All the examples and stories in the book are from real singles Gary Chapman has talked to. They were very helpful for understanding situations and people, and how to apply the different love languages. I feel like I have learned a lot. There are questions at the end of each chapter to get you thinking and to help you improve. The book was easy to read and enjoyable. I looked forward to what each chapter had to say. This book, like the original one, has a test to help you find your own love language.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Amazon sent me a revision 1 motherboard.  Out of the box, with the version F5 firmware, it supported the [[ASIN:B005UBNLFK AMD FX-8150]] processor and [[ASIN:B002T3JN0Y unbuffered DDR3 PC-1333 ECC memory]].  Flashing the BIOS to version F6 using a USB stick was easy.<br /><br />Some of the good things about the Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 are:<br /><br />* Classic non-UEFI BIOS.<br />* IOMMU and full virtualization support.<br />* Fast POST. Less than 5 seconds from power on to system start.<br />* Unbuffered ECC memory support, including chipkill and scrubbing features.<br />* Gigabyte has RSS feeds for firmware and software updates.<br /><br />The only noticeably bad things about the GA-990FXA-UD3 are its default BIOS options.  Settings for AHCI, the IOMMU, and turbo core clocking are all disabled by default.  Enable these features to get maximum performance.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've had the Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 for a few months and I'm subtracting one star because the firmware is flakey and has slow or incorrect default BIOS options for everything that matters.  For example, this motherboard has problems booting from an off-board PCEe card, and it sometimes forgets its boot order if you push the reset button.  Just make sure that the primary boot device is on port 0 of the onboard SATA controller.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't usually read Fiction works but The Hunger Games was very riveting and full of descriptive detail. It was as if I was apart of the book. This is a must read. Immediately after finishing the book I ran to the theaters to see the movie. The movie was good but the book is far better. After seeing the movie I ran home and purchased the second book on my Kindle for iPad. Can't wait to get into the second book. This is an awesome book and has restored my interest in Fiction works.
0393080269|5.0|this book is very easy to understand even for non-english speakers and non-economics major graduate. it will help you think 3 times before putting your money in the hot markets that you might not know the hind side.
B004FOA84A|4.0|though short, this game is good for a boring Sunday afternoon. the graphics are good and some of the puzzles are pretty clever. I wasn't too fond of the storyline as a whole, but the journey to get there was pretty decent.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. To those of you that are have trouble with closing tap menu in the bottom right corner then tap options the home bar should show up after you bring up the options menu. Then u can either tap the house on the left side or the back arrow. If u push the back arrow the game will ask u if you are sure you want to exit. This game is an very enjoyable game...
1932100660|5.0|Most important book ever written.  This should be rquired reading for anyone interested in good health and nutrition.  This should be used in all the schools to teach young people the importance of eating a healthy diet.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love all virtual city games.  I can play for hours or days and still have many more levels to complete.  Once you do finish you can start over and have just as much fun as the first time because there are so many levels.  Love all games from G5.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|As I lay in bed near midnight last night eagerly devouring this tale and coming close to the conclusion, I suddenly realised that there were tears running down my cheeks. Rarely am I moved to such emotion by a story and despite, perhaps in the manner of the movie of Tolkien's 'The Return of the King', one too many endings, I thoroughly enjoyed Rachel Joyce's telling of Harold Fry's inner and outer journeys.
B005K17RU0|1.0|AccuWeather app keeps locking up on the Kindle Fire. It runs through the radar once or twice then stops. I have to do a power button reset in order to get the Fire to work again. It's done this several times. I finally deleted it.
1609983238|4.0|I listened to this story as an audiobook, narrated by Hauro Hantman, so my review is based on that version.<br /><br />This book was originally written in 1953 and I have really started taking a liking to these old mystery novels.  It is not the same as a novel written today in where the setting is in the 1950s, but an actual novel written during that timeframe thinks nothing of mentioning smoking in college classrooms, the jukebox on the table at your favorite coffee shop, or the folded handkerchief that gentleman would offer ladies who were crying.  You just gotta love those little details.<br /><br />This story was clever masterpiece of mystery and suspense.  Our young protagonist is a gentleman determined to make it big by marrying big.  He tries to find young ladies who are daughters of wealthy families to date.  He woos them carefully, so if the relationship doesn't work out, he can move on without alerting other young ladies that he is dating girls for their potential to make him rich.  He thinks he has found the perfect girl in Dorothy.<br /><br />All is going well until Dorothy turns up pregnant.  Then he sees all of his carefully laid plans start to go down the drain.  He can't just dump her, that wouldn't look good.  He can't marry her because her father would disown her because of the unplanned pregnancy.  Then he wouldn't get any money and they would have to live in poverty.  But if she were to suffer an `accident' then he would be off the hook and could continue dating again.<br />Now it seems like he has gotten away with the perfect crime ... or has he?  One of Dorothy's sisters gets involved and starts asking questions and he begins to feel threatened by her discoveries. If she finds out too much, he might go to jail and never get rich.  Maybe she should have an `accident' too before she discovers too much.<br /><br />Overall this was a great little mystery / suspense  story.  Even though you know who killed Dorothy there were many, many more twists and turns in this book.  Enough to keep you going full speed ahead until you see the light.  It was a very satisfying read.<br /><br />The Narration Review<br />This audiobook was narrated by Hauro Hantman. He has a nice, clear, and soft spoken voice.  He was very easy to listen to and he had a calming effect.  Definitely a voice you can listen to while relaxing.  There were a few times in the story where the juke box was playing and instead of just reading the lyrics, Hauro sang the tunes.  I discovered that Hauro has a very pleasant singing voice, too!and turns in this book.  Enough to keep you going full speed ahead until you see the light.  It was a very satisfying read.<br /><br />The Narration Review<br />This audiobook was narrated by Hauro Hantman. He has a nice, clear, and soft spoken voice.

There were a few times in the story where the juke box was playing and instead of just reading the lyrics, Hauro sang the tunes.  I discovered that Hauro has a very pleasant singing voice, too!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|This was awesome, John!  A friend of mine suggested I read your book.  It inspired me to take control of my books and move forward! I am now with Amazon and couldn't be happier.  With 3-more books in the works it was the best move I could have made.<br />Thanks,John, for the motivation!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! ! Can't stop playing it!! Well worth 99 cents. Buy it if you want a challenge.
B005LAIGLO|1.0|The movie itself is (arguably) fine; the main problem with this product is the blu ray formatting itself. If you pause the movie long enough for it to go the \\"Universal\\" screen, it will never start again. It freezes at the point of resumption, and will not play. Similarly, if you eject the movie, re-insert, and try to select the scene you were watching, it freezes on that scene and will not play.<br /><br />I fail to see how the Blu-Ray industry can keep shoving the \\"Blu Ray is so awesome\\" speech down our throats, when I have YET to see a single blu ray that will play from start to finish without pausing for several seconds at some point in the middle of the movie to \\"catch up with itself\\". DVD never did that. And DVD on a blu ray player looks great! All the industry needed to do was make a better dvd player, not an inferior new movie format.<br /><br />This blu ray needs to be recalled until the formatting bugs are worked out!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Excellent product, plenty of room for all my stuff. Built strong, which is good. I'll be using this product alot...
B002WY65VU|4.0|The movie is awesome (not a huge zombie movie person in general but LOVED this one) and it got to me sooner than expected.  Overall, one happy camper, just be sure to follow the rules!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I really like this phone cover it's very nice no fuss. I'd buy another one in a heart beat. Period.
B0061S073A|5.0|I tell everyone about this app. I know my kids are safe and can't get into anything other than what I selected.  I highly recommend this app!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend.  I am so glad that I did.  This is truly a fresh breath of air in the fantasy scene.  I found the book very well written and believable.  This story sucked me in and kept me turning pages.  It has been a while since I picked up a book that made me sit down and read the entire book in one afternoon.<br /><br />I can't wait until I get a chance to read the next story in the series and follow the story of Sophia and Charles.
B005HSL626|3.0|I like the app but when I'm some where there is no Internet I cant play it. that's why I only gave it 3 stars.
B0055MBQOM|1.0|I used this device on 4 laptops and two external monitors connected to two of the laptops.  On three of the laptops, and the two external monitors, it produced a consistent brown cast.  I cant imagine it's accurate.  The monitors look horrible after calibration.  On the other laptop (the only glossy screen of the bunch), it produced a severe yellow cast.  All of the laptops have dedicated Nvidia graphic cards (two of them are high end Quadro cards for AutoCAD use).  The laptop that produced the yellow cast has a high end Nvidia gaming card.<br /><br />I tried multiple settings, re-ran the calibration program multiple times, and the results were always the same.  I contacted Xrite technical support and initially received a quick response indicating that my problem stemmed from trying to use the Nvidia control panel to adjust the monitors despite my assertion that I had the Nvidia setting set to \\"allow other applications to control color settings.\\"  Subsequent emails to technical support went unanswered.<br /><br />I would not recommend the ColorMunki Display for laptop systems or laptops with external monitors attached.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm clock is great .. I was wasn't. sure I was going to like it at first that it wasn't. going to be loud. enough but it is a lot of people. are saying that. it drains. your battery but I keep my kindle plugged in at night so I don't have to worry about that.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun but can get boring when you have to get more points to open more games great to pass the time.
0345803485|5.0|I normally do not go to the romance type books, I bought this book because of all the talk about the book.  I am hooked!!  I did not want to put the book down!  I finished the book and I so wish I had the others to finish the reading.  I am dying to read on.  I live very rural so going out to a store to buy the books is not an option.  I did order the other 2 to finish off this trilogy.  I sure hope they get here fast!!  The book is not as raw and raunchy as people have said, there are things on TV that are worse.  James makes you want more.  Glad I got the book and like I mentioned the other 2 better hurry.
B007U8UBGI|1.0|After hearing this album the idea that Jack White was going to become a legend, or even remain relatively interesting, seems all but dead.<br /><br />Of course, he's always had some inexplicability embarrassingly moments. He is a restless and creative artist after all. He explores as an artist should. Certainly, no one expects every utterance to be a all time classic. But, who knew that he would make a whole album this uneventful - predictable - and frankly boring.<br /><br />And in those rare moments when it's not boring, it actually bad. He tries so hard to please everyone that it's actually uncomfortable to listen to. (Look mom, no hands. Am I not entertaining?) But to be honest, that's not too much of a problem. It's mostly not interesting enough to be bad - it's just there - clunky and boring.<br /><br />I really never saw that coming from someone like Jack White.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, as it is told from the perspective of two women from different generations in war-torn Afghanistan.  The book reads as a historical and yet relevant to modern-day story of what life was/is like for young girls as they are forced to quickly become women in a patriarchal society.  More books like these need to be written as these stories provide profound insight into the realities of what women endure as they struggle to overcome religious, political, and historical ideologies that women should not be seen or heard.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great way to pass by time and ignore the kids, not to mention great for work. hurry and download before it charges....

B005CGI4EG|5.0|I payed 32 bucks (including shipping) for this brand new, complete DVD series of the 11 year run of Married w/Children, and it was delivered the same week.  Great deal!  Highly recommended seller.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|Except for the shipping(took 4 weeks) I can say I really like this CD.  I'm going to see them in July, so needed to learn their new songs.  Some are a bit heavier than their old stuff, but all-in-all, you can't go wrong with Chad Kroeger & Co.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I purchased this book first in large print soft cover edition at Walmart, finished it and loved it! Since I love the series so much, I bought Mockingjay,Catching Fire and going to buy The Hunger Games! Suzanne Collins is the best selling author for a reason I can tell you that! Buy this book!
B007V5CF5K|3.0|Seems like it could be fun.  I can't tell because I'm stuck on the first level.  When I try to dial the chief's number the pop up disappears after I dial the first number.  I've dialing all #'s anyway,  but nothing works.  Otherwise,  I. would give a higher rating.  Anyone have a solution?
B007CKNX28|5.0|Absolutely incredible!! One of those very few PERFECT CDs !! Cannot wait for his tour to get to Los Angeles...know it will sell out within minutes!
0307959856|4.0|While I have to agree with many of the other reviewers about the fact that the book crosses over genres, I rather liked it. I appreciate both the classics and murder mysteries and I thought it was fun to combine the two. I thought the writing, while not at Jane Austen's level (really, who is?), was very good, consistent, clear, and of the correct time period in delivery and syntax. The book moved at a consistent pace and I felt the mystery was good and the resolution of the mystery was excellent. It seemed that there was something else going on throughout the book, although I did not realize how deep it ran or how complicated.<br /><br />The reason I couldn't give this 5 stars may seem (to some) a little nit-picky on my part but here goes: the crossing of Jane Austen's books irritated me. The reference in the beginning to Sir Walter Elliot and his family from Jane Austen's Persuasion, and then at the end to Mrs. Knightley and Mrs. Martin from Emma made me crazy. I thought it was a poor attempt at levity and while I'm guessing it was supposed to make the reader feel like there is an inside joke to which we are privy, it just made me cringe.<br /><br />Other than that oversight, I think if you enjoy Jane Austen and a murder mystery and can suspend disbelief and judgment about how it's not really either one but both, you will probably enjoy this book.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|It was a stronger movie than the 1st of it's kind. It was a lot less campy. I really enjoyed it b/c I went in not expecting much.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fastest solitaire I have ever played.  Touch screen on the kindle fire makes plays almost as fast as you can think.  Ads are small and not obtrusive.  And its free!  What do you have to lose?
B0064BWE8U|2.0|The story line itself is very lame, hard to engage with such a weak premise.<br /><br />The really annoying thing though is that the whole book is full of foot notes which are very irritating to read in kindle form as you are constantly clicking forward and back. It is not always easy to click on the notes either, which caused me a lot of frustration and made my reading of this book disjointed.<br /><br />Perhaps it would be easier to read in paperback format.
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|Didn't expect this type of movie.  My husband was completely bored.<br />It was a hard movie to follow and not fall asleep.
B000000H40|5.0|Trust me you wont be disappointed. Obituary's second album ,Cause of Death, is one of the most important death metal releases of the 1990's and of all time. Ive seen a lot of early death metal bands praise Obituary for their brutality. They had such a impact on the genre that you just cant miss out on buying this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but some games aren't to fun. over all its good. there are some really fun games though. hgghhj

0439023491|5.0|This second book could have gone in many different directions.  I expected something formulaic but was caught off guard by the plot.  At first I was annoyed by the turn of events, but quickly got into the action, helped by the author's talent for quick paced and exciting story-telling.  After reading The Hunger Games, I should have realized Suzanne Collins would not bore me.  I didn't feel this was a place-holder for the conclusion to come in Mockingjay as some have described it.  It stands on it's own quite well for me.  Having finished it, I can't quite imagine how Katniss's story could have evolved any better.  The suspense remains palpable and urges the reader to quickly pick up Mockingjay...a worthy acccomplishment for the author and an anticipated pleasure for the reader as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so cool to be able to carry the precious words of God with me anywhere:)  Thank you for creating this app!

B0073XORCY|5.0|the early 1970's the music world was introduced to \\"thick as a brick\\" (english slang for being really stupid or closed minded)<br />the effort was also a complete piece of music in a classical sense. Some called it a rock opera. Jethro Tull's main man and composer<br />created the character of a 10 year boy who wrote a poem titled \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and Jethro Tull put it to music.<br /><br />The package was designed to represent a news paper full of article surrounding the young boy and his writing the poem.<br /><br />The TAAB 2 (thick as a brick 2) looks at the boy as  a man 40 years or so later. Also a complete piece of music Tull looks at<br />what might have happened over the last 40 years of his life. TAAB2 is new and fresh Tull at their best. Using some of the old and intergrating it with the new. The cover art like the first album depicts a news paper with articles.<br />If you like Jethero Tull music then TABB2 is a must.

0446582778|2.0|I finally slogged through this thing and I only finished because I finish 98.5% of all the books I start.  It is full of chapter after chapter where absolutely nothing happens garnished with an ultimately meaningless  red herring or two.  The final explanation calls for such complex planning and execution with such precise detail that I would have preferred the author just say grey aliens beamed down and killed the two victims. It would have been easier to swallow. Early on the author has the LAPD Inspector General commit two felonies by destroying evidence in a murder case which Bosch quickly uncovers and still he sits still while she repeatedly gives him an ACLU approved lecture on the need to watch those dirty cops.  he doesn't just let her get away with this smug holier than thou attitude he seems to partially buy it.  Pitiful. I still like the Lincoln Lawyer series but I'm finished with trying to like the new improved Bosch.
0802473156|5.0|This book is really great, even at the time i ordered it i'm single, but it will help me in the future. `LOVE IT so much !

B00338QENI|5.0|This is an excellent read for all!  It is a historical review, yet of my own time.  It is of medical history and evolution in the fight against disease, and the most dreaded of all, cancer.  It tells of the contribution and difficult life of an american black woman and her family, and their fight for an ethical resolve.

But the movie was AWESOME !!<br />The cast was Brillant and it's worth the Money. You also get a digital Copy of the movie to put in you computer.  So don't pass this one up You'll Love IT!!
B006OKOZGU|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY REISSUE - FEATURES A LOWRY DIGITAL RESTORATION ***<br /><br />When 1955's \\"To Catch A Thief\\" was relaunched on DVD back in 2007 with a full frame-by-frame Lowry Digital Restoration (the company is now known as Reliance MediaWorks) - fans of the film were quietly blown away by the work done on the print. Like \\"North By Northwest\\" (that other great Hitchcock/Grant collaboration cleaned up by the same much-praised process) - \\"Catch\\" looked stupendous - beautifully clean vibrant colour - and it came with a nice slew of new complimentary extras.<br /><br />This 2012 BLU RAY reissue of it is no different - a truly gorgeous looking film finally given the format it deserves. In fact there are moments in this transfer that must surely rate as BLU RAY 'restoration benchmarks' - the clean up seeing Robert Burks' original colour cinematography shine like a diamond. Burks and his team (who had framed \\"Rear Window\\" for Hitch the year before) pulled an Oscar for their work on \\"To Catch A Thief\\" - and would go on to provide Hitchcock with the same filmic magic on \\"Vertigo\\" (1958), \\"North By Northwest\\" (1959), \\"The Birds\\" (1963) and \\"Marnie\\" (1964).<br /><br />\\"To Catch A Thief\\" is presently an American issue on BLU RAY (Paramount 14637) but it's due in the UK in July 2012. If you can't wait and want the US version - the good news is that it's NOT REGION-CODED so it'll play in all players. It comes in a card wrap sleeve (which the British issue won't) and features a full compliment of extras including a few new bits over the 2007 DVD issue (see list below).<br /><br />The film itself is the stuff of legend - a testament to clever scriptwriting, Director grit, meticulous planning and sheer leading man and woman starpower. Battling censorship groups and prudish bosses - Hitch used his brilliant scriptwriter JOHN MICHAEL HAYES to adapt David Dodge's book and construct a screenplay positively bristling with salacious suggestion. For this he needed sex - or more accurately - implied sex. So we get lines like \\"What you need is two weeks with a good man in Niagara Falls...\\" (a famous Honeymoon destination of the time where newlyweds rarely left their chalets) or Grace Kelly offering Cary Grant some chicken from the picnic basket \\"You want a leg or a breast?\\" Cary smirks and gives the perfect double-entendre reply. \\"You make the choice...\\"<br /><br />Even something as innocuous to us now as sunbathing on a sandy beach was fraught with moral degradation then. The powers-that-be feared bikinis - so Hitch had Grace wear a full bathing suit to get around their protestations. BUT when he came to shoot the scene, she sexily rubs in suntan oil into her elegant bare arms. You don't notice her passion-killer swimsuit much after that. Or even when they eventually kiss in the darkened bedroom towards the end - it cuts to fireworks in the background to suggest explosions of a more human kind. And yet precisely because both the writer and Hitch had to be so devious - the film is so much better for it. \\"To Catch A Thief\\" may be considered by some to be lightweight Hitchcock - but it's bloody entertaining fluff and was hugely racy for its time. Alfred Hitchcock knew that suggestion was more potent than showing - and his audience had a far more active imagination that any Committee of Impeccable Moral Turpitude.<br /><br />Hitchcock also loved his leading ladies - and few came more gobsmacking than Grace Kelly. Beautiful, sophisticated and (like her name) graceful in every way - she was the very epitome of Golden-Girl Fifties chic. What most hadn't expected however was that underneath all the glacial glamour lurked an out-an-out sexpot (she apparently devoured men in real life and of course married an actual Prince a year later). So combined with the legendary Hollywood costumer Edith Head - and the loaded lines - you got the gorgeous Grace Kelly both looking and sounding ravishing.<br /><br />Then of course came Hitchcock's other weapon of choice - the debonair Cary Grant. Cary plays John Robie - a retired jewel thief and burglar of 15-years affectionately known as \\"The Cat\\" because of his acts of agility when making house withdrawals. Someone who knows his methods starts robbing jewels from rich ladies elsewhere - and it isn't long before the finger of blame comes calling to Robie in his French retirement home in the hills. Robie must go to Cannes (where the robberies are) - and confront some of his old 'Resistance' mates (even if some of them want him dead) - a thief sent 'to catch a thief'. And on the story goes...<br /><br />Grant was 50 in 1954 and almost in semi-retirement - feeling that his public no longer wanted him - while Kelly (who was just 25) had worked with Hitchcock on \\"Dial M For Murder\\" and \\"Rear Window\\" in the previous year and become Hitch's new go-to girl. Hitch was keen to ally this rising female star with a suitable male match and game material that would enhance both - and after a persuasive dinner - he got Cary on board. And it worked a treat. Despite his advanced years and her youth - they seemed like Tracy and Hepburn - Bogey and Bacall - a completely believable couple. The film was a huge hit with the public (and still is) - largely due to the great script and their explosive onscreen chemistry...<br /><br />Jessie Royce Landis provided much of the comedy as the meddling mother and the gamine French actress Brigitte Auber played the other possible love interest - the young wilful Danielle with a soft spot for the suave John Robie. Solid dependable accomplice was played by John Williams - a Lloyds of London Insurance agent willing to give Robie what information he needs - if it means he can get his clients stolen jewels back. And all of it leads to a rooftop finale in the dark with a clever twist in its rather elegant tail...<br /><br />BLU RAY highlights include the market and flowers sequence - Kelly walking through the Hotel corridors in knockout off the shoulder dresses - Grant in the water by the pontoon - Robie trying to explain his innocence to the Chief of Police (Charles Varnell couldn't speak good English so you will notice that his entire performance is overdubbed) - and many more. Even the opening sequence that focuses on the window of a travel agent is gorgeous.<br /><br />To sum up - if you're a fan and your soft machine flutters at the thought of \\"To Catch A Thief\\" and its delicious naughtiness - then you must own it on BLU RAY.<br /><br />As Elin said on the 18th fairway to her faithful husband - is that a Redwood in your trousers Tiger - or are you just pleased to see me.

0439023483|2.0|I will begin by saying that I don't agree with the people who think that this book's material is too graphic or disturbing for teens. Yes, the concept itself is disturbing. Yes, The Hunger Games contains some moderately graphic violence. The fact of the matter is that books that lull you into a sense of complacency don't make an impact on anyone. I can really only speak for myself, but at thirteen years old I definitely wouldn't have lost any sleep over this story.<br /><br />At eighteen years old, I'm wondering why I wasted my time. The Hunger Games isn't the WORST book I've ever read, but the hype strikes me as rather bizarre. I feel as though the Emperor is naked, so to speak.<br /><br />As I began to read, the first thing that struck me was how very dull and stilted Katniss's narrative voice is. The writing, while certainly not the trainwreck that was Twilight, is cliched, trite, and shallow, a chop suey of the ideas of more talented writers at best. The prose does its job but nothing special can be said of it. I understand that Katniss, coming from a poor district, isn't likely to be the most eloquent girl, but Suzanne Collins might've done better to write this in third person.<br /><br />Katniss herself is another huge problem. There is absolutely nothing interesting about her, no particularly special quality about her that makes me actually care about her as a person. So she is resourceful and can hunt. So she has a temper. You could say the same of a wild chimpanzee. I suspect her relationship with her little sister Primrose was meant to accomplish the goal of making her into a sympathetic character, but all it did was convince me that Mrs. Collins has never had a sibling. Just for the record, I have an older sister who would've been about Katniss's age when I was Prim's. We are very close, more so than most siblings I've met, and we're still nothing like the sickeningly sweet display that apparently was supposed to inspire sympathy. The protagonist's relationships with other major characters aren't any improvement; I read every last page and I still don't understand Peeta's borderline-suicidal devotion to a girl with all the personality of a wet piece of tissue.<br /><br />Out of common decency I won't spoil the plot, but quite honestly, I don't need to. Deus ex machinas abound; every time it seems like Katniss is about to be faced with a weighty moral dilemma, along comes an entirely expected plot \\"twist\\" to conveniently remove that responsibility from her. For supposedly being about a brutal fight to the death, the book sure does pussyfoot around when it comes to inflicting any psychological anguish upon the protagonist. The mentality here is a very black-and-white one: poor good, rich bad, government worse. The violent and quick-paced action itself is quite honestly the only thing that makes The Hunger Games remotely tolerable. It's been said before but I'll say it again: this is basically Battle Royale for sissies.<br /><br />I give this book two stars because it fulfills the minimum requirement of being entertaining. It'd be difficult, after all, to make a story about children murdering each other BORING. But those of you who are looking for immersion and for characters who truly tug at your heartstrings, look elsewhere. The Hunger Games will leave you hungry, and not for more of Suzanne Collins' work.
B0015DWJ8W|4.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION<br /><br />BOOK DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Written over the course of several months in 2005 as Murakami prepared for the New York City Marathon, this memoir is about more than just running--though it is most certainly about the mindset of a long-distance runner and the type of commitment and life a dedicated runner leads. The book is just as much about aging, being a novelist and Murakami himself. Providing an insight into the kind of person Murakami is while also sharing his particular worldview, this memoir is a must-read for his fans and runners alike.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />After being unjustly accused of stealing this book from my brother, I downloaded the audio version from Audible, and I'm actually glad I did. I listened to it while walking my dog, and it was a perfect fit. The memoir unfolds in a meandering, stream of consciousness way that was fulfilling and gave me much food for thought as I walked. Listening to it while outside and active seemed like the ideal way to fully appreciate the book--giving me a view into the experience of running as I simulated it on a much slower and less punishing level.<br /><br />I liked that the book wasn't just focused on running. Many times, Murakami asserts that running and being a novelist are two similar activities. In fact, he began long-distance running when he decided to become a novelist, and the two have gone hand-in-hand ever since. As Murakami says, you have to be a certain type of person to be a novelist and a long-distance runner--one who has the stamina and endurance to go the distance, whether in a marathon or in a long-form novel. The process for both is often punishing and requires significant training and preparation. Both require a significant amount of pain.<br /><br />In addition, since Murakami wrote the book later in life, it often muses on the process of aging--when you realize that no matter what you do, your body is just not going to respond as well as it once did. Coming to terms with this is one of the main themes of the book, and I think Murakami's attitude of acceptance but unwillingness to stop pushing himself is one that we should all consider.<br /><br />For people searching for a narrative about running, the memoir also provides detailed information about Murakami's extensive running experiences--from his participation in an ultramarathon (which ended up becoming an almost out-of-body experience) to his recent decision to do triathalons. He also discusses the rhythms, pleasures, pain, and solitary nature of long-distance running.<br /><br />About the Narration: Ray Porter was an excellent narrator. He read with a commitment that made it seem as if he had written these words himself. In fact, it felt like someone talking to you rather than someone reading another person's book. The translation from Japanese must have been top-notch too as I found the language to be wonderfully lucid and flowing. After hearing so much about the strangeness  and weirdness of Murakami's fiction, I feel relieved that he was so accessible in this book. Hopefully this is the start of a beautiful relationship between the two of us.<br /><br />Recommended for: Murakami fans, runners and those who appreciate well-written memoirs.ll as it once did.

B003UYUP58|4.0|A REVIEW OF THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION<br /><br />It is a testament to Mukherjee's writing that I listened to 20 hours and 49 minutes of this audiobook with relatively little discomfort. Billed as \\"a biography of cancer,\\" this book is ambitious. Examining cancer from its earliest appearances in medical history to present day developments, Mukherjee takes his complex and wide-ranging subject and breaks it down into understandable pieces. He also manages to make it personal. Using the case history of one of his patients diagnosed with leukemia as a framing device for the book, Mukherjee never forgets that behind all the technological advances, clinical studies, fundraising efforts, legislation and research are real people fighting for their lives. By putting human stories front and center (just like the Jimmy Fund), Mukherjee makes what could have been a dry and incomprehensible book come alive with stories that each of us can relate to.<br /><br />I was surprised how fascinating the history of cancer turned out to be. So many scientists, physicians, surgeons and researchers have struggled to understand and \\"cure\\" this elusive disease. Hearing about the various breakthroughs that led to our current understanding of cancer was almost like reading a suspense novel. Who would figure out the \\"cause\\" of cancer? When would they make a link between smoking and lung cancer? When would surgeons realize that radical mastectomies were not a cure for breast cancer? Aside from the medical issues surrounding cancer research, Mukherjee also spends a fair amount of time on the politics of cancer--from the fundraising and advocacy efforts of Mary Lasker to the radical advocacy of groups like ACT UP. One lesson repeated time and time again is that breakthroughs in cancer treatments often happen because of passionate and dedicated people who won't take no for an answer.<br /><br />One downside of reading/listening to this book is that you will come to feel that developing cancer of some form or another is an almost inevitable part of being human. If my understanding of this book is accurate, cancer is essentially a part of each and every one of us--built into our very genes and waiting only to be activated by a combination of triggers that may or may not happen in our lifetime. We can take every precaution we want (not smoking, exercising regularly, eating healthily) but might develop a type of cancer. The good news is that many types of cancer can be successfully treated (even vanquished). The bad news, however, is that a universal cure for cancer is a myth. Like people, cancer has numerous different forms and, in many ways, is adapting and evolving along with our understanding and treatment of it. As upsetting as this may sound, I still think it is best to understand the history and nature of  cancer and be ready to fight if and when the time comes. And, with any luck, we'll each have an oncologist as gifted and humane as Dr. Mukherjee heading up our treatment.<br /><br />A Word About the Narration: The narrator, Simon Hoye, was certainly given a challenge in reading this book, and he did a pretty good job. However, I felt his voice was ill-suited for such a long listen. I needed a little more color and nuance and expression and often found myself longing for a different narrator.or another is an almost inevitable part of being human.

0316789798|5.0|My oldest three love this book! They fight over whose turn it is to use the book. And they can all very easily follow the instructions, even the 2 year old who cannot read! It really is a fabulous book for kids. We've had a great many masterpieces that begin with this book! Plus it is helping me teach the younger ones their shapes.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Gina's acting was surprisingly good for her first movie and of course she is gorgeous. Her fight scenes were actually good (I hate the silly fake kung fu fight scenes in most movies) and realistic. The long drawn out scenes with music and no talking; really who thought that was a good idea? The plot was horrible because there was none. To be honest, the movie put me to sleep. It could have been good but Gina was handed a crap story line for her first film. The best thing about this movie was Gina, the worst thing about this movie was the movie.

0765316994|4.0|John Scalzi's \\"Redshirts\\" boldly asks a question that has been bothering Star Trek (The Original Series) fans for the past 40 years:<br /><br />Don't the red-shirted crew members that always accompany the captain on away missions realize they are fated to die in horrible and undignified ways?<br /><br />In \\"Redshirts,\\" a small group of ensigns does recognize that something is very wrong with the starship Intrepid, flagship of the Universal Union fleet. In fact, it's as if their lives were part of a scripted drama--and not a very well-written one at that. To get to the root of the problem, they embark on an improbable and fantastic journey through time, space, and the outer limits of reality to confront the present-day Hollywood figures who control their fate. Negotiating 21st century Hollywood may be a bit of a challenge for spacemen from the future, but what obstacle can hold back a team of determined and resourceful red shirts?<br /><br />Going lightly where others have repeatedly trod before (e.g., \\"Star Drek,\\" \\"Galaxy Quest\\"), Scalzi coaxes humor from well-known weaknesses in Star Trek, including silly and contrived plot devices, implausible situations, scenery-chewing performances, and cheap deus ex machina technological resolutions to ticking-time-bomb situations. (He doesn't bother lampooning \\"reverse the phase oscillation variance on the flux capacitor quantum matrix\\" technobabble, which is just as well.) He also creates a varied and sympathetic cast of characters who, just like the rest of us, want to be the authors of their own lives.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's sci-fi, it's meta-fiction, and it's better than I expected. Most readers will find it to be quick-moving, clever, light, and enjoyable.<br /><br />P.S.: The three \\"codas\\" are really appendices. The first is a funny but bloated bit about a Hollywood sci-fi writer struggling against Quiller-Couch's dictum (\\"murder your darlings\\"); the second is  mostly pointless; and the third is sweet. None of them are mandatory reading.are mandatory reading.

B006ON41FC|3.0|its fun at first but it just gets boring after that. all you do is try to collect nuts and then buy things. I would not buy this app.  it is not worth the money.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app uses the names of so called &quot;rap stars&quot; that use tons of inappropriate language, plus these &quot;rap stars&quot; smoke, Drink, and do drugs in there own music videos.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Series Overall 4 or 4.1. Worth reading for adults and older teens.<br /><br />The Hunger Games--very well written. A great read. Immediate and engaging action from start to finish. Interesting, well-rounded characters, strong female protagonist, intriguing sci-fi/fantasy premise that allows good social commentary. Couldn't put it down from start to finish. 5 stars.<br /><br />Catching Fire--writing still strong, but not as visceral. Slow starter, somewhat confusing and abrupt end. Beginning good for introspective teen angst, however, and middle excellent. 4 stars.<br /><br />Mockingjay--writing good, but not as engaging. More action, but with a sense of detachment necessary given premise of narrator's role and narrator's own introspective state. Works with the narrative, but makes the narrative voice less appealing. Strong protagonist less independent and assertive, which adds to somewhat stifled feel of book. Heroine in situation and mental state somewhat similar to that in New Moon, but circumstances of Mockingjay make this an exploration of and commentary on PTSD-like conditions as opposed to simply weak-minded teenage self-absorption. Infinite improvement. Some brief shining moments of heartbreaking insight and beauty among the chaff. Strong and satisfying ending even if journey is somewhat like slogging through swap to get there. 3.5
0345803485|2.0|I read the book, but must admit...I scanned through the sadistic sex acts.  I have only finished it to read the story and find out what happens next.  I cannot believe women that would really get excited over getting spanked, etc.  Something wrong here.... don't get it.  Overboard for me, however, I'm on the third book of the triology .... only for the story ... not the dirty sex....nobody is that horny unless they have a problem.....thank God for some mystery in it now and then............after that I'm done.....
B007SYWFRM|4.0|enjoy playing, had the exit issue but figured out how to press the options button and then the menu bar opens up &amp; no update so I can visit friends....
020161622X|4.0|This book is well written and contains valuable information about software development and practices.<br /><br />It is highly recommended if you are starting in this field as this will set you up and get you going in the right direction.<br /><br />If you are, however, an experienced software developer you can quickly skim through it. There was very little new for me. My colleagues and I already follow many of the practices mentioned in the book. It is good to have it on a bookshelf as a reference anyway.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome! love the listen feature, i can take my bible everywhere, search and plans are great! could not ask for better, thank you
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I really loved this author's first book, \\"Sister: A Novel,\\" and I truly looked forward to \\"Afterwards.\\"  Like Sister, Afterwards is told in first person, present tense, by Grace who is speaking to her husband who can not hear her.  As much as I enjoyed this tense in Sister, I found it to be a bit monotonous in Afterwards.  I sometimes found myself skimming what felt like too much repetition of the same subjects and feelings.  Lupton is an amazing writer, but the story just felt a bit too tedious and repetitious at times.<br /><br />This is the story of a mother who races into a burning school to save her teenage daughter; both are critically injured in the fire which is determined to be arson.  Grace tells the story from the day of the fire until the mystery of who set the fire--and why--is solved, all the while in torment over her daughter's severe injuries, her young son who is blamed for the arson, and her husband who she dearly loves.  I won't say further for fear of spoilers.<br /><br />In conclusion, I wish I had loved this book more.  It is a great story full of emotion and suspense.  I wish I could give it five stars.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|this app is so cool i think u shood by it<br />it is a great music player simple to use .
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Beautiful graphics, interesting puzzles, and most of all......not your typical hidden object game. Loved it! Cant wait for more games from this developer!

0756656230|5.0|I originally bought this book for myself, but my 3 year old son fell in love with it. It is his favorite book. He likes to browse throughout it several times a day. He is totally fascinated by it. He loves Lego (Duplo) and he loves this book.<br /><br />The LEGO book is great. One can learn about the history of Lego brick and the vast variety of sets created. It's a wonderful book for any Lego enthusiast.<br /><br />The mini figurine book is stunning. It features heaps of little dudes in a great detail. I had absolutely no idea that there could be so many different ones.
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|We have 3 great actors working with some good material. Even if you know nothing about birding, this is an enjoyable movie.
0439023513|5.0|The book is a great conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy. If you expect some fairy-tale ending, then you'd be missing the point.<br /><br />Only thing I have to comment, is that I felt the last part of the book, that the author had to make some kind of a statement. Like the last part was a bit rushed. But I still give it five stars, due to a more realistic point of view.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun. a lot of different variety. works good on my kindle fire.<br />and its free. the adds aren't that annoying.<br />just x out of them and they're gone.
B000FC1AOI|4.0|This book wasn't exactly how I thought it would be, but I did enjoy most of it. I really liked the whole idea of the main character grieving with the help of her deceased husband. I also do like that the author didn't just put her into another full relationship during the book, but really focused on how she handled the grief. There were some aspects of the book, that did turn me off though--the rough language especially. However, I would read another of her books.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Although I regret having to spend three dollars, This game was totally worth it. Everything changes, making more interest in the game, but the concept is still the same. They have all of these new features, but they kept the birds vs pigs concept. They didn't even change it for the worse like you would expect in things like this.<br />All in all, this is the best game since the original, and it may end up being more popular than that.<br />To phrase it shorter, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO. It's worth it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game<br />would tell others about game. money well spent game good for children and adult alike. I love it as an adult.

0439023521|4.0|The book was in good condition.  It was a quick read.  The story was interesting but is probably more appealing to teenagers which I did not realize when I ordered it.  I'm not sorry I ordered it since now I'm up to date when I hear this book mentioned on TV, etc.  The movie was good too.

0439023491|2.0|A children's book, that went awry. Most of what I have to say has been said already in great detail, from the soap-opera filler of the book, to Katniss' transformation into an unintuitive, whining, incapable and annoying character, to the relentlessness of the \\"action\\" (I'm pro-action, but you need to give a break every so often, it's like holding the reader's head under water and drowns the interest. Anyone in film will tell you that.)<br /><br />SPOILer ALERT<br /><br />But what I found funniest/weakest and most indicative of 21st century America is that Peeta needs to be saved because he is a natural politician, because we need a guy who paints pretty pictures on cupcakes, is a whiz with camouflage, and who is superb at manipulating people using the media, who is quick with the cliche lies he knows will stir up emotions in the great, idiotic Unwashed that is the TV viewing audience. Basically, when it comes down to it, Haymitch is a Karl Rove and Peeta is...an ideal Republican candidate, say a young Ronnie Reagan.<br /><br />I agree as well that this book was un-necessary. What's more it even felt like it was written after the other two, that the first was delivered as one longer book and the publisher asked her to make it a bit longer so they could make a trilogy out of it. I'd recommend skipping this book and just getting the last, Mockingjay, if you really need to know what happens in the end.
B005LAIGLO|1.0|Wow, its really bad.  Bad acting and story line.  don't waste your money.I just wish i can rate this less than one star.
0756407125|5.0|A continuation of Name of the Wind, we meet Kvothe back at his tavern, continuing his story on the second day. We learn more of Kvothe's story, but we do not yet learn why he is the Kingkiller. We do, however, get to know a bit about Young Adult Kvothe and more about his time at the University.<br /><br />I received this book on the day of release from my local library, and devoured its contents within 10 days. I was enthralled, reluctant to put the book down to work, sleep, eat, or go about my daily tasks. I look forward to the last book of this series, but know I will have to be patient until it is released, as Rothfuss takes his time to ensure that his work is of high quality before it is sent for publication.

075640407X|5.0|I was introduced to this book back in 2008 when I started working at a public library; one of my coworkers had discovered that I read science fiction and fantasy (among other genres) and immediately recommended that I try this book. I was not disappointed. Written in an epic fantasy style, Rothfuss builds a world that is familiar and yet has a story that is original and compelling. We all want to hear Kvothe tell of his childhood and the fantastic journey that he strives to hide as a tavern owner in a small town, newly overridden by deadly spider-like creatures that roam the countryside, attacking townfolk, tinkers and anyone else on the road.<br /><br />Though Kvothe frequently falls into the \\"Boy Hero Who Can Do No Wrong\\" trope, he is a sympathetic character who manages to overcome obstacles while still occasionally bungling up his progress.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|Have only cleared 13 levels, but this game is very playable without putting any cash onto it (ie: buying coins to spend on upgrades). The pachinko machine seems to help. Practice by flipping a few balls in to see how far you have to pull the lever (at bottom right). Then, toss as many balls into the air as you can for extra bonus. Also, every 10 levels appears to give you a big payout for killing a boss.

I love that if you miss a couple of days you can have the app &quot;catch you up&quot; which will take you back to where you left off. the only downside yo this app is you cant use it offline.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|l don't know what I'd do without evermore on my phone and kindle.  one place to keep what I need to fond!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|So good.  This is the album that I've been waiting for since 1984.  Good hooks, blistering guitar work, and Diamond Dave doing his thing.  I love it.  Not just saying this because it's something I've wished for for the past 20 years - if it was mediocre, I would be disappointed, admit it immediately, and write these guys off for good (as I had thought about after Van Halen III).  Instead, they put out something that is easily on par with any of their classic albums, and better than some of those (I'm looking at you, Fair Warning).  Enjoy it.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this was a great movie. It is a great movie with just your own screen, but it is better in theatres for its 3-D. Most movies suffer from 3-d, however, in avatar the three dimensionality is introduced seemingly with the rest. Its like the music, the actors, the special effects, it is integrated into the film that it becomes natural instead of forced upon.<br /><br />The one downfall of this movie, i would say, its is story. It features a very cliche storyline that probably hundred other films, books and other media have alread explored. But because of its fantasy setting and surreal environment, it is still intriguing to the point that one can neglect the flaw within its plot.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. If aiming for perfect score, game gets exponentially challenging as the mimunum number of moves increases and as map gets bigger.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This case is functional but the value is not there; it it is way over priced. I decided to keep it as returning it would not be worth the hassle.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Saw Hugh Laurie make music for the first time on PBS..it was a pleasant surprise since I used to watch him on \\"House\\" and never thought he had a musical bone in him...well, not really anyway.<br />That PBS show sold me on this CD...also bought one for my FIL...I know he would love this :-)
0446615625|1.0|I was unable to get more then three quarters of a way through the book. I liked the other book that I read which was written by him, but this one has turned me off on him for the rest of my life. Straight up liberal propaganda. The United States created terrorists. America bad, terrorists misunderstood. No thanks ever again Dave.
B002T44ZYW|5.0|This book started off super slow. The first half was super boring but when the show starts things start getting interestiing. At the beginning the book I would have given it 1 star but the ending totally changed my view of this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading this series, I think that I have been far too generous in rating books. It has left little room to rate Wool 1-5 accurately.  I would give it six stars, if I could.  I've only read one other new piece of fiction in its class in several years, which I also found among the Kindle bestsellers.  I doubt I can add much the the 600+ reviews already written--I just wanted to say I really enjoyed this book.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|so far no bugs. looooooove this game. would be nice for the option to buy shapes and different brush styles in kindle version. still awesome
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It is a good Bible, but it is really difficult to highlight in it.  The dictionary feature is nice. It is easy to get to your notes. I like being able to change the font size.  What I really like is being able to change the translation when I want.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Reviewed by Alyssa<br /><br />To sum it up: When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \\"perfect\\" life is about to unravel before her eyes. She's forced to be lab partners with Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the other side of town, and he is about to threaten everything she's worked so hard for- her flawless reputation, her relationship with her boyfriend, and the secret that her home life is anything but perfect.<br /><br />Alex is a bad boy and he knows it. So when he makes a bet with his friends to lure Brittany into his life, he thinks nothing of it. But soon Alex realizes Brittany is a real person with real problems, and suddenly the bet he made in arrogance turns into something much more...<br /><br />..I'll admit, I was a little hesitant about reading this book- To be quite honest, one reason is because I was afraid since the hero/heroine were both still in high school, that the entire book would have a bit of a... well... immature feel- but aside from a few cheesy lines here or there, this book was pretty good! Oh, and if you're curious by what I mean when I say \\"cheesy\\" and \\"immature\\", here's an example:<br /><br />\\"Come on Colin... we don't need these pathetic lame-o's anyway.\\"<br /><br />Pathetic lame-o's. ...Enough said.<br /><br />Aside from all that, I really liked this book, although it didn't really blow me away, which is probably one reason why I don't really have much to say while writing this review. One of the things I liked most about this story however, was the importance that was placed on outside appearances- we've learned from the story-line, that they're not always what they seem, and you should never make judgments based on appearances alone. Alex is a character with many different layers- he's your typical bad-boy. A tough gang member. Loyal friend. And a good student, although he tries to pretend he's anything but. Brittany on the other hand, may look like she has it all on the outside, but just like everyone else, she struggles with many issues, mainly revolving around her family.<br /><br />One thing that I really loved, was the fact that the narrative flipped from Brittany's perspective, to Alex's- this really gave you a glimpse into what was going on through both of their heads. Heck! Who does't like to get the best of both worlds while reading a romance novel? I felt that the pace of the novel was done really well, and I was truly immersed in this story from start to finish.<br /><br />Simone Elkeles is an exceptional writer- her style of writing is as addictive as the story being told. Oh, and she definitely had me falling head-over-heels in love all over again, for those bad-boys! *sigh* ...This was a slightly predictable, but fun romance- and although I wouldn't say this story would win any rewards on originality, I liked it just the same :)he has it all on the outside, but just like everyone else, she struggles with many issues, mainly revolving around her family.<br /><br />One thing that I really loved, was the fact that the narrative flipped from Brittany's perspective, to Alex's- this really gave you a glimpse into what was going on through both of their heads.

B007H02I4W|5.0|Wow, it's great to listen to an entire album where every cut is this worthwhile and this good! No mediocre tracks, no filler. Just pure music, acoustic bliss. This is some of the best new jazz I've heard this year in 2012. I must be getting old though, because that last sentence almost sounded like the Zager and Evans song, In The Year 2525. But If The Brad Mehldau Trio and I ARE still alive, I'll still be listening to them, especially if they sound this great. Ode is easily a top contender for best jazz record of the year, essential music for today and Brad's best since Day is Done. Lots of rhythmic playfulness and shifting moods from Mehldau and company. Some of the compositions reveal themselves over time, making multiple listenings both pleasurable and rewarding. This is a generous portion of jazz, a full course meal, a complete banquet of heady, meaty, profound and nourishing piano trio jazz goodness. Yum!
B000002LQR|5.0|First off this Red Hot Chilli Peppers cd, is there first great cd. Mothers milk, there cd before this was a good bridge into this great cd.<br /><br />  It has, My favorite song by them 'Under The Bridge'. It also has a great song 'Breaking the girl'.<br /><br />  Some of the songs sound the same. However, George Clinton's funk, that he instilled in Freaky Styley, is still here. You will love this cd.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I loved the ebook Mile 81. It was simple to order and on my kindel very quickly. It's an effection way to receive books and have them on hand to read whenever the notion hits you. Love my new life with my Kendel.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|I will admit that, objectively, this is not a great film.  It's weak performance at the box office effectively put an end to the Conan series and meant that Brigitte Nielsen was not going to be a star (like there was ever much chance of that!).  Still, if you were young enough when you first saw it, it does retain a certain appeal.  Richard Fleischer could always direct a reasonably good movie and the action is decent, although the dialog is -- admittedly -- pretty bad a lot of the time.  And, of course, you get to look at Brigitte and Sandhal Bergman -- who I always thought was insanely hot.<br /><br />Definitely a guilty pleasure, but given how cheap the DVD is, what have you got to lose?
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Very enjoyable listening. She's the 40's, rock'n roll and ballads all in one.Her voice and style draws you right in to the soul!
B004KKYX9K|5.0|This is the first book by this author I have read & I enjoyed it very much. I was drawn to it because of the lesbian characters and wasn't disappointed, didn't want to put it down. All in all a great read
B003O86FMW|4.0|i am not done with the book but i like it. i am hope the movie is as good or close to it
B007549W62|4.0|I couldn't help but sit dumbfounded scene after scene.  The opening scene of a nuclear attack on New York is all you need to set up a group of survivors stuck in the basement to await the fallout.  But the movie takes so many twists and turns I was dumbstruck.  I've never had a movie leave my jaw hanging as much as this one and still continue to surprise scene after scene.  In the end you are left with an \\"I can't believe that just happened\\" feeling.<br /><br />What the movie was trying to do and what others seem to be missing, is set up what it would be like for people stuck in a basement experiencing the nuclear fallout.  How not only being cooped up in the basement with no hope for survival and all the psychological traps involved there, but also succumbing to the radiation of the blast and the toll that it took on the survivors.  This movie explores the what ifs of that scenario, one where there doesn't seem to be any hope for survival and yet they must all co-exist with one another.<br /><br />Granted it is dark and takes turns you wonder if it would have happened in real life, but in the end you accept it for what it is because each group of survivors is made up of a different group of personalities, and thus all reactions change.  I would recommend this definitely if you are ready for a mind trip.  Definitely not for everyone, but definitely worth watching and is best to go in to this one completely blind to the plot.  It has that much more of an effect on the viewer when you know absolutely nothing.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
0790729601|5.0|Maybe because it came near the end of his time as a legitimate superstar, this film never received the recognition it deserves.  It did decent business at the box office, but given its budget, I'm not sure whether it fully covered its production costs.  At any rate, I think it is Arnold's best film.  The plot is good, the action is terrific -- the scene on the plane with James Caan is worth the price by itself -- and Arnold delivers his usual high-energy performance.  The co-stars, Venessa Williams and James Caan, are also very good.  Is it a better movie than the Terminator films?  Well, to my mind the first Terminator film is the best, but Arnold is not really being Arnold in that one -- if you know what I mean; he is just stalking and killing.  I would rank this film above the later Terminator films, so in that sense I think it actually is Arnold's best film.<br /><br />One other note:  Although the film is rated R, I think that must have been a close call even in 1996.  Today, I think it would certainly be rated PG-13.  So, if you haven't seen this one before, you are in for a treat especially given how cheap the DVD is.
0786852550|4.0|Bartimeas has to be one of the funniest characters I've encountered in ages. His one-liners are great and his character really makes this book. This book was a great take on the genie myth and I liked the new slant that the author put on it - you don't expect to read about a genie in old world London. To start with I found the changes in veiwpoint a bit strange - Bartimeas bits are in first person and the other characters bits are in third person, but I soon got used to it. This was a great story and I've already ordered the other two in the series.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|One of the best books I had ever read!! Couldn't set this book down! It was a feel good read :)
B0054N73EY|5.0|At first listen I was hooked but not impressed. By the third hearing though it really began to hit me just how brilliant it all was. This usually happens like this for me with the albums I end up treasuring most, they hit me gradually with their wow-factor.<br /><br />My only issue now is with whoever it is that picks the singles to be released and made into videos! I mean I love the songs they've picked but there are far more lustrous gems they could present, ya know? Factory of Faith, Look Around, and Police Station practically demand music vids!
B007G5O3K0|3.0|Now that a-ha has broken up, a new Morten Harket solo album is better than nothing.<br /><br />Morten's still Morten vocally, but without Pal and Mags' input lyrically and musically, this album doesn't emote and shine as a-ha's albums did.<br /><br />This very short set of 10 songs is pleasant enough, but it lacks gems or any songs with true punch or power that hit your heart or body. Even a-ha's lesser albums contained at least a few gems.<br /><br />Most of the time, Harket delivers contemplative songs with vocals reminiscent of what he did on later a-ha albums. There are a few moments where he goes for something different, a bit more clubby/dance-like, but Harket seems a bit in limbo, as if he's wading in between a-ha's ending and where he wants to go... something he doesn't yet know.<br /><br />So perhaps the title \\"Out of My Hands\\" is a reference to their breakup? I don't know, but it would be nice if, in the future, Harket gets his hands on the wheel and takes full control, with a strong vision and strong idea of where to steer to.<br /><br />Most a-ha fans won't hate it -- as this is a likeable album -- but it just won't hit you as a-ha albums did. More than anything, listening to this album makes me want to start playing my a-ha albums.
B003UD7JEO|2.0|I bought this show based on the great rating here on Amazon. How could that many people be wrong? This show is best described as \\"total crap done extremely well\\". It is a wannabe show. It wants to be \\"Dark Angel\\" but doesn't have Cameron. It wants to be \\"Dollhouse\\" but doesn't have Whedon. The production value is very high, but strip all the hoopla away and the dialogue is predictable, mundane, and high-school.<br />Without the Alex character (I could watch Fonseca knit for an hour and not get bored), I would not have gotten as far through it as I did. Thus the 2nd star. In the end, I could stand no more and put it back on the shelf before finishing the season. The only other TV show I've done that with is \\"Miracles\\".<br />Maggie Q is like Demi Moore in G.I. Jane -- simply not physically believable in the role. If she's so bad-ass that the most well-trained hoods in the world fall before her like dominos, she ought not to have the build of a runway model. Just sayin'.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works great. Keeps my CPU from over heating and for the price it's really cheap insurance to boot. I highly recommend this product.<br />Cheers<br />Ron
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|It took some time to appreciate the format in which this was written but I'm glad I persisted. It became quite compelling - an emotional journey with many layers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. It is my go-to for a brain taxer. I've had no problems with using the game app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is fun and easy to play. there are a lot of levels though and it is hard to get points. I would recomend.
0385344228|5.0|I loved this book! I read it in two sittings. Great, compelling writing; interesting story; complex characters. William Landay is a new author for me, and I'm slow to adopt new authors... but this book was wonderful! The pages turned quickly, but the story was rich and fulfilling. Great book. If you like John Connelly, you'll love this! Excellent!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I know I am just scratching the surface still on learning what Evermore can do but it has been useful so many times in the few weeks I have had it.<br /><br />I love its ease of use.  It makes sharing data between my Kindle Fire and desktop a breeze.  I used the checklist feature to prepare for a trip.  That extra bit of organization made things go so much smoother on the day we left.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this app.  Get it for your tablet and computer both and enjoy as it keeps your data seemlessly synced on both.  The web version lets you access your data from any Internet connected computer.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Some excellent characterisations. Confronting subject matter, not normally encountered at a personal level. Made me see things from a different perspective. Would certainly recommend this book.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love it so much its awesome 100%i cant stop playing it my little step sister wont let me play it
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I love the music, but I don't think the recording was digitally mastered. I first heard this band when I heard the song \\"you ain't alone\\" playing in the background of a commercial, I've been in loved ever since. I love the leads raspy raw voice, I'm a fan.
B005H29GSI|1.0|We as many others here love the angry birds computer/smart phones games, my kids were so happy when we bought this game they are 5 and 8 yo. The toy claims it can be played by a 5 year old kid but that is not true, they can not setup the pieces as described on the cards, they need help. I got really frustrated trying to help my kids setup the pieces as the cards indicate. If you think you will spend time destroying the fortified pig castles (which is what the original Angry Birds games do)you are wrong, you will spend probably 80 or 90 % of your time trying to put the pieces together and only a small amount of time actually doing what angry birds do. The main issue about the pieces is that the design is not good so you need to be extra careful while trying to put one on top of the other, probably they did it on purpose so that you could destroy them more easily but MANY TIMES that makes the pieces fall while setting them up.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Nice game but I don't like that you have to pay for stuff with real money. I like the game but wish the time went by faster.
B001H5X7JS|3.0|The video stopped at around 1:02 during an especially funny part of the movie.  It finally skips its way over the bad spot but you miss a whole scene.  I checked the disk, and it has lots of dings on the playing side.  Lots of scrapes that won't rub off.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the app. Love the ability to have a reading plan to further my walk with God. Multiple versions of the Bible to read along to or listen to. Also enjoy the live portion so I can follow along in church.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it just like some of the facebook games that we know and love. it so cool the kids like it. just as much as my wife and I do.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|I bought this one because I like it better than the first one. The first one was ok, but the blood squirting looked so fake. It looked like a lawn sprinkler. In the second one it is more realistic.
0385534639|5.0|This is quite simply one of the most magical, rich, and lyrical books I have read in a long time. I enjoyed every minute of it and found myself missing it when it was done.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|games is very addicting i enjoy the way it was set up and i would recomend it to any one who like tower defence or rpg

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is really good but some games in here don't have good instruction so the game does not work.  but over all,  great app!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app has the best games anyone could get for free.  I love all the games because they are challenging.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is rightfully getting credit as one of the best superhero movies the genre has to offer.  Long, but well-paced, the mix of intense action and clever dialogue keeps the interest level high throughout, and all of the actors give fully entertaining performances.  On the action, special effects take center stage, but I never felt like any shot moved too fast to follow what was happening, or that anything looked overly CGI.  As for the dialogue, it includes a healthy dose of humor, but it's typically more witty than corny, and a couple of scenes are downright hilarious.  And the acting showed great chemistry among all of these characters.  I've seen most of their solo movies, and they stick closely to the personalities already established in those films.  The only one I haven't seen is Edward Norton's Incredible Hulk, but Mark Ruffalo's take on the character is one of the highlights of The Avengers.  Not only is he very authentic and convincing as Bruce Banner, but I enjoyed the Hulk's scenes more than just about anything in the movie.  In fact, he's in what I think are the two funniest scenes.  I don't want to spoil them, but they involve punching Thor and slamming Loki around like a rag doll; both completely cracked me up!  On a last note, Loki provides a perfectly sinister villain to drive the plot and keep the stakes high, and almost makes the movie seem like a half-sequel to Thor.  Even though the expectations for The Avengers were ridiculously high, I think director Joss Whedon and the cast have met them and given fans a real treat.<br /><br />If you see this in the theater, make sure you stick around for the two Easter eggs in the credits.  One gives a big hint about the sequel, and the other is a wry, but very funny, punch-line to a joke from near the movie's end.  They're both worth sticking around for, even if you have to go to the rest-room as badly as I did.  Great movie by Marvel and Whedon!  I can't wait for the next one.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app, except I can't access it offline. It would be an extraordinary app if I could us it offline.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is an exceptional author who has extensive knowledge (probably more than most theists) concerning world religions.  If you pick this book up while religious, you will come out secular (if not atheist) at the end.  Dawkins entertainingly exposes holes in religions and explains why you should stop believing in an imaginary man in the sky.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A read that you do not want to put down! When you have to put down the book, it is always in the back of your mind to run back to the book! I could not wait to finish this book and start the next one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Erotic, passionate and kept me squirming in my seat.  I couln't put this book down.  Anastasia keeps Christian on his toes, literally.  He being the dominant is being lead around by the collar easily by sweet innocent Anastasia.  Loved it!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is fun. I do enjoy the bakery game a bit more. Maybe because I started that onecfirdt. I have kindle fire, it works great.
B004ZQRJFO|2.0|This album wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. While I think Eminem and Royce are some of the best rappers out, the album still falls flat. The album only has four stand out tracks (Fastline, The Reunion, I'm On Everything, and A Kiss) and the beats are not that great. The subject matter is weak. Alot of anti women talk and most of the songs are forgettable. Even songs where the duo tried to ''be deep'' (Lighters and Take From Me) come off very corny and felt like they were added just to fill up the album.<br /><br />Overall they could have and should have come alot better. Maybe next time
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good app for beginners and oldies. Whenever I have a thought I can always go to this app and find scripture.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I've read the first several books and enjoyed them immensely. When I started watching the series on my computer to catch up on HBO's version, I was astonished at how true to the books it was.Keep it up HBO an Amazon.
0345803485|2.0|Ok, let me start by saying that I'm not a literary genius. As much as I love to read, and I do read a lot, I'm not an expert critic, who could point out the flaws and victories in a book. But it did not take me long to notice a few things. The first, and most important, is that the language used is very amateurish and repetitive. In a moment supposed to be erotic, the \\"innocent\\" - I like to call her plain DUMB- Anastasia would be saying things like \\"Oh my.\\" or \\"Jeez\\".<br />Pardon me if that's a turn off. Therefore, the \\"erotica\\" in this book did nothing for me at all.<br />Anastasia's character is beyond annoying to me. She does not seem like a 21 year old in 2011, but a 14 year old in 1961.<br />And so I had to push thru and finish the god damned book, even though I was the one rolling my eyes every time she would open her mouth.<br /><br />Now, I must admit that there's something fascinating about the Christian Grey, and somehow, specially towards the very end, him and him alone makes you want more, and I will be reading book 2.<br /><br />So the bottom line is, had someone, anyone (!!) an editor, perhaps? interfered with this amateurish writing and repetition pattern and completely unsexy talk, this would have been a great great book.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|great value at a mere 75 cents! variety of household and natural/outdoors sounds. most very good and realistic. download the ones you want- select from list and then hit &quot;play&quot;. if already playing you need to hit &quot;stop&quot; first .plays well on kindle fire with no noticeable gaps for loops.  best when layering 2 or 3 sounds, volume adjustable for each individual sound. can even play if you hit power button to do quick shutoff on the fire (so you don't have the glow of the device keeping you up!). excellent app.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I've heard a lot of good things about this book, and a lot of bad things, so I was quite curious to see what it was all about. I shouldn't have bothered.<br /><br />The characters are lackluster and boring, as is their relationship. Anastasia is immediately unbelievable as a completely innocent and awkward twenty-one year old, with weird inconsistencies later on as she seems to develop a drinking habit and constantly lusts after mysterious, brooding Christian. Christian is rich, hot, and inexplicably attracted to Anastasia. Why? There never seems to be a reason, and the result is that their chemistry is just plain old boring.<br /><br />Even though the characters immediately turned me off, I was hoping for an interesting Secretary-esque plot, where the main characters discover and explore BDSM together, and find that it suits them and brings them together in some weird, magical way. I was wrong, of course. The subject of BDSM is presented so clumsily that I nearly cringed while reading about it. Anastasia constantly relates BDSM to \\"hurting women,\\" and believing that it stems from Christian's troubled childhood, and so on and so forth. How is the reader supposed to enjoy a somewhat erotic book when the main character acts as though she's being sexually abused the whole time, and says things like, \\"Please don't hit me again,\\" in reference to erotic spanking? Yet she goes on and acts like a martyr while she continues her relationship with Christian, hoping that someday he will change.<br /><br />Frankly, I didn't see a thing about this book that would explain all the success it has had. Terrible characters, terrible plot, just plain terrible overall. Don't waste your time.
1603420398|5.0|Its wonderful book. I like it too much. Every thing is clear. Her way to explane is great and very easy to understand it. I hope to order the other book from her soon.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Really fun, kool chill music. Just a high end Eye Spy. :D Still fun, and worth the buy.  Works well on my Toshiba Thrive.
B007TML4EI|5.0|best and most addicting game ever. everyone in the universe should get this epic and beast app.  I can wait until Andrew garrison makes another app.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop Remote Desktop is great when you're couch surfing on your Kindle Fire and the site you want to visit doesn't have a webkit friendly version. You can connect to your home computer and use your favorite desktop browser. I recommend using this product when both your computer and your kindle fire are in the same local network. You can use it outside of your local network but there will be some lag, depending on the upload speed of your home ISP. Still, I give it five stars because it does exactly what I need for it to do. If your primary reason for using a remote desktop app is for work, I recommend Teamviewer instead.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]I for one am jumping off the bandwagon of this book.  It is nothing but a porn-filled harlequin novel.  It read like an instruction booklet for Violence against women.  So lame....Strong, rich man, with dark side meets virginal beauty that no-one has ever noticed, and she dives into this sadistic world with pleasure, yet has been raised by a value-based family? So unbelievable. An alarming piece of work that may come back to hurt someone. Let's hope this book doesn't land in the hands of an angry man.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|bugs seem fixed.  good instructions.  addictive game.  hours have been wasted already.  from grandchildren to kids to myself we all play a race.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just got this today, can't put it down. yes its a super mario bros.<br />knock-off, but it is really fun.

B0080CL0HM|5.0|Thank You Amazon for the pre-release of Bel Ami!  We appreciate it so much. I have been waiting patiently for this movie to come out for over a year!  To see it before it is even released in theatres is awesome and well worth the wait. The movie was great. Of course I read the book so I must say it was very easy for me to follow. Robert Pattinson as usual did an out standing job, and is as gorgeous as ever.  All the acting was great and the storyline followed true to Guy de Maupassants George Duroy.  I liked it so well that if it shows in my area, I will be the first in line to go see it..  Watch this movie in a theatre near you on June 8th when it will be released to the public..  Great movie
B007BVOEPI|5.0|i've looked at this series over and over again,and i can't enough about how much i enjoyed it.i'm looking forward to purchasing the second season which so far is very entertaining.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game good graphics. great deal if its free its for me. thankx!I wish I could get more energy quickly. it limits my playing time running out so quick.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|my friend told me about this movie so i said to myself why not. and this movie was amazing. for the date that the movie was made in it was awesome. it just wasn't the special effects it was the acting by yul Brynner, richard Benjamin and James Brolin and the rest of the cast. it wold be cool if westworld was real, without the killing robots. i just have to hand it to the film makers and the actors this is a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00723NWJE|3.0|Norah Jones has a lovely voice and the album is beautifully produced. The problem is almost every song is a ballad. I don't mean to sound harsh, but the whole album sounds like one song. It is very hard to find distinctions from song to song. I find it soothing as background music, but it just doesn't engage me. I'm not paying attention while listening, which isn't a good sign. She needs to change things up a bit....ballads, mid-tempos, and upbeat. Idk...what was her producer thinking? *shrug* There is still a large market for her music and I'm sure it will sell reasonably well. Then she'll be asked to sing at the Grammy's.......?
0807014273|5.0|The detachment with which the author plows through the deprivations of concentration-camp life (as he personally experienced) is erudite and emotional. The vivid imagery is caught in the mundane yet otherworldly details of camp survival techniques--whether using cigarettes as currency or clapping loudly to poor capo-poetry as a means of self-preservation--underpinning the despair that assailed the lives of the prisoners. In his account, love transcends the barbarism of genocide, shouted commands, lashings, and shows itself to be the greatest aspiration man can hold.<br /><br />At one point, the author, scantily clad, marches on frozen ground, before the pale light of dawn emerges, envisaging his wife, talking to her, relishing in her memory, occasionally interrupted by a falling prisoner, a whipping, a lashing, a shout, to return to the indelible warmth of her memory.<br /><br />There can be bliss in hell and strength of soul in a corpse-like man. The impetus of life is self-determination and meaningfulness in both the dark and light of humanity. This book centers on the notion that individual decisions define an one's future--not circumstances, external prejudices, or the environment. It is a book that celebrates the future, reveres age and experience, gives perspective to suffering and, most importantly, tells of freedom as value-less without \\"responsibleness\\"--in other words, life has naught to offer but the chance to offer it something; every hour, every day.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Everything this thing picks up also throws it right back out. The battery life is also junk. Spend your money on something you know will work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best Bible apps that I have ever used. I like useing the reading plan, I can get it emailed to my phone and read it even when I don't have Internet for my kindel
B003B02PEU|5.0|Just can't beat John Grisham books and The Last Juror was an A+.  I had this downloaded to my Kindle so that I could stay up late and read without disturbing my husband.  It is hard to put this one down.  My husband wonders why I am so sleepy in the morning.  He doesn't know I have been enjoying excitement with John instead of sleeping!!
B002ZG97LK|1.0|I receive this movie on a plain DVD with no cover. It was in a envelope with the title written on it.<br />Was not in any form of original packaging. Could not give as a gift!.
B0028O9WFU|5.0|\\"Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. \\"Mankind.\\" That word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that today is the Fourth of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live. To exist. And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: \\"We will not go quietly into the night!\\" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!\\"<br />[crowd cheers]<br /><br />Probably my favorite speech in American History. Barack has nothing on Bill Pullman. Not only did he give such a rousing speech, but then he flew the f'ing fighter jet against the Aliens! What other president would have that kind of moxie? This movie is an absolute gem. Will Smith's career has only gone downhill from this 1996 peak and can you even name a recent Jeff Goldblum movie? Most likely these stars were typecast in these roles and for good reason. If you like America, you need to own this movie. That is all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this game!! Its a great game to play if u want to waist time and if your not connected to internet.... i highly reccomend this game to everyone who has lots of time on there hands!!
B005C0DHEY|4.0|Warning: this movie may make you gag and shake your nerves.  The story of natural gas drilling's ill effects within the United States is made vivid and pungent here.  What's more, this is a tremendous documentary film that could engage anyone, I think, regardless of prior interest in the subject.  This film takes you \\"right there\\" -- to horrible sights, smells, and sickness across the country, in the midst of a 34-state drilling campaign for natural gas.<br /><br />The only thing holding me back from a full five stars is that I wonder if perhaps a bit more could have been done in the film to flesh out the why gas industry is doing what they're doing and why politicians have gone along with it.  It would have been helpful to see, as well, suggestions as to what environmentalists and public health advocates are making of the events shown in GasLand.  The film leaves one wondering how to learn more and do more to stand up for what's right.
B004SBX112|5.0|Really cool game, lots of fun. I bought the game on Amazon.com without the ads. My youngest likes to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mocking jay is a very good book! Kindle is awesome! I love how I could read this on my phone!
B0072GPQNG|3.0|Good movie, just not a great Horse movie.  I can think of others that were much better as a story and movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game. keeps you interested and always wanting to play more. I can play this game for hours. always interesting.
0345803485|1.0|I don't get it, an erotic book that is boring? And I don't know if the poor writing/grammar was done to impress the reader of how naive and dumb Anastasia is or what. I found it ironic, an English Lit major with little ability to write well crafted sentences -- either run on sentences or fragments, it was like trying to dicipher a child's first attempt at a paragraph. I can tell the author had television experience, she obviously knows popularity can be done with the most simplistic story line and most insipid characters as long as you appeal to the voyeuristic nature of people. The most depressing thing, it just encourages the belief as women as stupid, useless bimbos, waiting for a man to use them before they 'find' themselves. Pity that women are often their own worse enemies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very good book! Kindle is awesome! I love how I could read this on my phone!
B005S9EJZA|4.0|This is an Improbable chick flick. Logan (Zac Efron) didn't die in Iraq, like most of his unit. He credits a picture of a blond he found in the rubble for his survival. When he returns home, he is a bit jumpy and decides to walk from Colorado to Louisiana to locate the girl(Taylor Schilling) in the picture. As it turns out, she, Beth,  runs a kennel and before he can say anything to her, he is hired by \\"grandmother\\" (Blythe Danner) to be a helping hand. She has taken a shine to Logan while Beth thinks he is crazy. Beth also has a son (Riley Thomas Stewart). She has trouble dealing with the death of her brother in Iraq, who she feels died for no reason. The local sheriff (Jay R. Ferguson) is the father of Beth's child and he has some testosterone problems. The sheriff is more how young men really are: jealous, controlling, manipulative. Logan is how women want them to be.<br /><br />My \\"chick flick\\" detector went off when I saw the movie poster. You wait for him to tell her about the photo...which would have been better if she said, \\"That's not me, you have the wrong girl.\\" At which point he packs up and leaves, but they opted not to do it my way. This is a romance novel brought to the screen. The man is handsome, fit, intelligent, understanding, a good father, musically inclined, dances, fixes things up around the house, no vices, and a knight who protects his lady...not to mention the final soul mate connection. It hurt my brain to watch it, but the women seemed to love this fantasy.<br /><br />The film was well made and acted. Good music score. But it wasn't my cup of tea. I will go 4 stars based on other people's reaction and not my own. If you love romance novels, this is your book come to life.<br /><br />No f-bombs, no nudity, some love scenes. Is Zac Efron the new Fabio?
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Add me : HarleDoll. I love this game. keeps me occupied for hours. I have all the games by this creator. definitly download.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I thought this was a great book, incorporating some interesting ideas. It is certainly a riveting, quick and easy read and covers some important parts which the movie seemed to have missed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a very good book! Kindle is awesome! I love how I could read this on my phone!
0811729117|5.0|A great book from a true soldier who gives the reader another view from a German patriot.  Thus us a good book for the historian interested in not only tank warfare but the hardships if combat.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love it. I don't know why people are saying it sucks on kindle fire. I have a kindle fire and the app works fine.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Hello, I tried to 'get with one click' the Kindle for Android from amazon, and the response came up that there was a geographical problem. I live in Australia. Can I synch my Kindle with my android, and home computer?<br />I'm \\"down-under\\" and \\"not over the moon\\".<br />Can anyone help me.<br />p.s. I was successful in downloading & installing the apps for Android.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|The Change-Up is an example where the length of the movie was the biggest problem.  Two hours that surely should have been trimmed to less than 80.  You see when the humor was on, it was REALLY on and I was laughing extremely hard (such as the babysititng segment and the way Ryan Reynolds' character was holding the kids while running down the stairs and then setting them on the counter only to discover that the babies were ready to stick their heads in a nearby outlet or throw knives at Ryan's head).  THESE were great moments.  In fact any segment that focused on the babies was really memorable.  I was sort of weirded out whenever the one baby would frequently smack his head against the side of the crib because the film would sort of speed up, lol.<br /><br />The problem is that the humor is frequently sacrificed for romance that simply doesn't work, or rather (in the case of Ryan's character) feels totally tacked on when, for example, Ryan's character eventually falls in love with Olivia Wilde's character and it all just seemed TOTALLY pointless to me.  I truly don't understand why that entire segment was even necessary to be included.<br /><br />The storyline is that the always funny Jason Bateman (best actor by FAR in the movie) and Ryan Reynolds urinate and make a wish in a water fountain and when morning arrives they discover that they've been switched so Ryan's immature/silly personality is inside Jason's body, and Jason's professional/serious character is inside Ryan's.  The consequences are often unusual but sometimes they work (such as the segment when both Jason and Ryan were sitting in the living room and trying to convince Jason's wife that they've exchanged bodies and the wife laughing it off as a stupid joke).<br /><br />Another really annoying aspect is the way the characters would just blurt out REALLY obnoxious swear words.  This was totally unnecessary and certainly doesn't constitute quality writing.  Lots of nudity too.<br /><br />Again though, the movie is overlong by at least 30 minutes.  Trim away some of the useless fat at the end and I'd be a happier person and probably even raise the rating to a 4 out of 5.  Oh and the \\"bouquet of balls\\" joke said by the wife when the family was revealing personal information about each other as a way of getting revenge was a REALLY awesome line.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|it was great before some of the upgrades. I do enjoy handwritting my notes and not having to type them in.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just got it on my kindle fire and it works great. Plus its free! Starting to get addicted to the game
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is well-written and a compelling read.  I would recommend it for teens through adults.  The story builds through the three books with Book 2 being the most intriguing story.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Pretty easy to play and kid friendly too. Similar to Super Mario,  but easier. App works good on my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The biggest thing I love about the Bible app is that j have all these different translations at my fingertips. I also love the reading plans built into it.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|This book is a waste of money. All it is; is page after page of 'nothing advise' I kept reading thinking, he is going to get to the point any minute now but never did. It was pretty much a brag book. I wish I hadn't wasted by $2.99 or my time reading it!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The game is truly diserving of its stars if not more. it combines stradegy with brute force inabling u to go all out or play it safe.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game I really enjoy playing wish there could be more things to do. looking fornmore acorns without paying. will continue to play
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Lots of fun<br /> may become addictive. my one complaint is about u need flu credits to continue upgrading some things
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed Gilbert's writing. She is a gifted story-teller and makes you feel  like you're listening to a friend, while reading this book. That being said, I loved the \\"Italy\\" part and sort of skipped the other two. Just not into exotic, bare-foot, ashram and that sort of thing. Otherwise, the book was very easy to read and very entertaining!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|fun game to play reccomend it, definetly worth the 99 cents I play it a lot great fun hard and challenging
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so cool. I love it but its kinds like Mario bros but still this game is super awesome
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|I think people are missing the point of this movie. It's a thing of beauty to see a woman who not only does her own stunts (quite well, I might add), but can also really kick a man's butt. Yes, she can actually do the fights in the sequences. I found the movie to have a lot of action and some very nice moves and take downs by Gina Carano. While the stars like Michael Douglas, etc. only really have cameo roles, it's Gina's performance that you're here to see. While the plot doesn't quite make sense until the end, you'll be rewarded if you stick with it and pay attention. I enjoyed Haywire and give it a solid B- and think Gina Carano did quite well her first time out and look forward to seeing her in more films.
B000MRTGW4|1.0|VERY SMALL TOY ITS A RIPOFF dont buy. i thought it was AT LEAST the size of the palm of my hand not even close how is this worth $5.00???????????????
B004EPZ034|5.0|A very good family movie for all ages, even the kid in all of us. Had Grand-children over, made it a family night wit popcorn and soda's.  Cheaper than going to the movies and lest's talk.
0618001905|2.0|I find modern history writers somewhat incredible when  they only write to Condemn one side over another.  I find  prevalent among history writers who write about America's Indians without examining the inhumane practices of these varrious tribes.  To be fair I also want to know about the slavery, torture, killing and kidnapping these Congolese tribes perpetrated on each other.  The constant condemnation the author intones gainst Leopold looses its flavor for me and actually has the opposite effect.  This author is a guy with a singular point of view out to get those who created our modern societies.  I condemn all torture, rape, killing and slavery..surely these Congolese were not living in the garden of Eden!  They too, because they were human, had to be just like the Europeans.  I despise politically motivated history writing... This book is such an example.
B001IF277K|5.0|not only did i get the origonal oem battery, it was under ten bucks with free shipping and, it came in three days!  I couldn't be any more pleased ...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it really a greatest. game it is awesome game it take take time to figure it out then it really fun
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. As I told Landay; I brought this book on my beach vacation and could not put it down. Even in the  hotel when my bf was in the shower I would read it. He called me a nerd yet I couldn't put it down. It is not my general genre but I found it a page turner. The end was great, I wished I could discuss it immediately. Only two days later did I really think I understood it. I highly recommend it to everyone!
0345803485|5.0|This book is really a good book to read. It took awhile to get the paperback copy because it was on back order. It finally came in and I couldn't put it down!!!I read it in like 3 days. I also read the second one and now I'm on the third one. I only order from Amazon.com because they take good care of you. The prices are great and the service is fast and friendly.
B007DIQC90|4.0|I bought this CD because I love the song \\"Little Talks\\" but none of the other songs contained the brass and as interesting a tempo. It's still good music, though. I hope they put out more songs with the brass instruments, maybe an Icelandic remake of Chicago's style?
