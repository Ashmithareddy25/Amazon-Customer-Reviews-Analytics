B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I'm sure you will love building flying, crawling, rolling  little funny machines, and then crushing them down the creek! Fun, fun, fun!!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|3 bucks for a game, never again. I love this game but it takes so long to download and is SO expensive.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Another fun game by G5! I liked the puzzles-kind of challenging more than hidden objects. Hint button was too convenient way to &quot;cheat &quot; tho.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I find it amazing that this author can make you realize just enough to make you want to know more, but not enough to figure it out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love good sci-fi novels, but some writers are better at the science side than the fiction.  For example, Ringworld (for me at least) was much more interesting in its ideas and world than its plotting and characters.  It's the rare writer who can blend \\"bigthink\\" with interesting characters and good old fashioned storytelling - Neal Stephenson being an example.<br /><br />WOOL is a fun, fast, thoughtful post-apocalyptic read that's both good science fiction, and a well-plotted page turner.<br /><br />Stray observation: parts of this book reminded me of \\"The Machine Stops\\", of course, but also a lesser known book called \\"The Godwhale\\".  Anyone else feel that connection?
B005IQ39AY|5.0|way to pass the time, on the train, bus wherever, can be frustrating at times when they don't give you the colors that you want but all in all worth getting.<br />Much more than just popping some balloons
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|love dragonvale been waiting forever for it to come out best game ever for this type of game great job backflip studios
B0055SWM08|5.0|I cannot believe how addicted to this game I have become, at first it was very frustrating,but after actually taking the time to learn and practice it has become almost an obsession, now I find it relaxing and challenging-trying to figure out all the little hazards and ways the drop moves I find that an hour can go by in a flash because I am so engrossed in this game (I think of it more as a puzzle)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I.bought this app for my daughter.  she is seven and absolutely loves it.  we did have to uninstall and reinstall because of a glitch.  but other than that it has been a lot of fun for both of us.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|how to elaborate any more on the review I wrote for Quell, fantastic game/puzzle, highly addictive.<br />Levels can be played over and over until you can solve in the minimum amount of moves that are posted, I cannot even begin to imagine how many hours I have spent lost in both apps
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book has so many stories going on at once.  It's a fantastic story showing family relationships, survival, sibling rivalry while dealing with very emotional issues.  Warning:  it's a tearjerker!  I loved the book and recommended it to my Book Club.
0553593544|5.0|I read the book, the \\"Bourne Identity\\" by Robert Ludlum. The book is about a man named Jason Bourne who loses his memory and wakes up in the middle of the Mediterranean and his trek to recover that he used to be. However many people who try to kill him obstruct his journey and he must act to stay alive. Bourne meets a woman who becomes his accomplice for the book, after he originally took her hostage. The book is incredibly suspenseful, and well written. This is a book that any reader will find entertaining, and will be a hard book to put down for any stretch of time. Ludlum does a great job by slowly integrating and weaving together a fantastically complex and intricate plot. The plot covers many different countries, and weaves together incredible realizations, and intense action to lave the reader on the edge of his seat, even though it is a book. The culmination of the story is a action packed chase through an apartment building in New York City. However, the book might have some drawbacks in some people's eyes. First off, they might not like the plot to be so complex, instead favoring a simpler plotline. They might not like the style of writing, or the number of character that play somewhat significant roles. However, all in all, this book is a great book to read for anyone looking for an intense action thriller with many sharp and unexpected turns in the plot.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|just sort of boring was not impressed with he  cd at all...did not even  watch it all...would not buy anymore form them
B005Y1B3Q0|4.0|This (Extended Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] The Expendables is fully Scripted and tightly Directed to provide an even flowing action film.
1419705849|5.0|Again for the reader of he family who ha a number of books o his wish list for xmas  fro me
B0035G5IOE|5.0|A Fantastically fun movie to watch with lots of exciting dialogue, action, great country scenery and ways (love the Wolf insert) and get even with the Bullies of the world.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|it was totally awesome and very well done and enjoyed watching the whole tape and friends enjoyed as well...go eagles
1569242739|5.0|I got this book expecting to see just recipes but was pleasantly surprised to see wonderful baking tips about what ingredients do to cakes. I have been making cupcakes for years, and I really appreciated the tips in the beginning of the book and recipes that can be adapted so many different ways! Would recommend this for beginning and advanced bakers.
B002ZG994U|5.0|They kept to the story line and each of the characters where as and better than expected. If they had only done the TV show like this movie and all its aspects, it would have gone down into memory as one of the greats. Alas we have this movie, great see.
B0042C1BP0|5.0|Daniel Craig is a wonderful 007 character.  He has flaws and problems with his boss.  He has skills and a killer instinct.  He kills bad guys and makes no apologies.  He is intelligent and refined, but killing people for a living is no joke for him, unlike previous Bond character-actors.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is the real deal, a natural born killer working for the British Government's M6 division, the best Bond yet.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie as I was expecting the same high quality that was present in the previous series with Matt Damon. At first I had trouble figuring out what the movie was about until I realized how simplistic the plot was - the &#34;program&#34; had to be shut down, and all program participants had to be killed off. That's it.  Jeremy Renner spent the entire movie avoiding extermination. Boring.
B007SGM084|5.0|Just finished reading the series for the first time and am going to start over right now. DON'T WANT IT TO BE OVER!  Such great books and an awesome story!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game, but there's one fatal flaw<br /><br />I had too delete it because it kept kicking me off my game. so I had to delete it and I was a level 20. freezes on kindle fire A LOT.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Probably the single worst film I have ever seen. So many one liners and private jokes came from the first viewing that we decided we had to own it.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I love Stephen King and was so anxious to read this when it first came out.  Having been ten years old when JFK was assassinated, I do have recollections of that time in history.  I was looking very much forward to what King may have portrayed life to be like had JFK survived.  I did not like his rendition of that alternate future and did not feel that it was well explained as to &#34;why&#34; life had turned into that nightmare.  IMHO, not enough time was spent on that alternate future, too much time spent on travelling back and forth to kill Oswald.
B007N8RULO|4.0|FUN. Easy to play. spider solitaire is addictive! However, there is another edition (back ground bright red) that is somewhat more user friendly.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great app and it is FREE!  It is one of the apps that I use the most, especially when traveling.  I can create a list or a note and e-mail to myself if I need to use it for something else or save it.<br /><br />Very happy with this app!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie is a waste of time & money. It's just another shoot em up movie with weak characters and lots of criminal violence.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It comes from the Weather Channel so I figured it was great.  It makes it so easy to check the weather with different options from Right Now, 3 Day and 10 Day forecasts.<br /><br />It is FREE too!
B0060D123K|5.0|My little ones love anything muppets and this one most of all! It's a bit on the darker side when it comes to muppets yet my kids love all the songs!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Ads after every game get annoying. Don't mind them in the beginning of the ap load but after each game feels a bit much.
030759565X|5.0|The hardcover book comes with tons of recipes that aren't on the Smitten Kitchen blog, and the photos are so mouthwatering they make me want to lick the page. This is a great cookbook for someone who wants to make more complicated recipes without having tons of fancy kitchen equipment.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put it down. A must read for anyone who wants to know how it all really went down.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|I LOVE Pitbull!!!!!!!!!!!! Got the new disk the day it came out in stores. It is awesome!!!!!! I was getting very impatient waiting on the disk to come out but it was very worth the wait.
B000K7UG34|5.0|my family and i enjoy the movie.<br />we recommended the movie to our friends<br />we like the movie very much
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it's a great game. My nephew and I play it together. I'm looking forward 2 more games like this. I hope they put together a few more Angry Bird games.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Just another great movie with the heavy men of films. . .<br />The first one was good this one was better. . .hope they make one more.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Movie seemed really great from the previews, but was slow and had a pretty boring storyline. A little more complex storyline would greatly improve this movie.
1481251880|5.0|Fantastic book. Got me from page one and read the whole book in 6 hours. Her ability to capture every womans fantasy of love and seduction is uncanny. Emotionally gripping and simply fantastic.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Had months of trouble falling asleep. Installed this app and I fall asleep within 15-20 minutes nightly. The ability to combine sounds in phenomenal. Personally I use the campfire, water and monks. Love it, thank you
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a good read...Nicholas Sparks writes well and always delivers a good book but they can be predictable.
B007REV4YI|2.0|When this movie came out, I had high hopes for it.  I loved Casino Royale, but didn't care for Quantum of Solace so I thinking this movie just had to be great when I heard/read the reviews.  Went with two other friends who were also looking forward to seeing some major action. 1 1/2 hours into the movie we walked out. The movie was a let down, at least to us.
B0095K9BXI|3.0|The Pirate Captain yearns to win the Pirate of the Year award. Not if Peg-Leg Hastings, Cutlass Liz, or Black Bellamy can help it. The Captain's adventures cross paths with a geeky Charles Darwin, who observes that his parrot Polly is actually a dodo. So it's on to London for a science competition, only it turns out that Darwin isn't the only one after Polly. I love stop animation, and it's beautifully done here. The movie is ok enough, but it's not exactly Pixar magic. Cool soundtrack, with the notable exception of Supergrass. Screw them.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I rented just to see what it was about one day I was surprised that it kept my interest.  It was well written and the way the movie stayed with the timeline was interesting.  I recommended this movie to my son and he too was surprised that it was a good movie well made and keeps you interested though out the movie. Not your typical Vampire Movie I thought it would be some bloody killing frenzy for every minute and it was not.  It is worth the rental
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a very addictive game, to the point of not wanting to put it down... trying to see how far I can get.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great Movie.  Shia LaBeouf was really great in this movie you see a different side to him and he nailed the performance.  My Husband enjoyed the movie and it is hard to get my Husband to watch movies he usually falls asleep, not in this one. I liked the storyline, love story, drama and action.  I have already recommended to friends that this one is a must see.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thought Dr. Alexander really explained what many of us believe, that there is life after death on another plane, and that people have experienced dying and coming back to life as we know it.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|Great movie! If you like some scare definately watch.  Keeps you interested thoughout the movie 5 stars I would give more if I could. I have already recommended this movie to friends.
B00845PT18|1.0|If you are looking for a sequel to the first Ghost Rider, you are in the wrong place. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the first one; the only character that was carried over was Johnny, and even then they completely rewrote his personality. This movie has no storyline, no character development and in no way, whatsoever, does it live up to the first Ghost Rider. Do not waste your time or money losing brain cells watching this piece of trash movie. Just re-watch Ghost Rider 1.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|have gotten addicted to these g5 games.  look forward to the next new ones that come out!  I have kindle fire 2nd generation and have never had any of the problems some people are complaining about. thanks!<br /> Mark. new jersey
B00005QENZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Aerosmith albums. Great hard rock anthems and soft ballads that make Aerosmith a worthy all time band.
B004SBX112|5.0|What can I say.  I'm addicted to this damn game!  It's a great way to pass time when your just relaxing at home.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app! Love the options and presentation. Happy that I have it. Very easy to add more cities.It seems to be very close to the local forecast!
B0086700CM|4.0|It was a very fun game to play for a while, but then it got old.  I still go back to it once in a while, but don't play it like I used to.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great book, action packed and thrilling, can't wait to read the next book in the hunger game series .
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What can I say it's another version of angry birds.  You kill the piggies and go on to the next screen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You could spend seven dollars in total getting several fake rip offs and you will jist me disapointed but this is great and it real.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm not a Mahjong fan, but my wife is.  She plays it quite a bit and says she likes it a lot.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read on nutrition and exercising. I have heard and read articles on bodyweight workouts and this \\"new and different type\\" of exercise style. I have gone back and forth between lifting in the gym and these cross-fit bodyweight workouts. This book sold me on the cross-fit bodyweight program. I haven't touched a weight in 5 months and I a in the best shape of my life. Being in shape isn't about how much you can bench or squat, it's about how efficiently you can move your body weight through space. This book explains this concept and the importance of it. Also, there is a chapter on great dieting principles which is essential to an effective workout program. If you are or have been struggling to get back in shape or are looking for a new challenge, read this book and follow the program and you will surprise yourself.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I played it for several days and decided to delete it from my Ipod touch.  It got old in a hurry.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie, so I can't get enough of this soundtrack. Anne Hathaway singing I dreamed a dream is amazing! Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter do an excellent job singing Master of the House. I recommend this soundtrack highly.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It does what it says it will do, it charges my kindle fire.  What else can I say about it?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it every Sunday, it is nice to have more than one bible app, so you can bookmark one while reading another.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is the perfect DVD set for any Harry Potter lover. The complete set was a great value and the quality of the picture is really good.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|One of the most intriguing and thought provoking books I have read, EVER. I had watched a video documentary that turned me on to this book. GREAT buy!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|It is a very cool gift for anyone who loves the movie. Quality is great and you will definitely not be disappointed.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|My 8 month year old son loves this thing. It's one of his favorite toys and it has a lot of little things that make sounds he likes. It's very soft and doesn't have anything that he might swallow or poke himself with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm glad Temple Run 2 finally came out. It's one of the two things I've been waiting for. The other is for the new Minecraft update to come out. Temple Run 2 is better than the first one because it's more detailed in what can happen, and it's less predictable. Temple Run lovers, Temple Run 2 is out and it's for you to love.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Takes care of all of my files and keeps them organized.  Still learning the balance of the program, have not used it to its full potential.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It does have some special features discs, but i don't need them anyway. The box has five discs(3 movies, 2 extras) and a small book with movie stuff.<br />I'm happy with the product cause it was a cheep and small way to get the tree movies.
B0050I978S|5.0|This DVD is pretty good. I definitely enjoy the anime series quite a bit, and I definitely recommend this to my family and friends. Thanks!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book i have read so far!! Great story. I would recommend this book to anyone out there who likes to read romance novels.
B002R22PB6|5.0|It's good to have a pal who helps you in your darkest moment. It's not moral to forbid or punish it. Courageous movie. I praise it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I mean, damn. This was a really good book. Really relatable to what I've been going through. It's just so beautifully written. And with that clever mystery of who he is writing these letters to. I honestly believe he is writing to himself. \\"She\\" is Sam. \\"She said that you listen and understand and don't sleep with people even though you could have.\\" (Not exact quote) \\"you\\" is Charlie. Because he listens, to Sam and Mary Elizabeth and Patrick, and he understands, and he didn't sleep with Sam even though he could have. It's beautiful.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Collins just kind of went Im tired of writing this let me just wrap it all up. Too much happened, the ending was horrible! The movies will most likely change all of it anyways.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really loved this book! Time to read the others! The imagery got while reading this book always wanted me to keep reading.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first then read the book. It was worth it. Both are awesome. Going straight to start the second book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy on the eyes and to navigate. This app does exactly what it should do and the layout is great.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Excellent, exactly what I was looking for. Perfect condition, fits my needs perfectly. Great buy, recommend to any one who needs it.
0786956291|5.0|I like the set. The player and master books are written so that it's quite clear what to do while playing for the first time. One can easily create a charcter and then go off to a journey.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I enjoyed reading and listening to this book even though parts were hard to understand with the slang spelling etc... over all I was interested in what was going on and pleased with the book as a whole!
B0027ZCQ4E|1.0|Unfortunately it did not stream and kept freezing up. We were not able to see the movie in the 24 hour period.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|When I play HOG type games, I always get excited when there is a letter or map or something that I have to piece together.  Imagine a whole game with puzzles like this!  They start out simple, and move on to much harder.  The graphics are gorgeous, and I love the sound effects of glass or stone or wood, etc, when you place the pieces.  There are 6 main \\"packs\\" (glass, wood, stone, paper, fabric, and metal), with 24 puzzles in each pack.  There is a bonus pack with another 24 puzzles you unlock by completing the other 6 packs.  There is a special Android bonus pack with another 24 puzzles, that I think I unlocked by subscribing to their newsletter.<br /><br />Here are two tips, regarding the bonus pack, and the secret pack.  I was driving myself crazy trying to unlock these two things, and searched all over the internet to find the answers.  I thought I'd post here, to help out anybody else who is stuck.<br /><br />To unlock the bonus pack, you have to complete all 6 other packs, including clicking on the word \\"challenge\\" at the end of each group of 6 puzzles.  You don't have to do the challenge, but you do have to choose it.  I don't like being timed, so wanted to skip these, and was choosing \\"level select\\" instead of \\"challenge\\".  I completed all 6 packs, and the bonus level was still locked.  GAH!  I went back and chose \\"challenge\\" each time, and it finally unlocked.  I guess unless you click \\"challenge\\", it thinks you haven't quite completed the level.<br /><br />To unlock the secret puzzles (the question mark level), you have to do all 4 challenges in a pack, which will unlock one secret puzzle.  For example, do all the glass pack challenges, and you unlock the \\"Drawn\\" secret puzzle.  There is only one puzzle for each secret, and they are (so far) very simple.  Drawn has only 2 pieces.  Fairway only had 4 pieces.  So don't sweat it if you don't want to do the challenges.
B0090YHSFC|3.0|This game is ok. it is annoying but passes the time.  my son is 22 months and likes to push on the animals to listen to the weird sounds they make.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|No spoilers here!<br />I love horror movies and to find one that is actually worth watching is fairly rare. Most are filled with complete stupidity and bad acting. Still I try and do find a few gems. This is suppose to be based on an actual event which makes it more intriguing. We all know that gives a wide license to tell a story which must be taken with a huge grain of salt. I did look it up and they &#34;say&#34; there is a box, but whether you believe in the supernatural or not matters little if you like the genre and can lose yourself in the film for awhile. I did. I like the actors and thought they did a credible job pulling me into the story. I thought the young lady playing Emily did a very good job.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Who doesn't like Dropbox. Easy to use, does exactly what is says it will do and I have never experienced any problems with it'
B008476HBM|5.0|While I haven't read this version yet I seen it for the kindle and knew I had to have it.<br />I love the book, I love the movie (BBC version with Colin Firth), and I love Jane Austin<br />I have to admit that I watched the movie first having avoided the the book for years. I thought it would be to dry and boring. Having seen the movie I had to find out what was left out, so I took the leap.<br />I loved it! I do think that having watched the movie helped. It was pretty well true to the book a few things left out. I did find some parts a bit dry and the speech awkward and don't think if I were younger would have had the patience to move thru it. It is good and definitely worth the push.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|This is one of those games that lets you play a while and then says to go to the next level you must purchase the upgrade. I transport foster children long distances so I keep games on my tablet so they don't get too bored. Found the charge on my account the other day and ran it down to a child that was playing it and didn't reralize what he was doing advancing to the next level.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|I take quite a ribbing from some of my family members for the sparkling, fangless vamps and the werewolves that aren't, but I still like the whole series. I have always loved vampire and werewolf stories(I blame my 2 big brothers!) Usually I'm very traditional with these things and don't like the changes so many new stories come up with. I like the 3 bites and blood exchange to convert, the stake thru the heart and cut off head and the no sunlight rule. I resisted a long time and actually watched the first movie before reading the books, then I was hooked!<br />I found and interesting progression with the movies each one being better that the previous. I don't think they expected such a reaction with the first movie and each one shows the development of the actors and the money spent on the project.<br />This one showing the most detail. The CG effects are fantastic. Bella really looks like she is wasting away. I think the acting was very good. The teen angst and all. Bella finally being strong enough to be what she wanted despite what others thought.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|this is one of the best shows on tv right now.... if you have not seen it yet... you are truly missing out.... so get on it and check it out... oh and LANA PARRILLA IS AN AMAZING EVIL QUEEN!!!!!! TRULY THE BEST....... so happy with the casting and the show in general, but they could not have chosen a better a  actress for the evil queen... Lana Simply put is FANTASTIC!!!!
B00A50PDDY|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this CD. It's irresistible!... once you get over the initial weirdness of a few rapid shifts within some songs. The first time I listened, I was like, wha...??? when that happened. Like, can they do that? And what would that even look like, in notes and time signatures and all? And, is that like wearing camo shorts with a Hawaiian shirt? But now, I love those spots. I wait for the shift, or the interrupted phrase, anticipate it, beat the steering wheel, smack the air. I play this disc over and over and over and over and over... And I'm usually one who craves variety. But there's plenty of it, just within this one CD. Love the lyrics. And the concerts... Go. Words cannot describe.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|My husband recommended this title<br />as he loves mysteries. It was a good read & full of surprises.  I didn't guess the ending at all.
B004J64QSI|2.0|I almost bought the blu-ray version of this, but settled for lower resolution. Oops. Detail is not good in the dvd version.
B001NS063E|4.0|I'm picking up some of the old stuff still, (forever), and I always liked the first two albums, overall, track by track.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I love this movie, and the Criterion presentation is perfection.  Great picture and sound, and wonderful extras. Highly recommended to moviegoers with patience and imagination.
B00328R21C|5.0|It's exactly what you see on the box.  It's nice that it comes with a lot of Star Wars characters for my grandson
B0067R0APK|5.0|As accurate as it gets.  Good data, good graphics, great all around program. Enjoy browsing the world's weather! Love the colors.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Love this movie, heartwarming, and great movie to watch with the family.  Great movie to watch on a Christmas Holiday.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is unlike any other book I've read on near death experiences. It deviates from the usual senario in many ways. The author, who is also a physician, utilized his medical background to dispute any plausable explanation for his visions. If you are interested in the subject of life after death, this really is a must read.
0307476464|5.0|Still working on finishing this, but it's incredibly evocative and thought provoking.  I read a little bit most evenings, and it transports me into its surreal and twisted universe.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|This was a no brainer for me because I am a 30 year Red Hot Chili Pepper's fan. I put off reading it until now because I didn't think I really needed to know every detail of Anthony's life.  I was wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed his story. It helped me better understand those close to me who battle addiction and appreciate their struggle.<br /><br />If you like Anthony Kiedis, you will absolutely love this book.  If you don't, I think you will still respect the way he takes absolute responsibility for everything in his life, good and bad.
B008VSKPJO|5.0|Imelda May's most recent release of August 2012 is nothing short of spectacular, and destined to be a CLASSIC.  There is nothing this beautiful and classy woman can't write and sing.  Imelda May's vocal ability is highly versatile and there is not a single female vocalist today that matches her powerful and emotional singing capabilities (Patsy Cline had this as well). Her music is currently classified as rockabilly, but I am at a loss for a true one-word description because she and her incomparable band create music that crosses so many styles of the past & present.  I refer to her music as &#34;Imeltame&#34; because that is what it does!
B00899E5B4|4.0|Joe Walsh is still Joe Walsh.  Heavy on the guitars, humor in the lyrics.  I especially like the songs &#34;Family&#34;, &#34;Analog Man&#34; and &#34;Wrecking Ball&#34;.  It's nice to know that some of the heroes of my youth are still young, but have managed to mature at the same time.
B002KV8NQ0|5.0|A gem from Imelda May.  She is perhaps the best overall recorded female vocalist of out time.  Very reminiscent of Patsy Cline and similar to Leann Rimes.  I hadbnever heard of her until September of 2012 when I initially viewed the live DVD Concert, \\"Jeff Beck's Rock'n'Roll Party...A Tribute To Les Paul\\". . .this DVD can only be described as 'Pure Magic'.
B007BFSYMS|2.0|I was excited when I saw that this was the free app today as I like this sort of thing a lot and purchasing all of the different ones to find the right one can be a bit daunting. However, I was a bit down by the fact that there seems to be no way to play more than one sound.
B009CG96QM|2.0|I believe every act of goodness and kindness will have a positive effect somewhere sometime, although the persons committing the act may never see the results of their actions. And the same is true for mean and evil actions, they amplify negativity in the world.<br />&#34;How can it be that watching two and a half hours of violence in a movie will have no influence on our behavior but a 30 second Super Bowl ad is worth 3.8 million dollars because it will make us run out and buy a product?&#34;<br />And on top of that Brad Pitt, who I generally enjoy as an actor, could not pull off the good old boy role at all!<br />I would have given this movie a single star, but I watched this whole movie to see if there was going to be any redeeming value at the end. There was none. It only serves to increase the sum total of evil in the world. Don't waste your time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|History buffs will love this book. You feel apart of the families. Could not put it down and can't wait for next one!
B000SOYEQY|5.0|Was fabulous 50 years (or so) ago and it is still fabulous today. An epic film in the days before computer generated backgrounds. It was my most memorable from high school days. Hadn't seen it once since then. I found it even more moving all these years later. Only downside is that something is lost by not being on the big screen in &#34;Cinemascope.&#34;
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I have been telling all of my friends about this cd.  Classy, easy listening, words can be understood, I can just go on and on.  This is a great cd.  I will be checking Amazon to see what's next for this great artist.  I just accidentally heard one of her songs and had to have the cd which didn't disappoint me at all.
B008EQIJQO|5.0|This movie is worth seeing for a number of reasons, but watch it, if for no other reason than to see the scene where she is imagining herself being caressed by his empty coat hanging as it hangs on the coat tree. Pure brilliance in directing and acting!
B00ANT6OK8|4.0|For what it is, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a solid recap of the events that ultimately led to the death of Osama Bin Laden.  However, the story is told in such a clinical tone that it fails to be a true classic.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, this movie begins shortly after 9/11, when Maya (Jessica Chastain), a government agent, is put on the Bin Laden hunt.  After briefly teaming with interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke), Maya branches out on her own and begins an almost decade-long hunt for the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks.  The movie culminates with the raid on the compound in which Bin Laden was hiding.<br /><br />There are indeed many \\"positive\\" experiences to take from this movie.  It isn't over-the-top, which can always be a bit of a concern when dealing with such \\"real\\" topics, and I believe it strives to portray the events as close as possible to how they actually occurred.  As such, there are controversial scenes of torture, as well as an incredibly suspense final campaign to root out Bin Laden from his fortress-like compound.  It is just a very gritty film very similar to director Kathryn Bigelow's earlier work \\"The Hurt Locker\\".<br /><br />However, this film is severely missing the \\"human touch\\" that any film needs in order to truly be great.  This is a very clinical, stoic re-telling of the hunt for Bin Laden, almost completely devoid of any derived dramatic component.  While, like I said earlier, this is usually a positive trait in films, this time I believe it was taken a bit too far.  In order for me to truly rank a film at the top of the heap, I need to be able to emotionally identify with the characters and their circumstances.  In this case, that just didn't happen, and as such I dock it one star.<br /><br />Overall, though, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a taut, intense tale of great historical significance.  Though missing some key emotional components, I have to give credit to Bigelow for tackling such tough issues and still managing to produce a viable film that isn't hackneyed or pandering to politics.le film that isn't hackneyed or pandering to politics.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, do it. It's great. Excellent acting. Excellent action. Delightfully 80's soundtrack. Give these beautiful sons of bitches a hand for a beautiful movie with a polished feel and gritty action,
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I almost hesitated buying this when I heard a few reviews describing it as &#34;Mellow&#34; and &#34;Techno&#34;, but my love of Muse prevailed. This was a great purchase and it is infused with so much texture to the music that it deserves the multiple listens I have given it. In my opinion it is the best album of the year from one of the best bands to emerge in the past decade.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|this software says it does some pretty cool stuff....provided you have a TV that can interface with the software.  other than that, watching stuff on my phone rocks.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was my first Stephen King novel and I was blown away. This book has everything you could want and is written with great talent and attention to detail.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Have seen this flick before and wanted the blu ray edition for the farm.<br />A great movie. Fills a guys need for adventure flicks, even has a hot chick in it :&#62;)
B0035LGXXO|5.0|The Warriors, a gang from Coney Island, attend a gathering held by Cyrus to create a truce, along with every other gang in New York. Cyrus is killed during the speech, and the Warriors are framed forcing them to fight their way home. The Warriors is an iconic, adrenaline-filled brawler.<br /><br />The Warriors has a straight-forward story; easy to follow and efficiently told. It moves at a consistent pace and blends brutal fistfight brawls, baseball bat duels, edge-of-your-seat chases, and more; basically, it has a great variety in action which keeps the movie going and avoids repetition. This is a film with plenty of memorable quotables; from \\"Can you dig it?!?!?\\" to \\"Warriors, come out and play\\", this film is unforgettable. The acting was good, the music was excellent, great cinematography and choreography for the fights.<br /><br />Overall, The Warriors is an amazing action film. Definitely a must-watch for fans of film in general. As of 1/19/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended.<br /><br />The Warriors has strong violence and blood.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Rather boring as far as sci-fi space travel stuff goes.<br />Would be a great saturday morning cartoon show.<br />Sounded loke a good premis but not well executed.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is Classic Kiss, but takes the next step forward after \\"Sonic Boom\\". First, I have to admit, that it is a bit different. Paul's songs for instance are a bit on the serious side. He doesn't really have 70s styled fun, tracks on here. But his songs are very good nonetheless. My far and away favorites are Eric's song - which was written by Paul - \\"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\\" \\"Out of This World\\" by Tommy, \\"Wall of Sound\\" from Gene - which is just a real cool riff, and Paul's \\"Long Way Down\\". To me, the Eric and Tommy songs provide those fun, classic rock songs with catchy hooks, riffs and choruses. Gene's stuff is great, but much heavier than on \\"Boom\\". Paul is heavier too. \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" is a great track, but to me it's more in the \\"Creatures of the Night\\" style - which is not a bad thing. Lyrically, the album is more serious and thought provoking than before. My favorite Paul track, however, may be the bonus track \\"Right Here, Right Now.\\"<br /><br />Give this at least 5 listens before you judge it. It grows on you. Musically, it is great, they put a lot of work into this and it shows with how tight they play and you can tell they are having fun.<br /><br />What bugs me?<br /><br />1st - \\"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\\" - should be a radio hit. I don't get it. With the crap on the radio - why<br />  that can't break through is beyond me. Oh well. I love it.<br /><br />2nd - The timing of this whole project - I give Kiss a C-. I love the album - but they toured over the summer with<br />  Motley Crue before the record came out - okay....then they tour South America as the album comes out - so<br />  there was no promotion for it here in the US. When \\"Sonic Boom\\" came out it was so much fun. I bought Kiss<br />  M+Ms, Posters, T-Shirts at Wal-Mart, then went to see them in concert that week. They were also supposed to<br />  put out Kissology 4 - and haven't done that either. To make matters worse - In Feb-March of this year - they<br />  are headedto Australia. Oh Well. I still love \\"Monster.\\"
B00AESN8XY|5.0|One of the most interesting and addictive touch simulation games I have encountered on the new kindle. I may be a little partial as I find Biology!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|I'd lost my old copy & bought this to replace it. So very pleased. Like watching it for the first time all over again.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|A beautiful and deep retelling of the Snow White story that spends more time on the back story of the villain than it does on the heroes - which helps the audience to empathize with the Queen (though it stops a good bit short of making you root for her).  While the story definitely relies on some pretty generic archetypes, the cast does an excellent job with what they're given to work with.  Meanwhile, the visuals do a perfect job of making this &#34;fairy tale&#34; seem grounded in reality, if not exactly our own reality.  Well worth watching!

B005CKPQNE|5.0|Very enjoyable experience to be able to view several shows at once.  Well worth the price.  I watched several episodes more than once. Pinkman and White are fantastic.
B004K4GDE4|4.0|However the record sleeves are poor in design and the interior of the album leaves one wanting more. Buy for sound not for a good LP experience.
B008XCPO2Q|5.0|I don't see how Channing tatum didn't make it in that line of work!!! Not a movie for anyone under the age of 18 in my opinion

0896898288|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas gift and liked it so much I bought three others to give as gifts. It is well-laid out, easy to read and has a lot of ideas for quilt blocks whether you are going to make just one or the whole sampler quilt.<br />The blocks range from easy to difficult. If you are someone who might enjoy reading letters from American farmers' wives in the 20s or just someone looking for quilting inspiration I would highly recommend this book. It comes with a CD of each block design's instructions.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|this book was OK but it only kept my interest to about half way through. If you already know the real life story and what the outcome is, the book gets a little boring with chapter after chapter of her ordinary day to day life with her abductors.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|The information provided by Taubes is overwhelming and sometimes I found myself skipping pages to get to the essences of the ideas. Overall this is is a really informative read.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Before we ordered this DVD set I had never seen the film colorized. In fact, we almost didn't watch that version at all- but I am so glad we did! While I love the b&w seeing it in color made it so that you noticed things that didn't show up in the b&w version. Especially people's faces that were slightly behind the person in front. It made many of the other characters shine more and thereby deepened the film. I highly recommend purchasing this set- we loved not having to wait till Christmas Eve for it to be broadcast!
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good game. It's free so I won't complain about their need for energy to keep playing. I like it so far and it is a good time passer. I think they use energy  to keep you playing.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Great especially if there are a few wi-fi networks nearby to choose from- great addition to a Kindle Fire HD.
0553288105|5.0|I found an old copy of this book at a hostel while traveling. I know of Asimov but this is the first time I've read any of his works.<br />From the first page to the last it was engaging and beautifully written. The alien story arc was incredibly well thought out and Asimov trust that we will understand what he has created without needing to spoon feed us. Although the aliens are based on a now outdated system of Freudian psychology it doesn't diminish from the originality of the story or in any way impair the plot.<br />I cared more for the human characters than I have in any other book I have recently read. Highly recommend.
B00004CXYO|3.0|I'm happy to have it<br /><br />I do not like changing the region to watch<br /><br />I would order another movie for the same price
B007BFSYMS|3.0|There are many choices of white noise but was disappointed at the sound quality from the KINDLE FIRE HD. The app could have truer sound quality
B007VUA7VO|4.0|colorful and easy to understand. all around a well made free app. I am seriously contemplating getting the full version
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Has all the elements for good sci fi; cool technology, hot leading lady, an android, and a cool &#34;what if&#34; plot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  Very will done by the producer and set managers.  All set in 1918 through 1921 currently and the sets, scenes, dresses and acting are superb.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Works great and has more levels then my IPad version. Still have not been able to beat all levels but have gotten several very high scores on the ones I have completed
B00B47NO2O|5.0|The Following was amazing!! The whole plot line had me hooked from the opening. Definitely any fan off murder/suspense shows will enjoy!!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Very good for a free game some times the graphics overlap hard to tell if tiles are locked or not.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Time flies as you read this page turning book!  Great from the beginning to the very end!  This author is still the KING of another dimension.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This novel brings a fresh view to the time of the sleeping king and the York Boys. It is intriguing because of the blatant disagreement with Gregorys previous novels.
B00A8SPNYW|1.0|My Infuse 4G (1.3.6) couldn't handle something in the intro and it locked during the intro graphics.  Unplayable for me.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I watched this with my husband who said he would just sleep, but ended up watching it. We both laughed through it.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Trying to make a decent platformer without buttons can't be an easy task. Bean's makes a valiant attempt, and is mostly successful, by always jumping, the need for a jump button is removed, and we can focus on the more easy to manage &#34;left&#34; and &#34;right&#34; control.<br />That being said, it didn't compel me.  Not the games fault I don't think, I have yet  to find a platform scroller on my phone that holds me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was taken off the air because of low ratings. (I think the networks did not do enough to promote it).<br />Do your self a favor if your a si-fi fan, buy this set. You will be very happy you did.
B009FXIICK|3.0|I didn't understand how all of the specials worked, that could have been better described.  Otherwise this is a solid bejeweled clone, and I like it at least as much as the original.
B002N9MK8G|4.0|I do not own an array of Rat Pack CDs or songs.  Honestly it is not what I care to listen to.  But hearing Sinatra, live in his time and his prime, is something else.  It's a very neat CD.  What you'll get isn't just ole' blue eyes crooning his way through the crowd, you'll get him in his element, for anyone who knows Sinatra knows he was a capable drinker, so what better venue than at a Vegas Lounge?  He jokes with the crowd as well as his backing band.  He'll tell stories about his fellow Rat Pack members Martin and Davis, and even let the crowd in on him.  That's what this album is, a collection of songs, yes, but really it all flow together as a &#34;Get to know Sinatra&#34; album, which is pretty neat.  Times have changed, music has changed, but hearing something like this just puts you in a sort of time machine.  Being able to close your eyes and nearly feel like you're sitting in that wrap around pleather booth, smoking a long slim, and knocking back a shot or two of your favorite liquor.  Life used to be much simpler I suppose, and sitting here listening to this album, you may just get a sense of what it may have been like.  At least at the Sands.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|...imagine if Angry Birds had had less polished design and graphics.  I think slice Ice is almost awesome.  Good use of a touch interface, good play mechanic, good specials.  Good use of the 3 star system.  Lackluster &#34;story&#34; and visuals... they are good, but they aren't a home run... it could make the difference between my having this still installed on my phone next year, or remembering the name of it...
8866130915|5.0|I have an iPhone and am trying to move to a digital calendar but I cannot give up my pocket Moleskine. It is a great calendar, plenty of room to write notes and events. The size is perfect because it fits in any purse, and it holds up the entire year.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I really enjoyed Renner's perfomance, he may have been better than Damon.  The love thread was believable too.  The part where he remembers what he was like before the program is maybe 2 minutes long but the most powerful part of the movie for me.  nice Job Jeremy
B003DNN0L2|5.0|my kids loved it they watched 2 x in a row even my teens 14 and 16 enjoyed it along with their 4 yr old siblings..great buy for a great movie!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I couldn't put the book down without reading for hours at a time. The words described in a way that when you read each sentence, the images were already created.<br />I think this book is a five star book because of its detail, it's surprises, and quality.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|The warthog is great and I love the figures. The Forerunner structure isn't good for much but the rest of the set is wonderful. You get two Spartans, an Elite Zealot, a Sticky Detonator, a Spartan Laser, an Assault Rifle, a Covenant Carbine, and a ordinance pod, pretty good I say. The Warthog stays together real well and I love the rubber tires. I really love the figures too, they're well decorated, and because they are now made with a slightly more rubbery plastic, they hold poses better.<br /><br />  The stickers are sort of tricky to position just right and  most of them lay across two or three block seams, so if you ever take it apart you'll probably lose those stickers, so if you think it might get taken apart just save those particular stickers on the sheet for something else. Also the gun has a tendency to spin all over the place and wiggle into a crooked position a lot without a figure on it.<br /><br />  All in all a great set, pricey a full retail but really fun to play with. I mean, what's a Halo collection without a rugged Warthog to get your Spartans where they're going?!<br /><br />  I love this set and I can't seem to stop rolling it around on my work desk at least a little each day since I got it, it's just that cool.
0399226907|5.0|I read this little book to my Reading Group because the subject for the day was &#34;Children's Books.&#34;<br />My sister-in-law taught first grade for 30 years and told me it was a children's favorite/
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Tried reading it before the movie came out, but didn't have enough time.  I was subbing at a school and the teacher had a copy of it on their desk, so I started reading it on my break. I couldn't out it down and knew I had to purchase a copy as soon as i got home.<br /><br />I can now see what my friends meant about how the movie wasn't as good as the movie (due to a lot of the story having been thoughts and memories Katnis is having.)  The movie was really great, and the book is better than the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Through the first half of this book, I found myself highlighting and re-reading portions that jumped out and sent such emotion that I thought it would become my new favorite book. I instantly fell in love with Hazel. Her attitude and outlook on things was sarcastic but so utterly truthful. I just love a book where the wit and hilarity can become an inside joke between friends who have read the book as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the last half of the book, I thought it became a little overdone. There were several instances when I didn't believe what was happening. A few scenes didn't seem to further the story...more like filler than forward moving action. At times, it felt like things were being tied up to quickly yet when I turned the page on the last chapter the story still felt undone.<br /><br />I am left with mixed emotions about this book. I did enjoy the story and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys finding humor in situations that are not so humorous.
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Four stars because I could not put the book down.  Most books by Ken Follet are great page turners and  informative, who cares about his style of writing ?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You can't just describe your experience with this trilogy without giving away the delight of this proliferating journey.<br />Please enjoy at your own risk!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Very good story. As usual I was able  to follow  step by step the detective work. No cheating there, solid story line.<br />ALso the different characters in the life of Harry Bosh are very credible and well constructed. (his delicate relationship with his partner for instance makes me tense, just reading it. It adds interest to the story)<br />Connelly never disappoints.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I read my bible every night. This app has really cool reading plans and you can choose what bible you want to read, whether it's NKJV, the old version, etc.... Great app.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was remarkable and the best book I had ever read its mysterious and has a lot of action .
B0044KU7KU|5.0|This is a very good MCR CD. I bought it for my girlfriend and ripped in onto my computer. Its up beat with an interesting DJ theme.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Ok so it's a bit childish, I mean we all remember this from when we were kids, for right? I gotta tell us tho for some reason it is oddly addicting. I find myself going to play it first thing when I pick up my kindle. So, for a fun flashback, go for it!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This is an AWESOME book! U should definitely read it!! There is a real cliff hanger at the end! :)
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I am definitely a music fanatic and can't thank you guys enough for this creation. Thank you JRT Studios. I have had many music apps before this and finally someone has done all of us a justice. Now I am going to see what other apps JRT Studios has out and see if I can use any of them. Thanks again JRT Studios.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|At first I wasn't a fan of this book but as I got deeper into the story I found myself dropping my mouth as I read! I definitely recommend this book even though it isn't the most modern or cool choice ;)
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Old Mans War is a fast, intelligent read. The plot s simple, but the world Scalzi has created tells a bigger story. The characters are likable and the author does a good job of helping us understand their new world. As I read the follow up books, I am compelled to reread this one to find all the nuances I have missed. I highly recommend.
B002PJ8AE2|4.0|Nice car.  Packed so well, I had a hard time unwrapping it. Grand daughter loves it. Open trunk would be nice addition.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|Feels real and smooth and sweet, with no allegiance or musical agenda but what James is feeling and thinking. Great beats.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Well written like  the other 3 but tied up a little too neatly for my taste. But great series overall.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I learned a lot about the Pacific Crest Trail and enjoyed Cheryl's experiences.  She writes from the heart and holds nothing back.  This isn't a pure hiking/travel book but has more about Cheryl's life before the trail in it.  That wasn't as distracting as you might think, and it was almost necessary to understand who she was on the trail and why she was on the trail.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great story and strategy game.  makes you think through the puzzles and &quot;found&quot; objects although wish i could skip ahead of the game's thinking or use some items more than once.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Book was suggested by a friend. It tells the stories of people who were able to leave North Korea. I found it easy to read and I was amazed to learn how the North Koreans have been living.
0451232852|3.0|I'm torn in how to rate this book. On the one hand, I ripped through it . . . I even found myself at work tempted to pull it out of my bag and furtively read it at my desk.<br /><br />But I feel pretty confident that does not make it a 5-star book. The tale is engaging, if unnecessarily far-fetched at times. But the characters are just a little hollow and the moralizing too one-sided for any serious student of history. With the 100th anniversary of WWI coming up next year, I've been on a bit of a Great War kick. While greatly overshadowed by WWII, I have come to believe that WWI contributed far more to the creation of the modern world we live in than its successor. So I will admit that my view of Fall of Giants is colored by the book I read immediately prior . . . A Farewell to Arms. I know it is unfair to try and compare Follett to Hemingway but the books do stand in stark contrast to one another. Follett tries to be everywhere at once, from geography to society. Hemingway does the opposite. He focuses on a small corner and now largely forgotten corner of the war and builds it around two otherwise insignificant people in a sea of insignificant people. But the character development by Hemingway makes that a great book. The characters ARE the book. Follett uses his characters as simply a means to an end . . . to tell his grand (and entertaining) tale. In my humble opinion. what Hemingway's approach requires genius. What Follet's approach requires is diligence and competence. Not a bad thing in this world of many irredeemable and forgettable novels, but not great.<br /><br />One other stone in my shoe through the 1,000 pages is Follett's political moralizing. To be clear, I neither particularly agree nor disagree with Follett's championing of the common man over the rich, powerful or status quo.  He could hardly ignore the rise of the Bolsheviks in Russia or socialism elsewhere in Europe during the War and post-war period. But his touch is so heavy, so clumsy, that italmost puts the reader off. Of course there were bad people who were in favor of the status quo and heroes in trying to overturn the system. But it certainly wasn't all one and all the other. Life is not black and white . . . it is some shade of gray. The hue of that gray is generally filled in by the biases of the person who looks. One would think that in 1,000 pages, Follett could have added a little gray into his painting along with all the black and white.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|I decided to purchase the full Mistborn trilogy on the strength of the many positive reviews the story received. While the first book, The Final Empire, is a fun read I found it surprisingly superficial. I'll try to outline my thoughts without spoiling the story.<br /><br />More readers today are familiar with fiction labeled in the young adult (YA) category. The most popular series was undoubtedly the Harry Potter books, although by the time Rowling finished the series, she was really writing for adults. The Mistborn books, at least the first one, aren't even really young adult fiction. The target audience here are really book-loving 3rd through 6th graders. The vocabulary is incredibly simplistic, the characters stereotypical, and the plot filled with holes. I found it difficult to avoid rolling my eyes at times.<br /><br />The setting is a dark, feudal society ruled by an immortal dark lord called the Lord Ruler. The protagonist, a Mistborn Allomancer named Kelsier, aims to overthrow the ugly social order and kill the Lord Ruler. It's a good premise and the book does a good job of creating a clever magic system and numerous heroes and villains with interesting characteristics. Unfortunately, each character has less depth than the last. Kelsier is nearly invincible, cheerful, brave, selfless, kind, handsome and friendly. His only character flaw seems to be that he's just too darned charismatic.<br /><br />Vin is a teenage street urchin raised in a brutal environment who discovers that she also is a Mistborn Allomancer. Vin is the most relatable character and also the best example of some of the character shortcomings. She's been starved and brutalized her whole life yet, within a matter of weeks, becomes conveniently transformed into My Fair Lady. Barely surviving in a life of nearly illiterate squalor evidently is the perfect training ground for her to flawlessly infiltrate the nobility, becoming the immediate paramour of the most powerful scion in the kingdom. Better yet, she's resourceful. After a pitched battle with another Allomancer and a full squadron of guards and archers from which she barely escapes, Vin somehow manages to retrieve the ball gown she peeled off before the fight broke out.<br /><br />There are lot of moments like that in the Final Empire. Characters appear to save the day, in the nick of time, without any explanation of how they knew where they were needed. For example, Vin's steward saves her, at one point, on the roof of the Lord Ruler's castle. Later a rather contrived explanation of how he knew where she was and how he got on the roof of the heavily guarded castle is retrofitted in. In another instance, Kelsier's brother manages to infiltrate the highest level of the Lord Ruler's ministry in a matter of weeks. He's just so awesome he goes from entry level to executive management in no time. Evidently the Lord Ruler isn't big on background checks. Also, despite the fact that this empire is supposedly run like Nazi Germany, Kelsier and his crew somehow manage to recruit, train and quarter a 10,000 man army without anyone noticing.<br /><br />Now, if these are the kind of plot points you can easily overlook, you might really enjoy The Final Empire. The book has its charms. It's a very quick read. However, as a work of fantasy fiction, this is a lot closer to the Chronicles of Narnia than Game of Thrones or Harry Potter.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It's great to be able to hear our music purchased from Amazon on all our devices. This sure beats the alternative solutions.
B00138J234|5.0|This seminal rock album should be one everyone's must-have list. Innovative, hard-driving, but also extremely accessible & &#34;catchy&#34;. I am only sorry I never saw these guys live back in the day.
B006HAJ99K|4.0|It was enticing with moments of sheer delight.  There is great compassion between two lovers but little money.  Then the idea of how to get money, but leave each other for the pursuit of money.  What happens end the end must not be reveiled now.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|After all my efforts to source this product in India failed, I decided to purchase this from Amazon.com. I received the shipment in a week. And in line with the feedback that I had seen about the quality of sound, I must say it is simply amazing. I have listening to The Beatles from 1980, but listening to these CDs was a mesmerizing experience for me. Thank you Amazon.com
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As always Corey keeps you laughing with Kate to keep him in check. Book was a little slow to start but a good read nonetheless.
0375851569|1.0|So, most people would think right off the bat that something is wrong with me to give Dr. Seuss a one star review on the Amazon. I'm sure some folks are reading this and already shaking their heads in disgust. Well, there is an old saying that goes something like this: \\"The greatest trick the devil ever played, was to convince the world that he didn't exist\\". I feel that mentality can be applied to my review.<br /><br />I bought this set for a close friend. She had recently gotten divorced and she and her son were on their own. I was secretly trying to play my cards right to wait for a perfect moment of vulnerability so I could start to put the moves on her. I figured the best way to get in good with her would be to act like I liked her kid. I don't have any offspring of my own, so I was kind of in a pickle when I tried to decide what I could get the little guy. So many cool toys out there these days. As I browsed through all the possible gift ideas, I ended up getting even more overwhelmed than I was before. There is also the issue of what would constitute an appropriate toy. If I spent too much money, my friend might get wise to my alternative motives. If I didn't spend enough I might look like a cheap skate.She  wouldn't want to hook up with a guy who was going to be a financial liability.There is also the issue that some toys may seem to violent, or some toys may not have enough educational value ...etc...etc. I was really starting to get discouraged,  when all the sudden an idea came to me. Books. What parent wouldn't want their kid to be into reading? I know when I was little my mom was always trying to get me to read. I hated it though, not enough action for my little attention span. I would get so ticked off when I would get a book for my birthday or Christmas. The sinking feeling in your stomach when you think you're going to be getting a Nintendo game or something, and then you find out some POS relative or family friend decided to get you a bunch of stories,or fairy tales. I would always hold a grudge, and when the opportunity for a little payback would present itself, I would pounce on it like Rosie O'donnell at an all you can eat buffet.  I would egg cars, destroy flower beds, stuff like that. Anyway, I'm getting off track.<br /><br />So, once I decided books would be the angle of my deception, the only thing left to do was to decide on what books to buy. As I said I was never a huge fan so I had no memories of reading anything that I liked. The only books that I could remember were the ones about the Berenstein Bears. I'm sure some people are familiar with the bear family that lived in a tree. There were two kid bears, and a papa and mama bear. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. See, I had always viewed mama bear as quite the pessimist, as well as the most incredible nag ever. Every book that came out seemed like she had to take the roll of the wet blanket in the family. Each book had its own theme, whether it be the bears eat too much snacks, or the bears go on vacation, or the bears learn how to share (I'm sure these aren't the actual names of the books, just what I remember what they were about). No matter what the situation, the plot was always the same. The kid bears and the dad bear would get into some sort of conundrum, and then the all-knowing, wise mama bear would come in and fix everything. God I hated it. She always ran her mouth, blah...blah...blah.. \\"I told you so papa bear\\". I don't know why he put up with it. He was probably getting some side action from \\"secretary bear\\" at work or something. Really, who could blame him? Probably the only outlet he had to keep him from throwing her out of their tree window! Obviously I didn't want to get the kid all worked up like that. Especially after his parents just got divorced, he would have ended up blaming the separation on his mother. Then I remembered something. A little story about \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\". Dr. Seuss...queue the light bulb goingoff in my head! That's when I got on amazon and found what I thought would be the most effective aphrodisiac since oxycontin and whiskey.  Within a couple of days the package arrived and I was on the way to \\"Check to see how they were holding up\\" ;)<br /><br />The kid and his mom both loved it! I guess some of the classics in this set were his favorites. Unfortuneately he had lost many of them when his dad came home one night from the bar and relieved himself all over them. I will never forget that look she gave me. Not only was I a great guy,but it was like it was an omen from the good lord himself. I won't go into the details but I will say this, the kid calls me his uncle now since sometimes I'm still there in the morning when he wakes up!<br /><br />So things were pretty good for a couple of weeks. After that I started getting bored. I wanted to break things off with her but at the same time she had quite a few hot friends. It was like a magical oil well that never went dry. If I ended up having her upset with me, I knew that there would be no chance for me to get with any of her buddies. A very complex situation to be in for sure. I figured that I should stick around a little while longer. The only problem was that she started to ask me to watch the kid when she had to work or run errands. Like all the sudden I'm the baby sitter or something just because we knew each other in the \\"biblical sense\\". The fact that I am so nice has always been a curse for me, and this time was no exception. I quickly became the kids' nanny. At first it didn't seem like it would be that bad. I would go over and order some movies off of her pay per view. Sometimes I would order pizza or Chinese food from the cash that I would find in her hiding spots around the house. Well, no matter how much you try to ignore them, kids can be very relentless in trying to gain your attention. When I put the kid to bed at six o clock in the evening he stated to tell me that he wasn't tired yet. I would tell him that it wasn't my problem and that there was noting that I could do about it. He didn't like that answer at all. He finally convinced me that he would go to sleep if I read him a story. I figured it was a fair trade and asked him what he wanted me to read to him. He said there was a Dr. Seuss book about people who ate butter on their bread on opposite sides of their slices. I thought he was messing with me, but sure enough when I looked through the books I found the story he was referring to. I told him to get comfortable in his bed while I went to grab a beer. I sat down in a chair next to his mattress and started reading the book.<br /><br />In my entire life, I have never come across any liberal propaganda that could top the stories that Dr. Seuss wrote. I went through the story about the butter and bread people and found a theme that tried to illustrate the senselessness of the missile crisis. The author attempted to portray the world wide threat of communism, seem  as trivial as eating butter on the top or bottom of your bread. Most people think \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" is a story about trying new things and the importance of not judging too fast based on first impressions. Not me. I think the old coot was secretly saying that everyone is the same and that race and sexual oreientation doesn't matter.  He chose the color green to throw people off from his alternative motive. Had it been \\"Red Eggs and Ham\\", or \\"Yellow Eggs and Ham\\" everyone would have known he was sympathizing with the Native Americans and Orientals. I don't think I even have to get into \\"The Lorax\\". If ever there was a story that would be a favorite of Al Gore, it is that one.<br /><br />The other thing that really got me upset with these books, was the fact that the guy has been called a genius because of his writing. I can't even begin to wrap my mind around that! The guy comes up with a lame theme, and then basically he writes page after page of gibberish. Since when is it considereda talent to make up words so they rhyme. How much creativity does it take to say something like, \\"The sneetches had lots of weeches because they built there homes on beaches.\\" It's like when snoop doggy dog started putting \\"izzle\\" after word as a suffix. At least he had some rhymes in his songs that were actual words in the English language. Give me half the money that Seuess made with his books, and I will be more than happy to spark a doobie and spew out nonsense for several hours of the day. Afterwards I would also be called a genius.<br /><br />So, unless you want your kid to pursue a career as a gangster rapper, or become a huge tree hugging liberal, I would stay away from this set of books. If Dr. Seuss was still alive and writing today, I guarantee he would be creating a story right now about some made up society that discovers gun control is the best thing in the world. I bet he would be an Obama/Biden fan for sure. Take it from me, this man was a fraud and his writing has tainted America's youth for too long.uld tell him that it wasn't my problem and that there was noting that I could do about it. He didn't like that answer at all. He finally convinced me that he would go to sleep if I read him a story. I figured it was a fair trade and asked him what he wanted me to read to him.

B006OV7RQ4|4.0|Did not think I liked this movie at first, but days later I found myself still thinking about it.  I revolves around a girls who escapes from a cult and must return to a normal family setting.  She does not adjust well and wonders if she made a mistake returning to her family.  She has a lot of adjustment problems.  The director put the movie together in such a manner for the events to permeate the subconscious, good job.

The binding is very good; the cases that hold the actual DvD are of better than average quality; there are pictures, themes, and other readings in the various covers.  My youngest daughter also enjoys the Godfather series -- she saw my collector series and that was it.  I presented it to her as a present at Christmas.  Super product!

B000S1M9LY|5.0|The only drawback to reading the novel has been the weightiness, and the need for two bookmarks while looking up the hilarious footnotes. With the price of the eBook under $5, there's no reason not to own one of the best books of the 20th century!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was just what I didnt know I desperately needed, like a flaslight/bottle opener/pocket comb.<br /><br />&#34;The Martian&#34; is a technically sophisticated and well researched yet hilarious account of an astronaut stranded on Mars. It has been too long to remember the last time a book made me burst out in actual spouse-startling guffaws. I looked forward to reading it more than having a personal six pack after a neighbor's cat funeral.<br /><br />Good job Andy, now don't go out and screw up the next one by getting all high-school English class on us. Your formula works.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a great book since it discribes, as an interview the different steps that led to this crises and how the world handled them. The blunders seem to real and the book connects the stories very good.

B0091REZMW|2.0|Fun and addicting, particularly if you enjoy games that involve interaction with other players online, but it is full of bugs that have become very frustrating. I've discovered after multiple requests for help on certain bugs, that Game Insight generally brushed off the issues and told me to wait for future updates. There have been 2 updates since I began playing, 1 of which deleted all my progress and forced me to start over, and the 2nd which didn't resolve anything but instead added more bugs.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Really surprised Mark Wahlberg was in this film.  It only had a few funny moments but was mostly just nasty trash.  I hated it and wish I had turned it off and not wasted my time but I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did.

B008MU8ZOI|4.0|My only complaint has nothing to do with purchasing it, that is always good.  I was disappointed that the distributors decided to crop the image to fit it to widescreen televisions (16x9) I have this on DVD and it has the entire picture. Oh well. Still love the movie.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is t he first Prestonand Child book thatI have read. I truly enjoyed this book.Very enjoyable and a fun read.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I gave it 5 Star Rating because it was non-stop action. Its a truly real to life action series. You can relate to each one of the characters in the series & almost feel as if you are right there with them through this whole ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had is how many episodes they had in the first season compared to the 2nd season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|better than other horse games by far. more realistic, and more activities to do with your horse. fun game. love it.

B00ARW2XJW|2.0|the reading on the thermometer for inside is not accurate. i'm not sure what it uses on the phone to read the temps, but if i'm holding it to start the app, it reads a different temp then when i have it on the desk.
B005KJZDW6|5.0|If you like She & Him, and/or Zooey Deschanel's voice, or Christmas songs you'll like this album. It fits nicely in our growing Christmas LP music collection.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I never intended to own a Lana album, but when I previewed the track listing for this set - I was blown away! I got this set for Christmas and it is really amazing. I have read other reviewers comments about missing track listing, but mine seems to have all of them there, but it was purchased at a shop in Canada. I have a lot of favorite songs, but the absolute best ones are \\"Gods and Monsters\\" & \\"Bel Air.\\" Very few songs that I dislike, but I would say \\"Cola\\" is my least favorite. The only thing I noticed that was different about this album was the track for \\"Yayo\\" sounded like a different version, not sure if I like it better or worse, it would have been better to include two sung versions of it. Anyways, great album to listen to and relax, definitely go out and buy!!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It is like League of Legends but for the kindle fire. All I can say is Gameloft did it again.
B008NW67E0|5.0|The overall rating compared with the awesome amount of reviews sums it up pretty well I guess. An album full of little gems (except maybe for The Boxer).<br />Whether you like it or not will depend on your taste predominantly.<br />Unlikely that you will find better folk rock anywhere else from such young musicians. This band has got it all. Especially Mumford himself is an unconcealed talent.<br />Already I'm looking forward to follow ups from the band for it's been amazing so far. I like the Babel album more and more as it runs along.<br />Highly recommended!

All the complaints, that you may have read about, concerning the lack of compatibility or performance glitches of this UK Edition, when played on the US Play Station 3, I have 'NOT experienced!'  Again, don't be fooled.  This UK Edition [HD], sold on this site, amazon.com, will play just fine on the US Play Station 3 [PS3].<br /><br />DOWTON ABBEY IS BRITISH DRAMA AT ITS BEST!  Bottom-line:  Downton Abbey is one of the best British non-comedy mature drama series I have seen to date!  Exquisite continuity!  A true masterpiece.  An amazing achievement!  A real 'feather-in-the-cap,' of what we Americans have long come to endear, and learned to expect, from the grand legends of early 20th-century Edwardian British aristocracy - nobility, integrity and honesty.  Brilliant!  Respectfully and believably juxtaposes the intimate cultural integrity that \\"follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants during the reign of King George V.\\"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downton_Abbeyile you wait to decide which episode you'll watch; listening to those seemingly unending single keystrokes from that piano;  each note, four counts, four notes, measure after measure, with unabashed intent, like the coming of a juggernaut - even though grouped into two measures two times.  Gentle suspense, with such delicate twists and turns, immaculately orchestrated...  As if..., having been benedicted and embraced by a heavenly-sent permutation.  This is what we have all been waiting for.  A true masterpiece.  An amazing achievement!  A real 'feather-in-the-cap,' of what we Americans have long come to endear, and learned to expect, from the grand legends of early 20th-century Edwardian British aristocracy - nobility, integrity and honesty.  Brilliantly, respectfully and believably dramatized.  For our mutual pleasure - on both sides of the pond.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love this app.  It is so interesting and informative.  They always have new and exciting things on every day.
B000FC11A6|3.0|Interesting but could have better continuity and stronger ending.  To be fair, i did set it down for long periods.  My intellectual son gave it to me so maybe i missed something.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was swept away with the first page!  It's not very often that a book makes me smile, laugh out loud,and cry, but this one did!
1416550550|5.0|I picked this book at the local used bookstore for a reasonable price. I'm not sure what attracted me to it, other than perhaps the artwork on the book cover, and then when I flipped thru a few pages thought it sounded interesting. I almost put it back, but decided to keep it.<br /><br />It is a rather thick book, 549 pages. On the front it says that it was a New York Times bestseller, but to be honest, such reviews mean nothing to me. The back of the book in bold, describes the story as \\"A novel that takes the reader on an unforgettable journey through generations and across continents as two women try to uncover their family's secret past.\\" Essentially a little child is abandoned on a ship headed for Australia in 1913. She arrives with only a small white suitcase and a book of fairy tales.<br /><br />All I can say is wow. This is another book that I started and found it difficult to put down. Any spare moment I had, was spent reading. Lunch breaks, long baths, anything to keep the story going. The story starts off the Nell, the little girl who was found abandoned at the ship docks. A man finds her, and takes her home. No one ever comes to claim her, and his wife, who had recently miscarried was more than happy to keep her. She grows up happy, until on her 18th birthday her father tells her the truth. That she wasn't their birth child. That in turn sets the stage for the rest of the book. Her quest to find out who she is and why she was left abandoned on the ship.<br /><br />Even sitting here, the book freshly closed behind me, I'm recalling details of the book. It sends you on twists and turns, especially when you are in the midst of finding out what happened. The story starts off in modern day, but then various voices are picked up. Three generations are found in the dialogue, however while initially it seems unnecessary, you soon discover that you are eager to read more. Delve into why what happened in another dialogue.<br /><br />Very well written, suspensefuland sad, yet joyful. Rich with details, every piece having a place in the story. It's a book that I will be passing off to others to read, with the understanding, I must get it back. It is a book that I will be reading over and over in the future.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I suggest reading this as soon as you have finished the previous book for better continuity and understanding.  It will keep you reading to the end.
1451695195|2.0|I picked up this book in hopes of finding some shred of evidence that would convince me that an afterlife is even possible. I found nothing here. Certainly as a neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander knows that the brain is essentially uncharted territory. Couldn't his recollections of \\"heaven\\" have been merely microseconds long, while the brain was shutting down or re-booting? Haven't there been instances where those in a deep coma remember conversation while they were \\"unconscious\\"? Though the author tried to offer possible explanations, he failed to convince me in the least he visited heaven. I see his experience as no more than a dream, a trick of the damaged brain. There was simply no convincing evidence given to warrant the book's title. The writing was OK; the arguments failed completely.

B004Y042N8|3.0|It is about solving a puzzle by tapping on the dots to draw the lines without retracing a line already drawn.  The puzzles start off easy then get harder.  The only problem is that it would not let you select a puzzle.

0385535147|5.0|The storyline plot is unbelievable. I strongly suggest you get a CD or audible book, so you can just listen or \\"read\\" and will not look ahead of a page. The storyline goes frm thrilling to semi-boring to gripping in cycles. But Grishambounces back when you think it may be dragging and pulls of a tremendous punch. If you have watched lot of big Bollywood hindi movies, the plot is eerily familiar.<br /><br />Absolute fiction, I really thought is the storyline true because Grishamuses real research a lot. In the end he says, everything is hardcore fiction. Excellent novel in my opinion - I won't be surprised if Hollywood makes a movie out of it. Legal system, Corruption, Murder, Big Money, Fugitive,  Prison, REVENGE, FBI, All are here!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the graphics are very nice and the game is easy to play. Haven't played it long enough to say anything more
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|It was a quick read, which I definitely enjoyed. It also kept me reading the entire  way through. I love books like this. Dexter is an incredibly interesting character and I can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|i watch all the stargate movies and series. i didnt know what to expect with this plot and new cast, but it was fabulous right from episode one of the first season. the second season gets even better.  cant say any more without giving away plots other than i was so upset when i finished the last episode and there was no more.
B005LAII80|5.0|The Stallone version is reason this film did so poorly in theaters.  The previous Dredd incarnation was an albatross around this movies neck.  I've been a Judge Dredd comic fan for over a decade and I'm thankful someone made the effort to honor the source material.  Pick it up you will not be disappointed.
B002V091IO|4.0|I loved the charters in this story, they felt so life like and relatable, I often found myself laughing at the things Emma Moore would say to life long love dexter. This book is incredibly well written and thought out. A nice easy read for all.

B007JU5HSO|3.0|Any Tangerine Dream alumni worth their salt who sees the words Edgar Froese, followed by Solo, will likely chuckle quietly and shake their head. After all, the soloing skills of the founding T Dream member have usually left alot to be desired, compared to his peer instrumentalists of the period and genre. Both on the guitar and the monosynthesizer, his solos are consistently clumsy, confused and simplistic. The majority of the tracks feel as if, after constructing a wonderfully rich and complex musical playground to frolic in, he's desperately riffing on the spot, struggling to stay in key and on time, and 2 bars in he can't think of any more notes. As if any desire for artistic prestige was cast off in favor of simply being the kid with the most toys who toured the world showing them off.<br /><br />The soloing skills of Mr. Froese are not the reason to buy this album compilation. It rather is his mastery in programming his plentiful machines, creating mood and atmosphere with them, in what generally feels like a live performance composed on the spot, without the need to riff off of two other band members to accomplish it. Numerous patterns and textures are pieced together like a massive audible jigsaw puzzle or collage, and then the simplistic pentatonic soloing just becomes another layer. The early work in particular are strokes of psychedelic mastery that transport the mind, much like their T Dream counterparts do. The latter work is more melodic and structured, particularly the final entry, Pinnacles, which I enjoyed the most of the latter category.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews here about the material in this set, the printing mistakes, the cheap packaging and what was omitted and added. The excellent mastering work by Virgin has likewise been repeatedly praised. So I will simply say that for the asking price, so long as you are a fan of the ever-evolving sounds and ideas produced by Tangerine Dream, prior to their degeneration into an embarrassing debacle of commercial mediocrity around 1986 that continues to present day, you will likely enjoy these similar sounds along their sonic journey, albeit in more of a less ambitious prototype state here in these tracks.bacle of commercial mediocrity around 1986 that continues to present day, you will likely enjoy these similar sounds along their sonic journey, albeit in more of a less ambitious prototype state here in these tracks.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|First thing you notice when you take it out of the box is its sheer weight and quality ,feels like holding a piece of railroad track lol but while still being a very aesthetically pleasing knife , pretty much the glock of knives.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|Good old fashion black & white movie with a good story line. My family and I watched this movie and we all had a grand time answering questions from our preteen grandkids about Santa Claus.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I don't know,but he is one big ass something.Temple Run is the greatest running game tablets phones and whatever mobile device has ever seen.One of the best captivating games on the market that attracts all ages.And now it bares a child.<br /><br />Temple Run 2 welcome! Its been a long wait but you are here at last.And you live up to your predecessor, probably even better.TR 2 has brought in a gorgeous scenery ,much improved graphics and it has gottten more challenging with new obstacles :zip lines,weird cliffs that look like you can keep going but you fall off if you don't moves swiftly to the left or the right,one big angry thing chases you,flowing rivers can sweep you away,big spinning logs with spikes the size of Babe Ruth's Bat,and more.But with improvement there is a downfall,loads of IAPS which can easily make a novice of the game into a &quot;pro&quot; by making a few quick purchases and you are on top of the leaderboard.<br /><br />Pros:Much improved graphics,captivating and beautiful scenery,more challenging obstacles,and user friendly when it comes to controls.And powerups ,except one .<br /><br />Cons:Too many IAP's,and the ability to &quot;respawn automatically if you have enough coins or green gems.I like the oringinal's way of you having to get &quot;resurrection wings&quot; to keep going but in this one its too easy to keep on running without spending coins or having the instinct to know when to put on those wings.<br /><br />Overall:I know this review doesn't really matter,people are going to get this game and it going to be on the leaderboards on every app store no matter what I say or what others say.But I wrote this to inform you before you jump in.Thanks for reading.

0375869026|5.0|This is by far the best YA novel I have read, and this is coming from somebody that actually took a class in this type of literature. This book had me cry, laugh, cheer, and wish that I was personally in the book itself! This of course coming from a grown man! The only thing I want now is either a sequeal or maybe a series of books written about Auggie. I did not want it to end.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game as a way to relax. Addictive and entertaining as well as easy to play. I give it five stars. Thanks for the game.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|I was told to read this book many years ago and now I see why. It sparked a lot of ideas in my head of what I can be doing differently and to improve my current situation. I bookmarked a lot of pages.....now I just have to find the time to implement some of the strategies.

0385040253|5.0|This volume is one of many reference books which I use with the local scout troop.  It is consice and easly followed.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|While the story was very imaginative and fast-paced, the actual execution of \\"Ready Player One\\" left much to be desired. Cline comes off less as (what I have to assume he aspired to be) an author and voice of the times, but more as a fan-boy with little maturity or cultural sensitivity.  Characters are completely under-developed and one-dimensional, when they aren't playing off of outright stereotyping (see 'Daito' and 'Shoto,' the two Japanese characters in the story, who do nothing but inanely bow and talk about \\"honor\\" and taking revenge). Not to mention the heavy-handedness in Cline's portrayal of emotion, or sweeping social statements that he certainly thought were bitingly clever, but actually come across as immature and insensitive -- My favorite example: Cline's insinuation that the solution to the inequalities faced by women and minorities in the world is for women and minorities to pretend to be white men (p.320). How compassionate!<br /><br />\\"Ready Player One\\" would get 4 stars -- no Gatsby, but a great book with a compelling story -- if only Cline hadn't written it.  His writing, in my opinion, nearly ruins it. Game Over.
B00011D1OA|1.0|The movie cannot be seen without commentary!  I saw no option on the menu to just WATCH THE MOVIE. Very perplexed as to why this would be.

B004SIP7US|5.0|Great acting and super lineup of stars..Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal .  The action and it being a true depiction of the 5 points in NY
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After seeing the movie Lincoln I bought this book. It is superb in every sense. I thought that our current congress was about as nasty as it gets... not so. I really have enjoyed learning about Lincoln, Seward, Chase and Bates. This is a great book that goes far beyond the film.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Who dosn't love a great murder mystery. The story is great. Love to watch with friends or alone. The clothes the era,the manners.Makes you wish you could have lived back in those days.

B0072GPQNG|2.0|too much atrocities,death, cruaulties.the 'happy ending' is chidlish.But at least it shos how all animals are mistreated and abused during war,horses,dogs .
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Didn't really care for this one. Effects were ok, but the story could not hold my attenion.To many of these movies are to a like. I hope kristen pick a better script next time.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|It's a great GPS watch, and much smaller than the earlier models, but it is still rather large. Also, the &#34;one size fits all&#34; heart rate monitor strap definitely won't fit a petite woman, so you'll need to order an XS strap from Garmin. My only complaint is the sensitivity of the touch toggle, if you sleeve touches it it will change the screen, and the &#34;stop/start&#34; buttons won't stop your timer unless you're on the training screen.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Nice to see if they are not a problem with that of the threat and the other hand I have been in business for the next 40 years

B003N0XDT4|4.0|The freq response is better than my on board sound..<br />But I don't know if I'd honestly know the difference in most cases.<br />When I listen for it in a tone generator I can hear it produces better lower end sounds.<br />I wish it were soley powered by USB instead of just being charged by USB..I know the battery will die before I'm done using it. I personally don't ever use it on any portable devices, its a PC only soundcard/DAC. I rarely use portable music, let alone want to bother with carrying this device on top of my portable device..
034580404X|5.0|I think my title says it all!! Best trilogy ever!! If you're looking for some fun I strongly recommend this trilogy!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints!  He keeps you captivated from cover to cover with a little love and a little adventure!  Love this story!
B008MM9630|5.0|I suggest spending a little bit of money, they have some specials you can purchase when online. However, you CAN have a bit of fun even without purchases. (Just be careful not to spend too much.)  :)  Seriously, overall it is fun and relaxing...time your crops so that you get away from it for awhile, for example, if you want to focus on your real world job, plant something that takes 4 to 6 hours to grow, then harvest and check on things during a break...plant things that take over 8 or more hours to grow at night, then you can harvest in the morning.
1595822003|5.0|The artwork in this version is amazing and beautiful. I bought it because I remember how jealous I was when my much cooler friend got it as a gift when we were kids. I was hoping when it arrived it wouldn't be a case of mistaken nostalgia. Fortunately the artwork was just as beautiful as I remembered it was, and of course the story is a classic.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for storing all your important information.  If I worked and wanted to have all my notes in one place, Kindle and computer, it would be great.  Nice program.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First book I have read by Gillian Flynn and it won't be the last.  Interesting subject matter, presentation and it hooks you right away and is difficult to put down.  I'm not quite done and can't wait to see how it ends.
0375805621|2.0|I was hoping for a quality sequel to the original &#34;Monster at the end of this book&#34;.  Not so.  It is pretty dull without the exciting build up of the original book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|First off I want to clarify my device so other reviews know if they can trust, I run a kindle fire not he he version which I have read has problems with aime apps. Anyway the alarm is great and completely adjustable, aime complaints were they weren't loud enough, do what I do download a song using freeyoutubedownloaded( use the mp3 function) then set that and try not to wake up especially if its something loud and upbeat. another complaint was you have to leave it on,  now I dont know what they mean by on but sleep mode works but everything shuts off with a full shutdown so you'd have to be dumb to think if it was shutdown it work. other then that I don't see any other problems people had for the kindle, I love the alarm it works very well.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I like how many different sounds there are and I like the quality of the sounds...can't wait to try them out tonight when I'm going to sleep I think it will help a lot.  thanks!

B008B3H4VQ|4.0|At first ill admit i was a little skeptical when i heard they had switched styles again.  But the album is actually pretty good.  You can feel the emotion in the songs in a way i never expected.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|After three viewings of the film, it was wonderful to have the highlights album because you can actually hear the &#34;acting&#34; in the voices.  This is not a recording for the music purists any more than the live on set recordings from the movie were.  But for those still holding the powerful pictures in their mind, these versions can still bring you to tears.  Unfortunately, some of the most important songs are missing and the shortened versions of the songs used might not please some.  I will look forward to a complete edition of all of the music from the film.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|People either love or hate this book. It's well written and thought provoking. It does bring up a lot of emotions and memories from those insecure days of being a shy teenager.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book and everyone after it that after I listened to the audiable I had to read read them. I could not get enough....<br />  Very beautiful story and one that some of us know how they feel....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Enjoy having this app for use to see what the temperature is immediately.  I will recommend it to anyone to use daily.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I do not know why people get inspired by complete opposites, but I am one that is inspired by things in this movie more than all his other movies. why complain about something that is part of all his movies, I watched them all and he has the same details in all of them, but this movie has the captured beauty and music to go with it that fills me with realistic visions of these rich cultures.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book would be ok for 17 to 25 year olds fails to hold attention in the early stages and seemed a bit adolesent at times. good twist at the  end. I think this author will produce some good books in the future this one was not really for me
B0084U0IEG|3.0|A good book to discuss (book club)... the main character is so emotionally detached from herself, strange.  The other characters are a little more interesting but the storyline just follows Serena's relationships around the UK.  The impact, to me, is a choppy story and as a result the book moves awkwardly towards a conclusion.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The book is a quick read and very interesting. What she went through is unimaginable. She is one brave lady.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|i like the book, it was hard to put down.  Any dog lover would really like it.  I also liked that it was set in the Northwest.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun. It can keep me occupied and it's neat having a horse to care for. If you like horses, you'll love this game.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|If you love reading about our nation's wars, With the Old Breed, will not disappoint.  This is a first person account of the Marine Corps' battle with the Japanese at Peleliu and Okinawa.  Sledge's account is extraordinarily vivid and one that you will not easily forget.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Love, love, love this cd!!  I have listened to it 100+ times, and can't wait for more new musci from Slash!!
0765325950|1.0|I have read the wheel of time multiple times and have listen to the audio books even more.  This ending sucked.  The end just happens no explanations on the major plot elements just \\"this\\" happens and that's all you get.  Cliff hangers that were set up in the last two books are not resolved at all.<br /><br />There are two ways a series ending can be called bad to me, either the plot is bad and it has a bad ending (ie mass effect 3)  Or what is happening is fine but there are so many plot holes it makes it unreadable.<br /><br />I am aware it is supposed to be kind of an open ending where we don't know what happened.  This is not the case.  Inception had an open ending this is just bad.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i was the First 2 Download it nd Forgot to rate it lmaoo anyway Download This Game and keep it on 5 star so temple run 2 Can pass Temple run
B005DJREJS|1.0|Have tried repeatedly to download to my ipad, will not work.  At this point it was a waste of my money.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|I started to accumulate songs on my new Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;, and noticed that I had no songs from the Rolling Stones, one of my favorite bands I purchased and downloaded &#34;You can't always get what you want,&#34; which is one of my favorite Stones songs. I still love it. If you are a Stones fan, check this out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book couldn't be further away from hopeless!!  It gives you the drive to just like, love and LIVE!<br /><br />I love how detailed and descriptive Colleen Hoover is with this book.  And it's not just the normal descriptions of the characters and backgrounds - it's everything!!  I needed to the feel the emotions of both Holder and Sky and I did.  I was them - they took a part of me but left in that place is a part of them.<br /><br />This book deals with some tougher issues but it's how Sky and Holder handle them and get through them that just blows me away.  I love all the intricate small details that Colleen adds because it's what makes this book come to life - it makes it real.<br /><br />Sky is just perfect - no other words to describe her.  The ways he reacts to things and how she lives her life.  Nothing extraordinary or exceptional - she just is and that's perfect.  Holder is spectacular and so emotional.  He takes my breath away with how powerful he is with his feelings.<br /><br />This book has impacted me in ways that I can't put into words.  I was hooked from the first page and was just amazed at how quickly this book ended.  But everything in between is what brought on so many emotions and wouldn't allow me to put the book down.<br /><br />Read this book no matter what you prefer.  It will touch everyone!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|What a great movie and to know this is based on a true story is inspiring.  There are funny moments, sad moments, dramatic moments, all of the above.  I love the beginning and how the movie goes 'full circle'.  The sounndtrack by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam is 10 out of 10 as well.  Well done!
B00002N9ER|4.0|These flashlight holders work well but could be a little more substantial in build. Light must be taken strait out of the holders. Any sort of angular pull could cause breakage.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Reading this book again in the Kindle edition was fun. I paid attention to different plot twists and details this time.
1594744769|4.0|This was my last real read of 2012 and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />First I just want to start with why I wanted to read this book:  Simply?  It looked creepy.  I didn't know too much about this book other than a few details I picked up from reviews, and what the cover looked like.  For the most part this book didn't disappoint on the creepy front.  From the very first chapter to about a third or so of the way through I had that awesome tension feeling between my shoulder blades. It was almost as if I was waiting for something to jump out at me.  The feeling was probably enhanced by the fact that I read most of this book in the dark... adding to the \\"ambiance,\\" if you will.  And then I hit the middle part of the book.  And that is where I felt the story hit sort of a \\"slump\\" in the plot.<br /><br />Once Jacob finds Miss Peregrine's home and the children the story sort of plateaus.  This is also where Jacob learns a bunch about the home and the children, more specifically he learns about how they can still be alive.  It's called a loop and that's basically all I understand about it.  I tried rereading this section a few times... and I still don't 100% understand how it works.  I gave up on it and have just come to terms with the fact that it does.  Perhaps I'm the only one with this problem (which wouldn't surprise me) so you can ignore that as an issue.  The other problem I was having was trying to determine how many children were actually at the house.  It felt like a lot (in my head I had been picturing about 20), but at the end it sounded like there were only 10.  This was probably another detail I may have overlooked (sometimes when I read books quickly I miss minor things like this... /sigh).  But back to the idea of the \\"slump\\"?  The novel just slows down.  It's almost like we're taking a nice leisurely walk before the action picks up all at once at the end.<br /><br />Though I had these issues all is not lost!  I really enjoyed this book!  I swear!  And I think that's all due to Jacob and his grandfather's relationship.  See, I really loved Abe (Jacob's grandfather)... and I was very sad that we didn't get to keep him longer.  The book is propelled by all the questions surrounding his life, so I understand why we lose him so soon.  I just loved the process of Jacob unearthing his grandfather's past, and I loved finding out more about the man we barely met.<br /><br />Then there's Jacob.  Sometimes I loved him... sometimes I found him a bit whiney.  I also had some problems with how he viewed his family (though this is coming from someone who is very close to her family so this was an issue on more of a personal level regarding relating to the main character).  At times I felt his feelings were a bit unrealistic... and I couldn't believe he could detach from his life to easily.  But so it goes.  Characterization-wise it makes sense (even if I couldn't personally relate to him).<br /><br />Lastly there's Emma.  The love interest.  Another part of the story I'm torn on.  See... there's a sort of a love triangle in this novel... but there's a twist.  It's between Emma, Jacob, and Abe.  Which is why the insta-love/like/interest between Emma and Jacob was a bit awkward and weird for me.  Emma loved Jacob's grandfather when he was at the home.  So... it felt a bit weird for Emma and Jacob to be instantly attracted to one another.  I felt there should have been more conflict from both of their sides (Jacob half thinks about it before basically tossing the issue away).  Though this love issue exists, I love Emma as a character.  You're introduced to her suddenly and she's just so head-strong.<br /><br />Once you get past the middle a lot of exciting things come to light and those things pick the novel back up on its feet again.  Tension, excitement, danger, and creepiness come back in to play.  You go from a nice stroll to a sprint.  There's a really nice twist near the end as well, one that I honestly didn't see coming (which was really nice since I tend to be pretty good at predicting things).<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention before ending this review are the pictures included in the novel.  I think they're so neat, and that they add a lot to the narrative (let alone the creepy-factor).  It's hard for me to believe that these pictures (for the most part) are real (though I suppose that's the point).  Sometimes I think pictures can take away from a story, but in this case I really enjoyed them and didn't feel they were disruptive.<br /><br />Even though I had a few issues with this novel, overall I really enjoyed it.  It's a lot different from what I normally read, which was why I was so excited to give it a go.ich was really nice since I tend to be pretty good at predicting things).<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention before ending this review are the pictures included in the novel.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a quick read and I could NOT put it down. Loved it! I immediately called all my girlfriends to see if they had read it! I might have to read it again!
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This Book is so good. The book is simply about two teenagers falling in love with each other while living and each dealing with a terminal illness close to everyone in one way or another : cancer! They have many journeys and different views on life. The book relates to many people as everyone knows someone who has or had to deal with cancer. Everyone should read this tear jerking novel which is also heart warming and funny all in one:)
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love this book.  Although I am mostly a non-fiction reader, this book is very well written and has me totally engaged specifically being written from Death's perspective wihch is unique.  I recommend this book.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Great read, worth creating the immersion reading with the book. Nice to hear the pronunciation of some of the rabbit words.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling's HP series is my all time favorite, but I did not go into this book expecting it to be another HP novel. I knew Rowling intended this to stand alone, so without those expectations, I could really enjoy the novel. I did enjoy it very much! Getting through the first hundred or so pages is difficult because there are so many characters to set up, but when you start recognizing the names and plot lines the story moves faster. However, even when things felt slow, I couldn't help but be awed by the wonderful storytelling and precise description Rowling uses. She is fantastic writer and even if you didn't like the book, you cannot leave without appreciating Rowling's gift as a writer.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing definitely keeps my CPU cool.<br />I just built an all-new PC and I didn't want to subject my nice new CPU to the torment of a stock cooler. This definetly keeps the temps in check even when playing demanding video games.<br /><br />Worth every cent!
1423101499|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson series. I only recently started reading the books, and it's obvious that I'm addicted to them. The fourth book was not a disappointment. It was full of action and humor. I loved how Annabeth and Grover once again played large parts in the storyline. I was missing the old trio, but was happy to have Tyson tagging along too. I think I like this book second best, right after the first book, \\"The Lightning Thief\\".<br />In this book we find a little bit more about Rachel, who was barely introduced to us in the third book, \\"The Titan's Curse\\". I don't want to give too much away, but I'm glad that the author didn't just forget about her and actually explained some things that were a little fuzzy at the end of the third book.<br />Most of the books end with a BAM, a giant cliff-hanger ending. I was reading some of the reviews they printed on the back of the book and one mentioned a cliff-hanger. This one didn't really have an epic conclusion. It was too neat and tidy for me. It needed a little oomph.<br />That's all I can really complain about-the ending. Other than that, I loved the book. I'm sad to know there's only one book left for me to read, and I know I'll miss Percy, but I'm itching to get my hands on that fifth book right now. Ah, well.<br />\\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\\" gets 5/5 stars. Read it-now! But read the other books first. =]
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My 7 year old son loves the game so much! I think it's pretty fun too :o) it is easy and fun for everyone.
B002APU580|5.0|Have been a Pride and Prejudice fan for 20 years, this is the best remake yet!! My sister and I literally call each other up and say I need P&P therapy...  We curl up with wine snacks and pop it in. Great cast, Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden are a perfect Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are a hilarious Mr. and Mrs. Bennet...<br />Best chic flick ever...
B00A81MV3U|5.0|It seems that often when we go to the movies we are expecting something. Sometimes maybe our expectations are too high, but each film strives to send some kind of a message. Too often films will fail in their attempt; these are not always bad films. I would argue that sometimes really good films fall a little short. Nevertheless we will go to the movies expecting to have an enjoyable time. A film does not always have to be great to have an enjoyable time. But when the credits role and the film has played our hope is that we got something out of it. I myself always want to have some kind of takeaway.  If I don't have a takeaway I believe that film was a failure regardless if it was well-written or well-acted. A film I just watched has everything I look for in a film, and that film is Silver Linings Playbook.<br /><br />Silver Linings Playbook is a rare kind of film. Some may ask why I feel this way, well sit back and I will tell you. I don't always like films that are about life in general because too often they do not portray anything I have seen about life and where life takes you. However, to me Silver Linings Playbook has a true ring to it. I am really noting like either of the main characters as I am neither bipolar or a 20 year old widow. But I am someone with a lot of life experience and the message in the film is clear. Too often we hang on to the things that have broken our hearts. Broken hearts are really part of life, everyone will experience heartbreak in their lifetime there is no way around it. My experience with heartbreak would usually come if I felt something was missing. When that something is missing we strive to do every thing in our power to get it back. But I remember something I heard in a Best Picture winning film just a few years ago. By the time we get done chasing what is gone there is more going out the door. Sometimes the thing we are looking for is standing before our very eyes and we refuse to see it because a broken heart makes you blind in many ways.<br /><br />I don't want anyone to be discouraged by what I am saying and think this is just another sad cry your eyes out film. It is not one of those films at all, I will be honest I laughed more than anything else. It is a film where you can laugh, cry, and even be inspired. There is a reason for the first time in 31 years this film is nominated for every acting category at the Academy Awards. It is a wonderful film, and don't just take my word for it. Many say the same thing so if you are wondering if you should see it then wonder no more!nd in many ways.<br /><br />I don't want anyone to be discouraged by what I am saying and think this is just another sad cry your eyes out film.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Bought for the Kindle Fire..with one hit of the button..it was there instantaneous... Great buy. Would recommend for the romance reader.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My daughter loves this movie ahs was so excited to get it, the price was so amazing i could never find it this cheap in the store
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. I recommend it<br />Probably not great for kids though. I would say this book is appropriate for high school students
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. it is very entertaining. I play it every single day, even when I'm not playing the game is still running.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Galaxy Note 10.1, only real drawback is the app only displays in portrait mode, MY tablet was made to auto-orient to landscape and is the native display mode for this and most pads. Seems to be pretty good quality sounds. Also hard to figure out how to exit, have to pause music then use back key. Should just be able to Back out.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Live in the Denver area so the first time I saw this movie was on DVD.  Good movie, probably my favorite of the series.  Too bad I didn't want to go to the theater to see it.  But somehow it seemed a betrayal to the people who were hurt or killed to go see this in the theater.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have just started playing games on my kindle. This is a fun game you can play without spending money!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Enpendables 2  Very funny movie.  Lots of action.  they rip on each others movies.  Funny to watch such a group of older men.  Expendables 2 great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game, I would say between graphics, sound, and play, it is one of the best games, I have downloaded. Only concern, i have yet to get past a certain level, more reason to like playing!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I watched the 2hr Pride & Prejudice (Matthew MacFadyen & Keira Knightley) about 7 times before I just HAD TO have MORE!<br />Next, I watched the (approx) 4hr version (Jennifer Ehle & Colin Firth) 3-4 times before I HAD TO HAVE MORE...<br />Then, I read the novel & drank it in (it did not disappoint!)<br />So when I came across this it was such a treat, as I now knew the story inside and out. What a stimulating interaction between a reader & her beloved story characters this is! She knew the story inside & out, as well. :)<br />It was a wonderful adventure and I loved it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The graphics are great and the game is just a lot of fun.  I'm addicted.  The fact that it's free was an added bonus.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The 1st thing I have to say is I can't believe I got this set for 19.95. You get every movie on blu ray, plus some pretty cool special features. Only thing I wish the set would have had was digital copies besides that is it a awesome collection and worth the money.
B000957O7S|5.0|I think every family should own this movie. Its funny, sweet, and makes everyone smile.<br />Also the fact that it arrived in 3 days made it so much better.
B006H5120E|5.0|its play good and the right color and plays well so i like the product very muchand i also like the movie
B002G917ZK|4.0|It was fun for me to watch such an old movie. It also left me saying &#34;Darlin&#34; to everyone for a couple of days.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|It is helpful to watch every version to get a fuller understanding of the story, but I enjoyed these actors the best.<br />The only version I did not care for AT ALL is the most recent one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written and I just couldn't put it down.<br />I highly would recommend this book to people of all ages.
B008M721MS|1.0|lot of people had same problem. u could see and hear them but they could only hear u.<br />shouldnt have even been on this kindle
B007HACDLK|5.0|A very good read,hard to put down sorry when it ended.  I highly recommend this exciting and interesting book and can't wait to start another book by this author.
B005HSL626|5.0|i did not play this my granddaughter did and she like the game very much it was on my tablet so thanks very much
B0031RS7X6|5.0|I loved the book it was very predictable but enjoyed every word!! I couldn't put the book down now I'll need to read one of her other books
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie has stolen my heart. The story and characters are so well developed & precious that I can honestly say I love them.<br /><br />I have such a better, deeper understanding of both the North & South (esp. during the industrial revolution), because of the historical value of this movie as well.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, the last 10 minutes of this movie are my favorite romantic minutes of ANY movie, ever! :) I often watch them when other romantic movies leave me unsatisfied...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BI.GI HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE GAME THAT I LIKE TO PLAY,I HAVE IT ON ALL OF MY DEVICES.IT IS A TRUKY FUN AND ADDICTIVE GAME.U WON'T B ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I'm a chick who likes both girly, fluffy books as well as courtroom-type dramas and thrillers. Just got done reading lots of James Patterson books (the Alex Cross books) but stopped at #4 because Cross was getting a little old - so I switched to Puller and like him alot! This book was a little out of my comfort zone - some military lingo usually scares me a bit - but most of it was easy to read and understand. I kinda fell in love with this over-achiever who doesn't want the big stars and/or money. Love him! This book kept me fully engaged and I'm probably off to read the next one in line now.
B0055SWM08|5.0|wonderful detail, soothing music, but best of all both my husband and I enjoy trying to solve the puzzles together and independently
B0086700CM|5.0|my granddaughter play this as well and she like it to it was on my tablet also so thanks very much
B008RA3X5E|4.0|If you need a simple alarm  clock this is the app for you.  Simple and intuitive.  Nice tones to the alarms.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This story has great characters & this movie has well cast actors portraying them!<br />I think it is a sweet love story!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this game. i am new to kindle fire,so i am still learning the movement of the cards is amazing
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Wide selection options to choose from. Most of the sounds are mixed seamlessly, while a few aren't quite so clean and I can tell that it's a looped track, but that's a minor flaw. The application does what it's designed to do.<br /><br />Greatly recommended.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I've never heard of this Andy Weir dude and there doesn't seem to be any more titles by him at amazon, but man can he tell a story. Great job! Thumbs high! Hurry up and write some more, you slacker.
B0065GC0BA|2.0|I'd heard rave reviews about this and couldn't have been more disappointed.  I thought all of the characters were one-dimensional - no depth at all.  Very predictable and corny.  The premise was excellent and it had the potential to be a really insightful story but failed in my opinion.  It reads more like a Mills & Boon novel.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|This is a great movie, what I would consider the best of the Robin Hood movies, and the one with which to judge all others!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I usually can not play such games but the &quot;hint&quot; button helped me to find the &quot;objectives&quot;. Keep on coming!
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I went into this cold. I hadn't seen a trailer. I only knew it was about a singer/songwriter from awhile back that had disappeared into obscurity. I hope that anyone reading this review has avoided the trailer. Because if not, pretty much the entire movie will be spoiled for you. Buy it RIGHT NOW. Whether a hard copy or on demand. Avoid any other reviews. They're all positive, anyway. This is an amazing film and the less you know, the more amazing it will all feel when it's revealed.<br /><br />The only thing I'll tell you is this is the story of a man from the 70's who put out 2 albums in the US and literally sold no copies. He didn't become famous, despite rave reviews. The question I still ask is: How could that happen? Even after the movie we still don't really know, but what happens after his commercial failure will blow you away.<br /><br />Now stop reading reviews and pick this up NOW!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Does everything it's supposed to.  Loads fast and keeps me in touch with family and friends!  I'll take it!  =)
B003YOEXUM|5.0|This is one of Accept's best records, hard and raw, violent and malevolent, interesting and uplifting. Get this record today!
1455807346|5.0|Entertaining, fast-paced book. Definitely easy to listen to via audio CD. The audio CD was just as good as reading the book.
0765325950|5.0|Conclusion of a lifetimes worth of reading. I have been with the series since I was 12 in 1996. There's nothing like saying goodbye to characters have become such a large part of your life. Robert Jordan did more for me than any other author I can think of.
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|Exceeded my expecteation. The musicmanship is remarkable. James is a wonderful artist who surrounds himself with like artists. Get it
B001DTPZNY|1.0|The only reason I can think of to watch this film is that you obtained the DVD for free, you have nothing else to watch, you're trapped indoors by inclement weather, it's too late at night to do anything else, you're resigned to the fact that George Lucas has become a fool, you've forgiven Spielberg because even a director of his caliber makes a bad film now and them, you have a bunch of friends over who want to watch something funny, and you've either downloaded the Rifftrax commentary or you're all planning to yell at the movie for being a steaming pile of alien-skulled poopie.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a 0 star experience.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|But then I knew it would be.  I love this game.  It's a challenge but only against yourself.  Dexterity is a must!  =)
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Very interesting concept and since the writing was that of a little boy, it was very cleverly done especially when they both were set free.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|This movie really sucked I'm glad I didnt buy it and just rented it , even still I wish I could get my money back
B005LAII62|5.0|This was really a cute movie so I sent it on to my grandsons to enjoy which they did.  Bravo!

B009IA9OLE|5.0|Awesome game!  Challenging and FUN!  I love the Max and his cockiness!  He's fun and so is the game play!  LOVED it!  I also thoroughly enjoyed beating the pants off of Max's dad!  =)
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's along the lines of old sim city. It's a fun game been playing for a few day and enjoy it.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I took my 4 year old nephew to see this when it originally was released. He sat still through the entire movie. He is now 12 and he (and his siblings) watch the movie each Christmas. I bought this copy for friends expecting their first grandchild.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Even though this is a very dark and twisted show, I am enjoying something very different from the usual drama and police shows.  Very interesting and suspenseful to see what happens next.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Gave this as a gift to a &#34;cars&#34; fanatic!  Loved the Widescreen edition and came in the time frame specified!
B00846REIS|5.0|For anyone who is a fan of 50 Shades of Grey, put this on your list as a must-read! Unlike it's 50 Shades predecessor, this book actually follows a more believable storyline than the virgin and the damaged millionaire. This book does also contain a damaged millionaire who is a victim of childhood abuse as well as the heroine. The story takes us through the twists and turns of a budding relationship, all the while answering the question &#34;is it possible for the two survivors of childhood abuse to have a normal stable relationship?&#34;. One of my favorite books I have read so far!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong only better!  The whole trying to get a good time or score challenges you really think things through and solve the puzzle in record time!  Love it!
1575666286|5.0|We came across The Gerson Therapy after searching for alternative medicines and therapeutics for everyday ailments and possible treatments for cancers in our family.  Well, look no further.  Our family have been practicing the therapy and it has changed our lives!  Btw,  organic coffee enema is a must for those who wants to clean their liver and kidney!  Difference was amazing after a year.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love this app. Its convenient, fast and accurate. I can check my weather at home or on the go and the weather where I am going to end up.  I no longer have to wait for the weather on the 8s or 9s of the hour, now its just one touch away.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well I fell for the hoopLa. Fluff and erotica for the teenaged kids, but not for grown-ups.  Can not finish it.  Worst buy I have ever made on Amazon!
0395389496|5.0|We took the kids on the Polar Express Train and we gave them these books to read along with the conductor. They love it and have kept it as a keepsake ever since!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I don't know how they do it but Dexter just keeps getting better and better each season! This season is mixed with Christianity and Dexter's own sense of right and wrong, along with the usual gammit of bad guys and serial killers. A great cliff hanger ending that has you anxiously awaiting the next season!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game  is amazing. It is temple run but with new stuff added to it.It is harder also but no  to hard.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My husband loved this knife sharpener, it works on all knives.  I even purchased additional sharpeners for Christmas gifts - big hit
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Even after reading the mixed reviews on this book I decided to buy it and give it a chance. I'm glad I did, but also a little disappointed.<br /><br />The characters are engaging, if a little one dimensional, and the story is interesting. The interaction between some characters is really good, others, not so much. Overall I enjoyed it and will probably read the next one but I will be prepared to be disappointed and annoyed by the typos, missed words, and the careless editing which allowed the wrong word to be used, i.e. reign instead of rein, a lot instead of allot, waist instead of waste. That last one had me slapping my forehead! It's going to be pretty hard to clean up the horse's waist! There were numerous places where the wrong name was used or \\"he\\" became \\"she\\" or words were completely left out. I also don't understand why it was double spaced unless it was just to double the number of pages (I read this on my Kindle so I don't know how the print version was formatted.). I double spaced reports in English class in high school when we were required to write a set number of pages. Pretty sure I didn't fool my teachers!<br /><br />Early on in the book Thor had his first taste of ale and drank way too much. Much of the following pages referred to the hangover he was experiencing. Further on, after the hunt, Thor again had his first experience with ale. Both times much was made of the fact that he had not had ale before and that he overindulged and paid the price. Someone should have caught that.<br />Nowhere in the book was it indicated that Thor was outfitted with clothes befitting his new rank. I assume he was wearing his herding clothes continually. After drinking and being sick at the alehouse he woke up in a pile of straw and went directly to see the king. No cleaning up or even mention of his appearance.<br /><br />The White Leopard, Krohn, went from having \\"just been born\\" to trotting along beside Thor to riding back inside his shirt to killing a rather large snake. This all in the course of about 4 days. And as far as I can remember the only thing it was ever fed was ale and Godrey's finger!<br /><br />The book seems to take place over a span of only a couple of days. Riding most of a day to the crossing and back, walking to the druid's home, hunting, and patrolling the Canyon and banquets, blackouts and training were all crammed into too short of a time period. Spreading this all out over a period of a couple of weeks would have made more sense.<br /><br />Way too little thought and effort were put into the editing of this book. It seemed like an outline for a book, not a completed book. Or, maybe no outline was done during the writing process, that would explain the disconnect between the two ale episodes (can you tell that really bothered me!) and the problem with the timeline.<br /><br />I will read the next one because I enjoyed the characters, but please, don't end it on \\"everything turned black.\\" That \\"ending\\" when a sequel is planned has been used and over used since way before I could read.
B00A2LOAKI|1.0|This movie takes what was essentially a story boarded movie already - and messes it up. How do you do that? It was all there on the page for you.<br /><br />Let's start with the voice talent - Peter Weller is terrible, phoning it in. Michael Emerson brings NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING to one of the juiciest, if not the juiciest animated roles in history.<br /><br />Now let's go with the direction - it feel rushed, ham handed, amateur. The pace is off, we are never made to truly care about the main characters and the soundtrack is bland and unremarkable, if serviceable (sort of). There is no vision here yet this movie begged to be made by someone with a vision because it's based on a visionary work. Instead it's lifeless and predictable. In fact it's hard to sit through. I honestly couldn't be much more disappointed.<br /><br />Where is the unique color scheme of the animated series? Where is the pop, the spark, the intensity to the performances? It's all missing. For my money almost any episode of Batman the Animated Series or any of the Justice Leagues has much more to say, more characterization and is more involving. I felt very separate from this movie. I had to invent ways to enjoy it.<br /><br />If you saw this movie before you read the graphic novel it would hard for me to convince you to read it. This is a shame as it's a seminal work. It's the Ulysses of comic books - a game changer.<br /><br />It is done a terrible disservice by this POS movie. Whoever is responsible for this should never be allowed to direct or produce anything animated again. This novel deserved a Bruce Timm, a Paul Dini, a Brad Bird even. Instead it's got the feel of a low budget cash-in by DC.<br /><br />Shame shame shame shame shame. Lifeless, poor. Unwatchable in parts. Just really, really bad.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read most of John Grisham's books and this one was pretty mediocre.  It wasn't as funny as his other titles and it seemed rather simple.  The book was not written in such a way that the suspense builds and you can't wait to find out what happens next.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Good album, like this new group, and continue to enjoy.  Will look forward to next release, but thoroughly enjoy this one.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|It was hard for me to get into the book.  I delayed watching the film because I wanted to read the book first.  But to motivate me to reading past the first 10 pages, I went ahead and watched the film.  That helped.  It took me to about page 60 to really get into the book.  The only book that ever did that for me was 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.<br /><br />I am glad I read the book, it's written well, and the overall story resonates with me. Lots of GRE words, which I like.  I personally, had to google about 50+ words to understand the context better.  Usually when listening to an hour of NPR, there is only 1+ word I need to google.<br /><br />There are a lot of parallels between all the stories.  I could see this book in 50 years to be regarded as highly as 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being.'
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a great game but it takes a while to open. other then that it is a fantastic game
B009EEFTMC|5.0|When I first got this game I couldn't pass my Kindle without playing it.  Then you try to beat your own time WOW&#62;
B001KZG99A|1.0|How do some people rate movies?! I used to read comics, when I was younger. So, I have some expertise on the subject. I guess Pepper Potts was before my time. I'm looking at this movie not as a comic book movie, but as a good action/Sci-Fi movie. First off, they could have done Tony Stark's introduction a lot better--boring. Secondly, they should have figured out a better way to adapt Iron Man's origin to real life better than they did--maybe a pipe bomb, bank robbery explosion, nuclear attack while meeting with world leaders, or a shooting. Plus, in a time in which medical science has taken another leap forward, introduce a sophisticated heart into Stark that is standard practice for his injury; to do this, setting could have been 2030(not enough changes to make the movie foreign). That's the bridge that allows Stark's genius to take over and fashion his armor with the heart, as an outpatient. Cybernetic science and technology has truly come a long way, too.  He's supposed to be ahead of his time and so then it all works out. However, he can't just whip something up the way he did in the movie on enemy turf with nothing to work with. They did too little with Iron Man from an action standpoint. Sure, lifting the car, flying, and the delayed explosion scene was nice, but is it too much to ask to have a couple of action scenes that mirror Iron Man's potential? Also, the villain was awful, too, and their battle was even worse. A waste of time whether you're a comic book fan or regular movie fan.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love it worth every penny. It is a great series and everyone should watch it! ! ! ! :)
B001O53BK6|4.0|It's a fun movie to watch, great for the entire family.  I will watch again if and when it reaches prime video's.
0439023521|4.0|I recommend this book to all, not just young adults.  It has romance, thrills, action, and wonderful plot lines.  I just reread it recently and it held up amazingly well!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This is a great little game for my Daughter to play on our tablet!  She is 2 and loved anything with a Piano!!
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Love it.  This game makes you think and plan and be corinated all at the same time.  Addicting.  Yes I would rercomend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVED IT!!!! I couldn't put my kindle down because it was so good. I can't wait to see the movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A lot less lag than the ios device for me really none, I think it's worth the download! Alot more good features one being minecart and hopefully more to come
B00APUYWYA|5.0|loved loved the movie. i just rented it but now i'm thinking of buying it. loved it, laughed a lot. :D
0307454541|4.0|Of course, by now, most people have read all three books in this trilogy and may have seen both versions of the movie!  It's wonderful stuff that one can't get enough of!  But the author died soon after these books were published and so will be missed...
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I purchased this for my Daughter to give her the day after Thanksgiving to start a new tradition she is (2.5) and really starting to understand the holidays!  She has never really watched much TV or Movies so I wasn't sure if she would be interested but as soon as she saw the snow (had never seen real snow yet) the kids and the train she was really excited and interested in every aspect of the movie!  Perfect for the entire Family to watch!!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I like this game because of. the challenge. I wish I. wish the was more action with rue perennial rather than reading it like a comic book
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood has done it again! it hit straight to home, and very heartfelt. I this movie recommend to all
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It was a very good, clean love story. But I cried through the whole book. Not something you would want to read in public if your a crier. But worth the read.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This was fun for a while.  Then even when I have hundreds of balls left the game decides it's over and I don't have any ammunition left.  Please fix the problem.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not for the type of people that like to tear books apart, but I loved it.  It takes you through a myriad of emotions quite looking forward to the next.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Highly recommended!! Game of Thrones envelopes you in a world of medival/magic/fantasy that you do not want to escape.  Good character development, twists and turns, and that's just in the first book! It goes on with so much more.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT. GREAT SERVICE. VERY SMOOTH TRANSACTION. WAITING ALREADY ON A SEASON 3, SO WE CAN ORDER IT AND HAVE ANOTHER MOVIE NIGHT WITH MY DAUGHTER:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I actually find myself loving this horse. it's just so fun and addictive!! It definitely gets an A in my book!

B004FP1WX0|5.0|im a big fan of the tv show and needed to see the movie... i could not believe what happened through Rel, Nev and their friends' journey for the truth... Alternate realities can be logical... And Angela's story is just that... logical... not illogical... Mindblowing... Jawdropping.. I even felt bad for her ... And Nev is just so freakin' debonair with his presentation that when he speaks, you listen... Whether you want to or not... It happens... Magic. :P ... Im also a fan of his RANDOM tramp stamp (as seen in one specific scene) ...
B0063IH60K|3.0|mindless fun when  I have downtime.  East to play with options.  I should use my time I other ways  for learning but the app. is just a fun game.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Loved the new show. It was great being able to get a show so easy without the commitment! Keep up the good work.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this is a great game for kids, and adults, to see what the responsibility is of taking care of horses.<br /><br />G
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Very engaging. I almost felt that at some points it was more of a fantasy-Victorian romance than steam punk (as the technological references could be somewhat removed and it wouldn't really affect anything) but it was most enjoyable! A real surprise, and to live near the woman who wrote it is such a fantastic bonus!! Kudos. Well written and definitely not boring. Found a truely talented and imaginative Australian writer. Those who read a lot of twilight-like, vampire/Lycan/werewolf romances and/or fantasies will probably find McMaster's novel is breath of fresh air - although some of the commonly accepted similarities (lust whilst drinking blood, war between vamps and lycans etc.) are still present, so it's not too \\"far-fetched\\" (so to speak) for those who like a corny/stereotypical vamp novel. It can be universally enjoyed so it has earned from me a 5/5 :)
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I love the Breaking Bad series! This was a must have and only $25 for blue ray of the complete 3rd season! The shipping quick and was able to start watching right away.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like the rain sounds but who would want a faucet drip. I needed this tho so Thank You very much, I can turn my TV off at night now because I have to have noise to get to sleep.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for children who love horses!!!!! Children will love interacting with their own horse that they get to name an  take  care of!
B005HSL626|5.0|Man I love slicing up fruit.  It's much better than slicking of vegetables.  I'm not sure what I did with my time before this!
B0038P59A0|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed with this movie. I typically enjoy most of Robert Downey Jr's movies but I for some reason I found this one rather boring.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book includes bits and pieces of twists from many other novels but never have I read a book that includes so many different twists an unexpected climaxes in 1 story. I must say the ending stressed me out a bit though. Wish there was more finality and redemption for the leading man.
B002B554TO|5.0|Record was as advertised and came in perfect shape, no problems, will be buying more record from this seller in the future.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I find this app very helpful in checking not only the charge level but the rate of charging by checking its reading over a few minutes. When I leave the house I want my Fire charged and this app is perfect for verifying that.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Now i read the whole entire series i love d it so much i really want to read it agin
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it gives us the op to stay in touch with all our family & friends.  Don't know what we did without it.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It's a great conclusion that was a long time coming but worth the wait. Josh Brolin is eerily accurate as a younger TLJ. There were times I actually wondered if it wasn't TLJ doing ADR but no, Josh Brolin's performance is uncanny. It's never distracting and the movie moves forward as it should. It's as good as the other two and, dare I say, has the best ending of them all.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Good reading factual.<br />Mark Owen is a brave man to have wanted the truth to be told.<br />I liked the book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love the television series! Like watching until the end because that's when you find out who really did away with somebody.  The characters are great, Ryan, Exposito, Martha, Alexis, Kate, the coroner, and of course, Castle.  All of them blend together really well!  Mary Laenger
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Absolutely, positively, amazingly, beautifully, funningly, extraordinary story I couldn't put down. The story has a nice pace to it and it made me think how I myself would cope in such a situation....not as well I'm afraid. Read this, it's just plain fun, ...Well done to the Author !!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is grate, it puts me to sleep. I would recommend it to everyone. There's so many sounds you could pick from. It's one of my favorite apps I have
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book is fabulous!!<br /><br />The ending was a bit unusual and it was one of those that you had to keep reading to find out what would happen next!!<br /><br />I found myself reading way into the wee hours of the night!!<br /><br />Excited to read all his books, I am a huge fan!!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Volume IV of this epic adventure introduces new characters and doesn't seem to be going to any conclusion at 60% completion.  I love the adventure and read each chapter as a one act play, but thank goodness there are references online to remember past characters and plots so that I can remember all the subplots and stories that are woven into this great adventure.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|well written, suspenceful , couldn't put it down, twist at end, shocking, will not forget for a long time, recommend to readers that like this type of book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There's so much about this game that gives a really good gaming experience.<br />1. The graphics of this game gives it a more of a realistic feel, which I feel that's what makes the game more memorable.<br />2. There's more harder obstacles which isn't so hard, but it gives the game more edge.<br />3. Overall, the new obstacles combined with a new layout map makes the game the BEST gaming there is.<br />It is worth downloading and I would download even if it was .99 cents.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's long, whimsical, stylish and stylistically multi-genre spaghetti western, comedy and southern plantation slavery drama  is, of course, also a tribute to the original Django (1966 with Franco Nero) as well as Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (the ride into town, with locals stopping in their tracks gawking, beautiful woman peering from a window, the Fistful of Dollars-type background score, etc.) Oh yes: Shaft is in there somewhere too. This  time Django is an African freed slave (Jamie Foxx) being trained by a German bounty hunter. It's disparate, it's bloody,  it's crazy--but it hangs together nicely and works on many levels.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was disappointed because of the predictability of the plot.  Howver, I enjoyed the point of view of the father.
B005FITIDC|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, I am stirred by the way God worked in him. I am also brought to a clearer realization of my own selfishness. This movie, better than any other movie I have seen (I regularly watch Christian movies)brings me face to face with my selfishness regarding seeking comfort and concerning not being a good steward of the money God has given me to manage.<br />I don't agree with many things I saw in the movie. I think, however, that God is using it to move me, so that is good.<br />I respect Sam's courage and his conviction. I used to work with violent youth and recognize how important it is for children to have a safe environment, and Sam was all about providing this most basic human need. I didn't like the way he preached, he seemed to be all about works, but I really can't know whether the movie correctly portrayed his life or not. And we are all growing in our faith as we walk.... I do think that his killing of the LRA was appropriate. And that the female medic was harsh in her evaluation of him.<br />He entered into the most chaotic and violent situation when he joined forces with the freedom fighters, I applaud their accomplishments. I hope the hang in until Kony and his men are brought to nothing. I also pray that Sam is concerned with teaching those children the gospel.<br />I have been stirred to give more to Christian organizations and missions since having seen this movie.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Nice time filling game if you want to think a bit harder than solitude.  Better if you could change card backs as in Solitaire, I'm not a fan of the spiders.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is really good the only probelm i've encountered is that the game crashes on the loading screen. I give it more stars but it's unplayable.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I thought the characters were unmemorable and weak in character.  The overall tone of the book was filled with despair and hopelessness.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great for creating the right sounds for meditation, relaxation or even just sleep the night away. With a wide variety of sounds to choose from, you can mix or match to make wonderful relaxing moods that can be labeled and saved for later. I highly recommend this app.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It sucks worst book ever u should really make a better book I'm telling all my friends not to read
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Great horse SIM but gets three stars for lack of support.  Forums show same problems persist after a year.  Friends list rarely loads or behaves properly.  Game often will not load, requiring several force stops.  Would get 5 stars if it worked 100% of the time.  Forum posts also show that players who react negatively have had their horses, items, coins etc. taken away; probably just speculation by unhappy players but it's food for thought.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! It was so fun to read. I loved it and couldn't stop reading it!!! I'm so happy with It!!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a great time passer I love it I could sit and play for a few hours and not even realize.  Only wish the app store had Temple Run 2<br /><br />  Amazing Game I recommend it
B00138H7F4|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful yet hard rocking. A true Queen mix of rock, ballads, and silly songs. Love the song about Delilah the cat while I'm Going Slightly Mad fits many of my days to a T. I've been a Queen fan since Killer Queen came out and this album does not disappoint..

B007BFSYMS|1.0|I just can't believe that any of the dozens of cats I have owned have EVER sounded like that. The sounds included are just not very realistic, and certainly not restful. I was never able to get into their site to download more FREE sounds, so I don't even know what might be available. Generally, I was quite disappointed.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|It has all the things you expect--witty, sophisticated lyrics that turn pop conventions on their head. A pretty surface with a dark heart. Gorgeous harmonies, impeccable playing.<br /><br />I think for me it starts with the drumming. It's very upfront and very mechanical. It's like a parody of a Memphis feel-- it has the lazy backbeat but it feels sequenced or programmed. Why can't he let the damn beat breathe a little? So what if the groove slips a bit on the bridge? It starts to feel sort of like hostility: this beat will never relent!<br /><br />Also for crying out loud, yet more songs about skeevy old guys with younger girls? It's turning into schtick.<br /><br />My favorite songs are not the same without you and miss Marlene. Both of them are smart and clever and wonderfully composed. Both are marred by the mechanical beat and by noodling solos. Yeah, great players, great aural qualities but no narrative, no drama. \\"insert tasteful series of guitar licks here.\\". That also starts to feel like schtick. Can anyone anywhere identify Jon Herrington by his style? He's a great player, versatile, impeccable, but there's nothing distinctive about his playing, nothing original. Think about the title track of Aja. Denny Dias has a distinctive style; Steve Gadd had a distinctive voice on the record. Wayne Shorter is one of a kind. Jon Herington? Yawn.<br /><br />Fagen's singing is great on this one--his voice has never been more expressive. I'd love to hear him do these songs on record with a live band, with players who have a personality. John Scofield instead of John Herington, or Marc Ribot. Players with some personality.<br /><br />I love the guy. I think he's made some really astonishing music. But there's some deep characterological flaw that makes him want to turn people into machines, machines that can perfectly simulate humans. It's like an oil painting reproduced perfectly on shiny stock and shrink wrapped. It's off-putting, even while it presents itself as moreperfect than the real thing.<br /><br />You'd think that all that time spent playing with Levon Helm would let Fagen loosen up. But he understands that Helm was a great drummer, and he understands why, but he can't help re-presenting it in machine terms. He's like a person who wants to be a machine who wants to be a person.<br /><br />Thank you Donald Fagen, for all your music. It's meant a lot to me. I can't listen to this one much, though, because the drumming sets my teeth on edge.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Downloaded and played wonderfully. This game is a hit in our house and is played all the time! Highly recommended.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Fun, inspiring, but way to short. Having finished this book I can only hope there is a sequel out there.
0307592731|5.0|This truly was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Strayed's poignant, touching stories of her mother and her honest telling of her physical and emotional journey was moving and entrancing.  Would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something to really sink their teeth into and remember for a very long time.

B00003CXRM|5.0|as for the cd it was your average cd quality and there were some special features available from the menu.<br /><br />as for the film it is story based loosely on The Odyssey. a few scenes from the film remind you from time to time of that notion. the story itself is simple but very entertaining. and, the actors do a fantastic job with their amazing charactors.<br /><br />the soundtrack is outstanding. the music of course is mostly centered around the sounds of the era and include many church style hymms. the sound of the entire film is very well done as well.<br /><br />visually it is just gorgeous. the cinematography is outstanding and beautifully captures the colors and landscapes that define the era.
B0094EDBM2|5.0|For those of you unfamiliar with this recording, the music is excellent. It's easily one of the top 5 albums of the grunge era. With several hits and a grammy to boot, this album has both commercial and artistic cred. The only really grunge thing about it is the production. The original album had an in-your-face guitar attack that I personally would have liked alleviated slightly for this remaster, but they left well enough alone and left the guitars up front with the vocals a little buried behind them. That kind of production gives the album a more indie aesthetic, but I like to hear vocals more up front. That's a personal bias though and is something that does not take away from the sheer brilliance of this album. The flow achieved on this album with the kind of diversity that was ventured forth is really remarkable. The band and producers deserve all the praise and accolades that they got.<br /><br />The remastering is excellent. There's no loudness wars nonsense here. The only differences I heard were higher clarity and separation with a little extra volume without sacrificing headroom. The remastering is immediately obvious without being intrusive to the original recording. The packaging is vastly improved; going from the clunky original thick, double case to the slim, double jewel case. It was always something that I disliked about the original. I put mine into a store-bought slim case but the booklet barely fits in it. The new booklet is the real gem of this remaster. The liner notes are unusually well written. I had no idea that Billy Corgan was as articulate as what he wrote. He gives us a song by song breakdown of how he came up with each composition and it makes this package a very interesting twist that you don't see with other remasters. Even the artwork has been improved from the original. It gives me a much better idea of where they were going with the art. Excellent addition to an already brilliant album.<br /><br />Any fans of art-rock, grunge, indie or early 90's rock should not hesitate to buy this. Especially in this great reissue version.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Found that this has really nice and realistic grafics. did have some problems when I try and open the app but then once it was up and running it has done fine.
0446554995|1.0|I have been looking forward to this book and am sorely disappointed.  Pendergast has always been somewhat unbelievable but this time I expected him to rip off his clothes and be wearing red tights with a big \\"S\\" on his chest.  It was beyond unbelievable, boring and predictable.  I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did.  In addition the three story lines never merged, it was like they had two extra ideas that just didn't fit or make much sense in the larger picture of the story line.  I was expecting the Constance and Corey lines to have some meaning to tie together with the hokey Nazi line but nope, they were just page fillers that didn't really matter to anything.  I'm actually glad I waited to get it at the library rather than spend my money on it.  I sure hope the next one is better, can't be much worse.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I love her voice and didn't think there was ever going to be anything I didn't like, but this one seems to be just a downer.  I don't know what I expected, but this isn't it.

B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Instant classic remastered. This album blew my mind twenty years ago and is a must have album twenty years later.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A very courageous and interesting journey for a lone single woman travelling the Pacific Trail as a means of dealing with her demons.  Kept your interest, wondering what lay  around the next bend.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Plot goes back and forth between LA riots and current day.  Plot twists are unexpected.  Not all makes sense, especially the IA cop's appearance at the end.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is a great Christmas album as only Rod could do it.  He has such an unusual voice and styling that it really makes for an enjoyable time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game so far but asked me to rate it quite soon. I like to pkay it while im waiting for sonething like at the doctors
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a great storyteller. She has the ability to draw the reader in. I couldn't put this book down. The only negative thing that I could say is that the story falls apart a little at the end. Still very worth the time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this novel and its sequel on my sister's bookshelf while visiting her a few months back. One night I took it down and began reading, curious about the worldwide hoopla. Not too far into the book, I discovered the novel's major flaw, aside from the weak prose, is that the two central characters exhibit few human traits. They have no emotional connection to either each other or the reader. They are not in love, nor do they express anything resembling love. They are spoiled, horny, artless, and emotionless. I found it ironic that the female protagonist was a literature graduate student, yet the prose, written in her POV, was the illiterate rantings of a hyper sexed grammar-school girl, hardly an educated PhD candidate. I believe, however, this is the true voice of the author, who shows a scary case of arrested adolescence. The two central characters, who are so banal they don't even require being mentioned by name, are simply props used to fulfill twisted sexual fantasies, for the author, the characters, and the readers. Erotica alone is fine, especially if written artfully, but it's the kind of sexual gratification depicted in this novel that is alarming. If this is what modern womanhood has come to (self-abusive rape fantasies), then the modern feminist movement has done women and society as a whole a tremendous disservice. I would hope women would expect more from literature, and from themselves. Enjoying this book is much like enjoying crystal meth and an abusive husband. Apart from the crummy writing, how could anyone sane like it? Something is wrong, something is seriously wrong.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Pretty good app but why doesn't it rotate when I turn my Kindle fire?  Also, apps should end when you quit them.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Once again Michael Buble makes for great listening.  He brings back memories, yet makes the songs his own.  I enjoyed this and think anyone would.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I am not nearly as engaged with season three of Downton as I was with one and two. Not being engaged means I am able to notice how completely silly the show is. The Granthams are ridiculous, flouncing about with their privilege. Violet is still funny but her lines seem forced and non-organic to the flow of conversation. The love story between Anna and Bates limps on, and Bates could be a complex character but the saccharine sweetness of the plot line jerks us back to the simple minded. Maybe it will perk up?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Seasons 1 & 2 of Downton Abbey is so captivating it has me wanting for more.  I have found myself watching it over and over to try to detect whether I've missed anything.  I have thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of this series and I look forward to watching season 3 each Sunday.  I love it, love it, love it!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was very addicting and a fun game to play. I would  recommend this  to other and played great on my kindle fire hd.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun  for smaller kids and some bigger kids it teaches them how to take care of horses love it
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I really liked the fact that I got this version of Angry Birds for free...I just wish that these games did not take up so much space on my phone.
B005D4YOY6|5.0|Bought these for my hubby and he loves them!! This is his second pair (his other pair is about ten years old) and these fit just a &#34;smidge&#34; tighter than his old pair but that's probably to be expected for a new pair and it is a slighty different design than his others so it may be just him getting used to the straps being on a different part of his foot. We love our Keens!!
B000002J5K|5.0|Give me some Lovin' was a little flat as was &#34;Think&#34; but i have wantedthis for years.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.
B0053XM7ZU|4.0|Part II of book three is full of conclusions which is no bad thing. It feels likeep a reward finally having some conclusions to some pretty major story arcs. The only issue is the way that these story arcs seem to snuffed out in mid stride. I don't know if this is refreshing, in that the story arcs don't followed the same tired predictable routes, or if I feel robbed of my comfort zones, and more importantly robbed of some main characters I was just starting to feel connected to.
B000V6583C|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said.  Great album from start to finish.  Obviously this album is one of the all time greats. How else do you explain the band getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame because the rest of their catalog is pretty bad.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this game so much! I just wish that rather than having to download all of them individually, you could just upload or update the version you have with all of the other ones versus taking up more space on your phone. Good game, no issues. Not to mention it was free!
B00899F0G8|5.0|Pretty little liars is such an amazing show, I love it so much and hope it never ends!  Watch it!
B00005NWLO|5.0|Skynard at their best.  It makes you want to hold up a lighter!  Those guys could really play.  Live is always better.
B0043RSJ8G|1.0|The whole book is a total cliche.<br />It is also way too repetitive and boring.<br />I Could not finish it.
B00138KDO6|3.0|Typical Rage album to me, a few really great songs and a bunch of filler songs.  The great songs are great and the mediocre songs are mediocre.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love this game. It's definitely awesome! Not to mention the fact that I also received this game for you guessed it, FREE!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Such a fabulous show.  Hate to see it go!  Xoxo gg<br /> xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo xo
B0063IH60K|5.0|Straightforward but still challenging. A nicely crafted version of a classic game, ideal for passing the time and relaxing quietly.
B004JHY80I|5.0|Probably the best novel of Sarah waters. A mixture of Dickens and Jane Austen.<br />Conflicted characters in a rotten society.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is cute, entertaining and fun for all ages. It makes you think! I recommend this game for anyone who loves puzzles.
B0015AARJI|3.0|The quality of the controller is really nice. The only thing I was really bummed about was that it didn't come with a chord.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have been a fan of Indiana Jones since childhood.  The movies are extraordinarily entertaining.  This is one of the best roles for Harrison Ford.  Many were overly critical of the Crystal Skull.  Don't let that discourage you.  It was an entertaining throwback.  The quality of the video and audio transferred to blu-ray very well.  I consider it a must have for any collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome sequel. The characters continue to grow within the story, but retain the lovable vulnerability that draws a reader in. Collins writes in such a smooth fluid way. Reading her work feels like hold a conversation instead.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|It is not always possible or easy to find best sellers that are indeed well writen. And far more difficult to find a trilogy that keeps the standard of the first book. Well, i would say that Millenium trilogy is a wonderful exception and a great surprise.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game very much. It is the best game ever! I love horses so it makes it even more fun!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Let me start this review by saying WARNING: during this book u will laugh cry scream and want to throw it e reader against the wall.<br />Ok. So this book is about a young girl with a  Secret, who flees to college to escape her past. Here she meets the drop dead gorgeous Harley riding tattoo covered Travis Maddox.<br />Let me just tell u, the chemistry between these two is amazing. These two characters are very dynamic and so are the other minor characters. If you like romance novels, ladies, your are in for a treat! Can't wait for the movie! Check out then sit  in the back of the book for teasers from walking disaster! I'm counting down the days for the one!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Having been a fan of the original and the sequel I picked this up. The quality of the video and audio doesn't disappoint.  They don't have the grainy quality some of the older movies do when viewing in HD.  A definite recommend for any fan.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another great book!  Thanks Stephen for this great read. Been a while since I've read one of his books and I wasn't disappointed
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Larson delivers an entertaining, thrilling, and well writen story, with deep and raw characters.<br />Larson's writting is beautifully practical and efficient. No spare words.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like this game,if you like hidden objects you like it too.It makes it like a quest so I enjoy it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|If the writing itself had been better, I would have given  this four stars. The premise was interesting - a plot with slightly new twist, and while it was not terribly believable it was entertaining.  Not a favorite, but was a page-turner.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great Movie and Great Book ! My daughter read the book first and then watched the movie to list the differences between the book and the movie as a school project.
B000VT7AUS|5.0|Great music from a sultry performer.<br />My first time listening to this artist. I was not disappointed with this selection.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|It is not always possible or easy to find best sellers that are indeed well writen. And far more difficult to find a trilogy that keeps the standard of the first book. Well, i would say that Millenium trilogy is a wonderful exception and a great surprise.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Excellent acting from everyone. Hated seeing M die. Judy Dench is one of the world's top actors. I understand macular degeneration, but why her?. I feel so bad for her. However she is a professional and classy women. She won't just give up.
B004HO6I2O|4.0|It's not the most original idea for a movie but it is pretty funny! I recommend it if you have a good sense of humor.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This app has helped me get together all the appointments, events, holidays, birthdays, and important reminders all in one place. It has really helped me since I have 3 kids, I am in school, and I have an intermittent work schedule. It is hard to keep track of my life, but this app makes it easier.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Like the fact that I could purchase the episodes I missed and the view was great!!  Can always go back to the library and view again.
1401929281|5.0|This book many, many informations.  Curandero book, fix problems.  Some part complicate, much remember.  This book useful.  I am recommend this book.
1932100660|4.0|It was recommended by a friend to read who had recently had a heart attack at age 39.  It reveals info on the low meat diet of the Chinese people....and how this relates to the health of their lives.
0811879542|5.0|My 3.5 year-old niece loves this book.  It's in her top 5 right now and reads it with her mom almost every night.  I was looking for something a bit more instructional, rather than a cute story, and this book is perfect.  My boyfriend even found himself reading at and following all the instructions- LOL.  Get it and you will know what I mean!<br /><br />Great find- wonderful idea!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|He loves this game, and would play it constantly if I let him. He is only 4 years old and has started asking for a Kindle Fire for his 5th birthday which is several months away! My daughter loves it also!
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of my favorite games! Glad I was able to find this app for my kindle.  Try it, you'll love it! Only problem: Its addictive!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I chose to read this book before seeing the movie. I'm glad I did. It was a great story of survival. I would recommend this book to just about anyone.
B0072N4PD6|5.0|Years ago I used this book every morning for help in spiritual growth. I started having mystical experiences including the vibrational state that is a precursor to out of body experiences. At the time I did not understand what was happening and mentally fought it. I now have beautiful lucid dreams and is able to see orbs from time to time.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not my favorite chick-lit.  It was pretty predictable and had a similar storyline to What Happens in Vegas.  The female character seems a bit too stubborn and let's face it, rich, smart, gorgeous-bodied-men don't usually beg to marry women so it's a little far-fetched--but it's an easy read for the beach.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My kids play this all the time. I have to constantly tell them that their kindles are for reading and not playing games. They keep pestering me to get the full version. I know if I do there will never be any reading on those devices! Overall though, they love the app!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you persist, you will undoubtedly like this book but you must give it about halfway through before it grabs you.  I admit I almost quit several times, but upgraded it once I got past the slow start.  in the end I doubled the starts I had originally given it and really liked it.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app has proven to be invaluable for my aging mind.  The convenience of the app, on my Kindle, and the succinctness of the information is a nice balance.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book! It was a great, fast read I would recommend to anyone who loves chick lit. I was never quite sure how it was going to turn out but was very pleased with the ending.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is great for me! I make lists of groceries, tasks, and other thing all the time. It really helps me keep organized. I am a student and have 3 kids so the whole organization thing is very helpful!
0788859544|4.0|I love this movie but i was pausing on key songs. Other than that it was a great product. Love
0316187216|2.0|This book was a disappointment.  Each of the previous 5 books in the series are far and away better than this.  None of the characters interested me very much.  This was unusually because a few of those characters were very enjoyable in previous books.  The book tried to hard to create that Western feel, and in many ways, it felt forced to me.  The climax was a bit underwhelming and the mystery and wonder of the world was not there.  The story dragged on in places far to long, in an attempt to give the western feel, that I felt was overdone.  Villains that were built up throughout the book were easily undone, or in some cases foolishly and unnecessarily undone.  The main antagonist driving the book were handled poorly in the end and never really lived up to their build up.  The world of the first law series has become less interesting after reading this book.  I hope Mr Abercrombie can get his mojo back because this book was clearly his weakest.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I was at 4,000+ and I went to the main menu and I had 400.... it drove me crazy, and my friend had that happen to her too. But overall it is fun.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I like this a lot. It protects my Kindle Fire HD, it looks cute, and it is durable. It is exactly what the description states. It works perfectly for my needs.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book and I love how the wimpy kid nooks in the kindled still have the pictures inside them.
4898153194|5.0|The close friendship between two souls shines through in the photos here.  This book is guaranteed to make you smile!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I suggest you GET this game its awesome don't read those bad ratings get IT and I'm only 9 YEARS OLD
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This thing carries a lot of Legos & suddenly my son loves cleaning up his legos & putting them in this awesome case.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I have been fascinated by the series since it began.  It is particularly interesting in that all of the characters are struggling to be good people and all of them are failing because of their particular choices.  I got the Green Arrow origin comic and was interested to find how much more complex and fascinating the TV series is.  I'm having great fun with this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is excellent!  Season 2 on Amazon is well worth the money to catch up on all the drama. I give it 5 stars.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Having read and re-read both The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, I grew to appreciate the remarkable applicability of Taleb's ideas  to daily life (especially in evaluating the thinking/ideas of so-called experts). In Antifragile, Taleb provides the reader with specific tactics to improve his/her probability of achieving beneficial outcomes across a wide variety of domains. Thank you, Dr. Taleb!
B005C0DHEY|3.0|Good informational documentary; not all necessarily factual.  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p qrstuvwxyz.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I enjoy the creative vision displayed by the writers of this series.  As the story lengthens and deepens they have been able to keep the characters and plots intriguing.  By expanding the scope this season they have kept the story fresh and interesting.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good movie!  Interesting concept, good actors, good story.  It was worth the rent.  I'd recommend to anyone, especially  Bruce Willis fans.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is a great way to stay organized! Being the president of an organization this app is a great way for me to stay organized!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so well written and is very real life that you can picture it playing out . Its so heart wrenching ,real emotions ,real people. I couldnt put it down. I wanted the story to continue when it ended ,thats how much I got involved in the story.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|its amazon! what more could I want!<br />The only down side is I would LOVE to use some sort of &#34;Share&#34; feature on my android phone to send product links to facebook, email, or SMS messages. sometimes I like to suggest products to friends and I cant send them a link to buy it. I think that's all this app is missing.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Very cute, fun movie to watch with family and just what you'd expect from Tim Burton.<br />I recommend to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose this rating because I thought it was great how the series ended. Mockingjay was wrote very well and The book kept me interested.
1616890835|5.0|I got this as a Christmas present for my son.  He is a NYC artist who wanted to consider sign painting.  I said he liked the book.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|always an amazing movie, and the Blu Ray edition just makes it that much better! this will always be a classic to me.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My daughter was watching this movie at school in her history class, but missed a couple of days of school being sick. I rented at home and watched with her. Great movie that gives insight into the Grecian Olympians and their culture.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|...on a brilliant author. This was my first Hemingway experience, but will not be my only! The Sun Also Rises opened my eyes to a new, very honest world of fictional narration. I can't wait for my next experience.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is a haunting filigree of lives coming together and of events so tragic you'll doubtlessly find yourself not sleeping at night for thinking of it.  This is the kind of book that you'll remember for the rest of your life.
0446580848|5.0|It is mind-boggling how relevant this book is to what is happening around the world, terrorism, al-Qaeda, Benghazi, etc. Very smart book.
0374214913|5.0|This book is completely enchanting. I won't waste time telling you the plot, just find a copy and have fun. It's the most fun I've had with a book in a long time. There's even hidden secrets- literally- to be found...ones that will delight you! I woke up in the middle of the night & gasped with delight! I'm not kidding! It's a brilliant little novel with big ideas.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Turn your brain off for a bit and imagine that a WWII era battleship that has been in sevice as a floating museum can be fired up on all boilers to full steam in a matter of an hour or so and that live munitions are still available in good quantity.  Once you do that, it's all good.  I especially liked the part when the old vets were there to make it happen.  Like I said - hokey - but hokey ain't necessarily always bad.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Intriguing and suspenseful. I love the convoluted way the story comes together. Couldn't put this book down until I finished.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|A waste of money and I am surprised Bruce Willis was in this movie<br />Very bad movie  and had no plot
B00000K3D4|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and wanted to get it, just never could kind it in stores, so i got it here.
B005FPT51K|2.0|We decided to purchase this baby monitor hoping it is compatible with our Apple products.  However, after testing it, it was not what we expected.  The picture quality was very grainy, and the would not always connect.  Needed to reboot/reset the system everytime the camera was turned on.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp at his best. Vince Flynn needs to write faster, didn't want to put down the book - page turner.<br />Irene, Coleman and Mitch makes a fantastic team their thinking combined makes the world much safer. Mitch Rapp is indestructible, he's like the energizer bunny both mentally and physically.  The behind scenes of Washington with dirty politician is an eye opener to the real world, but on the other side there're people like Mitch and Irene who looks out for the security of the people.  This is a must read to Vince Flynn followers.<br /><br />Buy it, enjoy it GREAT read
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! Can't wait to read the final one! Like the story so much more now that we are learning more about grey!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was not able to watch Downton Abbey when it first came out or during the second season. I downloaded the first episode on season one and was in love within the first 15 minutes at least. I decided to buy this edition which includes the Christmas episode on season 2. In one weekend, I watched this whole thing and then was in withdrawal until Jan 2013 to find out what happened. This dvd collection has so many extra special features on it too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning. A I read further and found out more about the plot, I was shocked! I have recommended this book to all the readers I know!

B003UYUP58|5.0|Cancer is a hard hard subject to read about, both technically and emotionally if you've been touched by cancer in some way.  This nonfiction book reads almost like a detective story, and allows the reader to understand how the science has gotten to this point.

Enjoyed seeing the videos & photos from the 60's and watching Harrison watching the Beatles appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.<br />Very interesting cllips of Harrison later in life and how Dhani saw his father then and now.  Very moving and educating. And I thought after the Anthology that I knew the Beatles!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|A very well made show,  The characters are engaging, the acting is very good and the storylines are always enjoyable.  All the actors are attractive and pleasurable to watch, yet seem believable in their given roles.  Simon Baker is charming, and I love Van Pelt, Rigsby and Cho!  Enjoy the romantic dynamics of each character and hope the writers keep up the good work.

B008NW67E0|3.0|Bought it for my wife as a gift. I've listened to it a couple times.<br />Just not really my style. I like 'I will wait' quite a bit. She's not overly enthusiastic either. I bought it cuz of 'I will wait' and the hype surrounding them.<br />The texts are quite good, makes you think. But for me the style is a bit repetitive--almost all are upbeat (as in they play fast). Not much on the mellow side.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Book three of the Mistborn trilogy has an amazing end! If you have never read these books, I highly recommend them. Book one is Mistborn: The Final Empire. Strong female (and male) characters, amazing fight scenes - Sanderson's specialty - and great characterization, these books are wonderful for any fantasy reader.

Sure, like most fantasy, there are cliches, but the concept of the book is really interesting. There are three other books in the series as well, all of which are really good.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson's first in a 10 book series is incredible. This book is HUGE, and it's full of a new world that I can't even begin to understand now he imagined it. The characters are amazing (Kaladin and Seth are my favorites), the action, as always, is superbly written - Sanderson is a master at action sequences, and the story captivates you. I read this huge book in a week, I just couldn't put it down. Waiting (impatiently) for the next one in the series, this book leaves you on a huge cliffhanger!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its ok but I like the first one better. it is harder to tilt than the first one too. other than that it is pretty fun:)
B009LRE040|5.0|works great perfect service , fast shipping , and just the way a was describe highly recommended , works super ,
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Much better then the first book and worth the read to continue the first book's story. More elaboration on the story.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is one of the most amazing stories that never got told. If you are new to the world of Firefly/Serenity and you like great characters, action, humor. love, sadness, triumphs and failures, then this is a great buy for you. I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi or westerns, but the combination of the two (with the amazing talents of all the actors, writers, and Joss Whedon) is magical. If you are familiar with the series: Can't stop the signal!
B00914JWSW|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift, but I know my friend is really enjoying Steisand's CD.  She travels alot and she can listen to it in her car.

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I'm a huge Brandon Sanderson fan, and book two of his first trilogy isn't left out in my love for this author. Picks up shortly after book one (Mistborn: The Final Empire) ends and continues the story of Vin. I love the magic system and the world Sanderson created in these books. I highly recommend this book to fantasy lovers. Sanderson is also amazing at writing fight scenes. One of the best authors out there for that, I think.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am glad that I finally read this trilogy.  It is quick and easy to download book to my Kindle.

B009G9Z08S|5.0|The animated feature does a great job of adapting Frank Miller's epic comic to the screen.  THis feature is dark, gritty, and features a distopian Gotham City in need of the Dark Knight.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Now in general i have issues with the establishment of organized religion and in particular the following of the bible, and thus normally whenever anything comes around with heavy christian undertones i cant stand it for more than 20 minutes before i give up, dig out the kerosene and torch it. But this is honestly a good movie, im not going to go into spoilers here but its just well a well written and executed post apocalyptic movie. And the religious undertones aren't crammed down your throat. Think more water world where the preservation of past cultures and artifacts is more important than religious dogma.
0385344228|5.0|I bought this a Christmas present so I don't know if she read it yet.  I do know that I received it with quicfk and easy service.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is too addicting. If you do not have a few free hours then do not open. Best app game ever
B0030B624E|4.0|Ok for starters im not the biggest horror fan, nor am i the biggest zombie anything fan, but this movie is just plain fun. Just enough plot to keep the movie going a romp through a nation overrun by zombies as we follow a group of survivors on their search for Twinkies and pacific play land, which if nothing else i give credit for informing the future masses what a Twinkie is now that they are no more since hostess went under a few months back. sometimes fun is just fun and remember to enjoy the little things
1907563202|4.0|I like this book, has project from easy to difficult, they have some cute stuff might not be the most useful item( ie egg warmer).<br />Overall cute book!
B005UPOAT2|5.0|this movie was fantastic, one I love cuddling up with my husband and enjoying the time together. Well worth the money!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I love that about her.  She is so<br />Raw and talented.  I love different.  And Lady Gaga is very different.
B004EQAVFU|5.0|now if like me you are looking at this movie from the trailers i must warn you, the trailers and name imply that this is a sappy love story, what they do not show is that this is an intricate piece looking at an alternate timeline following the consequences of our morality and pose an interesting question regarding what people will do to survive and how that could affect those we survive off of. Its food for though at any rate.<br /><br />Just don't sit down expecting the typical boy meets girl, etc story, this one is sad. But beautifully done. Most likely this movie will make you cry, even make you depressed the same way children of men or american history x will, but it will not leave you dissapointed
B009D0LBRO|2.0|I can't Play it on my Ainol Novo 7 Venus the touchscreen is not responsive in this app, please fix this.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This is such a great family movie, pop some corn add the butter and the family is ready to relax and enjoy the movie!
B006N9KFPC|5.0|I have seen Adam in concert and he is fantastic.  His voice is so pure.  Run to buy this c d, you won't be sorry.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|for a fun romp with greek myth in the modern world this is a good movie, for fans of the books, ehhh not so much, im not going to go into spoilers but i think its best described as a loose adaptation of the books, though its no where near as bad as the eragon movie was. Enjoyable and if nothing else i give any movie adaptation props for encouraging people to read the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a definite page turner and took a few unexpected turns. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great read.
B009H442DG|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED OLIVA-NEWTON JOHN AND JOHN TRAVOLTA, SO I JUST HAD TO HAVE THIS CD. IT IS A GREAT CD.
B00164GDA0|4.0|a long time favorite and key film from my youth based on a story by a key writer from my youth. transfer is great, could be better but won't complain. just glad it's made it to blu!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Not gonna say much, this movie was different from what i was expecting from the trailers, i was expecting a more epic adventure to change the course of a young girls life as she was being forced by the trappings of traditional female roles to become something she wasnt, and while that is evident in this move its not all there is to it. By and large i love this movie, i think its one of pixar's best though i still hold Finding Nemo and Wall-e above it. A good movie with stunning graphics, and who dosent love Scotland?
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|With the big name duo in this one I expected a lot more.  Funny at times, and it does have a good story so I can't dismiss it completely.
1931559317|5.0|Very thorough, it will keep you busy forever. Great layout with easy to navigate pages organized by times of year.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is really fun to play but It just took like 2 hours to download so yea and  I personally think if you don't want to wait then get something else
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun, some of the cooler things require gems, which cost real money. Overall a really well made game.
0307949486|5.0|This book is extremely long, but worth the read. I enjoyed this book thouroghly. I would recommend it to any reader.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|This app is fantastic! I use it on my iPhone and Kindle. It is great when you want to know the name of a song you hear, and you can easily tag the song, and then pick if you want to buy it, or download the lyrics, etc. I use it all the time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app!!! The animation is modern and it is much more challenging than the first temple run. This app doesn't' have any problems or bugs so far and doesn't' take long to load. I love it!!!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It was a good movie over all. Till you get to the end and then it was kind of dissapointing. Writers could have come up with a better solution
B00A31UXLW|5.0|I love Michael Connelly's books, fast paced exciting, can't put down writing, if you look at my purchases, there are many of his books but I haven't read them all yet, I take turns to read other authors in between.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've been on Facebook for at least 3 years and enjoy being able to interact with my family and friends.  I was so happy to see it being offered on my new kindle.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and it was  page turner.  I was a little creepy but nothing to major.  I'm usually a big chicken and this book had just the right amount of suspense.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is a great documentary about a very humble man.  Rodriguez is many things but above all he is clearly a great father.  Watching his 3 daughters speak  in the movie, you know that they were raised by terrific parents.  To even speak about the plot in the documentary would be to give too much away!  See it!!!
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I've always loved this series of diary of a wimpy kid, but I think it could have been a little longer, but jus the. Way it is leaves people to wonder and want to read it more.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This classic should be read by all. So many of us are like Scrooge wanting everything and not willing to share.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app/game to teach responsibility and love. my son always remembers to take care of his horses and has gotten &quot;attached&quot;. I like this type much better than shooting games. he loves the involvement in horse training and stable keeping which is actually a real life family tradition of riding and care taking! I love how hes fallen in love w/ this already!!!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I love this series I have been watching since season 3 and got hooked I buy every season and watch 2-3 times a year from season one

B004GHNIRK|5.0|Right from the start Victor Hugo held my interest and I am finding it hard to put down. Having now seen both the Stage and film productions it comes even more alive.
0393317552|5.0|The course of human history is filled with examples of inequality. The haves and the have-nots. For a long time the haves, meaning white Europeans, assumed that the technologically inferior cultures they came across in their explorations (New Guineans, Africans, Native Americans) were simply dumber or less capable than they were, and thus never developed advanced civilizations and technologies. Any self-respecting person today knows that all races are equally intelligent and capable. However minorities still form an underclass, and without a solid answer as to how this all happened some people, consciously or not, still assume racist or prejudiced explanations.<br /><br />Guns, Germs, and Steel paints the entire course of human history and prehistory in broad strokes to reveal a portrait of geographic roulette. Those peoples who happened to live in the areas with the best wild plants to turn into crops, and the best wild animals to domesticate, got a huge head start by growing their own food earlier than others, leading to specialists (blacksmiths, professional soldiers, chiefs and kings, etc) and thus advanced civilizations. By finally providing a definitive answer to the question of why some people conquered, subjugated, enslaved, or killed off others; and why certain races and cultures still form underclasses today, Jared Diamond has given a firm slap to the face of racists everywhere.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|the best show on tv thanks AAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++really love it so realistic can not wait for the next season good job
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Greatest book ever<br />This is an awesome book the parts are funny and the author Jeff Kinney is a genius with all of his diary of a wimpy kid series and I read all of them and their so funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|I use to like reading stephen king and hadn't for awhile. Thought I would try this. Wasn't quite what I was looking for. Good book, but nothing out of the ordinary for Stephen King.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again. Can't ever go wrong reading a Grisham book. I was impressed with the fact that the title did not typically give away the story line.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book rocked. I think it's sad that prim died. Curse coin. He was a good guy at first, but then he killed prim. :(
B00A6N8YTU|1.0|this movie was terrible, Its plot and ending were lame . I would not recommend this film to my friends
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Excellent app.  What sets this apart from other apps is that you can mix multiple sounds to create that perfect sound.  Worth every penny if you have a hard time getting to sleep as I do.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I would be happy reading Cornwell all the time. I have never been disappointed in any of her books, in fact I am amazed that she just keeps them coming one better than the next. That and I have seen her interviewed and she is a really nice person to boot.
0452277752|5.0|I can't recommend The Bachman books enough. Stephen King is so much darker and far more foreboding as Bachman. There is no holding back in it's very dark themes and viewpoints. Get this version while you can since King did have Rage pulled from print after one of the rampant school shootings in the latter 90s. Too bad I think because it's not a story which glorifies the violence or skewed thought process of the individual that leads the action. In fact I think people would be surprised how low key it is in terms of being violent. It's not a kid walking around just randomly killing. It's a very introspective study on the events that have driven him and his subsequent actions with hostages. It's a wonderful journey of a boys mental make up.<br /><br />The Long Walk is a great tale of competition of a last man standing marathon under a totalitarian regime. Putting on a show to illustrate survival of the fittest. Also a great tale the psychological journey and breakdown.<br /><br />Roadwork is a tale as old as time. A man defending his home and that which he has built and loves. He refuses to just throw up his hands and capitulate to those who are trying to take his pride.<br /><br />The Running Man. Don't go into this expecting anything like the movie. A few very basic things remain the same but is a very different game with higher stakes and an amazing finish.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great Movie, Love Clint Eastwood in any movie this was very heart warming and feel good movie great actors also.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|At home, I use a fan.  But, whenever I travel (which is quite often), this app helps cope with the different hotel environments I get stuck in.  I actually purchased this app some time ago in the Play store.  I love the fact that new sounds are released on a regular basis.  It's worth every penny if you miss it during the FAOTD promo.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|This was such a fun movie, and for those who have ever liked Accapella music, you will love it. Very clever
B004TI5N38|4.0|Didn't care for ending but overall a good book.  Another thriller by Baldacci.  This one is one hard to put down.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|i already returned this game, did not like it at all, had to pay to get to different levels, not worth it.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found this book more interesting than the first. There was more of a storyline, not just all sex. Each chapter left with a cliffhanger, hard to put down.
B004J64QSI|5.0|excellent dvd, have watched it several times already. i loved the play and i loved the dvd, also bought one for my daughter

B00AREIAI8|4.0|it's a fun game to play easy to use, kinda of simple right away but it's solid.I like the whole interface of the game.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|my grandson loves this game, very good mind game for his age group. i like to watch him play it
B00AOQ8KCU|5.0|\\"Lose something braaaah? I've been to every city in Mexico...\\"<br /><br />So begins the finest soliloquy this side of Bill Shakespeare. If you're not ready to drop your daily commute in a metal coffin and do something to show that the human spirit is still alive after watching this film, get yourself to an ER cuz your ticker has stopped its cadence. Swayze IS Bodhi and put the team on his back in this one, as Keanu tries not to foul it up too much. My girlfriend loudly screamed and openly wept when Pappas met his maker-I've never been more proud of her.<br /><br />Strap yourself in for this one, and you might need to watch it twice. That's right, \\"Utah, get me two!!\\"
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put down this book.  For anyone that's a parent, you can't help but wonder how you would feel and deal with this situation.  Didn't want it to end.  Not real thrilled with the ending but enjoyed the book a lot!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Loved this book a good love story that  I could not put down. I am hoping the second one is just as good.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this was a very good game, my grand sons play this game all the time, it keeps them busy on the kindle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is awesome and for a horse lover its even better but even for regular people like that are not horse lover's and angels sing with joy.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its ok I do recommend it though it is great for ipads!!<br />Also has quiet good ghraphics it is fine for kids also.<br />But be careful ( Has stuff you can buy IN the app)
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I have used this app for over two months and find it invaluable.  I like the info it gives me on my device and how the battery is doing.  I especially like the time to charge and the time it can be used for different activities(I.e.. watching movies, reading, listening to music, etc) as it helps me with planning trips and other activities when I do not have the charge with me.  I like the simple controls and intuitive nature of using it.  The price is minimal and you get a great deal for $1.99. I recommend this app to anyone.  I use it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Really enjoy using this app and being able to see how much battery time is left for different applications<br />SB
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|It is a great Soundtrack...love Howard Shore's work. I enjoyed the bonus and extended versions of songs that took me back to seeing the Hobbit on the big screen:)
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. I can't stop playing it. I recommend this to all ages. It way better then the Hungry shark games.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Nice UI. Cleverly uses images to represent the different tracks. Swiping through the pictures instantly changes the track.....yawn....excuse me...very pleasent, soothing sound tracks. very relaxing...zzzz, zzzz...
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a WOW!!!  I ordered 19 copies and sent them to family members for Valentine's Day.  This book has a POWERFUL ending and is a MUST read for everyone in the world.  Watch the transformation process begin!!!
B007SOQBCM|4.0|it works but it seems to freeze a lot at times.  Also I'm a huge HD person and its sad that it only goes up to 360p I hope there's a update to atleast bring it up to 720p.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has just amazing graphics and the horse anatomy is perfect the horse moves perfectly. I'd recommend this game to any horse or animal lover
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|What a delightful book! The End is a true cliffhanger, and I found myself angry because I wasn't ready for it. Fortunately the next in the series comes out in a couple of weeks, even though it is about Little Red Riding Hood. I would guess that we have not seen the last of Cinder.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|If it weren't for the low low price, I would have bought the FX-6300. Just upgraded from a 3870K system. It would get to as low as 55W for my system (includes 2 hdds, 2 routers and ips monitor) at idle or just watching videos. With the FX-6100 however, it couldn't get lower than 65W.<br /><br />800mhz@0.6875V (0.7875V is set permanent for sleep and other functions to work properly) is the lowest performance state I can set manually with Phenommsrtweaker in Windows without crashing. With turbo core disabled, full load at my custom max p-state 3300mhz@1.150V is 235W which is comparable to that of the 3870k. More work is done with this though because of the extra 2 cores. Recoding videos is noticeably quicker.<br /><br />So basically, I've set the processor's cool'n'quiet to idle at 15 watts (18 deg C AMD OverDrive, 27 deg C ambient) and go 3300mhz on all cores at 180 watts (about 32 deg C) when they're all fully utilized. Not bad, gets the job done quicker but I was hoping it would still idle at 10 watts like the 3870k.
B008G59IBI|5.0|I'm a huge green day fan and i'd say this is the best of the trilogy.<br />1. Brutal Love- Interesting, Not the greatest on here, i'll listen to it sometimes but i usually skip.<br />2. Missing You- One of my favorites, i like the quick bass Mike's playing in the verses. Simple ryhming, but catchy.<br />3. 8th Avenue Serenade- Similar to Brutal love, not outstanding but i like the \\"oohs\\" in the back ground, reminds me of Jesus of Suburbia<br />4. Drama Queen- What i'd call a filler. Its fun to sing, but nothing lasting but gets stuck in my head quite a bit...<br />5. X-Kid- Best Song out of al three albums by far. Saved the best for last i suppose! The guitar in it is great<br />6. Sex, Drugs, and Violence- Good, not great. Don't they have a song called Blood, Sex and Booze? Haha its catchy<br />7. A little boy bamed train This was my imediate favorite but X-Kid passed up and it went down a few notches. Good, again not great.<br />8. amanda- Its good! I'm just wondering whats up with all these different women on this trilogy! Amy, Ashley, and Amanda?<br />9. Walk Away- another Favorite on the album, its got a slow intro that picks up<br />10. Dirty Rotten Bastards- Gotta say it, catchy but, no.<br />11. 99 Revolutions- The guitar is again great. And i like it!<br />12. the forgotten- a good way to close it all up with a slower song. Its got a nice piano rythem in it!<br />Overall 8/10. I may seem to have critisized it a lot, but Its hard to come back from two master pieces like American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, but they did it! Props to Green Day!<br />This was my first album review, hoped it helped!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very page turning and wanted to make me keep reading and I don't read a lot and I really the whole series! I LOVE the Hunger Games.
B009OYTIXS|2.0|Stephen Amell seems like he'd be a good guy to have a beer with, but he doesn't project much of anything else on the screen. No anger, no outrage, no affection, no enthusiasm, just \\"I'm a nice guy\\". That's still leagues better than what everyone projects, which is angst and fecklessness. It's hard to care about any of them.<br /><br />A few of the story lines are pretty good, others rather stupid, even if you accept the premise of a comic book world. The screen writers apparently feel a need to end each episode with a syrupy moral lesson, each of which is forgotten by the start of the next show; it wouldn't do to have the characters change and grow.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if the series lasted more than the first season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is full of fun things. : ) !!!!!! I've only had it for a couple of minutes and I still love it even though it can be a little annoying.
B00AVASSZ8|4.0|These songs are absolutely beautiful. My favorite is Come  to My Door;  anytime a song can take you to a place beyond your  imagination, when you can visualize the lyrics, that is a great song in my book! Congrats to José James on a great album.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This app is great for playing anything you want to wake you up when you want! I love waking up to my favorite tunes and getting ready listening to them!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm impressed that it lets you play as far as you want for free. Or at least as far as you can! A little addictive. :)
B004XANKVO|5.0|This product oozes quality, and the attention to detail is noticeable.<br />The color combination, like the little details such as the zipper covers standout.<br />Wish they have better organization inside. I've seen backpacks for a fraction of the price with better organization capabilities.<br />Wish it had more pockets.<br />Overall I'm pleased.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Especially when I'm not in my bed. But I have the free one on my phone and I bought this one on my kindle fire and I'll never ever settle for the free version of this app again. I have so many choices! Awesome app!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Compares to Cityville on Facebook, but is way better. Not only do you build stuff, but you create field units and attack other players.
B008476HBM|5.0|Still a great story;even after multiple readings. Timeless. Will read it again in the future. A personal favorite of Jane Austen\\"s work.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This is a classic and one of Jack's best. It's an edge-of-the-Seat type of movie from start to finish. Kudos.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved how it kept in suspense at times how it was on again off again. I have recommended this book and can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out!!!
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Bought for our grandchildren, but grandpa & grandma enjoyed it just as much! Only drawback is the tire tracks left all over the living room. :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved both seasons of Downton Abbey! They take you back to an earlier time in England and show not only the upstairs aristocrats and their staunch &#34;code of ethics&#34; but the plain but very interesting servents downstairs that keep all in line for the whole house. I became very involved in all their lives and am now enjoying Season 3. Costumes are awesome. Anyone liking history and romance will love this program!
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Great cast, story line and a must-see if you love baseball.  Peanuts, popcorn and Cracker Jacks all around for this one.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|HOOYAH! This amazing story was a great view of the strength and determination of one man. A must read for all Americans.
B006H5120E|5.0|If you've seen and enjoyed the standard edition of Titanic, you will enjoy the 3D version 3 times as much!
B004QDCZ3M|4.0|I, too, like it. It's kind of like mid1960s folk rock. Yet, it  is modern enough to engage youth today.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|The integrated graphics are great. I can get 60fps on these games with max settings: Dishonored, Amnesia, Call of duty Black ops 2, Planetside 2, and Darksiders 1&2. I can easily get 60fps med settings on most games. Using 1866Mhz ddr3 is the only way to go with this product. I recomment Kingston Hyper X T1 4GBx2 sticks. The extra mhz over 1600 does make a good difference in gaming. The processor is also good in encoding and converting media files. All the reviews sayign it is a &#34;junk&#34; product is a lie. it competes easily with my i5 mobile processor and it out performs my i3-2120 in my old desktop. RECOMMENDED.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so fun I really enjoy.this. game cant wait for the third one hahaha its a lot harder but in a good way. I already have a top score
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I have been married a decade more than this couple and I could hardly take watching these two people.  I guess the two great actors did good creating this couple BUT it was less interesting than watching paint dry.
B005LAII80|4.0|A great straight forward action movie. plot was very good. This could have easily been an A to B action movie but they did a great job of adding in more story with character depth with very good pacing That not only added to the story but helped paint a great picture of the world that Dredd is a part of.<br /><br />great unique use of 3D. it doesn't just use pop out but lets you explore depth. When someone is falling, you don't just see the fall, you feel it. you see the space around him & the depth of the fall. when someone smokes you dont just see the smoke blow at you, it is all around. it fills the space very nicely.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  Understand completely why it had such a following because it explored things women might never admit they might enjoy or find stimulating.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Neo and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its habitants. During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity from a dark fate in his dreams. The great second part of the Matrix Saga. Highly recommended!!!
1439181780|4.0|Some of it is a rehash of The Secret, but it is good information and some of us need to hear things more than once before it really sinks in. For me, this series is a lesson in choice: how you choose to approach life. The lessons contained in this book aren't meant to be overnight magic pills, but rather a series of small changes you make over time to improve your life. You can choose to feel negative, angry, sad, etc., or, you can choose to embrace positivity, light and most powerful of all, love. It's up to you. I'm not saying you will never feel anger again, simply that you can choose how you deal with life's ups and downs. It may be true that these books are a new spin on old ideas, but that doesn't mean they are any less effective. Perhaps things need to be rewritten on occasion to suit the audience of a particular decade.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The story has been told over and over from as early as the twilight zone (prob earlier) &#34;Man is the real threat!&#34; without giving anything away we go with Jake Sully through his journey on finding this out.<br /><br />The real reason that Avatar is/was such a hit is because of the genius 3D. breathtaking & it shows off every aspect of what makes 3D a site to be seen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice variety to Temple Run - my 7 year old can't get enough... fun for adults, too. I highly recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the best game ever but if u want more action check out temple run 2!! It's sooooooo much fun! But this temple runs good too!!!!<br /><br /> If u want to hear more check out other games to hear more:):):):):):):):):)
B0061S0A64|5.0|I'm old, and technologically challenged, so I like the apps that are easy. This one works like a dream and is more fun than I can describe. It works better for entertaining my granddaughter than most of the apps designed specifically to do that only, and simple enough for a 2year old. Love it, love it, love it!
B005LAII08|4.0|Had fun with the movie but Princess Merida ultimately will not crack the top 10 in princess hall of fame.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I like Susan Boyle and this album didn't disappoint. Bought two extra copies and gave them away as gifts to delighted recipients
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It wouldn't download for some reason. Facebook is boring and I couldn't careless if ever downloads. Facebook app is useless.
1439153663|4.0|Tough subject, heartbreaking situations, yet I enjoyed the experience. It is an &#34;easy&#34; book to read as in it went quickly. Subject matter is not easy. For me it was a perfect vacation book: enjoyable, riveting, some substance but not overwhelming.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Everything I expected.  Added this to my collection and I am proud to show it to family and friends.  Something I've always wanted
B00846REIS|4.0|The first book was good, but the second in the series was better!  If you enjoyed 50 Shades, you will enjoy this series!  Great love story!
B005HSL626|4.0|its Friut ninja. Fun yet gets old fast. great graphics but gets old fast. Love this game but paying for it is a little too much to ask for.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I chose one star only because I had to choose a star. These things are just some sort of fad.....my daughter got caught up in it, so I bought her a pair.....big waste of $$$. These things started looking old and used up almost immediately and they fell apart in a couple of months. Don't fall for it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was so good.  I couldn't put it down.  I love the sweet love that's between Sky and Holder, and how they take care of each other.  And, how people seem to cope with terrible circumstances.  Wonderful, great story.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Played a lot of their other games and this one has better graphics.  Their stories are pretty good, just started this one so will edit later.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|First of all its a very cute game with a lot of great colors and interaction. Very cute animals... A 5 out of 5  !!!!!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|this dvd was to replace the vhs copy we have, It is 100% better than the vhs copy and we got the other movies too.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think this is awesome I bought everything for about $15 but it was worth it and now I am waiting for the new updates so I can get the new disease types
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I've seen the movie Wuthering Heights several times and recently watched the PBS mini-series. The tone of the romantic movie is nothing like the book, and the series is much closer only if you've read the book and can fill in the blanks in your mind. That said, the book is much more dense and dark than either and would appeal to modern audiences much more than the rather frilly movie and disjointed series. In the book, Catherine Earnshaw is self-centered and could easily be termed as mentally deranged and Heathcliff is a sadist. They mentally torture each other and are cruel and thoughtless of everyone around them. Bronte's book isn't the grand love story it's made out to be in the movie. Catherine and Heathcliff are more obsessed than romantic, and there's really not much of anyone to like. The setting is grimy, not grand. The characters are hardscrabble in a bleak, brutal world. I can imagine that it would be shocking in its day, but in the era of slasher movies, it's merely a pretty good read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The best app game of all time and their new game Bad Piggies is just as fun with a little more thinking.
B003YCIE68|5.0|this dvd was to replace the vhs copy we have, It is 100% better than the vhs copy we have.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is so relaxing! My favorite is running water and all of the rain sounds. After reading all the reviews I decided to rate this before it started hugging me about rating it. Very relaxing! I recommend this app!
B009HELT3C|3.0|Not thrilled with this movie, seen it all before. I did enjoy Josh Brolin but otherwise it was pretty lame.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Downloaded for my Kindle Fire he. Easy to use and seems accurate.<br /><br />I would recommend this app for other Kindle Fire users.
B005KP77WE|5.0|this dvd was to replace the vhs copy we have, It is 100% better than the vhs copy, we love it.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I felt drawn into the lives of the characters from such different backgrounds beautifully portrayed. It confirmed for me too that so often the less privileged in life given the opportunity can have so much compassion, courage and understanding for the misfortunes of the well born. I was interested in my own feelings towards the difficulty of someone facing life without the qualities and ability to do what they have passionately lived for. Love is a wonderful gift to share and rewards great.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great movie despite having Shia LaBeouf in it. The actor who played his oldest brother was amazing and so believable.
B001CB8NQE|4.0|I saw this episode of Stargate Atlantis on cable and liked it so much I bought the episode from Amazon.  It was well written and I only regretted that I had skipped a lot of the previous episodes of the series, not that I liked the series that much.  I especially liked the Johnny Cash version of Solitary Man (by Neil Diamond) that was played at the end of the episode . . . worth watching the episode just for that . . . good writing.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Excellent with Irish accents and rural setting in Ireland and describing things we experienced in our growing up in Rural Alberta.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|When I first started this book I was thinking it was geared more towards teens, and I think it probably is, but I read it anyway and enjoyed it.
B004ZJZPXO|1.0|Purchased this as a Christmas present for my daughter and did not open the box as I knew what was in it.  As she already had a copy of Serenity, I kept it and just now opened the box to play it and noticed that the digital copy expired on 12-31-12.  Purchased in mid-November and let's assume Christmas present as intended and let's further assume that since Christmas and New Year's are busy times, how would one take advantage of the digital download at this busy time of year???  I am formally accusing Amazon of dumping expiring merchandise in order to sell at a cheap price!!!  Screwed again by Amazon!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book had me at the edge of my seat, almost in tears in some parts, overall great book loved it. I can't wait to see a movie about it now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful!!! Totally not what I expected yet I just couldn't make myself put the book down. A page turner for sure. I would refinement this to almost anyone. Sorry for typos my phone is being stupid! ENJOY!!!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I will not repeat what others have already said. The game is very well written and overall quality is pretty good.  Music, sound effects and an interesting story are the key differentiators. (Much better quality than the \\"Free to Play\\" games)  Graphics are a bit dated but considering this is a two years old game and the low price, it is quite okay to me. Also their customer service is very responsive. I wanted to play in the original Japanese mode(I studied Japanese when I was in college and have a Japanese dictionary) but didn't know how to switch languages. So I e-mail their customer service and got a response in less than 8 hours.  If you want to play in Japanese mode you may need to download a utility called MoreLocale 2, which can switch your phone's UI to Japanese and any other locale supported by Android. Now I can play game and study Japanese at the same time. :)  Due to the good service, I ordered their new game Symphony of Origin, which is the prequel of this game and has much improved graphics.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I fall asleep every night using this app. The flexibility to create your own custom-made ambience is terrific! The  possibilities are endless.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|For anyone who loves horses this game is it. for playing it on a kindle fire the graphics are great, smooth motion. I have been looking for a horse game everywhere now I found one and it works great!!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I liked the little bit I got to play. It was not loading very easy but once it does it's ok. Just wish it would have worked better.
0375836675|4.0|The first book by this author I encountered was The Book Thief, which if you haven't read it yet it's about damn time. So when I found out this (one of his first books) was almost as highly acclaimed as The Book Thief, I couldn't help but pick it up.<br /><br />Then I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Every aspect of this book is captivating; the confusing yet vague challenges offered to a completely average young man, the characters, the setting, the structure of the novel itself. There is no literary aspect this book doesn't completely nail.<br /><br />My favorite part is the ordinary life of the main character, which is interrupted by the most extraordinary circumstances from the very beginning. The entire book leaves you asking yourself \\"why him?\\" What could it possibly be about this kid that makes you feel anything for him? Or the people that he helps-I mean they're nothing. They're people you would meet on the street, and yet helping them becomes such a profound and life-changing experience.<br /><br />I found myself utterly captivated by the writing, especially the age appropriate language and the fact that the main character talked to his dog (who talked back in his mind) regularly. There's all these amazing and puzzling things happening, but Ed still has to get up and go to work, walk his dog, and occupy his free time. Throwing heroics into such a mundane life seems silly, but it is pulled off so brilliantly.<br /><br />Of course the best thing about the book is the moment that you discover the actual message. Suddenly you're not just reading a book, someone is speaking directly to you about how you can make a difference in the world. At the end there is some very cool Inception type things that happen, and I can't stop admiring the direction the book pursued.<br /><br />I hope I have time in my life to read everything else this (Super young) man has created, because his worlds are vibrant and always (ALWAYS) illicit an emotional response of some kind.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|Like many other AHS fans I was anxious, yet sceptical that using the same Actors for completely different roles would prove doable. I was wrong. The writing and acting has been top notch all the way through. I have never been so horrified and intrigued. Jessica Lange's performance as Sister Jude is startling. Emmy and Golden Globe worthy.
0525952926|3.0|Most modern novels, at least those which are granted the status af >literature&lt;, can be summarized on a post card. The novels of Ken Follett, I would guess, are categorized as mere popular fiction, but even popular fiction sometimes fails to tell a gripping story. A synopsis of the later novels of [[ASIN:B000KZ276U John Le Carr&eacute;]], for example, could fit on a postage stamp.  The goal of modern literature seems to have shifted from telling a good tale to showing off the writer's advanced technique.<br /><br />Ken Follett really is an old-fashioned writer, in that for him the narrative is everything. The dialogue he presents is not especially witty or clever (although it conveys some drab realism), nor does he perform Faulknerian shifts back-and-forth in time or perspective, nor does he deviate from proper English grammar and punctuation. There's nothing experimental about his work -- just a good yarn. That's why I enjoyed reading Winter of the World by flashlight during a 32-hour power outage here. What else was there to do but turn the pages and discover if Lloyd or Carla miraculously escape from their parlous circumstances?<br /><br />Sometimes what is presented as an intense moment of suspense is far too obvious -- the Dewar family arrives at Pearl Harbor on December 6, 1941; will something dramatic happen the next day? We can't wait to find out!  All the characters miraculously find themselves at in the center of key moments of World War II, and with a few exceptions (as will be noted) the novel is a fairly accurate history of the major events of that war.  It should be -- he employed a team of historians -- but in the 1940s, no one would refer to \\"a black woman.\\"  She'd be called \\"colored\\" or a Negro or a Negress in polite society -- as the Black-is-Beautiful movement didn't take place until a quarter-century later.<br /><br />In the postwar period, no one said \\"nuclear bomb\\"; it was always referred to as the \\"atomic bomb\\" or the \\"A-bomb.\\"  It's nice that Follett didn't include Albert Einstein (who was completely clueless about it) in his narrative about the The Bomb, and that he introduces Le&oacute; Szil&aacute;rd, the real inventor of the fission bomb. Follett missed an opportunity to make his story more interesting by having Szil&aacute;rd make only a cameo appearance, because he was a colorful character who claimed to have conceived of the fission bomb while watching a traffic light in London. Szil&aacute;rd never flushed a toilet after using it, because he thought that was a job for the servants, so I suppose that disqualifies him from being included in Follett's book.  (The inside story of how the Atomic Bomb was made and the people who made it can be found in [[ASIN:0684162423 The Uranium People]] by Leona Libby.)<br /><br />Another way in which Follett is an old-fashioned writer is that the book is filled with fairly explicit sex scenes. I notice that most of the one-star reviews here are upset over the graphic depiction of naughty acts (if only the recent invention of venery would simply go away, and we could return to making babies by simple kissing once again), and the UK's \\"Literary Review\\" presents its annual Bad Sex in Fiction Award (by which it means >any&lt; sex in fiction). But these scenes are brief and help to enliven the story line when its sails fall slack.<br /><br />Those of us here in the Untied States, the most conservative nation in all Christendom since the Holy Roman Empire, fail to realize that there are many people in other lands who yet believe in the ideal of socialism to a devout degree.  Ken Follett is a Labour Party member who once signed a public letter denouncing a state visit to the UK by the Pope, and he's a true believer in the flawless wisdom of the proletariat.<br /><br />This has an unhappy effect on his novel, in that all wealthy people depicted therein are  . . . are . . . they're all >rotters&lt;, they is!  The proletariat, however, are all gentle souls who practiceloyalty, honesty, easy friendship, charity, and above all, tolerance. I believe that Follett voices his creed through one of the book's characters: \\"The war wasn't won by the free market and capitalist enterprise. . . . It was people working together and sharing burdens, everybody doing his bit. That's socialism!\\" (pg.831)<br /><br />Very well. Everyone's entitled to his own opinion, but Follett lays it on rather thick. The upper-class villains are depicted as leering, they're sneering, they're rude and judgmental. If this novel were ever turned into a stage production, directions would be included to hold up signs urging the audience to burst into shouts of BOOOOO! and HISSSS! each time a rich guy stepped on stage. The novel is so dogmatically liberal in its outlook, that when a gay character is introduced, you just >knowwwwww&lt; he'll die in a heroic manner.<br /><br />I confess that I may be revealing my Yankee prejudices, because it has been my experience that lower-class people are more typical of what were once called \\"churls.\\" The Ku Klux Klan rallies and lynchings were exclusively the work of the common people, and I likewise don't seem to recall any Teamsters protesting against the wars in Vietnam or Iraq. In fact, I was under the impression it was mostly college professors and rock stars who were antiwar. I recall Tom Wolfe's book on [[ASIN:0312429134 Radical Chic]] in which Leonard Bernstein hosted a party for the Black Panthers, but I know of no lower-class whites, either in the USA or South Africa, who were willing to allow school desegregation. Be it the \\"Know-Nothings\\" of 19th-century America, J&ouml;rg Haider of Austria or the Nazis, the intolerant and reactionaries are more common among the very people Follett puts on a pedestal.<br /><br />What's worse, Follett's socialist faith compels him to distort his history. Yes, most of the history in the book is accurate, except for the telling of the theft of the atomic secrets by espionage, which is deliberately made inaccurate for the convenience of Follett's beliefs. The minor character of Wilhelm Frunze obviously represents German-born Klaus Fuchs, who was a member of the British team at Los Alamos, but he never conspired with an NKVD spy such as Vladimir Peshkov in Santa Fe, as the novel implausibly tells the story.  Instead, he handed off plans for the bomb to Harry Gold from Brooklyn.  Another Soviet source of plans was David Greenglass, a machinist at Los Alamos, who also used Harry Gold as a courier. In addition to Harry Gold and David Greenglass, the spy ring included the wife of David Greenglass and his sister Ethel Rosenberg and her husband Julius. In the novel, Frunze and his wife are executed in the electric chair, but in reality, Klaus Fuchs (who was single at the time) was a British citizen and spent only nine years in prison, after which he moved to East Germany, where he was awarded the Order of Karl Marx.  The couple who were electrocuted were Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, who were convicted because of the testimony of David Greenglass. (It took six minutes to kill Mrs. Rosenberg, who was a chubby woman, and while the current was passing through her, the fat under her skin began to fry.)<br /><br />Welllllll, this account, though infinitely more interesting and instructive than the fable Follett rushes through, obviously won't do for the purposes of a book which purports to show how noble all poor and downtrodden minorities are, so if history does not suit one's purposes, simply change the history. It's done all the time!  And Follett has an altruistic reason!<br /><br />This book remains on the bestseller charts, and I and every other constant reader I know have read at least one other novel by Ken Follett. I can't deny his skill as a master storyteller, but although I didn't skip any pages of Winter of the World, and though it provided mild entertainment during the bleak midwinter, when I'd finished the book, it felt as if I'd spent several days going through back issues of Argosy and True Romance, as the odor of bathos wafts off of each page. There are too many implausibilities, too many standard plot devices, and too much leftist proselytizing.<br /><br />Having said all that, in all honesty I know that I'll read the next book of the trilogy as soon it is released. I'll grumble over it, too, but I'll read every page. It beats watching television.<br /><br />For a grand wartime romance, I instead recommend [[ASIN:1602470014 Birds Without Wings]] by Louis de Bernieres, a far better writer.berately made inaccurate for the convenience of Follett's beliefs.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a book I didn't think I'd enjoy.  However, I ended up liking this book.  It was simple but yet interesting.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a fun one, and substantially different than the original.  My only complaint is that some levels are hard to understand - even when you beat them (sometimes with one shot) you don't get three stars.  There should be a way to figure out what the game wants of us, without doing a Google search.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this book.  If I was rating it, it would be XXX.  There was an extreme amount of cuss words with the most used beginning with \\"F\\".  This book discribed 16 year olds having sex and explicitly describing the individuals thoughts and actions.  This book needs to be sold from under the counter as is Playboy is some cases due to all the smut and what could be considered as child pornography.<br /><br />There were too many characters.  There really did not seem to be a main story line.  It only detailed every characters back ground and their association to others.  This was done repeatedly.<br /><br />I know the author was trying to attract adult readers but she is only attracting the preverts.  There is enough of this in the world today.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to anyone.  In fact, I am too ashamed to admit to anyone that I have read it.
030758836X|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I just finished this book after being up half the night. I loved it. I don't understand the hundreds of people who said they hated the ending. If Alfred Hitchcock were alive, this would be a great idea for one of his movies.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I was originally excited for the fifth and final book and delighted when I could finally download it to my kindle. I am saddened to have the last book just so disappointing. It was as if the author just didn't know how to \\"wrap it up\\"!  :(

Although I wouldn't have picked this one up normally - fantasty / future / sci fi is not really my genre - I read it based on a recommendation I would trust.<br /><br />Wow, it was incredible.  Well-written, fast-paced, creative, and engaging.  You find yourself incredibly connected to the characters, rooting or booing them as needed.  The story continually twists, and although I wanted to reach the conclusion, I didn't want it to end.  I have already picked up the second book in the series, though it's hard to imagine that anything else is going to be this good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so cool. I was waiting for this on the kindle fire. I love how you can get mine carts and go zip lining
B005PYZG6E|2.0|No matter how perfectly you balance this stabilizer, the gimbal will transfer your motion to the camera, preventing you from getting that cool &#34;glide or fly&#34; look. It's just not a smooth,fluid gimbal. And it has a very limited range of motion which means if you try to track down low the stabilizer will hit your arm.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Rated 5 stars only by limited # of available stars. Wolfgang takes incredible artists over the top.  Can't wait for the next masterpiece!  Stay Frosty!  We are hear in Washington. 8-)
B005I4JG80|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, even though I don't have any kids yet, myself.  Definitely has some tricks I'll try if and when the time comes.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|I've watched it about 4 times already...The ultimate subliminal &#34;girl power&#34; movie.  Johnny Depp was hilarious / lovable.  The actress that played Alice was phenomenal.
B0093X805W|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone who loved the movies. At first I assumed it would be similar to the older movie but after reading it I think it more closely resembles the Tim Burton movie, which is fine just surprising I guess, it's a very good story and now I'm hungry for chocolate!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Once you pick it up to play you can't put it down. I didn't believe it at first but I finally played on my buddies kindle I fell in love with that game
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like Sudoku, this game is easy to get hooked on. It moves slowly, allowing you to 'learn' the tricks and get fast at solving each puzzle. That's the mesmerizing part. It can get difficult, requiring thinking and planning at which point I prefer to invest the effort into real life thinking and planning. Enjoy!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Enjoyed this cute little film. lots of fun for all ages! This is one of the best for Tim Burton, don't miss it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as gripping as the first book, but I loved the continuing suspense. This series is addictive and difficult to put down....
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was so much more fascinating knowing that I lived through those interesting times. King is a master story teller.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Excellent game! very long with great graphics and mini games. I highly recommend this one. the full version was only 2.99 and worth every penny.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|For eight years I have been a Bones fan and five for Castle.  This out does both of them.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be pround of the writers.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|I really love the first song on this CD, I'm enjoying it and received it promptly!  It's a very inspiring cd.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|Buddy Guy &#34;Live at Legends&#34; is a great snap shot of Buddy's yearly January shows at his club in Chicago. He tears it up from begining to end. The new studio tracks are also very nice.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this to sleep, read, and even keep myself feeling calm and focused on stressful days at the office. It's useful all day long and a great deal for the price.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|All the characters are so much fun to watch, even the no good meanies.  Wlll Scratch (?) ever get an acron to eat?
B008ODZEQ0|2.0|This documentary never quite reels you in. The story is great, but I'm a little shocked at all the 5 star reviews and praise. 5 stars to me means absolutely amazing, can't miss. This is hardly that. The doc has it's nice little moments but in the end leaves you neither better nor worse.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book is the first chosen by my Online reading group [Quilterswholovetoread]  It's beautifully written: Harold and Maureen, his wife, easily pictured by their actions - and yet, there are so many layers which are gradually peeled back.  The missed opportunities, the 'what-ifs' and 'if-onlys' that almost blighted their lives are discovered and beautifully dealt with.  There is so much hope in this book for all of us.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|My impression is that the historical account, while accurate, does have a built in bias. To be fair the authors state this, in effect, in the preface, by stating that the focus will be on those things they consider were wrong in policy, not all the positive things. Nevertheless, it is a good read with a lot of historical information, that is not very well known.  It should be considered with other historical works covering the periods in question, to get a whole picture of those times..
B007BFSYMS|1.0|Why the f does this app need access to my phone calls?<br /><br />Give this app 1 star till they fix this
111846446X|5.0|Great Book and great read I reference it often while I have been using my Raspberry Pi I enjoy it a lot
B003O86FMW|4.0|I could not put the book down.  Now I am at a low.  I did not expect the way this ended.  Have to go get the next book to finish the series .
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Not wanting to repeat several exceptionally well written reviews of the content and characters, I have to say I was surprised by the criticism. As a huge Les Mis fan, and having read the book several times, seen the Broadway performance, and sung along with the Les Mis original Broadway cast recording, I felt this version was beautifully done. Hugh Jackman is outstanding. The lines and subtleties of his expressions show a man of understanding and depth. The characters interact with each other and the screen in a manner that pulled me into their lives, hearts and hopes. I saw the film twice and both times the audience cried, laughed and clapped enthusiastically. If you are on the fence about going to see this film: please, do yourself a favor and indulge while it is on the big screen. Just remember to bring a few tissues along and go with a friend who doesn't tend to get into post-movie-mental-masturbation as that could certainly be a let down.
1476712042|1.0|This book is terrible....I am 75 percent of the way through it and I don't want to finish it.  Badly written and a terrible story to boot.  Don't waste your time or money.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|One of my very favorite authors, Nelson DeMille always brings the right combination of suspense and humor to his readers.  I look forward to his new releases - wish there were more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm Japanese. I was fascinated to read 'GONE GIRL' every day in the commuter train for 3 weeks in Tokyo. Though there were also places I don't understand with my poor English skill, I was overwhelmed by the dram of this married life. Well as a psychological thriller that depicts the duality of people, the depiction of mass manipulation is very contemporary.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Awesome!! It was worth the purchase. Recommend to every MB lover! We have watched it multiple times now.<br />Love it, love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it.  The characters drew me in.  I was so obsessed while reading this I felt like I knew the characters.  I laughed, cried, and felt for their pain.  It couldn't have ended any better.... Can't wait for the movie!
B007BFSYMS|1.0|okay so I'm sitting in the family room with my family showing them the app of the day checking out the functions and marveling the at unique sounds then my little son hits the brown noise  next thing I know we're all pooping ourselves on my nice white carpet poop is everywhere off the walls in the couch on the cat it's crazy a nice warning would have been nice now I have a big mess to clean up
B0048WQDIE|2.0|I tried to get into this book, but could not.  I read about 30% and stopped.  I may try to finish later.
B003Y58CKS|1.0|While the singing is wonderful, and the setting is more modern, I can do without the topless nudity.  Productions like this make it extremely difficult to introduce opera to younger people without having to do A LOT of explaining, thus detracting from the beauty of the music and drama.
B0030MTQNW|5.0|Music is far superior to most war movies. The arrogence of Monty is spot on. All the other actors were realist expect JW. I just could not picture him jumping out of a plane with that belly.
1412960991|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library and ended up buying it. Very detailed for first time case study writer.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I have a distrust for governments and films like this fuel my conspiracy streak. Plus, it feels like where I used  to work. Oh, my God! They're after me!
B001B1CBSQ|5.0|Do yourself a favor and relive the 90s--or at least some of the best music of it. If you've never heard it, GET IT! You won't be disappointed. Wyclef, Ms. Lauryn Hill and the other dude (sorta like Pavarotti, Domingo, and the other guy). Awesome!
B002VXGW2E|5.0|Amy and Meryl are two of the best. I love the scene at the end at the Smith________ in DC. I have been there.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I love the game but it has only 2 levels unless you upgrade. It ends the game right in the middle just as you are about to complete the second level. I wish they would say how many more levels you would get for an additional $3. i love playing the game though. It takes me back to childhood.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Watched the movie 10 or so times before reading the book.  Just finished second reading.  The humanity of it is so engaging.  Misunderstandings and assumptions abound.  People hiding their true feelings and fearful of speaking up.  How true in our lives as well, making the outcome even more satisfactory.
B000SGSU58|5.0|This is the best Harry Bosch novel so far.  Very strong plotting and wonderful character development.  Does not feel dated at all reading it in 2013.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Unlike The Hunt for Red October, this book was not very exciting and did not have much action until the last few chapters.
1565234243|5.0|Really nice book.  Has many pictures with lots of detail on carving the human face.  Again, lots of pictures to give examples of how to create the human face.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|and two of the movies are so dark it is almost impossible to see, but the sound is good. Still a good price for the 8 films collection
B005COO1X6|5.0|Ridiculous, suspenseful, and creepy; this is pure King Genius. I was so excited to see this short story on Kindle. I preordered it as soon as I saw it and waited in anticipation for it to download. I read this during my down time at work and still loved it. I enjoy reading King's stuff in the dark with nothing but my kindle light but this still sent chills up my spine in broad daylight.<br /><br />This is another car tale with plenty of evil to go around. The ending was a bit ridiculous, but then again so is the thought of a living car. I loved it!!! Defiantly worth the few bucks I paid for it and I am always happy to see King put out a new story.<br /><br />Another big thing for me is since I am reading his Dark Tower series; I see his subtle links he includes in all of his storied. Everything follows the bath of the beam, and in Kings world the Dark Tower touches his stories and I get such a thrill finding these embedded reminders. A great short story to read with the lights off, and it was very well written. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great quick read.
0790742780|5.0|A perfect quality DVD. Thank you very much. This is an very good movie about the struggles of our society.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Loved the sets in the movie and the first class acting. The ending was a little confusing to me, is it real or is it memorex but maybe on a second look I might figure it out. I'll watch it again and thats close to my highest recommendation.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Love Robert Redford!  Great plot and beautiful scenery.  Would love to live at the Gatsby mansion.  Add this to your collection.
0307346617|2.0|Not sure what I was expecting but this wasn't it. I knew from the description it was accounts from people the author meets and their stories of the Zombie war. However, I found myself getting bored and not able to focus on what I was reading. Some of it was entertaining but for the most part I was waiting to get to the end.<br /><br />I love Zombie stories and I expected great things from this book. I was working at Barnes and Noble when it came out and I saw the popularity and how quickly it hit the best seller list. I was unfortunately disappointed and wished it was better. I tried the audio version of this because there were some big actors who were reading the different parts. That still couldn't help this book be interesting to me. It is still very popular and a lot of people like it, I just hoped for more action and less chit chat.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I Thoroughly enjoy the game, you DON'T have to spend money to continue on with the game, you can interact with online players and it occupies my family. My biggest beef - all of the bugs!  I play the same game on both the kindle fire and an iPad, and there are huge differences. The biggest, I'll go to bed without energy on either tablet, the next morning, the iPad's energy is full yet the kindle isn't even half full.  What the heck???  More updates are beyond needed!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Bliss for Abyss! Great game! Can't believe the great graphics on my tablet! Loving it! But losing sleep ,can't put it down :-) !!
B000AP04MO|3.0|The movie is a little hard to follow as the plot line switches back in forth from past and present very chaotically.<br />However, if you love Audrey, it is great for your collection.  Her outfits are amazing.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Very well balanced, good bass when you need it, without being muddy or overpowering the rest of the spectrum. Headband is very comfortable, and has a good amount of pressure. I have pretty big ears, and these go all the way around them, not on them at all. Just like I was looking for. Cord is long and sturdy, gold plated, and with a nice, screw-on adapter.<br /><br />More than worth the money, far better than my Senn eH 120's I had forever.<br /><br />The pads are a little warm, so I'll have to see how they are in the summer. They seal well, though that's not a huge deal since these are partially open headphones. I think they have a better soundstage than the closed-backed headphones I've used, though they have some sound leakage. My wife has commented on the volume coming from them from about six feet away. They're good if you're the only one in the room, but don't expect to use them next to someone in bed, or block out noisy kids in the same room.<br /><br />Overall very pleased, an excellent upgrade to any low quality/outdated headphones you may have.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I am a seasoned follower of Jesus the Messiah, have worked in the ministry for about 8 yrs now and work both nationally and internationally online for the ministry.  This book is not captivating, it isn't really depictive of heaven.  While it may be intriguing, it leaves more room for his personal achievements and while I understand the necessity in relating that so that everyone knows that he put his stock in science completely, the book should be more about his experience in &#34;heaven.&#34;
B00APUYN0I|2.0|The movie is a teen flick I guess. The female lead was annoying and except for the songs the whole movie was a huge waste of time and money!
B000086EOE|5.0|Great collection of old Genesis songs with a modern day feel to it.Steve Hackett is awesome as always.Good stuff Maynard.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|Eliminates noises from my computer very well. Sounds great, though I'm a bit unsure about the EQ settings. The 0 setting is pretty flat, and the 1 setting boots the bass a bit and makes the overall sound warmer, but settings 2 & 3 almost sound as if they distort/boost the bass too much. You kind of lose the higher frequencies with these on. But 0 & 1 have enough bass for anything I've listened to.<br /><br />Works wonderfully with the Fiio L11 LoD for iPod. Sounds warmer/flatter than just the iPod alone, and provides a lot more power.<br /><br />Build quality is great, I always appreciate a company that will put a metal casing on their product, instead of plastic. And this is entirely aluminum with a glass face.<br /><br />Comes with a perfectly fit screen protector and silicone case! Also a short 3.5mm audio cable, rubber band, and soft carrying case. Packed in a sturdy iPod-esque box.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My friend told me about the game. I watched her play and I had to get it. Love it. It's very addicting though
1442344288|5.0|This story was fantastic never a boring part. The only part Idid not care for was when I finished it........only because it was over. I cant say enough about it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Bane is an awesome character with a very ... unique voice. It felt very much a Batman movie with everything going absolutely wrong and Batman coming from the very brink of everything falling apart to save the day. The intro of Robin was a bit weird but pretty nice regardless.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A must have game to download.  Thought game was going to be disappointing but turned out to be great! Awesome game so far so addicting
B00AKS656U|5.0|This is a really fun game and garfield is so awesome the game is addicting to me and it kinda looks like the garfield show.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|While this isn't something I would normally pick, I found that the angst of young illusionists was magical.  It took me a few chapters to get into the book, but once I found the plot I couldn't put it down.<br />If you like magical.fantasy you will love this.  I find the world of mystics very possible and I wish I could have some of their powers.  Powers to block others thoughts or make people believe what you needed them to believe would be a great power to have.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|A bit different from the original movie, but very good action and interesting characters. Some of the plot twists were expected, but overall enjoyable. Rated PG-13, but has a topless 3-boobed lady.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|This movie was funny the sound and picture quality was excellent . I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and felt like I was carrying around my own personal movie theater .
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I love Nicki Minaj so much as an artist and as a person, it's a great album! If you are playing on buying it please do!
B002MRROKS|5.0|I have been buying rare Nirvana albums for about 14 years now. I have over 35 Nirvana CD's. Most of which are very rare live performances and albums released in other countries. Of course, when they released the Box Set \\"With lights out\\", it pretty much made all the time and money I spent somewhat null. Oh well. It was all about the hunt. This CD/DVD is by far one of the best live recordings out there! If you are a diehard Nirvana, this HAS to be a part if your collection.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I think this is the best show on TV right now, and I'm not a horror/zombie/slasher kind of person.  What attracts me to this show are the characters, the writing, and the ethical/moral dilemmas that crop up in a world where it's kill or be killed.  Even if you hate horror shows, this show is amazing!
B00A2LOAKI|2.0|Similar to other complaints, I found the voice acting, delivery, and direction was just terrible. It was so bad that it was actually distracting and made it very difficult to enjoy.  For me, this was much more noticeable with Part II than Part I.  I know that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are a tough act to follow, but surely they could have done a better job here.  This video is simply getting by due to the strength of the original source material, otherwise I would have rated it lower.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This CD is a really, really good CD if you're in the mood for some hip hop/rap that doesn't sound like anything on TV. It's one of the best CD's I've bought in a long time.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I always buy my videos and cds from AMazon-top quality-quick ship. Best source for the best products you can buy
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was interesting from the start.  But half way through, I'm thinking 'the story seems to be winding down, how is this going to stretch another 200+ pages?'  Then you take a hairpin turn and have to rethink all that happened previously. It gave me the same thrill I got at the end of the movie \\"The Sixth Sense\\".  That's all I'll say about that.  Through out the rest of the book I tried to think how it might end.  No way will you ever guess.
B009329Y30|5.0|This is a great romantic movie! Definately recommend this! Perfect for girls night or snuggle time with your spouse. Awesome!
B005LAIHE0|4.0|As he previously demonstrated in \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" Jason Segel, who co-wrote the script here, has a keen eye for relationships and what does and does not make them tick.  In our minds eye it's all sugar and spice and everything nice on the road from first glance to the altar but nothing could be further from the truth.  The central couple Tom (Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) have a live-in relationship that's virtually blissful so the next logical step would be matrimony.  From the moment Violet says yes to Tom's proposal things start to unravel.  The sticking point is Violet accepting an internship at the behavioral science department at Michigan State University.  Tom has a terrific job as a chef at a ritzy eatery in San Francisco.  It comes down to Tom biting the bullet and letting Violet pursue her dream.  It's not long before resentment and jealousy set in.  Tom degenerates into a Ted Nugent wannabe by hunting big game with a crossbow.  Violet tries to reassure Tom that there's nothing going on between her and her department head(Rhys Ifans).  The pitfalls of the reversal of gender roles is numerous.  I found the film daring in its portrayal warts and all of Tom and Violet's relationship.  This is an imperfect film, however, because it looks like some honcho at the studio took their pencil to the script and gave it an abruptly absurd happy ending.  The ending negates practically everything that came before and answers none of the sticking points that came into play with Tom and Violet's union.  If possible forget the sweetness and niceness of the film's closing minutes and remember the more thought provoking aspects that preceded it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|have my fav cities saved and easy to use and as accurate as weather can be.<br />also like to see 10 day forcast
B002BI6SMI|3.0|This is a cheap, action popcorn movie. It makes no sense and this material is beneath Liam Neeson's acting ability. But if you want some mindless action flick with some cool sequences, this is your baby.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a refreshing read. It is safe to say that I love this book. A good anytime read. I think I completed it in less than three days. Definitely worth reading...maybe more than once!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game is so addictive! I would love to see more in depth disease development and extras. all in all I'm very pleased with the gameplay. worth the price! played on kindle fire
B0058VW36U|5.0|My grandkids ages 7 and 10 love to play this game. Nana can play it too and enjoys when waiting for doctor, red light, etc
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app that has good graphics! It is fairly realistic.  There are lots of things to do and activities to play.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|After seeing the HBO series, I became very interested in the story. Haven't seen but one episode and was completely lost. Really good read.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this game for my four year old to play in the car when waiting got boring for him.  He absolutely loves it.  He makes the cutest ninja noises while playing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Iam 50+ grandmother and I love playing this game with and without my grandkids.  If waiting for doctor or something it really makes the time go fast. Recommend for all ages.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A thrilling, exciting and well written book. Can't wait to read the rest of this series! A must read for all.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I bought this flash as a step up from the Nikon Speedlight SB-400. I originally wanted the SB-700 because the head can rotate 180°. Once I got beyond that I started to explore its operation and I can definitely say that for anyone who takes the time to learn, this flash will offer them a lot of functionality.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|This album is excellent.  Thrilled Soundgarden is back together.  The songs are not as 'dark' as in previous albums but still very good.  Black Saturday is already my favorite.
B004SBX112|5.0|Iam 50+ grandmother and I love playing this game with and without my grandkids.  If waiting for doctor or something it really makes the time go fast. Recommend for all ages.
B003S4G8RY|5.0|Quick delivery and great communication.  Product was clear and exceeded expectations.  I would recommend this DVD to my friends.  Scarry.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|Perceptive and authentic.  Keep The Lights On is an unflinching portrayal of a couple wrestling with drug addiction and the pressures of keeping a relationship on track in a city full of distractions and temptations, New York in the gay (19-) nineties.  Get this as a companion piece to \\"How To Survive A Plague\\", with a copy of \\"Hedwig and The Angry Inch\\" for good measure.
B000641Z90|4.0|Sadly, I couldn't catch Phil when he was touring ... this live production is the next best thing. Good quality sound, great picture and many camera angles provide a wonderful concert experience. I read lots of reviews about this DVD, and while some can quibble with something about the sound, view, or whatever, this is a great buy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Iam 50+ grandmother and I love checking mail anywhere and reading current events and news from anywhere. would recommend to friends and family
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first page.  The pages made me laugh and made me cry all at the same time.  It is definately a MUST READ!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie was hilarious. My husband and I loved it. Seth Macfarlane seems to have a weird obsession with talking animals!
B00006RG9K|4.0|Genesis has always been one of my favorite musical groups, and this live concert is a keepsake. Great quality sound and pictures. The guys are fun and my only regret ... Genesis isn't performing today so I can see them in person.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|uses lots of space and wonder if  updates automatically and uses more space...guess OK if you do lots of document production
B009ETEEAU|1.0|I expected more from a brand name, looks like it cost $3.95 to make, and should sell for around $10.00. And to just stop after a few minutes of use, it's not even worth that!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We are now caught up... really enjoying it.  I did not discover the caption option until recently.  Those make a big difference to us on Texas Rednecks... LOL.<br /><br />Sonny Hollub<br />sonnyusmc@gmail.com
B0082FPIY8|4.0|it makes a good albeit a little slow read. Would appeal more to readers who enjoy hiking, trekking.the writer honestly describes her experiences which at times startle you. But what sets this book apart is the brutal honesty with which she has analyzed her own psyche. It is quite shocking at places where she is talking about how she hated her mother. It is shocking because this is no work of fiction but autobiographical. All in all a thought provoking book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Iam 50+ grandmother and I love playing this game with and without my grandkids.  If waiting for doctor or something it really makes the time go fast. Recommend for all ages.
0765325950|4.0|I typically hate endings. I wanted to live in the Wheel of Time world as a young man, so it is sad to see it end, but at the same time it is nice to have a conclusion.<br /><br />I have to say I agree with some of the one star reviews in the fact that so much is left unexplained... I think the series deserved a tighter ending, and after so many books that seemed to wander so far just to have it end so abruptly in the last book feels awkward.<br /><br />I overall can't say that I loved this last book, but I did enjoy it, and it definitely doesn't deserve as many one star reviews as it has.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game!!!  It is by far the game I play most every day. I love creating new dragons and seeing other peoples games!
B003TH14H4|5.0|I have a habit of not watching things until they have been around for a long time.  If you haven't been watching Castle, I would suggest you give it a try.  Not only are Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Stana Katic (Beckett) wonderful to watch, but the supporting characters are all incredible.  I've gotten the giggles just watching the expressions on their faces on more than one occasion.  The plots are well thought out and well written for those who enjoy a good murder mystery.  Murder, mystery, romance, comedy, drama, fully fleshed characters, and action!  Castle really does have it all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|my husband and i are both over 50 and enjoy using this app. Have started trying to use in Church. Have not mastered that yet still use hard bound Bible for Church maybe with more use will get faster finding scriptures
B004LK5CEE|2.0|The Almost Famous bluray product that I bought is labeled as the director's edition as well as the bootleg cut.  It has an large, close picture of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) and in her glasses it has the words Almost Famous.<br /><br />This is a ONE DISC bluray edition, which would've been fine if they had included both the theatrical edition (129 mins.) of the movie with the bootleg or director's cut but ONLY THE DIRECTOR'S CUT (162 mins.) is included IN THIS VERSION with the following extras:<br />-Commentary by Director Cameron Crowe<br />-Intro by Cameron Crowe<br />-The Making of Almost Famous<br />-B-Sides: Behind the Scenes Footage<br />-&#34;Love Comes and Goes&#34; - the demo vocals by Nancy Wilson<br />-&#34;Small Time Blues&#34;<br />-&#34;Fever Dog&#34; Music Video<br />-Cleveland Concert<br />-Stairway<br />-Interview with Lester Bangs<br />-Cameron Crowe's Top 10 Albums of 1973<br />-Rolling Stones Articles<br />-Script<br />-Theatrical Trailer HD<br /><br />I'm so annoyed by the fact that they only included the bootleg/director's cut.  I would send it back but I opened it before I realized this.  So thank you Amazon for putting EXACTLY the SAME product reviews for this one disc bluray version as the three disc bluray version as well as having a misleading product description.  It led me to buy an item that I would not have otherwise and now I cannot even return it.<br /><br />As far as the original, theatrical release I would give it an A+.  It was an amazing movie and that's why I wanted to have it on bluray since the dvd version I had got lost or was never returned to me.  As far as the director's cut, it has over 30 mins of extra movie time and I love that, but it's a different movie with the added scenes.  It would really be nice if they had a regular bluray edition with both versions.  Is that really too much to ask for?!
B004H4XLRE|5.0|easy for a 3yr old to use. My boy uses it as a carrying case and launcher. worth the money
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this for my son for a christmas present, he loved it, they shipped it fast and it was in brand new condition...
B00APUYWYA|4.0|A great light hearted flick. We enjoyed the predictable plot and upbeat music. A fun cast, as well. Liked it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a fun game to play, there are many different settings to play with and its timed so you try to do it faster with each round
B002L5KKK2|5.0|This is one of Bobby Ds best movies. It's funny, sad and riveting. It's one of the best movies ever made.  It's a true account of growing up in the Bronx in the early 60s. I call it a \\"Stand by Me\\" with kahunas.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Must see!  Well done!  Things are getting more serious and the writers keep the twists coming.  I love Supernatural!<br />I'm ready for Season 6 now!
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I've spent maybe 30 minutes in game and I enjoy it quite a bit. There are many things to do and the competitions require some timing skills. All around I could see myself spending time, a lot of time, in game. If only I could consistently use it. There is a severe issue when it is booting up, sometime it works or it's either stuck on the main loading page forever. Also, I have been experiencing difficulty connecting with the social aspect of the game and finally many lags. Doing experience worthy tasks takes up a large chunk of your energy. 20 energy a pop and so far I only have a limit of 100. I really like this app apart from the aforementioned issues and dearly hope that naturalmotion addresses their designs flaws, even if it was free.<br /> Now for the good details<br />There are many horses, outfits and tack to choose from, be wary though one or more items in a set may cost gems.<br />Making gold is pretty simple and so is leveling until you reach about level 6.<br />The graphics are divine on my Kindle Fire and because of the multitude of interaction options it can feel like a realistic horse at times.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|A couple of factors make these headphones particularly attractive:<br /><br />1) Excellent sound quality<br />2) A replaceable cable, which means that unlike most headphones whose cables wear out after a few years and must be replaced, these should have a longer lifetime<br />3) A good price.  These used to be at least twice as expensive, but are cheap on Amazon for some reason.  Perhaps it's because the production moved from Austria to China.<br /><br />Note that as mentioned above, the headphones are open, so they don't block sound.  This makes them more comfortable (although my ears still get a little too warm after wearing them for 15 minutes).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it has wonderful graphics and I like to spend time with horses when I cant spend time with real horses.
B009RH973I|4.0|The case is great. Looks cute and pretty sturdy.<br />Only thing I dont really like is the flap that covers the screen. It's a little cheaply made and is already peeling apart.<br />Other than that, I would recomment the case.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game!  I haven't had any of the problems the other reviews have. I love that besides hatching babies, you can check in and play when you want.  I went 3 weeks without playing and lost nothing. Cute animals, fun quests and little commitment.  I also am on level 53 and haven't spent any money.  Perfect game!!!
B007JCP8FE|5.0|This is my first purchase from Shinedown.  I have like several songs of theirs in the past but had not gone so far as to purchase an album until now.  They have a very mainstream rock sound, but in this case that's not a bad thing. I would definitely recommend this album to others.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|awesome! yes,it was a celebration day when it arrived here! enjoy watching it over and over! lots of good memories!
B005I6HYNW|4.0|Great story. I recommend this series. The story engages and keeps you enraptured from beginning to dramatic and happy ending.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I saw this concert live, and this was as close to reliving it as U can get, she sounds great and her band is amazing!
B003FC1752|5.0|I love this movie.  The special effects and perfect casting are wonderful.  If you like disaster movies, this is it.  BUT, the transmission was poor, with quality beneath what I would expect.  Still love the movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is sick I got it and I think that it is awesome it's a never-ending game but not if you do the missions .I beat it but it took like forever. the upgrades are awesome and the jetpacks are sick. it's a good time waster and if your really board and don't have anything to do then just pick up whatever you use and play jetpack joyride you need to get this game and it's free to so get the game.<br />..
B001VLXNLU|3.0|Great story. I recommend this series. The story engages and keeps you enraptured from beginning to dramatic and happy ending.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|there was almost a surreal quality to this film and the way the protagonist had such a wonderful outlook towards life and made a game and humor out of everything even a Nazi death camp. His approach to life eventually saved his son. Being half Jewish myself it was particularly poignant and we often forget about the antisemitism in Fascist Italy during the war. The only other film that I know of which addresses this is \\"The Garden of the Finsi Contini\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a great read! Each chapter made it harder and harder to put down. I would definitely recommend!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|About half way through this book I started crying. Very moving story. Changes your perspective of the wars we are fighting or at least it changed mine.
B003ZY3050|5.0|4 STARS I LOVE ANIMALS AND THIS IS A TRUE STORY ABOUT A DOG AND HIS LOYALTY TOWARDS HIS MASTER<br />I BOUGHT THIS DVD IN SPANISH TO SHARE WITH ALL MY FRIENDS IN CANCUN MEXICO. WE ARE ALL DOG OWNERS<br />AND APPRECIATE THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH!  WE ALL CRIED AFTER SEEING IT.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a very good game.you can play it any time you like. it requires no wifi which is good.awesome
B007TNS6JI|5.0|incredible on the kindle. this game is fast fun and addicting. love it good job. this passes the time at work very well
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|If you love &#34;Castle&#34; on TV, you will like this book.  This is a great mystery:  plenty of tension, clues, and a little love story as well.  As I read the book, I could not help but visualize Nathan Fillian as Jameson Rook (the character named Richard Castle in the TV show).  I did find it difficult to put the book down sometimes as I couldn't go to sleep without making sure our heroes were safe for the moment.
B008DKBO8G|5.0|This is very cute, and fits very nicely! It protects my Kindle enough that I worry a lot less about it!
B000MMMT46|3.0|When I received the brand new vinyl in the mail it was already slightly warped. When it spins you can see it bowing up as it rotates. Sounds good though.
B004SGWYW4|3.0|This anime was ok. It had good idea for a story. It jump around a lot and i did not like it. I don;t know what going half a time.<br />I don;t know if it has missing episode or not. But I can say it has some hot girls.  I do not know if they ever get ride of the undead.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I hated every character. Not a single happy person in the book. Is this a look at her previous life before she wrote HP?
B0053O89KG|5.0|I obviously do LOVE Castle.... but a great season of Castle! If you like Castle, it will come as no surprise that you will love this season as well!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|If you like Sherlock Holmes literature then this purchase is... well just elementary.<br />I have enjoyed the books but when I'm out on the road I just had to add this to my electronic library.
1439190275|4.0|I bought the original Atkins book and as I read through the new one, I am happy about the changes they have made.  I appreciate that they can back it up with science.  Not every diet is for every body, this one is obviously restrictive of carbs.  I don't believe carbs are evil.  I believe refined carbs are evil.  So far as we have been on Atkins, we are quite happy with it.  Of course there are the cravings and that's something we're going to have to work through ourselves.  No diet is easy or perfect, but this one seems to produce results.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This arrived very quickly from the seller. I would recommend this seller because I had no problems with the shipment or the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I picked this reading for having an outstanding rating and don't regret my decision at all. It kept me intrigued the entire time. It had love, hate, sex, happiness, sadness and realistic. I couldn't put it down.
B007JMW46U|5.0|If you enjoy the workings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories this is a must have to add to your collection.
B000QUM3EU|5.0|This pilot episode shows why this was popular in the 1970's, the action and the banter between the characters is great.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great spider solitaire game especially for the free price! Fast pace, easy to see cards. I would buy this for free...oh I  did lol
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am able to keep in touch with family and from any where I might be as long as I have my phone or my kindle.
B009NPA3MS|3.0|I like Phil Phillips but didn't find many songs on the album that I would walk away humming, even after several listens.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I am a long time fan of TEDTALKS, so this is just one more way to feed my habit.  I love the portability of watching these on my Kindle Fire, and the ease of sharing Talks with others I think might be interested.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|nice game for eye coordination and memory. does have a tendancy to freeze on certain levels of game. this is a better version than my pc has
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is so realistic ! It's almost as if I'm actually there with a horse!!!!!I've actually been horseback riding before and this game is so much like your caring for a horse!!!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|From the first song, this album held my attention.  All tracks were good but Young Girls and When I was Your Man alone were worth the purchase price.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a really fun game!  It is a fast paced game, which I enjoy as a change  from the other match three games I have.  It does keep you engaged with the different levels and various bonus totems you can earn.  All in all, I would say awesome, fun game!  Buy it already!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|with the line up of stars in this film and the story line combined make a great film.....I have already suggested it to friends and family......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awsome<br /><br />Free<br /><br />Awesome<br /><br />Cool awakening Judith Busch sniff shush Riddick crucifix kiddo kiddo judiciary huffy<br />R dc exec recessed as games are cool things can get cooler
B001DHXT6G|5.0|As a Star Trek fan I was pleased with the new special effects and enhanced picture. Even the young people of today would love it.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Bubble Touch is an Easy game for older and young people to play. Keeps you coming back for more challenges. A+ in my book
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is pretty creepy but I like it it puts a whole new look on carnivals. I can't wait to play more games like this one.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is by far my 3 yr olds fave thing to play on his kindle. he will sit forever and thinks its hilarious to hit all the bombs
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite games!!  I am soooooo glad you had it to download!!  Awsome and Wonderful!!<br />Brings back wonderful memories of younger days.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|A quick and easy way to put you slidesd on your computer. Have a pair off needle nose pliers handy though as your finger tips will quickly grow sore from grasping and pulling at the edge of slides. There may be less labor intensive and quicker methods (I have thousands to convert) but for the price this unit works up to snuff.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|i bought this not even a week ago, and the first time i dropped it my entire phone screen shattered. I had to pay $130 to replace the screen. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS NOT REAL!!!!!! i should have checked the reviews first. I asked a retailer in my area and he said, generally, any LifeProof case under $50 is not real. Thank god amazon refunded me.<br /><br />P.S -- DO NOT BUY THIS. ITS NOT REAL.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|3 yr old absolutely loves this game. the graphics are really good and it keeps him entertained. def worth it to have this one
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Much better & accurate...then some of the other 1s out there!! Read reviews on anything b4 u get something ppl!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book although an intresting read says nothing about Jesus or Salvation. I do not believe this to be from God at all. The devil transforms himself as an angel of light. The Bible tells us that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. God is never called Om. i also have trouble believing the earthworm eyes view.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book was really touching. I was literally crying at the end of the book. A definite like for me.
B008NMT684|5.0|3 yr old loves it. he loves putting the puzzles together. really holds his attention for a long time. great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a hundred times greater than the movie! I can't wait to read book two and three. Great for teenagers :)
B00170MYIS|5.0|This battery arrived in record time and in excellent condition.  Thank you so much for such great service and great products!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I was very impressed. not like most other stranded on mars books. Not all the angst of why me and all the hand wringing. Just a fun study of what it took for smart guy to be able to stay alive for over a year on mars. If you are technically inclined and are interested in problem solving with mars thrown into the mix, this is your book.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Not really what I was looking for, kind of a rehash of the Alien trilogy....  It was ok but for those of us who remember Alien, this was kind of its ugly step sister...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was the absolute best book that I've ever and will ever read. I will recommend this book too everyone
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My middle school daughter and I have really been enjoying this show, where fairy tale characters are cursed and end up in modern day Maine.  It's been interesting to find out which fairy tale character each of the people used to be, and see a different version of the fairy tales.  In Season 2, the characters remember who they used to be (in the fairy tales), which adds another twist to the story.
B00AB3YG0G|5.0|I was so glad to see that the same person was reading this book as book I, Fall of Giants.  I just wish that it could have been in CD format.  Love this book.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Great book. Needs more romance but other than that it's terrific. Nico is awesome. The Percy and annabeth relationship needs to be more descriptive. It is the best in the series so far though.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is very addicting i cant stop playing it. i play it untill my battery is dead. so fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amaze!(amazing) and this is my fav game!(favorite) I cannot get enough of it get it get it get it!!!! best in world!!!!!
145162607X|5.0|I love this series by Philippa Gregory. I find her writing human and interesting. I would highly recommend any of Philippa Gregory's books if one is interested in English history.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I love hores so much I love this game so so so so so so so much
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm speechless, it really made you think, it opens your eyes and helps you see whats been there all along.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Holds your attention, I didn't want to stop playing until I was done. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone that loves to play hidden object games. Worth the money for the full version.
1451638450|5.0|Typical 1960s Harlequin plot: Boy and girl meet; boy and girl marry; boy and girl fall in love.<br /><br />But that's the last typical thing about it. I had a wonderful time watching the plot unfold and the characters learn about themselves, each other, and life's lessons. And enjoying the wit with which the author portrayed them.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The fact that is real and raw left me crying at the turn of every page. I don't know what else to say it was a great book but I almost feel guilty saying this, because of the fact it's non fictional. My heart goes out to you jacyee.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Just that - it was a fun read!  I have found myself thinking about it again and again.  I will probably re-read at some point.<br />A little sci-fi, a little this and that!
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved the entire trilogy.  For those worried about the BDSM aspects, I really wasn't that familiar with BDSM to begin with and I was not in the least offended by anything.  Key here is it is consensual plus was important to the story line.  I was totally overwhelmed with the passion, the journey these two people took to find themselves.  I did a lot of crying and could not put the books down.  I read them all within 2 days and then found myself wanting more.  If age is anything to go by, I am 60 years old so I am not in my 20's or 30's and I was totally captured by these books.  I needed to go back in and add a little more to this review.  This series was so good I have re-read it three times so far.  Each time I discovered something I missed within the last reading.  This trilogy is a definite must!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The actors chosen for Richard, Kahlan and Zedd do an outstanding job, and bring the book characters to &#34;life.&#34; Although I was kind of hoping for the TV series to stay closer to the books, this series is entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE horses, so this is my dream game! XD It works very well, it's fun, and it has good graphics!
0553386794|5.0|This was a really good book and I would highly recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />I can find nothing bad to say about this book other than to warn folks that if you read this book you will inevitably be compelled to read the entire series, which after book 3 is more or less a waste of time. Books 1-3 are really good, but resolve nothing. Book 4 is tough to take and I am not looking forward to book 5.
