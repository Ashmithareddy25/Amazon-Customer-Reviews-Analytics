0375826726|5.0|These books just keep getting better and better.  I was a little disappointed with the fact that the triology became a quartet, but not a big deal.  This book was excellent.  The character development is excellent, and you never want to put the book down.  I was sad when it ended, I wanted to keep reading.  I hope I don't have to wait another four years for the next book.  Can't wait to see what happens next!!!
B000AP04OM|5.0|. . .  is the fact that I can't get my young daughter to sit through this movie!  Perhaps I should think of some way to bribe her into watching it.  I suppose I could tell her that she can't watch television EVER AGAIN IN HER LIFE unless she sits though The Sound of Music!      I first saw it at the movie theater.  My friends and I walked back to the theater and watched it three days in a row.  I don't know how many times I've seen it since, but I do know this: I can't look at thick curtains without thinking of pulling them down and having a dress sewn from them.  I can't look at a brown paper package tied up with string (and string-tied packages are, sadly, so rare these days) without hearing the Favorite Things song in my head.  I can barely hear the words SIXTEEN and SEVENTEEN in the same sentence without singing THAT song!      So, yes, the movie is in my heart and in my head.  Now if only I could figure out some way to get it into my daughter's head!  I'm open to suggestions if anyone wants to send them to me.  (Send me a message on Myspace.)

The standard CD sounds much better when you play it in a digital 5.1 or 7.1 stereo mode. With this stereo SACD, you are forced to listen to it in 2 channel stereo. YUCK, what a disappointment!! I didn't even know that they offered SACDs in stereo.

B0010AN7Y0|4.0|This 1992 Film by stage and screen actor/director Kenneth Branagh is a real treat. Many reviews at the time simply labelled it as the English 'Big Chill'... though it shows some similarities in terms of plot techniques the films couldn't be more different in terms of style, performace and tone.<br /><br />The basic plot is as follows:<br /><br />Seven friends in an acting troupe graduate from Cambridge University in 1982 and go their separate ways. Ten years later, Peter inherits a large estate from his father, and invites the rest of the gang to spend New Year's holiday with him. Many changes have taken place in the lives of all the friends assembled, but Peter has a secret that will shock them all.<br /><br />So if you are looking for an entertaining ensemble piece, with fine performances, solid direction and a witty script you should check out Peter's Friends.

0385340990|5.0|Every now and then, I get my hands on a book that manages to delight right from the start and all the way through to the finish. Sadly, that doesn't happen very much any more, but when it does, oh! -- what satisfaction it brings. Such was the case with this delighful novel, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />Juliet Ashton, a single woman who has survived WWII in London, is putting her life back together, albeit somewhat slowly. She wrote a series of newspaper columns during the war, and now they have been collected into a book -- and the book has turned out to be a success. So now the author of Izzy Bickerstaff Goes to War has gone off on a book tour. It all may sound glamourous, but in reality it's a tiring, annoying, expedition, especially when an obnoxious journalist turns up with upsetting results, and someone is sending extravagant bouquets of flowers to her hotel room. By the time the book tour is over, Juliet is relieved to be home, but she still doesn't quite have the energy to cope with the new complications in her life. Namely, the would be suitor who sent her all of those flowers, and while Markham V. Reynolds is certainly wealthy, tall, dark and shamelessly handsome, there's something a bit off about him that Juliet doesn't quite trust.<br /><br />On a happier note, she also has a surprise awaiting her when she returns to London. A man by the name of Dawsey Adams has written to her after finding her name and address in the flyleaf of a book that she had sold. He's from the Channel Islands, and more specificially, Guernsey. And her book has opened up a world for him, where words can be magic, and a new experience awaits.<br /><br />At the center of the novel is the night when the Society was created, and how it provided a lifeline to a group of people trying to survive German occupation. Told in a series of letters exchanged between members of the Society and Juliet, it's a wonderful means of telling a story. I found myself laughing out loud at some of them, and actually crying out OH NO! at one point, and moved to tears at another.<br /><br />The use of letters to tell a story isn't a new concept. One of the earliest European novels, Les Liaisons Dangereuse, is made up of just letters exchanged between the main characters. And it is a very effective way to let the reader into the minds of the characters, and how memory works. It's also a way of eavesdropping as it were, into the inimate thoughts and hopes of a person, in a way that straight prose narrative just can not capture.<br /><br />I confess that I loved reading this book. By turns I found the story hopeful, exasperating -- especially whenever the priggish Miss Adelaide Addison wrote anything -- and the comical. Many of the characters have stuck in my head, among them Sydney, Juliet's friend and partner; Isola Pribby, with her homemade herbal brews, and finally, Elizabeth McKenna, of which I shan't say much more, as I really don't want to ruin anyone's surprises.<br /><br />As with all good books, there's plenty of sorrow threaded through this novel, as the memories come forward of the German Occupation of the Channel Islands. Many of the stories are heartbreaking to read, and at times, I had to set the book aside and go for a walk to settle down before I could pick it up again. There's not a lot of books that can do that to me anymore, but this one did. What it has sparked in me is a desire to learn more about this little known corner of the world, as I had known about this episode in history, but not very much.<br /><br />All in all, this is a must-read, and one that any bibliophile will delight in. It's gotten rave reviews, and I can happily say that this is worth it to find, whether you find it in your local library or purchase it for yourself. As to my copy, it's going straight to my 'keeper' shelf.<br /><br />Five stars.of them, and actually crying out OH NO! at one point, and moved to tears at another.

B001F7XIJW|5.0|This is what I could call \\"Art in music.\\"  There's something going on here aside from what we're used to, which is a group of salespeople looking to craft the next catchy tune to sell millions of records and get famous on MTV/radio.  This is the craft of people who care about music as an art form.    Having said that, this album doesn't contain the catchy tunes of their previous effort, From Mars to Sirius... and I consider that a good thing.  Catchy songs infer repetition, and FMTS had a lot of repetition.  Still an amazing album, possibly my second favorite metal recording after...    THE WAY OF ALL FLESH!  This album has knocked it out of the park.  Hey good sir and/or madam, do you like metal?  Buy this disc now.  If you don't like it, you may not assume the title \\"metalhead.\\"  This is where it's at:  heavy as bricks riffing, blood-curdling screams, near-robotic drumming, and bleak lyrical content.  But it's INTERESTING!  Non-linear song structures, long instrumental breaks, patches of ambiance, multi-length tracks; it's like listening to a Rush CD.  (Side note:  Gojira does not do solos.  Solos WOULD NOT fit the music.  And it's actually refreshing to hear a band that doesn't feel compelled to do solos just for the fact [Strapping Young Lad, anybody?].)    There are elements of thrash, doom, death, grind, etc... it's a beautiful amalgamation.  However, I honestly can't think of one band who I could classify as \\"sounding like Gojira.\\"  Truly, truly original stuff.  And this originality, combined with unrelenting heaviness, help award THE WAY OF ALL FLESH \\"the Best CD of 2008 So Far\\".  (Currently, Opeth's \\"Watershed\\" is second runner-up.)    PS:  Buy the album.  You'll adore it.  Sell your Trivium records and replace them with Gojira records.

They are talented, unique and as I have always said...the world's best (relatively) unknown rock band.  They never got the stardom they richly deserve.  But I guess that makes them even more special...!

B00005JPUN|4.0|The Invasion was a very enjoyable four star remake of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. This particular Blue-Ray DVD appeared to be an exceptional video transfer on my large screen HDTV. The Invasion did not feature too many special effects but did open with some nice CGI animations of the space shuttle burning up during re-entry. Other very excellent computer animations of space-borne microbes and some exciting stunt and action shots did appear during the course of the film, but it was definitely not a special effects movie and aimed its greatest efforts at telling a fine story.<br /><br />It told a good solid sci-fi tale open to many interpretations. I have watched all three productions, however, much as I liked the original felt this was somehow the best.  Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig were both excellent.  Nicole was beautiful and appears to grow more so with each passing year. Daniel (James Bond) Craig was very likeable and charming in his role and also helped make this film a hit with me.
B001E7X4M4|4.0|I remember watching Unearth play in New Haven, CT last October. Before going onstage, Buz warmed up to Yngwie Malmsteen's \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\". I wouldn't ever expect an Unearth CD to be an over-the-top shred fest, but one has to wonder why he was holding back on CD's when he can shred like this. Prior to the release of \\"The March\\", solos were scarce. The only ones I can recall were the solos on \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" and \\"So It Goes\\". (Off of \\"The Oncoming Storm\\", and \\"III:In the Eyes of Fire\\", respectively) Those two are great solos. The good news is that there are a substantial amount of solos on \\"The March\\".    As far as the sound goes, the other reviewers are correct; Unearth sounds like Unearth at this point. What they have done, however, is tweak their sound. As I mentioned before, this album is more lead guitar oriented than their previous three. The solos on \\"The Chosen\\", \\"We Are Not Anonymous\\", and \\"My Will Be Done\\" are nothing short of amazing. The standout song would have to be \\"The Chosen\\", due to its anthemic nature. It is different from anything Unearth have done before. \\"The March\\" sounds fresh, but it is still definitely Unearth. It is highly melodic, there are still some breakdowns, and Trevor Phipps still has that throaty yell.    Ultimately, this sounds like Unearth with a few twists here and there. It makes it interesting enough to warrant repeat listens. Unearth are one of my favorite metalcore bands. They are metalcore done right. Check this CD out.
0780626966|5.0|Nightmare on Elm Street  Rating: ****  The best of the bunch, Wes Craven's original is scary, tense and has an undercurrent of sexual politics that acts as social commentary on 80's horror movies.  Freddy, the symbol of repressed carnal desires, terrorizes the dreams of teens in the overly-pleasant town of Springwood.  Loaded with sexual symbolism (Freddy chokes his Rod, and Johnny Depp has the goriest wet dream ever), the film has a knowing sense of humor about itself and boasts some impressive visuals, despite its relatively low budget.  Even so, I can't say that it's my favorite one...    (Note: The film included in this DVD set is not the Two Disc Infinifilm Edition with extra commentary and features)    Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge  Rating: **1/2  Often derided as the \\"gayest\\" of the series, and this much is true, yet it's all done in a way that keeps to the subtext of the first film.  Freddy's still scary, and still a disturbing symbol of repressed sexual desire, but this time the gender tables are turned.  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I find it interesting from a film analysis perspective.  Even so, the blatant symbolism does get a bit tiresome, and there are several cornball sequences that could have been cut entirely.  In the end, it's a lack of any subtlety that hurts this one.    Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors  Rating: ***1/2  The first one I saw, and still my favorite of the whole series.  It may not be as classic as the original (note the slightly lower star rating), but it's still a lot of fun.  There's not much subtext or deep social commentary in this one, but who cares?  Even now, it's the most wildly imaginative of the bunch.  By breaking formula, and allowing the teens in this one to team up and use their various \\"dream powers\\" against Freddy, director Chuck Russell gave the series new life.  Also, the film adds a lot to the ongoing series continuity by delving further into Freddy's disturbing past.  True, it paved the way for the \\"funny,\\" sarcastic Freddy, a characterization that killed any potential scares for the rest of the series, but it worked well for this film, and I can't fault it for trying something new.    Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master  Rating: **  Boasting absolutely no subtext or scares at all, director Renny Harlin (Cutthroat Island) takes the originality of the previous film and turns it into formula.  The characters don't seem to care when one of them dies horribly, and the whole idea of the \\"dream killer\\" apparently doesn't shock anyone.  Even so, as a grab-bag of 80's pop culture, the film is entertainingly over the top.  Freddy, by this time a pop culture icon, has now lost any semblance of his former horrific self, opting instead for lame one-liners, but actor Robert Englund is obviously having the time of his life.  Character development and dialogue take a backseat to visual effects and set design, and on that level it's still fun to watch.  Just don't expect the plot to make much sense.    Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child  Rating: ***  Director Stephen Hopkins thankfully dispenses with most of Freddy's goofball nonsense and prefers eerie style over jokey dark comedy.  In this film, a loose take-off on the whole Rosemary's Baby idea, there's a subtext again, this time dealing with abortion and the rights of a biological mother.  It's rather flimsy really, but despite the film's style-over-substance approach, Freddy is once again a believable threat and a force to be reckoned with, and I'm very thankful for that.  Plus, Lisa Wilcox is excellent as the returning Dream Master Alice from the previous film.    Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare  Rating: *  Incredibly stupid sequel makes virtually no sense at all.  This film takes what is worst about the Nightmare series (lame jokes, overblown set pieces, far too many pop culture references) and makes a whole feature out of it.  Freddy's Dead is plagued by incredibly unnecessarycelebrity cameos and a director who seems to think that every single idea she has is a good one.  Despite delving even more into Freddy's past, the film can't generate enough emotional involvement from its characters to make it count.  Adding insult to injury, the final showdown, which was originally intended to end the series, is extremely disappointing (it basically boils down to lame fistfight).  This DVD set includes 3D glasses for the film's finale, but it doesn't add much to the film, and it doesn't seem to work all that well on DVD.  Pretty lousy movie overall.    Wes Craven's New Nightmare  Rating: ***1/2  Director Wes Craven returns to the film that made him famous.  Interestingly, most of the actors here now play themselves, and acknowledge that movies 1-6 were in fact movies and nothing more.  But now, the horror is creeping through the screen and into the \\"real world\\" where actress Heather Langenkamp (Nancy of the 1st and 3rd films) is being terrorized by the ghost of her famous movie nemesis.  This film-within-a-film approach allows Craven (who also plays himself) to critique the series as a whole and return it to its classic \\"pure horror\\" roots.  Even Freddy himself has gotten a makeover, and Englund once again plays him to terrifying perfection.    Purists will note that the crossover film Freddy vs. Jason is not included in this set.  Though I found that movie entertaining, I'm not particularly bothered by its absence here.    The extra disc in this set is a fun addition.  It's set up as a sort of hellish labyrinth where certain features have to be unlocked in a certain order.  You'll find tons of material about the making of the series, as well as interviews with cast and crew members.  Fans of the series will totally dig it.

I had never been into graphic novels but this one left an impression.<br /><br />Sadly I had almost forgotten about it until I heard that Hollywood was finally making the movie. I decided to pick up this book to refresh my love for the series.<br /><br />It's still as good as I remember. The world so vividly painted that I feel almost as though the alternative 1985 could have really happened. The writing style flows nicely with the graphic novel within a graphic novel. The additional excerpts from \\"Under the Hood\\" and other sources gives this something I never found in any other graphic novel. Substance. A true fleshed out story with a beginning, a middle and an end.<br /><br />I can only hope the movie lives up the greatness of this, the original source material.

For the most part, it just felt like a collection of deleted scenes (animated ones, of course) from the 2nd Star Wars prequel.<br /><br />SHORT ATTENTION SPAN SUMMARY:<br /><br />1. Anakin is a Jedi<br />2. Ahsoka is a Padawan<br />3. They both are stuck with each other<br />4. The audience suffers from a cliche overload<br />5. Anakin has to train Ahsoka to be a Jedi<br />6. They first get their both mission<br />7. The mission is to save Jabba The Hutt's son<br />8. They embark on the mission<br />9. ...they shouldn't have even tried.<br /><br />To me, the whole concept was over in the first 30 minutes. I honestly have mixed feelings about this: On one hand, this has good action scenes, and good music, but on the other hand, bad dialogue and a very thin storyline spoil the broth. I'm also NOT sure what to say about the animation. It's like looking at a painting with poo smeared in some spots. It's easy to look at, yet it's hard to enjoy when you can't take your eyes off the poo.<br /><br />It seems as if they replaced a good storyline with bad dialogue and ADD-infused jump cuts. Overall, this would work as a TV pilot, but not as a movie.
B001IL1AMW|2.0|This episode was a dissapointing disconnected drama that made little sense. The villan was underdeveloped and the premise of torture for marital bliss was just wierd and almost uninteresting. the twist with Lois and Clark was really good but they didn't take it far enough to make it meaningful.

B00000JXAK|5.0|...who listens to British folk music to hear killer basslines and drumming? I never did, until hearing this album by Trees. All the comparisons to Fairport Convention are spot on, but at the same time Trees have a very unique approach to the music. While Fairport Convention remind me of traveling bards and the British isles, Trees remind me of a medieval-folk jam session. Some of the tracks carry on a bit improvisationally, but they keep a very nice groove.     \\"While The Iron Is Hot\\" is one of my favorites off the album. The opening is deceptive, a pleasant little folk song - then out of holy nowhere you are assaulted with pounding drums that make you question if Keith Moon joined them for the track, and it turns into a cracking good rock song. The basslines are all perfect, and even the guitar work (especialy the jam on \\"Streets of Derry\\") is mind-melting.     If you want folk that combines the feathery vocals of female folk with the ballsy instrumention of a band like The Who, you need to get this album.

B001E95ZNI|4.0|Lawman Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his loyal partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are summoned to Appaloosa to protect the town from bad guy Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons).  The excellent aforementioned actors are joined by two strong actresses in Renee Zelwegger (as Allison French), in a somewhat unlikable role, and Ariadna Gil as Katie.  The relationships between this excellent cast serves as the basis for the momentum in this film.  The pace is languid, sometimes even slow, but never boring.  It has been described as a Western similar to Unforgiven.  I would have to agree with that.  It is certainly not similar to Tombstone.  This movie does not feature action packed shoot outs.  It does; however, feature excellent acting and a story in which the characters spend more time in areas that are gray than black or white.  With lesser actors, this movie would have been in the three star range for me.  With the great actors and acting, I believe this is a four star movie worth watching.  Harris and Mortensen are outstanding!
0786891181|5.0|A touching, heart-warming story of grief, its many stages and how the one you love the most can prepare you for life after they're gone.<br /><br />Holly and Gerry were high school sweethearts, newly married and very much in love when tragedy strikes and Gerry is diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor.  Holly is devastated and doesn't think she can go on until she discovers that Gerry left her a series of 10 envelopes to be opened monthly with instructions on how to go on with her life.  Holly is not only faced with finding a life without her beloved husband, but also faces problems dealing with her friends, whose lives also must go on.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters and the steady way that the plot builds.  It was so endearing to see the ways in which Gerry's notes helped Holly to be brave and encouraged her to have fun, and to even go shopping!<br /><br />I appreciated the \\"voice\\" that Ahern gives to Gerry - you realize just how much he loved his wife and although he knew their time together was going to be short, he wanted to infuse her with his total devotion and leave that remembrance even after he was gone.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Anybody Out There? By Marian Keyes, but although they are both Irish-born, their writing styles are different and they tell a very different story based on a similar theme.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to renting the movie, although I hear it's different than the book, I always find it interesting to see the way \\"Hollywood\\" represents a book on film.  Cecelia Ahern is truly talented, and I will be reading more from this author.
B0009MWAVQ|5.0|This 34 CD set is one of the gems of my collection. Originally I intended to write a longish essay about Scott Ross and his approach to Scarlatti, but having read Harold Fromm's review above I realise now that even to recommend this seems a bit risky - just as 'recommending' Schnabel or Backhaus's sets of Beethoven sonatas or Edwin Fischer or Wanda Landowska's sets of the WTC I-II. So I''ll confine myself to a few descriptive statements.<br />1) From three great harpsichord players - Wanda Landowska, Scott Ross and Kenneth Gilbert - Landowska sells best, while Ross and Gilbert's CDs are constantly removed from the catalogue. This item happily is not, since no market alternative to it existed up to 2008. I have not listened to Belder (2008), but even if this new variant is excellent, buy Scott Ross now before they remove it.<br />2) Scott R. was a great virtuoso - sometimes he seems to have three hands or more. But his playing is very natural - he never emphasised  his extraordinary technical abilities there, where he found it superfluous. When he was asked to tell his favourite Scarlatti sonata, he chose K. 208 - a slow non-virtuosic piece.<br />3) People who claim that they are bored by this set belong to one of the two categories. The most honest ones admit that they don't like motoric keyboard music at all - be it piano or harpsichord - if it does not convey a 'spiritual message' or is not combined with a literary programme. Another group of Scott's detractors pretend that they like Domenico Scarlatti but want him salted, peppered or sugared: in fact, they desire after a mannered and pretentious style a la Clara Haskil - but on a period instrument.<br />If you belong to one of the categories of listeners mentioned above in point 3), don't buy this set. Otherwise, it is an easy choice.
B001BR5F4C|3.0|There's no doubt that the picture and sound quality on Kill Bill Blu Ray is very good indeed, but it is still the cut version that has been released.  The sword fight in the restaurent is cut to black and white, also Uma Thurman removing Sophie Fatal's other arm with the Hanso sword has also been cut.   For this reason, I preffer the uncut Japanese version, because it hasn't allowed the censors to butcher the film.

B000001GLK|2.0|Immediately acknowledging I'm not an advocate of Pollini in Beethoven (belonging to those who cannot find much greatness at all in his largely harsh and unlyrical Beethoven Sonatas), I still have to say that his second Beethoven Concertos cycle is highly disappointing. His Third, Fourth and Fifth Concertos with the Vienna Philharmonic under B&ouml;hm weren't bad at all (notwithstanding the slightly bass-drained recording), featuring some rather impressively lubricate passagework combined with some uncommonly pronounced Pollinian level of commitment, if still on the cool side.<br /><br />Alas, these remakes with the Berlin Philharmonic under Abbado--in fact recorded live, which one wouldn't guess without the occasional audience noise--are about as vapid and uninspired as these Concertos can get. Beethoven's piano writing obviously poses no hurdles whatsoever to Pollini. Not sure whether or not that explains Pollini's unwillingness to engage in the music.<br /><br />You would reasonably expect the Berlin Philharmonic under Abbado to provide world-class support. Unquestionably professional, however, they seem about as unwilling to get engaged in the music as the soloist. The first two Concertos, more firmly rooted in the late Classical tradition, suffer less than the last three pre-Romantic Concertos. The recorded sound is decent considering the live format, if still nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Having just reviewed the brand new Kissin/Davis set ([[ASIN:B001B1R1EK Beethoven: The Complete Piano Concertos]]), even if with quite a few serious flaws, I would clearly choose it ahead of Pollini due to the rather successful First, Second and Fourth Concertos in general and the sparkling Rondo movements in particular. However, for a cycle without any weak links, Fleisher/Szell remains the reference ([[ASIN:B0000026GM Beethoven: The 5 Piano Concertos/Mozart: Concerto No.25]]).<br /><br />Finally, the new incarnation of this set, adding a newly recorded and previously unreleased Triple Concerto with Abbado conducting the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Youth Orchestra and with Alexander Lonquich at the keyboard, clearly offers better value at only 2/3 of the price: [[ASIN:B000XH2BJ8 Beethoven: Piano Concertos Nos. 1-5; Triple Concerto]].bbado conducting the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra and with Alexander Lonquich at the keyboard, clearly offers better value at only 2/3 of the price: [[ASIN:B000XH2BJ8 Beethoven: Piano Concertos Nos. 1-5; Triple Concerto]].
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This movie is superb, and the blu-ray edition is great.  It looks fantastic, and the bonus footage of the first 6 minutes of \\"The Dark Knight\\" is probably the best looking stuff I've seen so far on my t.v.
B000E1ZK3M|4.0|Too bad HD-DVD is dead, but if you still own a player, this is a great movie for the price.  I think those of us who are soldiers and have been to Iraq can understand this movie a little better than those who haven't.  Some of the scences can be too close to home and somewhat overbearing for non-military viewers, but helps to remind us how much of a sacrifice we made in both wars.  The picture quality and sound delivers, though this more of an enhanced DVD than a true HD movie.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Very entertaining film with some spot on acting. Denzel is always strong, and thoroughly enjoyed Jodie Foster's character.  Clive Owen was a big surprise for me as I normally am not a huge fan, but thought he was great to watch.  The film plays a bit with some rashomonesque story telling and flashes, and it's intriguing to see the plot play out.  A little bit long towards the end, but usually Spike Lee films are.  The ending was a bit too pat for my tastes as well, but very much enjoyed it overall.  Watched via Amazon on-demand as well, which worked pretty well for me.
B001IB7SQ4|5.0|Even though the science, even in theory, is mostly bogus, I find that this show is a welcome relief from a lot of what we see on television today. The characters are surprisingly well developed and well played for such a new show. And, of course it's tons of fun! It keeps you guessing too. All in all, I'd say it's not perfect, but it's certainly fun to watch. Five stars for originality, character dynamic, acting and storyline.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Comic book sequel to 2005's Batman Begins. This time Batman and his allies Police Commissioner James Gordon and Gotham City's District Attorney Harvey Dent are up against the Mob and are trying to shut them down for good, so that Gotham City can finally be free of their criminal menace. But the stakes are raised when the Mob teams up with criminal mastermind and psychotic villain The Joker, who is irritated by the fact that Batman hides behind a mask and so no one knows his true identity, and so threatens on TV to start killing high ranking Gotham City officials if Batman doesn't reveal who he is. And thus the madness begins, as The Joker attempts to turn Gotham City into a lawless hell on earth where chaos rules and no one is safe. Underpinning this film is the ever-present truth that Batman is not seen as a hero by the denizens of Gotham City but rather as an out of control vigilante who thinks he is above the law. Batman knows that this is how he is perceived, and makes it clear to D.A. Harvey Dent that Dent is the real hero that the people of Gotham City look up to, and so he must never fall and become a villain, no matter the temptation, or all will be lost. But The Joker wants the D.A. to fall and give in to darkness, to prove his theory that deep down everyone is evil, that there is no real good in anyone, and to kill off all hope in Gotham City that there can be an end to crime and lawlessness, that a better day can one day dawn. And the terrible things he does to Dent mean that he might succeed in his goals, and not even Batman might be able to save the day. A very dark and brooding vision from director Christopher Nolan, with exceptional performances from Heath Ledger as The Joker, Christian Bale as Batman / Bruce Wayne, Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent and Gary Oldman as Police Commissioner James Gordon. There are also good supporting performances from Maggie Gyllenhaal as Gotham City's assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in the first film) who is in love with both Bruce Wayne and D.A. Harvey Dent, Morgan Freeman as CEO of Wayne Enterprises Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth. The film expertly contrasts the madness of The Joker with the grim righteousness of our misunderstood anti-hero Batman and is almost unbearably tense at times, as Heath Ledger's Joker rains death, destruction and anguish all around because he loves anarchy and wants to see the world burn, and Batman seems almost powerless to stop him. Batman and the other heroes in this film struggle with their moral codes and indeed Batman is taunted by The Joker with regard to the fact that he has a moral code, whereas the Joker doesn't have one and so is free to do whatever he wants. All in all this film is an exceptional vision that has a few, minor flaws, but these do not detract from the fact that this is film-making of the highest order. Highly recommended.ie Holmes in the first film) who is in love with both Bruce Wayne and D.A.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Here's a movie that:  moves briskly, has a bit of humor, and is a beautifully-made and thrilling cinematic ride.  The special effects left me smiling.  There aren't any \\"stoopid\\" female roles (e.g., the women don't end up falling [as they run away from an evil man], getting caught, or becoming hostages that force Iron Man to make those humanity-vs-love-interest choices); instead, the main female character is smart, funny, and savvy.  Refreshing.  There's a few plot surprises, too.    This is a smartly made/directed, fun, and entertaining action movie.    Highly recommended!
0307277887|4.0|How do you make a serial killer likeable?  First, make him not only intelligent, but classy as well (Hannibal Lecter is perhaps the best example).  Next, add some dark humor, to make it clear that he is not to be taken TOO seriously.  And as a final touch, make sure that the folks he kills are unpleasant and when dead, will be unmourned (at least by the reader).  In a nutshell, this is Dexter Morgan, Jeff Lindsay's amiable sociopath who makes his debut in Darkly Dreaming Dexter.    By day, Dexter works as a blood spatter technician for the Miami police.  Every now and then, however, he is driven by his \\"Dark Passenger\\" to kill someone.  Fortunately, his foster father, a veteran cop, recognized Dexter's murderous nature early and, knowing it couldn't be stopped, had it redirected instead:  Dexter would focus his homicidal tendencies on killers and other low-lifes, using his father's instructions to execute perfect crimes.    As Darkly Dreaming Dexter begins, it's evident that he is not the only serial killer in Miami.  There is another murderer who is specializing in prostitutes; this killer drains them of their blood, cuts them into pieces and arranges the corpses in an artistic fashion.  Dexter is torn between wanting to help his cop sister catch the killer and admiring the man's work.  Complicating matters is that this unknown killer seems to know all about Dexter's own deeds and seems to approve of them.    Darkly Dreaming Dexter was the basis for the first season of the well-received TV series, and though a fun read, is actually not as good as the show.  This is principally because the show provides more detailed characters and plotting than this relatively short book, allowing the revelation of the killer's identity to unfold more gradually and logically; in the book, it seems to almost come out of nowhere.  For that reason, though I am recommending the book, it's better if read before watching the show; however, if you liked one version, you should like the other, regardless of the order.

B000P0J024|5.0|I had put off purchasing the Traveling Wilburys collection CDs because of price and the \\"unknown\\" factor. Was the extra cost of the DVD with a two-CD set worth it?  Absolutely.  For those not familiar with the Wilburys, the one-shot supergroup made history with their initial CD back in 1988.  The DVD shows how the group managed to write, edit and record the sessions in a farmhouse, similar to the jam session that Bruce Springsteen used to create the Pete Seeger tribute album.  This is a music lovers dream. Enjoy.
0143038419|4.0|I've never been a big fan of the memoir style of writing. I mean really, we all know that important people have everyday life experiences. I guess I'm generally too wrapped up in my own life to worry about theirs (I have been called insufferably self-absorbed.... I prefer to think of myself as focused on consciously evolving myself). For this reason I was reluctant to read `eat pray love' by Elizabeth Gilbert. Here is a normal person writing a memoir. I mean really. But while sitting in Borders one day, innocently enjoying an iced coffee (my new crack), it kept staring at me. Have you ever had a book stare at you? Like the way that sometimes the cat litter box stares at you. You know you should go look. You know it needs your attention. It is relentless. So, in the spirit of adventure (which, as it turns out was very appropriate to the experience) I picked it up. And almost didn't put it back down until I was finished.     The book is billed as `One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia'. The search for everything? OK, I'm in. I like a girl with ambition. The book recounts the author's experience with divorce, and her corresponding catastrophic clinical depression. She writes `I took on my depression like it was the fight of my life, which, of course, it was'. She relates the turning point in her recovery as akin to sitting down in the middle of the road, in the middle of her life, and not walking one step further until she received some help. Through a series of important baby steps on her part and a bit of good fortune (I honestly believe this is necessary to any good turning point) she winds up traveling across the globe, writing this very memoir as her job - Lemonade! This is a brilliant woman. She turned her depression into a fabulous career opportunity. Even if the book sucked, it would be worth reading for this reason alone.     As is often my wont when starting a new book, I scooted over to Amazon.com to see what other readers had to say about the book. Although it scored almost 4 out of 5 stars with over 1600 reviews, the top three featured reviews were unanimously abysmal. These three reviewers ripped the book apart, calling the author `narcissistic, needy and shallow' among other things. Wellll folks, it is a book about her experience with her divorce and her depression... one would think the focus would be rather inward-searching. Two of the reviewers were men, and it's possible they simply were not interested in what can be, admittedly, a rather girly book (During her time in Rome, the author spends a vast sum of money on pretty underwear.... and then doesn't have sex until two countries and several months later. Surely this is enough to frustrate the most patient male readers). The third reviewer was a woman who had five children, and who admitted she couldn't understand nor relate to a woman who left a marriage `simply' because she didn't want to have children. The point of the book, my dear friend, is that the decision was not simple at all.      Elizabeth Gilbert writes about her experiences with divorce, depression, travel, and spirituality with such personal style that it began to feel like she was my friend. OK, it's possible I make friends too easily, but she was so present in the book, and so relentless in her journey toward self-awareness that it was impossible not to be drawn in. She has a beautiful yet conspiratorial writing style and a way with analogy and metaphor that bring her most intimate experiences to life. During one section of the book, she personifies Depression and Loneliness as a couple of Pinkerton Detectives who come to shake her down and interrogate her while wielding billy clubs and stinky cigars. It is truly brilliant writing, and certainly the most accurate evocation of those two miserable emotions as I've ever read. Now for those of you who have never suffered a bone-crushing depression and who are wondering why you would even want to read about one, I willsay (spoiler alert!) that the book has a satisfyingly happy ending and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. Besides which, everyone knows someone who has been depressed. If you've ever loved a depressed person and wondered why the heck they can't just be happy... this book might help you clarify. Besides which, now I want to travel to Italy, India and Indonesia. I'll be sure to put them on the list of things to review.     Check out other reviews at: thecriticwhocounts.com
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I am a true SATC fan. I have seen every episode many, many, times. I've got lines memorized, and I think I know every detail there is to know about the characters. Now I saw the movie in the theaters. And just this weekend I saw the movie at home 4 times. My comments on the movie: Loved the fashion. Hiring Louise (Jennifer Hudson) as an assistant was brilliant. I loved her role and thought it fit in the movie. I hate that Big did that to her. It fits his character and what an idiot he has been with her all these years never really giving her the place she deserves in his life. But leaving that aside, the story was well developed. Showing Carrie truly grieve, and the support and love she has from her friends. I love how Charlotte hugs her during the street scene where she confronts Big. I love how Samantha feeds her at the hotel. This is true friendship. Now the part about Stanford kissing Anthony. OMG how weird. I'm still stuck on their fighting in Season 5 when Stanford is trying to show off his boyfriend Marcus. That is hilarious so it's hard for me to imagine them being together. I love Charlotte's life, it fits her. Miranda is left to believe that she is the only one with sex troubles. Why Samantha leaves Smith is beyond me. I didn't understand that really. All in all I love this movie.
045122499X|5.0|Those looking for a quick read should look elsewhere, but then, the product description could have told you that.  I read most of the text in the course of a day (with a lot of time devoted).<br /><br />This is, of course, a sequel to Ken Follett's 80s classic \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\"; \\"Pillars\\" wrapped up its characters stories quite neatly, so Follett wisely decides to keep the setting, 200 years in the future, and trace the development of Kingsbridge.  The first novel, set in the Anarchy that followed the death of Henry I, saw the area go from a monastery on a backroad on the edge of being usurped by the town of Shiring to a cathedral town with a bustling population, all under the wise guidance of the visionary Prior Phillip, while the displaced children of the Earl of Shiring struggled mightily to regain their birthright.  Since then, the town continued to grow, until the reign of Edward III, but the main characters' sacred blood and institutions have, to a great extent, rotted.  While some of the main good characters are in fact descendants of Jack and Aliena, the main line, the holders of the Shiring earldom, mostly seem to have become arrogant jerks typical of their social class (excepting Earl William, partly due to having a good wife); meanwhile, the Kingsbridge priory, which under Phillip was a force for good out to forge a new community and advance the cause of God and civilization, has become hidebound, held in the course of the novel by a series of conservatives liable to quash progress.  Both are entirely realistic outcomes, and it's a nice bit of unsentimentalism (actually, there are a couple of elements here that almost feel like Follett cynically commenting on some of \\"Pillars\\"' more optimistic moments; here, there is also a devout, hardworking monk without selfish motives, but he is ruthlessly sidelined instead of advancing to the priorship through good fortune, as Phillip did).  Even the foundations of the cathedral are flawed.<br /><br />Our main characters are two brothers, Merthin and Ralph; Caris, the daughter of a prosperous merchant; and Gwenda, the daughter of a convicted thief.  While playing in woods one day, they witness a battle between a knight named Sir Thomas Langley and some footsoldiers of Isabella, Queen-consort of the recently-deceased Edward II of England; Langley trusts Merthin to guard the location of a secret letter (as a sidenote, as an historian, I was absolutely convinced I knew what the secret was (indeed, the characters speculate about it), but I was surprised; well done, Mr. Follett), and then secludes himself in the monastery.  Unlike the mystery of Jack's father's death in \\"Pillars\\", this mystery is pretty slight, but the individual characters' stories are fairly strong.<br /><br />As others have noted, one can certainly see certain character types recurring (some, such as the similar profession and proficiency of Jack and his descendent Merthin, are actually noted in-text).  One can line up Aliena and Caris (and, to a certain extent, Gwenda); William and Ralph (although Ralph seems somewhat more sympathetic, although he is ultimately just as vile); Warren Bigod and Godwyn, etc.  The last of those is rather interesting, since he initially seems to be a good monk in the style of Phillip in the first book, and is even something of a viewpoint character early on, but he quickly becomes a ruthless obstacle.  Merthin and Caris' (extremely) lengthy, (extremely) troubled courtship is very similar to Jack and Aliena's, including each having a sojourn to the continent (apart, in the case of this novel), and lengthy periods where marriage is impossible; Caris has an additional wrinkle, since, like many romance heroines, she isn't sure marriage is what she wants, with this taking on particular significance in an era when women became property (many have noted that there's a lot of 21st century feminism present here, and that's true, to be sure, much as with most modern entertainment).  Gwenda (despite some similarities with Aliena) is a very different character than can be found in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" however, and she often seems to suffer for it in the narrative (that's on top of all her literal sufferings in the narrative); she doesn't really belong in the same world as Merthin, Caris and Ralph, all ambitious middle-classmen with big dreams success (building England's tallest structure, independence, earldom), while Gwenda, the luckless serf, just wants freehold tenantry (which is as big a dream as most in her class will ever realize).  Her narrative coequals reach epic heights and depths; she goes as low, but never gets nearly as high, and she is mostly separate from the lives of Merthin and Caris, the latter nominally being her close friend.  Through her, Follett does chronicle a revolution in the land organization of England, brought on by the Black Death.<br /><br />The first book was heavy on cathedral architecture description (something Follett has an evident passion for); there's less of that here, but a lot of talk about bridges, which is actually quite interesting.  Follett's writing style is about the same as always, familiar to those who've read \\"Pillars\\" or any of his past work; as many, many other reviewers have noted, there's a lot of explicit sex (as \\"Canterbury Tales\\" will tell you, people in Edward II's time were as randy as today), and some very gruesome violence, most notably a graphic description of a man being flayed alive.  It's compulsively readable.<br /><br />This is a five-star book; not a five-star in the way that \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" was, perhaps, but still an excellent read.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I am a huge fan of Dexter. Season 2 continues from season 1 so you really should watch season 1 first. I give both 5 stars. Season 2 has more character depth, which allows the whole cast to interact more. For this reason I liked season 2 a little better.    Season 3 is just airing on Shotime. The suspense begins immediately on episode 1, and it is beginning to build suspense. I am glued to my seat and anxiously await each episode. I think it is a great show, spartly written, funny lines. I think season 3 will get really good as it builds each episode, tension mounts. This is one of the best shows on tv, well worth paying for Shotime, or just buying it on DVD. I highly recommend Dexter.
015626224X|3.0|First of all, I love Orwell, but by the time I finished this book I have to say that I felt let down.  Paris was wonderful and exciting, but London I found to be boring and depressing.  Both were educational and in that regard, a very interesting read, but I just found Paris to be much more entertaining at the same time.  Overall, I'd say you're not missing much if you don't read this one.
B000NA77YO|5.0|Ah, the almighty Black Sabbath: originators of the heavy metal art form.  There is simply no metal band on the planet that is better or more historically significant to the evolution of rock 'n roll as we know it.  Originally formed in 1968 and taking on the name of the [[ASIN:B000UVV22Y classic Mario Bava film]] that inspired them to take a darker approach to their musical stylings, Sabbath brought gloom and doom, shock and awe, and the heaviest sound ever heard by human ears to the masses during their [[ASIN:B0000DII8S decade with Ozzy Osbourne]] as their frontman.  When Ozzy was fired in 1979, they lost perhaps the greatest frontman ever.  Where to go from there?  [[ASIN:B00004YLGU Ronnie James Dio]] had made a name for himself in bands like [[ASIN:B000005REW Elf]] and with classic rock giants [[ASIN:B00008NGHT Rainbow]] thanks to his unique vocal delivery and penchant for lyrics about the fantastic and supernatural.  His voice is now considered the definitive standard of the metal genre, copied by everyone from [[ASIN:B000063CP6 Iron Maiden]] to [[ASIN:B000FKO5DI Dragonforce]].  As if that doesn't cement his legacy, he is also the original giver of the most iconic of metal gestures, The Horns.  Add that together with the unbelievable talents of guitarist [[ASIN:B00004XR1P Tony Iommi]], bassist [[ASIN:B000000GSO Geezer Butler]], and the massive drums of Bill Ward and you've got a true clash of the titans on your hands.<br /><br />\\"The Dio Years\\" collects the best of Black Sabbath's output from the few years they played together and adds three newly-recorded tracks that prove that no member of this band has lost anything between 1982 and now, though Ward has had to bow out due to health issues.  \\"The Devil Cried\\" is an amusing tale of the damned in Hell holding a contest to see who's story could make Satan weep for them. What could be so awful that the source of all evil would pity you?  Let's just say that it's the best break-up song ever and leave it at that.  \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is their best-revered classic from this era and with good reason.  \\"The Mob Rules\\" was prominently featured in the 80's animation classic [[ASIN:0767836316 Heavy Metal]] and still rocks like a mutha.  As if all of this wasn't intimidating enough for aspiring metal bands, songs like \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" and \\"Children of the Sea\\" are epic enough to make any legendary band jealous.  My personal favorites have to be \\"Turn Up the Night\\" with it's trilling and thrilling guitar solos and the impending-doom dirge of \\"After All\\".  Here's the opening lines:<br /><br />\\"What do you say to the dead<br />Will you forgive me for living<br />Can't believe the<br />things that they said<br />Wonderful day for a killing\\"<br /><br />The music for this is amazingly dark, even more so than the words.<br />\\"I\\" is among my personal anthems; an a$zicking thrasher celebrating the power of individuality and force of will.<br /><br />\\"I am anger under pressure<br />Lost it cages, a prisoner<br />The first to escape<br />I am wicked<br />I am legion<br />Strength in numbers, a lie<br />The number is one.\\"<br /><br />If that doesn't pump you up, nothing will.  There is not a bad song on this album or any other Sabbath CD that I've heard.<br /><br />Tony Iommi is one of my all-time favorite guitarists.  Nobody is even in the same room as him when it comes to proficiency with writing dark, powerful, and memorable riffs that can be played and enjoyed by anyone.  His guitar tone is instantly recognizable and is the absolute sound of electric doom with solos that will melt your face if you are not careful.  Iommi may not have the flawless virtuoso technique of an Yngwie Malmsteen or a Steve Vai, but considering he's missing the tips of two of the fingers on his fretting hand, I think we can cut him some slack there.  Besides, how many Malmsteen riffs can you really bang your head to?  Nobody touches Iommi in that department.  Geezer Butler is right behind The Who's John Entwhistle (RIP) in terms of sheer finger-picking ability on the bass guitar.  Amazing musician.  Bill Ward was more of a percussionist than a standard time-keeping classic rock drummer.  His power and rhythmic embellishments help set the tone for many a classic.  With Dio's classic vocals, stage presence, and dark fantasy and occult-inspired lyrics, these guys were a perfect storm of metal brilliance together.<br /><br />\\"The Dio Years\\" is a great album for any fan of rock music, new to the art form or old-school to the bone.  Black Sabbath is the greatest metal band of all time and whether fronted by a legend like Ozzy or a legend like Dio the result was always amazing music that delved deep into the underworld where few bands of the time dared go.  The three new songs are as good as the thirteen old ones and I can't wait for the rumored new studio album.  Either fearing the wrath of one Sharon Osbourne (DIE!) or wishing to be freed of expectations, the band has taken on the name \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and toured together the past few years.  If you're looking to add some serious gloom, doom, and boom to your Halloween playlist then look no further.  This is top-shelf hard rock/heavy metal music no matter what your standard.ohn Entwhistle (RIP) in terms of sheer finger-picking ability on the bass guitar.  Amazing musician.

0393327655|4.0|Although he doesn't say so, Harris appears to be an atheist, most certainly in the sense that he does not believe in any traditional gods although towards the end of this book he seems to ascribe to the mysticism of consciousness in a manner consistent with eastern Buddhism. However Harris seems to assert a physical understanding of that phenomenon but maybe open to a naturalistic possibility of something more than just this life. What he is vehemently opposed to is the idea that ancient religions of the monotheistic persuasion have any clue about... well anything. Moreover he thinks them extremely dangerous to the point that they could well be the downfall of Homo sapiens.<br /><br />This book is a response from secularism to the events of 9/11 and then some more. Harris identifies that the war is not a war on terror but a war of belief. Lots of people still don't realize that the reasons why the terrorists did what they did, is because of their belief of going to heaven while everyone else they kill goes to hell. He shows why some Muslims think this is a blessed thing (suicide bombings are called sacred bombings by the news media of some Muslims nations) and how the extremism coupled with nuclear weapons is our worst nightmare and their dream.<br /><br />Harris looks at religions in terms of people acting on what they believe. He shows why religions are logically incoherent and the detrimental effects this has on otherwise rational people. He goes out of his way to show that education (lots of terrorists have attended university) does not solve this problem. He sees the trouble of extremism as religion manipulating sanity to produce insane people. Harris thinks that even moderates need to abandon religion because they just fuel fundamentalism by even being there.<br /><br />He goes through the history of the inquisition, witch hunts and anti-Semiticism. He then turns to Islam and offers a very brave critique of it. People should support Sam Harris for that chapter alone. Not since Rushdie has there been anything even remotely like it. He surprisingly does a criticism of Chomsky that will have many people thinking if the great Chomsky has his causations in order.<br /><br />After this Harris begins to deal with the problem of ethics and morality without traditional religion, what it means and fairly outlines the problems secularism is faced with on this issue. He uncovers that victimless crimes have a religious bases, not a logical one. Some American members of the government and judiciary are revealed as very irrational fundamentalists.<br /><br />Harris presents us with dilemmas that face us today such as pacifism in the face of terrorist threats, torture and collateral damage. This again deals with ethics but from a political moral perspective absent of religion. He ends the book with an outlook to the explanation of consciousness for a better world.<br /><br />With The End of Faith Harris takes the idea that anti-theism is always liberal and shoves it out the airlock. You could mistake him for George Bush if it wasn't for his passages on victimless crimes like homosexuality, recreational drug use and stem-cell research. He reveals the causation of 9/11 without the political correctness. Islam is clearly defined as a dangerous enemy to humanity. There is no cooperative deal in the offering between religion and secularism. Religion must go at all costs. He makes lots of suggestions from philosophy and couples them with political energy.<br /><br />The End of Faith packs a whopping punch and maybe the hardest anti-theist book around. It is one of the most controversial books I have ever read and renders many contemporary books on atheism harmless in comparison. How it does this is by using the KISS principle. Bible like objects can cause people to murder others. There is no way around this for Harris, just turn the pages of any scripture, really believe it and you are a potential catalyst for an apocalypse walking on two legs.  Do we disbelieve Harris at our peril? I think Harris has made an outstanding case for anti-theism and even a post 9/11 wakeup call for those who didn't get the message the first time around.

B000Y9PILI|4.0|With Stephen Stills and David Crosby having produced absolute storming debut albums in November 1970 and March 1971, Graham Nash's quietly lovely opener didn't disappoint either - in fact in the early Seventies - it seemed like everything the combined and individual talents of CSYN did was magical. This October 2008 DELUXE EDITION celebrates \\"Songs For Beginners\\" with a Remastered Stereo Remix of the album on the stand alone first disc, while the second disc is a 5.1 DVD Audio Mix (you need a DVD Audio player to hear it on) with an added DVD Interview about his Photography featuring a Gallery of Stills, Photo-Backed Lyrics & Web Links etc.<br /><br />\\"Songs For Beginners\\" was released in June 1971 on Atlantic SD 7204 in the USA and Atlantic 2401 011 in the UK. The album featured many famous guests (one is uncredited), so here's a detailed breakdown (33:47 minutes):<br /><br />1. Military Madness [DAVE MASON of Traffic on Guitar with RITA COOLIDGE on Backing Vocals]<br />2. Better Days [NEIL YOUNG (credited as Joe Yankee) on Piano, SEEMON POSTHUMA of THE FOOL on Clarinet, RITA COOLIDGE on Backing Vocals with DALLAS TAYLOR of CSYN and MANASSAS on Drums]<br />3. Wounded Bird [GN all instruments and voices]<br />4. I Used To Be A King [NEIL YOUNG (credited as Joe Yankee) on Piano, JERRY GARCIA on Steel Guitar with PHIL LESH on Bass (both of THE GRATEFUL DEAD) and DAVID CROSBY on Electric Guitar]<br />5. Be Yourself [RITA COOLIDGE on Piano, Electric Piano and Backing Vocals]<br />6. Simple Man [DAVID LINDLEY on Fiddle, DORIAN RUDNYTSKY of THE NEW YORK ROCK & ROLL ENSEMBLE on Cello with RITA COOLIDGE on backing Vocals]<br />7. Man In The Mirror [NEIL YOUNG [credited as Joe Yankee] on Piano, JERRY GARCIA of THE GRATEFUL DEAD on Steel Guitar, CHRIS ETHERIDGE of THE FLYING BURRITO BROTHERS on Bass]<br />8. There's Only One [RITA COOLIDGE on Piano & Backing Vocals, CHRIS ETHERIDGE on Bass, BOBBY KEYS on Saxophone with VANETTA FIELDS, SHIRLEY MATTHEWS, CLYDIE KING & DOROTHY MORRISON on Backing Vocals (The Blackberries)]<br />9. Sleep Song [DAVE MASON on Guitar with RITA COOLIDGE on Backing Vocals]<br />10. Chicago [DORIAN RUDNYTSKY on Cello]<br />11. We Can Change The World [RITA COOLIDGE, VANETTA FIELDS...DOROTHY MORRISON on Backing Vocals]<br /><br />The 20-page booklet has an essay on the album and its star-studded background by noted writer DAVID FRICKE - it features Session Photos, Lyrics, Detailed recording and reissue credits - and even a picture of the master tapes.<br /><br />But for fans the big news is the SOUND. The CD album has been Stereo Remixed & Remastered and the quality isn't just good - it's fabulous - BREATHTAKING.  \\"Better Days\\" has a very quiet Piano and Vocal Intro - it's spotlessly clean - and when the band kicks in - it's an absolute wow! The mastering is credited to DOUG SAX and SANGWOOK NAM at The Mastering Lab, Ojai - and they should both be Grammy nominated for it. \\"Days\\" is followed by the Acoustic and Vocal-only of \\"Wounded Bird\\" (a song for Stephen Stills and Judy Collins and their troubled relationship) and it's a lovely as it gets - BEAUTIFULLY restored. The delicately aching Cello work of Dorian Rudnytsky combines with Rita Coolidge's Backing Vocals on \\"Simple Man\\" to genuinely touching effect, while Jerry Garcia's Steel Guitar on \\"Man In the Mirror\\" adds a lot from an instrument you wouldn't expect from him. And on three tracks there's Neil Young - plinking away - putting in genuinely superb Piano work (he was credited as Joe Yankee for legal reasons).<br /><br />I find the 2nd disc, however, problematic. I don't have a DVD AUDIO player and 99% of the planet doesn't either - it's a dead format. Disc 2 features the entire album in Advanced Resolution 5.1 Surround Sound, Dolby Digital & DTS - wonderful stuff guys - if I could play it! But the really disappointing part is the complete lack of anything new - no outtakes, no demos - not even a live recording. However - and although it's completely unrelated to the album - things improve on the DVD part of the disc - it contains an interview with Nash about his lifetime obsession with black and white photography - and its fascinating - a lovely man, intelligent, sensitive - and you suspect a real peacekeeper among huge egos that often got out of hand. Then there's the gallery of images (he explains many of them in the interview) - I won't spoil it too much for those who are going to buy this except to say that there are captured moments on here of Joni, Neil, Stills and especially his lifetime pal David Crosby that will reduce some people to tears.<br /><br />To sum up - a beautifully realized first disc - with a slightly odd and unrepresentative 2nd. Still - for fans of the album - this is a no brainer - the gorgeous remaster means you simply have to own it. Recommended.<br /><br />PS: Note to Rhino - Deluxe Editions please of \\"Stephen Stills\\", \\"Harvest\\" and \\"Manassas\\"interview with Nash about his lifetime obsession with black and white photography - and its fascinating - a lovely man, intelligent, sensitive - and you suspect a real peacekeeper among huge egos that often got out of hand.

B00005JPO1|5.0|I loved this movie in the theatre and the 2-disc DVD is even better!  Maybe it is to be appreciated on many different levels--action/adventure for the kiddies, Shia for the teen hearthrob (anybody catch his attempt to put on the fedora for what it was?), and Harrison for having the guts to do his own stunts--wow, why are there not any 65-year old single, smart men like Indy in my neighborhood LOL!<br /><br />The homage played to Dad and Marcus Brody was touching and appropriate; Jim Broadbent (while certainly no Marcus) stepped very ably into the dean's shoes and Cate Blanchett and John Hurt were phenomenal.  Karen Allen has not aged a day and while part of that subplot was certainly expected by the fans, it was nonetheless choreographed brilliantly.  Neither Indy nor Marian missed a beat as they invoked the romantic spirit so similar in tone to Gable and Lombard; hooray for the old Hollywood style!<br /><br />The Indy franchise was meant to honor the tradition and format of the \\"B\\" movie serialization from the very start and it succeeds brilliantly.  Take a traditional entertainment form and honor it for what it is.  Unlike many of the new \\"superhero\\" movies that have moved beloved characters into the realms of horror and violence simply for the sake of violence (\\"The Dark Knight\\" anyone?), here we have truth, justice, and the American Way (based on sound, traditional mythology) in a format that is fun and entertaining.  Isn't that what true movie-making should still be about?
0743298039|4.0|This book is not the typical genre I'm comfortable reading, however after the third try it was a \\"go\\" and ended up being a great read. The ending was, eh!!
0385340990|5.0|I found the book informative about the Guernsey , Channel Islands.  I knew nothing about how those people lived with the German occupation before reading this book.  The author has a light hearted way of writing about the characters which makes it fun.
0312427999|4.0|Ordered directly from Amazon, got free delivery with my complete purchase, only down side is that I didn't know it was paperback because there is no complete description of the book. There needs to be a description of these things. The book is awesome though, that's what made up for eveything.
0790733226|2.0|For starters, it suffers from a common problem with modern movies: Carefully constructed political correctness. Most of the white males are over-reacting military men, not very bright political consultants, fundamentalist religious figures (some harmless except for being stupid, others terrorists), and scientists willing to take credit that rightly belongs to their female colleagues. Women and minorities, of course, are a different matter. The star is of course a brilliant female scientist. The most level-headed political advisor is a black female. The \\"flight director\\" for the machine is a black male.     But putting aside the political correctness, the element that really prevented me from enjoying this movie was Jodie Foster's performance. I guess it's really good acting. Her delivery is intense, passionate, and earnest. Really, really earnest. There are scenes where every muscle in her face is working overtime to express the -- well, earnestness of the character. Whether commanding her troops in the tracking station, dealing with less intelligent people in the multiple committee interrogation scenes, or repeating \\"Okay to go\\" over and over and over and over, she is -- really, really earnest. Watching her performance was literally fatiguing.    There was a minor character at the beginning of the movie, an Australian astronomer whom Foster's character contacts to confirm the signal they're tracking is real. He's much cooler and calmer than she is. I found myself thinking the movie would have been much easier to watch if he had been the main character.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Sirius has turned over Channel 29 to the Thunder from Down Under (Channel 53 on XM) -- the music is AC/DC 24/7. Included within the rotation are several songs from Black Ice, including Rock n' Roll train. On this album, AC/DC is going old school, with power chords and power choruses. There is a lot more space in the recordings -- not the wall of sound from Fly on the Wall through Razor's Edge. Nonetheless, Angus's and Malcolm's guitars are in your face, supported by Cliff's driving bass, and Phil's impeccable drumming -- the latter two, due to beautiful production, sound great and give the whole recording a real sense of depth. ...<br /><br />Since writing the above, (and being criticized) I have bought the album, and I love it.  One of the most pleasing aspects of the album is Brian's voice.  He actually \\"sings\\" on this album, and his voice shows a lot more range (for Brian, anyway).  Also the guitar work has a lot of variation, including *gasp* a slide guitar.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Brian-Era AC/DC, then you are going to love this album.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|If I had known the series was as enjoyable as the movie, I would never have missed a single episode, but that's the beauty of a favorite series on DVD. \\"Sex and the City--The Movie\\" was such a fabulous fantasy with such a great ending that I must see the series now.<br /><br />Four women who actually care about each other--now there's a new concept, but they actually do, genuinely, sincerely, and apparently for all time. Other reviewers have called the wedding dress a fifth character; some say New York or Manhattan itself. I say the fifth character has to be all those clothes Carrie wears, each dress costing hundreds, I'm sure. As a writer, she could afford such clothes? Wow.<br /><br />However, anyone with eyes must include Chris Noth's Big character. He is such a hunk! A major element that stands out for me in this movie is the respectful attitudes Carrie and Big show for each other. They are attentive, caring, and considerate (except for --well, I best not say). Anyone can make a mistake.<br /><br />A huge theme is forgiveness as it plays out in both Carrie's relationship and Miranda's, and in their mutual friendship. Meanwhile, Samantha learns that she is not being true to herself, an issue I just don't want to deal with. I have no idea if she is right or wrong concerning her decision.<br />The only character without problems is Charlotte, who does seem to lead a charmed life.<br /><br />Overall, this is a story that reflects real life: problems in love, friendship, living arrangements, doing the right thing, and taking chances. That this movie ends well perhaps bodes well for the viewer, too. You think? Maybe...

B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is my 1st LP Disc.  I listen to many genres and most metal/rock I hear was me being stuck in time in the 90s.  I gave this a listen & just had to get it.  I like the LP sound.  It seems ppl compare this to LPs previous release & believe its not as good.  Ofcourse I dont have the benefit of that comparison.  Does not sound lot like Rap Metal, well the metal rap I had heard was more like Biohazard etc.     All in all great album with the highlights being What I've Done & Given Up, atleast for me. Enjoy....
0684857219|5.0|I call this book a must have.   One, it's huge. Takes up a lot of space on your shelf.   Two, it's huge. It has very good photos illustrating more bodypart exercises and inspirations than most of us will ever use.   The photos are all fantastic quality with lots of inspiration.   The book is not without flaws. The routines, even the beginner routines, would put the majority of exercisers into a state of overtraining.   There also seems to be a lot of the old fashioned \\"Bulk and Cut\\" advice.   Putting heavy whipping cream into milkshakes for extra fat calories and such. Not the healthiest way to go.   All in all though, I think that the sheer volume of information and inspiration is worth these issues.   I have yet to find a single, stand alone bodybuilding book that works for everyone.   For me, the perfect routine lies somewhere between the excessive volume here, and the intensity of Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty.   But your metabolism, structure, hormone levels, etc. are not identical to mine. So learn what you can and figure out what makes sense to you.
B001DSNEJM|4.0|\\"For I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:\\"<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1.

He wakes up to find that he has a job as a caretaker at a hospital, a second chance, a guardian angel (Lambert Wilson) and the shadow of Death on his shoulder.<br />10.  Or does he?<br /><br />This is a fairly good psychological thriller if you can skirt around the plot holes and stop yourself from screaming at Garvey when he fails to do things that are blatantly obvious to everyone else, or does things that are incredibly dumb.<br /><br />Walker does a good job in the lead role, and Perabo deserves a medal for tolerance.  Bob Gunton (Rendition, The Shawshank Redemption) is especially effective as Father Ezra, the administrator of the hospital, and Wilson shows some of his Matrix mettle even though his is a relatively small part.<br /><br />A good one to rent, if only to watch Paul Walker come forth<br /><br />Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 19, 2008
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|I had this as a 4 star because of a few weaker tracks near the end, but even Back in Black has me skipping a couple and I love that album.  So after about 30 listens this to me is a solid 5 star slab of 100% proof AC/DC. Accept no substitutes.

1433502410|3.0|While the ESV Study Bible will, no doubt, serve well as a reference resource, it certainly cannot, due to its very serious theological flaws and bias, serve as the study Bible of choice for all Christians interested in a study Bible that is genuinely faithful to the whole counsel of God.     Defining Evangelicalism  The goals set for the volume are very good (p. 10) and clearly helped guide the development of the project. Overall, the notes are scholarly and evangelical. However, the description of the book's doctrinal perspective as \\"classical evangelical orthodoxy, in the historic stream of the Reformation\\" is incorrect. The reality is that the ESV Study Bible is a presentation of classic Zwinglian/Calvinist doctrine, the so-called \\"Reformed\\" theology, with the very strong influence of decision-based American Evangelicalism. It generally excludes the doctrine of Lutherans and other Christians who consider their distinctive teachings to also be orthodox.    The historical article on interpreting the Bible characterizes Luther as an important \\"German reformer\\" (p. 2564). Wycliffe and Calvin are not characterized nationally; Wycliffe is presented as the font of faithful Reformation interpretation and Calvin is presented as the pinnacle of the tradition, whose works remain popular today. So the article sequesters Luther geographically and historically.     Perhaps the oddest point in the book is the description of the Lutheran view of the Lord's Supper in notes for Lk 22:19 and 1Co 11:24. \\"Lutherans hold that the literal body and blood of Christ are present 'in, with, and under' the bread and wine (something like the way water is present in a sponge).\\"  This sponge analogy is totally unfamiliar and isn't from a Lutheran teacher. It may be an analogy used in Christian mysticism.    Articles  \\"Overview of the Bible\\" by  Poythress, reflects the best elements of the Reformed tradition; However, it lacks explicit description of the traditional western interpretive distinction between the Law and the Promises or \\"Law and Gospel,\\" as Lutherans commonly put it today. This should alert Lutheran readers to the fact that a different approach to the Bible will follow.     The next article, \\"The Theology of the Old Testament\\" by Collins, begins well with God's self-revelation in Exodus 34:6-7. However, there is a Reformed emphasis on covenant theology. The article stalls when it states, \\"The OT is thus the story of the one true Creator God, who called the family of Abraham to be his remedy for the defilement that came into the world through the sin of Adam and Eve\\" (p. 30). Israel rather than Christ remains the focus of the article. So, salvation is described as sanitation rather than justification.     The \\"Doctrinal Perspective\\" states that the interpretations \\"represent fairly the various evangelical positions on disputed topics\\" (p 11). This is not the case, as the sections below will reveal.    Weak Handling of Messianic Prophecies  Notes on Messianic prophecies are hesitant to affirm that Jesus is the undisputed fulfillment of OT expectations and that the NT interpretation of the passages is normative. (This approach sadly contradicts the good emphases in Poythress's \\"Overview of the Bible.\\")   Some examples of weaknesses:  Gn 3:15. \\"Some interpreters have suggested that by saying `he' and `his,' the intended meaning is that one particular offspring is in view.\\" Paul's interpretation of the passage is not affirmed.  Gn 22:5-8. \\"It is unclear whether Abraham is speaking ironically here (Isaac is the `lamb'), or whether he is expressing faith that somehow God will preserve his son.\\"  Dt 18:15-19. \\"In the first century A.D., Jews expected a final prophet whom NT writers identified as Jesus . . . .\\"    The notes usually use circuitous language to say that \\"this OT passage was seen by NT writers\\" or \\"has been interpreted by Christians\\" as fulfilled in Christ. While that kind of statement is true, it leaves you in the realm of opinion and interpretation, not in the realm of objective history and factual truth. It would be much better to say, \\"Christ fulfilled this OT passage,\\" period.     How can the notes not cite NT passages that directly refer to the OT passages? That silence gives you the impression that the NT interpretation of the OT is optional, or possibly not relevant. There's an article on \\"How the New Testament Quotes and Interprets the Old Testament\\" (pp. 2605-2607). But what happens in the notes is most important for the day-to-day reader.    Lack of Sacramental Theology  Despite the promise to \\"represent fairly the various evangelical positions on disputed topics\\" (p 11), sacramental theology is not presented or is dismissed at virtually every point.   The notes consistently emphasize an individual's need to make a personal commitment but fail to emphasize the sacraments as acts of God, who in mercy commits Himself to us. As a consequence, the \\"theology\\" of sacraments is human-centered rather than Christ-centered.   Mt 26:28. No comment on \\"for the forgiveness of sins.\\"  Mk 1:4. \\"Baptism was not the means by which sins were forgiven.\\"  Mk 14:22. \\"Jesus declares this is my body while he is still in his body, thus establishing a particular connection with bread as representing . . . .\\"  1Co 6:11. \\"Spiritual cleansing . . . that is symbolized in the `washing' of baptism.\\"  1Co 10:16. \\"Participation . . . Paul probably means that those who eat the Lord's Supper align themselves with Jesus.\\"  This description illustrates that the writer/editor is working within the Reformed tradition and does not even acknowledge the views held by Lutherans, sacrament-minded Anglicans, Roman Catholics, or Eastern Orthodox.      Conclusion  Readers who are looking for a scholarly presentation of Zwinglian/Calvinist doctrine and interpretation will find the ESV Study Bible a helpful reference tool. Others seeking a study Bible for their general use will be disappointed.   (The research and writing of a respectedpastor were used for the content of this review.  There are many other citations of the ESV Study Bible's limitations which could be given, but this presentation's  length is limited.  Please email or write comments if you want more detail.)
B00004CWWL|5.0|I frankly don't understand the bad reviews that the \\"Times\\" and others have given this riveting remake of the Mary Shelley classic. This is the first movie rendition of the story that comes anywhere close to the Shelley novel. True to form, the story begins and ends at the polar ice cap...as in the novel. The well-intentioned, albeit obssessed, Dr. F. is engaged to the beautiful Elizabeth. I won't give away the plot by expousing on their relationship, but where past grade-B efforts have had no female counterpart to Dr. F., this film version does; indeed, she is a prime motivator, residing at the very heart of what drives much of the story-line. There is some artistic license taken here of course, as with any great work of art. But actor/producer Kenneth Branagh (who plays the good doctor) has certainly earned the latitude. The creature, played by the forever-versatile Robert DeNiro, is such a convincing characterization that one doesn't even realize it's the \\"You Talkin' To Me\\" actor until well into the story (when that unmistakable voice comes through). For the literary-minded, this treatment comes close to the Prometheus Rising theme that Mary Shelley had intended, but which has been all but ignored in other film efforts. The old story of Man attempting to scale to the heights of God -- like the Icarus myth or even the Biblical Tower of Babel story -- is given due regard by producer Branagh. Actor Tom Hulce (\\"Amadeus\\") who befriends the young Dr. F. in medical school brings a certain innocense and a common-man's presence to the story that serve as an effective counterpoint to the madness of his friend and would-be God-man. (Indeed, Hulce's very inclusion in this fine cast transports one back to the time of Mozart, solidly grounding the story in a 18th-century setting.) Overall, a fine cast, coupled with a film treatment that's about as close to the classic novel as any celluloid production has yet come, make this effort the best of the genre. You won't be disappointed...as long as you don't write for the New York Times!

0374531269|4.0|I expected this book to be filled with descriptions of blood and gore from beginning to end and wondered if it was really worth reading.  Though the book contains its share of horrible war stories, it's much more than that.  We learn about Ishmael's life before war, and how war can creep up on a perfectly normal child.  We hear about his flight from war, and what happened after he escaped violence.  The war itself is only a small section of the book, though, of course, the war and its effects define Ishmael's life in the book.<br /><br />Reading A Long Way Gone, you learn a little about what Africa is like in peace and war and the difference between city and countryside.  Ishmael explains why he does what he does, and he is very easy to relate to and understand throughout.  Overall, it's a great read.
B001GKJ2F2|3.0|Wanted stars Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, and James McAvoy. It's an action movie, with a plot revolving around a group of super-assassins. It's got action, all right...some spectacular chase and crash sequences can be found herein. A serious movie, this is not...a group of super-rich altruistic super-assassins, as a plot device, do not stand up as a believable plot device. But, it's fun enough.<br /><br />Tagline of my own making: \\"Wanted will make you believe in the magic bullet that killed Kennedy.\\"
1416594884|1.0|John Le Carre has never disguised his dislike for much that is American, and that fact alone has never stopped me from buying and reading everything he has written to date.  I consider the Karla trilogy the best writing ever done in the espionage genre.  In fact, it transcends the genre, and \\"Tinker, Tailor\\" in particular can be ranked among the best novels of the 20th century, period.<br /><br />That said, as a long-time, loyal Le Carre reader, I have been growing increasingly troubled over his last several novels that his growing disdain for the United States has clouded his ability to produce good fiction.  \\"Absolute Friends\\" was a major disappointment precisely because Le Carre couldn't choose between writing a novel that worked or an anti-American screed; the book was somewhere in between, and it functioned effectively on neither level.<br /><br />I thought he had worked through that issue when he released \\"Mission Song,\\" which was a return to his usual, high standards.<br /><br />He has regressed - and then some - in \\"A Most Wanted Man.\\"  If writing mistakes can be tragic, this episode in a great writer's career is a tragedy.  The tragic element is that he was well on his way to an artistic success but chose to throw it away with a denouement that serves his politics poorly, his art not at all.  Over the first fourteen chapters he creates some very clever, effective, interesting characters; his plotting is excellent; the sense of place and color as good as it gets in modern fiction; the dialog borders on brilliant.  Then the resolution: unconvincing, contrived, two-dimensional, and dishonest.  A reader has every right to feel cheated.<br /><br />That Le Carre has strong political views we know, understand, and accept.  His views aren't the issue.  The issue is that his compulsion to serve his politics in his fiction cheats the fiction.<br /><br />There are a number of highly regarded opinion journals that would love to publish a 500-word essay by Le Carre on all that he sees as wrong with American politics and policy.

0312935579|5.0|AWOS was the first fiction novel that I read that I fell in love with the character.  Emma Harte is a terrific heroine.  One for the ages. I read it over 20 years ago and I have never found a novel to compare.  It's not the easiest book to read and I often had to pick up a dictionary to search for a word.  Nevertheless it is a wonderful rags to riches tale.  I will never forget this book.
B00005MP58|5.0|Of all the movies that have been made of PAP, this is by far the best and hands down the most thorough.  I give the credit to the marvelous, Colin Firth who is the quintessential Darcy.  Better than the movie with Keira Knightly.  It's worth every penny if you are a die hard JA fan.

0765316897|2.0|While I adored the first two instalments of 'Mistborn', I found this final book to be a letdown. Sanderson appears to have lost sight of the one aspect that made the previous books such a delight: the characters. The witty dialogue, interpersonal relationships , flaws and quirks that made the characters such a delight are all but missing in 'Hero of ages'.  The plot twists that began the series went out the window as an 'evil force' bent on world destruction took the stage as the series' villian.   I found the camaderie between the characters had all but disapeared, with some characters (Hammond!) being all but written out of the story. The characters in the spotlight seemed to mope about, reiterating previous thoughts and being, to be honest, somewhat dull.  I found the story picked up midway through; then shot itself in the foot rather explosively with a stunningly trite epilogue that honestly made me cringe.  All in all, Hero of Ages is a must read for fans of the first two novels~if only to answer the questions & see it through. If you are reading simply for the imaginative setting & allomancy usage then you will probably enjoy this novel; those here for the personality and brilliant character development may wonder where the characters have gone. I say they all went somewhere warm & sunny; leaving cardboard cutouts of themselves behind.
B000F39MAG|4.0|This is a very interesting proposal of Gaetano Donizetti`s great opera. For sure, the most remarkable since the famous New York revival with Beverly Sills.<br />Musical conduction by Friedrich Haider is excellent, and the fantastic cast works perfectly: the troubled couple of the Nottinghams (Albert Schagidullin and Jeanne Piland), the police-style men of Elizabeth (Steven Humes and Manolito Mario Franz), the object of love and hate of the Queen (Roberto Aronica), even the small ones as the page of Devereux (Nikolay Borchev) and the silent James Stewart (Johannes Klama).<br />Over all, Edita Gruberova reigns supreme, as it must. Brilliant. An explosive cocktail: part of the red haired Elizabeth I, part of Margareth Thatcher... If anything else, her performance worth the price.<br />The lack of the fifth star is because of the settings. Interesting idea with a hint of fascist regime (it reminds me another attempt of updating... Ian McKellen`s Macbeth) but Bayerischen Staatsoper fails on giving us a more elaborated stage (there is no reason why everything happens in the same set, and the moving wall do not works as it must).

B0012E6R3W|5.0|I've been listening to Testament since the Legacy was released back when I was in High School. After all these years it's great to still have one of the finest thrash bands around...    With bands like Metallica who were pioneers in the thrash seen back when Testament formed selling out today with commercialized garbage it's a breath of fresh air to hear a great band sticking to its roots.  This album blows away Death Magnetic in every category.  \\"THE FORMATION OF DAMNATION\\" is Testaments best work to date and is easily the best thrash album realeased this year.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Went speechless the first time I heard LaMontagne: a unique voice, not another 'sound alike'; fascinating lyrics; great music.  Definitely not the same old thing!  If you're expecting what you heard in \\"Trouble\\" or \\"Till the Sun Turns Black\\" you are not going to get it played back at you this time.  He's gone down another refreshing musical road.  Heard tracks on his website and immediately jumped on here to order the CD.  (This guy puts out a hot sound no matter what he's recording.)
0307455874|4.0|This book contains the thoughts and observations of a new Senator in Washington.  The book will become a valuable resource for historians because of its accurate observations on the national political scene in the 2nd term of the 2nd George Bush.  This book does not represent the finished political philosophy of Barack Obama but it sketches the rough thinking of the man as he began his national career.  Which may indeed make this book a milestone in the evolution of the American Republic.<br /><br />It is not as fine a book as DREAMS OF MY FATHER.  That kind of soul-searching can be done only once.  That book indeed was a coming of age saga as a young man searched for his rightful place in the world.  This is the words of the same man, now older and launched, who having found the right place now seeks for the right lever to move the world.  One will not find ideology here, only the thoughts of a pragmatic man meditating on what he finds and how it ought to be.<br /><br />Like many people I read this book for clues as to what direction this ambitious politician would take were his ambitions be realized.  I found nothing that alarmed me but nothing to hang a label on either. Then in the middle of the book, the author speaks of his mother: her lack of faith in organized religions, her passion for justice, her appreciation for the wonder of life.  This section begins on page 202 of the first edition hardback and at the bottom of the page 205 I found my answer:<br /><br />\\"My fierce ambitions might have been fueled by my father--by my knowledge of his achievements and failures, by my unspoken desire to somehow earn his love...But it was my mother's fundamental faith--in the goodness of people and in the ultimate value of this brief life we've each been given--that channeled those ambitions. It was in search of confirmation of her values that I studied political philosophy, looking for both a language and systems of action that could help build community and make justice real. And it was in search of some practical application of those values that I accepted work after college as a community organizer for a group of churches...\\"<br /><br />That statement puts Barack Obama squarely in the mainstream of American thought--our history is full of such idealists and ideas for forming a more perfect union. The great strength of the American experiment is that it produces such men and women, every so often, to renew the tapestry of our public life.  As of this writing, we do not know if Senator Obama will succeed in his effort to become President, but from this reading it is apparent that he will be affecting the course of American political life for years to come.ch of some practical application of those values that I accepted work after college as a community organizer for a group of churches...\\"    That statement puts Barack Obama squarely in the mainstream of American thought--our history is full of such idealists and ideas for forming a more perfect union.

006085880X|3.0|The Pact, was my first Jodi Picoult book that I've read, so I wasn't sure what to expect about her writing style. I was definitely taken for several loops and twists while reading this book. I did enjoy the book overall it just left me with so many unanswered questions about the characters and wondering why some of the plot was put in the storyline.     The Pact, is a love story about two teenagers, Chris and Emily, who have grown up together. Their families lived next to one another and had a close friendship, well relationship with one another. The book starts off with a bang! Right away Emily is dead from a gun shot wound and Chris is there by her side. The only question now is what truly happened? Throughout the book you learn bits and pieces from the past while experiencing what is happening in the present. The author does a good job at leaving you at the edge of your seat, wanting to continue reading on and on to figure out what is happening. Once you do come to the end of the story and find out some answers, you will still have so many questions running through your head. I feel as if the ending of this book, it almost leaves you with a whole new set of questions. I gave the book 3 stars out of 5 because I felt as if Picoult could have either made some more connections with the misleading plotlines she put in the story, or she should have just left some of them out. Overall, I would say if you have the time to read this book would be a nice choice, but it wouldn't be one of my top choices.
0385736002|5.0|What a ride!!! Picture this:     Nicholas Flammel and his wife (Perenelle) had survived and guarded for centuries an enigmatic book that contains not only the recipe for everlasting life but the means to end the world. This book is called The CODEX. Of course this amazing piece of literature is hunted by the bad guys, this time impersonated by Dr. John Dee and Co.     While living in San Francisco, the Flammels meet the Newman twins (Josh and Sophie)the four of them are suddenly attacked by Dr. Dee and the adventure begins!!!    A large portion of the CODEX it´s stolen during the first attack, only the two last pages remains in Flammel´s hands, the pages that contains the last part that will bring the elders back to rule the world.    Flammel also notices something odd about the Newman Twins, the both have incredible magical auras (golden and Silver)and with each passing hour he is more and more convinced that these are the twins described in the CODEX. The ones who will save or destroy the world.    The four of them are being chased by all sorts of creatures and animals controlled thru magic. Soon, Nicholas contacts a great ally, Scathacht a formidable warrior (vampire) who helps them escape from almost impossible situations.    The race is now set to save the world. Flammel needs to awake the twins powers and try to recover the rest of the CODEX from Dr. Dee.    It´s a great, fast read, filled with magic and some history facts that makes it even more fun to read. I recommend it for all ages.     Cheers!!!!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This movie is so funny you will...<br /><br />--pee your pants.<br />--shoot soda out of your nose.<br />--choke on your tongue laughing.<br />--go to confession bc you laughed at retarded people.<br /><br />It's risky, daring and oh, so graphic. Great camoes, too. Tom Cruise is freaking hilarious. Jack Black, as the struggling heroin addict is bloody brilliant. And let me just say that Robert Downey Jr. is a GENIUS! I've seen him in a lot of movies, but didn't realize the full extent of his talent until I saw this film.<br /><br />It's not very Ben Stiller focused. surprisingly. But, IMHO, it is to the benefit of the film. What he is in is uber funny, though.<br /><br />I hesitate to say this is a movie for the entire family (probably inappropriate for young kids), but I went with my husband, Mom and Dad and we were all ROLLING with laughter. We recapped all of the funny bits on the drive home.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0446579939|5.0|I have read every one of Nicholas Sparks books,the man is a master story teller. The Lucky One delivers, another treasure from Sparks. The details are breathtaking, the characters are so animated and real. I feel like I am standing off to the side somewhere, watching the story unfold before my eyes. I read the book in a weekend, could not put it down, I can hardly wait for the next book. Bravo Mr. Sparks, well done.

B00005K3OT|5.0|There are so many good things about this movie I hardly know where to start.  Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, and Chocolate.  This is a movie anyone would enjoy and I could not find it anywhere but at Amazon.  This is a real prize that I'm waiting to share with my daughters.
B0013D8LOU|1.0|I adore Johnny Depp. I watch all of his movies (apart from Ed Wood, I just don't get it, and I hated Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and I figured I'd like Sweeney Todd. People I worked with raved about it, but I never got a chance to go see it at the cinema.<br /><br />The DVD was a reasonable price - not THAT cheap, but not too expensive. But then what do I care, it wasn't actually me who bought it. A nice thought.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd was completely pointless. The music wasn't in the slightest bit memorable (yet everyone who raved about the movie, raved about the soundtrack). The only thing that was memorable were the various scenes of throat cutting and shaving. From a girl who has a severe phobia of watching guys shave their faces, and can't even watch the razor adverts, it probably wasn't a great idea to watch a movie that predominately features shaving.<br /><br />The only thing that impressed me about Sweeney Todd was Helena Bonham Carter. It's really the first movie I've seen her in, and she was actually really good - apart from the singing. But it wasn't just her. She wears a lot of black lacy dresses, with lots of cleavage on show to detract from the fact she was actually pregnant for most of filming. (Look out for them actually changing shape!) There's a lot of unrequited love on her part for Sweeney, and she mopes around like a lovesick teenager. Very unnerving from a grown woman.<br /><br />The plot's very boring, with OTT singing, and lots of scenes where not a lot happens. Sacha Baron Cohen appears, who manages to slip flawlessly from an Italian accent to a cockney accent, but he wasn't a particularly stand out character. The singing was unnecessary, and I simply cannot remember a single song from it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love musicals. Grease, Sound of Music, High School Musical, and there's probably a few more. But this just did not happen for me. I was continuously looking at the clock, but time seemed to move shockingly slowly.<br /><br />Briefly looking at the other reviews on the main page, everyone seems to be raving about this. Did we see a different movie? The dialogue was absolutely terrible, it seemed to be constantly whispered, and I was so close to switching on the subtitles. The musical numbers never seem to really get going or take off. They just plod along, and that's probably why they're so not memorable. Johnny Depp seems to be phoning in his dialogue at all times, and he's so bland in it. I thought he liked playing eccentric characters, not boring ones. And he's done the cockney accent in the Pirates of the Carribbean movies (please no more of those either!), I had to actually tell someone the other night not to speak in that particular accent.<br /><br />The grand finale fell flat on its gothic face. Not only was it predictable, but it just didn't match the rest of the movie. I can just imagine Burton struggling with the ending, and just deciding to do this to most of the main characters, and to hang with the subplots that are just left hanging.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd is on a whole, not great. And to top it off, I can only find a couple of reviews that I actually agree with. There's some seriously mad people out there who like this movie. Johnny Depp has gone down in my opinion.br /><br />Briefly looking at the other reviews on the main page, everyone seems to be raving about this. Did we see a different movie?

B00005JN8Z|5.0|To anyone who's interested, check Amazon Fr. and see the version THEY are getting. It makes the U.S. Edition pale by comparision. It has color stills, Books, and all sorts of goodies. It is slightly more expensive, so what. I'm ordering their Blu-Ray version as I don't see why I should wait for Easter for a ZN.1. copy, but why does not the US release have all these \\"goodies\\" too. If it was'nt for the fact that the French publicity is not in English as well, I would have bought that one. They have listed the film as being in Cinemascope, when it is in fact Standard (1:33:1) I'd be interested to see comments on this one!
B0011N1WE8|2.0|Penelope definitely seemed like my kind of movie. It has Christina Ricci in it, and it's going along the lines of an ugly-duckling-turning-into-a-swan story, which yes, has been done a million times.<br /><br />It's probably my latter comment which should have made me stay away from it. (Also the fact it has James McAvoy in it - what is the appeal about him? I don't get it.) There's just something magical missing from Penelope, which should have made it stand out from all the other movies out there. For starters, it's impossible to uglify Christina, just by putting a false nose on her. It just didn't work. She still looked as gorgeous as ever.<br /><br />The plot was pretty simplistic, so simplistic that even I found nothing I didn't understand about it. There's a lot of familiar British faces in it, so look out for them. Burn Gorman was my main one - for Torchwood fans - but there's a few other familiar faces there.<br /><br />There's not much else to say about Penelope. It just didn't work for me and was very disappointing.

B0016Q2D5M|1.0|One of the things I will always say about Brendan Fraser is, he's a great actor who is a part of some terrible movies. What is it about the guy that has him reading a script and saying \\"yeah I wanna star in that movie\\"? Does he have some form of learning difficulty, or does he do it on purpose to test how far he can push his fans before they say \\"OK that's enough\\"? One thing's for sure, \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" is one of his worst films to date. Not only is it a terrible story featuring some terrible supporting actors, but a film that needs to take advantage of the best CGI technology in the world, seems to fall short on its budget... or their CGI guy hates the director, one or the other. The prospect of what lies in the centre of our Earth is an intriguing one, and has only really been touched upon in a good way by the movie \\"The Core\\", however, this just falls short of grabbing my interest. I'm aware this is based on the Jules Verne novel and in some ways could be considered a 21st century sequel, however, it pales in comparison to the fantasy of the original.<br /><br />The story focuses around scientist Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) and his quest to find his lost brother. On the way his nephew, Sean played by Josh Hutcherson (that annoying kid from Zathura), and his Mountain guide Hannah played by Anita Briem... I've never heard of her either stumble across the Centre of the Earth. That's right, I said stumble, because apparently you just stumble across a portal to the centre of our planet. I know it's a fantasy film, but come on, you can't seriously expect my kids to buy the fact that a scientist, his nephew and a mountain guid stumble across the centre of our planet. What about the mountain guide? She's a guide, for the mountains. Has she not seen this pathway before? Maybe she has and she just forgot it was there, let's be honest, it's an easy thing to forget about in the hectic day of a mountain guide. I can't tell you anymore about the story because it's just infuriating to think about it in anymore detail. Just know it involves dinosaurs, really big plants and jumping piranha's that can be hit with baseball bats.<br /><br />I'm aware it's a fantasy film and they aren't meant to ascertain to any form of genuine reality, but I just found this film and it's sequences to be utterly ridiculous. I'm actually disappointed by Fraser and although I've come to expect him in terrible films, this one just takes the cake and I'm sure that to many this will be the film that will have his fans saying \\"that's enough.\\" I know I've come close to saying that this time around, but I'm prepared to give him one more chance. All I know is that with a virtually unknown supporting cast and quite frankly shoddy CGI effects, there's no doubting the terrible nature of this film.<br /><br />Stay away, because you really don't want to risk seeing such an atrocity.ry because it's just infuriating to think about it in anymore detail.

B0015AARJI|5.0|If it ain't broke, don't fix it.   That philosophy might not work on everything, but it definitely worked for the playstation's controller. I'm so glad Sony stuck with their previous design for their ps3 controllers, and the Dualshock 3 is absolutely wonderful.    The controller's design is more of a personal preference for individuals and personally, I like it. I've been playing the ps1 and ps2 for quite sometime now and so I've gotten very used to the controller's shape and feel.    The build quality is excellent. The controller felt solid and I like the extra weight it has in regards to the original sixaxis. The triggers feel pretty good as well.    The rumble feels good. Some people say it's not as strong as the ps2's controllers and I think I did notice a difference, but it still provides a satisfying shake when needed.    Battery Life: I didnt notice any significant change in battery life in the DS3 as opposed to the Sixaxis even though it has the rumble feature but then again, sometimes I just leave it attached to the cord.

0199536228|3.0|\\"I who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him...when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\\" This quote comes at the end of the novella, when the crux of Stevenson's point comes to a head. It is at this point when madness and reason - the forms of Hyde and Jekyll, respectively - are completely separated, and Hyde threatens to completely overtake Jekyll. It is in this last chapter that the core philosophy is revealed in all of its stunning originality. Leading up to this moment however, is an almost unremarkable detective story with stock characterizations. Albeit the imagery gives a foreboding tone (\\"The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glittered like carbuncles\\") and the narrative moves by briskly, the text as a whole isn't particularly remarkable. Truly, it is the last chapter that stands out the most, and the reader is finally able to get a glimpse of the pure evil that the story has been leading up to. Vague on details yet astute on human psychology, Stevenson has created a tale that resonates in its concept, not in its literary abilities.

B00138J83S|5.0|Film scores (as opposed to \\"song soundtracks\\") tend to get a bad rap, and the reasons baffle me a bit. To each his or her own, I suppose, but film scoring is an art unto itself, and I really appreciate the composers who can write one that not only supports the movie, but stands on its own away from the film.    The score for \\"Bee Movie\\" does just that. As Mark and Glenn noted, it's a worthy addition to anyone's film score collection, and it's a big feather in Rupert Gregson-Williams' hat.    If you're not into film scores and just want the songs, you can find \\"Sugar Sugar\\" at Amazon's MP3 store or iTunes for a buck. And if you want \\"Here Comes the Sun,\\" do yourself a favor: forget Crow's lackluster cover and get the original. You'll have to buy a CD (\\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"1\\") but not only will you get a much better performance of the song, you'll get a lot of other great music along with it.

B001CISHU4|5.0|First thing you'll hear when you put this cd in is a melodic riff pattern that is oft-used, making you think that perhaps the guys have run out of ideas... but then their traditional speedy rhythm buzz sits underneath the riff and before the song is done you've been shown that they're picking up tricks from Dragonforce in a small solo riff that sounds like Herman Li's now infamous Nintendo squeal.<br /><br />Amon Amarth have always been very melodic in composition.  They've taken that idea up a notch on this new disc... they've infused the best aspects of powermetal and mixed some great death metal into it.<br /><br />They do occasionally use some riff patterns that have been used before, but they do them so well... I would dare say that this is the 'poppiest' death metal album I've ever heard. It's nowhere near as dark as \\"With Odin on Our Side,\\" so don't expect that kind of death metal, this is death-metal tinged with power, and it is great.<br /><br />Stand out songs for me are \\"Where is your God,\\" \\"Twilight of the Thunder God,\\" and the uber-melodic \\"Varyags of Miklagaard.\\"<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Two weeks later and I must add that the song \\"Live for the Kill\\" is sublime... the classical interlude is so unexpected and so beautifully placed that it stands apart of the album as a whole and lifts this album to a height they haven't reached before.  If you haven't already bought it, get it in your hands as fast as possible!
B001AX9DT0|4.0|I've been immersing myself in Ray LaMontagne's new album Gossip in the Grain. I'm not a music critic, but I know what I like. And I like-no, love-this album. Satisfying songs all around: from the galloping, raucous, harp and guitar-driven \\"Henry Nearly Killed Me (It's a Shame);\\" to tenderer ballad types like \\"Winter Birds\\" and \\"Let It Be Me\\", this new album shows more vocal control over his first album Trouble (which is a damned fine album in its own right). Other songs like the driving, drum-thumping \\"Meg White,\\" the horns-laden first track \\"You Are the Best Thing,\\" and the folksy, down-home \\"Hey Me, Hey Mama\\" add variety to an album you can't quite classify by genre. It's GOOD music, period.
B00005JPS8|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]]<br /><br />One of the top 5 superhero films ever, right up there with \\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"Spider-Man 2\\", \\"X2: X-Men United\\", and \\"Superman Returns\\". You can really witness how much love Jon Favreau has for the source material. Robert Downey Jr. was an inspired choice to play Tony Stark, the billionaire superhero jerk with no superpowers, just a super brain that he uses to escape from terrorists. His company, Stark Industries, is a weapons manufacturer which he inherited from his father. After his escape, he changes his outlook on life and (much to the disappointment of some) the company. The film is well made, brilliantly paced, and has terrific performances throughout. The deleted scenes (from the DVD) were good choices to nix, because you can tell how they would have totally screwed up the flow of the film.<br /><br />The two-disc collectors' edition does not disappoint. It is loaded up with special features, including deleted scenes (which thankfully, didn't make the final cut), trailers, and plenty of behind-the-scenes documentaries to keep you occupied.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|When i heard about all Michael jackson's songs together in a lovely box set together with a review book it was a must. I tried all over Ireland to get it and failed all the time. Thankfully to Amazon i recieved it. I put all disc's into my stereo and pressed shuffel and off i went dancing and singing. If you are a huge fan of his music well this is the one for you. No messing, No fuss rooting for disc's. They are all together just looking at you so go on play them all. Easy peasie lemon squeezie

B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Among the most interesting aspects of this powerful story were the strong, if not subtle, contrasts. To get the niggles out of the way: many features jarred, to an extent: the dubbed singing, the easily detectable fake chin and nose, the completely unconvincing abbreviated legs. However, they didn't actually seem to matter. The story was rather simplistic, but that didn't seem to matter either. Somehow there was a truth to it, which completely escaped the Luhrmann production. Not that that was about Toulouse-Lautrec, anyway. There was an analysis of a spectrum of human reactions to the circumstances into which people happen to be born: as aristocrats who may not work but nevertheless have certain standards of conduct, as cripples who need to compensate, as prudent working women who make a go of it, as stars who can't cope, as alley-cats who sell themselves for their pimps. The performances were all perfectly good, within the constraints of the narrative. It seemed to be sentimental, but it actually wasn't. The dancing was terrific. The atmosphere might have been 50s Hollywood, but it nonetheless felt quite French. Curious final effect: the whole was better than the parts, and it's a definitely a film worth watching more than once.
B000GGSMF8|5.0|As an '80's punker turned middle age hipster (yeah, right)I find the lounge versions of my all time favourites a blast to listen to in a whole new light! Anyone with the courage to cover the DK is alright in my book!<br />I could have lived with out Bella Legosi, however...Bauhaus did so many more worthy songs to cover.
B000N6UERK|3.0|Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of our time. This film did not reflect those talents and unfortunately the rest of the cast is not developed adequately.<br /><br />The storyline of going back to prevent the future has been done many times before. The concept was a bit confusing, due to the numerous flashbacks and flashforwards, but it was also not consistent as some other reviewers point out. For instance, why was it that some things stayed the same, when Denzel traveled back, and some were different. You could argue that \\"you can't change fate\\", but it just was a bit ambiguous. And why was there no reasonable explanation of how this would be applied. Sure, the viewer could speculate, but concrete examples could have added to the story.<br /><br />Since this is a review for the Blu-Ray it is worth mentioning that the picture and sound quality was excellent. Colors were rich and detail impressive. Amazon, please add a space where we can separately rate the film, and the quality of picture and sound. Sometimes the movie is less than exciting, while the picture is.<br /><br />Enjoyable action/drama sequences, and suspenseful in parts. Give it a rent!
B0001XAODY|5.0|Short and sweet a great purchase.  Forget HD & Blu-Ray if u want to save money and get good DVD's buy Superbit or DTS DVD's.  These days sound is progressing more than picture and DTS is still the standard.  Recent movies look great and sound great espescially with DTS or Dolby EX.  This is a great example.  Oh by the way \\"Spiderman\\" 1 & 2 are in Superbit (excellent) and three is lame.
031606792X|3.0|I loved the series. I really do...but after reading Breaking Dawn, I don't know what to think anymore. I liked Breaking Dawn, it was shocking...but it wasn't what I expected it would be. I was fine about the whole baby part, but some things in the book made me wish I had just read up until Eclipse.     First off, the spark between Edward and Bella are gone. [...] I don't find them that appealing anymore. What happened to the 100 or so year old vampire who was madly in love with the shy yet daring teenager? [...] It was Bella's awkwardness and uniqueness that made other girls/women love Bella! They were able to relate to her because her life was NOT perfect. Yet the book ended so...happily. [...] IT WAS TOO PERFECT.     [...]    Breaking Dawn was an OK book to read. Shocking and the twists were very unexpected. But of course, the cliche: the heroine gets her TOO-happily-ever after. I'm sorry to the those who don't feel the same way as I do, but hey, this is my opinion.     My only regret? I should have stopped at Book 3...now the story is ruined forever.

0765316897|5.0|The first two books in the Mistborn series were excellent, but it is only in this one that Sanderson twists everything you know, and everything you *think* you know in such an unexpected, completely original direction that you're left breathless. All the little clues were there, but he planted them so artfully that they aren't even noticed until suddenly you realize the meaning *behind* what you've been reading! I've rarely read such a masterful plot.    I discovered this author by hearing that he had been chosen to finish Robert Jordan's last Wheel of Time novel. I started reading Sanderson's books because I wanted to assure myself that Jordan's family had chosen a writer who could finish the saga successfully. Now I realize that writing Jordan's last book is a waste of Sanderson's talents; he should be writing his *own* books. I positively cannot wait to see what Sanderson's next book, or series of books, will be. I also want to sit down and re-read the Mistborn trilogy over again from the beginning; the first two books will be an entirely different reading experience, now that I understand the truth.

Marc Anthony doesn't sing as well as Hector Lavoe and it sounds like he is imitating him and at least I can tell, he just is not believable and if Marc Anthony is going to sing Hectors songs he should just interpret the music it in his own way. No one sings like Hector so if you like his music buy his albums you can't go wrong!

0312427999|5.0|I am reading this book on Kindle and am about one-half through.  This book is bone-chilling.  I read a lot, and this is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read.  Even if just some of this book is accurate, it is a most profound charge against our use of capitalism around the world.  I cannot believe that a university  like the University of Chicago would allow one of its professors to use people in various countries to try to prove his particular theory of captialism.  It is one thing to try experiments in a laboratory, but to use the overthrow of a country, with the associated torture and killing, to try to prove that a theory is correct is more than criminal.  This is total evil.  It makes me wonder if this kind of thing could happen in America at this particular time of financial stress and a new election.  As I said before, this book is bone-chilling.

B000K4WLXA|5.0|Note: This review is only for Last Order, the 20 minute extra that comes on the second DVD of the limited edition. The score is not far the average main feature, Advent Children.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />The first thing that needs to be said is that Last Order, a mere extra created to sell more copies of the limited edition release of Advent Children, is actually vastly superior to what it was designed to help sell. It doesn't say a lot good about Advent Children when it isn't even good enough to better an extra, but Last Order did do what Square Enix wanted and helped sell lots of copies of the limited edition release.<br /><br />Last Order was one of the very first things I watched on my then brand new 19\\" monitor, and it was a wonderful experience. Up until that point I'd only had a 17\\" CRT monitor; one that had such bad brightness levels that it was near impossible to see what was going when watching anything remotely dark. The difference between the two monitors was staggering. But what impressed me more than my new monitor was this surprisingly high quality extra that I had discovered at complete random. The art, animation, pacing, music...everything about it impressed me. Watching it made me want to own it, even if it meant paying a daft amount just for 20 minutes due to it only being available with Advent Children.<br /><br />The story is short and sweet since it wasn't possible for Madhouse to fit too much story into 20 minutes and make it flashy and fast-paced enough to do what Square wanted.<br />Sephiroth, the best member of SOLDIER (the elite of Shinra) has gone insane, killing nearly everyone in the village he was staying in to complete a mission. This leaves Zack, another SOLDIER member who had gone with Sephiroth to learn from the best and help complete the mission, with the unenviable job of attempting to stop Sephiroth before his insanity causes even more deaths.<br /><br />Unlike Advent Children, which did an awful job of continuing the story of the most famous game (FFVII) Square have created, Last Order briefly covers the best part of the games story - the Nibelheim disaster. In the game the true story of what happened wasn't revealed in full until near the end, with a flashback near the start having mixed up the events prior to the big reveal. Last Order, however, gets right into what really happened, telling the story from the perspective of Zack; a character key to the main character of the game, and a character who barely featured in the game. The story in Last Order skips the build-up to what led to Nibelheim turning into an inferno because of time constraints, the focus instead being on what happened right after it started at the nearby Mako Reactor. The story also constantly switches from the Nibelheim events to what's happening in the present (of the Last Order story), showing Zack trying to flee from a small army of Shinra troops and the infamous Turks; the Shinra department that deals with the more dirty side of their business.<br /><br />Aside from selling more copies of the Advent Children limited edition, the other objective was clearly to flesh out the character of Zack in preparation for his lead role in Crisis Core (the prequel to FFVII), and that was accomplished excellently by adding filler that showed him to be the sort of guy who'd laugh in the face of death and protect a friend no matter what. The game did give you an idea what type of guy Zack was by including an optional truck scene (FFVII players will understand what I'm referring to) that briefly showed Zack chatting away about the future shortly before the fitting and tragic end to his story, but watching the same scene in animated form, after having seen lots of filler flesh out his character, made it much more powerful.<br /><br />Moving onto the fluff side, the OVA was as high budget as you'd expect an animation that only lasts 20 minutes to have been. The art is excellent throughout, the dark/gloomy colours set the mood perfectly, the animation flows without issue and the music is brilliant. Watching this really made me wish that Madhouse had been allowed to create an OVA with more than one episode - it would've been brilliant to see Madhouse cover more of the Nibelheim story.<br /><br />Speaking of looks, the main attraction for FFVII fans is the Zack vs. Sephiroth fight and Madhouse didn't disappoint in creating an exciting fight with very little source material to work with. The fight, which lasted under a minute, put the sleep inducing sword contests in Advent Children to shame. It was paced perfectly, with no needless sword waving/building throwing occurring, and it even had a nice little extra on show for fans of the game - a low level limit break that any fan of the game would recognise. And it's also worth mentioning the music that plays during the fight and the end credits - the music, combined with the animation, made my cheeks tingle when I first watched the fight sequence.<br /><br />All in all, Last Order is a very satisfying and highly enjoyable piece of animation for any fan of the game, or even anyone simply interested in seeing the best part of the game story without going through the game. If you want to watch something FFVII related, make sure it's this and not the flashy yet empty main feature.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10the music is brilliant.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|This was a pretty easy buy, it came highly recommended from my son who is more into EMO than I am. However, it didn't take more than a quick listen to the sound snippets at amazon to convince me. The album is really melodic, yet at the same time pretty rough and with some attitude, so if you're into that kind of EMO this is the band to invest in.

0307455874|5.0|I read this book out of pure curiosity.  It was written in 2006.  I am an octogenarian and a registered Independent.  What impressed me was that it was written by the author and not a \\"ghost.\\"   He expresses himself very well.  The portions dealing with his background while growing up were fascinating.  His grasp of what the general public can do to unite this country is quite provocative.   I have listened to many politicians who impressed me negatively with subjects of hate and one liners.  It is my concept that this man is a healer and a deep thinker.  What's more he is able to think on his feet.  Most of the politicians I have heard all my life were so dependent upon a tele-prompter that I found them, to say the least, boring.  This man excites this old man as never before.  I applaud his writings.  I recommend this book to any thinking person who wants to know this man a little more personally.

B0015I2P0Y|4.0|My history with Elbow consists of listening to samples when previous albums had come out, and finding it interesting sounding, but a bit boring.  So it was with a little trepidation that I received \\"seldom seen kid\\" from the vine program.    The first track, however, got me very excited that this band had found their inner Pink Floyd, which isn't easy to do, that odd balance between hypnotic and jarring is nicely encompassed in this track.  The next track starts to part ways with Floyd, though, and enters a real that seems to me to be 100% Elbow, a sonically-interesting, hook-having, well-played and sung \\"The Bones of You\\", which gets my vote for best track.      I got this image in my head of the cows from \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" moving out of the way to reveal a castle in which Elbow made this record, I go inside and there are ancient tapestries and modern recording equipments... but as the album progressed, the scene changed to some kind of exotic liquor commercial.  Like this album wants to be your companion as you buy $23 martinis and tuck your iphone into a crushed red velvet jacket....      Which is a bit absurd, of course, because the band probably intended no such thing.  By track 9, \\"Some Riot\\", the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" vibe has returned, but is washed away by the up with people epic \\"One Day Like This\\".  And its eerie effect feels wrong following a spy-movie sort of track like \\"The Fix\\".  I like that the band isn't afraid to dip into genres outside what you might expect, but it feels a little bit too nod-and-a-wink to me.  Like someone was shopping the songs for film tv and commercials before the digital ink was even dry....    Maybe this is a band with 7 toes in the Coldplay/Keane pool, 1 toe in the Pink Floyd pool, and 2 toes still polling as \\"Decline to State\\".      I should also add that I think the singer, Guy Garvey, has a great voice, he sounds like a British 'everyman', but with a grit, warmth and range that's very appealing, albeit he comes off abit of a showoff at times, taking me out of the song and into look-at-the-singer land....

0385751532|5.0|I ordered this book without being sure what to expect.  When I got it, I read it all in one night, as I couldn't put it down.  Seeing the horrors of the Holocaust through the eyes of a nine-year-old boy puts a twist on it that I'd never thought of before.  The story pulls you in, you can't help but feel for Bruno and Shmuel.  The author does a wonderful job of writing with a child's naive perspective.  The ending has a horrifying twist that I wasn't expecting, but I think it made it more touching and poignant to NOT sugarcoat things.  a very touching story of love, friendship, and heartache during a very dark time in the history of humanity.  Excellent.  Highly recommended.
B001FEA9QU|3.0|Master of Puppets was the soundtrack of my youth. A week hasn't gone by since it came out that I haven't listened to it begining to end. I haven't been a fan since they hired Motley Crue's producer and made that Motley Crue album that they called the Black album. Then they made thier Use Your Illusion I and II and called them Loads. Then they made whatever the hell St. Anger was. I didn't expect much from this album.    Shockingly, it's not bad. It sort of sounds like what logically would have followed Justice. The bass could be louder and better. Trujillo is seriously dumbing his playing down. It's obvious that Lars needed Pro Tools to get the drumming in time but it's great to hear Hammett shred again. Maybe they can pull it all together on the next album.
B00151G08Y|4.0|In the years building upto \\"In Silico\\" Pendulum has changed drastically. Not just the style of the group, but the band itself. Pendulum went from 3 members to 6! This being said, their newer music incorporates many different styles of music. More collaborative. I love this cd, and I think it's great, but it is really different then \\"Hold Your Colour,\\" which was a complete stroke of genius. Instead of playing raves, pendulum is now playing concerts. Visions, the Other Side, Grantie, and Show down have to be some of my favorite tracks on this cd. There is not a song I didn't like on the cd. But I do not think I would classify it as Drum and Bass or the previous Jungle category that pendulum would fit into. New pendulum is a style of its own. Bringing more pop, rock, and hip-hop elements into their music. Also, not to mention all of the singing.   Bottom line: This is a great cd, but if you're buying it because you are a pendulum fan, you might be surprised, or even disappointed.

B0002PZVH0|4.0|Luis Mejia - Ambient 1, as it's title carries, was the first concrete ambient work by Brian Eno, the later all time genious of the genre and maybe the only one to figure this out in popular mainstream. His experimental rock pieces used to be graceful and witty, but jet you couldn't stop noticing how those flamboyant experimental sounds could get you in such a profound aura. Music For Airports is an excellent and digestible piece; it's simple, quiet ambient, tape-loop serenity and fragmented changes and slight divisions. With maybe 3 or more pieces of sound, Eno makes the atmosphere not only valuable but enjoyable, and the album passes quickly through your senses. Although, for the airport theme, 1-1 is the master of a hughe number of atmospheric pieces, it settles you down onto the airport carries you through a very non-publicitary attraction, and drops you off to your visit fresh and new. Instead, my disgust with the other pieces is that they sort of \\"break off\\" the airport tie; with 2-1 being a repeating chorus-like sequence (not bad at all) it sounds as true ambient ground foundation, and just the later 1-2 has a more subjective, even catchy beat; 2-2 is the palpable combination and resume of the whole work, each subtle and nice, but again, it doesn't sound so much \\"airport-like\\". We all may have experienced the later much more workful pieces, true modernist works of art, but still Ambient 1 will get you there; make you understand some things about the music, and leave you under the pressure of taking a nap or remain in silence for a while. Considered masterpiece.

1416594884|3.0|The spy genre's undisputed master, Le Carr&eacute; has been floundering a bit since the end of the cold war, producing intelligent, complex, but not particularly compelling novels. Unfortunately, the trend continues.<br /><br />His latest focuses on an enigmatic, possibly addled, Chechen-Russian Muslim, Issa Karpov. Karpov remains a fairly repellant/pathetic cipher, but his illegal appearance in Hamburg, Germany, is a catalyst for crisis in the lives of those around him.<br /><br />Skeletal and ill, he throws himself on the mercy of a working-class Turkish family who, although frightened of attracting suspicion, cannot refuse to help him. Then there is the crusading young lawyer, Annabel Richter, who burns to help. Having previously lost an innocent Muslim to the maw of rendition, she's determined to atone by saving Karpov.<br /><br />Her first act is to contact the British proprietor of one of Hamburg's most respected private banks, Tommy Brue, 60, lonely, wealthy and above reproach. Brue's bank holds Karpov's legacy - an account left him by his father, a brutal Soviet apparatchik who, together with a small circle of friends, deposited money with Brue's father. Known as the Lipizzaner accounts (for horses born black that turn white with age), these shady funds have always disturbed the younger Brue, for whom they remain a blot on his father's otherwise pristine character.<br /><br />Brue is quickly, naively drawn in to Richter's plans. He is bored, she is attractive; and the money is Karpov's, after all. But Karpov has already attracted attention. Rival factions of spooks are homing in on him - including the crass Americans, the ambitious Brits, the compartmentalized Germans and the new, decompartmentalized Germans. At the head of the pack are the brilliant, inscrutable team of Gunther Bachmann and Erna Frey, temperamental opposites with professional precision and &eacute;lan.<br /><br />The novel is predictable and the characters are more stereotypical than the usual Le Carr&eacute; crowd. But mostly, the story never heats up. While any Le Carr&eacute; novel is worth reading, this one doesn't possess the power, depth or subtlety of his George Smiley books.ts up.

B00009L1TA|4.0|This movie was really good. Some people just don't appreciate these types of movies. After reading some of the other reviews, I can understand how some people did not like this movie. Some of the twists and events are fairly farfetched, but all movies are like that. If you go into a movie pessimistic than your bound to dislike it. I did like this movie very much, and I thought it had a lot of qualities that made it a very compelling story. The character played by John Travolta is a quick-witted DEA agent who doesn't follow the rules and is hard on the bottle. His counterpart, the character played by Connie Nielsen, is the exact opposite; a very by-the-book kind of person who never deviates from her objective. Together, they have the task of finding out what happened to a group of army rangers during a training exercise in the jungles of Panama, where only one of them returned. This movie reminded me of Courage Under Fire, another war drama that involves the lengthy investigation of the deaths of soldiers during an unknown event. If you liked Courage Under Fire then you will love Basic because Basic has more action and great actors like John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. This movie has so many twists that you have to pay attention to every second of the movie, but that's easy because the movie is so intensely entertaining. You may not get the story the first time watching the movie but the second time you will and you'll be glad you did. Another winning quality of this movie that had me going was the grade-A cast. The entire cast was spot on in the movie and every word and action was totally convincing and compelling. I didn't even recognize one of the actors in the movie until the very end, when she was in civilian clothes. That's how well they were played. Every movie that Samuel L. Jackson is usually good because he is such a unique character and I thought he was excellent in the movie. If you like Samuel L. than you'll like this movie because he acts the stereotype of the sadistic drill sergeant to the bone. Overall I thought Basic was a superb movie with its ridiculous twists and witty remarks. You cannot go wrong renting this movie, and after watching it you will be that much cooler.
B00005JPO1|1.0|While interviewing Gillian Anderson on Late Night many years ago, David Letterman heard a synopsis of the X-Files and said, \\"Basically, you're running around chasing after space monkeys!\\".  Too many years later, Harrison Ford is reduced to doing the same thing. As an added bonus, they managed to take all the fun out of the movie too. Good grief. Let's pray they don't try another Star Wars with Han Solo.

B00006JDSI|5.0|This is by far my favorite Dracula movie.  It was not copyrighted and was ordered to be destroyed in 1923.  It didn't happen for many copies.  This is a great movie and it would have been a tragedy to lose.  Way back in the day when 8mm home movie projectors were in vogue and my mother was a public librarian, my brother and I used to take the 8mm version of the movie and play and play it again.  We loved it and I continue that infatuation with the movie to the day.  This is great DVD version with tinting, wonderful music and a wonderful print.  The extras are terrific too.  I'm glad I got this DVD.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|...about whether we have or have not caused harm to our planet.  The movie is not heavy handed nor does it attribute much blame to any one group. It's just a good, quality disaster flick that is fun to watch.  Most disaster flicks kind of suck but I've actually watched this several times and I can't say that about many movies.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy.  Oh, and this is best to watch on a cold day...just adds a certain ambiance that lets you associate with the characters more.
B0014VPFTA|4.0|Continuum \\"continues\\" Mayer's evolution as a music artist.  You will recognize his radio-played tracks, but once again, there is a lot more (and in my opinion, better) songs within the album.  Truly a free-spirit singer, he speaks his mind while setting his thoughts to jazzy and acoustically pleasant and/or relaxing tunes.  Thank goodness that the pop-singer unoriginality bug hasn't caught him yet.
B000NA28I4|1.0|When I heard that film-producers had bought the rights to turn Eragon into a film, I was excited but skeptical. Most book-to-film transitions are rough and unsuccessful - they neither impress the dedicated fanbase of the books or those who had never heard of the book and just wanted to watch some action.  When it came out, I heard such terrible reviews of it that I thought there was no way I would ever pay to see it. And so Eragon the Movie was 'out of sight, out of mind' for sometime.  Until the night that my sister and I stumbled upon a showing of it on HBO while we were flipping through channels.  It.  Was.  Garbage.  Pure and simple - that was the verdict from me, the avid Christopher Paolini reader and my sister who hates all things long and written.  Some of the dialogue was too over-blown, stepping over the line of dramatic and well into corny-land. I wanted the film to stay truer to the book, my sister just wanted to understand what the hell it was that she was watching.  It made for a bad viewing experience.  Do NOT buy this.
B001676320|4.0|Just what we need, another bunch of aging rockers from the 60's and 70's trying to cash in on the nostalgia boom. Well, that's what it seems on the surface. Delve a little deeper and spend some time with this Blu-ray DVD and you'll discover a musical excellence that transcends time and generational change. Both groups have an infusion of youth (not surprising as some of the original members have gone to that great concert in the sky) but maintain the original sound albiet with much greater fidelity than was originally possible with 70's audio technology.   There are two reasons to buy this Blu-ray DVD, firstly the picture and sound quality are almost reference level (I own a HiFi store and use it for demo and system set ups), secondly the musical performance is just brilliant with band members of both groups interchanging and singing each others songs. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that there are some lulls in the performance although judicious use of the remote can soon dispatch them.  All in all this is a disk that anyone with a musical bent and good audio/video system should consider adding to their collection. Regardless of musical taste, you won't be disappointed.
0060574216|5.0|I got this book to attempt to understand the differences between men and women after repeatedly beating my head against a wall in my dealings with the opposite sex.     I found it extremely insightful into the way each gender thinks, and understanding what my partner wants will definitely be useful in all of my future relationships.     I strongly recommend that if one partner reads it, they both should.     There were a couple of remarks (ie: about the woman's kitchen) that I found a bit bemusing (I'm female and I loathe the kitchen). But they hardly mar the book's quality.     Go on! Read it!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I saw alot of these reviews on here before I brought the album and I was honestly about to bypass this amazing work in Sams Club but I took a lead on faith and purchased and enjoyed. I feel like I'm being harsh giving her only 5 stars because got damned this album is a keeper. And contrary to most folks I think Pocketbook is the sassy part of Jennifer Hudson that we need to see. Hey even keyshia has her Beyonce monents

0596101996|5.0|I've learned a lot of tech in my time, and this book does the best job explaining the fundamentals of a language that I've ever come across.  Flanagan basically builds the whole language piece by piece, explaining the fundamentals of every aspect.    There are some more esoteric techniques he doesn't cover, but I hardly consider that a shortcoming; aside from those, he basically covers the entire breadth of JavaScript, both in its core design and in practical browser-based applications.  This really is the definitive book on JavaScript, even if it is two years old (which is ages in Internet time).
B000WQWPKA|4.0|Independence Day is a comic book movie and is best enjoyed watching it with that mind set.    The Blu-Ray version of this movie is amazing although I was disappointed to see a black dot artifact hanging around on the upper left portion of the screen during the opening and for the first several minutes of the movie.    But overall, it is a good transfer and the sound is incredible.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and play it constantly!!!! I am going to buy their entire collection!!! I loved it so much I even bought the DVD and have been watching that!
B000008B01|5.0|YES!YES!YES! to every other review! it is  perfect, beautiful art.<br />When it first came out (the LP), it came with a sticker on the cover...\\"The Best Bossa Nova Album Ever\\"...it still is. When invited to dinner, instead of the bottle of wine as a gift, I brought this. Much Better Than a Bottle of Wine.
0316067598|5.0|a must read, not for the quality of the writing but for the amazing story it tells.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|A vastly improved print compared to the dark-shaded 2001 DVD Box Set.    You will have the exact same viewing experience as you had when viewing in theaters on the big screen back in the 1970s.    I've read recently that Director Francis Ford Coppola has seen the restored version and is extremely pleased with the results.    A pristine restoration of the greatest movies (Godfathers I and II) ever made!
0596522347|5.0|Only since I've purchased Presentation Zen have I've been so changed by a book about presenting, education, and sharing ideas with others.  This book is about the mechanics of assembling a better presentation; who better to write it than the queen of presentations, Mrs. Nancy Duarte.  Just one of her claims to fame (and a rightful one at that) is designing the slides for An Inconvenient Truth, presented and turned into a movie by Mr. Al Gore.    I only wish I could afford to drop off copies of this book at the desk of every colleague that I interact and present with at DOSUG, DJUG, and beyond.  The transformation that the ideas contained in this book would have on their presentations is simply phenomenal.  Nancy builds incrementally on each step in the book, taking you to better and deeper approaches to improving your presentations.  She gives away her insider secrets on assembling slide order (spoiler: post it notes, used in creative ways + thoughts about snow globes), and what to put (and not to put) on your slides.  You'll be surprised what she tells you to leave out.    If you are a casual or professional presenter you owe it to yourself to buy a copy of this book.  Your presentations will be transformed to a higher level of training for your audience.
B001BWQ0N2|3.0|i was disappointed.  I really like the bands earlier material and I felt this was an attempt to reconnect with their earlier roots, but somehow it fell short for me.  I need to listen to it more and see if it grows on me, but so far no.  I like the longer songs, which seems to me they were recording for themselves, not the radio industry.  It's still Metallica...
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|This DVD performance has a way of drawing you into the story so that you feel that you're on the stage with the performers. The singing and acting are superb but the quality of the recording is deficient. Camera angles and framing detract from the total enjoyment. Lighting is poor and obscure. If you want the feeling of sitting in the balcony watching the opera, this is for you. I, for one, don't want to be distracted by seeing more than what's happening on stage. Granted, the video/audio technology of the time is nothing compared to what we have today, but the amateurish camera work is independent of that. The performance deserved better treatment.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I've been a fan of this series since season 1. While I enjoy the stories told each week, the thing I like most about this series is the familial dynamic between Sam and Dean. Always good for a laugh.
1579126278|3.0|To tell the truth I was excited to read this one because I had heard of it a million times and it's one of the classics. But when I read it, I didn't like it nearly as much as I had hoped. I guessed the ending very early on simply because people kept telling me how much of a surprise it was. It was ok but I think the most important part of any book is scenery, so for me this wasn't that great.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've been a fan of old school Metallica for many years. Although I did like the Black Album a bit, I felt that they were going in the wrong direction. My suspissions were correct as the horrible Load, the awful Re-Load and the completely unlistenable St. Anger were released. When this album was announced, I had no intention of buying it, or even giving it a chance. I heard the song \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" on the radio one day, and although the first half of the song sounded like something from the Load album, the second half of the song gave me hope that Metallica (the real Metallica) were returning to form. Once I picked up the album and popped it in, I was pleasently suprised to hear the kings of thrash metal actually playing thrash metal!!! This is by far the strongest release from Metallica in over 20 years. Perhapse the addition of Robert Trujillo on bass and the absence of Bob Rock producing had a bit to do with it. I've been a fan of Trujillo since his days with Suicidal Tendancies, and had hopes that he would help Metallica come back to doing what they do best. It definately worked. Death Magnetic totally shreds from start to finish, and although not as good as their releases from the 80's (Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All), it is a return to the style that they helped create. The album sounds like it should've been the follow-up to Justice. It has some of the elements of the later years, but only really in the vocals. The lead guitar is back, as is the double bass. I was begining to think Lars and Kirk had forgot how to play, but this album has the sound that made me love Metallica in the first place. My only hope is that when they do their next album, it's even louder and heavier than this one.
0425200450|5.0|I read this book on a long train ride and I enjoyed it. I find it very odd that this was the first book I ever figured out the ending to though. (the other odd part is that the second book I figured out was Murder of Rodger Ackroyd but the rest of the books I couldn't figure out) So my point is, I don't know if it's easy to figure out or if I just had a lucky guess, but either way it's worth the read. The setting and characters were interesting and for a lot of the book I was sitting there reading reasons that changed my suspects and then changed them back. This is defiantly one of better Christies books. Not my favorite but still very good. It really zips along.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I am a die hard fan of the Indiana Jones series, so when Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was announced, I was very excited to see it. In anticipation, I watched several documentaries on crystal skulls so I would have the background on the subject matter before the film hit theaters. Knowing that many theories of crystal skulls are that they were not made by human hands, or possibly aliens, I was prepared for what many thought was a dissapointing end to the fourth Indy film. The action in this film was very much the same calibur as the previous 3 films. I agree that this film wasn't as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, but I did find it better than Temple of Doom.

1582701709|3.0|The product was an easy read. Although I don't completely believe in a lot of the opinions in the book, it does have some optimistic things in it to improve the way you see things and your way of life.  Looking back I'm sure I could have found this book cheaper in a book store as the shipping costs were way to high. I did upgrade my shipping to expedited, but it was not worth it as it maybe saved me a day or so in delivery! Even then the regular shipping costs were only about $2.00 less which was still to much.  If you plan to order this product make the shipping worthwhile and order a few different things and bundle your order to help offset the shipping costs.  Book came on time as requested, which when I received the date via e-mail I thought it was to long for shipping. Also came in good condition.
0756404746|5.0|This book is fantastic.  Great story - great characters - unique.  I burned through it in 5 days, and now I have to wait 8 months for the second one.  I plan on reading it again in the near future.
0521673763|5.0|The new edition of Stahl's... is amazing. It keeps the same friendly and easy-to-read texts and figures, but is much more complete in its subjects.  I'm very glad to had adquired this book, no doubt its going to improve my understanding about neurobiology/psychopharmacology. For sure, an outstanding masterpiece!
0060989157|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. I had just finished 'Slash' and thought that this book could not come close to it. I was wrong! It's amazing the lifestyle these guys had. Not only do you get an inside look at all the craziness, but you also feel like you get to know them personally. Awesome book!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Fantastic Movie! I have watched it several times since receiving it. I ordered the movie two days before it was released and received it in the mail the day of release. I was so excited it came on time.
B00005M91K|5.0|This piece sneaks up on you. It mesmerizes from the first few seconds and sweeps you into the world, and I mean the whole world.

1559211407|3.0|This book is a collection of a series of letters exchanged by the author, Helene Hanff, a New York writer, and the employees, though primarily Frank Doel, of Marks & Co, a London-based antiquarian bookseller. These letters occurred over a period of twenty years from 1949 to 1969.<br /><br />This book of letters is special because it captures so well the passion that both the author and the company had for rare and classic books, not to mention the friendships that were engendered because of that shared passion. The author demonstrates by far the most emotion as she both chides Frank for his failure to either obtain a book or his sending an inferior version and sings his praises for sending along an especially pristine version of a finely crafted classic. The author softens her sharp letters by shipping tins of meat and eggs during a period when such were being rationed in England.<br /><br />The question arises as to whether all of this constitutes a love story. The author herself writes that Frank would likely not like her writing \\"love\\" letters to others at the firm and that furthermore only he understands her. Perhaps the question is irrelevant - obviously high regard existed. The author constantly made tentative, unrealized plans to visit England and the bookstore, but when her friends visited, they were practically mobbed by the employees as being representative of Helene.<br /><br />The relative merit of the book is difficult to judge. Only scraps of information about the individuals involved are conveyed; there is little in the way of discussion concerning ideas. The book conveys best that our connections with others can originate in the most unusual manner, especially if we are open to them. Helene could not possibly have known that a simple request for books would evolve into a lifetime of heartfelt communication. One would not necessarily have to be a book lover to appreciate the book.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|I first bought this book in paperback form at the PX  while stationed at Fort Hood. It was a long and outstanding read! I understand that there are some things that Mr Mandela may have decided to leave out i.e.: his linking to various political uprisings against the aparthied government. I wish that he would have discussed that part of his life more. Nonetheless, this book tells the story of a man who came from humble beginnings to become the first black president of post-aparthied South Africa. I had to buy copy of this book for the Kindle. If you want a piece of modern history, and a good long read as well, get this book. I recommend it to everyone!
B0017098GO|5.0|I was very impressed with this book! I won't repeat the synopsis as so many have done a great job at that already. This was a fun and interesting read. It was unique, but if I had to compare it to others in the genre it would be something like \\"if Gene Wolfe wrote the Belgariad\\" or something vague but interesting like that.  Hmmm...or maybe \\"a Marvel comics version of the Wheel of Time\\". The imagery was great and I could almost see the graphic novel version as I was reading.    Since the sequels are out for Kindle now....I'm off to pick those up too!

B001DHXT1G|4.0|Marvel Comics' raging green powerhouse returns to the big screen in the entertaining summer thrill ride \\"The Incredible Hulk\\". For five years, scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has kept hidden from the world while searching for a cure to his gamma-irradiated DNA that transforms him into an unbelievably strong creature known as the Hulk. Banner struggles to control the raging power within him and prevent the US Army from turning this power into a devastating living weapon. Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 1 & 2), \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is a fast-paced action-packed adventure that succeeds over the previous 2003 film. The latest comic book adaptation offers plenty of excitement and well embraces the popular 1970's television series. The climatic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is really exciting. \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" also stars Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and Academy Award-winner William Hurt, and features cameos by series star Lou Ferrigno and comic book creator Stan Lee.<br /><br />With its stunning picture quality and intense audio, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" packs quite a punch on Blu-Ray. The 2008 comic book movie is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The Blu-Ray has a nicely detailed and remarkably sharp video transfer. Its 5.1 DTS-HD audio is really dynamic. The special features include 40 minutes of deleted scenes, a comic book picture gallery, alternate opening sequence and a feature-length audio commentary with director Louis Leterrier and star Tim Roth. \\"The Making of The Incredible Hulk\\" documentary offers several interviews with director, cast and production crew. It also includes four short behind-the-scenes featurettes: Becoming the Hulk, Becoming the Abomination, Anatomy of a Hulk Out and From Comic Book to Screen. Overall, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" gets a \\"B+\\".
B001GAOY5U|3.0|It's way cool that this 3d movie is being released on Blu-ray in 3D!  That makes this a purchase, rather than a rental.  But what about households with more than four people who want to watch it?  Seems kind skimpy to only include four pairs of glasses with no way to get more -- and to use a version of the glasses that are not compatible with other 3d movies out there like Tom Hanks' little train movie.<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is, though, after watching this, I gotta say the 3d version looks weak compared to the 2d version.  The story doesn't improve by ditching the glasses, but at least it looks better.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. I've watched it many times. The special features on this disc are very good also.

B000000OAA|4.0|Queen rushed into the studio after [[ASIN:B000000OBJ Queen II]] when it became clear that Brian May (who had fallen ill) would be unable to tour for a spell. His sickness was our game, as \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" was the album that gave Queen their first taste of major American success. That was due to the breakthrough of \\"Killer Queen,\\" a flawless slice of trashy glam that featured Freddie Mercury's soaring falsetto and Brian May's wild guitar tones. The iconic four finger snaps that open the song were instantaneously lodged into your brain once Mercury hit the first lines:<br /><br />She keeps Moet et Chandon in her pretty cabinet<br />Let them eat cake she says, just like Marie Antoinette.<br />A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy<br />At anytime an invitation you cant decline.<br />Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette<br />Extraordinarily nice.<br /><br />\\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" contained a few other eye openers, one of which was Roger Taylor's first great Queen song, \\"Tenement Funster.\\" \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is one of Queen's hardest rockers, so much so that Metallica covered it on [[ASIN:B00000FCBC Garage, Inc.]]. Only the song \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" - oddly enough on the [[ASIN:B000000OAC News of the World]] album - came close to SCC's ferocity. Yet, right near that is the ragtime take on \\"Bring Back Leroy Brown.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" previewed the crazy diversity that Queen would perfect on their next album, [[ASIN:B000000OAN A Night at the Opera]]. If it weren't for a few bits of filler (\\"She Makes Me,\\" \\"Misfire\\"), this would have been a five-star disc. But as such, 1974's \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" continued Queen's rise to the top of the 70's rock scene.
B00005K3O4|4.0|[This review is part of my 31 days of Halloween series.]<br /><br />When I first saw this movie it was on TV so the formatting issue isn't as important to me as it appears to be to other reviewers (check out the single star reviews.) I suppose it could benefit by letterbox reformatting. As for other \\"poor\\" rating reviews, come on, guys--its called KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE, not FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked it.<br /><br />The movie definitely has all the \\"B\\" level hallmarks--less than stellar acting (except by the Klowns who are perfect), a script full of holes, etc. But somehow, the film works almost in spite of itself. The art direction was great, particularly in the use of color--and, again, the look of the Klowns who are perfect. They had huge goofy heads & sets of really nasty looking, evil teeth. The \\"tricks\\" they play on the unaware towns people are a treat to watch.<br /><br />For the price, you can't miss--and it's Kid Friendly.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000BO1JLY Transylvania]]<br />[[ASIN:B0009ETD28 Asian Cult Cinema: Extreme Horror Collection]]<br />[[ASIN:6305808198 The Mummy's Shroud]]<br />[[ASIN:B000AM6OWQ Cult Fiction]]<br />[[ASIN:B0006FO56Y American Gothic]]
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|It would be safe to assume that even a band like AC/DC would have rough patches while attempting to crank out new material after eight years between studio albums.<br /><br />But retaining the enthusiasm from back in the day that sometimes found the band playing two gigs a night at different bars, Black Ice shows no rust or taking the easy way out by cruising through stale riffs. The first single, Rock 'n Roll Train, and its B-side, War Machine, easily lodge themselves in comfortable slots as some of the strongest numbers the band has ever recorded.<br /><br />While the on-stage antics of Angus Young may oftentimes overshadow his work, the side guitar on Stormy May Day shows an artistry that has been in the forefront of his musicianship for many years. Other top cuts include Spoilin' For A Fight and the title number, with Brian Johnson as strong as ever in belting out the lyrics.<br /><br />In an era where Classic Rock is a museum piece on tired FM formats, AC/DC unleashes a frenzy of fire while showing that they are not too old to rock-n-roll.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|A Truly Great SF Book. Humor and Battle and Great Characters. This guy knows how to write!
B00005JPO1|5.0|...for making imaginative, high quality, and family fun entertainment that we're used to viewing.     I was ten years old when \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\" was first released and I was blown away. What a thrill it is to enjoy a fresh, new Indiana Jones movie all these years later.    In \\"Indiana Jones & The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull\\", Harrison Ford plays a gracefully aged Indy with stern confidence and wisdom of the years. What more can we expect from such a colorful character of fantasy that has had so many incredible adventures. Once again, Indy teams up with loyal friends as they search for the Crystal Skull and it's meaning while being pursued by a solid pack of villains.    The quality of this movie is FAR better than what the rude and 'hating' trolls make this out to be. Indeed, many of the comments concerning the dislike of this movie are ridiculous, despicable, and disgusting all at the same time. Truly an indicator of the infestation of the low class 'simpletons' on the internet. Beware the masses!    Top notch set design, state of the art special effects, and a unique story let \\"Crystal Skull\\" stand on it's own merits apart from the previous films in the series. Not to mention the action and the wonderful perfomances of Ford, Shia, and especially Cate Blanchet whom I thought was gorgeous in the role of Spalko.    The cinematography is a joy to behold that convincingly sets the story in that bygone era of the 1950's. Along with the set desgin and the theme of the film, it truly does harken back to the films from that era as well. John Williams' even touches on some of the weird tones in those '50's  sci fi films thoughout the score.    The movie culminates in an absolutely fantastic climax that far surpasses the 'ho hum' ending to \\"The Last Crusade\\". For me, \\"Crystal Skull\\" ranks better than Indy 3. And bring on Indy 5, but PLEASE, no more religious artifacts.    Enjoy!
B001FBSMW6|5.0|This is Keane's 3rd album.  The first one went to number one.  The second one debuted at the number one spot.  Perfect Symmetry, Kean's 3rd album, debuted at number one in the UK.  I love this album.  It is a total transformation of a band that was luke warm with the first album.  The second was a bit better.  With their front man's (Tom Chaplin) problems during the first two albums, it appeared that it was the end of Keane.  With the problems resolved, Keane has come back sounding very refreshed and ready to kick butt.  They have grown since their first two albums into a very worthy rock band that deserves notice and attention.  Perfect Symmetry is one fantastic album and I would put it up there with Coldplay's X&Y and Viva La Vida.  Keane will be on tour in the UK over the next few months.  If they come to Dublin, I will most assuredly be there to see them.  I highly recommend this album.  If you didn't like either of the first two albums very much or at all, I can assure you that you will most definately NOT be disappointed with Perfect Symmetry.

I resume the message of this movie on those words, perseverance, courage.  The soundtrack is one of the best in my opinion and the camera work is excelent, a must see movie.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKG5/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is surprising!  Beyond the fun and funny, it is well written and acted.  I typically find shows with stereotypes boring and unimaginative.  The geeks in this show are loveable in their geekiness.  They will remind you of someone you know--a friend, son, or even yourself.  Penny is the perfect counter to all the geekiness--a beauty with sass and common sense. To laugh at these characters, is to not take yourself too seriously. Enjoy the dialog, stay for the acting and writing.
B00000J7I3|5.0|Loved this album when I was in high school. Forgot just how much until I was listening again. Really dig this import version with extra tracks- too cool! A must for every Crue fan, and anyone wanting to hear music that epitomized the 80's Sunset Strip Glam Rock genre.
B000VXLC3K|5.0|I've really enjoyed listening to my old album Tapestry.  It brings back fond memories. Elizabeth
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|First of all, i am by the far the biggest fan in the USA if not the world, just trust me :)   Secondly, i got this album this morning on the way to work, already had it other means but i still have to support the greatest rock n roll band EVER, HANDS DOWN!    Anywho, Album.   The stick out tracks to me are:  Rock N Roll Track   Skies on fire-the riffs at the beginning are classic.  War Machine  Smack n Grab  Spoilin for A Fight.  She likes Rock n roll    Although i think all of them are standard, foot tapping AC/DC that ROCK.  I think a couple of songs are suspicious-Anything Goes which to me sounds awful radio friendly with a pop side which to me isnt AC/DC and Rock N Roll Dream is slower. Im sure they will grow on me. I felt some of the songs sounded like a like Fly and Blow up your Video.       Overall-the boys are back and I am impressed- much better than Stiff although i liked stiff, just was slower.   Better drums, catchy riffs and some solid Angus Solos.   Over 9.5/10   Go Get the album, may be their last. If you have children, buy them a copy to show them real rock n roll music. Not this water down garbage that is out there today.   HAIL ANGUS! Hurry up and get to CINCY BOYS!!!
1559409002|4.0|CARNIVAL OF SOULS<br /><br />This is a movie which will definitely make an impact on its viewer.  It is creepy in so many ways that there are few moments in the film that aren't discomforting.  It's also a frighteningly sad tale that touches on the subjects of social isolation, loneliness, disconnect from God, death--it's a big heap of Existential thought really.  It also has one of the most interesting film monsters of all time, this reoccurring ghoul who torments the movies protagonist to the point of a complete breakdown.<br /><br />The movie focuses on a young woman, Mary Henry.  It begins with a drag race that goes badly and the car Mary is riding in goes into a river, killing the other two passengers but leaving Mary alive.  After this accident, she decides to move and find a new beginning as a church organist in Salt Lake City.  All seems well, but Mary soon finds she is being followed by a fiendish looking ghoul.  She never gets more than a quick glimpse of this man, but she is certain he exists and is afraid of him.<br /><br />Coinciding with this apparition of the dead man is the apparition of a living one, her new neighbor, John.  He is a ghoul in a different way, but he is interested in Mary, too.  He's crude, greasy, likes booze for breakfast, and is interested in just one thing from Mary.  Under normal circumstances, she would probably have shunned this looser, but Mary is growing increasingly vulnerable as the ghoul becomes more prevalent and so she turns to John for comfort, surrendering her dignity to him just so she wont be alone.<br /><br />But even this wont be enough to save Mary.  John recoils in disgust from her because of her visions, and Mary finds herself becoming increasingly alienated from normal society.  Not only can she not relate to men, but she commits an unconscious act of blasphemy in a church, has moments when she becomes suddenly invisible, and takes no joy in the lighter things in life.  The only thing that seems to give her comfort is the abandoned carnival near town.  It's inexplicable, but Mary feels drawn to this place, as if voices were calling her.  All the while, the ghoul becomes more frequent and rather than making quick appearances, he lingers for longer periods of time.  Eventually, the single ghoul is joined by others, and it becomes clear that Mary is fighting a force that is greatly outnumbering her, a force she can no longer deny.  She will find her fate at the pavilion, if not the answers to the riddle that has become her life.<br /><br />Perhaps the most effective thing about this movie is that you get to experience it through Mary's eyes.  You get to feel all the oppressive lonesomeness and fear that she feels while being just as confused as to why this is all happening.  The film also makes great use of music.  Throughout the movie we are subjected to this bizarre organ music that comes over the radio or from Mary herself, but it blends so well with the scenes that you don't think about it.  Many of the best parts were also filmed on some great locations.  They are often spacious and bleak landscapes, void of human life.  Between all these elements, there is a continual feeling of disconnect from the world that hits home.<br /><br />It's really somewhat of a tragic movie.  Mary is eventually driven to the brink of insanity, her mind and soul are broken by the strain of her ordeals.  The key to her problems lie with the ghoul, but facing him once and for all will be the hardest think Mary has ever had to do.town.

0375826726|3.0|Overall I enjoyed it. Not once did I have the telltale \\"Get to the point\\" feeling that you sometimes have when reading a long installment. The reason I gave it a 3 out of 5 is because there are a few plot points that seemed a little predictable. This book answered a lot of questions for me, and also gave me more. Also because the ending left a lot to be desired in my opinion, even though I know its only a resting point to be picked up and finished in the last book. You should definately read it so that you can finish it if you've already read the first two books.
0765316897|5.0|Don't let the negative reviews fool you: The Hero of Ages and this entire trilogy is a story for the ages.    Mistborn: The Final Empire enthralled me, seamlessly integrating its magic system into the setting along with perfectly believable characters. On top of that, there was the amazing plot. Taken all together, there was one amazing product. Anyone who has read The Well of Ascension can surmise that there is much more to the original concept--what happened if the Hero of Prophecy failed--than even conceivable.    The first two books left large shadows, but Hero of Ages satisfies. To say that it \\"satisfies\\" is the largest understatement I've ever said. My fears that the trilogy would collapse from a horrible final volume were completely unwarranted. Instead, I was left with a phenomenal book that may just be the best one I've ever read.    In The Hero of Ages, the world is on the edge of destruction, brought about from the force known only as Ruin. Ashfalls grow ever more turbulent, and the mists still kill. Vin and Elend are stymied: how can one save the world from certain doom?    I won't say any more of the plot, but it is a story crafted with a chisel of a master. Things from the first book suddenly become immensely important, and questions from before are answered in a simple, logical fashion. If this story was crafted by anything less than an expert sculptor, a series as complicated as Mistborn--with three different magic systems interacting at the same time--could easily disintegrate into insanity, but this novel never fails to disappoint. Rather than confusion, this book left me in awe of Brandon Sanderson's genius. Every surprise is genuine, yet amazingly logical at the same time.    Anyone who has read Brandon's work will know of his fantastic endings. Well, this book far surpasses my wildest dreams. As the concluding volume in the trilogy, the entire book feels like one gigantic ending, making this novel a ride you won't want to miss. And when you finally do get to the final climax, that product description is not a hyperbole when it says it \\"will leave readers rubbing their eyes in wonder, as if awaking from an amazing dream.\\" I certainly did.    The real heroes of this novel are the wonderfully realized characters. Every character I loved grew (literally), everyone from the emperor Elend, the assassin Vin, the Terrisman Sazed, and even dear Spook grew to become a real character. Each character feels real on every level. Even the tyrannical Lord Ruler--almost an entity of absolute evil in Book One--becomes shockingly deep in this volume to last the ages. This book is a true masterpiece of fiction.
0375826726|4.0|I am so disappointed, to say the least. I have a mother of 2, an elementary teacher, and a lover of all fantasy juvenile fiction.  I just spent the last 2 weeks, every minute free time I had, reading this book.  And the only thing I can say is that I'd like my money back.    Sure, it's an interesting read, and exciting, except it never pays off.  This should not have been a 4 part series.  What was intended to be a trilogy should have remained.  Paolini seemed to have written this book just to make an extra few million by extending the contract.  This offers nothing more to the story, nothing much is solved, no new questions are raised, and there is hardly any action in the book at all.  A thousand pages later, and really a few extra chapers would have sufficed with all the \\"action\\" in this book.  I find myself having to wait until book 4 comes out to have any of the questions of books 1-2 answered.      I can only hope that the authors and publishers don't choose to make it into a 5 part series.  If they do, I'm going to be very angry.  Remember Paolini - less is more!
0312330537|5.0|I have recommended this book to all the devoted readers that I care about.  It is a commitment to read this book, because of the length.  It also helps if you keep a list of character names to refer to so that you don't get confused.  Finally, there are many scenes that are not for the faint of heart. That being said,this is a very powerful book that engaged me in a very foreign environment that revealed poerful truths.  I loved it!
B001G60FSY|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is an entertaining writer. His book The Tipping Point almost made my Top Ten list last year, not only for the thoroughly enjoyable read (which it was), but also for the intriguing analysis into human behavior and consumerism that Gladwell offers.<br /><br />Blink carries on The Tipping Point's tradition of great illustrations and fascinating data. This is a book about \\"the power of thinking without thinking.\\" In summary, Gladwell shows us how our snap judgments are often more accurate than our deliberate decisions that we take months to make. Gladwell peppers the book with examples that prove his thesis, providing church leaders with plenty of stories that beg to be used as sermon illustrations.<br /><br />Gladwell also writes about the \\"dark side of blink,\\" when our snap judgments are wrong. He writes of police mistakes, voter shallowness, and the fact that Coke still outsells Pepsi, even when Pepsi wins hands-down in a taste contest.<br /><br />This book is entertaining, educating, and provocative, and it challenges some of our presuppositions about how the mind works.
1582701709|1.0|Any book that claims that genocide is the fault of the victims (which this book explicitly does) needs to reexamine its premise.  This book actually places the blame of the holocaust on the Jews themselves, rather than on Hitler and the Nazis.  Atrocious.  Among other things, this book is highly offensive to anyone who has suffered unjustly at the hands of another.    This book gives no relevance to the power of actions or the power of the REAL natural laws of the universe.  It also assumes that each person is an autonomous individual with no relationship to others or to the world.      There are so many examples that one could use to refute this book that it would be impossible to name them all.  To name only ONE, humans had no idea that we could emit pollutions to deteriorate the Ozone layer.  Nobody ever THOUGHT that there would be a hole in the Ozone layer before there actually was one.  Our ACTIONS (using harmful pollutants) caused the hole, and our later corrective actions managed to fix the problem.      This is the worst philosophy I've ever heard of.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|When it came out there was a great advertising and promotion campaign. Yet it did not fulfill its promises. One more survival film, you will say. Maybe but I am afraid it is more serious than that. One more epidemic film. Yes for sure, but yet it is deeper than that. One more zombie and living dead film then. Absolutely, but the disappointment comes from farther than that. The film uses three very common forms and it could have intertwined them and twisted them in a new creative way. But with one character and a dog, you do not go that far. In fact it is the whole argument of Stephen King's The Stand. The super flu, the dying of everyone, the survival of a few. But Stephen King remains human and the two antagonistic camps are human survivors and then they represent the two opposite impulses of the human species: to fight and kill to survive against others, and to organize collectively to survive with others. In this film the survivors are good humans and all the others are bad mutants. Badness in man is thus not human but antihuman. That is very naïve indeed, especially when we understand the epidemic was caused by the irresponsible experiments of one doctor on thousands of people with genetically manipulated viruses. It is this vision of good humans attacked from outside by some who are no longer human at all that makes the film poor and even weak. Evil is not outside. Evil is inside. Anyone who says the reverse is just a blind man. Then the plot is no plot because we know what it is going to be. There is no surprise and no psychological death. And the dramatic events here and there are defused by too much disbelief to suspend. How did the woman arrive in Manhattan, how did she escape the house, how did she drive out of Manhattan, how did she know where to go? And many other questions like those. Then the legend becomes a fable and a weak one at that. Too bad because the theme could have been better and the author behind, Matheson, is supposed to be better than that.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesat.

0670020745|3.0|As a neuroanatomist, Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor understands the brain in ways that the majority of people will never understand. Thus, as she experiences a stroke first hand, she is able to give valuable insight to the scientific community as to exactly what took place during that critical time. She writes her thoughts in her book, My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey. Just as valuable, is the fact that she is able to chronicle her steps to recovery, including both the helpful and unhelpful rehabilitation methods. Most importantly, she is able to connect science with emotion in explaining what was occurring in her brain through this difficult journey. In this review, I seek to explain my thoughts and opinions about Dr. Taylor's writing of her experience.    Overall, I feel that this book can offer valuable information to the neuroscience community. It is very rare that a person experiences something like this and knows enough about the brain to be able to correlate clinical symptoms and a scientific explanation. However, I did not agree with the almost spiritual tone Dr. Taylor takes in order to help explain the new way she now lives her life. The book begins by Dr. Taylor explaining about her life before the stroke and then moves into a general overview of the brain and strokes. She identifies various areas of the brain and what they do and also examines the different ways a stroke can occur. The next portion of the book deals with the stoke itself. She details what happened that morning, including what she felt and the thoughts that were going through her mind. She writes about how she was able to call for help and how much thought and effort that took while in the midst of the stroke. What is so interesting is that the entire time this is going on, Dr. Taylor still seems to be able to think clearly and remember what she was thinking. The problem for her was making her thoughts into actions. The rest of the book (and the majority) is spent detailing Dr. Taylor's recovery. She covers everything from basic exercises to help regain function to the more emotional and spiritual side of regaining her life. Interspersed throughout are her thoughts on how best to deal with family, friends, and patients who have suffered from a stroke and are trying to recover. She emphasizes that many of the standard treatment options really do not work and many who care for stroke victims are not properly trained. Dr. Taylor concludes her book by looking back over her experience and reflecting on how much she has learned about herself and how to better help those who have experienced a stroke.    I really enjoyed the beginning of the book. I thought it was interesting to see a glimpse of the Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor before the stroke in order to better contrast her life afterwards. It was easy to read and entertaining. I also thought her introduction to the brain was well written. For those who have some idea about neuroscience, the text may seem somewhat elementary, but it is important to remember that this book was written for the general public, most of whom will have very little knowledge of the basic anatomy and functions of the brain. The way she explained the science behind the brain's functioning made sense and I thought her explanation of the various forms of stroke were easy to understand and a very necessary portion of this book. As I finished the beginning section of this book, I was excited to see how Dr. Taylor's tale would continue to unfold.    The next portion of the book, the part where Dr. Taylor actually experiences the stroke, was the most interesting to me. Having the knowledge that she does, she is able to scientifically think about what she was experiencing as it was going on. This provides a very unique point of view that gives the book its appeal. As she is experiencing the stroke she writes, \\"In that moment I knew. Oh my gosh, I'm having a stroke! I'm having a stroke! And in the next instant, the thought flashed through my mind, Wow, this is so cool!\\" She is alarmed and fascinated at the same time, which is very interesting to see as a reader.    I did not enjoy the next portion of the book, Dr. Taylor's recovery, as much as the earlier portions. The section takes up the majority of the book and I felt it could be shorter. She makes very good points about a firsthand perspective of rehabilitation offered by therapists and how she feels family and friends can play a big role in helping stoke victims regain their former selves. She also delves into the intensely personal side of her recovery, discussing what she was feeling during all of this time. She writes, \\"I was, by anyone's standard, no longer normal. In my own unique way, I had become severely mentally ill. And I must say, there was both freedom and challenge for me in recognizing that our perception of the external world, and our relationship to it, is a product of our neurologic circuitry. For all those years of my life, I really had been a figment of my own imagination!\\" These types of thoughts were somewhat interesting to me, as I feel that her knowledge is valuable in understanding stroke victims around me, but the majority of me felt these types of discussions were hard to read because it was difficult for me to relate to them due to the fact that I do not think in the same way as Dr. Taylor.    My least favorite portion of the book was the end due to the fact that she delves into the spiritual side of her journey. I do not agree with her view and therefore did not particularly enjoy reading this part of her story. She and I have a different opinion on the reason for our existence and why we were put on this earth. Overall, though, I would say this book is a good read for anyone interested in this type of medical nonfiction. Dr. Taylor offers wonderful insight into the workings of the brain and has very valuable advice to offer those who are helping stroke victims recover. This book can be found in bookstores everywhere and I encourage curious readers to pick it up and learn a little bit about how what the brain experiences during and after a stroke.

0060793333|4.0|This is my least favorite of the Narnia stories, and always has been. Either it's because I read this one first, and have read it more times than the others, or it's because I just generally find the others to be more fascinating. Either way, I listened to it as I am going through all the Narnia stories in audio form, for yet another reread of these stories that I have been reading since grade school.    This story is a fantasy take on the resurrection of Christ. The Christ like figure is the lion Aslan, and the son of the creator (emperor) of Narnia. 4 children from England during WWII find their way into this fantasy land by a wardrobe that exists in their uncle's house. The children are humans and Narnia is a land of fairy creatures and talking animals. But the children are here by Aslan, and they are to save his creation.    The voice acting on this story was excellent, one of the best I've heard. The actor must of has 20 different voices for all the characters. So this was a very good production of the story in audio form.
B00009N83U|2.0|In the annals of cinema history, Clint Eastwood is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest American filmmakers.  He has made many great films, and will continue to do so.<br /><br />This is not one of them.<br /><br />This is Clint's worst film, one of his few real duds.  It's a long movie at 121 minutes, but even if Clint had edited it down a bit, it still wouldn't be very good.  I couldn't help but think that Clint didn't really care about this film too much, as he looks bored throughout, and while Bernadette Peters (I think this was the last starring role she had before she went full time on Broadway) tries to spice things up (and has good on screen chemistry with Clint), it's still a very poor film.  There are major plot holes, the biggest of Clint's career.  The tone of the film is rather jarring, switching from light comedy to crude one liners to harrowing gun fights with white supremacists.  Basically, it's just a mess.<br /><br />There are a few (just a few) good things.  It's shot on location in the Sierras, there is a good chase scene at the end, Jim Carrey appears as an Elvis impersonator, and there is some funny situations at the beginning of the film (Clint's first arrest here is very funny).  Clint didn't direct this film, but his production company produced it and Buddy Van Horn directed it.  Van Horn is Clint's stunt coordinator and Clint surrogate, and has directed several Clint films (most notably The Dead Pool).  So it's really Clint's film, and it's his worst.  Most people agree that this film and The Rookie are Clint's worst, but The Rookie is a lot better than this one.  If you are a fan of Clint, and you have to see everything he's done, watch this.  If you aren't, avoid it.
1416562605|2.0|I have no idea why this book has received all this hype.<br />The writing is sub-par and definitely not all that insightful, that the critics say it is.<br />The prose is at the most amateur, an example:<br />\\"With their tinted windows up, the cars of the rich go like dark eggs down the roads of Delhi. Every now and then, an egg will crack open - a woman's hand, dazzling with gold bangles, stretches out of an open window, flings an empty mineral water bottle onto the road - and then the window goes up, and the egg is resealed.\\"<br />And why is the protagonist writing a letter to the Chinese Premier?
B000059PPN|1.0|This is the last Fulci film I ever saw, and it will be the last I'll ever rent.  Fulci had a sort of renaissance in the 1990's, and I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Directors like Quentin Tarantino (who re-released The Beyond to theaters) and Eli Roth have raved about his work.  So I wanted to see the man's work.  I watched a ton of his work, and the only film I really liked was Zombie.  Zombie is a good film, but it pales in comparison to great horror filmmakers' best films, like Romero's vastly superior zombie films, and Dario Argento's masterful period from 1975-1987.  This was the last film of his I saw, and I am angry that I wasted so much time going through this man's catalog.<br /><br />House by the Cemetery is the usual Fulci mishmash.  There's a creepy ending and some good atmosphere, but this film has all the characteristics from the Fulci [...] moviemaking school...bad scenes, bad continuity, bad acting, miserable scripting, complete incoherence, bad dubbing, etc., etc..  Even the gore here isn't as visceral as it is in other Fulci works, like City of the Living Dead and The Beyond.  You do remember the gore in some Fulci films, but it's damn near impossible to wade through the rest of the garbage to get to it.  I am not a gorehound, so I prefer for an entire film to be good, as opposed to having a few decent gore scenes and having to wade through the rest of a crapy film until I get there, which is exactly what you have to do with Fulci's work.  Some say that Dario Argento's work, a far superior filmmaker, doesn't make sense either.  Argento's films are purposely ambiguous, like nightmares, and this was used to the greatest effect in Suspiria (one of the few films that really scares me) and Inferno (his most underrated).  Just because a film is confusing doesn't mean it's art.<br /><br />So if anyone is thinking of diving into Fulci's catalog, stop right now.  Unless you're a gorehound needing a fix, stay away.  Fulci's films are a waste of time (except for Zombie).t for Zombie).
B001GAPC1K|5.0|We have seen this movie three times already. First, we enjoyed it by ourselves; then, with friends and finally with the family.    Robert Downey Jr. plays the lead role of this superhero story. Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.     The movie immediately hooked us for we see Stark visiting the Middle East, delivering weapons and demonstrating the power behind his designs. The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay; use the very weapons he designed for our protection as the tools of mass destruction. How is this possible if he only sells to friends?    Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.    He escapes and comes back home where his assistant, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is waiting for him at the airport. It is fun to watch Stark tell her \\"the vacation is over\\" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger. Burger King must have paid a fortune for this ad.    The technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome. As usual, the bad guys interfere at every turn and he discovers that the force behind his many encounters with challenges is in the identity of which he thought was a close \\"friend.\\"    This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy. We have seen it three times and something tells me we shall soon want to see it again, therefore, we highly recommend purchasing as opposed to going to the movies or renting it. Don't miss it... it is AWESOME!!!
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|AC/DC have finally released new material after eight years of waiting, not to mention the three or so years that they teased us, releasing statements for that long about how new material was being written and recorded. If I were less faithful, I would've said that the new album would become the next Chinese Democracy, having its release date pushed back X amount of times until everyone lost interest. Yet here's the new album, Black Ice, as promised. I must say, it was worth the wait.    The lead single, \\"Rock N Roll Train\\", was released onto radio about a month ago, and it silenced the critics right away (and if they were still saying negative things, you wouldn't be able to hear it over the sheer volume of the track!). All of the classic AC/DC components are here: Ang and Mal's chunky guitar chords, Cliff's driving eighth note bass, Phil's mechanically consistent drums, and of course, Brian's lethal shriek. I was left slack-jawed when I first heard \\"Train\\" on the radio, and thankfully, the rest of the album lives up to the track.    Upon the first listen of the album as a whole, I noticed a shift toward more melodic chord progressions, yet instead of another Stiff Upper Lip, the songs stay heavy; some songs (\\"Anything Goes\\" in particular) sound like the the more melodic side of The Razor's Edge, to give you an idea of what I'm talking about. There are also a fair amount of songs that pay homage to AC/DC's '80-'85 era (\\"Money Made\\"). Over all, fans of AC/DC should not be disappointed with Black Ice, as everything that the band is known and loved for is contained right here; at the same time, those who do not like AC/DC should steer clear of this album as well, despite the amazing rock 'n roll you'd be missing.     One thing I was really looking forward to was hearing extended and ripping guitar solos from Angus á la \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\". Of course, there are solos on Black Ice, but on a lot of songs they seem a bit restrained, and just when I start rocking out, thechorus seems to cut off what Angus was trying to say. Also, the song structures don't seem as varied as previous albums (yes, even by AC/DC's standards). While this is truly not a make-or-break point on this album, it would've been cool to hear some real barn-burners like \\"Landslide\\" off of Flick Of The Switch, or \\"Let There Be Rock\\".    At the same time, the boys actually try new things; there's slide guitar work on \\"Stormy May Day\\", and a calm intro riff on \\"Rock N Roll Dream\\" which contrasts well with the heavy chords of the chorus in the same song.    AC/DC really brought out the rock 'n roll with this album, and the large amount of times the words \\"rock\\" and \\"rock 'n roll\\" appear in the lyrics only reflects this fact. The album clocks in at around 56 minutes, and it seemed like it was finished in half that time, which for me, makes an enjoyable, if not, great album. Black Ice compares favorably to any Brian Johnson-era AC/DC; it is an absolute return to form after the mildly disappointing Stiff Upper Lip. This comes close to the absolute best that I believe AC/DC are capable of producing at this stage in their career, and for these reasons, I rate this 4.5 stars.
B00104W8T6|5.0|This review will not be in the usual format, since this product has been extensively and very well reviewed by prior reviewers.  Rather, I want to alert Amazon customers that the samples for the short songs (< 1 min) are way too short and insufficient to tell what the song is like.    In particular, Up the Spout is so short that it is impossible to find what part of the song the sample came from.    Even on short songs, a 10-sec sample should be enough without \\"giving away the house\\".
0375826726|5.0|Excellent read with a welcomed diversification in voice and character development.  The core progression of the story will appease the eager reader, yet the exploration of sub-character involvement is a fun addition.  Highly recommended - great series for the fantasy lover.
0765316897|4.0|I was a HUGE fan of the Mistborn series. I could hardly wait for the third book and when i finally got it I read it in one sitting. The first part of it actually kinda slow. Not that it lacks action, just as some other reviewer said, character charisma and interaction.     The main problem I had with it was that unlike the other two books which dealt with politics and a little supernatural mistique, Hero of Ages takes it, in my opinion, WAY too far with the whole end of the world scenario. That whole idea of wars between gods and whatnot was SO overpowering and consuming that it left hardly ANY screen time for good old conversations and jokes between the characters. Ham makes 2 maybe 3 jokes in the entire book, and Breeze is even more distant.     Vin and Elend CONTINUE to act as freaking brother and sister with a couple of RARE kisses intermingles here and there at the strangest times.     And FINALLY....SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!    Vin and Elend die! What the hell? After everything they went through to be together, to save the planet, to be able to establish a fair goverment, etc etc...they die. Sure they saved the planet, but they never got to see it. Elend never got to creat his Utopia he strived so hard for. Vin never stopped being a knife, in this case for Preservation and Ruin. It's like even though they saved the planet and EVERYONE ELSE lived happily ever after, the two characters, whom we really want to see succeed, don't get to achieve their dreams and die before they can even see what they helped happen. The two who really deserved a happy ending get nothing.     That was the true downfall of this book. The only character who had any spice at all was Ten Soon. Sazed spent way too much time depressed and mopig around, and Spook got old with his whole Kelsier complex. Ten soon was really a breath of fresh air in the whole mess.     All in all, I give the book a 3.5-4 star rating because although it had many character flaws, it still explained EVERYTHING and demonstrated immense forethought, which just can't be knocked down. The story was also really good, it was just too heavy and dramatic compared to the previous two books. Had Vin and Elend survived or brought back to life it would've lightened it up a whole lot.
B00000260F|3.0|This is the least satisfying release from the catalog of rock's greatest guitarist. But you get a lot of great solos here, and the fantastic version of \\"People Get Ready\\" with Rod Stewart on vocals (it's too bad they didn't do the entire album together). A 3 star Jeff Beck album is still better than a lot of others. He has set the bar so high for himself!
1401907717|5.0|This is a book I read something from everyday. After I sit for a short while in the morning, with my coffee and my kittie, I speak with my angels, briefly, and ask for their message for the day. I then open the book to wherever, and that's my message.      It is extremely uplifting - and amazingly eerie, sometimes - as to how the messages address exactly what is on my mind that morning. This book has smoothed the way in a life that, for recent years, has seen much turmoil. For me, this book is very much a lifeline. And that's why I'm back here today - to order one for a friend who, even though she doesn't know it yet, is going to heal with the help of her angels.
B00006J9OV|5.0|I find that this production is the only one that correctly produces Wagner's intentions as he wanted them.<br /><br />Traditional scenery...lush and noble staging.  The characters act profoundly and there is a great deal of drama and magic all throughout!<br /><br />My favorite Parsifal on DVD!
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is an entertaining historical drama that reminds many of us that the rakish, irresponsible Henry VII actually knew two Boleyn women - the known one - Anne, and the unknown one, Mary.<br /><br />The film tells a story how both sisters end up romancing the king, and how both are used by their father and the Duke of Norfolk to assure their family's status and fortune. Like the later film, \\"The Duchess,\\" the film paints an extremely bleak portrait of a woman's life and choices - something that changed very recently in history.<br /><br />Eric Bana brings life and vitality to Henry, depicting a time before the king had become corpulent and lazy. Natalie Portman is duplicitous and still manages to conjure some sympathy as Anne, and Scarlett Johansson is noble and admirable as Mary.<br /><br />People will aruge over the factual nature of the film, but history should be learned from history research, not from motion pictures. This is a great story and one that can be enjoyed by many.
B000UJCALI|5.0|When asked to summarize 'The Shining' in few words, I always respond with, \\"It's the greatest movie about writers block ever filmed\\".       Stanley Kubrick's film is much more psychological than gory or shocking(although it has its fair share of blood), a fact of which is mostly due to an ambiguous quality propelling both the story and the visuals. The film is even more mysterious than the novel, which itself is fairly clear about the big W's (who, what, where, etc). This is why I find the film version superior to the book, because it leaves more room for interpretation and discussion. It's also possible to misconstrue these ambiguities as plot holes but even the films co-writer, Diane Johnson, states (on the DVD featurette) that she and Mr. Kubrick had to \\"abide by some inconsistencies\\" when dealing with a subject like the supernatural. I think this is a fair explanation considering that the supernatural should be something beyond the reach of human thinking and reason.        I've also had plenty arguments with King fans whom can't get past the major changes between the book and the film. If you ask me, the changes have been for the betterment of the film in it's own medium. Consider the Wendy character - In the book she is strong willed and resourceful but still sticks by her husband even though he's a drunk and loses his job. I argue that the timid Wendy of the film seems much more likely to stand by her unstable husband. The image of her with the bat backing away from Jack would be much less powerful had it been a more 'forceful' woman (i.e. character) in the role.       Not to mention the acting and the music. You would think that watching three actors rotting in an old hotel for three hours would be boring but it's quite the opposite. Jack Nicholson is wild here, you can tell from the instant you see him, there's something going on in him that's not quite right. And Shelley Duvall is perfect as the shy and loving wife who feels scorned by her husband and confused by her child. The music, a strange mix of synthesizers and classical compositions, sets the feel instantly, creating a dread and suspense uncommon in most other horror schlock.      It would be fair to say that 'The Shining' is, if not the best, one of the greatest gothic horror films ever produced. Highly recommended.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is simply put... My favorite movie... period.  Acting... screenplay adaptation..costumes...soundtrack.    I found little fault with it..  Except wanting to be the leading lady...  Why are there no movies like this anymore?  The soundtrack is haunting.. and I finally found a website that I was able to download with little or no background noise.  Get the movie... you truly will not be disappointed.
B0011HOEY4|1.0|I was told American Gangster was an epic gangster movie in the tradition of the Godfather. Nothing of the kind. Instead it is another cliched and mediocre urban gangsta flick.
B001FBSMW6|2.0|Keane has been one of the few bands of late which I felt cared so much more about their art than critical success.  Well, that's all changed now.  I loved Hopes and Fears b/c it was so different and emotionally charged.  I thought it would be hard to top that album, but Under the Iron Sea was that much better, with the dark, stark moodiness and experimental, more rockish tunes.  I liked the first two albums that I figured this third album was going to be awesome and bought it the day it came out.  I was so wrong to do that.     The first half of this album just plain sucks.  It sounds like a throwback to the worst 80's technopop garbage, like a lame homage to Erasure, but more toward Simple Minds, with a lot of \\"Whooooo\\" sounds and really awful programmed-sounding squiggly Yaz-type effects (and I actually like Yaz and Erasure a lot).  The completely went the U2 \\"Pop\\" route, trading moody, thoughtful and brilliant music/lyrics for throwaway gimmicks.  It's just bad, bad, bad.    The second half of the album is somewhat redeeming, with some \\"old\\" Keane showing up, but most it just sounds like recycled tunes from the first two albums.  There's nothing new AND good here.      I would have been disappointed had I paid the $2.99 deal for mp3 tracks of the whole album, but even getting the actual CD for $9.99 seems like a ripoff.  I'll still probably go see them live in the hopes that they'll play a lot of old stuff, but I will take a good listen before I risk my $ on the next album.  On the plus side, much of this album is so light-hearted and inoffensive that it might make a good laxative.
B000YD7S2Q|5.0|This is perhaps the most mysterious and magical production of Lohengrin on DVD.<br /><br />It is aptly interpreted, there are some great visual effects throughout using smoke, lighting and scenery.  It is still a traditional rendering, but with a little more emphasis on the mysterious qualities of the drama.<br /><br />A real feast for the eyes!
0143039830|5.0|What can I say? There is nothing quite like this trilogy out there in the world of modern literature. Auster hit his stride with these three novellas, which stand as a kind of examination of language and existentialism masked by a cloak of private eye genre fiction.       If I had to rate the stories individually, I would say 'The Locked Room' is the weakest. Not that it is bad or worse than the others, it just seemed to serve more as an autobiography of the author, so after finishing the first two this one seemed a little less daring. The other two, 'City of Glass' and  'Ghosts', are equal in my view. A great price and edition for three innovative and intriguing stories.

B000A158TM|3.0|Although I love this movie and was very excited to see this available on UMD, I'm a little disappointed in the UMD version.  I wouldn't pay more then $10 for the UMD version of this.  Its basically just the movie and the quality isn't that great.  Looks like someone copied the VHS version onto the UMD and didn't even bother to widescreen or up the resolution.  You'd have been better buying the dvd, then ripping it.  No extras either.
B00004BZ16|1.0|This album is an exercise in self-indulgence from start to finish. Spilled across three lps/2cds is a collection of songs and fragments that fall into three categories: reggae-based music that likely could have been an expectable single-disc album; rock-based material of mediocre quality and several song fragments, instrumentals and aural pastiches the appearance of which only go to prove that no one was thinking of quality when Sandinista was being produced. An album of this size (36 tracks; not all of which I consider songs) is a tough row to hoe for any band. One of the most successful multi-disc albums was Dylan's `Blonde on Blonde.' It was but two discs with an 11 odd minute opus talking most of one side of the four. The White Album, another two disc effort, is still the subject of debate and conjecture, marking as it does the early signs of group fragmentation. I have to feel that most folks will agree that The Clash were not in the same league with Dylan and The Beatles. The level of arrogance and pretension in their making a three disc product can only be seen as the aural equivalent of Michael Cimino's `Heaven's Gate.\\"<br /><br />For the band claiming the moniker \\"The only band that matters,\\" one has to wonder more about the question of \\"what matters to them? It is not, however, the musical styles with which I have issue. Except maybe the third grouping which I felt were, at best, the sort of cuts one expects to find as additional tracks on a reissued classic album.<br /><br />Instead, it is the imagery of this band that troubles me because I have no faith in it being anything more than style over substance. Wearing their fashionable political views on their fashionable clothing, these poseurs always seemed to be at ease talking the talk but never walking the walk. Always image conscious and eager to please as many as possible, The Clash apparently decided to take the approach of throwing everything they had against a wall and hoping much of it would stick; that is to say have all of the material accepted by some part of their audience. This approach is a betrayal, no; it is dishonesty IF you feel The Clash had any modicum of belief in what they were doing beyond revenue generation.<br /><br />And while I understand that Barrett Strong hit the nail on the head with `Money,' I still expect folks to live by the words they use. Look at Bono or Jon Bon Jovi to see how a rock star can hold political views and live by them as well. Perhaps the only complementary thing I can saying about this work is that perhaps it was a rite of passage needed to reach `Combat Rock.'ay have all of the material accepted by some part of their audience.

0385512104|4.0|I actually enjoyed this book. The story is funny, yet sad, realistic, yet fictional. It may seem hard to read because of the digressions, but they are typically short. I read the poor reviews and I think those people are emotionally unstable and uneducated about the Autism Spectrum. Quite frankly the author nailed a 15 year old boy with \\"behavioural problems\\". I have read \\"Look me in the eye\\" written by a man with Aspergers and it is actually quite similar in nature.    If you have ever watched \\"Autism the Musical\\" and viewed the children with Aspergers you'd see Steve Stills' son and how he behaves, very similar to how the boy in the book writes. The boy is obsessed with math and physics, just as Steve Stills' son is obsessed with dinosaurs (as is my son who has high functioning Autism), they can stay on a plot line for a little while but then tend to digress into something familiar or comforting when they are upset. You can totally read this in the book.    I say bravo. and for all of your information Autism is not a disease!
B000W4KT64|1.0|Okay, I'm prefacing this review with the fact that I watched very little of this 2007 version of this film. I am a John Waters fan, and enjoyed his amusing original film which starred some of my favorite performers, like Debbie Harry and Water's originals like Mink Stole. Very recently, I was dragged kicking and screaming to front row center seats purchased by a good friend for the national tour of \\"Hairspray\\" ( I am generally not a fan of musicals..though I like the classics (Gypsy, West Side Story..) and did enjoy \\"Wicked.\\" ) Well..I quickly changed  my tune, and was myself amazed at the constant grin I had on my face during the show from beginnng to end. The musical numbers were not only show stoppingly great, but the entire cast was absolutely amazing, with the stand out being the actor who played Mother Edna Turnblad.  Though I had heard Harvey Fierstein did a magnificent job on the Broadway show, I did not see that. In this  live version I have just seen,  the only other person I was familiar with who I could have imagined doing as good a job would have been glorious Divine. He/she was very comical, charmingly slovenly, and overall brilliant, and really brought forth the spirit of Divine, without in any way trying to \\"copy\\" her, and the audience reaction upon curtain call showed they were apparently in avid agreement with me. My PROBLEM with this film version is the casting of JOHN TRAVOLTA!  All too often, original good parts are ruined when the greedy powers that be decide that they will make more quick filthy lucre if they cast a *STAR* name, usually with disasterous artistic results. This film is a perfect example. I admit that the last Travolta vehicle that I  liked was \\"Sat. Night Fever\\"..as I was a N.Y. disco duck at the time and it was a sensation . Since then, I would describe him as a real \\"jambon\\",  as Truman Capote might have...and other than maybe \\"Pulp Fiction\\" which I have never seen, I defy anyone to name a Travolta film that could remotely be termed a classic, or, even a good film, for that matter. Like his contemporary and fellow self important  Scientologist and nut job, Tom Cruise, I do not find them good actors, they are more \\"actory\\" than \\"actor\\", and I would rather watch 100 nameless, far more talented unknowns than watch either of  them emote. Okay, I guess I have made my distaste for Travolta's screen presence clear. He ruined \\"Hairspray\\" for me. He's just a big, ugly, fat suited actor who looks completely fake compared to the other actors, even in their time relevant garb..and observing not only his hideous presence but his LOUSY, talentless, unintelligible performance for admittedly only a few laborious minutes made me realize that they might as well have had Big Bird or Barney The Dinosaur cast in this role. I can imagine during production that all present were aware that there was a BIG turkey on the set, and it's name was Travolta....but by then they probably felt it was too late.  He even looks completely out of place on the darn dvd cover! (LOOK NOW!! ) Let's face it, most of the films made today are cr*p, and this one can be added to the pile. It is a shame, because people like Queen Latifah were probably very good in their roles in this film, but Tra-revolta's  presence made it unwatchable for me. I would be curious to know what John Water's honestly felt about this portrayal, though I imagine that maybe his finally making some well deserved big bucks may compensate for having one of his most famous creations ruined. If Harvey Fierstein,  or indeed even the wonderful actor presently playing Edna in the national tour were to have played the film role, it would have been as good and entertaining as the Broadway show.  Instead, it is a minor musical and a major joke, at least to me, and that opinion is based on the PUTRID miscasting of Travolta, whose portrayal is completely devoid of any of the charm, camp, and comedy of that great lovable character, \\"Edna Turnblad.\\"  Let's rename Travolta's portrayal \\"Edna  BAD-TURN.\\" Yuck.'s portrayal \\"Edna  BAD-TURN.\\" Yuck.

B000HEWEDK|2.0|Let's be honest here......had it not been for the jaw-dropping special effects (at least for the time), this mundane flick would have been quickly forgotten. As another reviewer pointed out, most of the money for the production seems to have gone for the effects, with only a token amount devoted for the cast and soundtrack. Robby the robot alone cost some $100,000 to create...not a small sum for the mid-1950's. I like Leslie Nielsen, but he was just getting started here. A bit green and it shows. Walter Pidgeon, an otherwise fine and gifted actor, was far past his prime by the time he did 'Forbidden Planet'. Leggy Anne Francis comes off more as dingy blonde prick tease than anything. And I can only assume that a booze-guzzling Earl Holliman was inserted as comic relief.<br /><br />The politically correct crowd will find a lot to gripe about with this film. There wasn't a single African-American in the entire cast. And apparently, females had not yet been trusted to operate, much less travel in, interstellar spacecraft, since Nielsen's crew is entirely male. And even they begin acting like immature teenage boys as soon as they get an eyeful of Anne Francis. As the only female character, she didn't do much to advance the feminist cause. This sort of thing could be found in any number of films from the 1950's. 'Forbidden Planet' most certainly was not the only one.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about this film is the soundtrack. OMG...what were they thinking? An overheated theremin (along with some creative use of reverb and echo) pushes out a near-constant stream of bleeps, warbles, shrieks and other noises that don't sound anything like music. Imagine a pair of white-hot sewing needles being inserted into your eardrums. This film would have been so much better served by a soaring, orchestra-based soundtrack.<br /><br />All in all, this is NOT a bad film, but it has some bad qualities. Worth watching at least once, if for no other reason because it's a classic. But not worth the tons of praise I've seen heaped on it over the years.praise I've seen heaped on it over the years.
B001AZIRZY|5.0|I am probably the only person in the United States that found this DVD hilarious.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend and three cats didn't last the first disc.    For the Nay-sayers:  1.  This is a cartoon.  It is meant to be goofy and not taken seriously.  2.  When was the last time you turned to PBS to watch cartoons and comedy?  British humor (oxymoron) doesn't count.  3.  One can compare the artwork of this DVD to \\"The Lion King:  The Musical\\".  As one reviewer wrote about the musical, the story and music are great once you get past the costumes.  4.  Get real expectations.  When listening to \\"CarTalk\\", the fun is trying to guess the caller's auto/relationship problem.  The humor is secondary.  With cartoons, the intellectually part of your brain is not required.  How much intelligence is needed to watch \\"The Flintstones\\", \\"The Little Mermaid\\", or \\"The Simpsons\\"?  5.  Story lines are simple.  Doh!  Cartoons are designed to numb the brain from reality of life.    For others looking for positives:  1.  You have to WATCH each episode.  There is background humor that takes place in the artwork.  For example:  one of the books is titled:  \\"Fundraising:  From B.C. to Barack\\".  Some of the humor follows the approach used in \\"Police Squad in Color\\".  Too many people use television as background noise as opposed to actual entertainment.  2.  If you love the wise-cracks from \\"CarTalk\\", you will love each episode.  The humor is steadily paced.  These guys grew up in the era of Abbott and Costello.  The humor of this time period took a little time to set-up and is not rapid fire.  Current humor is designed for the ADHD viewer:  How many jokes can one insert into a sentence.   Sit back, take your Ritalin or Focusyn tablet, and enjoy the show.  If you want rapid-fire comedy, see CarrotTop.  3.  I bought a used copy.  One cannot say anything negative when paying $1.74 + shipping.    I like the show and am anxiously awaiting the debut of Season Two.  It might be a long wait.  I willbe patient.  : )

B001CC7PP8|5.0|Love this film--and have for 35 years since I first saw it.  No commentary from me would add to that which has been already written about it.    One of the extras was about Hitchcock's legacy.  Two of the directors discussing their influence by Hitchcock were the directors of recent films \\"Smokin' Aces\\" and \\"Hostel.\\"    To me these films are abominations and against everything that Hitchcock stood for.  Any influence is superficial at best as these recent films are the main staple of an audience who wants mindless, gory action.    For these mindless directors to appear in this documentary homage to Hitchcock who would have found these films horrible movie-making was an insult to those of us who crave something more from our movies--and aren't finding it anymore!!!!!!!

Without Mason, Waters, and Wright, David Gilmour isn't creating the magic that was PF, but it's still great material. Whether you're a fan of the voice or the guitar, or a new fan looking to try something out, this is a decent buy. The songs are all easy to listen to, and it's just a simple formula that works.
B00005JPO1|2.0|I think the cards were stacked against Steven Speilberg. He had no choice but to direct this film because Harrison Ford thought it would be a good idea to have a fourth Indiana Jones flick.

B001DU8T6S|5.0|First off all. Those expecting to hear Freddie should leave now. This is a new group with plenty of nods to Queen & Paul Rodgers past careers. I think many people had unrealistic expectations. It's not another A Night The Opera, but it is a mighty fine rock album!!    Cosmos Rockin' kicks the album off in true rock n' roll fashion. This is a great lively track that clearly shows that Brian, Roger & Paul had a huge amount of fun recording this album.    Time to Shine is really unlike anything that they have recorded before. This has hints of a U2 sound at parts and is one of the standout tracks on the album.    Still Burnin' is probably one of the weakest tracks on the album, but is rescued by a great solo from Brian.    Small is the outstanding track of the album. A simple acoustic number that builds to a beautiful chorus and great solo from Brian.    Warboys started life as a Paul Rodgers solo track and here is given the full on rock treatment. A great military time drumbeat makes this one of the highlights of the album.    We Believe is probably the weakest track on the album for me, simply because the lyrics are a little to cheesy for me. This is probably the most \\"Queen\\" sounding track on the album.    Call Me, is a simple light weight number that is incredibly catchy. The guitar solo from Brian would not sound out of place on A Night At The Opera.    Voodoo is a totally departure for Brian and Roger, but it works. One of the standout tracks on the album. Very bluesy, great stuff.    Some Things That Glitter is one of the best tracks that Brian has written in over 20 years. The highlight of the album. The guitar playing on this one sounds like it came from a Queen album from the 70s.    C-lebrity is the lead single and is a comment on the celebrity culture in which we live. A powerful guitar riff and catchy chorus makes this an obvious choice for the 1st single.    Through The Night sounds like a Bad Company track, which is not a bad thing. This is after all a Queen + Paul Rodgers album.    Say It's Not True was originally written for Nelson Mandella's 46664 campaign and is reworked here. Featuring lead vocals from Brian, Roger & Paul the track builds from an acoustic number to a power ballad in the classic Queen style.    Surf's Up . . . School's Out! is a Roger track. VERY Roger. A pounding rhythm reminds me of Headlong. This is a very fun track!    Small reprise is a beautiful end to the album. Lovely guitar work from Brian.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Sadly I didn't watch the show when it was on HBO (my husband & daughters did).  But after my husband passed away in 12/04 (he was only 52) I had alot of late nights that I couldn't sleep so I started watching SATC in syndacation & fell in LOVE with the series! I know watch it 5 times every night.  This year in anticipation of the movie my daughters bought me the complete series on dvd & we watched the ENTIRE series before we saw the movie on opening day.  So of course I had the movie to complete my set.  I mch more enjoyed watching it in the comport of my living room then in the straightbacked chairs at our local theatre.  Now looking forward to \\"The Carrie Daries\\" to fill in those long blanks.
0385340990|5.0|Definitely joining my list of favorite books!  Loved the characters, the historical fiction, and the perfect mix of horrible atrocities with warmth and love.  I am recommending this book to everyone I know.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|David Tennant Is Brilliant! The WHOLE show has me watching certain episodes more than 5 times! I've been a fan since the 70's when it got grat each time. Now, with all the special effects, bringing back Sarah Jane, K9!, and current chacters is just brilliant! Espicially in the last episode of this dvd, just OUTSTANDING!! I wish I could meet Russell T Davies and tell him what a great job he is doing! I wish I could be on the show! I love outer space, and these special effects are just fantastic, keep up this fantastic work!! I never thought I'd be this much into Dr. Who again since Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davidson and all the rest.....Mike
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|I bought this expecting entertainment, and it delivered it 100%.  I don't think it was pretending to be anything else.  I gave 5 stars for being better than the reviews here suggested, and it is a film I would watch several times over - just good light-hearted entertainment.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Wow, sometimes i wonder if theres a secret government conspiracy to give this movie a bad review on Amazon lol. Becouse you know something is up when such a good movie gets such sketchy reviews....its either some people are on crack, or totally dont know how to have a good time at the movies.<br /><br />Did you even watch this film? Please, lay off the heroin, marijuana, crack, meth or whatever mind alter substance youre on. Please. lol<br /><br />This movie is a riot. Plain and simple. Its classic Indiana Jones....with signature touches from both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, they prove to still be a wonderful team.<br /><br />Theres so much over the top action and adventure that goes on in this film, all i can say that it is great fun. Anyone who loves classic adventure will enjoy this well done addition to the Indian Joins trilogy.<br /><br />At first, i wasnt sure if Harrison Ford could do it, i thought maybe he lost that spark of excitment, humor and charm....but as the movie rolled onward, it just kept warming up and Ford proved that Dr. Jones is back.<br /><br />I think this film was a lot more fun than the previous films that were very dark in ways, but with Crystal Skull, again, is much more fun. Definitely better than Temple Of Doom, in my opinion, and nowhere as dull as Raiders, though thats classic fun.<br /><br />I cant believe that im actually saying this, but i think i might like this installment the most out of the entire series of Indian Jones films.<br />I recommend you watch this on Blu Ray on a big High Def screen with a great sound system. It will keep you watching from start to finish.<br /><br />And trust me, even if you have cheesy setup, you'll have good time, becouse to be honest with you, i watched this film, in its entirety, on a website, and the video quality was very low and the sound was MONO...not even stereo sound.<br /><br />I felt like i was watching a classic adventure movie. The way it was directed, just had a classic style. The acting was good. I loved the beginning....for people that are familiar with George Lucas, or is a fan of his, you'll notice his contributions in this film. And of course, Spielberg has that visionary scope that is so big and memorable, it reminded me of the wonder i found in films like the Goonies and E.T.<br /><br />Lots of scenes in this film are just classic. I cant stop saying how much fun i had watching this film. This is one of those movies where you get all your food, candy, soda and whatever else ready, along with your family, and you just have fun old time. I cant wait to see this again in Higher Definition and on a bigger screen.<br /><br />Shia Lebouf ...if thats how you spell that boys name...does a good job in his role, and i can see him in future Jones movie projects, and even the girl from the original Jones film, the brunette, shes back...its so good to see an original character like that return to the series, and shes funny and full of life in this one.<br /><br />Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull has more fun than any of the past films because it doesnt take it self extremely seriously, it lightens up where it needed to lighten up , but dont you dare think this movie is soft or something, like its for the Disney channel. No way.<br /><br />That trademark graphic grotesque realism is still present in the series....two words....KILLER ANTS. Just look out for that scene! Among others.<br /><br />Now let me mention the music that accompanies us through our adventure....John Williams, the original creator the series original film score , is back and gives the film more of that classic film score, its great, and is a strong addition to the film and makes it even more lovable. I swear, if you need a guy to make a rip roaring adventurous film score that you'll never forget, count on John Williams to get the job done...other films he did the music for are such historical and timeless tunes as that for Star Wars and Superman, not to mention his great work on Shindlers List.<br /> Anyways, the music is great and worth sticking around to listen to even as the credits start to roll up the screen. Its that good.<br /><br />Out of all the Indian Jones film, this also must have the most insane action of them all. Sure, past Indy films had their share of off the wall, \\"see it to believe it\\" action and special effects, but Crystal Skull takes all to a level never reached in the other films....the events that go on in this movie just leave you saying \\"...Wow\\"<br /><br />This is classic adventure, thanks to George and Steven, who prove they can make a fun film practically the whole family will enjoy...even if there are some freaky moments. LOL<br /><br />I recommend this film to everyone who loved the old Jones movies and love fun adventure films. To everyone else, i suggest you lay off the illegal substances!<br /><br />Theres good classic Jones humor, and great special effects, likable characters, fantastic music, and the story takes us to where no Jones has gone before....come on people....what did you expect from STEVEN SPIELBERG and GEORGE LUCAS?????<br /><br />Some predictable tale about finding another biblical artifact involving the Nazi party ? Thats all been done before....this time, its even more mind blowing. Its naturally where Dr.Jones adventures would of led him next.<br /><br />I cant wait to see what they pull of for Indian Jones 5!isten to even as the credits start to roll up the screen.

B001F7MSFM|5.0|Outside of Ron Perlman's bravo performance as the title character, Hellboy, in the first film, what wowed me the most (as I stated in my previous Amazon review) was the deeply theological and emotional subtexts of that film. As much as I loved Ron Perlman's even more bravo performance in \\"The Golden Army\\", it took me a while to clue into the fact that some of the deepest subtexts in this second movie are a bit different than the first film.     I don't wish to indulge in any real spoilers this early in the game, but this new film has exchanged the theological subtext for a psychological one that is just as deep.     In the first film, the question was one of what made Hellboy a truly 'human' character. The answer was the right to choice based on free will. In this new film, the related question is whether or not Hellboy can ever truly fit in and should he even try. \\"The Golden Army\\", with the beneficial switch to Universal Pictures, makes a clever connection between Hellboy and Boris Karloff in \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\". Mr. Karloff's little cameo appearance as Frankenstein on one of Hellboy's many television sets in a significant scene with Elsa Lanchester as the titular Bride nails that subtext in just a few brief moments of film time in a way that a lot of surface action in the film never could have.     The father/son subtext of the first film is still here, but buried even more deeply as John Hurt's character of Hellboy's adoptive father, Trevor Bruttenholm, was murdered in the first film. We are reminded of his character by a cameo appearance of John Hurt as Trevor 'Broom' in a flashback to Hellboy's younger years; but hasn't anyone ever told Guillermo del Toro that, in the original comics, an eleven-year-old Hellboy would nowhere be as small as the character is portrayed in this flashback. In the original comics, once he get past ten years old, Hellboy is almost full grown physically, if not emotionally mature.     Yet, there is a further connection in the newfilm to that father/son subtext of the original film. It's too bad that it is one that will probably pass right over the heads of that portion of the audience who haven't see the first movie. In this second movie, both Hellboy and Prince Nuada are the sons of murdered fathers. Where the huge difference lies between these two characters is the identity of the villain who commited the murder.     Once again, we have a film of deep emotional, religious subtexts lurking under a fun, exciting, quip filled surface. Watch out for a drunken scene between Abe and Hellboy. I thought I'd die laughing; but it is those deeper subtexts that make me love Guillermo del Toro's \\"Hellboy\\" movies and I can't wait for the third installment.
B00005JPS8|5.0|It was every thing I hoped it would be. Downey is the Man! Who knew this would come from the guy that made \\"MADE\\"? Neat trick. I'm waiting for the next one. Losing Howard is depressing, I like the other guy but I think those that start, should stay, I hate cast changes in midstream. Don't you? Still an entertaining movie a definite must see.
B001GKJ2F2|1.0|Another great comic made bland by Hollywood. Thanks for taking a great idea and pissing on it. Don't worry it has splosions and f-ects for those who can't read the comic...
B0013D8LCW|2.0|I respectfully disagree with most of the other people who have commented about how great this movie is.  My personal opinion is that the bar for gay cinema has been so lowered that this passes for greatness; it really doesn't.    It's true that the film doesn't indulge in gay stereotypes:  that is, there's no campy/effete/flamboyant character to epitomize what it \\"is\\" to be a gay man.  The gay men in this film drink beer, and they surf.    But all the other stereotypes are there in spades.  Zach's best friend, another surfer dude, who laments \\"Oh, why wouldn't you come out to me?  I'm your best friend!\\"  (Listen to how he refers to his gay brother and decide whether you want to be defined by your sexuality like that from then on.)  Zach's sister, who naturally doesn't want to raise her child around some \\"fag,\\" but who changes her mind after one impassioned speech.  And Zach's ex-girlfriend, remarkably tolerant of the fact that the guy she last slept with has moved on to sleep with guys.    Zach himself is not a gay stereotype; instead, he is an \\"indie movie\\" stereotype.  The troubled kid with a heart of gold who loves his family and his nephew sooooo much that he refuses to ever call his sister (mother of the nephew) out on how poorly she's raising the kid.  In almost every scene she's in, Zach's sister is busing imposing upon him to take care of Zach while she goes off galavanting with her new boyfriend who, oddly, doesn't like her kid.  The exceptions are one scene when she's loudly making out with the new boyfriend while her son is asleep, and when she's imposing on Zach to take the kid for six months to a year while she moves to another city with the boyfriend.  (For some reason, the ENTIRE CITY PROHIBITS THE INTRODUCTION OF CHILDREN INTO ITS BORDERS.)  Zach never once complains, but instead sucks it all up, giving up portions of his social life and definitely giving up his dream of going to art school on a full scholarship.    Indie movie film vibe, I get it.But this movie isn't as great as everyone makes it out to be.

B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is astounding.  The music is complex, experimental, ornate, passionate, and at times very strange.  There are no filler tracks here; instead you find 11 thought-provoking, powerful pieces of art.  The actual artwork is the same quality as the music, especially when viewed through the stereoscopic glasses.  In short, Tool shatters and incinerates the status quo with this tribute to singer Maynard James Keenan's mother.
B00158UUA6|5.0|I upgraded from the standard DVD to Blu-ray to get the full effect of this concert.  The detail is amazing and the lighting seems even more beautiful than I remember.  What an outstanding concert with lots of wonderful guests!  I loved the country location at dusk as the sun goes down over the Tuscan hills to reveal a spectacular evening sky.       The sound quality is awesome for this gorgeous collection of music.  I don't understand why the Blu-ray version is still so hard to get.  Really happy I got mine when I did!
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|This movie was great! The plot and the characters were perfect. It also has a funny side to it, so for all of you who like action with a little bit of comedy this is perfect for you.

0765316897|5.0|This is good...Oh, this is REAL good! The Hero of Ages proves to be the perfect ending to one of the greatest fantasy series I have read. That's not to say that we get a fairy-tale ending; no... Characters die in this book, and some pretty fantastic problems arise.<br /><br />The book picks up roughly one year after the end of the second book. The mists have been staying out even in the daytime, and the ash mounts are emitting more and more ash. The people are being starved to death...or killed by the mists.<br /><br />Vin and Elend have journeyed from Luthadel, to other cities in the Final Empire, in attempt to find secret storage caches left behind by The Lord Ruler. Each cache gives them vital clues to defeating the force Vin released at the Well of Ascension; Ruin. As the story progresses, we find that there is more going on in Vin's world than she knows about, such as an unseen force who has the power to hear spoken words and read, or change, written text.<br /><br />In this book, the puzzle pieces are revealed (though, at a painstakingly slow pace that makes you want to skip ahead and read the last page!), and we come to see just how well thought-out the books were. Brandon Sanderson is one clever being.<br /><br />The completely unique magic system, the reality of leadership, the plotting, suspense, authentic human reactions, etc... I cannot fathom how he managed to come up with it all.<br /><br />If you haven't read the first two books, I urge you to try them. Brandon Sanderson's thoroughness, and quality of writing will speak for itself.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|This movie was slow, boring, and full of nonsense characters. I don't understand how people could praise a movie devoid of story, plot, and characters who make any sort of sense.  I watched it twice just to see if I missed something, but no it really was as bad as I thought it was.  The lead character did things that contradicted actions earlier on in the film. I haven't read Oil! but if the writing is as bad as the movie, i'm shocked it was ever published. All the film people who suckered me into getting this movie can stick it, and no its not that I don't \\"get it.\\" The cinematography may have been good but if I wanted something to look at I would go to an art museum. When I watch a movie I want story and hopefully some good characters to act the story out. I guess movies are just like the art world where once you make something good you can put anything on the screen and be praised. I usually like Paul Thomas Anderson, But unlike Boogie Nights and Magnolia this film is an oily turd.
B000W91RUG|4.0|If you don't mind a pause for line delivery, this is the best sitcom out for people who read about math theory. If Friends seemed like it could be funny but the characters just didn't seem normal, you should check into Big Bang. If you understand most of REMs lyrics, you might want to pick this up. If you are tired of reading Dilbert and still have Far Side clippings stuck to your monitor, give this show a shot. If you have a family member that talks to you about World of Warcraft like you know what they are talking about but really have no idea, you'll see that the characters are the same as your loved one.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|After leaving the theater in 2005 nearly wiping tears from my eyes after watching the genius of Batman Begins, I said \\"part of me wishes they would never make another film because there's no way they could come close to the perfection of this movie\\".<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For the past 2 years I have been awaiting The Dark Knight with more excitement than any other movie in my life. Searching the net daily for new information, watching the trailers around 500 times (no exaggeration) and following the genius viral marketing plan online, I knew that The Dark Knight would be an amazing effort and my expectations were through the roof. I expected a nearly perfect movie and my expectations were EXCEEDED.<br /><br />To avoid spoiling this work of genius, a short recap is all I will provide. After the events of Batman Begins the city is in chaos and a new threat emerges in the form of the psychotic Joker. Wanting to inflict anarchy and disorder, the Joker has no real ulterior motives other than to cause trouble and misery for the residents of Gotham. With the help of Lt. Gordon and newly elected DA Harvey Dent, the Batman faces his toughest nemesis ever as he tries to saved his beloved city so he can one day take off his mask for good and Bruce Wayne can be with his true love Rachel.<br /><br />Cast/Production Opinions<br />------------------------<br /><br />GENIUS<br /><br />Heath Ledger - Ledger's performance as The Joker quite simply is THE definitive take on the clown prince of crazy and a genius display of acting. All the hype that has been directed at Ledger is not without merit. Not only does Ledger give the greatest villain performance I have ever seen, he LIVES The Joker. The little nuances, walks, grunts, etc. is absolute CANDY for the viewing audience. If you have wanted a menacing Joker that cares about nothing and just wants to cause mayhem, this Joker will become THE Joker forever. So much more than just a character, Ledger gives one of the great performances in film history.<br /><br />PERFECTION<br /><br />Gary Oldman - The 2nd best performance in the TDK and another amazing performance as Lt. James Gordon. For anyone that is a fan of Batman Year One and the comics, you will appreciate Oldmans work nearly as much as Ledger. Quiet, subdued, and wonderful, you CARE for Lt. Gordon and you are happy when things go his way. This is an amazing work and can't be ignored.<br /><br />Location - Chicago really was a perfect place to film these movies. The city looks amazing and you really feel like you are in Gotham.<br /><br />NEAR PERFECTION<br /><br />Christian Bale - Fantastic Bruce Wayne, perfect as Batman, obv the movies don't work if he doesn't. On par with the greatness of his work in Batman Begins. I don't think it's better work here, I think in both movies he is amazing equally.<br /><br />Michael Caine - Wonderful as Alfred as per usual.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan - Another wonderful job directing. The IMAX shots really add to the film and the opening shots in IMAX make you go WOW. Is Nolan capable of making a bad movie?<br /><br />Writing - Great script which is very dense. This might not be for everyone but having a dense story done right only adds to the longevity of the film over time.<br /><br />Gadgets - The new Batpod and other cool stuff are still realistic and not over the top. Any technology that is introduced in the movie serves a good purpose and makes sense.<br /><br />GREAT<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart - Great performance that makes you CARE about Harvey Dent and what he is trying to do for the city of Gotham. At the end of the movie when he's not the same person that he was at the beginning he still gives a great performance<br /><br />Morgan Freeman - Such a great actor and he builds on his character from Batman Begins, very solid<br /><br />GOOD<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal - This is one of the only weak parts of the movie. I never criticized Katie Holmes in Batman Begins because I thoughtshe did a fine job acting and her baby faced innocence I thought was a good match for Bruce Wayne. I just thought she was too young. I think Gyllenhaal was in a tough spot with this role. She comes into TDK with a character already created and she doesn't seem sure how to act accordingly. Does she be Dawes as Katie Holmes or a new version? I think she's good in the movie but I would have rather had Holmes return. She could have done so much more but I felt she was lazy in this role.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is THE definitive \\"super hero\\" movie but it is so much more.

She comes into TDK with a character already created and she doesn't seem sure how to act accordingly. Does she be Dawes as Katie Holmes or a new version? I think she's good in the movie but I would have rather had Holmes return. She could have done so much more but I felt she was lazy in this role.

B000UR9T7I|2.0|Aside from J/Jonah Jameson scenes.. This movie was lame.  Venom was poorly done, and that was an absolute shame.  Fire Kirsten Dunst already.  She is a horrible Mary Jane and is just dreadful to watch.  It felt too cluttered and the plot was non-existent.  What happened to the crew that gave us the original?       Does anyone feel they should lower their expectations to go to the movies to spend their money on a blockbuster in order to enjoy it?  I don't.  I expect the sequel, if not better, to at least be as entertaining as the original, or not to insult my intelligence the way this movie has.     I feel the writer(s) or director got lazy and knew this film was going to do well at the box office due to the previous 2 movies, and just did a half hearted job. Like the producers are saying \\"Who cares!  It is Spider-man.  People will pay to see garbage as long as we have the Spider-man label it is good to go!\\"      I'm sorry, as much as I loved the original; I feel this sequel was terrible.  The only sequels worst than this were the last the Pirates of the Caribbean  or Rush Hour movies.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I would say this album was way over produced, I would rather hear the real Britney. Her sound is a whole lot better
B0001I55SS|5.0|This movie gave me nightmares as a kid. Disney shows us one of its dark sides with an awesome performance. Maximillion is the scariest robot ever dreamed up. The Cygnus is such a cool space ship. I dont think they had any science advisors for this move which makes it way out there.

Guidence on how powerful this state can be and how to use the this state for healing and wisdom from the universe is included.

1400032717|3.0|I had heard so much about this book that I was curious - masterpiece, original, different, listed as one of the 1001 books you need to read in your lifetime... Maybe it was an expectation issue more than anything else.<br /><br />It is a very well written book with a curious premise - what the world looks like through the eyes of an autistic 15-year-old boy. As his neighbour's dog is murdered he tries to solve the mystery and ends up learning quite a lot about his own life.<br /><br />I thought it was an excellent portrayal of British small city mentality and enjoyed that aspect of it. For me it was also a learning experience, a chance to go through the looking glass and view the world in a new way.
B001FBSMW6|1.0|\\"No.\\" :( That's what I think when I hear this, followed respectively by the added emoticon. They've taken their swaying, soothing music (\\"Bedshaped\\", \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\") and turned it into 80's trip hop. Everyone's making this transition into the techno hip-hop beats, and I for one and disgusted. I loved Keane for that which they produced in the past, paying close attention to \\"Hopes and Fears\\", their first album. They were among those who DIDN'T follow the music crowd into that hopeful \\"toe-tapping\\" beat, but now it seems they have, and I'm just upset. I was so used to their old music, and grabbed this out of nostalgia, and am now regretting it. I will come out forthright and say that this will not meet my standards for \\"playlist material\\".
0439813786|5.0|\\"Hugo Cabret\\" is a great read!  It is a very thick book but an avid reader (probably from teen age and up) could read in a couple of hours, so don't let its size fool you.  The artwork is so beautiful, done in a cross-hatch style; actually the author and illustrator are one and the same.  I have heard this book will be made into a movie next year.      This book can easily be the center of a unit study for homeschoolers, leading to mini-lessons on the topics of film-making, cross-hatch art, automata, clockwork, and myriad other topics which the author discusses.    I highly recommend this book, especially for students who might not necessarily like to read.  It's a 'storybook' for older students!
B001BNFR6W|4.0|I have nothing really negative ot say about this series box set! I thought there may be more cast interviews on the special bonus disc but there is Eric McCormack talking about his favorite episode and you can play it with the commentary as well as Debra Messing's favorite episode, nothing with Megan Mullally or Sean Hayes though. The box set itself is magnetic and really good quality. Overall It's ideal to have for a Will & Grace fan!
B0008ENICU|4.0|The Women is full of great actresses, some funny scenery chewing, and a lot of conniving. Not recommended for any woman who's husband has recently cheated on her--it's too close to the bone.
B000063V8T|4.0|I bought this item new, the fifth season is excellent but the picture quality of the dvd's that I've got is somewhat poor.

B000062XGB|5.0|Received this dvd timely. This is now my new favorite movie. Excellent movie!  Really enjoyed the special features such as edited and extended scenes.  Great romantic screenplay, music devine.  Good history lesson. Very colorful.  May buy an extra one just like it.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko. What a ride, what a character. In fact, I think this kid just had to be my personal hero!  I haved loved this movie for years, and not just loved it. It is like a beautiful, intelligent woman, where you love every part of it, in every way. It is a flawless creation.  The characters are incredible. Donnie is a broodig teenager that any can relate to. He just happens to be visited by the future and traverse space and time. His parents are completely realistic recreations of sad, worried, yet oddly hopeful elders. And his teachers, Noah Wyle, Drew Barrymore, and one crazy lady who loves Patrick Swayze, are all tremendously entertaining figures, in every way.  Many people at the beginning roll their eyes at such a perceivedly dark piece of work, But by the end, they are enlightened, laughing, scared, and astonishingly overjoyed. This movie has a toll on the senses unlike any other. And the hip 80's soundtrack will make any viewer fill with uneasy glee.  There is no need to describe the plot. No one can. It must be deciphered through multiple viewings, and even then, the viewer is left up to their own interpretation. It is an admirable mind-twister, and you will spend many nights awake arguing with yourself over the meaning of the film.  I loved the film. it perfectly blends dark comedy, horror, drama, intution, curiosity, and virtuosity into one complex, compelling mastercraft. And the fact that it is independent with a rookie director only heightens the sense of accomplishment felt here.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Excellent old idea taken to a new level of originality.  Scenes in this picture reminded me of 9/11 and were intense.  Very good effects and terrific acting.  I would highly suggest this film.  My only issue is they handed that camera to the worst camera guy at the begining of the film.  That was annoying.  Reminded me of some of the worst times during other similar films.<br /><br />What other films?  Well since you've asked...<br /><br />The last Broadcast  good idea poor acting claims to have been the first blair witch<br /><br />St Francisville Experement.  Same concept on the paranormal... none-the-less a true story of the paranomral.  I loved it.<br /><br />Blair Witch Project.... Let down... but fun experiement that taught me that films like this were better in a vcr or dvd player... Cloverfield added more professional work to break that thought.<br /><br />Finally.... the true original.... the first that I can remember....<br /><br />Cannibal Holocaust.  Only the trolls should watch this one.  Hard to stomach italian cannibal film that has some real animal death scenes and the first Film inside film concept.  No one here was truly original besides this film, to my knowledge.  This film is hard to watch... I will not own it.

0743243153|5.0|I have not read the entire book but I am on a spiritual journey and I found that this book is taking me there.I would love this book on tape which helps  me to hear and remember it.I've always said I wanted peace and grace and there is a section on grace which I found that I was looking for. I want to buy the followup book  on spiritual growth. I am going to try to find tapes also. The other book is......\\" Spiritual growth in an age of anxiety\\", and I think what better time then now,to discuss what is in this book.  It is written by a well respected physician.
B001AGNMIU|4.0|This isn't a \\"jump\\" horror film. It's considered a horror film for its general eerieness and beautifully creepy images. It's also a horror film for the many decapitations that are found in this film, so if you have a weak stomach, you've been warned.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give out brilliant performances for the younger crowd, while Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson will grab the attention of the older crowd. Christopher Walken is absolutely freaky as the Hessian [headless] horseman, while Christopher Lee's small role is a treat. Casper Van Dien, Ian McDiarmand, Jeffrey Jones, and Michael Gough are an excellent supporting cast.<br /><br />Tim Burton's imagination has been put to good use once again: sets and costumes are truly gothic and beautiful to look at. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay could've improved a bit with more polish and sheen, but it's only a minor flaw. Danny Elfman strikes again with his unique musical style (the main theme will have people shivering).<br /><br />So if you're a Burton or Elfman or Depp or Ricci or Walken fan, then this is the film for you. A-
0452289963|5.0|This book was recommended to me(by my hairdresser who loves these subjects) because I love the fact that I want to be grounded and find out who I truely am.  I found the book very deep with so much information that it was hard(for me) to remember everything,so I decided to read a chapter at a time and discuss it with someone who also read the book, and it helps me  to understand it better.  I think it would be a good book for high school kids to read to reinforce them on finding out so many things about themselves. I found that I really have to go slow with this book before I am ready to go to the next spiritual  book.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|I'd have to say that this isn't really a top favorite from master filmmaker Tim Burton, but it's not at all horrible. It's a classic display of Burton's wild imagination and clever imagery. It's a great comedy, and it's not only Burton's directing that makes it a laughfest. Michael Keaton is perfect as Beetlejuice; I don't think no one else can equally play the character like he does. But it's too bad he only appears in the film in a total of ten minutes. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis shine as the deceased married couple, who want an eccentric family out of their perfect house. Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder give nice performances, and Robert Goulet's cameo appearance is a treat.<br /><br />Oh, and let's not forget Danny Elfman's music score. This is awe-inspiring pre-Batman stuff right here; the main theme is VERY catchy. Art direction and costume design are a plus. The only flaw I can find here is the dance sequence in the end of the film. It's pretty corny, and I find it very annoying. But overall, this is a fun film for the older crowd.
B0018M6J90|5.0|The whole family, from my 87 year old mom to my 18 year old granddaughter, thoroughly enjoyed this light and charming visit to 1930s London.    Miss Pettigrew, having been fired from yet another nanny position due to imposing her \\"daughter of a minister\\" values on the family she was serving, ends up homeless and without money for a room or food. Her luggage has been lost and she is as bereft as a soul could be. Even a visit to the soup kitchen goes badly and leaves her hungry.  Through a bit of chicanery, she ends up as social secretary to a flighty, beautiful and somewhat amoral young singer/actress. What follows is a romantic slightly screwball comedy in the best tradition of 1930s.  Amy Adams was born to play the Carole Lombard type Delysia. Frances McDormand as Guinevere Pettigrew is as downtrodden as can be in the early scenes, and then she does not morph from frump to glamour, but from frump to lovely woman. Ciaran Hinds as Joe is wonderful.  This is a movie we will watch again and again.
0375826726|5.0|This is easily the best of the Inheritance Cycle so far. It had a steady build up to the climax which sets the stage in the next book.
B000002VRZ|2.0|The real original Outlaws broke up after only three studio albums, Outlaws, Lady In Waiting, and Hurry Sundown.  There was also a very good live album.  Every thing that followed is just filler.  Outlaws, Lady In Waiting, Live, and Hurry Sundown could not be any better, great raucous, guitar oriented country rock.   I recommend that you skip this haphazard collection and buy the three real Outlaws albums.  You will be glad you did.
B001E75QGG|1.0|This movie is simply put....stupid. Let me put it this way: If you go back and check the stunts from the previous films, you would think....mmmmm.....40% not plausible but hey, at least 60% plausible and it's FUN as hell!  The stunts in this movie are like 99.99% not plausible, stupid and boring.<br /><br />******WARNING ***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br />You mean to tell me that a guy swinging from tree branches ala Tarzan, went 0 to 50 miles per hour in 10 seconds and catched up with two jeeps in motion going 50 miles an hour? Oh but wait, it gets better, our guy was multitasking, while swinging from the branches in those 10 seconds and besides gaining critical speed, he managed to befriend the monkes that inhabit the trees (no magic involved here, just his charm) and now said monkeys are turned into a deadly fur army whose fury he can unleash at will? Come on! But wait, how about \\"our hero\\" managing to ride for a solid minute with one foot in one jeep and the other foot in the other jeep IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE'S BUMPIEST ROADS? Had this been a highway and the drivers of both cars were on his side I MIGHT'VE  bought it but in the middle of the jungle and with the gracious complicity of the villain driving one of the jeeps? PLLLLLLLLEASE.<br /><br />Shia managed to go from one of the best movies I've ever seen (Transformers) to maybe the worst AAA production I've ever seen: This movie.<br /><br />1998's Godzilla with its NYC cab screeching its tires in the monster's tongue has stepped down from my throne of the implausible just to give room to the new king: this movie and 70% of the main action scenes in it.<br /><br />Has this people ever heard of the premise of SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF? (Go to Wikipedia if you're not familiar with it)<br /><br />All implausibility aside, the movie was just BORING and DULL. I've been a fan of the Indiana movies for a long time and I'm not that kind of die hard fan that demands perfection in exchange of his approval. NO, I'm the kind of fan that will take any bone they throw his way in order to watch an Indy film again while eating popcorn. BUT THIS? This movie is as ridiculous as saying that you could survive a nuclear blast just by hiding in a refrigerator which gets catapulted miles away by the blast and you come out without a scratch.  Mmmm... wait....... THAT HAPPENED TOO!is way in order to watch an Indy film again while eating popcorn. BUT THIS?

B00192KCQ0|4.0|The return of the Four Horsemen! Sounds great, i like it 99%...a couple of tracks doesn't impress me much: \\"Cyanide\\" and \\"The Judas Kiss\\" are pretty cool songs, without the epic and catchy Metallica \\"trash style\\" that you can hear in tracks like \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"My Apocalypse\\".In the end \\"Death Magnetic\\" is just what it needs to be: powerful trash metal with beautiful lyrics. Not a masterpiece like \\"kill 'em all\\" or \\"Master of puppets\\", but really better than \\"load\\" or \\"St. anger\\"...
B000069HK2|4.0|I was very satisfied with my purchase of \\"The Used\\" on compact disc. it was in pretty good shape other than a broken case.

B00000427L|3.0|For price, this is one of the better sets of the complete Rachmaninov concertos to own. This set is a safe set to own if you are not familiar with the works. Andre Previn a notable pianist and conductor conducts the London Symphony Orchestra with Vladimir Ashkenazy at the piano. Ashkenazy is widely considered to be one of the great pianists of our time. All performances are better than average, but there are far better individual performances of these concertos. I recommend Piano Concerto No. 1 with Krystian Zimmerman and Seiji Ozawa, Concerto No. 2 with Benno Moiseiwitcsh and William Kapell with Hugo Rignold and William Steinberg conducting respectively. For Concerto No. 3 I recommend Horowitz with Reiner.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|After two amazing albums (Both Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea were A+ albums for me), it has taken a few listens for my brain to digest and get used to the new \\"lighter-mooded\\" yet bolder-sounding Keane:<br /><br />1 -With a new sound strongly 80s influenced on several songs, that makes the darkness of the lyrics feel light and less important.  The song \\"Better than This\\" even has a The Shins-like comedic quirkiness to it.<br />2- With bolder, less melodic, less sweet and less melancholic/emotional melodies, that have less high and low notes and octave contrasts<br />3- With Tom using his voice in a more Bono-esque, Roy Orbison-esque, and even Bowie-esque manner on several songs.  At times, I even thought one of the other members of the group must be singing.<br />4- With more straight-forward and less poetic, less analogy-based & seemingly less inspired lyrics<br />5- With use of choral bridges<br /><br />If the melodies were as appealing to me as before, I could enjoy the album as much as I did the previous two --- despite the new production.  But the melodies are different and do not appeal to me as much.  As said before, they lack some of the emotion, pungency, and melancholy that previously went straight to my soul, and was felt on the forefront of almost every song in a Keane album.  The notes are flatter.<br /><br />Objectively, the melodies are as good --- just different.  The same goes for the album overall.  It is as good as the previous two --- just different.<br /><br />Personally, if you asked me to tell you the best song of Under the Iron Sea, I would have a hard time deciding and 6-7 of them would be contenders.  The same to a lesser degree goes for Hopes and Fears.  But if you asked me the same question for Perfect Symmetry, only 4 songs would be contenders: Again and Again, The Lovers Are Loosing, Perfect Symmetry, and Spiralling (which is a great tune, but does not feel like a Keane song at all).<br /><br />So it comes down to a \\"personal taste\\" issue for me.  I like it less and rate it a B+<br /><br />****AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FURTHER AND FURTHER, I RATE IT AN \\"A-\\"t a B+    ****AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FURTHER AND FURTHER, I RATE IT AN \\"A-\\"
B0012Q732O|2.0|This movie is about a tribe of people living somewhere in the Eurasian landmass.  One day during winter, an adopted girl in their tribe is carried of by horsemen.  Three men (Ka'ren, D'leh, Tic-Tic) and one boy of the tribe follow them all the way to North Africa where they come across a pyramid being built by slave labor.  D'leh leads an uprising which frees the slaves and free the girl.  So that is the entire storyline.  Along the way the meet and befriend other tribes, and encounter various beasts.  As a movie, this would have been above-par if it was released in the 1980s.  But for the 21st century, this is a sub-par movie; for several reasons.  The primal flaw of the movie is the perfect English spoken by the main characters.  Though grunts and groans would have been awkward, the writers did give other tribes in the movie distinct, yet unreconizable languages, so why couldn't they do it with the main characters also?  The 2nd flaw of the movie is the simplicity, and plain orthodoxy of the plot.  Basically, we have a simple boy grow up, falls in love, travels across the known world to save her, and in the process rescue thousands from slavery.  Sounds like a adhoc mix of Spartacus, Kingdom of Heaven, Stargate, Pirates of the Caribbean, and a dozen other action - adventure movies over the past several decades.  The good thing is the family - friendliness of the movie; minimal blood, no gore, no nudity or close-up shots of anyone getting eaten.  Overall, an OK movie.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I'm enjoying the new songs but all the life has been squeezed out of the tracks from excessive compression. Lars claims that it's just a few internet whiners that don't know how music is made in 2008. Really? All that clipping is how music is made in 2008? Maybe it's time to go \\"retro\\" and master music for quality and let the user work the volume knob.
B000286RNY|5.0|From the beginning of the movie, I was laughing my hindquarters off... Granted there were some awkward moments and some slow moments. But overall, the movie made me laugh (pretty hard in a few places).<br /><br />I really didn't care for [[ASIN:B000QGEB12 Kung Fu Hustle]] and thought [[ASIN:B000BNXD6Y The White Dragon]], [[ASIN:B000244GOA Kung Phooey!]] and [[ASIN:B000NA2TS8 Where Is Mama's Boy]] were all rather sophomoric attempts at spoofs. I did laugh pretty hard at [[ASIN:B000O76T72 Kung Pow - Enter The Fist]], but I still think that Shaolin Soccer is the better \\"movie.\\" It actually felt like fully-fledged movie rather than a strung out set of slapstick and sight gags.<br /><br />It was definitely reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000XPU66U Balls of Fury]] in tone and plot, however. But, again, I think it came off much better.<br /><br />I'd actually recommend this movie for fans of the kung fu genre who are looking for a light-hearted spoof that still somewhat bottles a little bit of the kung fu genre's spirit.
0375826726|5.0|I loved this book.  My mother got me started on the Inheritance Cycle just after the first one came out.  I've always loved fantasy and when my mom said 'Here try this one.'  I was excited and curious.  I'd never heard of Chris before and realized this was a new writer.  I was wondering if his stories were good or if they weren't worth the effort.  Oh was I happy.  It was awesome.  I loved it.  And now that the third one has come out....I knew it would be better.  The books in a series are always better past the second.  The first is the classic that started it all.  The second is the filler.  And the third; the third begins the adventure.  And was I excited but also a little disappointed to realize there will be another.  Disappointed to know that the story hadn't ended; but excited to know I'd be able to continue to read this story and that more would happen.  I love long series because it never ends.  There's always more to read and see.  I hope this one turns out to be one that just doesn't end abruptly.  I've found those kinds of stories to be rather annoying.  You get to the best part that would seem to take forever...and it ends.  Just like that.  Please, Mr. Paolini...don't make it end just like that.  Your series is turning out to be the best I've read...Don't make it end just like that.  Thank you for all your hard work in making what I consider one of the best series I've read.  Your up there with Kevin Anderson(Saga of Seven Suns) and Robert Jordan(Wheel of Times).  Have a good year!  And wish you the best!
B0014WAC3I|4.0|Bought it to relive a bit of my childhood. While it's still more-or-less funny, etc., it didn't age especially well. It very much \\"looks\\" like an 80's film (the hair, clothes and the special effects) and sounds like an 80's movie (dialogue, music, etc.).<br /><br />But, it's still rather entertaining! Has a few special features decent picture quality, considering the source material. I think it's mainly good for the nostalgia value...
B001AX60KU|5.0|Excellent collection.  I love to hear different versions of him singing his songs.  I realy love to hear Elvis and the guys talking between songs, fooling around, and putting the songs together.  Extra bonus hearing Elvis' voice both sing and tell stories.
0765316897|5.0|The action continues in the final installment of the Mistborn trilogy. Many questions are answered and the surprises continue until the very last page. The characters are endearing and the plot engaging. Brandon's writing just keeps improving. This is his best book yet.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|Although this album is heavily produced (you thought those paragraphs in the CD insert were lyrics to the songs--No, they're just the endless credits!) it has major cross-over appeal. It has radio-friendly pop (I thought 'Shut up and Drive' was sung by Pink until I came across Rihanna.) and even the hard-to-classify World beat of 'Lemme Get That'. A lot of variety and one of those CDs where you will like most of the songs on the first listen.

B00005JPO1|5.0|Watch the Bonus Features about the making of this movie!  When movie producers bring a series back to life, they usually steal the fun from the original by trying to \\"update\\" it and change it.  In this case, they didn't and that's what makes this a GREAT movie.  I loved the first three Indiana Jones movies and I eagerly looked forward to this one.  I was not disappointed at all!  I loved how this movie was just like the old ones.  There weren't inconsistencies like there usually are when people try to bring a movie series back to life.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|What can I say. Im not going to rate the movie because everyone know what it is. I will rate the Blu-Ray quality and I give it 2 Thumbs Up.  The colors and bright scenes pop.  With these older transfers the black/dark scenes seem to be a bit grainy. Overall, a very good buy!
0446613444|4.0|The Black Ice is Michael Connelly's second book in his series of Harry Bosch novels.  What makes his books special is the combination of an interesting and complex main character with fascinating story lines that are complex enough to keep you on your toes, but also fun and engaging.<br /><br />In this installment, Bosch discovers that a suicide of a narcotics officer might actually be a homicide, and that the officer may have been playing both sides.  The story bogs down a bit when Bosch travels to Mexico, and the story started to veer off into 3 star territory, but for me, the ending redeemed this book.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" unfolds as a frenzied nightmare in living color, a kaleidoscope of hellish events.  As this movie spins more and more out of control toward total chaos, the tension ratchets up to an all but unbearable degree.  For me, the climax of this movie comes as Batman mounts his Batpod, an armored motorcycle, and chases the Joker through Gotham.  From this point on, the film becomes frantic, terrifying, intense, and mesmerizing.<br /><br />The whole city of Gotham is turned on its head in anarchy, as is the Joker himself finally, by Batman when he suspends the Joker from a cable upside down from a skyscraper in the dead of night.<br /><br />The proponent of chaos, the Joker, ends up hanging upside down, spinning and laughing maniacally in space, without any sense of direction--the perfect ending image for the nihilistic Joker.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is nothing short of brilliant with his chilling portrayal of the maleficent, unhinged Joker.  He cringes and leaps about like a dynamic psychotic fiend, propelling the nonstop action farther and farther into the abyss--from which there is no escape without Batman, the reluctant hero crippled by self-doubt.<br /><br />This is the best comic-book movie I've ever seen.  What with its shades of grey and complexity of characters, it transcends its black-and-white superhero format to become much more.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday

B000EOUSJU|5.0|THE HOOPLE is yet another masterpiece for Mott The Hoople, completing a cycle that started with ALL THE YOUNG DUDES and continued with the psychodrama of MOTT. This CD includes seven bonus cuts, some featuring guitarist Mick Ronson, who'd replaced Ariel Bender (Luther Grosvenor) following the latter's mid-tour departure. Elsewhere, Bender proves himself as worthy a guitarist as HIS predecessor, Mick Ralphs. If you buy this CD along with MOTT, ALL THE YOUNG DUDES, IAN HUNTER, YOU'RE NEVER ALONE WITH A SCHIZOPHRENIC, WELCOME TO THE CLUB, RANT, and SHRUNKEN HEADS, you'll have yourself the perfect Ian Hunter/Mott The Hoople library.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|It's been a long 8 years but finally it's been worth it. Let's go through each track.  1. Rock and roll train. Good beat, good lyrics, not a bad choice for a single. This wouldn't be my first choice for an opener.  2. Skies on fire. It's got a good beat but it kind of falls flat. This is not a terrible song but it's not that great either.  3. Big Jack. This is an interesting song. Kind of reminds me of Last Action Hero. Maybe it's just me. This song takes a few listens to grow on you.  4. Anything Goes. This song marks a milestone for Brian Johnson being that it's the first song sung in the key of D. This does not sound like it would be an AC/DC song. It's good but sounds like it should be sung by someone else. Still a good song and helps tie the album together.  5. War Machine. Great song. This should've been the first single. Some have said this is a political song, but it's not and was confirmed by Angus Young during the CD release party.   6. Smash N Grab. Good song and great guitar work. This is my third favorite on the album.  7. Spoilin' for a Fight. Good Track and keeps your head bopping throughout.   8. Wheels. It's an ok track. To me it seems like this doesn't belong on the album but still good to listen to.  9. Decibel. Good bluesy track. Makes me think of the song ballbreaker. I noticed some of the guitar work from Malcolm is the same. Definately worth listening to.  10. Stormy May Day. Song starts like a country song. Brians voice doesn't sound right on this. This song is a definate skip for me. Almost has the feel of the song Go Zone  11. She likes Rock and Roll. The bass doesn't seem to fit right at the beginning of the song. This sounds more like Buckcherry should be doing it. Some of the lyrics sound like something that should be in musical theater. It's not a completely crappy song but it's near it.  12. Money Made. Good sounding and well put together. If you liked Hail Ceaser or The Furor you'll like this song  13. Rock and roll dream. This song is horrible and is not an AC/DC song. This is just wrong  14. Rocking all the Way. The title says it all  15. Black Ice. This songs belongs as the fifth track. It's good and worth listening to.  All In all this album goes to show that they're back and still rocking. If you're new to ac/dc don't start with this album
B001E7X4M4|4.0|First off let me say that In The Eyes Of Fire is to date, Unearth's finest hour. That album kicked you in the teeth from start to finish and every song had an amazing hook at some point in it. It was a little more metal than The Oncoming Storm and the guitars cut through me like a buzzsaw. I don't really like reviewing albums until I have fully digested them and although The March hasn't left my CD player since last Tuesday, I still don't think I have let the songs grow on me enough. This album is definitely more hardcore. The riffs and breakdowns all have that east coast hardcore feel. So far the songs that have really jumped out at me are Grave of Opportunity and both parts of the untitled track. Maybe I will come back and write another review after letting the album sink in but for right now I will say that it rocks but isn't quite as good as In The Eyes Of Fire, but I don't know if Unearth will ever be able to top that masterpiece.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I bought this album with the promise this was going to harder and sound like classic Metallica. Disappointment central. If you liked saint anger then you will like this. The band fell apart after the black album. Even the black album had awful tracks like Nothing else matters for example. For me and many fans The last great album was And Justice for all.   This album is a travesty. I gave it a fair shot and listened to it 3 times and it's horrible. Lars can't play drums like he used to, Trujilo doesn't belong, Kirk doesn't play well, but the only thing going for them is James can still sing. Yes the band sold out just like the Red Hot Chili Peppers did even though most don't see it that way. This album only contains 2 worth while tracks otherwise it's crap. The new AC/DC blows this album out of the water. It's no wonder why Jason left the band.
0765316897|4.0|Hero of Ages is the final book of the Mistborn Trilogy. Sanderson wraps his first published attempt at an epic fantasy so nicely, you'd love to read another trilogy set in the same world. Hero of Ages depicts the struggle of mankind against entropy personified. Sanderson does an excellent job of creating an antagonist out of the god-like primal force that is threatening the world. Not many authors would even make an attempt at a villain that is so potentially nebulous, but Sanderson pulls it off.     His characterizations in Hero of Ages are not as strong as the previous books, especially Final Empire (the first book). However, that is to be expected in the final book of a trilogy. We already know the characters, we don't need lots of screen time with each one in order to understand their actions and rationalizations.     A problem that some people may have with the book is thinking that it is about Vin and Elend - the main characters from the first 2 books. They are main characters again, but they share the spotlight with many other characters - some of those characters play equally prominent roles in the outcome. In most fantasy series, subsequent novels are simply a continuation of the previous novel's story. Hero of Ages is a separate story from Final Empire and Well of Ascension. The characters and world are the same and the events in the first two books build up to the climax in the final book, but the third story stands by itself.     The pacing of the book is excellent. The short chapters and changes of viewpoint keep the action moving and there are few points where the story labors. The chapter bumps (the intros to each chapter) explain why the world is the way it is and provide a wealth of information about how things fit together. Sanderson ties up many loose ends using the narrative in the chapter bumps - as opposed to having an appendix or lengthy and derivative epilogue.     Without giving anything away - the story is true to itself. Everything fits together neatly, and certainly would be less of a story if changed in any way.     I've loved the series. It is fresh, exciting, and adds flavor to the Fantasy genre that's been missing for some time.
B0013YTSHS|5.0|If you haven't heard the CD or seen the DVD you are really missing out! Joe has put out his best yet! I listen to the CD over & over & I never get tired of it. Of course Joe is also incredible in concert as well. I will be seeing him in about 3 weeks at the House of Blues in San Diego. If you've never been to a 'JS' or 'Satch' concert you are really missing out! I can't wait to see him play the songs from this latest CD live! I have met Joe on several different occasions, and I can honestly say for a person with his talent & abilities he is a really super nice guy too! This is the 2nd copy of this CD/DVD combo that I have purchased, this one a birthday gift for my son who is deploying to Iraq for his 2nd tour very soon. I know he will love it!

B00104W8T6|5.0|The JUNO SOUNDTRACK is off beat and zany, but it is great fun to listen to.  This CD is enjoyed by everyone in my family:  my husband, 11 year old daughter, 3 year old daughter, and me.  It is one of our favorite CDs to listen to in the car, and since we all have such divergent tastes, that says a lot right there.<br /><br />The first song, \\"All I Want is You\\" is a favorite of the 3 year old.  She calls it \\"The Harmonica Song,\\" and knows all the words better than I do.  The lyrics to this folksy song are very cute, and it is accompanied by, of course, a harmonica as well as an acoustic guitar.  This is one I don't mind listening to repeatedly, as is her wont at this age.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are equally whimsical and quirky, some without words, some you have heard before (\\"Dearest\\" by Buddy Holly), some interesting, all just plain enjoyable.  The voices are all earthy and unique, and I find myself drawn to them.  It is kind of like being at a sing-a-long with a bunch of close friends.<br /><br />The JUNO SOUNDTRACK is great for my family during long car trips.  There is peace, harmony, good music, and no bickering.  Hey, that alone makes this a highly recommended and very valuable asset.

6305161879|5.0|I didn't think that I was going to adore this movie as much as I do; don't really know why, but my expectations were rather low.  I know, Kline had won the Oscar and so maybe that should have sparked a little more interest, or at least faith in me, but I still saw this as a movie I was going to be mildly enthused about at best.  I was so wrong, for as the film started rapidly drawing to a close I found myself uttering aloud \\"this movie is outrageous\\" and I meant that in a wildly good way.<br /><br />The film tells the story of American jewel thief Wanda who uses her charm to seduce men whom she needs in order to get her hands on some very valuable diamonds.  Her lover Georges and his stuttering companion Ken help Wanda steal the jewels with the aid of Otto, another man whom Wanda has seduced and is passing off as her brother.  She has deceived each man into believing that her intentions are to share the jewels with them, when her intention is to take them for herself.  When Georges is captured by the police after moving the diamonds away from their initial hiding place Wanda begins to set her charms on Archie Leach, Georges barrister, hoping to find out the new location of the diamonds.  All the while she continues to string along each individual man, adding layer upon layer of lies to keep them pacified until she has all her ducks in a row so-to-speak.<br /><br />But nothing ever works out as expected.<br /><br />The film is hilarious from start to finish, a complete laugh-riot, and the performances by the entire cast are Oscar worthy.  Jamie Lee Curtis is adorable here, delivering what may be her finest performance ever.  She is sly, conniving, sexy and charming; never allowing her characters tricks to overshadow her performance but always playing to her strengths and delivering a brilliantly crafted comedic performance.  Michael Palin is also rather great as Ken, and Maria Aitken has a very memorable supporting role as Archie's wife Wendy.  John Cleese is golden as Archie, the lovelorn barrister who falls for Wanda's undeniable charm; but it is Kevin Kline (Oscar winner Kevin Kline) who steals this movie with his comedic delivery.  He is one-hundred percent on the top of his game here, delivering a strangely perverse yet fully fleshed out character who is unforgettable to say the least.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and he is so the leading male character here, regardless of whose name gets top billing.<br /><br />`A Fish Called Wanda' is, without doubt, one of the best films of 1988, and it is seriously one of the greatest comedies I have seen in a long time.  It hits every mark beautifully and creates an eclectic cast of characters who all feel real and all feel complete.  Oscar hit a high note when crowning Kline an Oscar winner; it's just too bad it was in the wrong category.as Archie, the lovelorn barrister who falls for Wanda's undeniable charm; but it is Kevin Kline (Oscar winner Kevin Kline) who steals this movie with his comedic delivery.

0375826726|4.0|I have enjoyed this series from the start. C. Paolini is a talented writer and you can watch him grow with each successive novel. I look forward to reading the continuation of the Inheritance Cycle and to any other projects he take on.
B000059TFO|5.0|My best friend and I had a discussion about Gene Hackman the other day, since both of us are huge fans.  We were recounting some of our favorite Hackman performances (`Unforgiven', `Hoosiers') and I was suggesting to him Hackman films he needed to see (`The Royal Tenenbaums') and he was suggesting ones I needed to see (`Crimson Tide') and then we came to the subject of `Mississippi Burning' and realized that neither of us had seen it.  So, I told him I was coming over and on my way I rented this film and we had a few beers and watched one of the best Hackman films either of us had ever seen.<br /><br />Not just one of his best movies; one of his best performances!<br /><br />`Mississippi Burning' (inspired by a true story) tells the tragic tale three young rights activists who were murdered in a small Mississippi town.  Two white boys and one black, the local police department sweeps it under the rug, but when word that the boys are missing reaches the FBI two agents are sent to the town to investigate.  Rupert Anderson is an ex-Mississippi sheriff himself and so he has a better idea of how to deal with the locals than his partner, the young and `by-the-book' agent Alan Ward.  Alan is asking all the wrong questions at the wrong time to the wrong people and is stirring up more problems than he should; but Rupert is slinking around in the background, building trust with valuable witnesses who may in the end be able to help him tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />The film is brilliantly crafted, building tension in all the right places and balancing out the violence with a brutal message of injustice and tolerance.  There are so many technical aspects of this film that really grabbed me, like the use of gospel hymns during some of the more savage scenes; creating a mood, an air of melancholy as apposed to brutality.  It is small touches like that that bring the film to another level, eliciting in the audience the desired emotional response.  Sure, we are angered by what it taking place, but our anger is more repressed and tempered.  We wind up more saddened and disappointed which, in my opinion, carries the weight of the film farther than just steeping our reaction in pure hatred.<br /><br />Like Alan Ward brings to light towards the films closing; we are all guilty if we allow atrocities like this to happen; if we say nothing when we know we have the obligation to stand up for what we know is right.<br /><br />The film is strengthened also by the marvelous performances that litter the screen, most notably by the two Oscar nominees; Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand.  Frances is not on the screen for a very long time, but her control over her character is dominant.  You can really feel her emotional connection to Mrs. Pell, her struggle to find steady ground as she tries to decide where her loyalties need to be staked.  Gene Hackman is seriously at the top of his game here, delivering what may be his finest performance ever.  I love the transformation his character makes, and this is seen in one particular scene where he joins a few suspects for a beer.<br /><br />\\"Thanks for the beer.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally impressive, from Willem Dafoe's stubborn take on Ward to Brad Dourif's devilishly squirmy Clinton Pell.  R. Lee Ermey is magnificent as the corrupt Mayor and supporting players like Sartain, Rooker and especially Tobolowsky clutter the film with brilliance.<br /><br />The film is an acting goldmine.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this brilliant film.  There is such a dark yet poignant message here that to me is universal.  This is one of those films that, while broaching one particular subject, really opens itself up to a universally important message.  The film is not merely a film about racism but a film about injustice and the obligation each living breathing human has to right wrongs, no matter how inconvenient that may be.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|And those Englishmen that I speak of are Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, and Keith Moon, better known to the rock world and their fans as The Who.  In this 1979 rockumentary directed by Jeff Stein, the band is shown in classic clips performing some of their best songs.  When it opens, we see them performing \\"My Generation\\" on \\"The Smothers Brothers Show\\".  After the documentary's titles are shown, we cut to a clip of them singing \\"I Can't Explain\\" on what would be the last broadcast of \\"Shindig\\", ABC's evening answer to their ever-popular \\"American Bandstand\\".  About a half-hour or so into the movie, we're treated to their electrifying performance of \\"See Me, Feel Me/Listening to You\\" at the 1969 Woodstock Festival.  In between these rocking performances, we get to see the four men reveal their true selves during interviews, such as the one done by English TV show host Russell Harty.  Here, you get to see them display their sense of humor, with Harty not batting an eye.  They are also asked, by various fans, questions on topics ranging from drugs to looks.  Although all four members are interviewed, none is interviewed more often than Pete Townshend, who presents a thoughtful, serious side of himself.  Of course, no Who documentary would be complete without clips of him destroying his guitar during concerts, for which he is legendary.  During the \\"Smothers Brothers\\" segment, after Tom watches Townshend destroy his guitar, he tells his brother Dick to bring his guitar (so that Townshend could destroy it!).  We also get to see drummer Keith Moon during his crazy, maniacal moments and on the drums.  I would say he was The Who's equivalent of The Beatles's Ringo Starr, who, by the way, we see talking to Moon.  Throughout this whole movie, we hear the best that these guys had to offer, including the aforementioned \\"My Generation\\" (we also get treated to a clip of them singing it at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival), \\"I Can't Explain\\", \\"Teenage Wasteland\\", \\"Happy Jack\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Magic Bus\\", and at the end, \\"Long Live Rock\\".    These men knew how to rock; their music defined a generation.  If you're a fan and think that they rock, like I do, then you should no doubt love this showcase of one of the best rock bands of all time.

B00005R87Q|5.0|The Fast and the Furious is not too bad. The plot line is predictable but is presented in a way that makes it entertaining. There are some scenes that are not believable and could have been better. The most glaring are the robbery scenes. It is just a miss match that is so obvious the director ignores until the end of the film.  The acting of Pawl Walker as Brian O'Conner and Vin Diesel as Domminic Toretto are not bad. There are few difficult scenes that will make you wince but overall it is workable. The chase scenes are generally good but the opening scenes is painful to watch. It just does not appear plausible and does not make much sense.  Overall, not bad

B000H7JCG4|5.0|Although I was too young to watch 90210 when it originally aired, I began watching it soon after it ended, and have since been watching the re-runs on TV throughout the years (mainly on SOAPnet) and it has easily become one of my favorite shows, especially Shannen Doherty (one of my favorite actresses) was a main character (aka Brenda Walsh) during the first four seasons. Anyway, I'm very greatful that this season, along with seasons 1-5 (soon to be 6 also) have been released, and hopefully seasons 7-10 will soon follow. And yes, it is disappointing that music has been changed, and scenes have been cut, but I'm still have to be able to own this show on DVD (after all, I can watch the original versions on TV, but with the DVDs, ill be able to watch my favorite episodes anytime I want!)    Although some of the earlier seasons have a lot of episodes that may be considered tacky and laughable nowadays (especially season 1, seeing as how it started in 1990!) I love them because like I said, they feature Shannen Doherty, and during season 1 you get to see her characters relationship with Dylan Mckay, played by Luke Perry (in my opinion, they will always be one of the cutest TV couples ever!)    Now I'm sure for the most part, a majority of you have heard of \\"90210\\" and have atleast seen an episode or two (after all, the show was on for 10 years!) but here's a brief summary of season 1, just in case:    The long-running series begins with the arrival of the Walsh family (brenda, Brandon, and their two parents, Jim and Cindy), who move from Minnesota to Beverly Hills. Brenda (played by Shannen Doherty) and her twin brother, Brandon (played by Jason Priestley) have different ways of adjusting to their new home. Brenda quickly befriends Kelly Taylor, the most popular girl in school, and begins to feel the pressures that come along with running in such a social circle (in the early episodes she gets a fake ID, sneaks into a club where she meets an older guy and lies to him about her age, and even plans on losing her virginity to him until he finds out her true age) meanwhile, Brandon has a harder time fitting in, until he befriends Steve Sanders (the most popular guy in school) joins the school newspaper, run by Andrea Zuckermann (aka the school-nerd, played by Gabrielle Carteris) and becomes friends with a cute, mysterious loner named Dylan Mckay (played by Luke Perry, who eventually becomes Brendas boyfriend and first love) also among the cast? Donna Martin (played by Tori Spelling) who is a friend of Kelly's, and David Silver (played by Brian Austin Green) a geeky freshman who is desperate to be popular (he eventually becomes part of the infamous 90210 gang) and crashes Steve Sanders car in the pilot episode when Steve drunkenly insists that he drive his car home for him.    During this season, you'll see how Brenda and Brandon adjust to life in Beverly Hills, Brendas new popular girl status, find out that Kelly Taylor isn't as perfect and problem free as people perceive her to be, how Brandon and Dylan become friends...etc...and best of all: how Dylan and Brenda meet, and the beginning of their two-year relationship (I never grow tired of watching the \\"spring fling\\" episode, in which Brenda loses her virginity to him!)    The thing I love most about this show is the great chemistry that all the actors have together (which you'll continue to see grow as the show progresses)    So if you still have not watched this show, what are you waiting for?!
0385338724|5.0|I love the Shopaholic Series and the character of Becky Bloomwood. I found the character of Lexi Smart to be just as enjoyable. This book had some hilarious moments. It's another smart, funny, and sexy novel from Sophie Kinsella. It's hard to put down!
0765316897|5.0|I can't say enough of the excellence of writer Brandon Sanderson. If you love reading a series, but find that the last book of the series is a let down, TRUST me, this author DOESN'T have that problem. Brandon Sanderson masterfully orchestrates this finale with the strokes of a genius. I have followed most of his books and find his writing to be both refreshing and intense. This book puts them all to shame. He develops his characters very well, even those the reader has forgotten about. The way he draws his story to its conclusion will shock and amaze the readers. The first sentence of this book sets the intensity high, and it steadily builds until the climax at the end of the book. After this book, you will be a Sanderson Fanatic, if you aren't one already!!!!  I have read other reviews, some that have left me scratching my head, but regardless, this book is simply a great finish to a great series!

More than just hip - it's sophisticated. Domino editors did a wonderful job of making this part eye candy and reference guide.     Instead of just pretty pictures, you get some professional design guidance. Inspiring for those who've been decorating for a while - very fresh.  But even better for first-time home/apartment buyer/renter.  Most people don't have the money to hire a designer for their first apartment or house, this book can provide some nice guidance.  There are lots of space solutions, color guides.      One of the best features is the \\"decorator's handbook\\" section which has line drawings and descriptions of decorating elements - so you can explain what you are looking for with the right terminology. Buying guide is also very helpful!

B00005JPO1|2.0|When I heard this movie was being made, and that Harrison Ford had agreed to once again portray the sexiest archeologist EVER, I was very excited and waited with great anticipation for it's release. Granted, I know that he's aged, but so have I, so I didn't find an aged Indiana Jones daunting.  Then I started hearing rumors - whisperings about how the movie was going to disappoint.  Then Spielberg and Lucas started spreading their own rumors -<br /><br />\\"It's 100% faithful to the franchise\\".... \\"It's absolutely Indiana Jones\\".. etc., etc..  Optimism, for certain, but why?<br /><br />My anticipation lifted once again, but I decided not to view any commercials or previews for the movie, nor to read any articles reviewing it, until I had a chance to see it for myself, untainted by the opinions of others.  And, I have to say, when I finally saw the movie, I was very disappointed.  National Treasures 2 was what this movie should have been - in fact, I kept finding aspects of National Treasures 2 in this movie, which made me wonder if the sets and action sequences were directed and produced by the same people.  It's that similiar, and sadly, Nat'l Treasures 2 (being the true ripoff of Indy) was better.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is a fine actress, but her performance as a USSR secret agent left me pining for that Nazi woman in the third Indy movie. At least she had screen presence with Harrison Ford.  And Shia LaBouf - I don't get it.  He's okay - he's not great - but his character was too predictably intertwined (and seemingly uninterested) with Harrison Ford's, and Shia seemed unnecessary.  If you cut him out, you could make the movie without him, and though it would still be a stinker of a film, at least Mr. LaBouf wouldn't be forever tainted by it.<br /><br />The treatment of Indy's dead father was understandable (as Sean Connery refused to do the movie), but the colleague who's statue is defiled (can't recall his name) was unnecessary.  Why dishonor that character in such a way?  And no explanation as to why he, too, was dead?<br /><br />Karen Allen's part was vague, with very little development, as though Spielberg sprinkled a little Karen Allen in the soup for some added flavor.  She should have had more to do, better lines, a deeper character, such as her original role in the first Indy movie.  Here, sadly, she was simply screen filler.  Even her relationship with Harrison Ford seemed forced; no spark as with the original movie.  Sadly, she, too, could have been written out and the movie would not have suffered for it.  Neither would our memories of Karen Allen's performance in the original movie.<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but aliens DO NOT belong in an Indiana Jones movie.  Yes, I get it - he's aged and we need to see him in situations decades after his last adventure - but why aliens?  Couldn't the Soviet spies be doing something else?  Couldn't the crystal skull have meant something more?  What about the existing legends surrounding the skulls?  Where was that? Archeology nearly didn't exist in this movie - there was no true Soviet nemesis to antagonize Indy - Cate Blanchett's character was more like that Nazi-guy from the first movie - the guy who's face melted?  Her character was more like his; he was not the antagonist in the first movie, nor should she have been the antagonist in this movie.  An 'evil' archeologist would have added more to the story than a leather-clad, bondage-queen Russian who can somehow speak to aliens with her mind.<br /><br />To sum it up, this movie was bad.  It saddens me to say that, too, because I've been a Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones fan for a long time.  I loved all three of the movies made twenty years ago. I've seen them each dozens of times, more times than I can count. And I honestly could care less if I ever see this one again.  I ordered the DVD for my husband, who wants to complete his collection, but I don't think either of us will be viewing it more than once.such a way?

0156034026|3.0|Allegorically interesting, but I didn't quite buy into the point of view -- I found the 1st person \\"overheard conversation\\" occasionally both jarring and implausible. Also, I'm afraid I found the ending a bit too clever-clever. I think if the author had tried to tell the tale more simply, he might have come closer to success.
B00005JPO1|1.0|Worst Indy movie by far, If you haven't seen this movie keep in mind that the movie starts when Indy gets blown up by a nuclear bomb and fly's for miles in an old refrigerator. And then it gets worse. Aliens, Mind Control, Swinging like Tarzan through the jungle, man eating ants, dimensional portals? 3 waterfalls and a cliff? Also, since when is Indy a war veteran who also works for the CIA? I always thought he was a archaeology professor. I bet you that Spielberg wanted to make sure that no one would every harass him again about making another Indy movie. I bet he succeeded.
B0017WI5VQ|4.0|Adele is a young soulstress from London, England with a voice that defies her youthful years. On this, she delivers possibly the best debut album from a UK artist in 2007. Best tracks 'Chasing Pavements', 'Cold Shoulder', 'Hometown Glory' and 'To Make You Feel My Love', all make the entrance fee worthwhile. I have a feeling that this young lady will be around for quite a while. Not just a fad but a quality artist at work here.

0321544080|3.0|As photography books, especially instructional ones, go this is definitely an interesting one. The layout is really good and the images nothing short of stunning. Mr. McNally's thoughts and advice are written in an easily understandable and very approachable manner. All very well, then.    Well, not entirely. Many reviewers before me have mentioned that there are few real pieces of advice as how to go out and produce shots similiar to those presented. There are plenty of hints and 'I got hold of helicopter and had my fleet of assistants doing this and that to get the proper lighting on the King of Siberia while the catering firm truck was just in the right spot for creating the right shadows', which creates the feeling, at least to me, that the author (who is a great photographer) just tells stories about why he is as good as he is (this is not boring or bad as such, mind you, just not what one is expecting). If you know all there is to know about lighting and creative photography, I guess you could look at the advice in this book and say 'oh yeah, I forgot about that. Let's do it this way', but unless you're quite good with lamps and lights, there's not enough to be had here. I have definitely learned, from most of the advice in this book, that one needs an assistant, 5 flashes, tons of reflectors, and all kinds of other stuff to get any sort of portrait in the field as well as in the studio. There are, in other words, not enough tips on shooting for amateurs in the field (in my opinion).     With danger of sounding hippocritical, I'll say that some of the advice (sold as 'nuggets of wisdom' in the foreword by S. Kelby) is a bit on the simple side (\\"Bring your camera\\"?). It's not a big problem, though (you can't have a book tailored to just your own needs, can you now? And this one does actually cover quite a bit of ground).     There is also a slight problem with the writing. Approachable and easily understandable as it is, I think that the language at times is abit too... colloquial. \\"Then I was like...\\", \\"Dat's one fine lookin' photo subject\\", and the like makes it all a bit too... well, colloquial, for me.     There are some photographs in here, though, and hints and advice are never a waiste of time. It's just not the book it could have, or indeed should have, been.    2,5 stars
B00004RF97|3.0|This 1940s film is supposed to be a classic.  That's why it interested me.  Originally adapted from a play, it stars Katherine Hepburn as a Philadelphia \\"main line\\" self-absorbed young woman.  Recently divorced from Cary Grant, she is planning a marriage to someone else.  But with the help of James Stuart and Ruth Hussy, Cary Grant sets about winning back his lady love.<br /><br />My recollections of Katherine Hepburn are as an old lady, so it was a delight to see her young and gorgeous self.  The role called for a lot of dialogue and a lot of shifting emotions.  Despite her artificial makeup, she did a great job and I can understand the reason she left her indelible mark on the silver screen.  She's unique in her own special way and she did the best she could with the material written for her.<br /><br />Too bad the screenplay just did not stand the test of time.  Despite its attempt to be smart and sophisticated, it's now 68 years later, and it came across to my modern mind as contrived and silly and too heavy on the dialog.<br /><br />I give this film a mild recommendation for students of movie history.  But for everyone else, don't waste your time.
B000002U9L|5.0|I highly, highly, highly recommend this cd/ soundtrack. It is one of the best I've ever heard. Being a David Bowie fan and having seen the movie, I loved his songs and bought it just for that, but the sound effects and all of the other tracks are as mystical as the movie. So if you want a good, enthralling listen, this is the cd for you. Without a doubt.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|This album is a three and a half star effort, at least.  I got into this band based on their performance of \\"Slow Night, So Long\\" on a TV special about Bonneroo 2004.  Then I got Aha Shake Heartbreak and Because Of The Times. Yeah, they've kind of gone from an angular Indie version of southern rock with brit rock and pop influences, to a more polished U2 and even Radiohead influenced sound. But a lot has remained the same: the lead vocalist is very distinctive--he has this growly southern voice like no other and, let's face it, the bass player has always sounded a bit like Adam Clayton of U2 or whomever plays bass for the Cure (a decidedly English slant to those four strings, a captive of the pocket he is not). I don't think this band is attempting to \\"sell out\\" in a way that is a betrayal of the sound they had two CDs ago, I think they're simply now emphasizing certain elements that have always been in their music, and also adding new sounds the way a lot of bands do in their younger years. Clearly, this is not an AC/DC type band that is going to make the same music ten times over (I like AC/DC, by the way).     I saw KOL live last night, and while the highlight for me was \\"Slow Night, So Long\\" (probably because that's the song that hooked me into this band, and is one of their most unfettered and purely rocking tracks), I have to say all the stuff from Only By The Night and Because Of The  Times played really well.  This is a good band.  Yes, some of the songs on the last two CDs are arena-ready, but so what? I think they pull it off in a way that isn't embarassing, but rather pretty cool. I can hear why a song like Use Somebody can come off as a little too radio-friendly to fans of the \\"old sound\\", but if I have to sit through that to get to Cold Desert, it's well worth the wait. In the end, these guys are modern Southern rockers that aren't afraid to embrace every other style of rock, or at least English rock, worth emulating. Will they eventually evolve into awholly original sound, saving for the fact that Caleb Followill's vocals couldn't be any more singular?  Maybe not, but few bands ever do.
B000BTGY1O|3.0|Blow away the froth from the top of this movie, and what do you have?  Just more froth and more froth.  The one saving grace is Audrey Hepburn.  She simply looks great.    Hepburn's character in the movie is little more than a high class prostitute.  She is willing to sell herself to the highest bidder.  George Peppard's character is nothing more than a male prostitute who lives comfortably on the donations of a rich woman played by Patricia Neal.  Mickey Rooney is embarrassing as a Japanese neighbor, complete with thick glasses and buck teeth.    Well, it doesn't take a genius to predict that Hepburn and Peppard will give up their sinful ways, with an ending as sweetly sentimental as the tune that won the Academy Award, \\"Moon River.\\"    Realistic, the movie isn't.  It's a sort of urban fairy tale, and in that it is somewhat successful--that and Audrey Hepburn's charm.
B000063UR2|4.0|Hello,<br />Just recieved and reviewed these two version's of \\"Legend\\", I owned the U.S.<br />version on VHS for sometime. And shared with friend's. So now I finally saw the director's cut. And for me and a couple friends this cut didn't really add anything to the story and Jerry Goldsmith's music doesn't enhance the story.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Across the Universe is a colorful and turblent tale of love and war in the late 1960s. Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess play Lucy and Jude who fall in love during the midst of the Vietnam War. This is a musical and all the songs are Beatles classics like Strawberry Fields Forever, If I Fell, Happiness Is a Warm Gun, I Am the Walrus, I've Just Seen A Face, and many many more. The acting and singing is superb and the plot works perfectly with the Beatles fun and moving lyrics. Look for cameos by Bono, Joe Cocker, and Salma Hayek. My favorite music number is I Want You (She's So Heavy) featuring a great new face Joe Anderson. I highly recommend this tripped-out, hippie love gem, enjoy!!

0316066524|5.0|For all of my life I've been a voracious reader; yet very few books gave me as much pleasure as \\"Infinite Jest\\". A savage satire on our way of life, yet truly funny and immensely readable, with a character of its very own.   I am certain that in a hundred years' time, it will rank as equal to Tom Jones, Tristram Shandy and Gulliver's Travels as a true classic. A rare pleasure I would recommend to all.
031606792X|4.0|I just read some of the negative reviews for Breaking Dawn and my first reaction was disbelief that the story was taken so seriously and not enjoyed for its fantastic twists, because thats just what this book is, a fantasy! Yes the ending was a very happy one and yes it all fit together too perfectly, but life is too real and stressful to want this story to be more realistic. I AM teenager and starting my second year as a premed student, and I dont think that this book can sway a reader to abandon education and marry young unless the reader had already decided to do so. I dont believe any girl my age is so impressionable as to change her life's course because this book painted pretty picture of marriage and children. These are values that are either there or they're not, and this book is not going to change that.    I lost sleep reading this book when I should have been studying, and I don't regret it! It was very enjoyable and I loved the way the characters were developed, and Renesmee was a very nice, very shocking, addition. I hope we get to see how her future with Jacob plays  out! I recommend it to all fantasy/romance readers who enjoy a happy ending.
0765316897|5.0|This was a great story in which i thoroughly enjoyed the ending.  I felt like the loose endings were tied up, while possibly leaving room for more books set in the same world.

And on an aside if this is the way Mr. Sanderson rights, i can't WAIT for a Memory of Light!

0684833395|5.0|The amazing CATCH-22 essentially has three overlapping narratives. One shows senior officers who are comically unsympathetic to the interests of their men. Some of these, such as Colonel Cathcart and General Peckem, are careerists who make decisions according to self-interest (or stupidity and self-interest). Others are incompetents, such as Major Major Major Major and General Sheiskopff, whose authority far surpasses their ability. To me, the careerist officers, while satirical, seemed as real as any modern bungling boss, working smugly in the corner office.<br /><br />Milo Minderbinder, a genius trader and capitalist, is the dominant character in the second narrative. Technically, Milo is the mess officer at Pianosa, where Yossarian is based. But he has parlayed this job into a food supply syndicate and has become a major commercial player throughout the entire war zone. Milo is a profiteer and entrepreneur whose greed distorts, and sometimes overshadows, the war.<br /><br />With Milo, Heller shows a world of surrealistic capitalism that thrives as the men in the bombers die. But for me, Milo didn't add much. His adventures make twisted sense. Yet they hit only one note and don't really ripen into something more profound.  Milo is the least successful part of this superior and complex book.<br /><br />The third narrative in CATCH-22 shows the men who fly in the bombers. Here, Heller's work is outstanding. There are men who can't shake the presence of death (Yossarian, Dunbar, Hungry Joe, and Dobbs). There are true believers who accept the mission and its risks (Clevinger and Havermeyer). There is a rich kid (Nately), a reckless hotdog (McWatt), and a doomed alcoholic (Chief White Halfoat). And there are the horrible fatalities (Snowden and Kid Sampson), whose deaths are gruesome and arbitrary.<br /><br />Heller's work with these characters is absolutely first-rate. While they have cartoonish aspects, each is distinct and each has a surprisingly moving story. Heller also writes about their combat missions with you-are-there intensity. Finally, he connects the reader emotionally to the plight of these characters, especially in the final 150 pages, when the power and poignance of his narratives merge and really hit home. Then, you feel the consequences when you learn that, say, Milo has substituted aspirin for morphine in McWatt's plane on the tragic and high-risk mission to Avignon. \\"There there,\\" murmurs Yossarian. \\"There there.\\"<br /><br />CATCH-22 is a long book. There is repetitiveness in its humor. Its iteration of events is occasionally maddening. But keep at it!

B000UJ48V8|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is one of the best, and most powerful war films of all time.    If you don't \\"get it\\", read the novel it was based on:  \\"The Short-Timers\\", by Gustav Hasford.    If you've read the book, you'll understand the way the movie seems to \\"jump\\" from one setting to the next, mentioned in other reviews here.    Short-Timers consists of three acts, \\"The Spirit of the Bayonet\\", \\"Body Count\\", and \\"Grunts.\\" The first act is fairly accurately reproduced in the movie, but the second and third acts are combined, and the film loses some plot clarity as a result. In the book, you'll notice that the narative style begins in a simple, direct, and at times brutal manner, and becomes more introspective as the plot moves into the second and third parts ... while the main character, initially a passive observer, becomes increasingly involved. The movie reproduces this narative, enhanced by the imagery that is trademark Kubrick. You will be immersed in this film.    I'm by no means suggesting the ol' \\"the book was better\\" here ... this is a terrific film, and it stands on its own merits. However, for those who found the plot confusing ... read the book, you'll better understand the imagery of the film, the transformation of the central character, and why the film ends the way that it does. I can't help but wonder what this film might have looked like had Kubrick maintained the \\"three act\\" format of the book ...    Buy the film, you won't be disappointed. Buy Hasford's book as well, and you'll be back watching the film again several times over.

B001DHXT2A|2.0|I AM A DIEHARD FAN OF THE HULK DESPITE THE TWO STAR RATING.  I REALLY WANT HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE A KILLER HULK MOVIE WHICH I COULD WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  HOWEVER,I ASK MYSELF WHY IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIM LOOK REAL (ORGANIC) ON THE SCREEN?  THE MAKERS OF THE FILM, ON THE BONUS FEATURES, BRAG ABOUT THE CGI USED, HOWEVER, THE HULK STILL LOOKS LIKE A CARTOON.  THE FILM IS STILL BETTER THAN THE FIRST.  WHICH ISN'T SAYING MUCH.  A LITTLE SLOW MOVING AT TIMES.  I TAKE THAT BACK, VERY BORING AT TIMES.  AT BEST, WORTH A ONE TIME VIEWING AT A CHEAP PRICE (RENT IT).  HOWEVER, I STILL CAN'T GET OVER HOW MONSTERS IN A MOVIE LIKE JURASSIC PARK, WHICH WAS MADE BACK IN 1993, LOOK REAL AND ORGANIC ON THE SCREEN.  AND YET, THIS IS 2008, AND CGI, AT TIMES, SEEMS TO LOOK PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AND THROWN TOGETHER.  MAYBE, SPIELBURG SHOULD MAKE THE NEXT HULK MOVIE.  AFTER ALL, A GREAT COMIC CHARACTER DESERVES A BETTER DIRECTOR, STORY, AND SPECIAL EFFECTS.  THEN AGAIN, HOLLYWOOD CAN'T MAKE ANY ORIGINAL MOVIES ANYMORE.  SINCE HOLLYWOOD LIKES TO DO REMAKES, MAYBE THEY CAN GET IT RIGHT THE THIRD TIME.  UNLESS YOU LIKE A PREDICTABLE PLOT, CARTOONS THROWN RANDOMLY IN A MOVIE, BAD ACTING (DESPITE HAVING GOOD ACTORS--LIV TYLER DOESN'T COUNT), AND BAD DIRECTING (WHO THE HELL IS LOUIS LETTERRIER), STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM.  BUT I GUESS WHEN THE VIEWING PUBLIC HAS TO SETTLE WITH CRAPPY REALITY TV AND BAD MOVIE REMAKES, MOST PEOPLE WILL LOWER THEIR STANDARDS AND CALL THIS A GOOD MOVIE.  BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.  I IMAGINE THE VIEWING PUBLIC JUST WANTS A GOOD HULK MOVIE.  I JUST WANT MY $24.00 BACK.
0743455967|4.0|I'm not even a fan of Stephen King.  I've seen plenty<br />of movies made from his books and most of them were<br />bad or stupid or both.<br /><br />I have read a handful of fiction books  the guy wrote.<br />He's easy to read - he hashes out these very human<br />characters well and puts them in these unusual, frightening<br />situations - often no-wins.  You probably know that.<br /><br />It's easy to overlook that King, the champion schlockmeister,<br />is a consumate communicator.  His writing is empathic - which<br />is what keeps us curious and involved in the stories.<br /><br />Honestly - I don't like slasher movies.  Maybe King doesn't<br />write them but in my little brain he is inextricably tied<br />to the genre that scared the pants off me as a kid -<br />Friday the 13th, et. al.<br /><br />The funny thing is that King's fiction is surprisingly<br />complex, rich in character and local color.  When<br />put on the screen it is generally dull and seems formulaic -<br />but that is perhaps more because King's writing has<br />influenced all scary movies of the last 30 years.<br /><br />I'm an admirer now.  I'm taking writing a lot more seriously<br />now than I have in the last 15 years.  I still think<br />the themes and plots of many of King's novels don't<br />interest me - but after reading this there are a half-dozen<br />or so I may track-down and read.... particularly:<br /><br />-The Stand<br />-The Tommyknocker's (apparently derivative of 5 Million Years To Earth - which<br />is close to the best Sci-fi film ever, IMO, and ripped-off also in the Space<br />Vampires movie \\"LifeForce\\")<br /><br />Oh yeah.  The writing stuff.  Cogent.  To the point.  How<br />to simplify and amplify the power of your story.

1591840562|5.0|My first start-up has taken me over a year to get off the ground. It's a huge and ambitious project and has put my entrepreneurial skills to a test. I truly believe in learning from others so I'm a member of virtually every entrepreneurial blog, magazine and forum. I have also purchased about 8 different books on the subject, all varying in context slightly. The problem with this is that the time spent on blogs, magazines, forums and books is time you can very well spend actually building your company.    If the Art of the Start would have been the first book I bought, I would have saved a lot of time. All the answers I had looked for previously were in there, and they were all explained in that typical Kawasaki way; to the point and no B.S.    This book is by far one of the best pieces of literature on the entrepreneurial start-up process I have yet to get my hands on. If you are planning to start a company, NGO or just a project within your already existing organization, I recommend you read this book FIRST. There will surely be other books that will guide you or help you with the specific details of the area you are working on but try to start out by getting the basic \\"how to...\\" of a start-up out of this book.
B001CLG6RC|4.0|I think a lot of people are dissapointed because this album is a little different then Enigma's previous albums.  That doesn't make it bad, it is just a little different.  I was a bit scared when buying this album because I didn't know if I would like it or not.  But after listening to it a few times, I think it is really good.  Yes, there are a couple of tracks that aren't that great, but that is ok.  I didn't like every song on all of Enigma's other albums either.  You can listen to some of the songs on youtube first if you want an idea of what you are getting.  What puzzles me, is that other reviewers say that this album is too much hip hop like and one of their favorite songs is Seven Lives; but that song is the most hip hop of them all!  It has some beat box type singing and rhythms, which is different but sounds ok and overall the song is really good.  I would say overall, this album is not as emotional or sexual as some of Enigma's past work.  It is still a great buy and will be enjoyable for most Enigma fans (listen with an open mind!).  I got this album at Walmart for $13.99 (the 2 cd set), they also sell the 1 cd album for $11.99.. way cheaper then Amazon which is surprising.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|I can't get enough of SATC and I was totally one of those girls first in line when the movie came out.  After seeing the movie I was just as excited to get the DVD for all the bonus features!  But can you believe there were only four deleted scenes?!  Four?!  Oh well, I haven't watched the movie with the commentary \\"on\\" yet, but I'm sure that will give tons of good behind-the-scenes info.  Enjoy SATC fans!
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele is the newest female British singer.  It seems like every month this year the new big thing has come from the UK.  Adele has a great voice with solid lyrics.  Unfortunatly she is competing in the same market as Joss Stone, Amy Winehouse, Lilly Allen, Kate Nash just to name a few.  The field is crowded and I think that she is one star behind Amy Winehouse.  If are a fan of the new soul movement you will enjoy Adele.

0446579939|4.0|I received this book yesterday and just finished reading it this morning. It really was a very sweet story with believable characters. I liked how the author weaved the story between the three main characters. The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because while I really did enjoy the book, it is not my favorite of all of Nicholas Sparks' books. And I have read every book he has written, with the exception of Three Weeks with my Brother. I recommend this book.
0375826726|5.0|I have allready read the first two books.  So be sure to have read those before you read this, as it's part 3 of a 4 part cycle.<br /><br />I think the writing is excelent how you are drawn into the world and it makes you feel as if you are in the book. That is why I read books, to enjoy and relax.  This book does it for me.  As did the first two.

B0013K0R2M|5.0|This album is what my old friend Barney would call \\"SUPER-DEE-DUPER\\". But seriously, it's really great metal that's hard for other bands to try to mimic. One of my favorite albums to date with my favorites being: All These Things I Hate, Tears Don't Fall, 4 Words, Room 409, and The Poison.  Every metal lover needs to pick this one up for sure.
0143038419|3.0|My book group (a thoughtful bunch of people) decided not to read this book because, as one member said, \\"It's self-centered and trivial.\\" So I read it on my own.    Perhaps Liz Gilbert IS being self-centered as she makes her very personal journey through limited parts of Italy, India and Bali. If that offends you, by all means skip Eat, Pray, Love. On the other hand, her adventures, perceptions and, most of all, joys, are contagious and at times delicious. I tired of her search for God, perhaps because I don't care to look myself. But her experiences with personal revelation and, just as important, characters, food and culture, are a lot of fun.    I suggest you read it with a light heart - it's okay to be self-indulgent once in a while, and Liz Gilbert admits several times that she knows she's got it good and is lucky to have this year of self-discovery.    I was in no hurry to finish this book, because it was a simple pleasure.

B000007UXS|4.0|five-star album; fewer-star pressing.    this album is perhaps the best introduction to radiohead for the uninitiated, but what's the deal with capitol's reissue having label-placement issues?  i purchased two copies of this LP and on both copies the label on side two is placed such that i have to be poised and ready to lift the needle after street spirit fades out so that it doesn't get sucked onto the paper label making an AWFUL noise and clearly damaging my needle.  my new, reissued copy of Kid A has a similar problem (end of side 2 and 4 make awful noise, but don't get sucked all the way on to the paper label).  what's the point of going through the trouble of reissuing such an incredible album without seeing the quality-control through to the very end?  this item would have most definitely received a five-star rating were it not for this problem.
0790733226|1.0|Contact is avowed atheist Carl Sagan's glorious swan song, a brilliant treatment of the hypocrisy of religion and establishment. Jodie Foster is characteristically excellent as Dr. Ellie Arroway, the gifted astronomer whose discovery of an alien beacon sets off a frenzy for control of how the discovery should be handled.  Dr. Arroway is slapped down at every turn by those who do not appreciate her independent thinking. Her dilemma reflects the logical fallacy at the heart of all religion. When she will not accept on faith the \\"truths\\" imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.  Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests.  Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.  Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious.  Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on.

The image of this bluray is a miracle (Forget the old DVD). A total successfull!!! Pour mes amis les français : ce blu ray est une bombe, l'image est superbe (oubliez le vieux DVD avec son image horrible) et la vraie VF est présente. En plus vu son prix c'est une véritable affaire pour ce dernier bon film de Schwarzenegger (avant les calamiteux LA FIN DES TEMPS et DOMMAGE COLLATERAL par exemple). Un achat sur et de qualité!!! Foncez!!!

B00018TI5E|5.0|I've had this CD for some time now, and it is one of the few albums I could listen to several times throughout the day without tiring of it. Every single song is amazing and stands as a testament to John Frusciante's truly unique musical talent. I, of course, bought the album as a Chili Peppers fan, but quickly became an even stronger John Frusciante fan. From one of the greatest bands of all time, comes one of the greatest musicians of all time. The songs mesh and flow perfectly even though each song provides a stunning originality that not only help to distinguish one sound from the other but separate them altogether from any other music I've ever heard.

B000QFAG6W|5.0|The album is very good, but I must commend Amazon for their promptness in delivering the record to me. They made it so easy to order the record, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness that it arrived at my door. I have ordered vinyl albums from several internet sites, since my area no longer carries them, and Amazon has been the best so far. I wish others could follow your example of quick delivery and simple method of ordering. I hope to do more ordering of vinyl LPs from Amazon in the future.
1401200605|5.0|I have been a big fan of the superhero genre for years, but oddly enough I have not been a fan of comic books. Until now.     In recent years I have been enthralled with both DC and Marvel characters that I have been introduced to via blockbuster films. Indeed, the summer of 2008 will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best (if not the best) superhero film runs ever. If you weren't blown away by the killer line up of Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and The Dark Knight then you obviously have no pulse. Somewhere amidst this trifecta of movie bliss, my curiosity about comics began to grow.     Batman has always been a character that I have loved in films and TV shows and Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have successfully solidified my status as a Batman fan. Batman: Hush was highly recommended to me as a great starting point into Batman comics and while my expectations were high, I was still blown away by what I discovered.     Batman: Hush is absolutely everything I could have hoped for in my first real foray into comic books. Jeph Loeb presents us with a story that is gripping at every turn and chocked full of surprises. Batman has long been a fan favorite because he isn't a traditional superhero. Having no super powers or abilities, Batman has always fed on the darkness of his childhood to instill fear into the criminals who prey on the innocent. Using his own darkness Batman longs to bring light to the world making him one of the most complex and endearing characters in literature today. Loeb gives us all of these qualities in perfect doses throughout.     This first volume gives us some memorable interaction between Batman and several famous characters that will leave readers giddy with excitement. The scenes between Batman and Catwoman are especially telling, but nothing compared to the \\"showdown\\" between The Caped Crusader and The Man of Steel. I never thought I would actually hold my breath while reading a comic book.      Batman: Hush actually worksas a fantastic mystery story full of twists and turns. Each piece of the puzzle gives us more questions ensuring that we will hold on tight for the ride. Batman's often underused detective skills are on full display here, giving us yet another fresh look at this phenomenal character.     Jim Lee's art throughout is breathtaking to say the least. Epic full page spreads and flowing panels effortlessly carry along Loeb's incredible storytelling. The aforementioned battle between DC's heavyweights is drawn to such perfection that you actually forget you are reading a comic book. Lee also gives us some beautiful flashback panels that really sell this fitting storytelling device.     Batman: Hush is a must read for all fans of Batman or for anyone wanting a truly exhilarating comic book experience. Even if you aren't familiar with Batman and his truly impressive Rogues Gallery, you will still enjoy the engaging story and relentless pacing of this classic first volume.     I wasn't a fan of comic books! What was I thinking???
B001FBSMW6|1.0|Keane went from mature, thoughtful pop artists to some sort of N-Sync / way-over-synthesized, \\"Oooo-Wah-Ooo,\\" crappy electronica group.  Not, not, not a move in a good direction.  Really - what were they thinking?  This will lose the old fans, and gain no new ones.  Bummer.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Second half mediocre. But any AC/DC is good to have. Brian's can get on your nerves after about 8 songs, but what would they be without him. I thought Angus could have got a little more creative on some solos, but other than that, get the deluxe version so you know what Brian is saying, which isn't much. Ha Ha.
B000089RV6|4.0|This is the Quintessential AC/DC album. Anyone who has heard an AC/DC song has probably heard one of the many hits from this album. I haven't gone to a wedding or Company Xmas party(with a DJ) where I haven't heard at least \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\"!
B001G5IJVK|1.0|look at the track selection. do we have these songs already? didn't kiss release a box set? why are they constantly trying to grab every single penny out of all kiss fans? any true fan will avoid at all costs.not even a rare track worth buying. pass.

B000ZINGIK|4.0|What an interesting album. And I mean that in a good way. Many different voices on this album (including Alice Cooper). The song styles are also a wide range of sounds (and I'm guessing talents). A good solid album.
0307383415|4.0|Good Book. It is clearly well written by a very intelligent and introspective person.     Pretty much required reading for anyone who wants insight into the life of the first Black President of the USA ..... (soon to be...)    Especially as it helps to explain his unique odyssey from Hawaii to Indonesia, Chicago and Africa.     The parts about Kenya were, for me, the best and most touching and interesting parts of the book; as they come at the end, it's worth reading this book all the way through,     Can't wait to see his White House memoirs...........(..?).....
B000024MKV|4.0|A great greatest hits album. My first Gotthard album, and I was not disappointed! A little bit of everything.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|\\"Perfect Symmetry\\" completes Keane's dazzling transformation into an entrancing electro-disco rock band.<br /><br />Keane must have gotten tired of critics calling them Coldplay clones, because this album overflows with snazzy synthesizer squeeks and beeps. It's a fantastic change of pace for Keane. The opening track begins with Tim Rice-Oxley playing an awesome squealing synthesizer noise before Tom Chaplin sings in his best tenor voice. He sings lyrics about the pitfalls of fame, singing \\"I made you in the image of myself/I gave you everything you wanted/So you would never know anything else/But every time I reach for you, you slip through my fingers.\\"<br /><br />Keane is also taking making stabs at Coldplay for flaunting their celebrity image, especially in the song \\"Better Than This.\\" After some Rice-Oxley plays some crazy wah-wah sounds in the background, Chaplin sings \\"Get a grip on yourself/Could have been something but you're too late/And you weren't invited anyway.\\" Chaplin clearly doesn't care much for celebrity fanfare and prefers to play better music instead.<br /><br />While it is possible that Keane is somewhat jealous of Coldplay for all their fame and fanfare, what matters is the music. And Rice-Oxley has awesome machine beeps and synthesizers buzzes throughout the entire album. While Keane hasn't declared this as an 80s album, Chaplin has acknowledged that this is a good tribute to the bolder, more energetic groups of the 80s, such as the Pet Shop Boys and Salt n Pepa.<br /><br />Probably the only downer is the last song on the album, which is a weird jazz song that sounds out-of-place in this collection of disco inferno-styled tunes. Chaplin sings like an over-sentimental James Blunt, and the song lacks the cool sci-fi sounds the rest of the album.<br /><br />However, this is still a solid collection from an English band that reinvented themselves successfully.
0375826726|5.0|An excellent continuation of a great series. Exploration of Eragon's origins and some great revalations coupled with nice pacing, super character development, and vivid descriptions make this an enjoyable read.  Christopher Paolini just keeps getting better.
0875428940|5.0|The Robin Wood tarot deck is beautifully drawn.  The colors are vibrant without being overwhelming.  I have numerous tarot decks, but I've been looking for that \\"one\\" deck to which I really felt connected.  The Robin Wood Tarot is that deck.  I've used the Rider Waite deck, one of the most traditional decks, but it always left me with an odd ominous feeling.  I don't get that with the Robin Wood tarot.  If anything, I'm left with a feeling of calm good will.  It leaves me feeling very connected to the Earth in a positive way.
159562015X|3.0|This book was interesting. It told me what my strengths were. Ironic because they are exactly what others point out to be my faults: focused-read tunnel vision, deliberative- read over analyzing...etc. Good insights, also shows you how to positively view your \\"strengths\\" that others may not value as strongly. Its nice to see how I am supposed to fit in groups. I give this a solid 3 stars because I was pretty unimpressed with the website. If you can find the old version used or something, I think it would probably work the same, for cheaper.
B000001ZS8|4.0|Yep, IMHO this is always the Jarre album that I go to when I want something fun, whimsical and light hearted. I've no idea what he was drinking at the time he made this but it was working for him. Given the number of reviews already posted for this album I'll just add a few quick points about this disc and hope they help out the prospective buyer.<br /><br />Firstly, the aforementioned light hearted nature of the release. Not that Jarre was ever some sort of gothic doom electronica kind of guy, but here the lightness of being is most assertive, a whole range of quick rhythms keeping this albums tracks sprightly and festive.<br /><br />Secondly there is still enough introspective segments and still enough of that haunting Jarre trademark to provide counterpoints to all the shafts of light. This is particularly welcome in such instrumental music as it helps with the pacing and enables the album to be listened to in one sitting and digested by the listener as a comprehensible whole.<br /><br />Lastly, as you'd expect the sound is good, there is space in the arrangements. Thankfully not every nook and cranny has been filled with sound (don't you just hate recordings killed by too much compression?).<br /><br />A very worthwhile Jarre release.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I remember watching this on PBS with my Mom when I was a kid, and just loving it.  so I bought it for my 6 and 8 year old to enjoy.  They love the \\"Moses Supposes\\" song and \\"tap dance\\" all over the living room when it's on.  When the kids start to argue with each other, I simply break into the song and they start singing along (and stop bickering).  It's Great!
B00004STPT|2.0|Well played, well thought out and in posession of a number of moods this companion soundtrack to the blockbuster sand and sandal epic should be a good buy.  Coming out early enough in the piece to avoid most of the audio compression problems so inherent with much mid 00's product it sees Hollywood film music legend Hans Zimmer collaborate with Lisa Gerrard (who was unfamiliar to me prior to this) and this first disc - there is another of further music - runs the gamut of the film's stages from beginning to end. And it must of sold some copies for them to have bothered to cobble together another `from or inspired by' disc at a later date.<br /><br />The drama for me here is the lack of drama. For a film that had a number of moods but predominantly action and resigned pride and sadness, there is startlingly little bollocks to the music. The Battle (track 3) is at least lively but it fails to elicit any emotional response in the listener. There are passages that have some fire but even then it seems to be muted as if the composers were strangely gunshy. It certainly didn't inspire me to hit my play button too many times nor did it inspire me to throw the movie on.<br /><br />I suppose the situation could best be summed up by the fact that when this movie came out and they needed some stirring music for the trailer they chose `Anvil of Crom' written by Basil Poledouris and used in the old film Conan The Barbarian. Not a good sign! There is some value here and I have a great deal of respect for Hans Zimmer but this is a fumble, without the movie to prop it up these sounds don't translate well.
B00009Y3L4|3.0|The quality of the DVD was fine. I didn't care much for the movie though.
B000089J0R|3.0|Nine songs that largely sound the same, the problems with Dragonforce (at least up until Ultrabeatdown) have been well documented but heck, this is the debut so it's pretty easy to forgive them. The manic double time delivery reminds me of much Euro product and certainly the power metal bands of Europe from the late 90's and early 00's had inspired these boys. For example think Stratovarius' double time obsession but with more heft due to more mid range and bottom end noise being utilised for a less prissy and more ballsy end product. The screeching and soaring guitar solos are in place even at this early stage, let's face it they are really what this band is based around. ZP Thearts' vocals are good, they fit the bands genre perfectly and he has gotten stronger over the years, really stamping his authority on proceedings come Inhuman Rampage though here he's mixed a bit far back.<br /><br />The production isn't too bad given the presumably limited budget and big ups to the band for being so involved in aspects of the project such as recording, mixing etc. The effort that went into this thing does somewhat prove that while they may act like it's all a joke they work hard, which was already obvious from the musicianship of the two guitarists. Nobody gets that speedy without hours and hours of practice. Daily.<br /><br />If you're still not sure if you want to sink your teeth into this aural assault, I'd recommend listening to samples of Disciples of Babylon or Heart of a Dragon. Oh, and if your still not 100% sure what this band probably sound like, the first track is an instrumental called Invocation of Apocalyptic Evil. There, that should set you right
B000E41MS6|5.0|I absolutely love Doctor Who. I think the acting is phenomenal and the stories always get more creative every episode. I think Christopher Eccelston was a funny yet passionate Doctor. I love the character of Rose Tyler portrayed by Billie Piper. She is and always will be my favorite character on the show. I love the way Rose and the Doctor's relationship grew throughout the season and how much they grow to love each other. They are probably my favorite couple EVER. I live in Hawaii so I would always watch Doctor Who on the computer. It was so awesome to be able to see it on my TV. I can't wait to get the second season as that is my favorite. But I strongly recommend you get this box set if you live in the States since it doesn't normally air here. Or if you're just an all around die hard Doctor Who fan. I bought it for both reasons :)
B000001ZSF|4.0|My very first impressions upon listening to this disc were that after the brilliance of Revolutions Jarre had shot his bolt and had sort of reverted to type. By that I mean not only the music but right down to the details, such as naming the eight tracks here Chronologie part 1 through to part 8.<br /><br />But that's an oversimplification. Jarre has here gone backwards somewhat, yes, but in a way that will probably please all those that found Revolutions too commercial, too communicative - what with it's almost standard song lengths and concepts around what each track was based.<br /><br />In terms of direction there is none here - this is the electronica version of late 70's prog rock gone mad. And let's face it, someone has to do it so it might as well be Jarre! As the tracks meander to through their various peaks and valleys it becomes obvious that the whole thing hangs together as one piece of music very well. The ability to blend the eight tracks into one comprehensible whole is quite inspiring though personally I've found this disc to be a little samey and after an initial burst have gone, at times, years without playing it as I far prefer his earlier work. It almost seems to lack the fragility that marked passages of his earlier stuff. But this is still a quality release and fans should pick themselves up a copy even if it's not his very best work.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|WOW!!!  Talk about flirting with disaster!!  So, clearly I'm not an Argento-phile.  The pig I alluded to would be the film \\"Suspiria\\".  The lipstick is Dario Argento's visual style.  What I ended up with was a very visually appealing film that could have been 20 minutes long and still not have been nearly as interesting as the hype.  I can clearly hear your cries of protest and disbelief; \\"YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MORON!!!  Believe me, I've been here before.  I'm use to it.  You would present as evidence of my suspect intelligence, approval of films like \\"Hatchet\\" and \\"Slugs\\".  Yet, I have watched this movie twice and a half and have recently watched four other Argento \\"classics\\", some of which I enjoyed to a certain degree.  So armed, I will endeavor to explain why this film didn't do it for me on a complete level (yea, this is serious stuff!!!).<br /><br />-THE PROVERBIAL PIG.<br />Of course, the \\"pig\\" in \\"Suspiria\\" is the story.  Everybody who loves this film, including the amazon.com reviewer up there, willfully dismisses the admittedly convoluted story as extraneous to the brilliance of this film.  I guess I'm screwy because I think that idea is just appalling.  Let me qualify this by saying that I am a professional artist.  I have knowledge of most of the visual arts including photography.  I'm a visual person by nature.  Yet, the visual experience in \\"Suspiria\\" was not enough for me to give the bloated and shallow story a free pass.  I understand surrealism and the attempt at a nightmarish atmosphere.  Though visually achieving these goals, the story was not given nearly the same attention to detail and thus suffered. Since my first Argento film (Tenebre) my opinion of Argento's story telling has been that he's \\"clumsy\\".After watching several other Argento films, that opinion has been greatly reinforced.  Not surprisingly, I felt the story could not match the drama of the visual experience.  My bad for expecting the Director to at least find a way to keep things moving.  The result is that I spent a lot of time waiting for something to happen... ...ANYTHING!<br /><br />-THE LIPSTICK.<br />There is just too much to say about the visual nature of this film.  Given the time it was made, it is slightly rough around the edges yet visually alluring.  From what I can tell, Argento basically invented the now clich&eacute; use of red and blue lighting to elicit a creepy feel.  Heck, I use that same lighting on my Halloween displays at home to great effect.  However, the images in \\"Suspiria\\" are more than just lighting tricks.  He clearly intended to use the primary colors with a few tertiary colors as a palate for everything in this film.  This would include bold paint schemes for the architecture.  Speaking of architecture, as an artist, I love the building locations Argento chooses for his films.  So many classic styles are on display. I almost felt I was watching a documentary on early 20th century design styles. I particularly enjoyed the Art Nouveau interiors of the dance school.  Add this to Argento's love for the creative shot and you have visual heaven.  My favorite shot in this film puts all the elements together as we look through a light bulb; beautiful.  Clearly I enjoyed the visual experience of \\"Suspiria\\".  To deny that would just be... ...pigheaded.<br /><br />-LIPSTICK PART II<br />I'm not sure how many people realize this, and it might be a key to why so many are wowed by \\"Suspiria\\" on a visual level, but this film was the very last film ever to use the \\"Technicolor\\" dye transfer process.  This highly stable process insures long term quality of color and a highly saturated color palate. Given these two advantages, this DVD and the film in general, have eye popping colors on top of the bold palate Argento employed.  Though Technicolor was not as realistic a depiction of color as other film, it actually added to the surreal quality of the visuals in \\"Suspiria\\".<br /><br />-ONE OF MY FAVORITE MUSICSCORES.<br />See, I'm not a total loser!  I thought this music was incredible and on the cutting edge of where music was going at the time.  There are two main themes that get played over and over again, and I have to admit, I kept anticipating them eagerly.  Since this film was made when I started High School, I was much more into the music trends of the day.  This music greatly anticipates the \\"New Wave\\" African rhythm trends of the late 70s and early 1980s that Peter Gabriel so fervently promoted.  I happen to be an old Gabriel fan so this sat well with me.  The music is simultaneously very intense and sublime while heightening a sense of dread and anticipation.  The problem occurs when not much usually happens in the story to accompany the music.<br /><br />-SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH PIGS!?<br />I have no problem with pigs in general, even when used as a metaphor for a screenplay.  Heck, I love \\"Evil Dead II\\" and that has the loosest of story threads bordering on nonexistent.  But I love evil dead because it's off the wall and wildly entertaining.  I'd kiss that pig any day.  My troubles with the \\"Suspiria\\" story are lack of dynamic or interesting developments.  Now here is where many put up the red flag and say \\"you miss the point\\".  Of course I would argue that I didn't.  I've heard explanations of Suspiria's story that go kind of like this:<br /><br />\\"...things happen which don't always make sense or get explained, and things move slowly.  But this adds to the surreal, nightmarish experience of \\"Suspiria\\".\\"<br /><br />I agree with two of those points.  As far as the nightmarish experience, I'm not feeling it.  Oh, visually and musically this film has \\"creepy\\" and \\"nightmarish\\" written all over it.  However, more often than not, there is nothing going on in the story to make me feel that way.  Often, defense of the bloated story sounds like excuses to me.  This is a story that could be told around a campfire in 20 minutes.  I don't mean to oversell my dissatisfaction with this film.  I didn't hate it.  But when the most brutal and frightening moment in the film occurs in the first 15 minutes, everything else is a bit of a letdown.  Ultimately, it was the lack of fear or dread compounded by overwrought attention to mundane action that bored me with \\"Suspiria\\".<br /><br />-FLAP, FLAP, SCREAM, WAVE, FLAP, FLAP...<br />To further the lack of scariness, a few very silly and unintentionally funny scenes appear in \\"Suspiria\\".  One involves what might be the worst fake dog head ever.  Other things about that scene are funny too, but I've said enough.  The other is a scene with a bat that highlights why this film lacked the proper ingredients for me to bestow greatness upon it.  In this scene, a character is attacked by a little, fat, motorized bat.  Now, this sounds funny enough, but there is more.  Said bat attacks for what seems like 5 minutes.  All the while, his victim waives arms and screams with little conviction while standing in one spot.  Finally, the bat flies off into the corner and apparently tries to flush the toilet.  I'm kind of joking because I'm not sure what the little bugger was doing.  Finally he decides to attack from the ground; \\"hump, hump, hump\\", he thumps towards the still stationary victim.  It ends quite beautifully but I won't elaborate.  Unfortunately, I laughed very hard at this stuff.  Immediately after this diabolical bat attack, the mood of the film was completely moot to me.  Nothing happens after that to make up for a complete lack of dread or fear on my part.  It just wasn't good enough.<br /><br />-IT'S SCARY BEING ME.<br />Sorry Argento-philes; the story here is just too uneventful for me to bestow greatness on \\"Suspiria\\".  The film does a lot of things in a great way but the overall story lacked the required substance to keep me on edge.  Not even the glorious visuals in Technicolor combined with one of the best soundtracks ever in a horror film could make me sit on the edge of my seat or scare me for that matter.  I will admit that the second viewing was better than the first, so thank goodness I deferred reviewing after one look.  However, the enhanced enjoyment wasn't because the film got better in my eyes; it was because I knew to pay more attention to the visual and musical aspects than to invest effort into the story.  Yet, all the coolness of image and sound could not overcome the hype of how scary this movie is supposed to be.  A little bit edgy?  Okay.  But without a flowing, eventful, scary story, this film will always be incomplete to me.<br /><br />Visuals....5 Stars<br />Music......5 Stars<br />Acting.....3.5 Stars<br />Story......2 Stars<br /><br />Average....3.88 Starsng moment in the film occurs in the first 15 minutes, everything else is a bit of a letdown.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|We bought the UK version (which is region free) and it looks very good.  Exterior footage looks fantastic and interior footage is definitely better than the DVD release.  The DTS Audio is also excellent.  P&P has never looked or sounded better.    Here is some info on this release:     \\"Returning to the original 16mm film negatives this classic drama has been painstakingly restored frame-by-frame.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Saw this series originally on HBO and have used it in my classroom to give the kids a better idea of how things went before the revolution. The kids liked it and it was informative.    Also used the subtitles that tells information about daily customs during the time period.

0321525655|4.0|Long before there was PowerPoint, most presentations contained more columns of numbers and bullet points than pictures. PowerPoint seemed designed to capture the essence of those transparencies and make it faster to create them . . . while adding color. Compared to those ugly transparencies, PowerPoint seemed like an improvement.<br /><br />By comparison, my dentist has always covered his walls with beautiful bleed images of gorgeous places combined with intriguing sayings about life. Those posters are the only uplifting thing about my trips to the dentist's office. He doesn't tell me any entertaining stories.<br /><br />In presentationzen, Garr Reynolds shares with us that today's audiences like a standard PowerPoint presentation about as much as I like going to the dentist (I doubt if you are surprised by that). His prescription is to turn the typical presentation into a series of stories aided by exhibits that remind me of those dental posters while being very responsive (present . . . in his terminology) to the audience.<br /><br />The book's main strength, and one that makes it well worth reading and following, is in describing a process that can be used to create a presentation that will be compelling. Even when I see a presentation that I like, I don't learn much from the example because the presenter doesn't share the process behind the result.<br /><br />The examples almost all showed someone in a black turtle neck, black pants, and black shoes who looked like a Steve Jobs acolyte. As a result, there's an Apple versus Microsoft tone to the book that didn't match any environment where I ever see or give presentations (usually board rooms and senior corporate conference rooms).<br /><br />Most presentations should be much shorter, should have a lot less material, and should be much easier to grasp. This book will help you if that's the way you want to go. Beware, however, that you don't go over the edge into becoming an \\"artiste\\" in your presentations. This book will probably push you a little too far in that direction.<br /><br />For those who cannot imagine how an image might fit into a presentation, this book will be a great breath of fresh air. To those who want to copy the advice closely, keep your audience in mind. You might try to take them places where they don't want to go.<br /><br />In my 30-plus years of presentation experience, I find that the story is the key to success. One good story will more than carry the day. You can draw on a chalk board with your fingernails for graphics and a good story will still work just fine. To me, the weakness of this book is that it doesn't pay enough to the story telling aspect of successful presentations.<br /><br />I recommend Stephen Denning's books on story telling to help you with that aspect of presentations.too far in that direction.

B001AQR3E4|1.0|I bought the original DVD and then the special edition. Comparing the DVD vs. the blu-ray with the DVD on a low end multidisc Sony and the Samsung BDP-1200 which was considered about the best Blu-ray, I can't believe how little difference there is. The Blu ray looks like they tried to make it blurry and have no color. I have an older DTS receiver, so the DVD audio is actually better for me on the DVD, which is all the more insulting. Until now, the 2 years ago Sleepy Hollow Blu ray was my worst purchase, this far exceeds it. The extras are lame and in SD. this should be $4.99. Save your money! Worst Blu-ray remastering EVER!
0810994739|5.0|I have really enjoyed seeing the smile on my sons face when he read this.<br />  This is a book my son would read over and over he would laugh out of control.

B00005JPO1|5.0|Indiana Jones is probably one of my favorite movie franchise's of all time. When Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came out on dvd, I bought it. What did I think of the movie, well I thought it was a very good movie. The plot is where Indiana Jones is looking for a Crystal Skull to keep it away from the Russians because they'll use it for evil. Indy also has to rescue some of his friends and returns the Skull to the city temple before the Russians do. Aside Indy are his partners Mutt Williams (Shia LeBeouf) Indy's son, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who is Indy's first love, Harold Oxley (John Hurt) who is a wise Archeoligst friend of Indy's who goes crazy and back to wize, Mac (Ray Winstone) who is Indy's friend who keeps switching sides, and Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchet) who is the villian and isn't neccesarly on Indy's side. Now, I don't think the story is that good, especialy when it resolves to the ending, but it still kept me entertained till the end. The acting was overall very well done. Harrison Ford doesn't either look or act to old in this one which is great. The other actors/actresses were good like Shia LeBouf, Karen Allen, John Hurt, and Cate Blanchet. Cate Blanchet was particuarly interesting because she is one of the first female villains in any of the Indiana Jones films (besides Elsa of course). Ray Winstone I thought wasn't the best of performances, but his character was somewhat interesting. It's just to bad that he didn't really grab my attention. I thought the action and stunt work were spectacular and that is what you mainly go to an Indy movie for. The main gripes for me in this movie were 1 ray Winstones performance which wasn't terrible, but not as good as I expected and number 2 how the plot tuns out at the end. But that isn't what you go to an Indy movie for, you go for entertainment which is what this movie delivered big time. Now some people are complaining about the plot and some cheesy and far fetched scenes. What I have to say to that is that I didn't think the plot was that good, but for the far fetched scenes stuff, you should leave your logic at home and enjoy fiction. By all means, this is not the best Indiana Jones movie, but it is still a good one and is still worth checking out. I give the film a 4.5 out of 5.    The dvd itself is very good. The transfer from theateres to dvd is pretty good and the film delivers a very solid surround sound experience. The features themselves are very good with lots of interviews, behind the scenes at special effects, bringing back the crew, galleries and more. The special features only last for about 3-4 hours, but what they offer is more than you can crack your whip at. The 2 disc version is great and is way better than the single disc version. Overall I give the dvd a 5 out of 5. The whole package gets a 5 out of 5. You'll overall get a solid very good movie with some great special features. I say buy it. Also, peace out to you Indy fans.
B001F7MSFW|4.0|Here we have the sequel to the first Hellboy film. It's one of those rare sequels that exceeds the original in almost every way. The acting is quite good, the makeup and costumes are spectacular (and will probably get an Oscar nomination). The pacing is great, and the story is reasonably compelling.    All of this, however, takes a backseat for me when compared to the incredibly beautiful scenes put up onto the screen by director Guillermo del Toro. Here is a man who, as previously demonstrated with Pan's Labyrinth,is someone who really understands the magic of cinema and its ability to show things no one has ever seen before.    Consider, for example, the fate of the giant plant monster that attacks New York City. There's a number of ways the conclusion to the fight between it and Hellboy played out, but who would have expected such a beautiful end? And in a different way, look at what you get up on screen during the encounter with the Golden Army itself. Check out the Troll Market, which might rival the Cantina Scene in Star Wars for sheer creativity in makeup design. Marvel at the beauty of the Throne Room for the elves (marvel slightly less at the fact that the bad guy in the movie basically just another Sephiroth cosplayer).    There is, as I said, some good acting, a good story, and some great dialogue in this movie, but what will stay in my mind are the incredible images up on the screen, and given what a visual medium film is, I'd say that's a pretty good thing.
031606792X|5.0|As opposed to others who did not enjoy this book, I felt it started to tie things together and further explain how the Cullens and other vampires kept themselves hidden and how the Volturi were able to keep control of everyone from a distance.  To say this is just a book for young adults is not true.  This book is well written and left me wanting more.  To watch (or read) how Bella has evolved and how those around her handle the changes is a testament to Meyer's writing.  Definitely looking foward to the 5th installment.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|season 7 and here we go again.........the women talk more and more and get more convoluted by the episode....whilst the men get more inarticulate...........see it's just like real life. As Rory says.......women are from venus and men are bowls of soup. i find all the characters very flawed and very human, it may be set against the backdrop of a dreamy new england semi rural paradise with wacky characters but at its heart is the great human tragi-comedy of love

B0013URJTG|4.0|R.O.I with it's mix of almost atmospheric setting through to the wah infused groove and into the all out crescendo (featuring the lower in the mix crunch guitar that shows up on almost every album in different incarnations) into the final.   Hatesong has another great bass groove together with some staccato beats (almost an homage to almost a Cygnus X- book 2, and reflected in other bands like HeadenD's Nine Days Wonder).   Personally, I think that 4 chords that made a million is probably the weakest track.   I get the point, but the tune doesn't stand up to multiple listens.   Much better is \\"The rest will flow\\" or \\"where would we be\\" which is almost beatlesque with the vocal interplay and lyrics.  All in all a great re-issue
B001FB4W0W|5.0|THE ALIENATED WILL RELATE<br /><br />Based on Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series ([[ASIN:0441016995 Dead Until Dark (Southern Vampire Mysteries, No. 1)]], True Blood is a goth-romance about a small town Louisiana waitress (played by the hot New Zealander Anna Paquin [[ASIN:0784011176 The Piano]]) with psychic powers who finds herself caught up in the culture of modern vampires. After the invention of a Japanese blood product (Tru Blood), the vampires \\"come out of the coffin\\" and survive without feasting on humans. Survival is one thing though and desire is another. The vampires find it hard to kick the human habit.<br /><br />The creator of True Blood, Alan Ball, also wrote Six Feet Under ([[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set]]), and the similarities are apparent.  In the same way that Six Feet Under could have just been about a quirky family working in a funeral home or an intense family drama about people confronting their own mortality-depending on how you looked at it-True Blood is either a vampire thriller or a story about an alienated group of people trying to assimilate in a town where crosses are meant for worshipping, not killing.<br /><br />True Blood is the great type of show I've come to expect from HBO. It's lighter than Six Feet Under (but I was ready for that after bawling my eyes out at the end of that series). After wading through the gory sex scenes and rivers of blood, women are going to find the element of romance and relationships in this series appealing and men are going to like the sex and violence. All around good.<br /><br />If you are interested in more Vampire set in the south but have done Anne Rice, I would suggest novels by authors like Poppy Z. Brite [[ASIN:1596061162 Antediluvian Tales]].
B000A6CLL0|4.0|The Star Trekkie, whose continuing mission is to seek out every Star Trek Episode, to boldy go where no one has gone before: to watch every single episode, in chronoligical order, from Enterprise to TOS to TNG to... well, you get the idea. Seasons 1 and 2 went fairly well, whereas, halfway through season 3, I discovered my own breaking point and had to take a 6 week sabatical from battling the Xindi...<br /><br />In short, I found the cliche that ultimatly cost Enterprise its 5th season. Oh, I loved the T'Pol-Trip romance, which is one of the more interestuing ones in the series(es) being wrought out of almost complete emnity. And, frankly, loved even more the twist Archer took as he started to do \\"what is nessicary\\" for the survival of Enterprise and Earth in a story arc remincesant of \\"In The Pale Moonlight\\" from DS9's 6th Season. But there were problems. I never did much get exactly where the Xindi came from, even if it does have soemthing to do with the Temproal Cold War, no more than I ever got the Suliban plotlines.<br /><br />In essence, a vaild addition to the Enterprise story, perhaps better than the first two seasons in that it has a darker and grittier feel then even the first - ie, a more resonant, modern feel than the idealic episodes of TOS or the 1-story-resolutions of TNG - that deeply asks the questions of \\"What is right?\\" \\"What is nessicary?\\" and \\"What is good?\\" for all charectors, most especially T'Pol and Archer, ending in a clasic cliffhanger... Though the story gives, these very reasons also detract the classic fan in much the way the Dominon War cost DS9. Still, a worthy watch. 1 at a time.
B000002L80|4.0|I've gone back and rediscovered the brilliance that was Talking Heads now as a forty year old adult and found that I may have been wrong about \\"Little Creatures\\", which was actually the first of their albums I bought as a new release back in 1985; I had ignored \\"Stop Making Sense\\" when it was on the charts and had only become aware of the band the year before. Amusing anecdote is that \\"Little Creatures\\" was released the summer I was on a student exchange trip to Germany and the minute someone told me it had hit the stores I went out & found a copy on cassette, which I still have.<br /><br />Back then things were different, and they were one of THE bands to follow in my group of artsy-musician urban angstmeisters. At the time I thought it was a pretty cool if unimaginative record & literally listened to it nonstop for a few weeks while traveling around Europe. When I got back to the states and would play the album for my buddies I was somewhat dismayed to hear their opinion that the band had \\"sold out\\", and amongst the hip, in-crowd the record very quickly fell out of favor even while it sold briskly to more mainstream listeners. But hearing the big songs (the annoying \\"And She Was\\" & \\"Road To Nowhere\\") out in the college bars suggested that by golly they HAD sold out, even if the music was still pretty decent.<br /><br />Then came \\"True Stories\\" and it became clear that David Byrne had gone pop, and the rest of the band had gone with him. Boo hoo. \\"Wild Wild Life\\"'s success as a single was sort of the last straw and I more or less gave up on Talking Heads as a functioning unit until \\"Naked\\", by which time it was too late. By 1989 the group had stopped touring, split up for all intents & purposes, and I never even got to see them live. The disappointment  is still tremendous.<br /><br />One of the unfortunate after-effects of that disappointment was that I turned my back on Talking Heads' pop era -- to this day I have never owned my own copy of the \\"True Stories\\" album, even if I liked the movie -- and the greatest victim was probably \\"Little Creatures\\" which I literally could not stand for many, many years. Aside from the mind boggling 12 inch remix of \\"Lady Don't Mind\\" (which can be found on the newer UK import versions of the CD, the recommended version to buy) and the brilliant \\"Television Man\\", which has always been one of my favorite Talking Heads songs, listening to \\"Little Creatures\\" made my liver twitch. I put it away and did my best to forget about it for more than 20 years, managing to do a pretty good job it.<br /><br />That's because listening to it now as a grown adult, and with the benefit of hindsight due to being able to look back at Talking Heads' ENTIRE career now in 2008 and after their being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame (2004), it's pretty clear that \\"Little Creatures\\" played a very important if misunderstood -- by me, at any rate -- role in their evolution from an edgy post punk art rock band into a cultural powerhouse who's music transcended mere considerations like genres or commercial appeal vs. underground aesthetic.<br /><br />My opinion on the album now, 20 years after, is that it is actually a pretty decent record that just happens to have a couple of ultra-annoying songs. Specifically the opening \\"And She Was\\", as annoying of a pop single that has ever been heard, and \\"Creatures Of Love\\", a country flavored ode to getting laid on a regular basis & managing to find love at the same time, which is easily my choice for Most Awful Talking Heads Song Ever. I even managed to dislike \\"Road To Nowhere\\" while it was a popular favorite though I must say that there is something special going on in the song ... Perhaps a profound self realization that the band itself was on both a metaphoric and literal Road To Nowhere, and that it was probably time for them to end their association. Listening to it now sort of sends a chill down one's spine as David Byrne's lyrics sort of tell the story of how it all came crumbling down.<br /><br />Other tracks however remain openly brilliant: \\"Television Man\\", \\"Lady Don't Mind\\", the creepy \\"Walk It Town\\", the disarmingly domesticated \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Stay Up Late\\", even \\"Give Me Back My Name\\" which seems to be David Byrne asking for his privacy back after becoming a pop culture superstar.

B000KRNCYY|5.0|These DVDs are available in our local library for a three day check out. I thought, well, I will check them out and watch them sing. I never knew that I would be totally overcome with these singers, composer, Mr. David Downes and the incredible Mairead, the Irish whirlwind that you \\"can't get enough of\\" to quote David Downes. I immediately had to order my own copies and developed a following of each one of them because they are so uniquely different and equally mesmerizing. The songs literally soar into your consciousness and I agree with some of the reviewers that some of the songs may not be top choices as far as material goes-who cares, though.  The incomprable Maeve may be singing, or that Crystal voice from heaven, Chloe may be issueing her notes with those eyes of expression that tell you the words and sentiments are real...Or the fantastic with-out peer, Lisa Kelly transporting you to places in Ireland or Scotland( I have her Audio CD-it is sensational)or the exquisite Orla Fallon playing her harp and singing of Ireland, or Away in a manger, or Shuil A Run-she's magnificent and can show Joy on her face that has no parallel. So with the gifts that these women have, the shaping and molding and fashioning of David Downs, the tapestry weaving of Mairead you have a musical experience like nothing you have ever experienced before, so I can understand how audiences the world over have taken to them. I recommend you buy and watch the DVDs first, and then order all the Audio CD's that each of them have made. Don't forget to purchase Hayley Westernra's DVD also because there is another phenomenal voice from New Zealand and  arrangements well done, but you don't crave to watch hers over and over   like you do the Celtic Woman. It was wonderful she joined them at Slane Castle. I would say why wait, purchase the dvds and then the Audio CD's of any of the CW, you will not be disappointed.Maybe you can keep from getting the So called  C W O D( Celtic Woman Obsessive Disorder) but I seriously doubt it if you have any music instrumental or vocal in your back ground!

If this album had been made after \\"Black\\" they could have kept alot of their fans, I think.  Of course, I stuck with them through the (dark times) Load to St. Anger era.  Death Magnetic is Metallica saying to their fans and the world. We can still rock, without selling out our sound!!!

B001DHXT2A|5.0|First of all, people have to stop comparing this movie and Ang Lee's Hulk. They are in no way related! The Incredible Hulk is not a sequel! They are two totally different artistic visions and both were wonderful depictions of the Hulk dilemma from different perspectives. Ang Lee's Hulk was more of a psychological thriller/drama than a super hero movie; it had very loose ties to the Hulk from the comic book. It was a great movie in it its own right and in a totally different category than this movie. This Incredible Hulk movie IS the Hulk from the comic book. However, it is not so far out of touch that the average movie goer won't get what's going on in the story. Everyone can just sit and watch this movie and enjoy the Hulk without ever having to have to picked up a book and reading about him first. Neither movie was perfect, but I love them both. Each has it's own identity.     I don't know if anyone has really mentioned either how this film pays tribute to The Incredible Hulk TV series from the late 70's. I'd say that almost the entire opening was a homage to that series. Too bad Bill Bixby wasn't around to enjoy it; I'm sure he would have. Would've been nice too, if they would've thrown in a dedication to him in the end credits of the film. I grew up on that series so It was great for me. Also, having covered the origin in the beginning gave them more time to develop the story of what was currently happening in Banner's life. Telling the origin all over again would have taken too long. The entire movie would have to have been just about it, a climax and an ending. The development of the love story between Banner and Betty was awesome as well. The chemistry that Ed and Liv have together on this film is great! The casting for this film was dead on! Get this movie! You won't regret it!

B000001DQG|4.0|Elton John - Caribou  (1974)  (*** ½ )  14 tracks  (64:15)<br /><br />I was recently on the Amazon site reading reviews and stumbled on a forum thread about sad songs. Someone listed \\"Ticking\\" by Elton John. That's when I thought to myself, \\"I don't remember that song.\\"  So when I got home I started looking thru my EJ cd's until I found the song. Humm... Caribou. Now it made sense. Caribou is one of those albums I hardly ever listened to and am not very familiar with all the songs. That got me thinking. I needed to listen to this thing again, a little closer this time, to see what other songs I might have missed. This is what started me reviewing all of Elton John's classic era 1970's albums.<br /><br />Caribou, named after the recording studio \\"Caribou Ranch\\" where the album was made, is a mediocre album. Not Elton's worst, but certainly not his best. Besides the two \\"hits\\", The Bitch is Back and Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me, Ticking is actually the best song on the album. Most of the rest are just basic EJ songs. The Island re-master has four bonus tracks that actually help this album out over-all. Pinball Wizard, the cover of the famous Who song, is the best, but Sick City and Cold Highway are both really good songs. Better than most of the material on Caribou.<br /><br />I'm giving Caribou four stars, but really it's about a 3 ½ star album.
0670020745|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have a good friend who recently had a stroke and this book sure helped make sense of what happened.

B001G5IJVK|3.0|Kiss' Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley have stated many times that we can all expect to see more and more of these \\"Greatest Hits\\" packages.  It's the Record company's right to try and recoup as much $ from the deal they signed.  Seeing as Kiss hasn't recorded any new material since 1998 and has no plans to anytime soon, or ever, this probably won't be the last.    This set falls right in line with all the recent packages that have surfaced over the last 3-5 years, but goes a little above and beyond the others that have preceeded it.  Nothing new here for the diehards who already have the entire catalog (some of us multiple times in more then one format!!).    I will give this set 3 stars for it's unique tracklist and set up.  4 discs total, 1 for each band member.  I'm sure there's some sort of booklet included too.    Ace's disc is as complete as you can get.  Shock Me - Into the Void are all included.  Only tracks left out were the remaining ones from his '78 solo LP.  They even included \\"Dark Light\\".  I have yet to see any compilation of theirs include a track from \\"The Elder\\".    Gene's disc is cool in that It has \\"Almost Human\\", \\"Charisma\\" and \\"Larger Than Life\\".  Haven't seen those on a comp yet either.    Paul's disc contains \\"All American Man\\" as the never seen in a compilation before.  Would have been cool to include \\"The Oath\\" or one of the 4 tracks from \\"Killers\\".    Peter's disc, like Aces is very complete with pretty much every song he contributed to the catalog, save the rest of the '78 solo LP.  I've just never been a real fan of his song writing.  One complete listen to that '78 solo LP compaired with the rest, and you'll know what I mean.    None of the above reasons will make me run out and buy this set, but as compilations go, this isn't too bad.    For the casual fan who'd like a better than adverage retrospect of Kiss' career, then this is the one to go for.  Amazon's price is more then fair, plus the free shipping doesn't hurt.    They're still my favorite band.  Just wish we could get a big box of unreleased gems from their Vault.  Maybe one day.
1582701709|1.0|The worst book on personal development I have ever read. (being a coach and reading 80 books a year, winning the prize as the worst book was not easy).   The metaphorical message of the book is right: change your thinking and you change your life, embracing the future you want. But the author goes way beyond that, declaring that the universe will conspire with your positive thoughts and make things happen for you. She even tells you that if you are receiving bills to pay, it's because of your negative thinking: think positive, and you will start receiving cheques!! (well, that's convenient!!)  so, although the principe is right, the book goes way too far, thus deluding people into thinking that just thinking hard about something will bring change. thought without action is just philosophical debate: actions in accordance to our thinking is what shapes our future. No matter how you pray, at the end of the month you will receive your elecricity bills!
B001ERN1HC|5.0|I love this recording, funny and grity at the same time.  I hope to see Tom in a live preformance one day.  I'm scanning the papers for concert news.  It's a shame it took me this long to discover his off center brand of entertainment
0765316897|5.0|I've known Brandon for years and have read a lot of his earlier works. I'm astounded with how good The Hero of Ages came out.     I feel that story endings are Brandon's strength and Hero of Ages proves that. The ending is a lot to take in, but it will leave most readers absolutely stunned (in a good way).    The characters have changed from the previous books, but I liked the growth in the characters. Hero of Ages goes someplace different than where the first two books went, and that keeps the trilogy exciting until the end.
B00005JPO1|3.0|It took almost two decades, but Indiana Jones finally made it back to the big screen.  INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL takes places twenty years after Indy and his father found illumination and road into the sunset.  A lot happens in twenty years and the world is a far different place when we last saw Dr. Jones, e.g. there was a World War that ended in the defeat of the Nazis and the world is now involved in a conflict of a different sort, the Cold War.  The movie begins with a group of teenagers speeding down a long highway trying to race with a group of army vehicles.  Eventually the army guys turn down a different path that leads right up to Area 51.  The army guys turn out to be a bunch of Soviet spies sent to the U.S. on a special mission.  When they get inside the gates of Area 51, the trunk of a vehicle is opened and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and a friend of his the audience is just meeting for the first time, \\"Mac\\" McHale (Ray Winstone) are thrown upon the ground.  With guns pointed, the brains behind this operation makes her appearance, Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, who looks more alluring and ravishing than she ever has in any other movie).  Dr. Spalko claims that Dr. Jones has been to this place before.  Indy claims he hasn't.  Then Spalko weaves a tail about some mysterious object eleven years ago that Indiana was tied to and that she knows for a fact that it was brought here.  If you think this sounds more like a X-Files movie than an Indiana Jones film, you're not alone.  When I first saw where this whole thing was headed I kept hoping that it wouldn't turn out that way, but I was wrong.  From what we've seen in the first fifteen minutes along with the title of the movie, most anyone can piece together where the film is headed.<br /><br />That's not to say INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is terrible, because it's not.  There's a lot of good stuff that happens.  I'm not a very big fan of the overrated Shia LaBeouf, but I will say I really enjoyed his role in the movie as Mutt Williams, a rebellious teenager who seeks out Indy when his favorite professor, Harold \\"Ox\\" Oxley (John Hurt) and his mother go missing.  In fact, this is LaBeouf's best performance in a movie since HOLES.  Karen Allen returns to the Indy saga as the Marion Ravenwood, the love of Indy's life and the one he let get away.  There's a tribute both to Dr. Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) and the late Marcus Brody (the late Denholm Elliot).  There's a fun chase in around the school Indy teaches out and is now a tenured professor at, Marshall College.  There's also a really awesome homage to those B films of the 1950s and 1960s particularly in a scene with some really vicious flesh-eating jungle ants.  Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and Shia LeBeouf play well off of each other and John Hurt is hilarious as the tutor to both Indy and Mutt who for reasons that won't be named has retreated into a child-like state.<br /><br />Yet with all that and the great action, hilarious one-liners, references to previous Indy pictures and shows (there's one reference to THE YOUNG INDIANA JONES CHRONICLES), and a beautiful and domineering villainess, there's still the whole matter of the Crystal Skull.  For the first part of the movie, the Crystal Skull is like a McGuffin, an object that everyone seems to want but really serves no purpose other than to get things moving.  Then it becomes clear that the Crystal Skull isn't some worthless object.  It's an object of great power, but unlike the artifacts from the previous Indian Jones movies, it's not an artifact from some forgotten time but holds the key to the future.  The whole concept the ultimate conclusion of what the Crystal Skull leads to is the downfall of the movie.  I know there were some people that were turned off by the whole \\"nuking the fridge\\" segment, but I wasn't bothered by it; there's at least one scene similar to that in every Indiana Jones movie--itwas solely there for humor.  I could deal with the nuking of the fridge, but not so much the whole Crystal Skull.<br /><br />Instead of an Indiana Jones movie, the major plot structure seems more akin in the world of the X-Files.  In fact, much of the plot of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is like watching a rejected episode of the X-FILES.  And the blame for that one lies at the feet of George Lucas.  In 2003 Lucas was given a draft of a script for an Indiana Jones movie written by Frank Darabont.  Darabont had spent a year writing the script and had worked closely with Steven Spielberg on the project.  Spielberg loved Darabont's script and called it one of the best scripts he has ever read. Harrison Ford loved the script.  George Lucas didn't and Darabont's script was thrown out.  Five years later, this is the drivel that we ended up with: the worst of the Indiana Jones movies.  Thanks, George.<br /><br />Overall, INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is a decent action picture, but a very sub-par Indiana Jones movie. It's worth watching, but it's the weakest movie in the franchise and the overall plot of the film doesn't gel with everything else in the Indy canon.e for humor.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|This is a MANLY film in every sense of the word.  Swashbuckling to the max!  Beautifully photographed and with an amazing soundtrack, I was riveted to my seat for the whole film.     I found the character development and plot line quite satisfying and logical. The acting was superb! There were no slow or awkward areas and the film kept up a rapid pace throughout.      Sea battles, tactics, David vs. Goliath, it was all there with unsurpassed realism, and yet the film makers took the time to artfully explore the idea of life at sea for years at a time with a group of men in close quarters, and how they managed to maintain not only their sanity, but their humanity as well.    I can't wait to watch it again!  Highly recommended for those who want to be taken away to a time where men sailed the seas in search of fame and glory.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|This group styles themselves as Queens \\"of the Stone Age\\", but I think the band's name is a misnomer.  The music style played by Joshua Homme and co has more in common with what I imagine to be the wild and sometimes haunting numbers played around the fires and in the temples of ancient Babylon and Chaldea than the supposed caveman's bare measured beats.  It's not the QOTSA are playing \\"the horn, pipe, zither, harp & bagpipe\\" to give this impression.  It's the way they seduce their guitars, drums, piano and occasional brass to high levels of energy, to jauntiness and jagged sweetness that takes you to a time where men were more obedient to their impulses - the progeny of lesser gods.  The music offered here is not lullabies at all being more akin to tales told in our more primal history sung in all their fierce glory.<br /><br />For example, my favorite cut, #8 \\"I Never Came\\" is a glorious interweave of multiple stick beats on rims in perfect time (Joey Castillo is awesome) counterpointed by the husky male vocals of Homme, all coiled around an adventurous guitar lead. Your body moves of its own accord - the music is everything.  And yet, while I can recommend the music (although the quality of the audio recording itself is only mediocre) a caution must be given concerning their lyrics. When the Queens do so, they are not shy about describing in erotic detail their amorous joy la vie.  Cut #11 \\"skin on skin\\" especially could shock.  For this reason, I am glad that I can burn my own \\"best of QOTSA\\" cd, as this album, like their earlier stuff, is a mix (85/15) of songs both riotously rock and rawly risque.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|If you don't already have the Black Album, just buy it because it's the quintesential Metalica sound.  This is just another rehash of that same old sound.  The whole first have of the album sound derivative of \\"Enter Sandman\\".  Don't wast your 13 to 18 bucks.  Download it for free at napster and listen for yourself.  Ha, ha, get it, Lars??  Ha, ha!  Illegal downloading hasn't destroyed the music industry, tired old music has.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|This is not Andrew's review, i am Jason, his brother. I first saw this movie nearly two weeks ago with my nephew Daniel. I thought it was great. Anakin's Padawan learner was my favorite character in the film. The only drawback i had of the film was, Where did the main evil alien that fought Obi Wan and Anakin's apprentice dissappear to? Obi Wan fought the evil alien at the end of the film, she took off, and that's the last we see of her. And Anakin's young Padawan learner just suddenly dissappears too. That is the only gripes i have with the film. Other than that, i thought it was a great anitmated look at the Star Wars world.
031606792X|1.0|This final book in the series was just \\"ok\\" for me and I really had to struggle to get through it.  It is over 700 pages, but drags soooooo bad for about 350 of those pages.  The length of this book could have seriously been cut in half.  It was almost like she was trying so hard to stretch it out that she added way too much filler in the middle.      The ending was disappointing and the book was just boring to me.  I enjoyed the other three, but this one just didn't do it for me.
B000001FQQ|4.0|the CD starts off with \\"Rise To It\\", a pretty good little song that starts off acoustic then goes into a nice little guitar riff, the song doesn't blow you away but it's got a nice beat. \\"Betrayed\\" is one of the worst songs on the CD no doubt, it has a bad flow the background singing of \\"Beetrayaaaeeeeed!\\" sounds so corny it's not a song to listen to. \\"Hide Your Heart\\" is one of the stronger and more popular songs on the CD, and deservedly so Hide Your Heart is a very well put together song. \\"Prisoner of Love\\" is an ok song, the guitar is kinda nice it is all-in-all somewhat cheesy but it's a fun song. \\"Read My Body\\" is one of the underrated songs of KISS as a band let alone this album, how could someone listen to the awesome groove of that opening riff and not possibly like this song? the groove is great to this song, the lyrics can get a little cheesy at times but who's paying attention? This is rock 'n' roll. The next track \\"Love's a Slap in the Face\\" is a good song i found after listening to it a few times, it can grow on ya. Then \\"Forever\\" which I would hope most people know that this is a quality song, probably the best song on the album. \\"Silver Spoon\\" is another pleasant song on the album, good lyrics and flow. \\"Cadillac Dreams\\" is a song that could have been special, but the whole \\"I want, Money, Money, that's what I need\\" is a bit on the corny side for me anyways. The next track, \\"King of Hearts\\" is not a very good song, I didn't find this to be anything special, just a song to help run up some space on the track list. Again, the next track \\"The Street Giveth and the Street Taketh Away\\" is just simply ok, not really anything special but an ok flow. THe next track called \\"You Love Me to Hate You\\" could of been a hit, even though personally not my style of KISS, but for some reason some KISS songs are just flat out completely overlooked. Track 13 \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\\" is a pretty good song, it has killer bass at some points, and an interestingflow, but once again, the song just doesn't really blow you away. Track 14 \\"Little Caesar\\" is a groovy song, gotta love the guitar riff in this song, but the vocals could have been better, Eric Carr had a good voice but I believe Gene should've sung this song. The last song on the album is a hard drivin' groovy song called \\"Boomerang\\" that is pretty good but once again fails to really impress.  The one thing about this album is the guitar sounds a bit muffled, like it's not crisp and it kinda hurts some of the songs on this CD, this CD had major potential, but overall it's really quite average. Would I buy it? Yes, but I am a KISS fanatic, so only KISS fanatics should buy this CD, it is enjoyable, but someone who is say, a die hard Van Halen or AC/DC or Aerosmith fan probably shouldn't get it.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|To call the music on \\"Black Ice\\", AC/DC's first CD in eight years, redundant would be stating the obvious.  Then again, AC/DC has never been known for experimenting with their music.  However, with songs such as \\"Rock N Roll Train\\", \\"She Likes Rock N Roll\\", \\"Rock N Roll Dream\\", and \\"Rocking All The Way\\" it's obvious that AC/DC is not interested in breaking new ground.  Even titles such as \\"Big Jack\\" and \\"Money Made\\" bring flashbacks to previous song titles.   Complains aside \\"Black Ice\\" is a vast improvement over the last two AC/DC releases, \\"Ballbreaker\\" and \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\".  The songs stick in the memory banks much easier this time out.  For the most part I liked what I heard, however, I couldn't give this CD a five star review.  A five star review should be reserved for classics such as \\"Back In Black\\", \\"Highway To Hell\\", and \\"Let There Be Rock\\".  While \\"Black Ice\\" isn't a terrible release at all it doesn't compare to previous releases.  Still, it's recommended.
0440229081|5.0|I bought a set for my whole class because this novel is high interest/novice reading level for my 7th grade students with learning disabilities.  I love the dark, mysterious mood (great for the Halloween season), the colorful vocabulary, and the British culture that is woven throughout the book.  Students at this age (10-13) are able to connect with the characters and their challenges.  The interpretation of who Skellig is (man, bird, angel, ???) is determined solely by the reader. The author's description lends itself well to lessons on character traits, relationships, and setting.  We have great class discussions about \\"sarcasm,\\" as Skellig is quite the sarcastic being!  The kids LOVE IT! Get a copy for your preteen TODAY!!!
0425200450|5.0|In her autobiography, Dame Agatha wrote that when she journeyed on the orient express, nothing more exciting happened than that she had to kill a few bed bugs. The journey, however, provided ideas for one of her most ingenious and tightly-plotted books.<br /> So brilliant is the construction that she manages to have Poirot concoct two possible explanations of what happened and who did it - each involving a dozen suspects.  Expect to find Poirot present on almost every page, a wide range of characters who \\"talk up\\" well in the requisite interviews, some humour, and a resolution that bypasses the need for justice to be done.<br /> Only one film adaptation of this book has been attempted so far.  It premiered during Dame Agatha's final year and she pronounced herself well-satisfied with it. More satisfying to me has been listening to David Suchet's reading of the book.  Adopting and switching between perhaps twenty different accents, male and female, while reserving a clearly recognizable narrative voice, he easily feeds my imagination with travellers, a train, and a tale.<br /> In the 1930s, writers of detective fiction still retained the earlier convention of including, towards the end, a survey of who might have committed the crime, considering motive, opportunity, alibi, etc.  This happens here.  I registered a falling off of interest while this occurred; otherwise I was a willing and vastly entertained captive.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|La verdad que no termina de gustarme este disco. Lo siento plagado de lugares comunes y con cierto desden y falta de originalidad de parte de Hetfield y Cía.Tiene temas buenos y claves con los tracks 1,3 y 4. Pero cada canción ha sido un bombardeo más que un prodigio. Lo siento, pero Metallica de Master y Ride ha desaparecido, la colera de Anger ha sido retocada con filigranas de latón y punteos perezozos y toscazos. Lo seguiré escuchando sin embargo...

015206396X|3.0|\\"Graceling\\" is a well thought out novel with great characters and was created with a large effort. Despite those facts I still found that it did not meet my satisfaction to go over three stars. The story is interesting and unique. I loved the idea of the different colored eyes and the excellent heroine that Kristin Cashore made so realistic. But there were several things that brought the novel down to three stars. Firstly, the action sequences tended to get a little dull and undetailed, making it difficult at times to tell what the characters were actually doing during battles. Also not all the characters were explained well enough for me to actually know many important details about them - for example: how old they were.<br /><br />The novel \\"Graceling\\" is about a young girl who has one blue eye and one green. When children are born with different colored eyes they are given gifts - some magnificent - some less fortunant. This girl was gifted with something that is frowned upon for her gender. It is the skill to fight and even kill is she truly wishes. She works for the king because of this usefull skill and her job takes her on an unthinkable journey that most girls in this time were never graced with.<br /><br />This was quite exceptional for a first novel and I believe that if Ms. Cashore continues her journey writing, I will gladly read more of her literature.

B00138F6W0|5.0|This was one of the three albums that seriously put Queen on the map. You will be well rewarded if you add this gem to your collection rather than settling for some 'best of Queen' assemblage. It's albums like this that put Queen in the arenas to begin with.<br /><br />I originally bought this on the strength of the single \\"Killer Queen\\". I loved top 40. But the album had a life of its own and followed me as I grew up into FM rock / album rock. That's not to say it's perfect; it's not. It's just more perfect than most of the albums released that year. Initially I didn't play the album much based on the fact that side one had a few weak songs sequenced in key positions. The keepers are \\"Killer Queen\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\", and most days \\"Brighton Rock\\" is in there too.<br /><br />Side two is where this gem kicked into gear. Highlights are \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", John Deacon's first songwriting star \\"Misfire\\", and the album-closer \\"Lap of the Gods (revisited). But everything else on the original side two is worth downloading as well, at least a 4 on a scale of 5. You will quickly recognize the quality and variety delivered during the prime years of Queen's power.<br /><br />You may find better versions of \\"Brighton Rock\\" on live bootlegs (I recall a favorite being from [[ASIN:B000EVIE9E a Hammersmith show recorded on 12/24/75]]), and you may be able to find a few of this album's better songs on various best ofs, but to understand Queen's impact on the decade you'll want this album, [[ASIN:B004ZKLC62 Queen II]], and [[ASIN:B004ZJFH5K A Night At The Opera]], all five star albums. Count all three of these Queen albums among the best 100 rock albums of the 1970s.

B000HCO83Q|4.0|The third act of this tragedy or drama is this time bringing the fight within the mutant community. The President of the USA, with his Secretary to Mutant Affairs who is not even informed, let alone associated, to the President's decisions on such a matter, has paid for the invention or devising of a special genetic vaccine to \\"cure\\" the mutants of their mutant-ness. This gives the opportunity to the bad mutants to gather some groups and even crowds and to start some terrorist action against this cure in the name that mutant-ness is not a disease. The final battle in order to destroy the research center that devised the \\"cure\\" and the scientist who is behind the discovery is spectacular with a bridge rotated in order to tie up San Francisco to Alcatraz by way of the Golden Gate Bridge. This time the battle will bring the bad mutants down once and for all. The leader of them, a certain Magneto, will be injected four doses of the \\"cure\\", the winged son of the President of the USA will save the scientist, and Wolverine, the man with metal bones and claws on his hands will get rid of the too famous Jean who had gone wild and evil after her resurrection from the water catastrophe in the previous film. Then peace and safety are finally assured and men and mutants can live happily together thereafter and have many children. Such films are definitely naive as for the meaning but they are saved by the special effects and are entertaining after all. We could of course compare this trilogy with the Aliens first three films, or with the Terminator trilogy, or the two Star Wars trilogies. We would always find somewhere the belief that the future is not so grim as it may look and that good will always get over evil. Then the differences are in the surviving or winning models. From the Genesis or Ragnarok model of Terminator, to the bi-partisan peace of this X-Men trilogy, to the never ending resurrection of the Aliens in the Aliens series, to the democratic victory of the two Star Wars trilogies, we can write volumes on the persistence and return of such ideological, supposedly religious or philosophical models, but the best novel ever written on that subject remains Stephen King's The Stand.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesr Wars trilogies, we can write volumes on the persistence and return of such ideological, supposedly religious or philosophical models, but the best novel ever written on that subject remains Stephen King's The Stand.

0790733226|5.0|This is such a great movie. Jodie Foster is really good in this. It Makes you think and the acting is so good
1416575464|3.0|The book has some great ideas on how to get started decorating any room of your house. I would never have thought of taking pictures of everything so you could study them for ideas. First you make your plan and take your pictures, and then decide what you are  going to keep and what you want to get rid of. And keep a notebook of things you like and then make a drawing of every room and plan it out. This is where your pictures will come in handy. They suggest buying at least one expensive item when you redecorate so that it really stands out. I liked the ideas and the planning sections but I wasn't too impressed with the pictures. This is probably because I like cozy settings, cottage style decorating though. All the rooms in the pictures are huge and the furniture looked like something either from the 40's or from the space age. Even though I don't like it, some people will. I'm sure some would think it elegant. Great for people who are decorating large rooms or loft spaces though. I thought the kids rooms were dreary compared to what could be done in them. You can let your imagination go wild in a child's room but the section was short for those rooms and not very imaginative in my opinion. The book is really laid out well though and will get your imagination flowing on things you can do to your house and has some great tips on how to get started and how to plan it all out. There's also a card in back of book that you can send in and get a free subscription to Domino magazine for buying this book.
B00138H7YK|1.0|I didn't realize it at the time but the disappointment that was \\"News of the World\\" wasn't just a temporary setback, it set the tone for [[ASIN:B00138JBB2 things to come]]. If you have the first two tracks, \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are The Champions\\" on a compilation, consider that not having purchased this, you have dodged a bullet.<br /><br />Apart from the first two tracks which gained quite a bit of airplay, the only two salvageable moments from the rest of this dreck would be the two rockers penned by Roger Taylor, \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" and \\"Fight from the Inside\\". Of the remainder only \\"It's Late\\" attempts to rock but it reeks of a song issued before it was done baking and as such becomes the most painful listening experience that Brian May had given us to this point. It really could have been something given enough time and polishing but instead it sounds clumsy and studied.<br /><br />I cringe to think of how horrible the rest of the album was. Oh, if you were a 14 year old girl in 1977 I'm sure this would have been a glorious experience for you, but the ardent Queen fan could only be heartbroken by utter schlock such as John Deacon's \\"Spread Your Wings\\" (send this to [[ASIN:B001GD33DG Bette Midler]] and be done with it already) or Freddie's wannabe-\\"Melancholy Baby\\" song, \\"Melancholy Blues\\". Brian's song about sidewalk life and \\"All Dead All Dead\\" were, well, all dead.<br /><br />Please, add the hits to your collection via individual downloads or perhaps a best of compilation, but if you're going to invest in an entire Queen CD, make it [[ASIN:B004ZKLC62 Queen II]], [[ASIN:B004ZKL8VQ Sheer Heart Attack]], or [[ASIN:B004ZJFH5K A Night At The Opera]]. Until this point the punk rockers had no reason for existence, but after this travesty they had every justification to cast stones at the arena rockers who had become bloated, lazy and irrelevant. I still remember how mortified and sad I was in November of 1977 when I first heard this thing.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I don't actually currently own a pair of these headphones, but I do have a pair on the way. I have used these on more than one occasion since my VJ700's decided to blow out on me. The sound quality is amazing and they are super comfy. If you are a dj and play long sets, you know how important this can be. They don't swivel quite like the VJ700s but the compromise is well worth it. They are very durable and they wont blow out on you like the cheaply made VJ700s will. They may not be as flashy, but you will be extremely satisfied with the overall sound quality, durability, and comfort of these headphones! Kaskade uses them too, so you know they are good.

B0000BWVCM|4.0|This second opus is bringing the war inside the human camp because one military scientist who had had the chance, though not to his taste, of having a mutant son and who had manipulated him so much that  he had managed to take complete control of him, is provoking, or at least trying to, an open war of total destruction against the mutants. This time bad and good mutants unite to defeat that man though the bad mutants take over the game of the bad human and redirect the weapon from total destruction of mutants to total destruction of human beings. This drastic situation is saved in due time and just in time by the good mutants though the bad ones manage to escape and the good ones must sacrifice one of themselves to assure the escape. That will be essential later and it builds a promise because the death of a hero is always compensated by his or her resurrection, generally in that type of literature with an inverted personality. But the film is well built, the special effects are interesting, rich and at times funny. The dramatic tension is perfect and the President of the USA who was going to declare the state of emergency to take control of the mutants is informed by the good mutants about the actions of his mad scientist, and also head of some kind of national security, and we understand this President of the USA changes his ideas and convictions and moves towards a compromise with the mutants. But of course we know it can't last since the President was more or less forced to act that way and the bad mutants are still out there somewhere plotting evil.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B000YENUI6|5.0|Though David Cronenberg has calmed down a bit from his \\"King of Venerial Horror\\" days of Videodrome, Shivers, Scanners, The Fly, Naked Lunch, and the like; he's still managed to craft his best film in years with Eastern Promises.  Re-uniting with his A History of Violence star Viggo Mortensen (in a much deserved Oscar nominated role), Eastern Promises tells the story of a mid-wife named Anna (Naomi Watts) who finds the journal of a Russian teenager who died during childbirth.  Soon enough, Anna learns that the girl had ties to a Russian mob family, headed by an old-school boss (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Her search for the truth leads her to the boss' volitale son (Vincent Cassel) and his associate Nikolai (Mortensen), who appears to both warn and help Anna at the same time.  Frequently compelling and occasionally blood-curdlingly violent, Eastern Promises is one of those oh so rare films that actually manages to stay with you after the credits roll, and actually surprise you when something unexpected occurs.  Mortensen is spectacular in a finely nuanced performance that is undoubtedly the best of his career.  Even the smaller details, from his body full of tattoos, to his accent, to his sheer physical nature, are superbly detailed and authentic.  As for Cronenberg, he seems to have transcended from being regarded as a master of the horror genre to a master of the thriller, and his brilliantly orchestrated bath house knife fight is brilliant film making.  All in all, you won't see many films, mainstream or not, of the past couple years that are better than Eastern Promises, and here's hoping that this isn't the last collaboration between Mortensen and Cronenberg.
B000000OAC|5.0|If Queen had released this album and called it a day, they would be remembered as the band that gave the world an anthem for the ages. Go to any sports match around the world, and eventually the boom-boom-clap of \\"We Will Rock You\\" will thunder through the stadium. Watch any final series recap and you'll likely hear \\"We Are The Champions.\\" Over 30 years later, and they are the reason \\"News Of The World\\" remains an essential seventies album for Queen, even as the ferocity of punk was beginning to make its presence felt.<br /><br />Not that Queen didn't take notice. The third song on the CD is \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (and not [[ASIN:B000000OAA Sheer Heart Attack]] oddly enough) rates as one of Queen's hardest rockers next to \\"Stone Cold Crazy.\\" As usual, however, Queen took as many musical detours on this album as they did on their previous discs. \\"Get Down Make Love\\" is a detached grinder, while \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk\\" veers into Latin Rhythms (and is ably covered by Los Lobos on the [[ASIN:B0009W5IY2 Killer Queen Tribute]] CD). \\"All Dead All Dead\\" is a melancholy piece from Brian May, and ends with Freddie Mercury's typical camp crooning on \\"My Melancholy Blues.\\"<br /><br />It has been rare that any band could become so massively huge and yet be so willing to spin their styles all over the map. By having such divergent personalities along with Mercury's flamboyant, charismatic front person, Queen was a one of a kind band where the chemistry mixed perfectly. It made \\"News Of The World\\" an album where a band, so ambitious and bent on extravagance, simultaneously hit their commercial and artistic peak. \\"News Of The World\\" is, in my opinion, the last brilliant Queen album.
B001G5IJVK|4.0|I think this is worth buying if you are not a dyhard  KISS fan and wont some of of there hits that would not typically be on the other greatest hits but, if you already have this iteam i wouldnt buy it unless it is for a collection. I think that the tracklist for Gene, Ace, and Peter are great but the Paul tracklist needs improvement because its pretty much the same songs that are on the 10 dollar hits at Wallmart. Me personally having all the iteams would not buy this but for a young KISS fan i would defenitely recommend this :)  4 STAR

1582701709|4.0|The book and the video are the two sides of the same coin and I would advise you to follow the one or the other. I will suggest though that you concentrate on the video because the commentary between the quotations are nothing but the proof that some people need a lot more explanations and a lot of paraphrase to understand the basic meaning. Are we all without limits? And that is going to be my very first remark. From my long experience I know that some people are physically handicapped, or mentally handicapped, or psychologically handicapped, or with many hurdles on their road and around them. You should see the state of some of those children born to deep alcoholics or drug addicts. Or  what about children with a severe genetic disparagement? And I refuse to say they are just disabled, or differently-abled. They are handicapped by being materialistically in their very body or mind at a disadvantage that will prevent them from doing what most people around them will be able to do. If the mind is intact, and working on positive thinking is the only way for these people, then they can compensate their physical limitations with their spiritual achievements. But you can't run in the standard Olympics without legs just like a bicycle will not run without wheels. And this time, in most of these situations, one will not be able to excel, full stop and period, and if one can excel in one particular field in which he is not or is less limited, it won't be without the help of other people around them. You cannot think positive if there is no signs along that road. The second remark is positive. Apart from these special cases, everyone, absolutely everyone can excel somewhere and that excellence can only be reached if it is targeted, looked for and built. Positive thinking, education, understanding that the pleasure of such achievements is in the goal when reached and not in the effort you have to accomplish, even if for those who will reach the highest points this very effort is a pleasure, the pleasure of the effort itself. A runner has to train day in and day out and that is never, absolutely never a plain entertaining phase of relaxation and abandon. Physical pleasure requires sweat and heart speed. But if one does not set their minds on the aim they are going to strive towards, they will never reach it. Success is enormously in the mind, in the conscious and subconscious motivation of the candidate. Yet it is absolutely false to say that man has no limits. Humanity, and every member of it, has always been limited historically and no one could think plasma physics or quantum computers under Julius Caesar. Each historical period produces its possible fields of investigation that are limited because in a later historical period those fields of investigation will always be vaster, larger, deeper, more intense. Or then the author is speaking metaphorically of man as the representative of humanity in its cosmic history. But that is not helping any individual who is striving to achieve something in his own life. Icarus did try to fly but wax wings were kind of primitive. Then my third and last remark will be a question: why only ONE percent of humanity controls NINETY-SIX percent of wealth? If this is a fact, and it is, it is the proof that all men are not equal in facts but only in rights, and that is so by our collective decision to say so. But one thing is sure: thinking negatively is never good. Think of McCain and Palin and their negative campaigning. Think of all the anarchists of the world who have never achieved the slightest beginning of their dream which is only a negative picture of the world the way it is. If you criticize the world systematically, then your dream becomes the inverted image of this world, hence a negative picture of reality, and that will never guide or inspire people into desiring such a future. When I don't like something I do not ask for the reverse. I wonder what the situation is, what the possibilities are and if another solution is possible and which one. Then I will think positively along that objective, or rather as objective as possible, line, but to demand black because what I don't like is white, or to require red because what I don't like is blue is primitive negative thinking. That kind of realism and collective striving is absent from this book or video and that is a shame because they forget attraction holds the world and the cosmos up because it is always counterbalanced by repulsion. Otherwise the moon would have fallen onto the earth a long very long time ago, even if this repulsion is itself the product of attractions that are standing abreast and against the attraction of the earth. The apple did not fall as long as the stem was strong enough and the apple light enough for the stem not to break. The author of this book or video seems to have forgotten that the cosmos is a complex system of opposed spheres and when a weak point appears, then a catastrophe develops in that weak point, and the earth is doomed sooner or later in cosmic time to disappear, just like the sun which will one day have burned all itself fuel.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinese and if another solution is possible and which one.

B001CD6FKI|3.0|A visually appealing updating of a late-1960s TV anime that had 52 episodes, the movie tackles a contemporary and controversial issue in motor sports; a family business being wedged out of the game by the huge dollars of multi-national corporations. And with that theme comes the tug-of-war between fairness and corruption, on and off the track.<br /><br />Clocking in at a bulky 135 minutes, actor Emile Hirsch does a credible job as Speed Racer, while John Goodman (Pops) is the talented driver's father and car designer in a family business. The plot bogs down, though, due to multiple story lines which do not enhance what should have been a powerful theme of family values and the quest for truth on a track of lies.<br /><br />In life imitating art, a promotional tie-in was with NASCAR's Petty Enterprises, as its famous #43 car advertised the movie in a race. That family-operated business recently took on a major investor because it has struggled to compete against teams with major corporate backing.<br /><br />Though it may not take the checkered-flag, the movie has some high spots that keeps it from running out of gas before the end of the race.

The characters from Guernsey could be so many people I or anyone else would have known at some point in ones life. This book will be hard to put down.  It is fast reading with so much heart and warmth even though there is a dark side at the base of the story.  It is amazing how the human race can bounce back from unbeleiveable atrocities. There has to be a higher power to guide us regardless of what choice you believe in.  Enjoy!
B001DHXT2A|4.0|I'm one of those people who didn't find fault in Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" sometime back. I actually thought it was a pretty good movie and stayed true to the comic book mythos. Given, Ang took a few liberties here and there with things but, for the most part, it was worth going to see- to me. Other people, however, didn't think the first one was any good because of the fact that it wasn't like the TV show. Too, maybe it was the fact that there wasn't any real butt-whooping in the movie like Hulk is so big on doing in the comics. That's where the second movie comes in.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk starts off with Banner in Brazil working at a soda company and living in the slums with his dog. He tries to live a quiet life while trying to work on a cure with an online friend of his called Mr. Blue. When General Ross finds out where Banner is hiding, he takes his group of military people and goes after him. Unfortunately, things don't turn out too well. A member of that squad named Blonsky is out for blood because his squadmates didn't make it so he talks Ross into letting him stay in the loop in tracking him down. That, my friends, is when things get interesting. Without giving anything away, let's just say that Hulk gets a little more than he bargains for.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk-which was directed by Louis Leterrier(best known for Transporter 1&2)- is a more action-packed movie than its' predecessor. It moves at a brisker pace than the original and is, overall, a better movie for it. However, in my opinion, it is far from being as spectacular as the Spider-Man movies or the X-Men movies or even the recent Iron Man. It certainly has potential, though. Potential that I see Louis Leterrier expanding on if kept as the film series director. I did find several things kind of annoying concerning The Hulk in this movie. All were, basically, visual. First off, His color looked a little too dark to me. I'll admit, Ang Lee's version wasn't right either but it was more in the right direction. Second, there's not much resemblance between Banner and The Hulk when there should be. Banner's hair is brown whereas Hulk's is black.  Third, and lastly, his size isn't consistent throughout. Course, it is known that the angrier that Hulk gets, the bigger he becomes. While these are minor things, as a whole, it's those little things that make it a little less interesting to me.<br /><br />At any rate, overall, The Incredible Hulk is a great movie. Much better than the first and more rewarding on account of it. I highly recommend it. DVD extras include: An alternate opening, The Making of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, Becoming The Hulk, Becoming The Abomination, Anatomy of a Hulk Out, Hulking Out in the Bottling Plant, Hulking Out on Campus, Hulking Out in Harlem, From Comic Book to Screen, Feature Commentary With Director Louis Leterrier And Cast, and deleted scenes.<br /><br />Cast includes: Ed Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, William Hurt, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell and Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Incredible Hulk.n.

B00003CX8Y|1.0|It seems at this point that all the previous reviews sum it up, no comments needed...but since I am so unsatisfied I will go ahead and vent. I ordered my dvd on Sep. 15th and it was not post marked till Oct.1st(shocker).I FINALLY received my movie today.By looking at the movie it is obviously a copy, guess that's why there was a \\"delay\\" in shipping.You need to Stop blaming media mail for everything, your customer service royally sucks!!!Thank you for my refund Amazon:)
B001FEA9QU|5.0|This album is certainly what you'd expect from Metallica... Unforgiven 3 does a very good work of using its popular name... I was really worried that  Unforgiven 3 might not be very good.. but when I heard it... I cant decide if Unforgiven 2 or 3 is my favorite Metallica song anymore. Similarly The Day That Never Comes is equally awesome... overall I think its definitely worth the $10 or so it costs for the album... and if you love Metallica you WILL love this new album.
B0013ND30M|4.0|This review is for the recently released [[ASIN:B0013ND30M Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)]]. The colors are gorgeous, love the widescreen presentation, but I have an issue.  I have a 40\\" flat screen LCD HD television (but a non-HD DVD player) and when I play this DVD I notice a lot of blurring of the crisp edges, particularily when the characters are in motion. It's especially noticable in the opening sequence (\\"Hail to the Princess Aurora\\"), and when Kings Stefan and Hubert are toasting the impending marriage of Aurora and Phillip (\\"Skumps\\"). Those are the worst instances I've noticed so far, but it's all through the film. When the fairies wave their wands or move too quickly the wands and the outlines of their clothing have a zig-zag appearance instead of crisp edges. Even when chracters turn their heads sometimes it's noticable. Something makes me think it's not a defect with the disc itself. I'm not sure if this is just because TV technology has progressed so far beyond the original animation, or maybe my standard DVD player isn't up to snuff. Or maybe it's an issue with the restoration. Anybody else with a large screen television notice the same thing, or is it just me?
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer's \\"Blue Album\\" could quite possibly the best indie rock album ever to be created.  The albums begins with the song \\"My Name is Jonas\\", a mid tempo rock song with an extremely cathcy chorus. The album progresses from song to song with \\"heavy\\" guitar styles being incorporated into a rock setting.  This album has romantic undertones, but it is absolutely not limited to power \\"love\\" songs.  \\"Blue Album\\" also portrays life as a surbab teen, rocking out in your garage. There is even a tribute to rock and roll legend Buddy Holly. Overall, I rate this record \\"classic\\". It is a timeless record that will remain a \\"classic\\" more many years to come.
B00005JPO1|4.0|It was a fine movie, it felt like indie to me.  It wasn't exactly the story I expected, but it looked like they had a fun time making it and I had a fun time watching it.  blu-ray was totally worth it.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|Maybe I'm getting too lenient or forgiving in my old age, but I thought \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" was a pretty good time.  Some famous movie figure (I forget who) defined a good movie as one that had three good scenes and no bad ones.  Well, this movie has at least four or five good scenes (sequences, actually), and nothing bad.<br /><br />And the characters and their interactions actually move beyond just being fun and into genuinely memorable territory a time or two, as well.  A favorite moment was when Jim Broadbent's college dean character comments to Indy, during a conversation about the recent losses of Indy's dad and their friend Marcus, that everyone eventually reaches a point where \\"life stops giving you things and starts taking them away.\\"  That's a sad, resonant line worthy of Hollywood's serious fall dramas.<br /><br />But, yes, this is an action movie primarily, and the action is very good... and it's aided by the most lavish, polished effects of the series.  Likewise the villains, the sense of mystery, Indy's cocky yet \\"am I sure I know what I'm doing?\\" attitude with the characters around him, all of it works.<br /><br />Somewhat annoyingly, Paramount, Lucasfilm or whoever is making fans choose between a bare-bones DVD of the film or a two-disc set with all kinds of special features.  I found the latter a bit pricey, so I bought the single-disc version.  However, even here I was able to enjoy a nice little mini-doc (about 17 minutes) about how the new film came to be and a short pre-production piece (about 9 minutes) about the actors' preparations prior to filming.  And that was actually perfect for me, as I enjoy special features on a DVD, but don't like when it gets to be a \\"tail wagging the dog\\" situation... you know, where a two-hour movie is accompanied by seven or eight hours of special features.  Maybe in some cases that's good (if the film is a timeless classic or if you're just a huge, huge fan of a certain movie), but mostly I think the film itself should be the centerpiece of its DVD version.<br /><br />Anyway, ignore the nitpickers and pick up this new Indiana Jones adventure (in whatever version suits you).  I can't imagine anyone who enjoyed the other movies in this series not liking this one, too, at least a little.e film itself should be the centerpiece of its DVD version.

B001BPJJ9G|4.0|This is an extraordinary movie in the way it delivers a simple story told to a child by a semi delirious individual.    Beautiful, magnificent, globe-jumping visuals intertwined with a simple dialog in a hospital between a suicidal person and a little girl make this an odd movie.    Nonetheless it is quite interesting.    Just the overall weirdness, in a nice way, makes you sit through the entire movie and then wonder what kind of mind conjures up such visions?    If one had to make a movie to explain the word \\"imagination\\", this movie would be a top candidate.    Watch it, if you want something that really does not fit in any genre.    Tarsem also directed some of the \\"Deep Forest\\" videos. If you've seen them, you'll have a good idea of some of the visuals seen in this movie.

3438052199|5.0|BHS is a scholarly edition of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Christian Old Testament.  The text is based on the Leningradis codex.  It contains pointed Hebrew text with cantilations, masora parva with references to masora magna, masora finalis and critical apparatus.  The critical apparatus notes textual variations from all major and significant manuscripts.  The introductory chapter has a pretty good discussion of the text and various editions.  It's all very useful and handy, making this edition the best value in a single package.<br /><br />It is definitely the text of choice for scholars.  It's scholarly content should not detract from student's or a lay reader's experience.  The size of the book is standard for text critical editions like Aland's New Testament, LXX, Vulgata or others.  Some folks like large fonts for their reading, but that should not be a problem either.  BHS has pretty decent size font, except of course for masora parva and the critical apparatus where the fonts are pretty small.  But the text itself is pretty reasonable size and readable.  I personally rarely read from the book itself, but copy the passages I want to study (either 1:1 or sometimes enlarged) and then take notes on the copied pages. So I would recommend people who need large fonts to do the same.  But I would definitely recommend this edition of the Hebrew Bible to anyone.  It's a must.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|We all know the story of Chicken Little (Zach Braff), the poor little chicken who tried to warn the town that the sky was falling only to have it turn out to be an acorn.  But what happened to him after the story ended?  That's what this movie tells us.<br /><br />Turns out that Chicken Little is in middle school.  His exploits of a year ago are an embarrassment to his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall).  And the fact that there are commemorative plates and an upcoming movie based on the story haven't done much for the father/son relationship.<br /><br />Despite Buck's constant pleas, Chicken Little is determined to prove his worth to his father.  And, just as he's about to put the whole sky is falling nonsense behind him, it happens again.  What should Chicken Little do this time?<br /><br />Okay, let's get the bad out of the way right now.  Yes, the story is a little slow in the first half and a little weird and frantic in the second half.  And that second half might scare kids until they learn what is really happening.  But there really is so much to love.<br /><br />Even though the first half is slow, there are so many wonderful gags in it.  Chicken Little's friends like Fish Out of Water and Runt of the Little are a hoot.  One scene has a background joke I love.  And once the sky falls a second time, things really pick up.  As I said, it goes off in a weird direction, but they manage to make it work.  This isn't something serious, but it is fun, and that's all that truly matters.  Having said that, there is an important moral about parent child communication that gets a tad preachy at times.  I don't mind too much.<br /><br />No, this isn't a grand slam.  But it is plenty of fun to entertain the young and young at heart.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|David has taken live performance to the next level in this DVD.  Backed by a great band, the Polish Symphony and accompanied by Richard Wright (in one of his last recorded performances) this is all any Gilmour , or Pink Floyd fan, could hope for short of an actual reunion, which won't happen now with Wright's death.  There is an incredible passion to this performance which, I believe, comes from the reason the concert was held - to celebrate the anniversary of the solidarity movement in Poland which greatly contributed to the downfall of rthe Soviet Union.  Highly recommended!

B00008PC2O|1.0|As another customer reviewed it, BEFORE YOU BUY realize most of the reviews here have been about the ULTIMATE DVD version and NOT the EXTREME DVD version. AMAZON is cheating with these reviews that not belong to the EXTREME DVD.     This EXTREME DVD has ONLY 1 version of the movie. While the ULTIMATE has 3 versions (more versions than this one).     All extras (except 2 things) are DVD-Rom O N L Y! Not only this your stuck with one version, and its SHORTER then the ultimate. The ultimate also has a 3rd version that can be unlocked this one does not have it.     The only good things are, the medal case art (but don't plan on puting the disc case back in the medal case it will destroy your dvd case), the disc art, and menu design.     Everything else is worthless unless you have that DVD Rom, and there is no 6 hours extra like the ULTIMATE which is great to look thru.     The transfer rate isn't that good so the image quality isn't clear. And there are a lot of glitches while the DVD is being played because of the multiple layers and the graphic commentaries in it.    Buying this is a BAD BAD IDEA.

Freddie Mercury is at his absolute best and Brian May on guitar is untouchable perfection.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|-This review pertains to the Frankenstein: 75th Anniversary Edition DVD-    Mary Shelley's classic horror story, [[ASIN:0393964582 Frankenstein]], has been dramatized countless times since the novel's publication in 1816. The first dramatization, a melodramatic stage play from the early 1820s, was called Presumption: The Fate of Frankenstein. The play resonated with audiences as it greatly emphasized the themes of scientific advances conflicting with Christian ideologies, of man's ego violating the laws of nature, and of ambition overwhelming conscience. A century later, in the year 1927, a playwright named Peggy Webling used similar themes in her adaptation, which was the primary source of inspiration for the classic Universal film. Garrett Fort, who also wrote the screenplay for Dracula, and Francis Edward Faragoh, wrote the film's screenplay. The screenplay was based on Peggy Webling's play, as well as on a produced play that was never produced by John L. Balderston.  To say that the film had a troubled production is an understatement. Originally to be directed by Robert Florey and starring [[ASIN:B0009X770E Béla Lugosi]], Frankenstein was ultimately directed by James Whale and starred [[ASIN:B000FWHW8Q Boris Karloff]]. James Whale had made a name for himself with the films Journeys End and Waterloo Bridge. Both Karloff and Whale can be accredited for the film's status as enduring classic. Whale, who was something of an outcast himself, understood how to create flawed characters that the audience would still sympathize and empathize with. Karloff, who was at the time an underpaid, unknown, and hardworking actor, brought a sense of innocence and vulnerability to the role of Frankenstein's Monster.  Joining Boris Karloff was a wonderful group of actors including Mae Clark as Elizabeth, John Boles as Victor Moritz, Edward Van Sloan as Doctor Waldman, Dwight Frye as Fritz, and Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein. Clive was a tragic figure, both in the film and in reality. He died before his fortieth birthday, not a full year after the release of the sequel [[ASIN:078323502X The Bride of Frankenstein]].  The greatest stars of Frankenstein were Boris Karloff, Jack Pierce, and Kenneth Strickfaden. Jack Pierce created the brilliant makeup for the Frankenstein Monster as well as most of the other classic Universal monsters and Kenneth Strickfaden created the electrical apparatuses seen in the iconic scene where Frankenstein creates the monster in his laboratory. The electrical equipment, which served no real function other to dazzle audiences, was featured in many films all the way up into the 1970s when it appeared in the affectionate spoof [[ASIN:B000G6BLWE Young Frankenstein]].    The story follows an obsessed young doctor named Henry Frankenstein, who along with his hunchbacked assistant Fritz stole corpses from their graves and used their body parts to construct a Monster. Originally Frankenstein wanted nothing more than to advance science to the point where the effects of death could be reversed, but his noble ambitions turned to blasphemous conceit and his creation would take on a life of its own. Frankenstein sends Fritz to a university to steal the brain of a genius, which will be given to Frankenstein's creation. However Fritz drops the brain and replaces it with another. The new brain is a dysfunctional one, that of a criminal.  Meanwhile Henry's fiancée, Elizabeth and his best friend, Victor learn that Henry's become reclusive and secretive. Along with Henry's mentor, the dogmatic Doctor Waldman, they travel to Henry's laboratory on one fateful night. When they arrive Henry seems fanatical and possessed with a mania. He insists that they stay and witness his grand achievement. That night Frankenstein gives birth (figuratively, not literally) to a pathetic creature, born of the components he gathered from the graves that he burglarized. Waldman, Victor, and Elizabeth are horrified. Yet they've no idea of the horrors in store for them. After coming to his senses, Henry acknowledges what he's done but the Monster has escaped and is rampaging through the nearby villages. Can it be stopped or will Frankenstein's Monster live forever?    This monstrously good DVD includes an audio commentary with film historian Sir David Frayling, an audio commentary with film historian Rudy Behlmer, Karloff: The Gentle Monster documentary, The Frankenstein Files: How Hollywood Made a Monster documentary, Monster Tracks trivia, Boo!: A Short Film, Universal Horror feature-length documentary, Frankenstein Archives poster montage with music, and theatrical trailer.

0439023483|5.0|It's very rare that I find characters that I fall this deeply in love with.  And SO QUICKLY!!!  Crazy names, but I love them anyway.  My previous favorite series was The Twilight Saga up until the release of Breaking Dawn which ruined it for me.  Please don't make the same mistake, Suzanne.  You had me hooked by the end of the first chapter.  What an AMAZING experience!  Keep it up! and I seriously CANNOT wait until Book Two.
B00005ASGG|5.0|Stylistically, this is a very interesting film from director John Ford.  The film begins with alot of colorful characterizations familiar to audiences with films as diverse as \\"Stagecoach\\" and \\"The Searchers\\".  There's also alot of brutal realism which would anticipate the work of Sam Peckinpah.  It's also interesting that Ford contrasts the traditional western as represented by John Wayne with the new west represented by James Stewart who made a series of \\"psychological\\" westerns in and around this time.  Also noteworthy is the presence of Lee Van Cleef who made his mark in the terrific Sergio Leone westerns in the sixties.  What is Ford trying to say here?  Probably sensing that his days behind the camera were nearing an end he probably understood that a re-evaluation was in order.  The paradox here is that the traditional hero represented by John Wayne is left to lick his wounds in the darkness while the more neurotic Stewart is the supposed victor.  The law of the gun is being replaced by the law book.  Ford sees this as a good thing but not without a touch of poignancy.  This is a film that some viewers may be confused by but taken in the context of the Ford canon it makes perfect sense.

B001F2W4Y2|2.0|I've never felt the need to write an album review before. It just seems like I'm listening to a different \\"Black Ice\\" than everyone else. I've been a huge AC/DC fan for many years now. I own the remastered CD versions of all of their albums. I've been anticipating this album ever since Stiff Upper Lip came out. After hearing the guys talk about writing better, heavier songs than those on Stiff Upper Lip, I got even more excited. Unfortunately, I took better and heavier to mean louder and faster. I'm not saying that these 60 year old guys should be playing thrash tempos, just that they write something other than the mid-tempo, predictable stuff that they've been dishing out (with a few exceptions) since Fly on the Wall. We've seen the Brian Johnson era do it (Shake a Leg, Landslide, Brain Shake, This Means War, Caught With Your Pants Down, The Razor's Edge, Thunderstruck, and dare I say - Heatseeker),  but not nearly enough. This is EASILY their worst album.
B000002C4J|5.0|After \\"Falling Into You\\" my Fave Celine album, and just behind \\"A New Day has Come\\" my 2nd Fave Dion album  comes \\"Let's talk about Love\\". Released in 1997 after the wake of her sucess with \\"Falling\\" and her mega hit \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" Titanic's theme song. (Got Played to death)     I Was still getting over the greatness of her pevious album, when this one came along. I listened to it a few times and thought it was merely just an okay love/romance record. I Wasn't crazy about all the songs like on her previous album, and I though some of them were to slick, icky even ( When I Need You, My Heart Will Go On, ect). I Could take the adult contemporary ballads of her previous album, but this was just too much for me. Some of the songs even made me cry. (Yeah I Admit. They made me cry ) which i don't like. Specifically \\"Where Is The Love?\\". So I put it to one side and carried on listening to \\"Falling into You\\". I Like Emotional, but THIS album was too Emotional for me.    Over the years i went back and listened to it again, (due to the lack of good music by Celine), I was in search of Classic Celine, and having played \\"A New Day\\" and \\"Falling\\" to death, I Gave this one another spin on my ipod. Listening to it all these years later i'm suprised just how different I feel about it now. Instead of feeling sad when I listened to these songs I was kind of glad and Happy, even though a lot of them are sad sounding songs. My favourites have to be \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", \\"Treat Her Like A Lady\\", \\"Why Oh Why\\", \\"Immortality\\", \\"When I Need You\\", \\"Where Is The Love\\", \\"Love Is On the Way\\" and the brilliant \\"To Love You More\\".    This is A Classic Album, and any fan of Celine and Good Music should add this to their collection if they don't already own it. The only Problem is it's just a little to slick. There are some filler songs like \\"Us\\" and \\"Reason\\" were too Bland I felt, but apart from that there's a good mix of songs on this CD. I just didn't feel there was as much texture on here as on previous efforts. There are 2 good duets with Luciano Pavorotti, and Barbra Streisand, and I like the sultry effect on songs like \\"Why Oh Why\\" and there's even a dance number \\"Just A Little Bit Of Love\\". The only other minor snag is the fact that \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" got played to death on the radio, back in the day, But other than that this is a really good album. These songs really moved me, on an emotional level. I LOVE This C.D. I Hope Celine continues to make music this good in the Future, instead of rubbish like \\"Taking Chances\\"  Buy It. It's Well Worth The Money.   TOP 5 FAVE TRACKS.    05. Why Oh Why.  04. Where Is The Love (VERY SAD SONG) :(  03. When I Need You  02. My Heart Will Go On  01. To Love You More    Peace and Love, Celine Fans and Music Lovers, Chazzy.

The sketchbook may become a person's outlet in writing and drawing and well presented at the same time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'm surprised to see alot of negativity towards Tool's fifth release.  I'll admit--upon hearing it, I was a little critical of it all as well, mainly because of the lack of songs.  I thought the album was way too short, not because of the runtime but because there is only really \\"Vicarious,\\" \\"Jambi,\\" \\"Wings for Marie/10,000 Days,\\" \\"The Pot,\\" \\"Rosetta Stoned,\\" and \\"Right In Two\\" that are actually songs with strong vocals--the rest are ambient fillers.    I'm not at all being negative, because the songs that are there are amazing--especially Wings for Marie/10,000 Days.. that in MY opinion, equals the genius of Parabol/Parabola, and could possibly be my favorite song on the entire album.  None-the-less, Vicarious comes second, because when I put the album in for the first time, this is what I expected Tool to sound like after 5 years--don't get me wrong, but alot of people thought this was a complete disappointment due to the 5 year wait.. I disagree.    Tool has always amazed me and has always braught good music to my ears, and 10,000 Days did not fail me.. so if you're an avid fan that for reason of bad reviews, didn't pick this album up--just go ahead.. after all, it's still Tool.  If you're someone who has heard a few things on the radio stations and are looking for your first Tool album, start where it all began, buy Opiate--listen to it for a few weeks, then get Undertow and again listen for a few weeks--repeat this until you have all of their albums and have experienced Tool like most should have had the priviledge of.

0201626632|4.0|[4 stars, due to possible personal bias.]    This short volume of 109 pages contains the kind of practical advice that I would get if I chanced upon knocking the right professor's door. Its tone is familiar to any bright student. One might seriously believe that, if Feibelman's advice were followed, the world would be a better place.    Let's see.    His advice on career path is quite persuasive. Who hasn't been enamored by the state-of-the-art hardware at national laboratories? Who doesn't wish for the financial security and the prestige that comes with a full professorship? Feibelman in Chapter 5 combines the two sequentially as the ideal career, gives sundry reasons, and concludes, with force:  \\"Financial priorities thus dictate the same career path as the scientific ones\\" (68).    In particular, Feibelman strongly discourages the too-common practice of working up the academic ladder, starting as an Assistant Professor. Instead, he suggests that the budding scientist:  1. start at a commercial or government lab;  2. establish reputation and become a senior scientist; and  3.(a) rise to management, or    (b) return to academia as a Full Professor (which is also management, in a sense).    But is it realistic?    Feibelman himself took a different, less ideal path. He was the dreaded Assistant Professor for five years, before going to Sandia National Lab in 1974. As of 2008, Feibelman is still at Sandia. Perhaps scientific priorities dictate that some must remain in government labs.    Feibelman lumps together industry and government when comparing them to academia. His CV (online) lacks any reference to industry, so his remarks concerning government labs may not necessarily apply to industry.    Some other points.    Chapter 3, \\"Giving Talks\\", is a matter of taste. Feibelman frowns upon photographs of experimental apparatus, long equations, DNA sequences, and other barrage of information that inundates many slides. We've all seen this. The theoretical physicist isinclined toward elegance; while the engineer may choose, to quote [[ASIN:0201543931 Semiconductor Device Fundamentals]] by Pierret, to \\"optimize the transmission of factual information\\" (v). It is a matter of taste.    Chapter 7-8: The scientific research enterprise is competitive yet paradoxically wasteful. One must seek all possible sources of funding for one's research, because it is scarce: \\"you are unwise to question the motives of the agency that grants you the funds to do it.\\" Once the funds are obtained, one must not be thrifty with it: \\"he who spends the most money has the most influence\\" (80). Also, \\"No one ever got ahead in science by saving money\\" (105).    In Chapter 8, Feibelman warns the postdoc: \\"Working on more than one project is the only way a young (or any!) scientist should undertake an inherently long-term project\\" (102). Implicit Corollary: Where does that leave the PhD candidates, whose dissertations are inherently long-term projects?

There's no excuse for it. It ruined everything that the first 3 books were leading up to. And she kept reusing the same facial expressions over and over again and how their voices were like bells and stuff. We got it already.... move on. And Renesmee? Stupidest name ever! Stop reading the saga after book 3. I wish I never read it.
B000SKRZIC|5.0|Strange Days has some really great music. I always thought the introductory album by the Doors was there best music, but for their early period, well before L.A. Woman, Strange Days may be their best music in an early album that they ever did. I won't go on to list the songs on the album, but just say if you really like the Doors as I do, this is one album you don't want to miss. I mean it. It really has some great music in it.

B0017APPT8|5.0|I would rate this as a 4 out of 5 as far the the Blu-ray picture quality goes and also 4 out of 5 for audio.<br /><br />There are a few scenes where grain in the sky is very apparent, but most of the picture is a very reasonable quality.<br /><br />I won't bother mentioning the film, as many reviewers already have. Overall, this is a great movie and if you are thinking of upgrading your DVD to Blu-ray, it's well worth it.
B00004R99U|2.0|I think it goes without saying that you shouldn't expect historical accuracy out of Disney. This is a company built on talking mice and mermaids, so I didn't wasn't looking for a history lesson. That aside, this movie wasn't as horrible as most of the direct-to-video sequels. The songs weren't memorable, but they didn't grate on my nerves. And, while I'm no expert, I felt that the animation wasn't bad either. It wasn't on par with the first movie. But it wouldn't have been out of place on a Saturday morning cartoon.<br /><br />My 3-year-old seemed to have mixed feelings about this one. She loved that Pocahontas danced in a ballgown, just like the other Disney princesses. But there were long stretches of the movie with no action that seemed to bore her.<br /><br />Pocahontas herself seemed a little stiff and wooden. There was more chemistry between John Smith and John Rolfe than there was between either \\"John\\" and Pocahontas. Because of this, my daugher didn't really understand that Pocahontas didn't end up with John Smith.<br /><br />Overall, this one is worth renting. But don't buy it.

B0013LPS7U|4.0|As a longtime U2 fan, having started to listen to them as far back as 1983, I realize this review will put me at odds with many U2 fans. To be honest, I have never been an especially big fan of the first three albums. While I like them, I merely find them interesting. Let me explain philosophically that I really don't care for mythologizing Rock bands or Musicians. For example, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Zeppelin have become so mythologized, it has become almost impossible for many to fairly assess the merit of their music, in each case, however great it might be overall, each has been `hit and miss' with their catalogue. U2 suffers from the same kind of mythologizing at this point. To not be intellectually honest, and admit that any band or artist has their strength and weaknesses, is actually a disservice to that band from their fan base.    That isn't to add or diminish U2's importance within the Punk / new wave / Alternative scene, and that should be acknowledged in the context of 1980 / 1979. From a sonic standpoint 'Boy' was a revelation. There were plenty of Punk bands that laid the groundwork as Paul Morley points out in his essay. U2's energy, simplicity, the epic, ambient scope of their best songs could be a strength, but it could also be a weakness if done to excess. In their early career, of the four of them, The Edge was always the most naturally talented musician of the band, as a guitarist and keyboardist. Larry and Adam was a solid rhythm section, and while Bono had passion, he had to develop his skills as a vocalist. It just wasn't there yet.  Steve Lillywhite should be commended for helping to focus their studio sound, and it is this focus that makes the first five tracks, and their sequencing especially strong, 'I Will Follow, Twilight, An Cat Dubh, Into The Heart', and 'Out Of Control' flow beautifully well together. Yet the material becomes wildly uneven in the second half on the album, with 'A Day Without Me', being the other standout track.The problem is with a lack of song craft, there are plenty of songs on the second half of the album, full of promise that is never realized. This focused song craft is what distinguished the Brian Eno / Daniel Lanois production era. Now, what do I mean when I write `song craft'? What I mean is go beyond the basic blueprint of a song and find that right coloring, accompaniment, that right part, or lyric in some cases, that gives it that extra depth. This isn't to say U2 ever lacked `depth' in contrast to other bands, U2 demonstrated depth from the beginning, but too many songs just feel like blueprints, and the gears are not completely gelling at that stage of their career. Yes, they were a new band, full of exuberance at recording and touring, as that should be pointed out, but to maintain U2 was a flawless band from outset is dishonest.     Now onto disc two which is the real treat for any completist, personally I have had a longtime fascination with U2's B-sides, therefore it is great to have one disc that includes the Columbia era `3' ep, as well as the Another Day single. '11 O'Clock Tick Tock' is a fairly strong and interesting track, as well as it's B-side 'Touch'. I actually find 'Saturday Night', which eventually became 'Fire' off of the \\"October\\" album, to be a better version. 'Speed of Life' and 'Things to Make and Do' is an interesting pair of instrumentals. 'Boy / Girl' is a very awkward punk track. To each his own for those who like it. The Columbia versions of 'Out of Control' and 'Stories for Boys', while interesting, are not as strong as the Lillywhite produced tracks. 'Cartoon World' is an early precursor to 'Shadows and Tall Trees', and it's an especially disappointing track, very uneven recording for a live record, and a sloppy performance from the band.    The sound of these remasters is an improvement from prior CD editions and welcomed. Credit really has to be given for the wonderful packaging, Paul Morley's essay, while not a definitive biography, is insightful and informative of the band's early influences, The Edge's comments are also interesting, lyrics and rare photos are included. This reissue is an ideal model for how CD reissues should be handled in the future, should be of note to other compilation producers, although some fans will beg to differ about what might have been overlooked.    Worthwhile.

B001C4AFP8|4.0|[[ASIN:1424172705 Fete of Death]]<br />As directed by Ridley Scott, \\"Body of Lies\\" is an engrossing, tense thriller adapted by William Monahan (\\"Departed\\") from a novel by \\"Washington Post\\" columnist David Ignatius.  It's a long movie, but I was never aware of its length, as the film is tautly paced and never lets up.<br /><br />Shot on location, \\"Body of Lies\\" is a gritty depiction of espionage in the Middle East.  As the title suggests, the movie is all about lies within lies.  In the end everyone is deceiving and exploiting everyone else and nobody can be trusted.  The hero, Roger Ferris, himself a CIA liar, realizes deception is the name of the game, is finally revolted by it, and comes to terms with it his way.  His boss, Hoffman, on the other hand, could care less about the deception and the manipulation.  Ever the pragmatist, the overweight Hoffman cares only about results.  For him the ends justify the means.  He has no problem with that--and the beat goes on, as far as he's concerned.<br />--Bryan Cassiday

1932907009|5.0|_Save the Cat!_ is the no-fluff, all-substance, straightforward, example-packed and WITTY book on screenwriting we've all been waiting for. My copy came to me with high recommendations from an industry expert, and from page one it was abundantly clear why so many accolades were piled onto it.  This essential guide by Blake Snyder is just what its subtitle declares: \\"The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need.\\"     Snyder brings his immense experience to the table and illustrates all his points with examples from familiar movies so there is no mistake about the skills he's teaching. The focus is on writing a screenplay that you're proud of that will SELL as well - and not on encouraging you (misleading you) to write some inflated \\"magnum opus\\" that's a florid expression of your individual artistry.. The business of storytelling is, after all, a business; Snyder gives you the information you need to master the basics of this business, and then to fine tune your personal writing strengths to create a logline, a HERO, a story and a SCREENPLAY that is primed to impress the industry juggernauts who hold the power and the money to turn your words into movies.     By the end of chapter one, I could write an effective logline for any story, and I felt I had a strong understanding of what was needed in an effective pitch. By the end of chapter four I understood the universal elements of a good narrative and how to create an endearing, identifiable hero. By the end of the book I had finished a first draft of a screenplay that I have more confidence in than anything I've ever written.    I didn't know that I'd end up saying it, but I'm joining the thousands of readers who swear by the effectiveness of _Save the Cat_. To call it a \\"must read\\" is an understatement in the extreme.

B001C08RHA|3.0|It is also updated for our time with events fictionalized from Afganistan, the villans being terrorist, foreign & domestic. Broad enough to spawn endless sequels. Sort of like the James Bond franchise. One problem, however good James Bond is or was, Sean Connery was the best Bond. Vodka martini references aside there are some simularities between  Bond & Robert Downey's Tony Stark (Ironman). He is the best thing about this movie. Let's not forget Gwynth Paltrow as Pepper, his friend assistant & girl everything. She is absolutely fabulous. I can't see either of these gifted actors wasting their careers on too many  Ironmans. It is after all a cartoon.      Tony Stark is a boy genius, smarter than everyone else & heir to a fabulous weapons producing empire. His ego is as big as his fortune but everybody loves him. He manages to get captured while on a visit to Afganistan by terrorist. While in captivity he builds Ironman & long story short, escapes. He returns home a changed man & has a revelation to change the world. He creates another better Ironman to destroy all the weapons of destruction his company has sold to the world. This is not taken well by partners & others that profit from this military industrial complex. At this point the movie just breaks down into foolishness & mayhem. I reccommend this movie. It's good fun

B000S0GYRU|4.0|i bought susperia thinking it would be a masterpeice like everyone said....i was WRONG.the only good thing about this movie were the kills.the story was ok,the plot kinda boring and it took FOREVER to get to the good parts.NOTHING scary about this movie at all so i dont understand all the good reveiws.See the third movie,mother of tears,its a better movie to me and moves at a better pace then this one.i havent seen the sequel,inferno,but after seeing this one i never will.  Edit 8/6/2015. Cant believe its been 7 yrs since I wrote my 1st review on here. I guess time really can change a perception someone had on a film. I was young when I first saw it so maybe I didn't understand it much then or just didn't want to but I saw this again recently & I really enjoyed it. Everything just seemed to come together so much better now, especially the music which is amazing. The acting, use of colors, all very well done. Im leaving my original review up just for the sheer contrast in them & to see how much my opinion changed over the yrs. Id highly recommend this to any fan of giallo films, Argento, or just thrillers in general.

B00005JPS8|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. stars in the blockbuster movie Iron Man as Iron Man. His character is Anthony Edward \\"Tony\\" Stark, inventor, playboy, and self-proclaimed Iron Man.<br /><br />Iron Man is the perfect marriage of man, machine, and product placement. Despite all of the products placed in this movie, Iron Man is actually really good. The technology is crazy cool, action is on the money, and the story is tight. Verizon Wireless has the best deals on monthly plans.<br /><br />I am happy that Iron Man did not go the Batman route. Every superhero movie since Batman Begins and The Dark Knight has to have a depressed and dark hero. Iron Man was funny and serious and action-packed all at the right times. Maybe Iron Man II: Cold Steel will have a much darker twist, like Tony discovers that he has agoraphobia and has to stay in his suit in all social situations.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are worth picking up the second disk DVD set. Actors, writers, and filmmakers alike can learn a lot of from Iron Man. You don't have to have huge explosions to get a point across. There was just as much action going on internally with Downey's character as there was action on the screen. The extras on the DVD highlight some of these points and can be used to learn something about great filmmaking and movie acting from Robert Downey, Jr., whose father is Robert Downey, Sr.<br /><br />Published at [...]

B001FOR5XU|5.0|I just finished this story --> after seeing the latest film adaptation.(The Fresh Prince version of the story is similar in name only.)  The novel clearly is the inspiration for many of our modern day scifi/horror stories.  Standing alone, I Am Legend is a well written novel exposing the innermost human condition, reminding me of Joseph Conrad.  It also reminded me of Poe -- the human mind and soul pushed to the limits of sanity.  I Am Legend is a winner!

B001E75QGG|1.0|Like everyone else on Earth, I was highly anticipating another Indiana Jones movie.  Boy, what a disappointment!  Again, they brought together the dream-team of Lucas, Spielburg, and Ford but it does not work this time around, on any level.  Boring story line, mediocre acting, and a running time that leaves you restless and tired.  This film felt very \\"forced\\", like they made just for the sake of making it. Rent it if you must, but I don't recommend buying it, ever.

0783219695|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and for about a million reasons.  But I'll just share a few.    Chances are good that you already know the basic premise: Three astronauts embark on a space mission to the moon, but technical complications not only jeopardize the mission, but their lives as well.  Back on Earth, the Mission Control team based out of Houston work around the clock to get the astronauts home safely.    Based on real events (and mostly faithful, according to those who lived through them), the story does so many things right that most movies from the \\"disaster genre\\" or \\"rescue genre\\" to wrong.    First and foremost, we actually care about these characters.  Director Ron Howard and the screenwriters dedicate equal time to the people and historical events on Earth as the intense drama that occurs in space.  Besides the expected focus on the Mission Control Team who tirelessly work to get the Apollo 13 crew home, there's even a \\"prologue\\" of sorts before the April 13th, 1970 launch.  Perhaps the most notable moment from these opening scenes is when Jim Lovell (played by Tom Hanks) must decide whether to stick up for a potentially sick co-pilot (risking his chances of going to space), or to opt for a replacement.  Or how about seeing Lovell's youngest daughter almost being too depressed over The Beatles' breakup to go see her father's broadcast from space?  APOLLO 13 doesn't just delay the suspenseful scenes like JAWS or ALIEN do.  Don't get me wrong, those are great movies, but again, Earth and space are equally important as the other in this story.    What history buffs will most appreciate is the political and historical attention to detail.  Our three astronuats (played terrifically by Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon) are portrayed as everyday people with their own ambitions and personalities.  These guys like to drink and embrace their women as much as they venture into the unknown.  The Houston Mission Control director Gene Kranz (a superb Ed Harris) is introduced in a very unusual way --- a NASA vest arrives in a parcel from his wife; the camera follows the gift box, and once the vest (ridiculed by most of the staff) is worn, then we see Kranz's face.  And Jim Lovell's wife Marylin (Kathleen Quinlan in another great role) does way, way more than just sob at home over her husband's danger in space.  I've always wondered this question: How does an endangered man's wife keep the family together while they may never see their father again?  APOLLO 13 answers this little factoid, among many other pieces of info.  Every character contributes to the story, even the forgotten NASA individuals who took every precaution in split-second timing to get their pilots home.  The modern equivalent of APOLLO 13 might actually be the TV show 24.  Rather than focus on what went wrong, the film wisely just lets the characters say, \\"Okay, something's wrong, and we better move quick or else...\\"    The true star of APOLLO 13 isn't even the special effects, which indeed are still impressive.  Actually, what becomes the foreground of the picture is all of the scientific detail that goes into solving the horrifying problem of getting three men trapped in a fragile spacecraft back to Earth.  APOLLO 13 does a perfect job in helping us understand what's going on at every second of the crisis.  News telecasts (some archival footage, some reenacted) show TV experts and old interviews that viewers at home would've seen.  The Mission Control crew in Houston speak an unbelievable amount of lingo that I'm not sure I understood everything they said.  But then when you see them draw on chalkboards, or put together models.  And even if you don't understand what the technicians are saying, their vocal tone & behavior will make it clear.  Simply put, anybody can understand what's going on in APOLLO 13, from the cultural events to the space sequences.  Rather than insult your intelligence, APOLLO 13 puts it to work, and makes you a smarter person because of it.    I'll leave the rest for you to discover, but I want to give a final recommendation to any educators or concerned parents that are reading this review.  In addition to a fabulous wealth of extras that everyone should check out, this 2-disc includes the IMAX version of APOLLO 13.  This IMAX features slightly better video & audio quality, but the great thing about this version is that it's about 15 minutes shorter.  The scenes that were cut from this IMAX version were mainly the ones that might offend parents, meaning you won't hear any curse words or see couples making out with each other.  This film that was released in theaters was originally PG-13 for a couple days, so if you're concerned about the content your kids watch, the IMAX cut isn't going to offend anybody.  Plus, this IMAX version removed some of the scenes on Earth that came before the space launch.  So, if you just want to get to the \\"good stuff\\", then you have an alternative version.    APOLLO 13 is perfect in every way.  It's exciting, educational. uplifting, well-crafted, well-acted, and an important chapter in American history.  I don't really care about what happens in space, and I personally hate science.  But if a film can take a subject I despise and win me over, then I owe it to the filmmakers to share it with every person I possibly can.  Decades from now, APOLLO 13 is going to hold up incredibly well with future audiences.  There are so many movies coming out that it's hard for new film buffs to know which ones to pick.  APOLLO 13 doesn't deserve to be forgotten.
B00138CV50|5.0|I own the Box of Pearls which includes all of the recordings that Janis ever made. I especially like the Pearl album because it is a large part of her history. She died before the album was ever released, hints the name Pearl (her nickname). It may not have been the same as her other albums, but still I find it interesting because she never knew the success and fame she holds today. Pearl is a great album for any true Janis Joplin fan because it was the very last album she made. Pearl shows a much softer side of Janis' voice on many of the tracks, which may also show the point that she was at in her life. No matter the preference, it was still Janis and Pearl is an essential for any true Janis Joplin fan.
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|If you're an AC/DC groupie, \\"Black Ice\\" is a must have. If you're the casual rock-n-roll listener hoping for another anthem, not so much. There are 15 tracks on this new effort, 13 of them are indistinguishable and have the characteristic vocals and instrumentation. The track \\"Rock-n-Roll Dream\\" starts as tempo-down, bluesy, but then kicks up-tempo so this one's a bit different but no more a standout. Finally, I was hoping that the title track \\"Black Ice\\" - actually the final track on the CD - would be the standout hit but instead derives its familiar, funky beat from Motley Crue's \\"Too Young to Fall in Love\\". Guess they were hoping too much time had passed since the '80s for anyone to recognize that, uh no.<br /><br />So for me, this CD is a big, no-hit disappointment. But like I said at the start, if you're a fan-boy then it's more of what you love about them already, even though they're your grandparents' age now. Well, good for them, I guess.
B000JMK6LC|1.0|The men who died and risked their lives were true heroes, and true men of honor, not this band of candy-coated liberal sissies that made the movie.   I'm sorry they missed the chance to film a movie that would truly honor the fallen and be a memorial to them.  This is just another heap of Hollywood and Liberal media style bs.      Oh please.  Of all people to play the part of a heroic paramedic risking his life to save others, Nicholas Cage?  Cage?  The talentless actor who makes millions per year, couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, doesn't even do the minimum expected that any of us would do if we were in such a fortunate position--working out, fixing his male pattern baldness, taking acting lessons, looking decent, etc.  If anything, he is the OPPOSITE of the character he was casting.      Storyline does not even remotely follow the truth about what happened that day among the real people the story was supposed to be about.      Shame on everyone who created this film.  Very sorry job.
0307383415|3.0|Long before he was a candidate to be President of the United States, or even a candidate for the state legislature, Barack Obama wrote \\"Dreams from My Father\\".  He had been elected as the first African-American president of the \\"Harvard Law Review\\", and if that had been the end of his public career, this book would have long been out of print.  But, with Obama running for the U.S. Senate, it was reprinted, and now his Presidential run has undoubtedly increased the interest in this work.    This is an interesting book, though certainly Obama's skill as a writer does not match that of his skill as an orator.  The book is divided into three sections: \\"Origins\\", a look at his younger days; \\"Chicago\\", his decision to move to Chicago and work as a community organizer; and \\"Kenya\\", about his visit to see his extended family in the country where his father was born.  The edition which I read also includes two introductions: one written for the original release of the book; and a second introduction written for the 2004 edition during his run for U.S. Senate.  The book closes with a brief epilogue, and an excerpt from his second book \\"The Audacity of Hope\\".    \\"Origins\\" is an interesting look at some of the aspects of his growing up.  This section is focused primarily on race, which is not surprising considering the reason he was asked to write the book.  This section also contains key stories about his family, and most importantly his father, but I wish he had spent more time on that part of his life in this book.  The section starts with the period prior to his realizing that race was important, and moves through a brief example of his being embarrassed by it, to a longer period of his taking on what is often considered the typical lifestyle of young black men.  Finally he seems to break out of the trap he was falling into and embraces who he really is.  The stories are rather a sparse collection from his childhood, so this is by no means a full biography, but one does geta glimpse of the road he took to get to where he is, including a detour into drugs, and touches on the death of his father.  It is a story which takes him from Hawaii to Indonesia; to California and on to New York.      \\"Chicago\\" covers the period when he decided to become a community organizer.  At the time he was in New York City, and initially he seems to be pulled away from his decision by corporate America.  He then rededicates himself to his decision, and after some initial difficulties he meets Marty Kaufman, who offers him a position in Chicago, which he decides to take once he realizes that he has not connected with New York.  His stories of his initial attempts and initial failures are interesting and insightful.  It is in the last chapter of this section where he meets Reverend Jeremiah Wright Jr., and is introduced to the workings of the Trinity United Church of Christ.  This occurs after he has decided to attend Harvard, and it is clear that Reverend Wright had a huge impact on him.  It is here that he talks about the \\"Audacity of Hope\\" sermon, after which he would title his second book.  Reverend Wright has become a controversial figure, and there are some signs of his controversial views in Obama's description, but the real impact appears to be in helping Obama find a connection to his faith, and not a case of Wright's opinion's or views leading Obama away from who he is.    \\"Kenya\\" covers Obama's trip to Kenya to meet his relatives before he goes on to attend Harvard.  For me this was the most interesting section of the book, as it gives the reader a look at Obama's extended family, and the interactions between the members.  It is also a look inside life in Kenya, and Barack's search to get to know his father.  It is also in this section where Barack Obama realizes exactly who he is.  Barack forms a fairly strong relationship with his half sister Auma, in spite of the distance and the difficulties which it creates.  Both of them seem to be searchingto define themselves in the world in which they live.    Oddly enough, though it was his being the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review which caused this book to be written, there is very little mention of his time at Harvard included; just a couple paragraphs in the Epilogue cover that period.  That is perhaps the weakness of this book, as there are many gaps in his story which are not covered or receive only passing mention.  What are included, are undoubtedly the events which he considers the most significant in his search for who he is.      I would have liked to learn more about some other parts of his life as well.  The strength of this book is that it was written before Barack had entered the political arena, so while it is certainly possible that he had already decided to pursue such a career, he could not possibly have known how successful he would be, or how far he would go.  Thus I believe he was very honest in the telling of his story.  Overall, this is not a literary masterpiece, but it is an interesting read and provides insight into a man who is very likely to become the first African-American U.S. President.
B001AIRUPE|1.0|I never opened the DVDs because the Jack Skellington bust was broken and I had to send everything back.  I reordered and the second bust was also broken and instead of Amazon looking at their stock and finding one not broken Amazon just refunded my money - end of story.    Not satisfied at all.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Those who loved the series will not be disappointed with the movie.  That's the first good news.  The second is that this \\"special edition\\" DVD version comes with the director's commentary, as well as a special feature where he and Sarah Jessica Parker discuss the movie, and there are 12 additional minutes of film.  If you're thinking of buying the movie, the \\"special edition\\" is the one to get.
B0018M6J90|4.0|I almost gave up on this 90-minute film halfway through. I saw generally where it was going, and I thought the road there would be rather ordinary. It was more than ordinary.<br /><br />Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) is a household servant whose employers never seem to measure up to her standards. And vice versa. Her employment agency has given up on her and she is about to be on the streets. But she finagles herself a job as \\"social secretary\\" to an aspiring actress. Said actress is trying to sleep her way to the top, with all the entaglements that entails, including rebuffing a man who is her true love. Miss Pettigrew, seemingly wholly out of her element, seems to rise to the occasion, helping straighten out the actress's personal life and introducing a new dimension to her own personal and professional life.<br /><br />The movie is set in England on the verge of WWII. The music is authentic big band-era fare. The scenes are played with a light touch, never completely farcical, but often bordering on it. McDormand is excellent, as usual, as Pettigrew. McDormand is one of the most winning, genuine talents in the movies, and in lesser hands this movie could have been a dud.<br /><br />To be fair, I must question the character development. The Miss Pettigrew at the end of the film has undergone a change which is not believable in the span of roughly 18 hours that the action covers.  This is an inconsistency, but the film is rewarding in spite of it. I thought the film was going to be a one-note comedy about offending the sensibilities of the preacher's daughter Pettigrew. But she \\"loosens up\\" so quickly, by the end of the film it might seem as if she'd be shocked by nothing.<br /><br />Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day is superb light entertainment. It is worthwhile for McDormand's performance alone. This is a movie to watch when you want to relax and escape the cares of the world.
1932907009|5.0|I thought that I had all the books on filmmaking I need to have. But I was wrong. I was still hinged to traditional way of screenwriting until I came across this book. The biggest trouble with screenwriting is to write second act (off course you need an idea too!!). This book addresses some of the inherent problems in traditional way of screenwriting. Although writer also admits that most of his beats are based on the existing framework but nevertheless thanks to Blake Snyder in identifying and demystifying the pattern. I also got his second book which is also amazing in its own self. Both of them recommended and considering the price it is sin for a film student not to buy it.
B00004RD54|5.0|and chances are you'll hear this album.  Unless of course your host is a complete idiot and their idea of rock n roll is Hootie and the Blowfish.  I laughed when I read the Lou Reed \\"fans\\" who said they didn't like this album.  They whined that it was unlike his other stuff.  Well, put it in perspective.  This is a GREAT album - and it doesn't need the extra tracks.  It's one of those one-off classics that just came from nowhere.  Loved it then, love it now.  You can't say that about any VU album.
B001G5IJVK|1.0|Kiss unsurprisingly deliver another attempt at some sort of greatest hits release. It seems they release 2 or 3 of these things each year without fail since they realized they can not produce any new music worth listening to and that people have gotten bored of the \\"farewell\\" tours that seem to come back to town every year.    There is no doubt about Gene Simmons dribbling on about Kiss being a business now rather then a band clearly means that he and the others will do everything they can to recycle the same old material in new packages to squeeze more money out of anyone gullible enough to buy these compilations that never get it even close to being right of what is the best material from what member.    It won't surprise me if this one gets re-released with a new name and cover next year with a 5th disc included that just says \\"Kiss' best of\\" and include songs missing here like, \\"Heavens On Fire\\", God Gave Rock N Roll\\", \\"Unholey\\" and such, or they will re-release the exact same thing, change one or two songs around, most likely just a live version of it and think it will be gold for them again.    Any real Kiss fan would just go and buy all the albums, and already have all the songs featured here, and then be disappointed with the selections actually put on this thing anyway.

Brendan O'Brien produced the album,so you know it should be awesome!!!!!!
0316143472|4.0|Every day, we're exposed to dozens of situations that we find funny, sad, ironic, thought provoking, etc.  David Sedaris is one of the few people who makes note of such situations and then can turn them into best-selling books.  His latest, When You Are Engulfed in Flames successfully follows his usual format.<br /><br />As with most of his books, Sedaris scatters his stories between his childhood, his young adulthood, and the present.  There are stories about his childhood home, one of his first apartments, trying to make friends with a spider, fighting with people on airplanes, and trying to scare away birds with the faces on LP covers.  But much of this book is about smoking (The Smoking Section).  For anyone who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s where almost everyone smoked anywhere they liked, this will take you down memory lane.  Only Sedaris can find the irony in our attitudes about cigarettes.  \\"It seems crazy to cut smoking mothers out of textbooks, but within a few years they won't be allowed in movies either.  A woman can throw her newborn child from the roof of a high-rise building.  She can then retrieve the body and stomp it while shooting into the windows of a day care center, but to celebrate these murders by lighting a cigarette is to send a harmful message.\\"  Also, \\"It's safe to assume that by 2025, guns will be sold in vending machines, but you won't be able to smoke anywhere in America.\\"  He's got a point!  He also details (in humorous fashion) his battle to quit smoking.<br /><br />I always look forward to Sedaris when I need a book that is entertaining.  Also, when Sedaris pokes fun at himself (which he often does), I can often identify with his experiences.  He has become one of those authors whose books I automatically read when they are published.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, this is hard but i actually enjoy doing it because when i am done i feel like i have really worked out.  My muscles really feel tight especially in my arms because the arm stuff is tough.  I have made it to level 2 and have been doing that for about 2 weeks.  It is nice because it has two girls doing the exercises, one who does it high intensity and one low intensity.  A lot of jumping involved for the cardio.  I thought level one was tough but each level gets harder and harder.  I am afraid to see what level three has!I would definitely recommend this although if you are just starting out and have a lot of excess weight, you might want to start out with something else because this one might be too hard and cause you to give up.  Might want to start out with something with lower intensity and then work up to this.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|Great BD! In the Alternate Opening, keep an eye on the bottom left corner when everything starts breaking up after the gun shot. You'll see Captain America come flying toward you in the ice. (If you hit Pause and then Slow Step, you'll see the shield pretty clearly.) Also, the U Control setting is a pretty cool feature, especially Scene Explorer - it takes Storyboards and animation effects to a whole new level.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|I am appalled at the negative reviews on this page and am absolutely compelled to defend this marvelous seventh release from Cretu himself as Enigma.      Like all previous Enigma releases, I was excited about the them-upcoming release of their seventh album appropriately entitled \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\" but even that excitement could not prepare me for the adventure that this album turned out to be. Despite being only two years removed from their sixth album \\"A Posteriori\\", it is as different from that as day and night in many ways. The entrancing album cover alone almost perfectly portrays the mood of the CD. Gone are the more space-oriented trance atmosphere of the former and this album is a sort of homecoming to the spirit of the first four albums without copying any elements of them. The echoing cello-strings of the title track is arguably the greatest jolting intro since the thundering drum beat of \\"Push The Limits\\" greeted \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\" many years back. From there, it develops into an experimental song that combines some classic elements with ironically enough HIP HOP! I ususally despite post-1997 hip-hop with a passion but on some rare occassions, it has produced some great material and \\"Seven Lives\\" is among the most experimental and greatest songs Enigma has ever done. The same goes for almost every track that follows. Some of my favorites are \\"La Puerta Del Ceilo\\" with it's haunting Portuguese lyrics, and danceable beat. Other greats include \\"Deja Vu\\", \\"Distorted Love\\", and \\"Between Generations\\". I don't care about what many others say. \\"Seven Lives\\" is Enigma's greatest release this decade. Highly recommended!
B0001611DI|4.0|I doubt most of todays audience will appreciate this as much as those that saw it at the theater, but it still has a cult following for good reason. George A. Romero was the master at Zombie movies. Sure the makeup job on this could have been better but considering his budget for his B movies, he did remarkably well. This is one of my favorites with the shopping mall as their hideout from the dead. The remake is pretty good too, but you have to see this original to fully appreciate it. Good quality DVD with extras. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Day of the Dead\\".<br /><br />CA Luster

0743496736|4.0|Although it wasn't as good as I had anticipated, I still really enjoyed this book! As usual, Jodi Picoult writes with such force that it was hard to put down. The ending was decently predictable, but there was no way that it really could have ended differently given the subject matter. I loved that a couple of the characters had returned from previous novels too. It was sort of like catching up with old friends! (Be forewarned...if you haven't read Perfect Match or The Pact yet, don't read the QA with Jodi section of this book. There are a couple of end spoilers!) All in all I liked it, and would recommend it to others!

0316067598|5.0|Luttrell's book offers a ground-level perspective on the kinds of operations the US Military's Special Operations Forces are engaged in all around the world, all the time. Too often this topic (Special Forces, SEALs, Delta Force, etc) is dominated by superficial books that amount to little more than anecdotes from second- or third-hand war stories. Not the case with Lone Survivor.     I suppose some intellectual types might not like the fact that there is little \\"contextualization\\" of Mr. Luttrell's story--and that of his fellow SEALs. But I would disagree with that characterization vehemently: the context is simple--Luttrell was on a mission targeting Taliban in Afghanistan. He was not working for a think-tank or camp-following for a network television network.    The story hinges upon an important decision the SEAL team votes on. The Consequences of that decision are grave, and Marcus Luttrell makes a convincing argument that these costs are high will never be paid for.    Lone Survivor offers the attentive reader a great deal of insight into the tactics Special Forces use in combat situations. More importantly, this book sheds light on the selflessness of the American sailor, soldier, and marine--one of the SEAL team's decisions, according to Luttrell, cost his teammates their lives.      To Luttrell's credit, he devotes a great amount of attention on his experiences with the Afghani tribal people who treated his wounds and protected him from the Taliban.     Luttrell's story of selflessness, sacrifice, and the tangible burden and stark loneliness of truly being the lone survivor on a failed mission is staggering. I hope even squeamish leftists who are opposed to the men and women of the US armed forces can see past Luttrell's occasional jabs at media personalities to see his story for what it is: tragic, heroic, and personal.     This is a truly inspiring book, and I am so glad I read it.

B00004WEJZ|3.0|The result of Kevin McClory's lawsuit against Ian Fleming (and much later Cubby Broccoli) over THUNDERBALL, it has Sean Connery returning to harness as Commander James Bond 12 years after departing the series.  A film that had a torturous history.  Originally announced in 1976 as JAMES BOND OF THE SECRET SERVICE (McClory's agreement with Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman called for him to be able to remake the story 10 years after THUNDERBALL's release -- some have speculated that the two Bond producers didn't believe the character would survive that long), he was promptly sued by Broccoli & company. Later Sean Connery would come on board with British Spy novelist Len Deighton (THE IPCRESS FILE, FUNERAL IN BERLIN, et al) to write a new screen treatment now called WARHEAD.  Connery even went on a scouting trip to NYC to check out locations (including the Statue of Liberty).  As legal entanglements dragged on, McClory eventually sold the rights to Hollywood lawyer (and Talia Shire's husband) Jack Schwartzman.  The film managed to lure Connery back for a reported $3 or $4 million.  Basically using the THUNDERBALL scenario (legally, it couldn't stray too far from the original story) NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a curious film.  While it works when Connery is on screen (and he is alot), somehow it isn't totally satisfying.  It lacks the sense of urgency and worldwide menace that the original had.  The Legrand score stinks (the fault of Sean Connery who insisted on him), the finale lacks the drama epic scope of the original underwater battle, Kim Bassinger is lovely but lacks Claudine Auger's charm; Klaus Maria Brandeur -- a fine actor -- is interesting as Largo but everything seems less than the original. Of standout mention: Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush -- sexy and murderously deranged.  However her character departs half-way through the film.  Edward Fox as M doesn't make it and Pamela Salem is a weak Moneypenny.  Some nice touches: Aftering water sking into Bond's arms at a Bahaman bar...<br />Fatima Blush: I've made you wet!<br />Bond: Yes, but my martini is still dry.<br />Released the same year as the Eon series 13th outing, OCTOPUSSY, the Moore film made more money.

0446579939|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks novel that I have read, and I am glad to say, it lived up to my expectations.  I expected a well-written, romantic read.  And while it wasn't quite as romantic as I expected, it was the right amount of romance for the story that was told..    This is mainly a story about Logan Thibault, an ex-Marine that walks across the country in search of an unknown woman from a picture he found while deployed in Iraq.  There are different flash backs of his various deployments that tell the backstory of how he gets this photograph.  Those parts also tell how he finally comes to believe his best friend Victor's claims that the picture is his fate, his good luck charm.    After a fishing trip with Victor, Logan decides to try and find the woman in the picture.  Using clues from the background of the photo, he figures out where it was taken and decides to start there.  He sets off on foot from Colorado, with his German Shepherd Zeus, and ends up in Hampton, North Carolina.    Once in Hampton, he starts asking around, showing the photo, and learns the woman's name is Elizabeth and she's a school teacher.  After getting her address, he shows up at the house she lives in with her grandmother, Nana, and her ten year old son, Ben.  Spotting a help wanted sign in the office window of the kennel that Nana runs on the property, he approaches Beth under the guise of wanting to apply for the job.    Beth is leery of him and his story that he walked from Colorado, and just decided to stay in tiny Hampton.  But after Nana talks to him, he starts working there.    He doesn't disclose to them his real reason for being there, but after a while, he and Beth become close and fall in love.  Logan is also accepted by Nana, and looked up to by Ben.    Enter Beth's ex, and Ben's father, deputy Keith Clayton.  Ever since he and Beth divorced, he's secretly been scaring off every guy she's dated, telling himself that he's just trying to protect her.  Also not very tolerant of his son not being the athlete Keith wants him to be, there is a lot of strain between them.  So when he sees Beth with Logan, he immediately sets to work trying to end it.  Also fueling his fire, he and Logan had a run-in just outside of town when Logan witnessed the deputy committing an abuse of power.    All the conflicts between the characters in this story, and the realness of their faults, made this a very believable novel.  I really enjoyed seeing what each character was going through, and seeing how Beth would react when she finally learned the whole truth about why Logan was there.  After reading this novel, I see why Nicholas Sparks is such a popular author, and I will definitely be checking out more of Mr. Sparks work.
B001G5IJVK|3.0|Michael, you obviously don't understand the music business. Gene and Paul have nothing to do with how many greatest hits packages get released. The record company owns the recordings. It's the record company that decides to try to re-package what they own into something \\"new\\" ( or not ) that might appeal to a more casual KISS fan who wants to buy one \\"package\\" instead of the whole catalog. While I'm also frustrated that there's no new material and more greatest hits releases than studio albums that's the nature of the business. Gene has been quoted many times as saying that the free loaders who download music illegally have made it so that he doesn't feel they should put out a new record. Would you want to go to work and not get a paycheck?... Neither would I.
0393061310|5.0|Dr. Diamond's magnum opus for which he has won an Oscar. Or maybe it was the Pullet Surprise. Something like that.<br /><br />Unrivaled, in the experience of this humble reviewer, in either clarity or insight, GGS, is one of the best books I have ever read. Diamond is a gifted writer and is able to present complex issues simply and clearly. He also presents several interesting hypotheses regarding the evolution of civilization about how the humans had uncomfortably little to do with anything. We are the products of the plants and animals we domesticated. So go read the book before I domesticate you...

I would say this cd isn't as good as their previous work, however its still way better than majority of the other bands out there. 5/5  Key songs to check out:  Perfect Symmetry-- great track.. very good lyrics.. very catchy, may be the best song on the cd  Spiralling-- first single amazing.. different from their previous style but works very well.  Lovers Are Losing-- another great song which is different from their old stuff.. recommended  Love Is the End- BEAUTIFUL BALLAD-- amazing lyrics  Pretend That You're Alone-- Chaplin's lyrics/vocal style makes this song
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Harrison Ford is a bit long in the tooth for this fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series-a bit thicker in the waist and jowls, grayer, and wonder of wonders the movie-makers do not hide these facts.  No botox or hair dyes here-just Mr Ford with his weather-beaten, lined forehead and all and in this installment most of the heavy-duty derring-do is performed by Shia LaBeoufs' stunt double. The story is set in 1957 and instead of Nazis the enemy is now the Russians. And Cate Blanchett is the villianess with her black page-boy hair-do she looks like Prince Valiant.  The plot is a mumbo-jumbo about returning a crystal skull.  Once the skull is returned to the mythical place of El Dorado-the land of gold-when the skull is returned to the other six skulls the returnee will be blessed with the knowledge of the ages. Things don't turn out the way Miss Blanchett expected and when she thinks her efforts will be rewarded the ground rumbles and uncovers a flying saucer and she and her co-horts are taken for a ride, presumably forever.  A flying saucer is about the last thing you would expect in a Indiana Jones movie but it is 1957 the era when ufo sightings were rampant.    Along the way Indiana is re-united with his long-ago flame, Marian Ravenwood and it turns out Shia Labeoufs' character is her son.  Guess who daddy is?    The movie is just plain fun and exciting in parts and just watch for scenes like a dangerous motorcycle chase through a college campus but this time Indy is the passenger not the driver.    Indy marries Marian and it looks like he is about to settle down but his brown rumpled fedora blows down the church aisle and and Indy puts it on-can that mean another sequel is on the way?  OMG
B001E95ZNI|2.0|Ed Harris wanted to make a western, a traditional western, the type of western your grand dad watched and appreciated when he went to the movies. \\"Appaloosa\\", co-written, produced and directed by Harris, who also stars, is unapologetically old-fashioned. I can almost hear him during some of the pre-production meetings \\"We aren't going to deal with any moral dilemmas, any ecological issues, any issues about how the West was. We are going to tell a story about two men who ride into town, try to clean it up because an evil rancher is running roughshod over everyone.\\" More power to him. But \\"Appaloosa\\" suffers from weak characters and as a result is one of the dullest movie going experiences I have had in a long, long time.<br /><br />The Marshall of a small town in the west rides up to Randall Bragg's (Jeremy Irons) expansive ranch. Bragg's ragtag crew of rough men flanks him as they confront the Marshall and his two sidekicks. Soon, the Marshall is dead and Bragg's men continue to take over the town with little regard for anyone's safety, health or welfare. The town elders (Timothy Spall, Tom Bower and James Gammon) urgently meet with Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), two guns for hire who provide Marshall services to towns in need. For a price. The town elders initially balk at the terms, but then agree, allowing Cole and Hitch to set up shop. They soon make their presence known to some of Bragg's men and the rancher comes into town to deal with the situation himself. Bragg realizes they are a force to reckon with and backs off. Temporarily. Allison French (Renee Zellweger), a widow, arrives on one of the infrequent trains and quickly makes the acquaintance of Cole and Hitch. Cole is immediately smitten and offers to get her a job playing piano in the hotel and assures her there is a room available. He has the connections to make that happen. Soon, they start courting and making plans for the future. Cole and Hitch quickly determine Bragg is in fact guilty of murder and set about bringing him in. But Bragg's men are almost as persistent as their boss and Bragg proves to be a little more slippery than Cole and Hitch initially planned.<br /><br />\\"Appaloosa\\" is an authentic looking Western. Harris and his team obviously spent a lot of time trying to make everything look right. But the film is a pretty straightforward telling of a basic horse opera. In recent years, Clint Eastwood, James Mangold and Kevin Costner have all made westerns that, along with HBO's \\"Deadwood\\",  incorporate the tell tale hallmarks of this genre into stories that actually deal with some of the relevant issues so often ignored in films of this genre. Racism, sexism, greed and environmental issues have all made appearances in these stories, giving them a greater relevance, more interest in our modern era and they have made more of an impression.<br /><br />So Harris wants to make an old-fashioned western? To make this work, that same western has to be an edge of your seat type of experience. The action has to be nail biting, leaving you always guessing, leaving you exhausted. There have to be some intense gunfights, leaving a lot of dead bodies. There has to be some carnage.<br /><br />\\"Appaloosa\\" has some interesting, well-plotted action. But it lasts all of about fifteen minutes. Total. And when the film runs almost two hours, this leaves a lot of time for talking, character development and plot.<br /><br />Generally, I am all for this. The more plot, character development and dialogue the better. If it's done well. But in \\"Appaloosa\\", the results are wildly uneven.<br /><br />The relationship between Cole and Hitch is unique and interesting. They have worked together for a long time and have reached the point where Hitch even completes Cole's sentences and helps him out when his buddy is searching for the meaning of a word. They are basically so comfortable together, they could be married. In fact, at times, it almost seems likeHitch is more jealous of Cole's relationship with Ms. French. Is it jealousy or a feeling he has about her?<br /><br />The relationship between Cole and Hitch is the one saving grace of the film. In fact, if Harris were to make a sequel chronicling the relationship of these two characters, I would buy a ticket even though I pretty much hated this film. In \\"Appaloosa\\", there are too many distractions from this more interesting relationship. All of these distractions are just wrong or flat out bad and the film suffers as a result.<br /><br />The biggest and most problematic aspect of this film? Renee Zellweger. This is easily, by far, topping the list, the worst performance of her career. As soon as she arrives in town, stepping off the train, I expected her to be Harris' long-time girlfriend, arrived to provide him with some companionship. This would naturally be revealed after a few minutes of playful flirting in which they pretended to be strangers. The very fact that I expected this obvious clich&eacute; from this film should tell you how much hope I held after watching just a few minutes of the story. When it turns out she is a stranger to Cole, I was surprised but went along for the ride. But their relationship moves too fast. Way too fast. For the Old West. It seems like they are talking about the house they just bought together after only a day or two. Would this have ever happened in the Old West? No, probably not. But Cole is clearly in love with her, and she is clearly in love with him. Or is she? After Cole tells Hitch about their plans to finish building a house on the edge of town they have just bought from someone who ran off, Cole asks him to go down and visit Allison at the building site. She wants his opinion on her decorating plans. No, I'm not kidding. When he arrives, she immediately locks her lips on his and he breaks the embrace to leave. When this happened, people in the audience actually laughed. This isn't a good sign either. People shouldn't laugh during what is supposed to be a dramatic moment. If they do, they clearly aren't feeling the moment. And this shows the actor and the director isn't doing their job right.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Zellweger's character ping-pongs back and forth between different men, causing them to discuss her feelings, motivations, her psychology. Again, laughable. God forbid anyone should actually talk to Allison about these things, but Cole and Hitch spend a lot of time discussing her, as though they are getting ready to give some notes to Freud.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons' initially starts off as a promising villain. When the Marshall confronts Bragg, Bragg quickly kills the lawman, unwilling and unable to tolerate his nuisance. But his character also makes some unbelievable changes throughout the story, completely robbing him of any power, any menace. At one point, Cole and Hitch take Bragg captive after he leaves the outhouse on his property. This seems like a particularly cowardly way to take the villain in, giving Hitch and Cole and easy way out and also makes Bragg seem particularly cowardly. Later, as the lawmen chase Bragg, his character changes until he becomes laughable.<br /><br />The action scenes in \\"Appaloosa\\" are good, but brief. And you have to wade through many minutes of poorly written exposition, keeping us away from the most interesting aspect of the film; the relationship between Cole and Hitch.th Ms. French.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|I watched the entire series without ever having seen the movies so I knew very little about what Terminator is about. The show was much better than I had expected. It took a little while to get a handle on the background but, once I had an idea of what was going on, I liked the show. I am ordering the DVDs for my boyfriend because he did not get to see the show and I know he will enjoy it just as much.
0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult did a great job in tieing together very deep issues while keeping the reader interested.  It is a book that many people especially ones with siblings can relate too.  There are two sisters in this novel Kate and Anna.  Kate is the oldest and is diagnosed with leukemia, so her parents decide to have another baby, Anna who hopefully will have the same blood type as Kate.  Throughout Anna's short life she is needed to keep Kate alive on multiple occasions.  Kate now needs a kidney to survive and Anna decides enough is enough and decides to get a lawyer to help her protect her body from her parents.    Some deep issues are formed in this novel.  Anna has basically been given life just to keep her sister, Kate alive, so is she now obligated to continue saving her?  Is Anna seen as a bad person for not saving her sister?  Picoult does a fantastic job in creating a serious family feud within Anna's family.  This is an awesome book and definately worth reading.

B000WC39SG|4.0|Nice reproduction.  It was originally filmed in great quality.  Not real sure if the Blue-ray version is that much better.  I viewed it on a 720p 42\\" LCD.  But the price made it worth it.
B00005JPS8|5.0|One of the Best Comic genre movies to date, coming close to the caliber of the Dark Knight (which hails as the best comic book movie of all time).  I'm not a big Robert Downy, Jr. fan but he nails it in this movie.  His interpretation of Tony Stark is the nearly the best coupling of actor to a comic book character yet; certainly better than Eric Bano's Bruce Banner. He even gets closer to his character than Christian Bale (which I have to say is the best Bruce Wayne to date)--and almost as accurate as Ledger's Joker (who could get that close?).  Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect Pepper Potts, which, as this is a supporting role for her, points to her professionalism as one of the upper echelon of actors.  Of course, Jeff Bridges' performance is equally impressive.  The CG is impressive and not overdone.  The story is very well written staying true to the Iron Man mythos.  This is well worth your time and money.
B001B71NOI|2.0|Following revolutionary works like ghosts and year zero, the slip brings nothing new to the table. For a band known to reinvent itself on every album, this one feels like a rehash.

B001CTDH4Y|4.0|My family members and I are making a movie called 'Pumpkin Man' (which I based my user name on.) On our free time My aunt, grandma and I went to see this. I thought this was very good and very funny! It's weird because my dad's sister's husband's mom has a chihuahua named Chloe, but she's had the name 6 years before this came out. After a spoiled rich Chihuahua becomes lost in Mexico, she has help from Delgado by trying to get back to Beverly Hills. Along the way, she figures out more about herself. If you love comedy and dogs, you'll love BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA!!!
B00004XPPC|5.0|Great W.W.2 movie. With William Holden a great actor. I sure do miss him. He puts these new actors to shame. Good movie for any war buff to add to his or hers collection.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I've always loved this film! It's like 'Carrie' for children. Usually once or twice a year, I find this on tv, so I watch it. I have it on vhs, but it's buried under my 7,000 movies. My aunt, uncle, and I watched this recently and they liked it also. They had never seen it. A smart, lonely girl named Matilda has a terrible family who hate her. When they finally let her go to school, she has a sweet sexy teacher named Miss Honey, and a mean principal named Miss Trunchbull. When Matilda is fed up with people mistreating her, she gains special powers where she can move things with her mind. It has an awesome cast, awesome plot, and awesome characters. It's also a childhood favorite. If you love family comedies, you'll love MATILDA!!!
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book. I thought it was an amazing ending to the series. If you were a fan of Edward and Bella all along you will be happy with the (spoiler alert) happy ending of the series. I was always team Edward and I thought this book had a lot of sweet, sad, and funny moments. I know a lot of people were disappointed with the big conflict war thing at the end of the book but come on could Stephenie really end the series with an all out brutal war where important characters die... don't think so. Read the book and give it a chance, I sure wasn't disappointed!
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This is more true to the comic and television series starring Bill Bixby.  I wasn't too thrilled with Liv Tyler being cast since Jennifer Connolly did a good job in Ang Lee's version of the Hulk.But The Incredible Hulk in this second go around,was more hulk very protective,of little words and wanting to be left alone.
B000003S5H|4.0|This is a very good CD of electronica.Great mix of vocal and instrumental  tunes.Generally uptempo and enjoyable.Recommended.
0743290119|2.0|I had issues with \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" but it was much more fun and original than this.  \\"Chasing Harry Winston\\" 's an ok read to kill time, but I found it aggravating how the characters are all perfect, beautiful, with great jobs and wonderful men ath their feet (that they don't seem particularly to appreciate). OK, chick-lit isn't meant to be realistic, but I really can't relate much to these kind of characters, I prefer Bridget Jones at this point.  Like some other reviewers pointed out, I too was bugged by Emmy's \\"Tour de Whore\\". People can do what they want with their bodies, but why should women be stigmatized because they're not into casual sex? I really don't see why poor Emmy should be treated like a freak because -gasp!-at 29 she's slept with only 3 men who were all serious boyfriends?

B000RJO578|5.0|Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg demonstrate brilliantly how to use cliches to create intelligent and hysterical comedy. Pegg and Frost are of course great on screen together; there are layers upon layers of reference, visual and verbal. Especially for those who grew up watching crime dramas and detective movies, you will experience a strange and wonderful sense of deja vu.
B001C08RHA|3.0|Good movie on all levels, but still a leftwing view of the U.S. military, and in that sense disappointing. Very uncreative, politically.
0446402389|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and I hope Mr. Smith writes more soon. If you liked this book then you will like the book Snow Wolf by Glenn Meade. It's a spy novel written in the mid 1990's--one of my favorite books. The two books are very similar in some ways even though one is basically a crime novel and the other a spy thriller.
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|Sorry, but I'm not going to try to convince myself that I like this CD just because it's been so long since AC/DC released an album and because I've been looking forward to it and because I've already spent the $11.88 and because Walmart has been hyping the crap out of it. IT'S LAME, the truth be told. Runaway Train is a pretty good song and at least halfway stands up to their old standards, but all the rest, ehh--sorry, the magic of yore just isn't there. The riffs and melodies just aren't catchy, plain and simple. You know, AC/DC could have retired in 1980 after Back In Black and still would have remained legends in rock and roll forever. Why they waited eight freakin' years to put out an album this lame is beyond me. Face it, fellow AC/DC fans, we got the short end of the stick on this one. And then 90 bucks to see them in concert?? You've got to be kidding. Shame on them! I thought AC/DC's fans were typically regular Joes, not Phantom of the Opera Broadway high falutin' snobs, who are the only ones who don't blink at forking over 90 bucks for a concert. THE MUSIC BUSINESS IS A BIG RACKET!
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I love this album. To me their stuff just keeps getting better. Their first album was ok for me. A little to country-fied for my taste. I liked a few songs off of it. Maybe they just grew on me, but I liked each album more than the previous one. The last two albums sound less and less like southern rock and more I guess you would call \\"mainstream\\". Some people might find fault with that, but it's fine with me. Quite a few of these songs are definitely rock anthems. But I love it. Put 'em in the middle of Giants stadium and crank it! This is definitely a must have for your collection if you liked their previous album. If you preferred their earlier music then you might be disappointed. Musically they are very tight and you can tell that they are very talented musicians. Must be great to see them live.
B00005JPO1|5.0|Memories are made of all these things. This is a masterpiece by Steven Spielperg, the only movie of the Indiana Jones series that can match the Raiders of the lost arc, the only one that successfuly transmits the spirit of adventure mixed with the nostalgia of a paradise lost, all present in the earlier Steven Spielberg films, the ones that weren't serious enough, the ones that were supposed to be just fun. By returning to his most famous hero, Spielberg goes back in time and unravels all his memories of an era that considers his own: the communist fear, the atomic bomb, the rock' n' roll, all slide gently in a film of great wisdom, where the old generation gives his place to the new generation, and where Spielberg is the father and the child for once. After experiencing an excellent but also deliberately old fashioned adventure, there comes the closing time: the hat that flies, the young one that holds it in his hands, and the old one that takes it back because it is HIS hat. The young one, if he wants, may go and make something of his own. This could be the last Stieven Spielberg film (I don' t say that it will be), a great farewell to us all, to all these things that memories are made of, to the world, and after this Indiana Jones passes to immortality. For the sake of all things we once loved: Indiana Jones for ever!
B001FBSMW6|4.0|When I first listened to the album I was a little thrown off by the album. It sounds nothing like Hopes and Fears or Under the Iron Sea, but it does have its own distinct quality. I don't think this sounds like pop 80's once you give it a few listens. The album grew on me a lot since I originally heard it all the way through. If you don't like it just try it a few more times and see if doesn't do the same for you.    Black Burning Heart, Love is the End, and Time to Go are all songs similar to previous Keane albums.
0375423877|3.0|Again, this book was chosen for one of my bookclubs and this one is ok. It's not the world's greatest nor a thought-provoking read. This book fits the bill of snuggling under the blanket on a cold autumn day and read of the hot desert air in Africa. This is not a typical mystery either. It is a pleasant rambling of life in Africa. It is also a very predictable mystery book (I wouldn't even call it a mystery novel).     This book is the first in the series (which I probably won't read the rest) and it is about a woman named Precious who opened up a business and she is a detective. She looks for straying husbands, lost kids, and other cases. This book is a jumble of several cases where she finds the answer very easily. It is a cute book but again, very predictable.    This is perfect for those cold days when you have time to read a book in its entirety. If you like Agatha Christie novels, you will like this one.     10/22/08
B00068TJM6|4.0|Bought this at Macy's for $500 and it was worth it. Its a beautiful heavy watch that I have enjoyed for about 3.5 years now. The face will scratch if you hit it hard enough and sand and grit can get under the rotating bezel if you arent careful, but it hasnt affected the operation of the watch in any way. If you treat it like a piece of jewelry it will last forever, I kind of treat my things like theyre swissarmy knives. It still works just as good but it doesnt quite look as good as it did. I meant to give the watch 5stars and I cant change it now for some reason but it does deserve 5. (the sand eventually ground away and the bezel rotates just as smoothly as it ever did)
0375826726|5.0|I have been waiting for this book to be published for at least three years, and I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed.  This book explores deeper into the minds of the characters and their pasts, and solves many of the problems that were left in Eldest, while creating new, more difficult ones along the way as well.       One of the best things about this book, though, is that the characters become more realistic than the boring, emotionless things that were walking around in the other two books.  Arya CRIES, for goodness sakes!  And SAPHIRA HAS HER OWN POINT OF VIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I loved seeing Saphira as a main character with thoughts, feelings, and ideas of her own instead of her being Eragon's wise sidekick for 600 pages, like the other two books.       The middle of the book does get a bit boring, and Roran's point of view is pointless, since all he does is think about Katrina, worry about Katrina, and feel sorry for all the people he killed.  Um, hello, if you decide you're going to fight for the Varden, just get over your fears and fight!        In the Eragon and Eldest, Eragon is taught everything by old, smart people.  In this book, Eragon learns to fend for himself and teaches himself many good life lessons along the way. Over all, Brisingr is a great fantasy book for all to enjoy.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I use to read some discussion boards as this when buying discs, then download them and then buy them if I like what I hear and with this album it was the same. I had never heard anything about the \\"loudness war\\" some people discussed related to this and other albums and was very reluctant to buy it from that point (and to be honest, the works of Metallica since Load and all forthcoming albums until this one). Then I downloaded it from the internet and my first impression was Whoa!... welcome back, guys!  My girlfriend bought me the album as an anniversary present and I have to say both impressions were right: the songs and the general work of the album is great, the riffs, the choruses, the solos, even the drumming improved a lot since St. Anger, but the low point in this one really is the mixing. There are some points in which this \\"loudness\\" is quite imperceptible, but then there are a lot of spots in many songs in which it becomes nearly annoying (say at the end of the single \\"the day that never comes\\" and in the rythm drums in almost all songs) you can hear a \\"not nice distortion\\" and a loudness that is not the one Lemmy Kilmister asks when he says \\"play it loud!\\". So, as a summary, Music: five stars. Crappy mixing: five stars (or 1 star on good mixing).
B000001FKY|4.0|Hysteria isn't my favorite Def Leppard album (I rank Pyromania #1 and High N Dry #2) but it's impossible to deny the impact or popularity the band achieved with this release. There are a ton of great hit songs on here, and no Def Leppard collection should be without Hysteria. My favorite tracks include: Women, Rocket, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Hysteria, Armageddon It, and Love Bites.
B0019OP0GU|4.0|It was a nice story, just a little slow to make its point. The girls were great actresses, and Emma Watson proved she can act as something besides Hermoine Granger, kudos for her. The redhead was also very good... especially in the scene when she's crying because her teacher died and won't be able to teach her anymore. The brunette was also superb... her character was my favorite. The only downside was the \\"father\\"... his character was hardly convincing. I mean... who disappears for 12 years and suddenly return just in time? Maybe I had to read the book to understand it. Either way, great movie.
B000001F7R|3.0|There are two things I hear about On Through The Night, Def Leppard's debut, that I disagree with. One is that it doesn't sound like Def Leppard. To me it sounds like them 100% - maybe a little more raw and fueled by youth, but still the same band that made High N Dry and (replacing Pete with Phil) Pyromania. The other thing that I disagree with is that this is a heavy metal album. This is nowhere near the style of Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, who I would consider the \\"NWOBM\\" of this era. Yes, OTTN is heavier and less pop than anything that followed, but it still sounds like Def Leppard's instantly recognizable brand of hook-laden arena rock with a big sound and sing-along vibe. Elliot hasn't quite got that ultralayered harmony going, so his vocals sound, well... not quite as full or high, but his voice is up to par for these songs. Pete's guitar style is also more aggressive than his replacement's, which adds to the attack of this album.

0375826726|2.0|Wow.  This book is actually much worse than the first two.  I liked the first one, tolerated the second, and now can't believe how bad this one is.  It drags on, the plot moves slowly, and the characters are about as unengaging as I have ever seen.  Eragon needs a real girlfriend, not a platonic dragon, or a frigid, unattainable elf.  Blah.  If I read one more paragraph with him mooning over one or the other, I am going to barf.  All of his female characters in general need work.  They are more two dimensional than anybody else in the whole book.  For the most part, they are either simpering foolish creatures who serve to highlight the masculinity of his macho male characters, or they are sexless, distant, alien beings that are about what you would expect from a writer raised at home, who really, really needs to get out more often.  And his battle scenes are a pathetic joke.  Please.  The guy with the warhammer standing on a 20 foot tall mound of bodies, single-handedly killing almost 200 people, as they wander towards him one at a time to be slaughtered?  Are you serious?  How exactly do you get them to fall neatly into a pile like that?  And how do you stay on top of this ever-growing mound?  Does the author have any idea exactly how many bodies it would take to make a 20 foot tall mound?  Significantly more than his character would be able to smite in a day, much less the short time it takes to fight this battle.  And then, of course, the hero gets flogged for disobeying his commanding officer during the course of his heroic battle.  Where does he get this idiocy from?  I am not even going to go into how badly the dwarves are written.    One of my other problems with this book is the author's backpedaling on some of the stances he took in the previous books.  Notably on vegetarianism and religion.  In the first two books, the wise, all-knowing (and very over-the-top stereotypical) elves convince him that eating meat is bad for moral reasons, and that there is noGod/Gods and no afterlife.  Eragon accepts this as the truth.  The dwarves, who have their own pantheon of deities, are portrayed as being religious, superstitious nut jobs who refuse to see the enlightened truth of Atheism, as presented by the elves.  In this book, Paolini tries to win back many of the readers he alienated by taking these stances by first having Eragon rediscover the joys of meat, and then meeting a dwarven God.  Can you say pandering boys and girls?  I enjoy a good steak as much as anybody.  And I was annoyed at how preachy the author was about these two topics in the first couple of books.  But to do such an obvious flip flop on one of the key tenants of his character's belief structure just to win back a few readers is really sad.     My final complaint is about the dragon.  And some of the scenes where she is thinking to herself.  Paolini uses a pathetic hyphenated-word-cluster format for describing the world as she sees it.  So the sun is fire-that-burns-in-the-sky, and the polluted river is brown-water-not-for-drinking.  Where did that brilliant idea come from?  What, the dragon hasn't been able to handle simple nouns?  Everything has to be referred to in her mind as a bunch of descriptive terms tacked together?  Again, BLAH!  Had this novel been written when he was 15, I would cut him a bit of slack.  But he is what?  25 now?  He needs to either figure out how to write again, or turn the series over to a ghostwriter.  That is, assuming of course, that the series survives this latest piece of garbage.    -CR
B00001U0DP|5.0|I thought this was a touching and wonderfully creative film. Part comedy, part tragedy, \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is a fictional tale that tackles an incredibly difficult subject, but does so primarily through omission.    Some reviewers criticize this movie as little more than \\"garbage\\" or even as \\"obscene\\" because it does not depict the raw horrors of the Holocaust. While I disagree with the negative assessments, this much is true: When you watch this film, you will not see the stark, brutal hell endured by the victims of Nazi evil - but that is precisely the point of this particular story. The horrors are left out by design.    \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" relates the story of Guido and his family through the eyes of his innocent young son, Joshua. It is assumed that we - the viewers - are already aware of what happened in that place and time. We know what the Nazis were doing; we know about the atrocities they committed and the plans they had for the Jewish people. But the point of the film is that Joshua never does!    In the movie, Guido protects his son by disguising - and yes, as an earlier reviewer wrote, he \\"sugar coats\\" - the terrible things they encounter while in Nazi hands. Through Guido's efforts, deportation becomes a \\"trip\\" for young Joshua, and internment in the camp becomes a \\"game\\". None of these things is ever a game for Guido or the other adults in the film, but they are always seen that way by the child.     It is precisely the lack of horror in Joshua's experience that allows him to cope and, ultimately, to survive with his innocence in tact - an outcome made possible only through the terrific ingenuity of his loving and fiercely protective father. The closing lines of the film, spoken by Joshua, sum it up very nicely: \\"This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This was his gift to me.\\"    \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is a fictional tale with a Holocaust theme, but it is not all-encompassing. It does not seek to detail every horror of the Holocaust; itis not a historical survey of the event and does not pretend to be an educational resource. Not every Holocaust story can relate every aspect or every detail of what happened, but - like this one - not all are intended to.    I recommend this film to everyone, but urge that viewers take it for what it is: one unique story from one unique perspective.

159562015X|5.0|This book is an easy read. The main purpose of buying this book is to access their latest version of the online test (Strength Finder 2.0) so that you can discover what your potential talents are.<br /><br />I must admit that I read through quickly through Tom Rath's argument about the benefits on focusing on your strength because I have already sold to this idea presented by Marcus Buckingham in the book [[ASIN:0743201140 Now, Discover Your Strengths]] (also includes access to Strength Finder 1.0).<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Marcus Bukingham's presentation. For readers who did not read the previous book by Marcus Buckingham, this is a chance to explore the reasons on the benefits of focusing on your strengths instead of weaknesses. I would rate a 3 star on the arguments on strength focus.<br /><br />For the online test Strength Finder 2.0, this new version is much better than the previous one and the result presents a more comprehensive analysis on your top five potential talents. I would rate a 5 star for the online test.<br /><br />I would recommend everyone who desire a better self awareness to take this test. A lot of you may think that you already know your strengths; some of you may consider yourself a talent in numbers, computer, people, music etc. This test, however, presents to you in a different way that explains your strength. Your strength in computer, numbers, music or science is just a manifestation of your top 5 talent. In another word, this test explains to you why you are good in numbers, music, or people. For example, I love to read and I am good in research. The reason why I love to read and why I am good in research is due to a talent called \\"learner\\". By knowing your underlying talents also open opportunities for developing other strengths that you might potentially have.<br /><br />After I took the test one and a half years ago, I was quite skeptical about most of my top 5 talent. After months of introspection and observation, I began to discover evidences from the past and present that supports my top 5 talents. I am now convinced that I possess the quality of my top 4 talents describe in the test. I am still trying to find evidences that support my possession of the fifth talent. This also concurs to the saying that it is difficult to know about yourself without external feedback because you tend to ignore the qualities that you naturally own.<br /><br />One final word of advice for those who like to take the test is to answer the questions from your heart. The quality of the result depends on how honest and truthful you are about who you are. Do not answer the question in the test by anticipating the correct answer. There is no right or wrong answer.<br /><br />Some of you might prefer to know the complete ranking of all your talent. I think this defeat the basic principle on focusing on your strength. Personally, I think knowing your top 3 potential talent is good enough to make a difference in your life if you focus all your effort in developing them.  This revelation of my potentials has greatly increased my self esteem and confidence. I urge those readers who are affected by the current economic condition to take the opportunity to know thyself and find out what other potential talents you possess that you are not even aware.<br /><br />(updated review in May 2009)present that supports my top 5 talents.

0385751532|4.0|I found this book very interesting because you see a war in the eyes of a kid who knows nothing. The author uses a teqnique wich called my attention, he says everything and at the same time nothing. You just guess a lot of things, I don't know how to say it though.   Just wanted to say: buy it, it's a woderful purchase and you won't be ble to put it down.    A bad thing: too short, perhaps.
0321127420|5.0|Motivation<br /><br />I didn't look at this book for a long time simply because of the word \\"enterprise.\\" I felt the word was too overloaded to be useful. I've heard too many managers, recruiters, and other programmers use this word to mean too many different things. Fowler defines enterprise application as \\"the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of business process with that data.\\" By that definition every system I've ever worked on has been an enterprise application.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />A dense, tough read. I almost wish I was at a whiteboard or kept a notepad while reading.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Fowler gives a fantastic presentation of how to design software using databases, distributed components, etc. This is given through good narratives and anecdotes of Fowler's own experiences, and also through the patterns distilled from these.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this book is I would put it fourth in the list of books-I'd-like-anybody-I'm-working-with-to-have-read, right after to Design Patterns, Refactoring, and Extreme Programming Explained.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />As with most patterns books, not everything in here is an amazing revelation, but the common approach, terminology, and ways of categorizing problems and solutions make it very valuable.<br /><br />Programmers who utilize design patterns and refactoring, and who work on software systems involving distributed components and/or databases should take a look at this book.
B000HKCRW2|3.0|Musically The Rapture is a breath of fresh air.  Good non-electronic dance music is a rarity these days. (not that I dislike electronic music)  Unfortunately, buying this was a complete waste of money for me.  The album is full of profanity including the f-bomb multiple times.  I often listen to music with family including my kids.  There is no way I would play this.  This really should have had an explicit lyrics warning on it.  I guess I should have done more research.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|The original modern BATMAN with Michael Keaton remains one of my favorite comic book action movies. Although it has some humorous parts it is basically a drama. BATMAN FOREVER is much more tongue-in-cheek, tries to be much more witty, and succeeds much of the time. Val Kilmer is OK as Bruce Wayne and Batman, but Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are just out of their minds good as the evil nemeses of society and Batman. So much so that it almost becomes their movie, with Batman finding his new partner, Robin (Chris O'Connell), a circus trapeze performer, as almost a side story. Nicole Kidman, as we have become accustomed, is just perfect as Wayne's love interest.  I don't rate this film very highly, probably \\"7\\" on a 10-point scale, but with a very aggressive sound track, and really vile villians, it is entertaining if you like the genre.

B0013ND30M|4.0|What?  Disney's released another two-disc edition of \\"Sleeping Beauty?\\"  Why, pray tell?  Because they can?  Because poor Disney-addicted saps like myself will fall for the ruse and pony up more of our hard-earned cash, even though we already own the Special Edition that was released a mere five years ago?  You can tell I was skeptical.  But there are some wonderful new extras on this release that weren't included in the last, and for hardcore fans, they're definitely worth having.  And the film itself...?  Well, for those of you who have never seen \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" by all means snatch it up.  This may not be Disney's most entertaining film in terms of story line, but it's certainly one of its most visually gorgeous.  The look of the film is based on ancient tapestries and medieval artwork, and the way that the studio's animators and background artists have translated them to the screen (led by the brilliant, visionary Eyvind Earle), is nothing less than breathtaking.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to any edition of \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" and it's not necessarily a small one, is that the scope of the film, its visual, widescreen beauty and impact will be completely lost on a conventionally sized television.  If you don't have a big screen TV, it's almost not worth the investment.<br /><br />So, if you have the old edition of the film, try selling it on Amazon and put the money towards getting the new one.  If you don't have either, just be aware that the size of your set may seriously effect (or enhance) your enjoyment of this most beautiful and unique of Disney's masterpieces.

B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens is the successful sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Alien, and sets the tone for a multitude of future science fiction films.  Moving away from the horror genre of Alien, Aliens is a pretty straightforward action film, full of violence and colorful dialogue, which certainly won't disappoint most viewers.  Being a follow-up to a film like Alien Director James Cameron made sure to make this his film and not reuse concepts from the ground breaking original.  That being said, however, some of Cameron's changes do cause the aliens to lose their mysterious nature that we were presented with in the first film, but I'll be back with more on that in just a second.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the first film's lead female character, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and how she goes back to the planet where she first encountered the alien that killed off her crew.  Having been in cryo-sleep for decades a lot of things have changed, such as her daughter dying of old age.  Ripley doesn't seem to have much to live for anymore so she goes along with the operation when contact with a local colony is lost.  Escorted by the marines, she encounters the only survivor, a girl by the name of `Newt'.  Having just lost her own daughter, Ripley quickly bonds to the child.  Of course this wouldn't be Aliens if everything didn't go wrong, and soon all the characters are fighting for their lives (and quickly losing).  Ripley must step up to the challenge and confront her fears once again.<br /><br />Aliens is probably my favorite film in the series, due to high levels of action, colorful characters, and memorable scenes, but do I think it's better than Alien?  No, I most certainly do not think that this film tops the work of Ridley Scott.  I love James Cameron's work, and Aliens, but his film is not as well made as Scott's first film, even if I do enjoy Cameron's film more.  A key issue I find with Aliens is the liberties Cameron took on the species, which in so doing, destroys their mystery.<br /><br />In Alien we were presented with a terrifying creature that was quite frightening.  This creature crawled, and moved across the Nostromo with great elegance, and was always able to catch its victims by surprise, often showing an advanced level of intelligence.  Driven by its survival instincts this animal did whatever it took to survive, while also showing curiosity (examining the cat, but not harming it, and not attacking Ripley upfront in the escape pod).  In Cameron's action-packed sequel most of these aspects of the species are lost.  The first hive scene, seeing the aliens come out of the walls which they had blended into so very well, was in the nature of the first film, but after that they lose most of the nature of the sleek skinned alien of Scott's film, and came across as having the inteligence of your typical pack animal.  They're noisy, they swarm, exhibit very little intelligence and just lose a lot of their \\"scare factor.\\"  In this film the aliens are like zombies; there's a lot of them, they swarm, get blown to bits in mass to the cheers of audience members (honestly, you know the zombie genre is popular because people love seeing mass quantities of things blown up in gruesome fashions).  The Alien Queen is probably just as iconic as the original \\"drone\\" class of the species, but Cameron's \\"ant hive\\" structure just doesn't seem to fit in as well with what we saw exhibited in the first film of the franchise.  It's just too simple, and well... down to earth.  I don't think if there had been a hive full of Scott's aliens that they would've simply run headlong into gunfire, because in the first film the species was shown as being something that would do ANYTHING to survive and multiply.<br /><br />Okay, critic time is over, and I must say that the hive structure does work out very nicely in this film, and the aliens look great, especially the queen.  The action is intense, but never really frightened me for a second.  The action is very well shot; Cameron having just shot The Terminator knew how to do entertaining action sequences.<br /><br />This is my favorite film in the franchise, and it is that way for most viewers, but I can't bring myself to say it is on par with the greatness of Scott's Alien.  Aliens comes pretty dang close to besting it, but in the end it comes down the atmosphere, and Scott's film had it more so than Cameron's.  I will always love Aliens, and will never deny it as my favorite film in this series, but Alien was a film that ultimately had everything needed to become a classic.<br /><br />I give Aliens a strong 5/5aving just shot The Terminator knew how to do entertaining action sequences.

If a reader were to read only the first half of this book, they may have a more positive impression of this book then it is worthy of.<br /><br />However, this book is an utter disappointment because it never reaches a conclusion. I feel like Mr. Gladwell started this book in support of the unconscious mind as a powerful, accurate decision making force; and as he researched further, grew less sure of this position, until near the end of the book he warns us against relying on the unconscious  At the very end, it's apparent that the author doesn't really know where he stands on this topic, and in the afterward, the reader is ping-ponged back and forth as Mr. Gladwell argues with himself.<br /><br />His final conclusion that he leaves us with--that juries should not be allowed to view a defendant in person--flies in the face of other research that he presents earlier in the book--that the unconscious mind is able to pick up on \\"micro-expressions\\" that reveal obscured emotions and motivations.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell is clearly unable to make a decision on this topic, and that only leaves his readers ultimately confused.

But when it came to the fights, the detail was much appreciated. The storyline and development of each character has really been expanded. Each turn of events led to another self-realization. I loved this book from beginning to end and I just cannot wait for the final book of Inheritance.

B0006HC0I2|5.0|Jean Gabin has always been my favorite actor (he should be; I wrote a book about him -- WORLD'S COOLEST MOVIE STAR), and this is really the consummate 'later period' Gabin movie.<br /><br />Most Americans know Jean Gabin only from a handful of films which he made in the '30s, his \\"matinee idol\\" period when he played movie history's consummate tragic drifter.  But in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, he played the ultimate 'classy' gentleman-gangster -- a definite progenitor of Vito Corleone -- and director Jacques Becker's \\"Touchez pas au grisbi\\" (\\"Hands of the Loot\\") knocks it out of the park.  If you like French noir movies like \\"Rififi\\" and \\"Bob Le Flambeur,\\" this picture is just as wonderful.<br /><br />Aside from the requisite action sequences, director Jacques Becker (Renoir's A.D. on \\"Les Bas-fonds,\\" \\"La Grande illusion,\\" and \\"La Bete humaine\\") wisely alternates the action with some finely nuanced scenes between the characters, scenes which really make them genuine and 'real' to the viewer.<br /><br />I can't recommend Touches pas au grisbi\\" highly enough.  It should be part of every serious cineaste's DVD collection.

0307387151|4.0|For starters: I've never read any McEwan before, and generally do not care for modern writers, but I was absolutely floored by his prose.  The writing is amazing.    His portrayal of naive, pre-teen Briony is dead-on and eerie, and, even though she is far less developed, I could identify some with Cecelia's feelings of being a bit lost and out-of-place at home after the relative independence of college.    I've read a lot of reviews that are impatient with the slow pace, especially of the first part of the novel.  While I agree that it is a novel that immerses the reader fully in descriptions, I think such criticism is a little unfair.  It is not a novel that should be read in anticipation of getting to a juicy ending; it's a novel that should be read with the mindset that getting there is half (most of) the enjoyment.    While I didn't especially *like*, or closely identify with, any of the characters, I thought they were reasonable (I don't like most real, live, people that much, either).  I didn't think Briony was horrible so much as she was ignorant, confused, and self-centered, as are most 13-year-olds; I include myself in that, as embarrassing as it is to remember it.   I thought she was an excellent characterization of an adolescent at an awkward place in life, with an incomplete view and as-yet poor understanding of the world.    The ending was complicated.  No, I don't think anything she did later could actually atone for the mess Briony made.  On the other hand, she was 13 and acting out of ignorance more than viciousness.  And, frankly, I thought the title referred more at her attempt to atone to herself, to lay her conscience to rest, than to actually achieving any sort of atonement in the eyes of the rest of the world.  I think it should not be taken too literally.
B000TGJ80S|2.0|Ok the movie is good but...an oscar? Who did they pay off? This movie had potential and some parts of it were good but an Oscar should go to something that would be considered a timeless classic. I had a hard time even finishing it to be honest and I WANTED it to be good.   This is a serious case of artistic license taken WAY too far. The main character was well played and well done and there are some really good parts but overall it felt rather spliced together and lacked any sort of \\"epic\\" feel to it. More like watching one sound bite after another. It felt like it got directed by someone who was trying to make a music video.If your looking for a truly good Vampire saga do yourself a favor and watch Interview with a Vampire. Give this one a skip unless your really bored. Its sad too cause this had some of my favorite actors.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|The first thing you'll notice is that there are no giant poodles in \\"The Incredible Hulk\\". That's a good thing. While Ang Lee's first film had merit, it was flawed and we won't even discuss the silliness factor of a trio of giant dogs attacking Hulk in that film. Director Louis Leterrier's film manages to be both a smashing action film AND a bit of character study returning unashamedly to the comic book roots of the character. This is a fun popcorn flick with really good performances.<br /><br />The opening titles of the film give us a recap of how Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) became the Hulk ignoring the more complex origin of Lee's film. We catch up with Banner in South America working in a soda factory and working on a cure with the help of \\"Mr. Blue\\" a researcher in the United States. All it takes is a drop of blood in a contaminated soda bottle for General Ross (William Hurt) to locate Banner who he considers to be government property. Putting Blodsky (Tim Roth) a Russian born British soldier in charge of the retrieval, Ross and his team try and take Banner only to have him Hulk out on them.<br /><br />When \\"Mr. Blue\\" suggests that if he had all the data he might have a cure for him, Bruce Banner visits the only person that would have it--Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). Unfortunately for Banner, General Ross manages to track him down and sents a genetically altered Blodsky after Banner with destructive results.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with great picture quality. In fact it's so good that you can see some scenes that should have been rendered in CGI a bit better than they were but weren't because of budget constraints. Nevertheless, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is a step up visually from Ang Lee's film from 2003 with Eric Bana with a ribbed but more realistic looking Hulk and his foe Abomination. The final showdown between the two of them combines CGI and miniature work nearly seamlessly.<br /><br />The extras include about 40 minutes of deleted/edited scenes including an alternate opening where Bruce treks to the Arctic and, supposedly, if you look really carefully you can see Captain America buried in the ice just before Banner Hulks out. The deleted scenes are in 480i.<br /><br />We also get a number of cool featurettes including two that show how they used motion capture and the actors to create their CGI counterparts in the film. There's also a \\"Making of\\" featurette (sponsered by Volkswagon!), a dossier that gives us information on the characters, picture-in-picutre (courtesy of Ucontrol)that allows you to compare scenes from the comic book that inspired scenes in the film as well as animatics and storyboards. The Blu-ray Live feature is also enabled for this disc so if you have a Playstation 3 you can go on line to discuss the film, etc. There's also a digital version of the film that you can load on to your PC and into iTunes or a Windows player if you so choose.<br /><br />\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" may lack the angst of Ang Lee's film \\"Hulk\\" but it does make up for that lack of angst with a load of action. It's a pity that we didn't get the theatrical cut and Edward Norton's more character driven version as well on this set as that might have rivaled Lee's film in that department. It's hard to tell from the deleted scenes included here simply because they aren't integrated into the film. A lot were cut for good reason while some would have given the film additional depth.<br /><br />\\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is a very good action flick that could have used a bit more character depth but even as presented it's a fun piece of entertainment that almost equals \\"Iron Man\\".e treks to the Arctic and, supposedly, if you look really carefully you can see Captain America buried in the ice just before Banner Hulks out.

1400034205|3.0|It's not really about one man's search for transcendence.  It's more about everyone else's reaction to him.  The whole search is covered in Chapter Six, which is all you need to read if you are into the eastern philosophy in the book.   Maugham starts the chapter off by saying you don't have to read it at all.  But that's only if you're interested in the Paris Hiltons of the day.  Very dull stuff, no matter how accurate and well-written in the style in use then -- Maugham's style involves a lot more \\"telling\\" than we are used to nowadays, and a lot more overt misogyny.  He was homosexual, although his portrait of the shallow \\"old cissie\\" in the book is equally unkind.

1416594884|3.0|Mr. Le Carre used to be an excellent writer. Many of his books, like the George Smiley series, or \\"The Perfect Spy\\" are true masterpieces. Regrettably, this latest effort is not up to par.    \\"The Most Wanted Man\\" is not nearly as well written as many of Mr. Le Carre's earlier works and the ending, I'm afraid, is a disappointment. The athor devotes the entire book to a slow, \\"Le Carre-esque\\", elaborate development of his spy story. Not bad at all, even though his writing is not at its best (which is still better than most out there). Then, unexpectedly, at the end, a bunch of stupid throat-cutter Americans suddenly barge in into the the clever, humane intelligence operation... and do their brutal thing... and everything ends badly, and people get hurt. Makes you hate the SOB's, doesn't it.    The book's ending is almost like a copout. Instead of ending it, he kills it.    Le Carre always had an anti-American streak, but by now it's almost hatred - and the redeeming values are fewer and further between. I'm tempted to suggest to the readers to stop a few pages before the ending. It stinks.    One star off for the less than best effort, and another one - for the ending.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch is a metal band that definitely lives up to their name, and their 2007 debut album &#34;The Way of the Fist&#34; is simply one of the best new metal albums that I've had the pleasure of listening to. This album is truly like a swift punch in the face from beginning to end. I got this album on Best Buy.com back in September, and I definitely got my dollars worth, and I instantly fell in love with it, and I became of fan of 5FDP as well. Five Finger Death Punch is a heavy metal band that consists of vocalist Ivan Moody (formerly of Motograter), guitarist Zoltan Bathory, bassist Matt Snell, as well as former W.A.S.P. members in guitarist Darrell Roberts and drummer Jeremy Spencer, and these guys truly prove to be in absolute top form as musicians on here. They definitely remind me a lot of Pantera because they're very heavy and aggressive at times, but they also have a great melodic side as well. The lyrics are strong, and very powerful, the choruses are very catchy and moving, and of course each song on here is flat out amazing and addicting. Ivan Moody has an excellent vocal range. I really like how he can go from powerful, aggressive screams and shouts, and switch to nice, strong, clean melodic vocals. The guitar work by Zoltan and Darrell is very impressive on here. The riffs are catchy, heavy, energetic, and headbanging worthy, and there's also some great, memorable solos on here as well. Matt has some great bass lines, and Jeremy does a solid, splendid job on the drums, and he can also slam the double bass like nobody else's business.<br /><br />Here's a look at my favorite songs.<br /><br />The first track &#34;Ashes&#34; is a solid, fast heavy opener and one of the best songs on here that features solid, slamming double bass kicking, heavy, thumping drum beats, fast surging riffs including a fantastic guitar solo, angry heart pumping vocals, and a great melodic chorus to boot. The title cut is another great heavy hitter as well as one of my personal favorites that is highlighted by aggressive, commanding vocals from Ivan, more fast, energy infused, heart pumping riffs, slamming double bass assaults, an addicting energetic shout along chorus, and some nice catchy melodic guitar leads. The third track &#34;Salvation&#34;, is another huge favorite of mine that features more powerful screaming vocals, another great melodic sung chorus, strong, fast, chugging riffage, and a nice melodic guitar solo as well. This was also the first 5FDP song that I ever heard before as well. Track four &#34;The Bleeding&#34; (the album's first single) is an awesome ballad type song that also has it's heavy and angry parts. There's also another great solo as well as great mix of singing/screaming vocals from Ivan to boot. Another one of my favorites, track seven &#34;White Knuckles&#34; is highlighted by more hot catchy, chugging, energy infused riffs, heavy pounding drum beats, angry, commanding screams, and there's also another awesome, killer solo as well. Track ten and the album closer &#34;Meet the Monster&#34; is a solid, energetic closer that features another fantastic mix of screaming/singing from Ivan along with lean and mean grinding riffs, and a driving, pounding mid tempo drum beat that's downright catchy and hypnotic. Overall, there's not even one bad song on here, seriously they all rule especially the three bonus tracks &#34;Never Enough&#34;, &#34;Stranger Than Fiction&#34;, and the acoustic version of &#34;The Bleeding&#34; is perfect as well. Please read on for the song ratings.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Ashes (3:44) - 5/5<br />2. The Way of the Fist (3:58) - 5/5<br />3. Salvation (3:20) - 5/5<br />4.

Like I said before, &#34;The Way of the Fist&#34; is like a swift punch in the face, and Five Finger Death Punch deliver it with such power and passion, and this album definitely proves it.

B001FBSMW6|1.0|Listen, I love Keane.  Love them.  I listen to their first two albums all the time.  And while I understand artists need to \\"grow\\" and discover new sounds, this is nothing more than a bad 80's electronica album.  If you want to use the \\"flavor of the week\\" snyths like everyone else, at least make it catchy.  I want my $10 back.
B000VI70WM|5.0|Perhaps I am a little late with this review, yet I just dicovered this little gem last summer and it has finally revealed its worth! It is priceless. I have been buying Duran albumns since 1982. They just keep getting better. The problem with music reviews is time. Most of the bad reviews were posted within a month of the records release. It is obviously,something that should be savored. These people who post negative reviews should delete them or revise them.     This disc is dark even for the \\"Durans\\". Most of their work has various criticism of the world we live on. This one sums up the very culture that has swallowed itself. Sort of like \\"Saturn eating his children\\". Why does Justin Timberlake have to be on every one's record? I feel the track he wrote is the weakest! He is just a footnote for the theme of the record! Commercialism, hype, tabloids, and paparazzi. Need I say more?       Enter a band that has been around within those flashbulbs for years. At least they look great in it! I am one of those rare male Duran fans who like the music, no matter who is in the band. There are a few tracks that could be skipped. Yet the good ones, may be some of the best the band has ever offered! Basically the second half of the recording is flawless from \\"Tempted\\" on!     Frightning, electronic dance tracks infest this classic \\"Duran\\" fare. I particularly love \\"She's Too Much\\". It is the brightest moment on the disc. Indeed, as the music industry grinds to a halt, Duran Duan may be the \\"Last Man Standing\\"!

B000002MG1|5.0|Luis Mejia - Automatic For The People is definitively one of the most selected pieces of magic popcraft throughout the 90s'; and undoubtly alternative kings R.E.M. most famous work. From beginning to end this album is beautiful and rewarding; the witty introduction in \\"Drive\\", the wimsical cult of the nearly fading \\"Nightswimming\\", and many other moments cut the album accessible but yet very significative. A 90s' top choice, represented by swifting soft but accute passages of music, lyrical interest and refreshing cohersion; but even for the matter, R.E.M. mainstream hardy tone on their music it's not gone but transformed into a laid back mood. Take a few good listens, as it is a very sensitive album, and anyone can feel identified with the apathic feelings of \\"Ignoreland\\", the craftmanship of \\"Man On The Moon\\", the playfulness in \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight\\", the scattered original passages, and of course, the spawning, massive hit \\"Everybody Hurts\\", one of the most well known and best arranged ballads.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|This might be overstating the obvious, but this is a must have companion to the first Twin Peaks t.v. soundtrack album. This has a ton of great stuff like \\"Just You\\"(sung by James Marshall from the show, with back ups by Sheryl Lee and Lara Flynn Boyle), \\"Hook Rug Dance\\" ,and \\"Blue Frank\\". The material ranges from 50's type stuff, to eerie jazz and lounge, to eerier ambient, as is to be expected from Lynch/Badalamenti. Obviously those already fans who have some context for the music will enjoy this more, but really, this is good enough for anyone to enjoy. But speaking as one previously initiated, I can't get enough of this stuff. I wish there was another album somewhere with more of these gems from the show. Sad, beautiful, creepy and perfect for late night listening.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Shelter was a wonderful movie. Although a low budget independent production, the writing and acting was great.

0380725398|4.0|Daphne du Maurier's 1936 JAMAICA INN reads much like the portions of WUTHERING HEIGHTS told in Isabella's letter, or that concern Cathy Linton's stay at the house later in the novel: like Heathcliff, the menacing antihero Joss Merlyn glowers and threatens, and storms in fury at the young heroine (here his niece, Mary Yellan). But Du Maurier's Heathcliff is mixed with quite a bit of Hindley Earnshaw besides, and shares the latter's weakness and fondness for drink... making him vulnerable to his own wagging tongue, which exposes to his niece his horrible and unforgivable crimes which are all part of his business.    The comparisons to Emily Brontë's only novel may seem invidious, given that Mary Yellan can be no Catherine Earnshaw (nor Joss Merlyn no Heathcliff), and that some of the plot twists in this novel seem telegraphed a bit too readily. Du Maurier, a lifelong Brontë enthusiast, tried to match the  famous Haworth sisters again with her next novel, REBECCA, which is in effect a writing of JANE EYRE... and there she came closer to succeeding. But JAMAICA INN is a marvelous Gothic in its own right, and even had Du Maurier never written another novel after it she would still be famous for the achievement of this work. It beautifully showcases her great gift of narrative description, which was probably unmatched among other realist English novelists since Hardy. Mary Yellan's first night among her uncle's sinister cohorts (climaxing in her remarkable vision of a menacing rope end) is a tour de force, as is her encounter with her husband's work on a stormy Christmas eve. This is a book hard to put down, and it remains one of Du Maurier's most memorable.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This album rock. I mean all songs here are mostly good. Loud great sounds metallica brings to you great music. Sounds on here that's what makes them the best at what they do very well. Like it sounds like an older metallica.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|In 2007, New Jersey's the Gaslight Anthem became a hugely buzzed band in the punk scene, owing in part to their fiery live shows, and in part to their fantastic debut record [[ASIN:B00136CDNC Sink Or Swim]]. Now, a year later, following an interim EP ([[ASIN:B0013NFPKS Senor and the Queen]]) released earlier in the year, the band returns with their sophomore album, The '59 Sound.<br /><br />This album lives up to all the hype it garnered in the wake of their previous two recordings, and then some. For this album, the band turned down the distortion, threw some reverb on singer/guitarist Brian Fallon's vocals, and composed a love letter to their friends, the girls they loved and lost (Maria makes some return appearances, yes), family, and the music that got them through it all. The songs here manage to rock without trying to blow you away through speed or volume. For an example, check out their live show; even slower tracks like \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" set the club ablaze.<br /><br />Rating each song individually would be tedious, and frankly unnecessary; this is a front-to-back album. The whole thing flows, and is extremely enjoyable and listenable throughout. (Admittedly, though, the iTunes-exclusive 13th track provides the album is a far more appropriate closer than \\"The Backseat\\") The best way to listen to this album is on vinyl, of course, lyric sheet in hand, and letting yourself drift into the songs and stories. One of the best of 2008.

B000Y9PILI|5.0|\\"Songs For Beginners,\\" is a cult favorite of hippie-era folk-pop, one of the strongest (and most delicate) albums of Graham Nash's career.  Recorded in 1971 when ex-Hollie Graham Nash was fully ensconced in the Crosby Stills & Nash supergroup, the album has plenty of input from his CSN bandmates, but the songwriting is all Nash's and the artistic focus is much clearer. These quiet singer-songwriterish tunes are very much in the soft-pop CSN mode, but there's a unique tone that is pure Graham Nash, allowing him to emerge as his own, fully-formed man.  David Crosby, Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, Rita Coolidge, Dave Mason and David Lindley all pitch in, with Nash sculpting a melodic country-ish feel throughout. This is probably the best of Nash's solo albums, a cohesive, beautiful, heartfelt set of twee counterculture lullabies. The dewy-eyed, tender romanticism of Nash's love songs heightens the painful anguish of the political material, the anthemic \\"Chicago,\\" which served as a harsh postmortem of the chaotic demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention, and the simpler (more powerful) \\"Military Madness,\\" which gains strength from its understated tone.<br /><br />The political songs bracket the rest of the record, in which Nash delves deep into romance and love, producing some of his most achingly beautiful ballads, songs like \\"Simple Man,\\" \\"Wounded Bird\\" and the gorgeous \\"Sleep Song.\\" Several songs were written as Nash was working through the end of his long romance with Joni Mitchell, and the agony of that breakup comes through with painful clarity.  Throughout the album he attempts to reconcile the solipsistic, spaced-out self-absorption of the psychedelic drug scene with the need to connect with other human beings. \\"Love\\" was a word that was tossed around a lot in those days, but Nash placed particular emphasis on emotional growth, empathy and fidelity, rather than the swinging sexual adventurism of the times (as heard, say, in Stephen Stills' \\"Love The On You're With\\".)  In song after song Nash seems to say, \\"hey, there's a real person right there in front of you. their emotions matter; listen to them and make some sacrifices yourself to make this love thing work.\\" It's a beautiful record -- gooey, sure, but gooey in a good way and representing the best that this branch of the hippie music scene had to offer.<br /><br />For this 2008 remaster, Rhino Records has remixed the record beautifully -- some old fans may be shocked, but I like the end result, which simultaneously softens the mix and makes it cleaner and crisper.  The album never sounded better, or more intimate. A second disc is included for the DVD-A crowd (I never got the appeal of listening to music through your TV, but this disc sounds great, too.)  Also included are onscreen lyrics, photographs and other archival materials.  If you've never heard this album before, this is a great opportunity to discover a hippie folk-rock classic.

If you love westerns and you love the Old West, you have to like and enjoy this motion picture.  It deserves a new reputation.  Watch it in the DVD format for an hour or more in two or three sessions. You will be much more favorable to the production in all of its dimensions.
031606792X|1.0|I have always been an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction; I love J k Rowling's Harry Potter series, Bram Stoker's Dracula, and, of course, Stephanie Meyer's Twilight. Meyer created an intense plot of forbidden love and vampire mystique. However, throughout the quartet, the content becomes increasingly more risqué, especially considering that Meyer's main audience is pre-teen and teenage girls. I feel Breaking Dawn is the climax in a progressively inappropriate and destructively influential saga.   Meyer's heroine, eighteen year old Bella, is always pushing Edward for sex. She tries to seduce him, plays with his emotions, and attempts to bargain for physical intimacy. Middle school aged children are having their minds filled with sensual images and having their hormones aroused with sexual references. Do we want the youth of America pounded with such private things? I find it distressing that Breaking Dawn is not appropriate in its content for those who are its biggest fans.   Breaking Dawn is full of subliminal messages about women and relationships. In regard to premarital sex, Edward is the one to always resist; this portrays women as weak and wanting nothing more than sex. It is true that Meyer does not go into detail on the couple's wedding night, and that Bella and Edward do not have premarital sex. Some will say that Meyer abides by a higher moral code than much of modern literature. This is true. However, physical intimacy is a prominent theme throughout all of the Twilight books. Bella wants more. What is this teaching the teenagers of America? You need sex. A relationship is nothing without physical contact. It creates the idea that if the man does not want to make love, then his affection is not genuine. These are the subliminal messages conveyed to Meyer's young readers.   Some parents are not allowing their children to read Breaking Dawn, but Meyer has endorsed a theme of disobedience and dishonesty. Bella's father does not like Edward, and he strongly expresses his disapproval of their relationship, yet Bella sneaks Edward into her bedroom nearly every night. Now, the idea of the reckless and independent teenager has always appealed to children. But, does that make it right? No. Meyer also chose to portray Bella's mother as an airhead. Bella has said on multiple occasions that she could not even take care of herself. This only serves to further cement any negative views Meyer's readers have of their own parents. It is natural for teenagers to want independence, but disrespect and disobediance should not be idealized or praised. Meyer is undermining her own position as a mother with these ideas.   At eighteen, I can understand why this book is so popular among America's youth; it is the story of a lonely girl whose dreams come true. But if youth are exposed to certain ideas, they will begin to emulate them. We must ask ourselves, what is Meyer really selling her readers? It is not a fairy tale \\"happily ever after,\\" but sex and lies.

6301008960|4.0|\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is a charming 80s classic that never gets old. I've always had alot of affection for this film, and was pleased to locate a copy on Amazon. This was from Patrick Dempsey's pre-Grey's Anatomy, feature film stardom period. He turned out several funny, heartwarming, & charming films during this time. I personally wish he would stick to films and bid adieu to Grey's Anatomy & Dr. Derek Shepard. While I am a big fan of both GA and Dempsey, I really have no love for \\"McDreamy\\" as a character/sex symbol--WAY overrated in my POV!!!
B001CU1RRW|3.0|Looked this one up on another site and it's basically identical in track lineup to the original three-disc version, only with eco-friendly packaging. If you only got the original two-disc Essential collection, or didn't pick it up at all, this might be a great set for you. Bruce-philes that already have the first version (me) probably won't find much if anything new on the 3.0 set, unless they just like having every incarnation of everything.

Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip blow Black Ice away, and don`t even think about comparing it to earlier AC/DC albums. Good, but not great. Please, let`s stick to the classics on Tour.

0132350882|5.0|The book is a great guide to the basic qualities of good code. While many of the guidelines were familiar, reading the book helped me reconsider some rules that I had followed out of habit, but which no longer make sense. Like many good books even if you know and agree what it says, reading the book can help you explain \\"the obvious\\" to others. Clean Code has all the qualities of a classic book.<br /><br />Bob does not just a list of  rules for \\"good\\" code. He explains why following the rules makes for better code, and provides several examples of how following the rules make arguably good code (like JUnit) better. Buy this book if you write code or manage people who write code. This is a must read if you are developing a coding standard for your team. Even if you don't accept all of Bob's guidelines, reading this book  will help you think about what standards make sense for your team.
0439023483|2.0|Let me first start off by saying that this isn't a bashfest review. I was honestly taken aback by the all the praise this book received. It received a lot of publicity because Stephenie Meyer recommended it, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was a fantastic read.    It was a decent read. It was a something-to-do read. But I found it in no way as amazing as it was played up to be when I purchased it. I found this book to be written somewhat childishly, overcompensating for that fact by crazy, lame character names. Katniss? Primrose? Gale? Peeta? Glimmer? I understand that this novel is set in futuristic once-North America, but the names set my first impressions throughout the book, and I just could not get past that.     I also, at times, found Katniss's voice to be somewhat unbelievable and juvenile--I found it hard to believe she was sixteen when her voice sometimes reminded me of a twelve or eleven year old. This disappointed me because, in the beginning before the Games, she did seem much older than that.     SPOILERS:    Finally, I found the love triangle to be somewhat meaningless. Gale receives a chapter or two in the beginning, and a few periodic mentionings throughout the book, but all we really know about him is that he hates the Capitol, likes to hunt, and is the school heartthrob. I felt a little cheated that Katniss decided that she wasn't sure she could choose between Peeta and Gale, after all she and Peeta went through. Perhaps this triangle would have felt more solid to me had Gale been given more time to establish himself in the beginning.    Overall, I really do not regret that I read this book and I don't feel like it was a waste of my money. It gave me something other than school material to read, and I enjoyed escaping to the total unreality of it sometimes. But, in the end, I wasn't too impressed with it as a whole.
0375826726|3.0|It took two weeks but I finally finished Book Three of the now to be Cycle.  I started off very excited to get into this book since to me personally it felt like a real long time since Eldest.     The initial storyline with the Razac I enjoyed and felt like I was in for a fun time.  Then I personally feel the book came to a screeching halt.  I could not get into the story.  I felt that each sentence was  filled with too much description and that it was in there to make the page count higher.  Many times I found myself just reading through the words trying to find some type of action only to find some and have it end so quickly.      So with the whole middle of the book possibly more void of much action the last seventy five or so pages once again gave me hope that maybe Book Four can redeem this story as a whole.      The book in my view would of been better shorter or skip much of these long winded sentences about nothing and focus on the action and keep the readers interested in what they are investing their time with.     May Book four be an improvemnet and a spectacular finish to this storyline.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|After watching the first few episodes of \\"Mad Men\\", you can be forgiven if your eyes burn and you start to cough. It might be the only television show in history to cause second-hand smoke. Set in 1960, \\"Men Mad\\" is really about the 1950's and it captures the spiritual emptiness of the period perfectly. While the Eisenhower era has been romanticized recently as a wonderful time when all Americans had jobs, homes, and cars (and when Republicans were considered \\"nice\\" people believing in thrift) this fantasy is true only if you were a straight, white male. And a conforming one at that. Still, the emotion that pervades this series is sadness: no one is happy, no matter how many material goodies they have. Even the beatniks are gloomy and dull.<br /><br />The men survive by chain-smoking, drinking themselves insensible and attempting to seduce anything in a skirt. The women are treated to such casual and pervasive sexism that, viewing \\"Mad Men\\", even conservative women like Phylliss Schlafly will send Gloria Steinem a fruit basket. The women themselves are either the original \\"Desperate Housewives\\" or trying to stay sane by manipulating the men who prey on them. People of color exist merely as waiters and elevator operators. In the world of 1960 advertising, they are completely non-existent. You see no ads depicting a black or Hispanic family buying a new car, sharing a beer with friends or ogling a new refrigerator. Nor will you for another decade.<br /><br />Centering around the advertising executives of the fictional Sterling-Cooper agency (\\"Mad Men\\" is slang for the admen working on Madison Avenue in New York City, the archetypal Men in the Gray Flannel Suits), \\"Mad Men\\" succeeds more from mood then plot. The action is focused on the nuances of facial expression that speaks louder than words at a time when true self-expression was unknown and unwanted. The plot itself centers on rising adman star Don Draper (Jon Hamm), who has a secret past and his relationship with his suppressed wife, Betty (January Jones) who, although in therapy, is treated like a dependent child by her analyst who discusses her case only with her husband, not her. Elisabeth Moss shines as Peggy Olson, Draper's new secretary who is ahead of her time in terms of sexual liberation and professional intelligence. When she finally writes copy for a successful ad campaign (unheard of for the women in the office) she is condescendingly offered a drink, a pat on the back but no pay or no position. She chafes under her treatment and one wonders what the coming of the tumultuous Sixies has in store for her.<br /><br />Which bring us to the children of the principal characters. All those cute little tykes running around with cowboy hats and cap guns will, within the coming decade, become hippies, anti-war protesters, feminists and environmental activists. Bob Dylan is still a year away from descending upon the scene but if there ever was a time that needed a'changing, it was 1960 America. The Beatles, Vietnam, and Kennedy's assassination are just around the corner but no one at Sterling-Cooper knows this or even has the imagination to envision the cataclysmic changes about to descend upon them.

B000SMQ1WQ|5.0|Sumptuous, rich, lush and inviting. Like a gilt-edged dream, Joel Schumacher's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a triumphant love note to beauty, song and scenery.<br /><br />Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical (and Gaston Leroux's novel), this movie ends up being beautiful in every scene, with solid acting and and a tragic antihero. The singing, the sumptuous sets, the acting -- all are the ingredients of a musical tour de force.<br /><br />In 1870, a Paris opera house is under new management -- just as diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver, a glorious diva-from-hell) is almost killed by a stage curtain, and stomps out. Fortunately Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), taught by a mystery tutor, can take over the soprano's role, and soon becomes famous for her singing. Even better, it catches the attention of her childhood sweetheart, Vicomte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).<br /><br />But Raoul doesn't realize that Christine was taught by a disfigured, tortured genius who hides under the opera house. And the Phantom of the Opera is not only determined that Christine should be the star, but also be his wife. And he's willing to kill for it. Can Raoul break the Phantom's hold over Christine, or will she embrace \\"the music of the night\\"?<br /><br />Watching this, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who did \\"Phone Booth\\" and the awful \\"Batman and Robin.\\" Instead it looks as if the love child of Jean Cocteau and Peter Jackson decided to direct a musical, swathed in masks, roses, gilt angels, snow and velvet.<br /><br />And it all wraps around Webber's solid songs (\\"Turn your face away from the garish light of day/turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light/and listen to the music of the night!\\") from the stage musical. Most of the lines are sung, which surprisingly doesn't detract from their believability. And there's plenty of fun with the cameras, whether it's the dizzying views of the backstage, or a zoom through a stone floor to the Phantom's face.<br /><br />Schumacher also adds a few extra scenes, including a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom, which makes the vicomte seem more passionate; and a flashback to the Phantom's horrific childhood. What's more, the story is framed by scenes from forty years later -- sepia-toned scenes in the dusty remains of the Opera.<br /><br />The three most prominent roles are what make or break this movie, and in this case, the casting is nearly ideal. Rossum has the ingenue looks -- and the powerful pipes -- to carry off the role of Christine, torn between her love and her passion. Similarly, Patrick Wilson gives some brains and strength to Raoul, and despite the romantic appeal of the Phantom, Raoul isn't hard to cheer for.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is a bit more difficult. Most of the time his singing is solid, and his acting is powerful and tragic as the \\"loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven.\\" The scene where he tries to seduce Christine is deeply sensual. But occasionally his performance gets really hammy, such as the unmasking, where he flings himself around screaming, \\"You little prying Pandora! You little demon!\\"<br /><br />Lush, exquisite and passionate, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a solid adaptation of Webber's musical, with good acting and excellent direction.

B001DHXT2A|4.0|Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is still on the run.  He's still considered a fugitive as per General Ross (William Hurt).  When the General decides to make his own Hulk-like experiment on Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), chaos breaks out.  Then, it's up to Banner to utilize his genetic accident and transform into the Hulk and stop Blonsky.    I have to admit, my expectations were rather low given the Hulk's big screen history.  2003's \\"Hulk\\" featured the green beast romping aimlessly around the desert jumping miles at a time.  The plot seemed to have the same characteristics...it was an aimless romp with the Hulk smashing things around.  However, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is so much better than its predecessor on so many levels.    For starters, there was actually a plot to this film.  Banner was trying to rekindle his love interest in Betty (Liv Tyler), seeking to find a cure for his condition and battle Blonsky.  The most important area of improvement was the CGI.  It looked amazing and the action scenes were truly captivating, especially the end fight scene.  Furthermore, no more long distance jumping.  The Hulk actually pulled off some signature moves...Hulk Smash!    Although \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" was a vast improvement on the earlier attempt, I wouldn't say it's incredible.  It's excellent and is definitely worth adding to your collection.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|What can be said about your basic rock n roll garage bar band!  I have been an AC/DC fan for over 20 years and never get tire of them from anything they put out.  The people that complain about them saying that they put out the same CD over and over again aren't fans only music haters.  From what I'm seen so far with their tour coming up it looks to me as if they are selling out everywhere and they still have what it takes although they have never lost it compared to other bands.  Black Ice was a long, long time coming and well worth the wait and well worth the money $11.00 god!<br />For me, takes me back to the Back In Black days for some reason. I have my ticket to see them and cannot wait!
B001F2W4Y2|1.0|AC/DC = Sellouts.  Once again this band makes back in black pt.10.  YAWN!  Stormy May Day was decent that's it.  No standout songs and it took 8 years to make....all you need is Back In Black and some Bon scott stuff (if you actually like this band that is) and that's all.  AC/DC were never that great a band to begin with, just boring.
0316172324|2.0|Gladwell writes interestingly and clearly about some interesting research. But it doesn't stick together for me; seems more a compilation of essays than a cohesive book. Nor do I believe the main simplistic conclusion people tend to draw from it is justified or helpful.    More specifically, Blink doesn't at all justify the general simplification so many seem to be taking that it's ALWAYS (or even nearly always) best to go with immediate intuition/gut feel rather than more deliberate decision-making. Rather, one of the key aspects of judgement and decision-making is knowing when  to go with a quick intuitive assessment and when a systematic approach is needed. Blink doesn't help me much with that at all; rather it seems to obscure the issue in my view.     Hence I see the first chapters of 'Nudge' as a better popular introduction to decision-making. The first author of Nudge (Thaler) has the depth of experience in decision-making research that Gladwell lacks.

0563486430|3.0|The Stone Rose by Jaqueline Rayner is a brisk read, but I wouldn't rank it among the better entries of the BBC Books series. The story is told more with Rose Tyler as the protaganist and while the Doctor does spend a good deal of the book trying to set things right, it's Rose who is the real star here. The plot's mystery does pay off nicely in the end but only after a somewhat shaky plot complication. How much you enjoy The Stone Rose will depend on how well you accept that. I enjoyed it and suspended my disbelief but I still found it less than amazing. On the plus side, the Doctor gets to play gladiator in a Roman arena and the characterization of Rose Tyler is one of the better I've read. The Doctor says things that he might say on the TV series, but on the whole, it didn't sound as \\"Tennanty\\" as other authors (Justin Richards, Stephen Cole) in their respective BBC  Doctor Who novels.

B001DDBCUK|3.0|If this had been any other movie, I would have found it flat and unfulfilling.  Lots of promise, but no delivery.  What else were they going to do with the movie but have yet another fight between Carrie and Big?  And break up Samantha and Smith?  Surely they could have found some more interesting (and plausible) plot points?  Big is a captain of industry, yet in this movie, he's painted as indecisive and vacillating.  He's always been that way to some extent, but in this movie, they've exaggerated that characteristic to inject some drama into an otherwise weak plot.    The interaction between the friends felt somewhat forced at times.  Still, I was happy to see the movie do well, if for no other reason than they'll be making another movie.  And I hope it's much, much better than this one!
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet:    I'm 28 and tend to run away from anything in the genre \\"emo,\\" however, this band (especially for being so young) have irresistible hooks, awesome power riffs, and the lyrical content is surprisingly adept for a band of their age. I generally expect to hear whiny lyrics about break-ups, high school crushes, and wrist slitting with young bands in this genre, but I find the lyrics surprisingly non-chelant.     This band rocks, I'm a fan and a believer. Bar none.
B00000DI2T|5.0|I feel slightly uncomfortable rating a Mahler symphony cycle, because there is simply no \\"perfect\\" Mahler cycle. Every conductor has his/her glorious moments and not-so-glorious moments in their Mahler cycles. That being said, however, Bernstein's cycles are some of the best out there.     First of all, the sound quality of this (last set) of Bernstein Mahler cycles is wonderful, which is to be expected, since DG has a great reputation for their sound.     The issue I'd like to address the most, however, is Bernstein's \\"self-indulgence\\", which has led to some negative reviews for this set. Many will notice that Bernstein's constantly changes his tempo, even when the score does not indicate such changes. I would most certainly disagree with such practices had this been a performance of Haydn or Mozart, but Mahler? One should not forget that Mahler was one of the last great Romanticists, flourishing at the end of the 19th/beginning of the 20th century. It was common practice at that time to fluctuate tempi, exaggerate dynamics, and even re-orchestrate scores (Mahler himself re-orchestrated other composers' works). So perhaps the \\"self-indulgence\\" displayed here is a more accurate depiction of Mahler's style than \\"straight\\" interpretations, such as those from Solti. Don't forget that some of the greatest conductors in history were famous for their freedom of tempi (including Furtwangler, Mravinsky, and Mengelberg - who was Mahler's student!).    Although Bernstein's tempi are too slow at times, he has a clear grasp of Mahler, and in this set, we hear Mahler's symphonies reflected through one of the greatest musical communicators of all time. So please give this (and Bernstein's earlier Sony cycle) a chance!
B000VI70WM|2.0|This album really missed the boat. Its like listening to Justin Timberlake's album with vocals provided by Simon. I mean except for Simon and Nick, JT and Roger just took the ride with them and sat in the corner while Timberlake/Timbaland took Simon to the office and ask him to now sing on these beats. The worst thing is that JT is promoting this album like he produced it. The only thing you hear is drum machines and keyboard noises and then rapper comes in. Man I cannot believe that Sony really pushed DD to do hip/hop dance stuff and in the process could not provide a producer or visa for Andy T for the reportage album. Which makes up for Red Carpet Massacre, a disaster.
1416594884|3.0|Years ago, I was awestruck by the power of Le Carre's books, from \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" to \\"The Little Drummer Gi rl.\\" Later, I found myself caught up in the problems of \\"The Night Manager.\\" I loved the moral complexities, the character depth, and the astute dialogue.<br /><br />Since then, few of his novels have held me in quite the same way. They often seem vague, floundering, with no real direction. \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" has glimpses of that old Le Carre, though never as focused or riveting as in those earlier years. This time around, we are drawn into the mystery of a young man from Chechnya who's shown up in Germany. He bears marks of imprisonment and mental instability, and yet he seems to have valuable connections in the German banking industry. He receives pity and mercy from a banker and a female lawyer, while being hunted by shadowy figures from past and present. Along the way, Le Carre makes some biting commentary on the state of affairs in the modern Western world.<br /><br />As expected, we are given in-depth looks at character and setting here, as well as the emotional and political structures that rise and fall around our desire for democracy. It's an interesting story, if not a bit windy in places. It was more cohesive than some of his recent efforts, but still lacked that beating heart that seemed to pulse in his earlier books--even faintly. I kept waiting for that resuscitation to happen here, but it never quite did so. After a few books of his that have showed this same lifelessness, I wondered why.<br /><br />I went to Mr. Le Carre's website the other day and found this quote from him: \\"nothing that I write is authentic...Artists, in my experience, have very little centre. They fake. They are not the real thing.\\" I strongly disagree with this statement. Most of my favorite authors connect with me through fiction because they ARE authentic. They find that center and get to the heart of the human condition, without flinching. I think Mr. Le Carre's cynicism has robbed him of his empathy and replaced it with justifiable anger and fear. Yes, his books contain those emotions, but they stopped having a beating heart last decade...and now at last I know why.s robbed him of his empathy and replaced it with justifiable anger and fear.

B001DHXT1G|3.0|Although IRON MAN was highly moralistic in many respects, making it a far better film, this is simply a reworked version of the old television show and a comic book. That the film would not only tip its hat, but adopt many of the same elements, including the four-note da-da-da-da in the background of one shot, made it a disappointment.<br /><br />This movie sets the stage for future movies. First, although the guest appearance of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) presages an AVENGERS movie, it's quite obvious that we'll see \\"Mr. Blue\\" reemerge later as THE LEADER, the gamma-charged superbrain (don't tell me you missed Mr. Blue's bulging brain as the ABOMINATION exits the laboratory....), and of course Roth's ABOMINATION isn't dead, which is a loose end in my book.<br /><br />Honestly, I preferred the first HULK movie. Not only was Banner (Eric Bana) a more rounded personality, Betty (Jennifer Connelly) was much more beautiful than the horsey Liv Tyler, whose lips had more silicone pumped into them than the HULK's bicuperous biceps. The story, while dark and complicated at times, was far more substantial. To pretend it didn't exist in this reworking is an almost Marxist disavowal of the first movie. Unfortunate.<br /><br />The evil Tim Roth was the superstar of this movie as he was the only one with real acting ability, and this ultimately makes this film a forgetter. It has some beautiful camera work and mood setting scenes, but it doesn't follow through with anything substantial. It's probably worth having in one's collection for a future rainy Saturday, but if you haven't seen it, don't expect too much from it. The computer generated scenes are even more obvious \\"fakeys\\" in high definition.

I have been a fan of the greats like Tolkein, Jordan and Martin, and I must rank Sanderson up there.  When I finished the third book I was both amazed, sad, and happy that there might be more.  Sanderson is going to be one of the best fantasy writers of all time.
B0017XOF5A|4.0|This is a way beyond average SG1 episode that asks all the questions an audience might ask, but it throws them back at the audience and then proceeds to go on with a quick-paced adventure that is more cerebral than the typical machine gun, staff-weapon blasting stuff. And though the movie is theater-quality production, the hi-def transfer is definitely low tier. Dark areas are grainy and many shots are less than clear. It's also worth a pause when Daniel Jackson looks at the back cover of a book he published in the alternative timeline. Clearly no one thought anyone would do it as no care is made in the editing or writing of text.<br /><br />The movie's worth buying, but I wish the transfer had been better.

Children born in the past decade or two will probably be weened on these, while us older folks still struggle to watch the originals.<br /><br />As for the original releases, they are presented as basically a bonus extra, non-anamorphic, and not even close to a full restoration of the special editions.  These are comparable to the Laserdisc-transfer bootlegs that were available on eBay years ago.<br /><br />The real problem is Lucas doesn't care about the old versions.

0790731479|5.0|Here is a movie that is top notch in a lot of ways. It's a great family movie. Some may not agree, but I say it is. Adults will understand it more but kids will love the colorful creatures, even though several aspects of the film will fly right over their heads. Tim Burton really hit the button here on his unique style of filmaking, and really never did it better, even with the number of great films he's waxed his style all over through the years.<br /><br />The story starts with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as \\"The Recently Deceased.\\"  They have to learn how to be ghosts, and it's not easy. That is why there is a department dedicated to helping their cause, however, it is as backed up as an inner city welfare office. This is why sleazy swindlers such as the title character come around, dedicated to taking advantage of their delicate situation.<br /><br />When our ghosts discover that they have to share their small town dream home, with some living artsy-fart aristocrats, it's more then they can bare. SO, as most ghosts would do in this situation, they decide to scare the new tennants away. However, their obvious inexperience proves as a pitfall. Especially since these a*holes get a kick out of it, and start using them as party favors. Enter Michael Keaton as Beedle Geuss (He needs somebody to pronounce his name right).  The couple, desperate, go against the wishes of the department and hire him, to give the new tennants a proper scare. Although they soon realize that they may have gotten in too far over their heads with this ghoul.<br /><br />Lydia, played by Winonna Ryder, is the disillusioned daughter of the artsys and she somehow naturally communicates with the dead, and becomes a friend to the couple. Naturally she becomes the prime target for Beetlejuice also (If I was a sleazy ghoul, I would be all over her too!) and thats when things get ugly. But don't worry too much, because in the end everyone figures out how to compromise, and dance around the house to the tune of Shake Senora. The comedic icing of the whole demented cake.<br /><br />This movie works just as well as a comedy, as it does a terrific ghost story. The effects are great, and a symbol to what made Tim Burton so cool early in his career (who can forget those claymation sand serpents?) The score is perfectly creepy, and this thing is just an all around great movie. Good stuff for the Halloween film fest peeps. I pull it out all the time!ora.

B001AX9DT0|3.0|all that.  At times Ray sounds like he worships  Otis Redding much more so than Ray Charles.  At   other times he sounds like Damien Rice.  At no   time does he sound like the \\"Man in Black\\".  Their   voices, stylings, life in songs have absolutely  noithing in common.  That being said, in this day   and age, there are no Johnny Cash's nor Ray Charles'.  That doesn't mean it can't be good.  It is good. Not great.  It can get a little \\"more of the same\\" after awhile  and his voice, while unique, does not quite carry off the   blues nor dixie tunes.

I have little to add to the other glowing reviews except for again pointing out the fully-formed characterizations of every major and most minor actors.  The love stories-Mama and Papa; Papa and Liesel; Liesel and Max; and especially Liesel and Rudy displayed the greatest humanity within the most terrible of crucibles.

Great holiday themed movies,younger generations have a trouble seeking any true modern classics. The Polar Express is finally the pivotal film needed.<br /><br />The story is rather simple, but the innocence it brings fourth is amazing. Characters of all different backgrounds converge on an adventurous trip to the north pole and back. The CGI is great, really capturing the magic the movie composes. The music and atmosphere are dreamingly surreal, along with a good hearted nature.<br /><br />The feeling I've obtained every winter before Christmas arrives from viewing this is always an enlightening experience.

0143113100|5.0|This book is a must for understanding the potential benefits of the changeable brain even for a novice to the idea of \\"neuroplasticity.\\" Whether you are a patient who could benefit from this book, or whether you are simply curious to explore the term \\"neuroplasticity,\\" this book will open your eyes to a new level of many possibilities and hopes within human life.     Overview + Summary     For the people who are not familiar with the notion of \\"neuroplasticity,\\" I will first introduce the meaning of the term as it is defined in the book by the author. In the preface, he explains that \\"neuro is for `neurons,' the nerve cells in our brains and nervous systems; and that plastic is for `changeable, malleable, modifiable'\\" (xix). Thus, the idea of \\"neuroplasticity\\" refers to the brain that can change its own structure and function as opposed to the commonly accepted view of the brain comprising of many areas that are dedicated to a specific function. For example, Broca's area has an important role in understanding and producing syntactically complex sentences and other language functions. Therefore, a localizationist opposing the idea of \\"neuroplasticity\\" would argue that damage to this area would impair its role in language processing and speech production; and further, full recovery would not be possible due to an unchangeable brain.      However, the discoveries that the brain could be shaped to perform more efficiently even after the critical period; and that if certain parts of the brain failed to function properly, other parts could often take over became a breakthrough in neuroscience. The author provides much evidence to support the notion of \\"neuroplasticity,\\" which was once regarded as a radical idea that was challenged by many neuroscientists. He tells the story of his encounters with different \\"neuroplasticians,\\" the \\"practitioners of the new science of changing brains\\" and the patients they have transformed (xx).      The fascinating story of a woman who falls perpetually due to her lost vestibular system is introduced in the first chapter. To briefly give an insight of her story, it is first necessary to explain the role of the vestibular apparatus. It is the sensory organ for the balance system; and further, it has a strong connection to the visual system. Since she has lost nearly 95% to 100% of her vestibular system, she could not maintain her balance, causing her to fall continuously. Further, her case was considered as hopeless. However, an understanding that the sensory cortex is plastic made it possible for a \\"neuroplastician\\" to replace her vestibular apparatus, sending balance signals to her brain from her tongue. Her story is not the only one demonstrating many benefits of the changeable brain. The next chapter illustrates a story of a woman, who was labeled as retarded, but who managed to build herself a better brain, further giving hope to many with learning disorders. In the third chapter, the author introduces another achievement made possible by brain plasticity-- improving people's ability to think by redesigning the brain by training specific processing areas. A \\"neuroplastician\\" describes a brain as \\"a living creature with an appetite, one that can grow and change itself with proper nourishment and exercise\\" (47). Surely, the assumption that the brain cannot be altered was proven wrong as evident through many works of \\"neuroplasticians.\\"       From the first three chapters, many benefits of the changeable brain were discussed. However, the author also introduces cases in which \\"neuroplasticity\\" could work to cause our brains to be more vulnerable to outside influences. Thus, \\"neuroplasticity\\" does not always produce positive consequences. However, he explains that the problematic neuronal networks could be undermined by \\"unlearning\\" connections between neurons as opposed to \\"learning\\" (117). Further, he demonstrates the importance of the process of \\"unlearning\\" through an example of patients from their involvement in porn to understanding and reinforcing their problems by \\"unlearning\\". Other chapters give details of stroke patients who have learned to recover either partially or almost fully to be able to lead a normal life, moving and speaking freely again. There is also a story of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD, who has taken advantages of plasticity to prevent them from acting compulsively, resulting in a more healthy lifestyle.      The most fascinating story of all, however, is the patient who was born with the left hemisphere missing. Simply, it never developed. Therefore, instead of each hemisphere working together to govern each other, the right hemisphere had learned to take over the left hemisphere. In another words, the right hemisphere has to function on its own without input from the left; and also, process the key functions of the left. However, she leads a normal life without any major difficulties. Her life is a true demonstration how radically the brain can change.      Overall, the central theme of \\"neuroplasticity\\" was well presented and developed through the story of the author's encounters with \\"neuroplasticians\\" and their patients. The changeable brain, a notion once challenged by localizationists, is the current truth appreciated by many whose lives were touched and transformed. However, the author also points out that the plastic change in the brain also may have negative effects. Therefore, understanding both positive and negative consequences is necessary to fully explore the possibilities of \\"neuroplasticity.\\"     Style and Structure     The preface first introduces the idea of \\"neuroplasticity\\" to provide readers with some expectations about the content of the book. His central idea of \\"neuroplasticity\\" is very well explained through his encounters with many \\"neuroplasticians\\" and their patients whose lives they have transformed. Even for potential readers who are not familiar with the term \\"neuroplasticity,\\" thisbook could be easily understood as the author thoroughly explains all the technical terms of neuroscience related words he introduces. Further, the author categorizes different cases in eleven different chapters. If readers seek to view a specific case that interests them personally, it is always easy to take a look at contents in the beginning of the book and decide which section to read. Also, the notes and references section at the end of the book include comments on interesting details and articles mentioned in each chapter. Finally, the index at the end lists all the terms used in the book, allowing readers to easily go back to the parts they would like to review.     Interesting Quotes      \\"'Hardwiring' was another machine metaphor coming from the idea of the brain as computer hardware, with permanently connected circuits, each designed to perform a specific, unchangeable function.\\" (xviii)   \\"This `unmasking' is generally thought to be one of the main ways the plastic brain reorganizes itself.\\" (9)   \\"Neurons that fire together wire together.\\" (63)   \\"Neurons that fire apart wire apart--or Neurons out of sync fail to link.\\" (64)   \\"Unlearning and weakening connections between neurons is just as plastic a process, and just as important, as learning and strengthening.\\" (117)   \\"...imagining an act and doing it are not as different as they sound.\\" (203)  Four kinds of plasticity include: \\"map expansion, sensory assignment, compensatory masquerade, and mirror region takeover.\\" (276) *for more information on each type of plasticity, please, refer to p276.     For Potential Readers      This book is a treasure that one must possess. Readers with different intended purpose of exploring this book will be led to one place--the fascinating world of \\"neuroplasticity.\\" Because this book is very well organized in both style and structure as described earlier, readers will be at ease throughout the book, appreciating the author's effort to make it more approachable to anyone who may want to learn about the unchangeable brain.      There is no specific way as to direct readers how to read this book. The descriptive content in the beginning as well as the index at the end allow readers to directly go to the specific topics that are of personal interest to them. However, reading the book chapter by chapter is highly recommended.

B001F2W4Y2|4.0|After eight years in hibernation, AC/DC returns. Oddly enough, the album doesn't sound like they waited eight years at all. More like twenty. \\"Black Ice\\" is out to party like it's 1979.<br /><br />From the opening retro-riff of \\"Rock and Roll Train\\" to the closing explosion of the title track, this is meat and potatoes rock as only Ac/Dc can deliver. But as you might surmise, it doesn't measure up to their classics [[ASIN:B00008BXJG Highway to Hell]] or [[ASIN:B000002JS6 Back in Black]]. It's more in line with [[ASIN:B00008WT5G For Those About to Rock We Salute You]] or later efforts like [[ASIN:B000BC8T7I Ballbreaker]]. It will get your juices flowing at the same time it will give you the warm feeling of deva vu. You've heard this all before, and still like it.<br /><br />There are a few songs on here that will definitely rock your world. \\"War Machine\\" is reminiscent of \\"Giving The Dog A Bone,\\" and really kicks butt. \\"Stormy May Day\\" has a surprising slide guitar lead from the ever-powerful Angus Young. The only other surprise here is \\"Money Made,\\" a solid bluesy ballad. The rest is the Ac/Dc formula that they've been working since Brian Johnson (who is in fine form) took the microphone in 1980. Mammoth power chords from Angus and Malcolm, rock steady tight rhythms from Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams, with banshee wails from Johnson atop it all. That I first that the song \\"Decibel\\" was about Jezebel (with Johnson barking \\"That's the history of rock and roll!\\") is interesting to me, in Ac/Dc's world, they're kind of the same thing. Something to turn up and turn out.<br /><br />\\"Black Ice\\" is that kind of record. It is not quite the comeback Metallica's [[ASIN:1603780904 Death Magnetic]] is if only for the reason that Ac/Dc didn't really have anything to comeback from. But like a giant predatory guitar roaming the planet, \\"Black Ice\\" shows that Ac/Dc has the means to strike hard and at will, and do so at their own pace. This is a solid album, and will be rocking stadiums through the world tour to come.r to come.
B0018AK9RA|3.0|I will have to admit i did not know what to think when i first heard it i was a little disappointed....... However after a few more listens i can really appreciate it . It certainly grows on you and its One  fantastic record . Not my favourite, Painkiller is still the ultimate. There are only a handful of metal acts that could release a recording like this and for it too sound respectable. I feel Judas Priest took a gamble releasing Nostradamus As its so different to the usual stuff however it has paid off and will give them more scope in the future....... Its something that they had to do. I will really look forward to their next release
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I honestly do not understand why so many people have given this excellent movie such mediocre reviews. I can only imagine that in this dumbed-down age of limited attention spans, anything that challenges the intellect is regarded as 'uncool'. Some reviewers say that the characters are under-developed, while others say that De Niro has taken on too much. This is utter nonsense. The movie is superb, the casting is superb, the acting is superb, and the story is superb. It is, in other words, a masterpiece.

1416575464|3.0|I am a major Domino fan. I have been reading it for two years, living vicariously through its profiles of well-heeled decorators and clients, and the resulting photo shoots. I never used to read decorating magazines because I found them a little stuffy or hilarious, but Domino strikes the right balance between whimsy and realistic. So the book - 4 stars. Why not 5 stars for a 10 star magazine?     The book is, well, a rehash of Domino photos for the past few years. The book is a roundup of decorating elements that have appeared in the magazine - patterns, objects, furniture, objets d'art - and they are presented in a format similar to the Lucky Magazine book on fashion. (Both magazines are published by same company.) The book is high on pictures but low on practical advice. You see pictures, a summary of key elements (as in shapes of furniture, a few keywords about the style). There is some information on how to go about the process of DIY decorating or the professional route, but I really missed the details on where to buy what you saw in a picture, or the personal commentary from people who participated in the decorating that makes the actual magazine so great. I think a major element of Domino's success was to hear how living in a room felt like, and these rooms were beloved because they were very habitable, not at all untouchable or filled with dangerous-looking items (Kelly Wearstler, I'm looking at you). But here you just get the end result, without the process, which is what decorating and creativity are all about.      I would recommend this to people who have NOT ever read Domino, or who don't have the patience for it and would prefer to just look at pictures for ideas on how to fix a room, or to get a sense of what they do like. Faithful Domino subscribers (and the book does include a subscription) might prefer to stick with the back issues. I wish I hadn't been forced to throw mine away due to a move to a smaller place, so this book is a nice resource, but it does not measure up to the real thing.    Some pluses, however, since I would like to end on a positive note for a magazine I've really adored:   - great section on small spaces and how to deal, particularly for renters  - how to put together a not-embarrassing kid's room (!)  - love the hand-drawn illustrations (not found in the real magazine)    Ideally, I'd give it a 3.5/5.
B0013GUKDC|5.0|Dairy of a Wimpy Kid  By Jeff Kinney    Online game developer/designer and now author Jeff Kinney introduces his audience to Greg Heffley, a rather puny, mildly popular, intellectual (but not interested in embracing that quality) middle schooler whose journal reflections will keep the reader chuckling.      As with most middle school kids, Greg finds this time in his life wrought with lofty ideals, deflating disappointments, and intimidating challenges.  His mother buys him a journal in which he chronicles his thoughts about his life and activities in and out of school.  At school, his familiar and funny misdaventures include avoiding the cursed touch of the infamous aged, begrimed, and sun-fried cheese; attempting to boost his self-image by running a smear campaign to win a student council; and wrestling in a form-fitting leotard in P.E.  At home, he is sandwiched between his older brother Rodrick (who enjoys many more freedoms than Greg) and his annoying, over-indulged younger brother Manny (who gets EVERYTHING he asks for at Christmas).    The first of four books in a series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid:  A Novel in Cartoons became a #1 New York Times Bestseller.  The reader need but read the first page to get a taste of the humor and enjoyment of Kinney's witty combination of text and cartoons:  \\"First of all, let me get something straight:  This is a JOURNAL, not a diary...All I need is for some jerk to catch me carrying this book around and get the wrong idea.  The other thing I want to clear up right away is that this was MOM's idea, not mine.\\"  Greg Heffley is a twenty-first century Charlie Brown--he just can't seem to catch a break.  Readers from middle school through high school as well as adults will enjoy the good-intentioned, hilarious, and unfortunate antics of Greg Heffley.
0307455874|4.0|I picked up this book because I planned to vote for Obama for the upcoming presidential race but felt I should really educate myself on what he believed in.  This book did just that.      Obama writes just as he speaks - the book contains moving and passionate discussions surrounding society, government and what he wants to change as a public servant.  It gives enough insight into how he views America to understand how he'd act as president but not too much detail to bore you.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|There is not some reworking of the comic book character, so the movie is focused on action scenes which truly capture this unique super hero in fist-throwing romps. Actor and co-screenwriter Edward Norton portrays Bruce Banner in a way to push things to the computer-generated - and highly cartoonish - Incredible Hulk, who clearly is the star.<br /><br />Without a complicated backstory and rapid pace - though it may have too much of a video game feel for some - the battles of the Incredible Hulk are...well, incredible; especially when the military futilely throws all types of gadgetry at the large one. This emerging franchise has mapped out a solid plan to become a successful second-tier hit in the future summers of super heroes on the large screen.
0060920084|5.0|I'd read four Bryson books before I read this one, and this is the funniest of the lot. Irreverence and biting wit on almost every page. I've definitely had more laughs from this book than any other I've ever read.    I can only assume that the people who are giving this riveting work a meager one star are the kind of people who are more than happy to laugh at Bryson poking fun at anyone else, but when his inimitable humor is directed at them it ceases to be funny. Kinda reinforces some Bryson's observations in this excellent work.    Thoroughly recommended.

B000Q66PXE|5.0|This captivating, compelling, culturally accurate rendition of ancient Rome is a well-written, acted, directed, staged, and screened story of two soldiers.  Their story intertwines with Julius Caesar, Brutus, Anthony, and Cleopatra.  Rome captures the world of Rome in detail, from the music, to the graffitti on the walls, the town crier, the orgies, the parades, the gladiator pit, the calender, life at the family dinner table, the slaves,  the religious rites, the street gangs, homosexuals, the Jews, Egyptians, the barbarian tribes, the military camps, the theatre, the brothels, the opium dens, and the senate.  Rome's focus on the women of the age elevate it beyond all of the other films about Rome, even \\"Spartacus\\" and  Marlon Brando's great version of \\"Julius Caesar\\", and breaks new ground.  Like many, my only complaint is that the story ends, when in reality, the Roman Empire lasted 10,000 years, and there is much more of the story to be told.  My sincere thank you goes to John Milius and his magnificent crew of writers and actors that pulled off this masterpiece.

I can't resist quoting Fred L.

And ever since her mother married Zoey's now 'step-loser', she doesn't feel like her mother cares a great deal for her anymore. And just when she thought life couldn't get any worse, a Vampyre arrives at school and `marks' her with the crescent moon, the sign of a 'soon-to-be' vampyre.<br /><br />Upon arriving home, Zoey is in desperate need to talk to her mother, hoping that she could talk about it with her mother, looking for the caring mother she remembered. However, her mother proves differently and with her step-father there, she's sent and locked in her room. A deeply religious man, her step-father believes that it was Zoey's wicked ways that put her in her position and the only thing that reverse it would be prayers and a talk with a psychologist. But that wasn't the answer Zoey was seeking, and slips out of the house to see her grandmother, the only person in her life that has shown her unconditional love. But Zoey becomes even more sick, falls and blacks-out, only to awaken to find herself at the House of Night: a school where the Marked go to learn how to become a vampyre, to learn to harness their new powers.<br /><br />And just when Zoey thinks that maybe she'll be able to feel like she finally fits in, Fate would change that. For Zoey has been blessed by the Goddess Nyx herself, and the shape of the crescent moon on her forehead is no longer an outline. It's completely filled in. Once again, her hopes are dashed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, even at the House of Night, it seems almost like a regular high school, for the kids still act the same. And the more Aphrodite, the leader of the Dark Daughters, antagonises her, the more she notices something not right about the group and becomes determined to bring Aphrodite down, with the help of her new found friends, believing her no more than a regular snobby bully.<br /><br />For a young adult novel (and I'm 31), I thought this was pretty good.

1401207138|5.0|This is a superb story that is incredibly well told and for the most part surprisingly realistic. The writing is excellent with a great deal of variety of cross reference to give a more detailed, fleshed out tale.<br /><br />This is very gripping and entertaining with a lot of well drawn characters. There's a lot of deep reaching into the minds of the costumed heroes and it is very realistically put together.<br /><br />I found this an incredibly good read and it couldn't come more highly recommended.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]

0930289234|4.0|Better late than never on Watchmen; since this is going to be a blockbuster next summer (saw the previews on The Dark Knight), thought I'd better get around to reading this one, which was the first graphic novel I've ever read.<br /><br />Time included Watchmen on their list of 100 best novels.  While I thought that Watchmen was definitely a great, fun read, I don't know that's it's quite on the level with some of the other novels on their list.  That's not to say Watchmen isn't good work:  it's a compelling character study of a handful of heroes.  The fundamental theme explored through the book is the question behind all superhero/vigilante stories:  do the ends justify the means?  Watchmen delves into the personality types that answer this question in the affirmitive.<br /><br />That being said, I thought Watchmen had a weak ending, despite the outstanding buildup.  The tone of the ending seemed far too ambivalent, especially after so much emotional investment in the plot, which borders on, but doesn't actually become preachy.<br /><br />I'm curious to see what kind of a movie this will make, since the emphasis isn't on action, but on the inner lives of the characters.  The trailer looked great; I just hope the writing lives up the visuals.
B00005MP58|4.0|If you are going to purchase a copy of Pride & Prejudice, there is no doubt that this is the version to buy.  It is spectacular in its scope and depiction of Regency England.  The sheer length of the production allows it to do more justice to Jane Austen's book than any mere 2hour movie could do.  With that said, it has one very serious drawback - there is not enough about Darcy and Elizabeth.  Instead, the movie is awkwardly tilted to focus on Mr. Collins.  The movie leaves out many thoughts and interactions of Darcy and Elizabeth relating to each other and yet these are the main characters of the movie and the main characters of one of the most amazing love stories ever written.  Consequently, it helps to have read the book at least once if not more times so that you can fill in the missing encounters, thoughts and dialogue.  Nonetheless, after repeated viewings, I simply fast-forwarded through most of Mr. Collins' scenes which really highlighted how much of the movie disproportionately focused on him.  But because of the resources that went into the film, the quality of the actors, and the attention to the detail of the period, this production still remains the best.  The \\"extra\\" material is useless (as it is in the anniversary version so buy this cheaper one).
B001C08RHA|3.0|Has anyone realized that the DVD version has many missing parts to it?  In the theatre, just in the beginning alone for example, where is the part where the blonde interviews Starke before they end up in bed together?  What about the Casino part where he completely doesn't show for his award?  What about all the witty commentary btwn Starke and the army squad driver/passengers??  I understand that there are deleted/extended scenes included on the DVD, BUT, I thought those were scenes that were extras that were never part of the original movie.  Am I wrong in this??????  ALSO, even some of the deleted scenes were cut!  So some of the movie that I saw in the theatre just plain doesn't even EXIST on the DVD!  Is it a different story on the double disk edition or blue ray version??  They all claim to be a 125 minute play time so what the heck??  Someone enlighten me b/c I LOVED this movie in the theatre and I am very disappointed that I don't get the full version on my DVD!

0439023483|4.0|Being an avid Stephen King fan, I usually pay close attention to his suggestions in reading material.  This book caught my attention because he had read it and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are a fan of The Long Walk as I am, you will enjoy this as a good read.  It is somewhat like it in premise, but has it's own originality.  The only thing I really would like to have known is that it is only the first book in most likely a trilogy. Had I known that, I most likely would have waited until they were all published and read them all together.  Otherwise, it was a good read and I appreciated the character development and the storyline was really good.  I highly anticipate \\"Book Two\\" from Ms. Collins.

B001DMJ9R4|5.0|i have given this release a 5 star rating based on the amazing production of the live dvd. clearly the band has been heavily auto-tuned in editing (which i think alot of reviews here dont realise) never the less id much prefer watching this than a live dvd that has horrible mixing showing all the performers flaws.    i cannot spot the  difference between \\"Almost easy\\", \\"Afterlife\\" on the bonus disc and those on the ST album. so im not sure what happened there. i have not yet listened to  the rest of the Bsides disc.
B001IUG3CU|3.0|I like AC/DC. I'm not ate-up with AC/DC though, and actually, that's almost unbelievable. You'd think someone who gets as carried away with Kiss as I do would naturally do likewise with AC/DC. I contend there's a verrrrrrrrrrrrrry fine line that separates the two bands. But somehow, I've never been as big on AC/DC as you might think. I own the CDs 'High Voltage', 'Highway to Hell', 'Back in Black', and 'The Razor's Edge'. That's the extent of my AC/DC collection, and many would say that's at least one CD too many (\\"Money Talks\\" and \\"Thunderstruck\\" are, in my opinion, the only great tracks on 'The Razor's Edge' CD). And this is a good spot to point out, I don't care what any of the self-anointed \\"real\\" AC/DC fans say, 'Black in Black' is an absolute freakin' masterpiece of rock n roll. I've got every song from that album on my iPod and I couldn't begin to take one off. I'll give 'Voltage' and 'Highway' their proper credit. They're both really good albums, and Bon Scott's street-tough attitude oozes out on every track in a way that Brian Johnson can only try to mimic. But for me, and a lot of other people, if I could only own one AC/DC album, 'Back in Black' would be my choice, hands down, no contest.<br /><br />So back to 'Black Ice'....................... I don't know what to tell you folks. It is what is. It's an AC/DC album in which, just like every AC/DC album since 'Back in Black', they're trying to capture the same magic they did on 'Back in Black' and, just like with all those other albums, they come up short. No shame in it. 'Back in Black' is an amazing album. Why wouldn't they try to copy that album's success? They'd be dumb NOT to try and copy that album. I've listened to the album 5 times now in its entirety, and there are three stand-out tracks, \\"Rock & Roll Train\\", \\"Skies on Fire\\", and \\"War Machine\\". There's 15 songs on the album, so having only 3 songs that stand out isn't necessarily a good thing, but then again, I'm not saying the other 12 songs are BAD. I'm just saying, chances are, you already OWN the other 12 songs under different song titles, on different albums. My point is, with the exception of these 3 songs I named, everything else on the album is a copy of past AC/DC hits.<br /><br />Then again, AC/DC is a band in a unique position. In my opinion, there's no need for you to go out and buy 'Black Ice', but if you DID buy it, you'd probably still proclaim the album as being \\"okay\\". You'd say that because IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE AC/DC HAS DONE FOR THE LAST 28 YEARS. Do you see where I'm going with this? To me, what makes the album \\"non-essential\\" (predictability) is also what makes it ACCEPTABLE. If your Aunt Imogene gets you this CD for your birthday, you'll listen to it and still be okay with it, even though there's nothing new on the album. It is what it is, and what it is has been the same thing for 28 years. Trying to copy a classic like 'Back in Black' is still an admirable pursuit, even if it continues to fail.<br /><br />And think about this: What would happen if 'Black Ice' came out and sounded different than what it sounds like? What if AC/DC decided to go in a new direction, and just gave up trying to copy that same sound as 'Back in Black'? What if 'Black Ice' sounded like the new Disturbed album? Or the new Metallica album? Or the new Kings of Leon album? I'll tell you what would happen: CHAOS!!!!!!!!!!!!! There would be riots in the streets! Pandemonium would rule the day! There would be plundering in Sydney and pillaging in Melbourne! Martial law would be enacted! The whole freakin' planet may shift off its axis! Okay, maybe it wouldn't be THAT bad, but AC/DC has an incredibly loyal following, and the sound that's on 'Black Ice' is EXACTLY what they expect and what they WANT to hear AC/DC do. And really, isn't that what even the casual fan like me has come to expect from them?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Here's how you rate 'Black Ice' on a scale from 1-10. Think about how you wouldrate 'Back in Black', then take that number and divide it in half. That's how I'd rate 'Black Ice'. And the planet remains firmly on its axis.ake that number and divide it in half. That's how I'd rate 'Black Ice'. And the planet remains firmly on its axis.
B00164EABO|5.0|Best movie ever, the only movies that come close are Lord of the Rings and Narnia... anyways, I want to start by saying the description is wrong, the movie starts in the city of Edge near midgar... Midgar is toxic and no one lives there any more (not since Meteorfall) except Cloud, who is hiding from his former friends and allies (and some enemies who have changed to the good side), because he is sick with Geostigma.  Working as a delivery boy, former enemy Rufus Shinra and two turks Reno and Rude try to hire him as 'muscle'.  Remnants of his old enemy Sephiroth are attempting to bring him back, and Rufus is trying to prevent that from happening by keeping the still-living head of Sephiroth's alien 'mother', Jenova, from the remnants.  Although shinra and Cloud's gang enter an uneasy alliance, they find themselves fighting side by side as the remnants attempt to receive cells from their 'mother,'  therefore becoming sephiroth.  The story is lax compared to the game, but the last half of the movie is not-stop action and the first half does have some plot points mixed in with action.  i look forward to the blu ray version.

B001AEF6IQ|5.0|The first time I learned about Torchwood was on HDNet. I saw a preview. What caught my attention was not the story but the incredible image quality. I thought to myself... I got to watch this, it looks to good on my HDTV. The whole show is shot in True HD... unlike many American tv series that are broadcasted in HD but are not shot in HD. That's why I highly recommend the Bluray version of the serie. After viewing the first episode I got hooked on it. I saw season 1 and 2 and I am waiting for season 3 to come out. If you like time travel, ghosts, ESP, people possessed, monsters, warps and black holes this is the show for you. Special effects are mostly good with some few exceptions that can be easily overlooked by all the good story line and twists the show has to offer.

B0018M6J90|5.0|this movie is funny and sweet and endearing and stylish - a very good time, I bought it immediately after recieving it on Netflix
B00192KCQ0|5.0|As a bit of background, I would say that I, like many other reviewers, consider the pinnacle of Metallica's albums to be \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and \\"...And Justice for All.\\" I like \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and The Black Album. After that, they lost me somewhat with \\"Load\\" and \\"Re-Load,\\" then completely with \\"St Anger,\\" which was absolutely atrocious.    Like many old school Metallica fans, I had pretty much thrown in the towel with \\"St. Anger\\" and given up on the idea that they would ever make a great CD again. In the 5 and a half years since that CD was released, I listened to it twice, attended one \\"Summer Sanitarium\\" show, and then essentially forgot about them, other than to keep them in the far, back reaches of my mind. When I heard information around 6 months ago that a new album was on the way, I held no expectations. As the buzz began building, I was realistically hopeful. And thankfully, I was not disappointed at all. In just a month and a half, I have listened to this album dozens of times, easily. The most of any Metallica album since \\"Justice\\" came out.     With that said, I am now happy that \\"St. Anger\\" happened. Why? Because it is my belief that if they had not sunken so low, they would've never been motivated enough to come back and make another great album, which \\"Death Magnetic,\\" in fact, is. Instead, we would've probably gotten \\"Load\\" over and over again. Perhaps we could call \\"St. Anger,\\" a noble, but very misguided, attempt to \\"recapture the fire.\\" Having literally fallen on their faces in that attempt, a new fire was ignited, and this new album is the result.     What was wrong with \\"St. Anger?\\"      - Very poor songwriting, generally devoid of memorable riffs or themes that would make you want to comeback and re-listen again and again.      - No guitar solos at all, although the songs were often, long, lumbering repetitive and very boring.      - The vocals were horrible, and frequently offkey.      - The sound of the drums, especially the snare (which sounded like Lars was pounding on a trash can lid), was very poor.     - Retarded lyrics (e.g. Frantic-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick... Arg! Shut up! Yeeeeeesh!).     - Bob Rock played bass on it.    Have these concerns been addressed on \\"Death Magnetic?\\"     - As with all of the classic \\"pinnacle of Metallica\\" albums mentioned earlier, \\"Death Magnetic\\" shares many similar traits: A quiet, slow, somber album intro that erupts into heaviness and then abruptly attacks with a sudden tempo increase. Four tracks into the album, a slow, beautiful ballad, that ends with a sonic assault. A Mega-fast thrash song as the last song, and which was immediately preceded by an amazing instrumental. In common, especially with \\"Justice,\\" this album contains very intricate arrangements, and complex, but extremely memorable musical motifs throughout. In short, the songwriting is top notch on this go round. And despite almost everything on here being long, nothing is boring, and certainly not lumbering.      - Kirk Hammett makes his continued existence in this band very much known on \\"Death Magnetic,\\" with his numerous guitar solos which, like on all the classic albums, are deft and beautiful, with an accurate, yet still emotional execution. Kirk may have stepped aside for awhile, to allow the band to step in some different directions (ones I didn't agree with), but he certainly didn't lose his skills or his touch.     - The band adopted a much lower set of tunings for \\"St. Anger,\\" but have returned to their old set and style of tunings for \\"Death Magnetic.\\" Consequently, James vocals generally sound much more \\"correct.\\" At times, he slides a little off for my personal taste, more than on some of those classic albums, but far, far less than on \\"St. Anger.\\" At times he sounds great and, in a few instances, he sounds not so good. Overall, a big improvement. His best overall vocal performance, probably not surprisingly, is on \\"The Unforgiven III,\\" which despite them re-hashing the musical themes from \\"The Unforgiven,\\" yet again, the song itself is probably as good, if not better, than the original. \\"The Day that never comes\\" ranks high for overall vocal performance as well.      - The production on the drums, and ESPECIALLY the snare was CLEARLY very carefully monitored during the recording of this album. At no time that I have listened to this, have I noticed any problem with the fullness or robustness of the snare drum sounds. It might be the best snare sound that Lars has ever achieved. It shouldn't even be necessary to comment on this, but given the \\"St. Anger\\" issues, it is worth note.      - The lyrics have their shining moments but probably are not quite as poignant as from the \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and \\"...And Justice for All\\" era. The most obvious evidence is in subtle things, like what a silly title \\"All Nightmare Long\\" is - which is especially unfortunate, since it's my personal favorite song from the album.      - Robert Trujillo played bass on it. That should be enough said, but I'll elaborate. Jason Newsted is a great bass player. No Cliff Burton, but he's a great bass player on his own merit. Robert is a bit better than Jason, all respect still given to Jason (whom I wish to soon recover from his unfortunate accident - I mean the amp falling on him, not his decision to do \\"Rock Star SuperNova\\"). And Robert is a whole heckuva lot better than Bob Rock, for crying out loud (Yes, that's called \\"stating the obvious\\"). Maybe Robert is not Cliff, but he's Robert, and that's different. Not better, not worse. Just a little different, and awesome regardless. His contributions to this album are impeccable. Metallica with a great bass player is a great Metallica. History proves this is very true and very important. (SIDENOTE: Cliff's writing contributions were greatest on \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" and then \\"Master of Puppets.\\" Think about it).     Now, having gone and compared some overall characteristics, for the purpose of addressing the concerns of like-minded individuals, let me add some random information on positive things that stand out, and haven't already been mentioned. First, I like every song on this album and the whole thing is very listenable over and over, front to back. If you like fast, thrashing, speeding, uptempo metal, like I do, you will most appreciate Track 5 (All Nightmare Long), Track 1 (That was Just your Life), and Track 10 (My Apocalypse). I like the fact that the entire band are co-writers of the entire album. Logic would tell an outsider, like myself, that this has played a part in re-igniting a fire within this band. And I have read that Rick Rubin was bluntly honest with the band about what he did and did not like. If you've seen any of the many bootlegged clips on YouTube of \\"The New Song,\\" and \\"The Other New Song,\\" you will realize that certain ideas were yanked from these and used within songs that made it onto \\"Death Magnetic.\\" This is a very telling bit of information because, if you are very critical of recent Metallica efforts like I am, you probably were not especially impressed by either of those tracks. This was before Rick Rubin got involved, I believe. It is very obvious, given that information, his contribution to the final product. In this respect, I believe he more than did his job.     As a final note, I feel it is necessary to comment on the audio. I believe the \\"loudness war\\" is utterly ridiculous, and album quality has suffered massively as a result. \\"Death Magnetic\\" is no exception. I haven't heard the Guitar Hero III version yet, but I don't need to. I've been recording my own music for 20-25 years and I've developed a decent ear. I knew within 1-2 minutes that this CD had been compressed past the point of distortion in many places. This is very stupid because if a listener needs it to be louder, turn up the volume, adjust the EQ, or buy a better sound system. Producers shouldn't try to fake the effect of a better soundvia this artificial method. It sacrifices the sound for people with high end systems in favor of giving an illusion of improvement on very cheap, inferior systems. I could rage much more deeply into this subject, but that's not the purpose here. Just be forewarned that there is very noticeable clipping in quite a few places. It is most noticeable on \\"My Apocalypse,\\" and \\"That was just your life.\\" This album, as most other recent (last 15 years, if you want to call that recent) albums, should have been released uncompressed. If this is desirable for the mp3 crowd then compress those versions before converting them. By way of comparison, if you happen to also like Rush and bought their \\"Vapor Trails\\" CD, this CD is not as overcompressed as that one, and is definitely more listenable - and of course, I'm speaking purely with respect to audio quality.    In short, this is easily a five star out of five star CD, and I applaud the band on \\"The Greatest Comeback of the Year.\\" If you are a fan of \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and \\"...And Justice for All,\\" you will enjoy this CD.
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|Death Magnetic was worth the wait, but this was not.  Maybe it will grow on me after more listens, but it just seems like all songs have riffs taken verbatim (not just similar) from older songs.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|I would like to remind listeners (especially old Keane fans) that great works of art take time to appreciate. Keane is trying to say something here, something different. Yes, it's easy to worry when you hear the first two tracks. They are different from old Keane. But the album blooms into a lush, fully orchestrated gem that makes all the more sense as you listen to Love is in the End, and let it take you back into Spiralling Down. The addition of guitar on certain tracks was surprising but beautiful. Please remember that Under the Iron Sea was quite different from Hopes and Fears. I think we all were a little shocked by the opening of Atlantic, but once we let it digest for a while, we found that it was the same Keane we knew and loved. Perfect Symmetry is no different. And, it is completely different. Thank goodness Keane didn't just repackage old material. I sincerely hope you can eventually see this for the work of art it is.

I am also a KISS  fan, and the comparison with ACDC is interesting.And whilst I was and am a KISS fan first, at least the 70s version of KISS, KISS promises to put the Fans first, but does not, and ACDC consistently puts the fans first, and has done ever since the days in Melbourne.

B001C4AFP8|3.0|What's disappointing about Ridely Scott's \\"Body of Lies\\" is that I felt nothing for it. It tells a story that should be engaging, but somehow, I wasn't engaged--I felt detached and apathetic, as if I had been watching an instructional video instead of a spy thriller. This is in no way a statement against Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio, or Russell Crowe, who have been, are now, and most likely always will be very talented people; I suspect the problems with this movie have more to do with the story, which has all the elements but just can't seem to go beyond what we've come to expect. Based on the novel by \\"Washington Post\\" columnist David Ignatius, \\"Body of Lies\\" is derivative and lethargic, taking far too long to make a point that's already been made numerous times. I kept waiting for something to pique my interest, something that would compel me to invest in both the story and the characters. Sadly, I was left dangling.    It also wasn't fun to see DiCaprio's character--a CIA operative named Roger Ferris--endure so much physical abuse. Attack dogs bite his legs, requiring a painful series of rabies injections. His transport vehicle is destroyed by a missile, which not only scars his face, but also leaves bone shards embedded in his arm. He even becomes familiar with the working end of a hammer during an uncomfortable torture scene, and I won't describe that any further. By the end of the film, Ferris looks more like a botched medical experiment than an operative for the United States. His mission seemed straightforward enough: Enter Iraq and track down a terrorist named Al Salim. Of course, missions like this are never straightforward. Too much is at stake for that to be possible, especially since unknown terrorists are responsible for bombings in Manchester, England and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Capturing Al Salim would hopefully strike a serious blow to Middle Eastern extremists.    After recovering from an attack, Ferris travels to the country of Jordan to share intelligence with Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), the head of the General Intelligence Department (GID). Hani makes it clear that he will help Ferris on the condition that no lies are told. Does that seem a little obvious to you? Why would someone in his position have to demand the truth? Isn't the truth something we all want from the people we interact with?    As all this is being established, we discover that Ferris' supervisor, Ed Hoffman (Crowe), is constantly keeping track of him with the help of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. What a strange character; he always has an earpiece on, and he interacts with his family while simultaneously communicating with Ferris. His soft voice masks a stubborn, manipulative personality, which I guess stems from his intolerance of terrorism. Unlike Ferris, he feels that negotiating will solve absolutely nothing, and he gets his point across by continuously going behind Ferris' back. Example: After ordering Ferris to inspect a Jordanian safehouse run by Al Salim, Hoffman orders a Middle Eastern operative to meet a terrorist residing there. Ferris was never told about this, which only makes things worse when the operative blows his cover. I'm really not sure how we're supposed to feel about Hoffman; it's good he knows that terrorists are rejecting technology and are therefore becoming harder to track down, but it's also unnerving that he would willingly subject Ferris to such people. A better performance from Crowe would have helped. His delivery is so lax, it was surprising DiCaprio didn't fall asleep listening to him.    While in Jordan, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), who he gradually falls in love with. While there was nothing particularly wrong with the subplot in and of itself, I'm hard pressed to say that it was necessary for the film as a whole. It felt tacked on, superfluous, and unimportant, although I'm sure the intention was for something more significant. Maybe this isn't the kind of story that needs a romance, least of all an interracial romance. Obviously, I can't say that removing it altogether would affect the story one way or another. However, I have the feeling that more significant ideas were better suited for \\"Body of Lies,\\" ideas that would have allowed it to be more meaningful.    Unfortunately, all we're left with is routine material. You experience neither highs nor lows watching this movie--there's nothing but a quiet sense of indifference. I wasn't excited or moved by any of it, not even when Ferris and Hoffman stage a terror attack in an attempt to lure Al Salim out of hiding. The film crawls its way from point A to point B, and by the time its message is delivered, we're too bored to take any interest. It doesn't help that the message has been given before, even in the most recent films about Middle Eastern terrorism. \\"Body of Lies\\" is one of Ridley Scott's weakest films, failing to engage the audience as a suspenseful spy thriller. This isn't to say that its heart wasn't in the right place. I could tell that an effort was being made, and I was pleased to see that Leonardo DiCaprio turned out yet another fine performance. It's too bad that even he couldn't make me care about what was going on; you'd think that a believable character would be able to stir up something rather than instilling a complete lack of concern. This also applies to Ridley Scott, one of today's most talented directors.
015206396X|5.0|Finally, a love story with a strong woman and a man who loves and respects that about her. I loved this story.  There are few books that can get my head out of the Twilight universe, and this one did for a few days.  I would not recommend this book to teens under the age of 16 or so, & I don't believe it should be a YA book. I'm a Twilight Mom, not a teenager.
0679805273|5.0|This book is great for ALL ages!  I originally read this book when it was given to my dad by a friend as he was starting his own business.  And now I read it to my 18-month old, who seems to love it.  Maybe it's the rhymes and the pictures that my little one loves so much right now, but the message of the book is great for ALL ages.
0439023483|3.0|There was no ending to this book, not a final ending anyway.  It is going to be a series and if I had known I would've waited to read it.  The story was very good and I would have given it a great review if it had properly ended.  I do not like to be left hanging.  I purchased this book because it was recommended by Stephenie Meyer.  That's twice she's left me hanging (1/2 of Midnight Sun anyone...), but I can't seem to stop following her.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|This a borderline disgrace of the original Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory.  It's as if someone zapped the soul out of every character in this film.  Johnny Depp seemed like he was on vicodin or something.  One minute he was up, the next down.  His character went in and out of personalities.  Most of his jokes fell flat after their delivery, leaving the viewer with an uncomfortable CREEPY feeling.  His character of Willy Wonka was a cross between the church lady from Saturday Night Live and Jack from Will and Grace.  Does that tell you anything? Some of the dialogue was almost identical to the original, the only difference is they edited out all the wittiness that made the original so special.  All of the soul, intellect and attitude were missing from all of the characters portrayal's in this film.  There was an all across the board lack of emotion that resonated like a plague throughout the entire film. Some of the special affects were cute but even the sets seemed to lack the magical quality of the original Willy Wonka.  The musical numbers with the oompa loompas were surreal and did give a campy feel to the movie but overall this is a totally different movie than the original.  It's very difficult to compare the 2 of them but I will say the first one is heartfelt and magical.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a sour imitation, a souless, dour, unfunny tragedy. A sign of the times of what kind of world we're living in now.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Sweet after year AC/DC is back, and this album was worth the wait. Great stuff on here especialy tracks 6,7,8 and 16.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I waited for a long time for it's DVD's release and then i finally i saw it yesterday. And the movie is as good as i thought. I haven't seen the old FREAKY FRIDAY so i don't know how much the movies are alike except for the name. But i must say that the movie contains some shadows of \\"THE HOT CHICK\\". This movie covers two main characters Tess (Curtis) and Annabel (Lindsay Lohan). Who are always arguing with each other, simultaneously wish they could be someone else, they somehow exchange bodies, as they both learn what it's like to be in the other person's situation. As far as the acting concern Curtis and Lohan both did very well and it is very hard to judge who is better among the both. It is a family movie. I recommended it for all ages who love to watch fun.
B00005JPO1|1.0|After waiting so long to make this movie, you'd think that they would have had time to come up with a great idea and a great script. But apparently they spent the past 20 years looking for the worst idea and worst script they could find. This movie was made to make money. No real effort was put into it to make it live up to the previous movies. They knew that people would shell out money to see it regardless of whether it was good or bad. So why bother making it good? My advice? Don't give these people money for being too lazy to make a good Indiana Jones movie. Skip it. Don't even rent it, just pretend it never happened.
031606792X|1.0|I must admit, I was in denial that there were two camps - the 5 stars and the 1 star reviewers.  I had no choice but I had to read it even though  I was warned.  Let's just say, I am like Edward, drawn in, addicted, and curious.    I'm about 300 pages in and I see what people mean when they say they are gravely disappointed, frustrated, and upset.  This book from page one doesn't have the fluid style that made me love the other three.  None of the three previous books were perfect - in fact, far from, yet I felt so drawn into the story.  There was wonderful quality that made you curious.  With BD, I have to say it's frustrating how rushed the words come out as if the writer was just typing without thought.  The dialogue move without transparency in the characters.  If you read Twilight and even Edward's story, Midnight Sun, there is the natural flow that doesn't feel rushed, short, etc.  The characters do not jump out.  Their feelings seem flat.  And essence of Edward is lost.  It is as if his spirit is dead and cold.  It doesn't feel like Edward.  The dialogue, the thoughtful stares, the intense sincerity in his eyes are missing where as in the previous book, I felt that I knew him.  Everything about this book screams, rough draft.    IMMATURE.  NOVICE.  RUSHED.    I could write a better book.  SERIOUSLY.    ***SPOILER***  The honeymoon, the wedding, the pregnancy seem too contrived.  Where is the lovely details.  The beautiful dialogue.  Bella's thoughts.  The first night at Isle Esme is so disappointing.  I don't know what happened.    Can anyone explain how this book can be a 5 star?     I stopped reading when Edward tried to convince Jake to sleep with Bella.  What the xxxx?  This is absurd.  This is absolutely against character.  This is just horrific.  The worse worse plot device.  It is so absurd that Bella even thinks it's absurd for Edward to suggest it. I am horrified.  Disgusted is not adequate.    Yes, I am sure I will finish but I can't take the writing, the horrific plot twists, and lack of character development.  It's impossible that the 3 other books were written by the same author.  It feels like someone else was writing it all together and they just didn't understand who the characters were.    Not good.    Better off reading Midnight Sun.  If you read that rough draft against this, you will see the dramatic difference in the writing quality.      Sad and tragic attempt to make something HEA(happily ever after) when it just doesn't need to be.(I read the spoilers and can see where the writer is going!)
1433502437|5.0|I've been waiting for well over three years for Crossway to release the ESV Study Bible, and it was well worth the wait.    This is the single best Study Bible yet. I have had the NIV, TNIV and Nelson's NKJV Study Bibles, and this one beats them all hands down. There isn't even any comparison. The notes in this Bible are much, much better than Zondervan's NIV, or Nelson's NKJV. Also, the ESV translation is, in my opinion, the best modern translation you can get. It has a massive set of articles in the back of the Bible on everything from Christian Living, to the Interpretation of the Bible, Biblical Languages, etc. There are beautiful maps, and full-color illustrations throughout. The maps of Jerusalem and the Temple are incredible, far better than anything in the other Study Bibles that I mentioned (which are usually in black and white and far more primitive and crudely rendered).    I bought the Premium Calfskin version of the ESV Study Bible and the calfskin is beautiful, supple, the binding is fantastic and sturdy, and it lays open, flat, even on the first page.    You will love this Bible. I can't imagine myself using any other Bible or translation, after having this one. Crossways did an amazing job with this (and I have not been a fan of their prior Bibles, which have had lousy bindings and bad cover leather, etc).
0439023483|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer's, so when she suggested this book (The Hunger Games by, Suzanne Collins)on her website I looked into it. After receiveing the book I couldn't put it down. I can not wait for a second to find out more about Katniss Evergreen. She is now one of my (very few) favorite characters ever written. In my opinion, Collins (like Meyer) has a wonderful way of writing a fantastic alteration of reality and making the characters relatable. Needless to say, I enjoyed this book immensely.
0307455874|1.0|Perhaps some do not understand the implications of an Obama Presidency. Consider just three issues: unborn human life, terrorism, and poverty.<br /><br />Abortion:<br /><br />All humans are made in God's image and are such from conception. God forbids murder (unlawful killing). The killing of the unborn is, therefore, immoral and sinful--especially so, since they are utterly helpless. They are among \\"the least of these\\" that Jesus told us to care for. (I take abortion to save the life of the mother to not be sinful, but this accounts for only a minute percentage of abortions in the US).<br /><br />1. Obama would sign The Freedom of Choice Act if it comes to his desk. This would annul every state or local restriction on abortion in the 50 states.<br /><br />2. Obama would appoint several Supreme Court justices. They would be pro-choice with a vengeance, thus wiping out the possibility of reversing Roe v. Wade, which (along with Doe v. Bolton) opened the floodgates to abortion on demand in the United States. In other words, over 40,000,000 legal abortions in the United States since 1973.<br /><br />3. Obama would fund abortions through tax payer's money. That is chapter and verse from the Democratic Platform.<br /><br />4. Obama even opposed the ban on partial birth abortions, and would likely do what he could to bring them back. He opposed a born-alive statute in Illinois that would have allowed hospitals to save aborted babies that survived their own execution.<br /><br />5. Obama admits he is an ignoramus on when a fetus gets any human rights. It is \\"above his pay grade.\\" He has also said that we don't know when human life begins. This is a crock. Biology tells us life begins at conception (once a complete genetic code comes into being); since that life comes from humans, it is human life from conception. What else could it be? This is not difficult. But even if one is not sure when human life begins, that does not justify abortion on demand! We should, rather, err on the side of caution, given the momentous stakes at hand.<br /><br />The National Right to Life gave Obama a rating of o%--the worst possible. The National Abortion Rights Action League gave him a rating of 100%--the best possible. See their documentation of Obama and Biden's views on abortion.<br /><br />John McCain has become more pro-life recently. He said at Saddleback Community Church that the fetus has human rights from the beginning. He is the polar opposite of Obama on this, as is Sarah Palin.<br /><br />Terrorism:<br /><br />Evil is real in the world. The Bible does not forbid the use of force in a just cause. The innocent should be protected against attack.<br /><br />1. Obama has no military experience. In fact, he has anti-military associations, such as William Ayers, a confessed bomber of American military sites. Like most political liberals, he views terrorism as a criminal justice question, not one of military concern. He has opposed funding for the Iraq war and would likely lose that war if elected, thus turning Iraq into a bloodbath and likely a terrorist stronghold, with the Iranians reigning down on it like vultures. They are already supporting terrorism around the world.<br /><br />2. Obama views himself as a \\"world citizen\\" and would conform to international pressures rather than putting the US first. This would weaken us and make us more vulnerable to attack and lessen our ability to do good in the world.<br /><br />McCain is a military man and has served in the Senate for over twenty years, getting more experience on these matters. He supported the recently successful troop surge (when it was unpopular) and realizes we cannot pull out of Iraq until the job is done.<br /><br />The Poor:<br /><br />Some are deceived into thinking that political liberalism is better for the poor than conservatism. So, since the Bible tells us to care about the poor and the oppressed, we should support the Democrats. Not so fast. Saying you care about them andactually providing meaningful assistance are two different things. The liberal mindset is based on centralized, tax-funded programs. This slows down the economy and encourages dependence. This was the lesson of President Johnson's \\"War on Poverty.\\" Poverty won. Read Winning the Race by John McWhorter (an African American) on that.<br /><br />The conservative approach is to limit the power of the state, to cut taxes, and to give people more freedom to develop their skills and work on and give to the causes that concern them. It is not \\"Let them eat cake,\\" but is based on a different philosophy of economics.<br /><br />Moreover it is a leftwing fable that conservatives don't care about the poor. Studies show that conservatives give four times more to charity than do liberals. This is because liberals think the state should do this work, not individuals and private associations. (See Arthur C. Brooks, Who Really Cares? and The Acton Institute.)<br /><br />McCain has articulated his concerns to help those out of work get reeducated and those without adequate health coverage to have more options. However, he does not want to socialize medicine and create a huge bureaucracy.<br /><br />It is not an option to neglect the poor and marginalized. However, it is far from obvious that the Democrats have the best plan to help these people. They would certainly not help the unborn, the poorest and most marginalized of all.actually providing meaningful assistance are two different things.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|This movie will only appeal to a small audience. It's not what you're looking for if you want to see a good space thriller with intense special effects and bloody fights. Granted, it IS a space thriller with intense special effects and bloody fights, but it's only run-of-the-mill as far as the genre goes. \\"Sunshine\\" is best viewed as a spiritual drama told through the sci-fi medium, and it's good at that. But if you don't want to wade through the explosions and the gore to get to the religious themes, this is also not the movie for you.

1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon's curious book describes in the simplest prose what life is like when seen through the eyes of a 15 year-old autistic boy. The book's protagonist, Christopher, navigates daily life with charts, graphs, logic and truth.  Not so strange; until you realize as you read how little \\"normal\\" people notice the details in the world around them, and how much \\"normal\\" people lie during the course of a day, week, month, or year.<br /><br />If this book paints an accurate description of life with autism (and there seems to be ample evidence that it does), then I am astounded at the bravery that these individuals exhibit, as square pegs, trying to live their lives in a round-hole world.<br /><br />Christopher employs true creativity and imagination (although as an autistic person he argues that he has neither) to invent ways of coping with a confusing and often terrifying world.<br /><br />Exceptionally well done.<br /><br />C.A.Wulff -
0385340567|2.0|This is by far the weakest novel in the Jack Reacher series. Across twelve novels, Reacher has proved to be an extraordinarily appealing action hero: he's beholden to no one, with a morality that is perfectly internalized, and he's big enough and strong enough to kick butt whenever and wherever he needs to. Sure, it's formula fiction, but when it works, it's a pleasure. Until now, it has worked reasonably well to exceptionally well for Lee Childs, with four or five novels (Killing Floor, Die Trying, Tripwire, Echo Burning, One Shot) that are as good as anything in the action genre and the rest have been acceptable diversions. In the latest installment, Jack Reacher is hitchhiking in Colorado when he lands in a town that  just plain doesn't want him there.  Cops, muscle men, they all try to take him on, but why? Jack is puzzled. Eventually he goes to war against the town. (He always goes to war against the bad guys who oppose him.) But this time, it just isn't interesting. I wish it were.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|Sure, the first few songs have an 80's \\"pop\\" sound, but the whole album is not like these.  Even those songs have a lot more depth than typical 80's pop.  Some of the other songs, such as Perfect Symmetry, Black Burning Heart, or Love is the End would fit well on either of Keane's two other albums.  In the end, there are only 2 or 3 that I don't like, which I can find on just about ANY album.    Frankly, I don't necessarily want another album that sounds exactly like Hopes & Fears or Under the Iron Sea.
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut ****<br /><br />Long concidered to be Vonnegut's classic and best work as an author...I strongly disagree. This is far from his worst work but it doesn't hold a candle to [[ASIN:0385334206 Breakfast of Champions]] or [[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle]].<br /><br />The satire here is great. The commentary on War and what it does to those involved and those around them. Written about his own service in World War II and his own tribulations of being there and what it caused him afterward only done Kerouac style through fiction. It doesn't always work however.<br /><br />Often times the plot falters and feels boring. Readers will have trouble finishing the book if not familiar with Vonneguts work, but what saves it from being average is his over the top since of humour.<br /><br />What it offers a look into is brilliant but it doesn't always deliver, and for that it can never be a five star read.

B000V63CSU|4.0|I am surprised to see this album doesn't have a review. I purchased this back in '93 when it came out, and really enjoyed it. It was a good fill in while hoping for the next GNR album.  They managed to take the songs and make them their own, not just cheesy covers. Axl's vocals and Slash's typically great guitar work puts GNR's stamp all over these songs. Most of the songs seem to be the guys having fun putting their spin on some old punk songs and a few classic rock tunes. It is pulled off so well that you can pretty much just imagine that is is an album of tunes from Guns.  I highly recommend this to folks who liked GNR and miss them these days. If you don't have it, you need it.
0385341075|2.0|The coming of age novel of 13-year-old Matilda against the backdrop of a endless, bloody civil war in the early 1990s where Redskin soldiers terrorize the population and the rebels to re-establish New Guinea's sovereignty. The only white man left on the island, Mr. Watts, becomes the teacher for the island children, alternating his lessons between reading from Dickens \\"Great Expectations\\" and and short lectures by mothers about mundane, sometimes practical matters. Matilda is attracted to the alternative life and character of Pip, and uses the Dickens novel to distract her from the daily horrors and hopelessness of the island natives who seem to have been forgotten by the world.    From beginning to end, I found reading the book a chore because it lacked character development other than in superficial, black and white terms. In addition, for me, the books was simplistic and lacked depth in that the major idea explored was that of using literature to transcend earthly realities and circumstances. A secondary theme, the complicated development of the mother-daughter relationship, was relatively simplistic as well and not explored in any great depth.    Ordinarily, when reading a book that entirely captivates me, I dread reaching the end. With this book, I kept counting the number of pages to the end, and was usually disappointed that many pages still remained long after my interest had waned and become indifferent.
B001G5IJVK|3.0|For young (or new) members of the KISS Army, this is a nice package to start with. Packaging classic tunes according to the band member who sang them is unique (even on the lengthy list of KISS compilations). And KISS remains one of the few rock bands where picking a \\"favorite\\" band member is part of the culture. So enjoy the itemization.     But once again, those who chose the tracks also chose to ignore come \\"Klassic Kiss\\" performed by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons after Ace Frehley and Peter Criss left the band. A complete Paul selection would have to include \\"Lick It Up\\" and \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" (with consideration to \\"Forever,\\" \\"Tears Are Falling,\\" and \\"Everytime I Look At You\\"). As for the Demon, no Gene compilation is complete without \\"I Love It Loud\\" or \\"Domino\\" (\\"War Machine\\" and \\"Unholy\\" belong, too).
0312979479|4.0|\\"Ten little Indian boys went out to dine...\\"    And so starts the nursery rhyme that was the basis for Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (also published as Ten Little Indians). The story opens with 8 people from all walks of life traveling to Indian Island, where they have been invited for a summer holiday by the mysterious U.N. Owen. Upon reaching the island, they discover that their mystery host is no where to be found; the only other people on the island are the butler and his wife. The guests are soon confronted with the reason for their invitation: their host knows about the secrets of their pasts, and has decided that justice must be served.    Truthfully, of the little Christie that I have read so far, this has been my least favorite. Don't misunderstand, however, I still greatly enjoyed the book! Christie's knack for misdirection is amazing, leading you to believe with utmost certainty who the killer is, at least until the next chapter when she sheds new light on a new suspect, and then you know for sure that they are the killer, again until the next chapter. What I didn't like about this book is the murders seemed too contrived and forced to match up with the nursery rhyme. Of course, these murders needed to fit the pattern of the rhyme, otherwise, what would be the point? It just came across as too convenient for me, yet I did enjoy flipping back and forth to the rhyme at the beginning of the book to try to figure out how the next murder would take place!
B000WO251Q|5.0|Dear John could arguably be Spark's best novel to date.  As perhaps the greatest love storyteller of our time, the New York Times Best Seller tops even his own works.<br /><br />Dear John attempts tells a story of true love and loss and all of the emotions that go along with them.  Set in modern times, it paints an accurate picture of post-9/11 life and its effect on relationships.<br /><br />In gripping detail, Spark's lays out the story of John and Savannah and a summer romance that would last until the end of time.  But love is not without its tragedies, and these two would be faced with the hardest ones of all.  Would their love be strong enough to survive?  Or would time and distance allow love to be overcome by everyday adversities?  What sacrifice would be too much to ask?<br /><br />In the end, both Savannah and John learn the true meaning of love.  Both learn all too well, that love can only be valued by what you would give to show it.<br /><br />A true must-read that will tug at the very fabric of your heart.

I not ashamed to say that I loved the black album, but ...Justice... 'Lightning and 'Puppets were sheer genius for their time.  I kept wondering what had happened and why Metallica served up a decade of crap.  I am happy to say all that is over now.  Metallica has managed to incorporate a newer more modern sound with the power and emotion from yesteryear.  There is still a hint of pop in some of the choruses but I can handle that and it actually fits.  Lets just hope they stick to this path instead of a new sound every album!

0375826726|3.0|Although on the whole I enjoyed Brisingr, I found it much slower than the previous volumes. The extremely detailed background information, the long journeys and constant brooding by our hero was often more tedious than entertaining. If I actually had to recount what happened during this book, I could explain it to you in a few sentences. Remember Mr. Paolini, that good editing is crucial to an enthralling story. Given all that, it was still a good read, and yes, I'll have to read the final chapter.
0143038583|2.0|Do not, repeat, do not believe the majority of reviews about this book. I should've known better as I first read \\"Botany of Desire\\", and gave a review. I thought that book was interminable, and this is even worse. Don't get me wrong there is some information within the pages, however, it goes on and on, almost without end. I persisted till I was almost, but not quite finished, and just could no longer bear the boredom. I persevered through \\"The Corn\\", barely got through \\"The Grasses\\", and almost made it through \\"The Forest\\", but the story on Fungi got the best of me, and \\"The Perfect Meal\\" did me in. I actually put the book down and stated aloud, \\"enough - I can't take it anymore\\". Life is too short, and time too valuable to waste it on this tripe.

Fast moving - action - kept my interest throughout. The story moves easily from start to finish. The theme: time, and ones ability to see ahead - not really unique, however, with a \\"different twist\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed. Both Ms. Moore and Ms. Biel had important roles, however, were shadowed by Mr. Cage who was really in his element.

0375701427|5.0|This brilliant work of Art has many themes.  It resonated with me as an examination of dreams because I am of the generation of the Swede's daughter, Merry, and because I knew the dream of his generation through my parents and the adults I knew growing up.  So I can look at the dreams of two generations of Americans through Roth's eyes and through my own.  My conclusion is that the emotional power of this novel for me is almost unprecedented.      Unlike some reviewers, I like the Swede very much.  I don't know how I would have felt about him when I was young, and, like his daughter, intolerant of the love and dedication his generation had for what America had accomplished up to that time.  But today, examining his values through the prism of my own life experience, I respect him greatly.      There were times when I hated Roth for what he put the Swede through.  The Swede is almost like Job:  a righteous man tested beyond the breaking point for no reason other than the examination of his values.  Do his values stand the test?  It seems to me that our dreams, like our hopes, are not to be carefully compared to the facts of our existence to determine their validity.  If the Swede's dream is thus examined, it fails the test of reality dismally.  On the other hand, as a dream, it is beautiful.  The power of this novel for me is in Roth's even-handed and masterful portrayal of the Swede's love of his prosaic life.  There is incredible beauty in a life well lived as portrayed with great respect by the normally irreverent Philip Roth.  Whatever else this novel is, it is a great work of Art.      The greatest criticism this novel makes of the Swede is that he does not stop to examine and dissect life.  He just lives it.  He always tries to make the best of it.  The novel could be read as an indictment of the philosophy of trying to make the best of everything and everyone we ecounter in life.  On a personal level, this idea would resonate with me.  But the Swede is such anattractive, archetypal representative of this philosophy that I found myself rooting for him.  For me, the book does ultimately vindicate the Swede's approach to life.  Certainly the representatives of the alternative point of view are much less attractively protrayed than the Swede.  So maybe the lesson is that we all lose to life in the end.  The test of how well we have lived is not in the ending but in the living itself.  This test the Swede passes.  A lovely, sad, powerful novel.
B00005N6KG|4.0|A few other reviewers were helpful in that they used these headphones exclusively for running which is what I was most interested in.  Ear buds fall out of my ears.    I found these headphones to be very lightweight, much more comfortable than ear buds and most importantly they were stable and stayed put even at speeds up to 10mph.  They even have a decent sound to boot!
B001B71NOI|4.0|...but sadly the album contains \\"only\\" 7 so called \\"real\\" songs. The first track, intro, \\"999,999\\" is really nothing special when you compare it to \\"Pinion\\" from Broken EP. \\"Corona Radiata\\" is just dull and seems like somewhat leftover from Ghosts I-IV, so does the third instrumental track \\"The Four Of Us Are Dying\\".  The best tracks from the Slip are in my opinion definetly \\"1,000,000\\", \\"Discipline\\" and \\"Demon Seed\\".  The reheasal DVD is superb, although a little bit too short. The songs from this album sound much better in live and show that band has so much energy and hatred left after all these years, even though shows are nowadays pretty lame compared to \\"Self Destruct Tour\\" and the live performance at Woodstock '94.  Still, really good album and definetly worth buying and not just for HC NIN-fans. But the stickers are SOOO vain and ugly. Argh!
0385338724|2.0|I listened to the audio book, the abridged edition. I'm glad I didn't waste my time on the unabridged. I guess it was supposed to be humerous, but I found it dumb, the characters, the dialogue. They're too over the top. Ridiculous. Not worth the time.
B000002HMH|3.0|Okay, I'm going through the inevitable re-assessment of Metallica's catalog that comes with every new album. With Load, I have the same opinion that I did ten years ago: if this album had been made by anyone else, it would have been hailed as a great ROCK album. Problem is, Metallica spent all those years putting out truly epic, towering songs. After their 1st four albums (lets just ignore BLACK) anything other than truly legendary thrash built on mathematically precise, wonderfully layered foundations sounds weak and pathetic.   The songs on this album are good. I spent a lot of time listening to it and still go back every once in a while. I, like everyone else (or at least everyone who was around for the old stuff and has good taste) would have preferred MORE of the old sounding stuff. That being said, what's here is good music and should be judged on it's own merits rather than being trashed because of what its not.
0060833459|5.0|In this short book are some of the most trenchant, clearly-written statements on how to be an effective executive ever written. It contains some philosophical statements, more real-world examples, and most importantly, it details actions the executive can take to become immediately effective.  I wish I had read this 20 years ago!    Other books like Good To Great and Built To Last are excellent, too, but are more strategic. This is the tactical book, beautifully and concisely written.  If you want to be effective, buy this book now.  It is brilliant.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. The overall story was great. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that there was going to be a fourth book to the series. Itwould have been much better if Eragon would have fought Galbatorix in this book rather than having to wait probably another couple years for the fourth to hit the shelves in Borders. But other than that i enjoyed reading book three in the series.

B00111YM5G|3.0|Action movie/thriller/drama about the purgatory - concept of the world \\"in between\\" where souls of the dead humans are being judged and fending for their place in the paradise, or surrendering to the eternal hell.  Keepers of the each place are angels - the good ones serving light and the bad ones serving darkness.  But listening to these angels argue their position on joining one side vs. another is almost like listening to the premise on why one should work for the corporation vs. working as an independent consultant.  Other interesting premises such as a good angel that is killed by a bad angel (and vice versa) simply dies for the eternity.  These creatures have no souls to take them into a next world, or another body as it is the case with humans.  Angel fallen from the grace (like the one who no longer has wings) is basically turned into a human.  They are punished to live human life with all of its hardships but there is hope that their souls will continue to live. I was turned off by the character of Jade - fallen good angel, turned prostitute.  This would be a beautifu actress if someone can teach her to keep her mouth closed.  Her perpetually open mouth (either her teeth are too big, or she is not using her nose to breathe) make her character too vulgar even for a role of the prostitute, let alone angel.  Standard flight scenes, miracle works and good conquering evil motifs make this film way too predictable.
0446607274|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br /> Don't read this then whine about spoiling the reveal.<br /><br />First what I didn't like:  uses \\"nodded\\" too much, another \\"cop gone bad\\" story which is an overused ploy and one of Connelly's favorites.<br /><br />What I did like is that it was well done with good characterizations.  Dialogue good, plot good although predicatble (we all knew it was a cop who did it from the very beginning).<br /><br />Old story but well done.<br /><br />Pretty good effort overall.
B000QQFKYE|3.0|This movie is experimental fiction in nature, closer to Eraserhead than Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks. As always, Lynch uses confusing imagery and haphazard plot direction throughout the movie, but this time he seems to be testing how far he can push the audience. This movie is both confusing, shocking, and at times, rather comical.    The number of complexities involved in the branching (and somewhat parallel) plot lines, and the fact that the movie itself is at least partly about making movies, make a synopsis virtually impossible to relate. I would be hard pressed to describe what this movie is about to a friend except to say that it is loosely about an actress in a movie that loses her ability to determine whether she is experiencing reality or in a movie.    The whole movie seems a lot like a series of dreams (or nightmares) that were woven together with a fictional backdrop in order to create a connection between the dreams.    This movie needs a few glasses of wine to go with it and it is somewhat enjoyable, especially if you like a movie like Eraserhead or Muholland Drive. If such movies only frustrate you, you may want to steer clear of this one.
B001F0RAL6|2.0|Like we couldn't figure out less than half way through that this wasn't a terrorist plot but a murder done to look like one.  Who would want to murder the Dr.?  Wifey of course, she acted wierd from the beginning anyway.  How could she murder Dr. and stage it to look like terrorism?  With the help of yet another \\"gone bad\\" law enforcement officer.      The book is little else than Bosch and the FBI running around chasing false clues.    Two things about Connelly's writing that I am getting really tired of seeing:  1. use of the word \\"nodded\\" people are nodding constantly sometime three or four times a page, 2. Cop or ex cop turned killer.  I think he has used this in quite a few books now, enough already!    I will not be buying any more Connelly.  I will be getting them all from the library.  If he is turning into another Robert Parker, then I am not interested.

Even though it was about immigrant families from West Bengal (which I have never visited) living mostly on the East Coast of America (in cities and towns I have never heard of), she created a sense of association, call it connection, with the characters.     The little girl torn between two different cultures at home and at school, the teenager struggling in college and thereafter to prove herself, the accomplished professional resigning to an arranged marriage \\"to fix it\\", the expectant mom of a toddler, the parents wanting their kids to have the best of both worlds... they all hit home for this particular audience.

B000002UA5|5.0|This is a CLASSIC album from Pink Floyd. I've loved it since it's release.     Not only do you have live tracks of songs from their earliest albums (A Saucerful of Secrets, Astronomy Domine, etc.), but you have a suite of pieces each from Richard Wright (Sysyphus, Parts 1-4), David Gilmour (The Narrow Way, Parts 1-3), and Nick Mason (The Grand Vizier's Garden Party, Parts 1,2, & 3). ...Ans don't miss Roger Waters' 2 pieces: Grantchester Meadows and the inimitable (not that any have tried, to my knowledge) Several Species of Small Furry Aninals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict!     This album covers Floyd's gamut up to the time of its release (1969) and presages their future from that vantage point. A MUST purchase for anyone wanting to know Pink Floyd from all sides.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|If you are looking for 'earthquake' shaking bass, then get this movie. If your system can handle it this is a \\"DEMO\\"--show off your system quality soundtrack. If one complains that the bass is \\"boomy\\" it is because their SUB cannot handle the volume of EXTREME lows. From the opening credits and all throughout this film my concrete foundation shook with clean powerful gut-punching bass. The 24 bit DTS HD MA sound is reference quality. The sound design is reference quality. The use of surrounds is in a word \\"involving\\". It draws one into the action. Subtle (and not so subtle) surround usage brings the action aggressively into your room. You will find yourself ducking as Bullseye works his evil, deadly aim. If you can, engage the EX on your system, you will add another dimension to this excellent soundtrack. (In addition to my system sub, I have a 15\\" sub dedicated to the \\"surround\\" channels that thunders with this track)    And while the video is not quite up to the audio standard, this film, which is shot mostly at night, reveals very good shadow detail and exhibits inky blacks without black crush. Day shots can be soft, but not enough to distract. The FX of Daredevil's \\"radar\\" sound produces a CGI visual explosion as it details what his visual mind extracts from his ultra sensitive hearing.    The director's cut explores more character development than the theatrical cut. It makes the storyline more personal on all levels. It reveals the \\"story\\" behind the story. The pace is somewhat slower, but that slower pace raises the tension in the action scenes. Getting the detail on a character's motivation simply makes for better story telling. If you're looking for non-stop slam bang comic book action, then you might want to stay with the theatrical cut, which unfortunately is not available at this time on BD.
0765316897|5.0|If you read and liked the first two books in the Mistborn series, Hero of Ages is a must read!  However, prepare for a big emotional wallop.  It has been a long time since a book affected me this much, and I have to admit I felt like I had been hit by a truck by the time I was finished.  And, I would gladly do it again. But only because I felt that everything would be all right. Finally. :)  It actually took me a few days to get to this point. I don't think anyone who reads HOA will be left unmoved. This one of the few books that I know I will enjoy picking up for a reread or two. (Probably as soon as I finish this review.) It is complex, intense, with no holes in the plot, and as realistic as fantasy gets. I absolutely loved the way Sanderson makes the characters come so vividly alive and easy to connect with. I know they aren't real but I'll miss them just the same. For me, the ending was brilliantly balanced between a sense of completion and a feeling that there is more to experience in that world.  This is why I keep reading fantasy, every once in a while a story comes along that is fresh, well written, and takes me to a completely new and astonishing world that makes me look at my own in a new way. It's kind of like a vacation to a far off exotic place for under $30.    And my one big gripe, ............ After that, what am I going to read now??????
1400064287|5.0|This book is recommended reading for everyone who delivers presentations: it analyzes why certain stories \\"stick\\" in people's mind, and why others disappear, almost independent of the content: it's they way that they are told that matters.<br /><br />- Keep them simple without creating silly sound bites<br />- Add unexpected twists to keep people interested<br />- Be specific and avoid fluffy hollow statements (Dilbert mission generator style)<br />- Be credible to get people to believe your idea<br />- Add emotion to make people care<br />- Tell stories<br /><br />The book is written as a set of stories that are analyzed following the above framework.

031606792X|5.0|I have read the bad reviews, I have read the good reviews, and I must say that I loved Breaking Dawn.  Is it Shakespearean -- no (although I enjoyed the references throughout the series). Was it a delicious, happy ending to a fun saga? Yes.      I read the books all in a row, having discovered the series after  Breaking Dawn was published. Maybe my lack of anticipation helped me to see the books for what they are instead of building up the possibilities to impossible heights. I really can't understand the reviewers who desperately wanted Bella to suffer. Does there have to be death in a story to make it realistic? I was thrilled that Edward and Bella's struggle was resolved and that they are able to have some peace.  It did my heart good, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. I was happy to know how Stephenie Meyer wanted it to end and I was able to put my own views aside in order to enjoy hers.     Please don't be dissuaded from reading Breaking Dawn by people who either wanted a tragic ending, Jacob to be chosen as Bella's love interest, or people who simply could not allow themselves to go along for the ride.  Breaking Dawn was a fitting ending to an intoxicating series.

B001DHXT20|4.0|Back in the seventies television attempted to bring the story of the Incredible Hulk, Marvel Comics gargantuan green goliath to the small screen. It succeeded in telling not the story of just the monster but of the man inside, trying to find a way to stop the dangerous beast inside.<br /><br />In 2005, we had another version arrive, this time directed by Ang Lee. While Lee is noted for his storytelling ability, there was no way he was the man to bring this character to the big screen. Plotlines were change to accommodate the times and the director leaving fans with a less than favored film.<br /><br />This year director Louis Letterrier who worked with Corey Yuen on THE TRANSPORTER and directed THE TRANSPORTER 2, takes over and finally give the monster his due. With touching scenes between ill fated lovers and fight sequences that have to be seen to be believed, this film finally does the tale justice.<br /><br />The film semi-bypasses the last by giving us glimpses of the creation of the Hulk. Gamma radiated scientist Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) has no chance of stopping the release of his inner rage in the form of the giant green monster that dwells within. Somewhat of a take on the old Jekyll and Hyde story, the Hulk destroys his lab and injures the love of his life, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler).<br /><br />The Hulk also incurs the wrath of the man behind the project, Gen. \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross (William Hurt). Warning Banner to stay away from Betty, his daughter, Banner heads out. When he realizes Ross wants what is inside to use as a weapon, he leaves.<br /><br />We learn all of this from the credits as the story unfolds with no dialogue. We end in Brazil with Banner working in a soft drink bottling plant and messaging back and forth with a \\"Mr.Blue\\" as he continues to search for a cure. But Gen. Ross gets a lead on him and sends in the troops to capture him, led by Maj. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).<br /><br />Blonsky fails to capture Banner/The Hulk but is fascinated with what he saw. Demanding to be put in the loop, he eventually convinces Ross to use him as a guinea pig in a process that may result in a soldier with the power to take down the Hulk.<br /><br />After Banner reunites with Betty, Ross finds him and a clash is at hand. Cornered, Banner turns once move into the Hulk on a small Virginia college campus. With soldiers and a ton of firepower behind them as well as the now enhanced Blonsky, the Hulk takes to the battlefield. It is only when he fears for Betty's safety that he finds the strength to turn the tide, running off with Betty in hand.<br /><br />Now an accomplice to Banner's attempt to find a cure, Betty aids him in an attempt to unite with Mr. Blue to find the cure. At the same time, Blonsky finds himself altering even more. When he gets Mr. Blue to provide the same sort of radiation that Banner suffered, he becomes the Abomination, a nearly unstoppable creature that perhaps only the Hulk can stop.<br /><br />The film moves back and forth on three levels. The first and most obvious is the monster whose rampages leave in their wake a ton of destruction. The second is the unrequited love story between Banner and Betty. And the last is the story of a man literally possessed who seeks release.<br /><br />The acting in this film is fantastic as two dimensional characters are given life on screen. Norton not only looks the part but turns in a performance that ranges from rage to pathos, at times showing an almost unbearable sadness in little more than a look. Tyler does a great job as well, offering a love interest that cares deeply about the man she loves. Hurt and Roth both do a commendable job as well, but leave their characters in their two dimensional forms offering little more.<br /><br />The CGI used to simulate the Hulk is top of the line. It is like a seamless painting where the entire landscape is laid before your eyes. You will believe that this creature exists. Even CGI haters have found this portrayal excellent.<br /><br />A great story, acting on top of it's game, effects that rival almost any seen and the comic book creation brought to screen in a tribute that pays homage to the original source rather than attempt to make it something it is not. You get it all with this package. And while I liked this summer's IRON MAN much more, this movie does offer escapist entertainment at its best.and the comic book creation brought to screen in a tribute that pays homage to the original source rather than attempt to make it something it is not.

B001GZ6QDS|1.0|TRASH!!! This REALLY DESERVES a ZERO!!!!!<br /><br />I love Tim Burtons Batman. They were very artsy and DARK & just great. Joel did an OK job and despite the fact that Batman is not BLONDE (Val Kilmer) i was still able to watch the horrific Batman Foeever and Batman & Robin because it was silly brainless campy fun.<br /><br />I went into Batman Begins thinking its great that Batman is dark again. But walked out the theater feeling it was missing something. I gave Batman another chance with the Dark Knight and after watching the new movie i finally realized what that missing certain something was. It was that Nolan made Batman into a COP film. Theres a difference between a COP film & a Super Hero film. And please dont tell me Batman is a cop because he is a detective etc and that he is not a super hero because he has no magic powers. I already GET THAT!! The bottom line is the movie was AWFUL. If i wanted 2 see a COP film i would go ahead and RENT HEAT with Robert DeNiro. On top of that i hate the freakin BATMAN COSTUME. The ears are so close together i kept thinking they were gonna touch each other. On top of that Bale puts on some AWFL Italian Brooklyn accent everytime he is in the Batman Costume!!! I asked everybody that saw this movie and they still have no idea what the asian guy was going to do with the money or his purpose in the film or why he even wanted the money. They have no idea what that subplot was about. JUST AWFUL on every ASPECT!!!!!!! AWFUL!!!!!<br /><br />Almost 2 1/2 hours of my life i will never get back!!!!!

But this movie was great it had good actors and actress's in it and really aside from the civilians who die in the Pearl Harbor bombing only one good guy dies.  This is much better then allot of the war movies I've seen in the past like \\"Enemy At The Gates\\", \\"Hamburger Hill\\", \\"Red Dawn\\", and \\"The Longest Day\\" (quite possibly the most boring war movie ever created).  It is much much more then just a bunch of stupid world war 2 battles.

1416594884|5.0|I've loved John Le Carre ever since I picked up \\"Smiley's People\\" many years ago. Initially I was drawn to him because of his repeat character, an English spy named George Smiley (Smiley is a family name, but also a fairly common English/Scottish last name since the Jacobite rebellion of 1745, so to my sorrow, George Smiley and I are not related. Also he's fictional) but I continued reading because of his intense social consciousness and the simple fact that he has never, ever, written a bad book.    I was ecstatic that through the vine program I was able to read his latest book \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" before it came out in stores. And as always, Le Carre didn't disappoint. His latest novel on the war on terror is thrilling, suspenseful and incredibly enlightening about the loss of human rights and the de-humanization of Muslims which has accompanied the war. In spite of the somewhat black nature of the book (the truth can be bleak and awful) I couldn't put this gripping novel down. Though \\"The Little Drummer Girl\\" will always remain my favorite of Le Carre's books, this is a must read.    Five stars and as always I look forward to the next book.

0061020710|4.0|I've been collecting the Discworld books in no particular order for a few years now, mostly because my father always had an affinity for them and recommended them as hilarious and entertaining at the same time. Now that I finally got to read the first in the series I can see what the fuss is all about! There is plenty of humor, dry wit and magic, extremely complex scientific and fantastic themes and myriad of characters brighter than all the rainbows and flowers in the world combined. My head was spinning after few pages but somehow I couldn't stop reading; this incredible journey that Pratchett invites the reader on takes some time to get adjusted to, but once I let my mind go and read it slow, it all melted into a fantasy like no other. I can't really imagine kids reading it unless they are prodigies at understanding language because their little brains might pop from the amount of information given; I know mine was taken for a spin a few times!    So here we are, visiting a world that exists as a flat disc with water walling over the edges, carried by four giant elephants standing on an ancient turtle, covered in meteor holes and all sorts of space debris, swimming who knows where....In one of it's cities, Ankh-Morpork , a failed wizard by the name of Rincewind comes across Twoflower, a traveling little man with magical luggage, carved out of rare sapient pear tree that follows him everywhere on its tiny feet. Yes walking luggage, with teeth too, guarding his master and providing lots of entertainment through out the story. The two men are the only ones in the whole city who speak the same language and thus their zany adventures start. Hastily hired as a guide the magician, who sucks at magic but it awfully funny and likable, gets into all sorts of troubles with trolls, dragons, islands with lunatics chased by Death itself without trying to loose poor Twoflower who thinks the whole adventure as a great sight seeing trip, they escape all sorts of scenarios that take them form the murkiest depths of underwater caves into far away galaxies in deep space.    Seems like a lot and it is, but the novel takes all sorts of turns ad twists and one never knows what awaits our heroes on the next page. When Gods play magic dice and Fate and Death are in talks of getting them, our characters have a lot at stake and loosing such charming little fellows would certainly be horrible so the reader is constantly kept on a tight leash as the beauty of the story and its intricate pattern morphs into more fantastic scenarios. I can't even clearly say what this book is about other than being simply fantastic, albeit very complex. Folklore, mythology, fairy tales, comedy and drama, it's all here exquisitely woven for those who dare.    - Kasia S.

0525478183|5.0|I'm not gonna lie, this is full of 18 year old guy humor. Nerdy 18 year old guy humor, but still. I've been 18 and a nerd, but not a guy, but that doesn't make it any less laugh out loud-able. Or math class ignore-able. But I didn't tell you that.  Hilarity aside, John Green has vibrant, living characters once again. This book is not bound together with glue and stuff, it's bound with awesome. This is an exceptional YA read because it doesn't dumb down to an an assumed average intelligence of a Young Adult audience.
0307269752|5.0|This was a \\"required\\" read for me, as it was chosen by my bookclub.  I read the first 50 pages or so and my head was spinning.  There were SO many names (and it didn't help this was translated from Sweedish, so they were not 'typical names').  But, once I got all the people sorted out in my head, I could not put this one down.  I gasped out loud and found myself thinking about what was going to happen next while I was away from the book.  The 'ending' happened about 50 pages or so before the book was over, but it was still a good ending.  Then I closed the book and found myself thinking about the people and wishing I knew more.  Glad I found out this was the first in a Trilogy!  It makes even more sense now that things ended the way they did.  The 2nd Book, The Girl Who Played with Fire will be available in the US in July 2009, but I \\"cheated\\" and went to Amazon.co.uk and they are releasing it in January 2009, so I preordered it from them.<br />Glad I read it, look forward to the 2nd one.  The translation was sometimes off (spelling of words and such) but it had no impact.
0802714544|5.0|The Spy Who Came in From the Cold has been heralded as one of the greatest spy novels ever.  John LeCarre, a British Intelligence agent who served during the Cold War until his identity was given to the Russians by double agent Kim Philby, wrote this timeless classic in 1963.  It covers the story of Alec Leamas, as an agent, friend, spy, lover, and killer.  Leamas takes on a mission to defeat his nemesis Mundt in East Germany, knowing full well it may be his last.  Le Carre wrote his novel as a conduit from which he could communicate his viewpoints on matters dealing with morals, politics, ideology, and world affairs.  Le Carre was able to do this without all the blood and gadgets so commonly found in your typical spy novel, and in the process, convey much deeper principles.     The novel was a quick and intense read; one that packed quite a punch.  The intensity comes not from the blazing guns of a secret agent, but the dialogue, treachery, deception, mind games, and aggression expressed by the many rounded and dynamic characters.  Those looking for a bloodbath or risqué spy novel will not find it here.  LeCarre tells his story with limited exposure to violence and sex, which made the story more raw and realistic.  The true catch of the story is the game of cat and mouse; the never-ending cycle of espionage that winds up enveloping the lives of both participants and innocents.  The life and nature of spy work is portrayed quite convincingly and one has to wonder how much of it came from LeCarre's own wartime experiences.  My father served in the intelligence community, and it's my knowledge of his experiences there that made me impressed with the way LeCarre's novel exposed the moral dilemmas and paradoxes associated with the perilous work of espionage.  As a political science major, I found the book was a metaphor for many schools of thought dealing with world politics and human nature.     Some would complain that LeCarre's novel is all about people's feelings, is too cold, or does not have enough action packed fight scenes.  They are exactly right, and those who say it takes away from the novel are missing the point.  This book was written to show the world that spy work is unglamorous, unrewarding, uncertain, immoral, and cold.  It serves as a reality check to those who are fascinated by spy work because they see movies like James Bond.  It exposes the real world, where there is no definitive good and bad.  It makes us question our own actions.  Luckily for us, not all literature or film is created for pure entertainment value.  Sometimes there is a brain behind the final product.   The Spy Who Came In From the Cold conveys the tragedies of war, along with the intensity of forbidden love, revenge, and betrayal.  Once you pick up LeCarre's novel you will not be able to put it down.  Finally doing so leaves you begging for more.

B00005JPO1|5.0|I have all four of the Indiana Jones series. I found this probably final entry very entertaining and worthy of the Indiana Jones story and series. If I had to rate the four collections I would rate as follows # 1 Raiders of Lost Ark, # 2 Last Crusade, # 3 The Crystal Skull and final # 4 Temple of Doom. It was nice to see Karen Allen back in the story as I believe she and Harrison Ford share a chemistry.I also am amazed at the athletetic ability of Harrison Ford who is in his mid 60's. Karen Allen is also still very \\"Hot\\" I wish Hollywood would continue to make these just plain old fun and entertaining movies than this over rate high techno junk that seems to plague the movie enthusists. Hope you find this as entertaining and fun as I did, just don't over analyse and just have fun.

B00003CXDV|5.0|I know - you've already seen a dozen other reviews that say Galaxy Quest is a wonderful send-up of the original Star Trek TV Series.  As someone who is a HUGE Star Trek fan, I can assure you, it is, and very well done.<br /><br />What really makes this movie work is not that it's a Star Trek parody.  The magic is in the thoughtful and well written examination of the world of those trapped in roles from a show long dead: hating what they've become, but where the only way to survive is off the microscopic income they get from conventions, \\"special appearances\\" and such that come their way due to their fame as a character from the show \\"Galaxy Quest\\".  The movie quickly makes it clear that our characters are in this situation and hate it: they hate the show, hate themselves, and hate each other.<br /><br />Well, at least on the surface they hate each other: they've been together for decades, and so have long standing grudges, know every one of each other's warts and quirks, and know what buttons to push to end an argument (or start one).  It's like a dysfunctional family: they can't stand each other, but know that they're all in it together.  To put it another way, and as is emphasized by a statement from the character \\"Malthesar\\" early in the film, the TV show portrayed a crew that worked together in perfect harmony, trust and respect of each other.  Yet, the actors behind those roles are living a life far from the ideals they once portrayed.<br /><br />The leader of the crew is Tim Allen, who's character, Jason Nesmith plays a very self-centered and Shatneresque \\"Commander Peter Quincy Taggart\\" of the Starship \\"Galaxy Quest.\\"  He alone of the show's cast enjoys living in the past, and is center stage in every guest appearance.  He loves the attention and glory it seems to bring, but is not above stealing some of that glory from his fellow cast members.  Yet, even he, early in the film, is inescapably confronted with the fact that he's also a washed up has been.<br /><br />Salvation comes in the form of REAL (!) aliens (apparently) disguised as Galaxy Quest groupies who track down \\"Commander Taggert\\" at a convention to ask for his help.  These Thermians have no idea that the broadcasts of  \\"historical documents\\" about the crew of the Starship Galaxy Quest that they've been watching are, in fact, ficton.  The concept of fiction (and deceit) is totally foreign to them.<br /><br />An equally clueless and hung-over Jason (Allen) goes along for a ride with the Thermians, thinking he'll be visiting yet another cardboard recreation of the ship's set, but finds out that what he thought was just another bunch of fans to be treated with contempt, are in fact the real thing.<br /><br />Back on earth, he invites his castmates along to see.  They (of course) think he's finally cracked, but needing the money, they follow along; and the fun begins.<br /><br />I'm always looking for movies where there's growth in the characters and a lesson to be learned.  Slapstick humor without purpose is, to me, not worth the effort it takes to watch.  There needs to be growth, there needs to be some reason the characters are going through the situation we are seeing them in.<br /><br />Fortunately, Galaxy Quest does not disappoint on this score: you see our characters come to the realization that all this is real.  They try to \\"act\\" their way through the crisis that their desperate Thermian Hosts recruited them to solve, and quickly find that acting doesn't work in real life.  This is played all the way through with just the right mix of the ridiculous combined with the sublime.<br /><br />Once all seems lost, we see the Galaxy Quest actors pull together, learn from their mistakes, overcome their fears and insecurities, and really act like a team (just as their TV alter egoes always did); and (of course) save the day.<br /><br />The cast for this movie is seasoned and impressive, and do a superb job.  In addition to Tim Allen who does a great send-up of William Shatner, we have Sigourney Weaver (\\"Ghost Busters\\") as Gwen Demarco playing the the absolute antihesis of her \\"Ripley\\" character in Aliens.  Alan Rickman (\\"Snape\\" in \\"Harry Potter\\") does an excellent job as a Shakespearean actor resentfully playing the alien Dr. Lazarus.  Tony Shalhoub (from the TV series \\"Monk\\") is phenomonal as the ultra laid back engineer \\"Fred Kwan\\", and Daryl Mitchell does an excellent job portraying a now grown up former child star \\"Tommy Mitchell\\".<br /><br />Two (at the time) newcomers in the cast were Justin Long as a teenage and nerdy Galaxy Quest groupie - later to become well known for his role as \\"Mac\\" in the Apple \\"Macintosh\\" ads.  Finally, and stealing nearly every scene he's in is Sam Rockwell as a slightly neurotic wannabe actor \\"Guy Fleegman\\".<br /><br />This film didn't win any major industry awards, but, like most Tim Allen films are, combines comedy with a moral lesson: It does it well, and hits its intended target dead on.  For that reason, I give it five stars.ng the the absolute antihesis of her \\"Ripley\\" character in Aliens.

0375826726|4.0|Eragon and Saphira have just barely survived the latest battle between the Empire and Varden, and learned the truth about Eragon's parentage. Their encounter with Murtagh and Thorn has made them realize that they desperately need to revisit to their teachers in Ellesmera, but their multitudes of promises keep them from returning. They must help Roran recover Katrina from the Ra'zac, rally forces for the Varden, and find a way to thwart Murtagh. But along the way, they'll discover some dark secrets and learn the sickening methods behind their adversaries' strengths.    Brisingr is a well executed follow up to Eragon and Eldest. It moves at a brisk and almost business like pace, only dragging slightly near the center of the book, as Eragon and Saphira struggle to fulfill their promises. Readers will be glad to see that the duo, Eragon especially, has not been placed upon a lofty pedestal, and still admit ignorance at times, an element that adds just the right touch of plausibility to the book.    Paolini's descriptive writing is becoming easily recognizable, and his ability to draw similes and metaphors between the most unlikely objects only adds to his appeal, and contrary to what one might expect, will draw in reluctant readers. Like with the prequels, the author cleverly manages to sneak in colorful myths and historical stories into the book that only add the reality and vividness of Alagaesia, and make for a more engaging read.    The plot of Brisingr is a little less developed than its prequels, and seems to serve more as a segue between the first two books and the conclusion of the lively series, although the revelation of certain secrets and the suspense and tension Paolini weaves into the pages will go a ways in making Brisingr a quick read. Seasoned Paolini fans will enjoy Brisingr, and be eager to move on to the final book.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is simply the best movie ever made, containing all the elements a perfect movie should, even considering that every person has a right to his/her opinion. The soundtrack is amazing, the scenes are ingenious and the story is simply excellent! This is a story about a Scotsman named William Wallace (Mel Gibson) and his fight for the freedom of the Scottish people, from the oppression of the English ruler-ship. After seeing the death of his wife at the hands of an English nobleman, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) sets out on a quest for vengeance that quickly turns into a crusade for freedom for the entire \\"country\\". The extreme violence as well as the human compassion in this movie are overwhelming in its brilliancy.
0765316897|5.0|I have found that some writers are very good at starting a series but they finish lackluster.  This is not the case with Mistborn 3.

This is a fantastic series and a wonderful ending I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good read.
B001GATF7M|5.0|Twilight Zone anyone?  I have always thought that Carnival of Souls has had a Twilight Zone feel, or maybe they were just trying to make a buck off the cult following it had generated.  At any rate, this Cult Classic, made on a shoestring budget, is sure to please any fan of the Horror Genre.  I recommend watching this movie at night with the lights off, the ominous effect will stay with you for days.      Two cars are drag racing through the countryside when suddenly the car carrying three young women careens off a bridge and into the water below.  Three hours later, one woman emerges from the water...What happens next, and what she sees will scare the pants off you.

B00003OO3O|5.0|Alright, I'm convinced UFO is the perfect hard rock band- you have a lead singer who sings emotionally during the quiet parts, and aggressively when it's time to rock (with an incredible vocal range to make the enjoyment factor even HIGHER) and you have a guitarist who plays melodic, interesting, and exciting guitar solos and riffs.  Even more amazing is some rather spectacular songwriting combined with *just* the right amount of rock and roll, and you have yourself a winner.    Force It is just great from beginning to end.  \\"Let it Roll\\" might remind some of old school Judas Priest, and that would be a nice comparison.  The speedy vocals in this song just EXCITE and AMAZE!  \\"Let it roll, let it roll... LET IT ROLL!\\"      \\"High Flyer\\" has some beautiful, honest, and emotional lyrics, and a melody and guitar solo to leave you completely shocked.  The first time UFO ever attempted to make you cry THIS hard.   I love it!!!!    \\"Shoot Shoot\\" is a glam rock masterpiece, similar to Alice Cooper's \\"Department of Youth\\".  \\"Love Lost Love\\" is a fast-paced song with more great vocals and lyrics.  A great guitar line in the beginning too.  \\"Out in the Streets\\" and \\"Mother Mary\\" just continue to amaze me with the great vocals.  Just highly memorable rock songs.  \\"Dance Your Life Away\\" is fantastic and my favorite part is when the singer sings the line \\"California always seems to have the sun\\".  A very hazey, and yet entirely beautiful piece of writing THAT is.      This stuff should NOT be as overlooked as it currently is!  Come on, buy it now!    Oh, and I think Force It does a great job of combining the muddy sound of Phenomenon with some faster and louder songs, which is what we would experience on No Heavy Petting.  Great great stuff.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I've watched it from start to finish \\"twice\\".... LOVE IT! It is so awesome to be able to sit down and see the whole series from start to finish.

The box and containers are just beautiful... worth every penny!!!
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|AC/DC's Black Ice CD is great!  With many newer rock bands releasing CDs that have only 3 or fewer good songs recorded on them, AC/DC has once again shown they can produce a CD with many great songs on it.  My view is that Rock `n Roll Train, War Machine, Smash N Grab, Wheels, She Likes Rock N Roll, Stormy May Day, Money Made, Rock N Roll Dream, and Black Ice are all winners.  The other songs have varying degrees of likeability.  No other band does this... has this many good songs on one CD.  This is amazing, especially considering that the band has been recording songs since 1974 (34 years).  They've outlasted almost every band that has ever recorded music.    While many of the Black Ice songs stay true to AC/DC's style (which is what their fans like), songs like Money Made, Stormy May Day, and Rock N Roll Dream demonstrate the band is still versatile after all these years.      Overall, Black Ice is well worth purchasing.  Should this indeed be their last release, it's one hell of a way for AC/DC to go out!

B0002KVUKM|1.0|This film is a joke, and not a very funny one. From start to finish, this film is a ridiculous excuse to cram as much cg imagery and revamped monsters into one horrifyingly bad film. It ranks up there with Big Trouble in Little China in the \\"So Bad it's good\\" category. But really, its mostly just freaking terrible.  Indiana Jones, James Bond, Blade, everything in this movie was stolen from a better movie.
B0011Z3DAC|1.0|Give me back the old Linkin Park!! There are numerous problems on this disc. 1. A while back Chetser said \\"vulgarity doesn't ever add anything special\\", ...suuure... 2. There's practically no rapping on this cd.(except Hands Held High and Bleed It Out)  3. Ballads are OK, but over half the songs are all ballads. These guys used to an amazingly aggressive Rap/Rock band, now they're a wimpy Pop/Rock group. AVOID THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|This movie has 3 major problems:<br /><br />1 - It takes entirely too long for the monster thing to attack, up to that point it's a How To guide for anyone who wants to write a pathetically boring Relationship struggle movie.<br /><br />2 - Once the truly interesting part of the film begins, it all ends far to quickly. And Even though the Idea of keeping the Monster largely off camera is pretty compelling, a lot of the shaking camera stuff failed to enthrall me as much as give me a migraine.<br /><br />3 - I guess I'm not allowed to share spoilers, so let me just say, the plot (besides the \\"Giant Monster in Manhattan\\" bit) is just awful and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />However, visuals, audio, and the rest were overall entertaining. This is not a bad movie, but check your brain at the door.
1416594884|4.0|This is the 3rd Le Carre book I've read, and so far, I've not been engaged by any of them.  The writing is great, the characters interesting, the plot moves along swiftly...yet, everytime I read a LeCarre book, I'm disappointed.  There seems to be an emotional distance between the writer and the book, which leads to a greater distance between the reader and the book.  I never forget I'm reading, I'm never transported, I never find myself just enjoying myself.  It reads as important writing, which it is, but I read two newspapers a day, and frankly, I feel my \\"important writing\\" is well covered.
B0012Q732O|1.0|Horrible. Just Horrible. \\"Historical Accuracy be D@mned!\\" must have been the cry of the people who produced this Idiotic movie that I was unable to sit through. I got to the scene with the big Velociraptor/Ostrich things and that was it for me. Not to mention that Horses were not domesticated for thousands of years after the movie was meant to take place. If you want a mindless popcorn movie with some impressive special effects, knock yourself out. If you want to see a good movie about prehistoric man, check out Quest for fire.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|This movie was an excellent continuation to the trilogy,  and I don't understand what people are crying about. The plot was good, the characters were fun, and the adventure was exciting. It may not have been as good as the first three, but it was still pretty dang good. And I'm sure there wasn't anyone who sat bored through the movie, so at least give it some credit. I think any Indy fan should watch it, if only for a follow up to \\"whatever happened to Indiana Jones?\\"
B000K15VSA|5.0|Blade Runner is a wonderful movie that explores issues and possibilities that are more and more relevant every day, and some that we'd just rather not discuss. Visually, it is very appealing and tremendously atmospheric.    I originally saw it at a midnight showing in a theater and loved it. I had been very disappointed that the DVD releases were all \\"director cut\\" types and they removed the original narration by Ford throughout. This set has everything and it is a pleasure to watch each version. Of course, the original is still my favorite. I highly recommend this set :)

Awesome movie, great action, it doesn't look fake or computer-generated, and Iron Man is HOT. The story line is great, the visual effects are outstanding, and the suit is superb. Great movie, and it didn't need crazy sex scenes to make it awesome.

0783225482|5.0|I remember seeing it when it first came out... I was 10. The movie scared the crap out of me! Now I see how funny it is and it sends a clear message about vanity. The actresses play their parts well and Bruce Willis' character is so annoyingly pathetic! I love this movie and I'm so glad I finally bought it.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I would rank this their 3rd best behind Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream. Is it a close 3rd? Probably not. However, those albums are classics so to expect Zeitgeist to match up is just pointless.<br />What I like about this is its back to basics approach. This is a refreshing change from Adore (boring) and Machina (some good songs but overall bloated). It was nice to Corgan & Co. just go out and rock.<br />Some negative points: The last 2 songs were throw aways. Also, a few of the songs (ex. 7 shades of grey) sound like 1st drafts.<br />Overall, a rocking album that sounds like the Pumpkins are back on track.<br /><br />PS To those who say this is not the real pumpkins, I would offer this: If you base the real band solely on having all of the original members, then most, if not all bands would not be the real bands. Example, Metallica and Tool. Besides, Corgan wrote most if not all of the music and Chamberlain wrote the drum parts.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|Not sure what to think here. I've been anxiously awaiting the new Keane album since I saw them in Seattle last year. I've got the first two albums and a bootleg of some other stuff as well. I played the Hell outta those albums.    However, when I heard the first single off of this on Myspace, I didn't like it. Not just \\"I don't like it from Keane\\" but \\"I didn't like it\\". I hoped that the rest of the new album wasn't the same kind of stuff.    First, I'm an older guy, 45, and so, maybe this album's not aimed at me. Hell, hope it's not. But the other Keane albums were really great albums where the lyrics went hand in hand with the music.     This new album just comes off as too light. I didn't dig the drum machine's from the 80s and I certainly don't dig them here. I don't mind drum machines, but the ones in the 80s were terrible. Some of this sounds like Phil Collins or something (by the way, why did a great drummer use so many crummy drum machines for his solo work??).    Granted, I have only listened to the samples. Maybe the album's a grower, but after the first two albums, I was really expecting the band to evolve, but differently than they have here. I'm not into a \\"poppy\\" Keane. Maybe it'll grow on me. I hope so, as I like the band and think their singer's got one of THE purest voices ever. But with these tunes, I'm just not getting the emotion that I did from the others.     By the way, I'm usually a person that LOVES bands' newer stuff. I like to watch them grow, but this is just not something I'd pick up.

1401300529|2.0|Being a little familiar with the topic, I decided to give this rather thick book a quick \\"test run\\".  Being a lot more familiar with the Turkish Brigade history in the Korean War, I looked for it in the lengthy index.  There was no entry on the Brigade, Turkey or Turks at all. Sure the book is about Americans, but Turkey was the first country to answer UN's call right after US, and suffered one of the highest rate and total casualties.  Also the Brigade was closely attached to an American division.  In disbelief I turned the pages to Kunuri battles, and sure enough, buried in a mountain of other details, they were there.  There was a very brief and superfluous description of them but little else or any background.  Secondly, there was this unflattering description of their action at Kunuri, where upon taking one look at the approaching Chinese forces they supposedly realized that they were out of their depth and pulled away.  In reality, the massive Chinese assault had caught all UN forces by surprise.  Whole ROK army to their right simply disintegrated in the face of the brutal Chinese assault and exposed them to a force that was many times their number.  They began to pull back fighting through the gauntlet while unknown to them 8th was already falling back, leaving them behind everybody.  Their costly rearguard action delayed the Chinese by a few days and saved countless American lives as told by many there already.  Their casualties in those few days in the coldest November was over a third of their total loss throughout the whole war.  They are the first foreign military unit to be awarded a US congressional medal.  None of this was placed in proper context.  At that point I decided that it was not worth committing to over 600 pages of ink.
0380725398|5.0|\\"Roads? Who spoke of roads? We go by the moor and the hills, and tread granite and heather as the Druids did before us.\\" Why I have waited so many years to read more of Du Maurier's books I'll never know, but there are definitely more of hers in my immediate reading future!<br /><br />It's early 19C in Southern Cornwall and Mary Yellen's dying mother asks her to sell the family farm and join her Aunt Patience and her husband at Jamaica Inn in Northern Cornwall. Mary arrives and finds that no respectable person will venture near the inn, nor will the carriages stop there for respite. Her once lively and personable aunt is now a terrified shell of a woman married to drunkard inn owner Joss Merlyn. When Joss prepares to entertain \\"guests\\" Mary and her aunt are instructed to stay in their rooms and keep their eyes and ears covered -- although our spunky heroine does peek out the window and sees mysterious comings and goings and Mary suspects smuggling.<br /><br />Mary also becomes friends with her uncle's younger brother Jem, a ne'er do well horse thief (among other things) and the mysterious albino minister Francis Davey. A mischance on the road on the way home from the village on Christmas Eve puts Mary in the middle of her Uncle and his nefarious companions in the midst of a more gruesome crime than smuggling, thus setting in motion a terrifying set of circumstances building up to a nail biting finish on the Bodmin moors.<br /><br />While this one got off to a bit of a slow start for me, by the last 50 or so pages I was on the edge of my seat as Du Maurier gradually built up the tension and mystery for a rocking good finish, and a big surprise twist at the end. I really enjoyed the way the author used the spookiness of the moors and the surrounding terrain of Cornwall to set her scenes and it greatly enhanced the feel of the book in general. 4.5/5 stars.
0385340990|4.0|I love this period piece, the locations really came alive with the powerful descriptions.  It was like watching a movie located in London right after the war.  The authors' dry wit was also quite impressive, making the format of the book work so well (the entire book is comprised of letters written from/to Juliet and other characters).  This is a rare book that combined humor, romance, and the horrors and sadness of war/inhumane treatment of people.  Have your handkerchief or tissues ready.  I couldn't put the book down as I needed to know what happened to all of the characters and the mysteries on the island.
0061478784|5.0|In the land of Ingary, it is considered a great misfortune to be born the eldest of three. It means that you are destined to fail, no matter what you do, and Sophie Hatter, a meek little hat shop owner's daughter, firmly believes in this. She herself is the oldest of three in the town of Market Chipping, and her younger sisters are considered far more pretty and talented than she. But Sophie's miserable little world is turned upside down when she is transformed into an old hag by a woman known as the Witch of the Waste, and she leaves the hat shop to seek her fortune in the world. On the way, Sophie encounters a vicious dog stuck in a hedge, a scarecrow she accidentally brings to life, and most importantly, a huge moving castle owned by a wizard named Howl, who has many different rumors floating around the place about him. In the castle, she discovers a fire demon named Calcifer, who is bound to Howl by a contract he cannot tell Sophie about. Calcifer offers to free Sophie from her curse though, and return her to her normal form, if she breaks the contract between him and Howl. Sophie starts to get used to her life in the castle, including Howl's hopeless apprentice Micheal, the odd business the castle runs, and Howl himself and his peculiar little quirks. But the more times goes on, and the more Sophie grows to almost enjoy her time here, she starts to worry...will she ever be able to free Calcifer, and therefore, herself? And more importantly...does she even want to?<br />I found this book absolutely amazing, and I think it is honestly one of the best books I ever read. It definitely kept my attention throughout the whole novel, and I absolutely could not put it down after I started reading it. I believe that anyone who likes fantasy with a more humorous twist should definitely pick this one up.<br /><br />  -Jenn
B0001LJC2K|5.0|It's like Jeff Buckley and Radiohead had a melodic tryst and created MUSE!  The love child of two of my favorite groups!  The words are smooth and hypnotic and the music is pulsing, swirling slowly from under the vocals up into a fast, hard, beat that ends up dominating the forefront of the song. It's fabulous and sexy!
0142407380|5.0|If you ever read an Alex Rider book you will love this one. Ark Angel by Anthony Horowitz is just plain amazing with the troubles that Alex Rider always gets into, it will keep you on your toes all the way through the book. When I read Ark Angel I could not put it down it draws you right into the action. It all starts out in the hospital from Alexs last wound. Then Alex meets Mr. Drevin which he is part of a project called Ark Angel. But after he meets him everything goes down hill from there. If you want to find out more you will have to read the book. Trust me you wont regret reading this book, it was the best book I ever read. I highly recommend this book because it is ful of action in every page. Also the whole story plot it just perfect for an Alex Rider book. I personally think of this book as a guy book just because it is packed ful of action. over all I thought the book was out standing with the amazing plot and action on every page you wont regret reading this book.
0316172324|1.0|This book was, by far, the most redundant thing I have ever read.

I am very disappointed that I spent money on this item. Too bad my \\"thin slicing\\" is apparently terrible and could not help me on this purchase.
B001DHXT20|4.0|We enjoyed this DVD, the fourth superhero movie we've watched this summer -- Iron Man, Hellboy II, and The Dark Knight being the others. We liked all of the movies but the Incredible Hulk was the only one we didn't get to see in the theater.<br /><br />This version was a much better action film than the last Hulk movie, which we thought played more like a Sci-Fi soap opera. There's plenty of action, although not quite as much as in the Bourne films and the latest 007 film. This movie benefits from a better cast. Edward Norton's portrayal of tortured soul Bruce Banner plays well against the ruthless team of General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Special Forces Officer Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).<br /><br />Again, parents shouldn't share this with young children. The movie is rated PG-13 because of the violence and language. I wish there was a good, animated Hulk movie to recommend but there isn't one available now. Also, please avoid the new Avengers animated DVDs. I made the mistake of picking these up without checking the ratings -- they feature the Hulk, but the stories and the language are not for young children either.<br /><br />If you're looking for better choices for your little superhero fan, check out my Amazon Listmania List, \\"Batman / Dark Knight entertainment for little boys\\" and have fun!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This has got to go down as a classic.  I had never seen the firefly series, but of course went out and purchased it immediately following the viewing of this spectacularly wonderful movie.<br /><br />The Mandarin language mixed with gun slinging astronauts is just brilliant.  The characters are well written and portrayed.<br /><br />Hooray to Joss Whedon for another success!!!  I love the Angel series!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|All the classic Disney animated friends are present, along with the great songs that everyone has come to love.  I also saw this show on Broadway recently and I fell in love with the charaters all over again.  I had to own the movie/Platinum Edition DVD following seeing the show.  One of my favorites.  The bonus disc is great fun too !
B000002VC3|3.0|After watching my favorite groups go on extended hiatus, streamline their approach, or simply pack it in over a period of four years or so, 1982 was a pretty bleak year for this fan of the classic progressive/experimental rock style.  Eye in the Sky (1982) did not offer much consolation either; as I recall, I was somewhat disappointed with the album and even more so with Ammonia Avenue (1984). Indeed, I stopped buying new Alan Parson Projects (APP) albums after Ammonia Avenue.<br /><br />This album of British symphonic pop is more or less divided between some pretty interesting material on the first half (Tracks 1-5) and a batch of comparatively weaker tunes that comprise the second half (generic-sounding and uninspired pop tunes [Tracks 6, 7, and 9], and a tepid instrumental [Track 8]).  The material on the first half is really very strong though, and neatly sums up the dreamy atmospherics and symphonic fullness (an orchestra is used here and there) that characterized the classic APP sound.  In contrast, I did not enjoy Tracks 6-9 for various reasons ranging from the silly (I do not like Lenny Zakatek's voice) to the dislike of the pop arrangements and instrumentation.  However, I did enjoy the delicate closing track Old and Wise (Track 10), which is nicely sung by Colin Blunstone.<br /><br />Although this album has not been remastered, the sound quality is just fine (Alan Parsons was at the helm) and the liner notes include both the lyrics and personnel listing.<br /><br />All in all, while the musicians on the album did not change; a few of whom played on the less than satisfying Single Factor album (Camel, 1982), the times certainly had and I think the album suffered because of it.  While I can not recommend Eye in the Sky without at least some hesitation, it is worth it for the strong material on the first half along with Old and Wise - albeit at a used copy price.  Other albums by APP that I personally found enjoyable include Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976), I, Robot (1977), and Turn of a Friendly Card (1980).1976), I, Robot (1977), and Turn of a Friendly Card (1980).
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|It's a good album, folks.  Mind you, I'm totally easy to please when it comes to AC/DC.  I embrace their all-sound-same style and just look for relatively solid execution.  But Black Ice is probably their best release since Fly on the Wall (which is under rated, IMHO).  Let me expound.  The production on Black Ice is everything a hard rock record should have.  Every instrument sounds through the mix clearly.  The snare sounds awesome.  The guitars sound awesome, which power amp distortion that gets gritty when they push it, but cleans up when they play lightly.  Seriously, it has less \\"distortion\\" than pretty much any album in the Brian Johnson era but still sounds heavy.  The mix is NOT brick wall limited at all, and you can hear/feel the dynamics in the guitar playing so that when they back off, your ears get the break they need just like a live performance.  Also, they showed enough restraint in the low end EQ that even when I crank my stock car stereo up the bass doesn't flub out.  And after listening to ten songs cranked way up, my ears aren't worn out by loudness-wars pummel like on so many records today.  It's probably mixed \\"loud\\" relative to '70's records, but shows a lot more dynamics than nearly any heavy music coming out nowadays.    And Brian Johnson sounds really good!  Really good.  Probably the best since Flick of the Switch, once again.  I don't know what physical work he's done on his voice, but he's lost the about-to-die strain I could hear on Stiff Upper Lip.  They keep him in the middle of the mix rather than out front, but that works well.  He's not buried in the mix like on Fly on the Wall.    Angus plays slide on one tune, which I first thought would be gimmicky when I read about it, but really works great.  Sounds awesome.  Williams and Rudd sound great, per usual, with Williams bass given a slightly more prominent role.  He plays eighth note pumps on virtually every tune, over Rudd's straigh on 4/4 beats.  The rhythms are very much allsoundsame, however, if you're looking for something to criticize.  The beats, tempos, and that eigth note bass line are pretty predictable.  But it's AC/DC after all.    There really aren't any filler tunes on the album either.  Every song rocks really well.  And unlike their last five albums or so, Johnson's voice doesn't grate on me after listening to five or six songs straight through.  Every song is about a seven, eight or nine on a ten scale.  On the flip side, I'm not sure which song is a ten on a ten scale, making the choice of radio single less than obvious.  But, again, all the songs are at least a seven, so there's no point in the album where the energy gets sucked out.  The band is incredibly tight.  I know it's a studio album so maybe that's a \\"duh\\" statement.  But they play together so tightly throughout, which is part of their signature sound.  It also makes their sound really predictable, along with the predictable rhythms as mentioned above.    Lyrically, there's not much going on here.  Most of the sexual innuendo of their '70's and '80's albums is gone now, which is probably a good thing after tunes like \\"Cover You in Oil\\" and \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" made it seem to me that they were trying too damned hard (no pun).  The songs are mostly about rocking or about being loud or whatever.  Often it's \\"Whatever\\" as I'm not sure I could pass a content test about the lyrical content at this point.  The Young brothers wrote the lyrics again, as they have done the past several albums.  I will say that they haven't written any really stupid lyrics on Black Ice, which is a nice change from the last few albums which all had a couple songs that made you think \\"WTF?\\" about the lyrics.    In summary, there's no new ground broken here, which won't surprise anyone.  But the production is absolutely awesome, Johnson sounds better than he has a right to, and the band is playing tight as a drum.  I may be a dinosaur, but AC/DC still has a unique sound to me that I'm not getting from a lot of new groups.  In fact, with so many bands like The Sword copying Black Sabbath so faithfully, I wonder why there aren't more bands stealing from the AC/DC formula.  You have Buck Cherry and a couple others, but still no band sounds like AC/DC.  I expected this album to sound like Stiff Upper Lip, which was ok but not great.  But Black Ice sounds way better than Stiff Upper Lip.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|Coming of North by Northwest was a massive high for Alfred Hitchcock his next project was always going to be difficult in matching North by Northwest's brillance, it is with great joy that Hitchcock made Psycho, based on the novel by Robert Bloch.    One of the greatest Suspense Horror films ever made it is of a simple story of 2 geners's coming together to create a frightening shocking experience, plot is of a young woman called Marion Crane played by Janet Leigh wants to get away with her boyfriend so when Marion is at work and her boss comes in with $40,000.00 Marion steals it and takes off.  She takes her car to a local garage one morning and exchanges it for a new car under the nose of a suspecting Police officer, Marion uses some of the stolen cash to purchase it, she pays the owner of the garage who seems to notice that something is wrong she then takes of in a hurry    With heavy rain pouring down on her as she drives Marion needs to stop for the night and sees a sign of a motel called BATES MOTEL, from the welcoming Vacancy light there is rooms available she sees that there is someone by the Motel and stops for the night!.    Played brillantly by the late great Anthony Perkins Norman Bates is probably one of the scariest characters in movie history he is cool , friendly and kind to start with but what Marion Crane does not realise is that Norman Bates is a monster who has killed his mother and thinks that she is still alive  in him anyway, a scary monster in the form of Man which equals Hannibal Lecters monster played by Anthony Hopkins.    What the viewer does not realise is that they are not watching a crime movie but are watching a horror movie after Marion stops of at Bates Motel, then the Suspense and shocks kick in as Marion gets to know Norman Bates.    Adapted from the book of the same name by scriptwriter Joseph Stefano amd with a haunting musical score by Bernstein, great acting performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, Alfred Hitchcock made one of the most scariest, shocking, and suspensefull film of all time, simply put in words this film is a masterpiece truly a great entertaining scary experience equal to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead, John Carpenter's Hallowee etc etc    The DVD  There have been a couple of DVD versions available here in the UK, but after buying this new 2 Disc Special Edition from the USA, I think that it is the best version for some time.  On Disc one you have the Main Feature with Commentary with Alfred Hitchcock Author Stephen Rebello  The Shower Scene  The Shower Scene Storyboards  The Psycho Archives  Production Notes  Production Photographs  Lobby cards- Psycho Poster Ads  Disc Two  On this second Disc you will find the meat of the package with a 94 minute Documentary called the making of Psycho, this feature explains how every aspect of the film was dealt with and brought to the screen.  Next is In the Shadows- Hitchcock Legacy which runs at 25 mins, present directors such as John Carpenter, William Friedkin, and Eli Roth discuss there influencefs rom Hitchcock.  Last is a episode of Alfred Hitchcock presents \\" lamb in the Slaughter\\".    Picture and Sound  As the cover of the DVD says Digitally Remastered after watching the film i can say that it is, very sharp Black and White transfer is displayed on screen, Audio is very good as well with Dolby Digital Mono 2.0  sounds roar from the TV especially the Score.    Overall  Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the greatest Suspense Horror movies of all time, great story, characters, acting Hitchcock's direction is flawless, as near a perfect movie as there will ever be.  The 2 Disc Special Edition set is also brillant, the set is packed with a lot of revealing extras abot the film, writer and Director, with Digitally Remastered Picture and Sound Universal Legacy Series has done a fine job with this DVD.

1931788340|5.0|From all the photography books in Barnes & Noble this is the book that attracted my attention and I bought it the second time I saw it.  A good picture is going to stay in you memory for ever and the pictures inside are of this kind.
1596434252|5.0|ISBN 1596434252 - When I first looked at this book, it was marked with a \\"Reading Level\\" of 9-12.  It is now marked \\"Baby-Preschool\\".  I think both are wrong, for different reasons and think the right age group is more like 3-100.<br /><br />Yes, there really are just 26 letters in the entire book (discounting the copyright page in back).  And, yes, you can see the entire book - every last letter - in the video on the Amazon listing.  But even that, a full preview, hardly does the book justice.  Until you've held it in your hands and opened each page a few times, you'll never really \\"get it\\".<br /><br />While there are a million pop-up books out there, I've never seen any other quite like this one.  Each letter comes into view in a unique way, so that you can never really be prepared for what's on the next page.<br /><br />Whether you're buying it as a gift or not, the protective sheets that are inside should be removed and the pages carefully opened, to loosen them a little, before you sit down to enjoy it or box it up to wrap; some of the \\"pop\\" in the pop-ups is a little tight at first.  Very young children will probably do a bit of damage to the book, so I'd keep it away from them when they're alone.  Older children and adults will find the mechanics of some of the pop-ups fascinating, turning even grown men into ooo-ing and aah-ing kids.  Learning, teaching, and reading the alphabet has never, ever, been this attractive before!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks
B001CZJKS0|2.0|I'm into everything having to do with Halloween.  But there's no way I'd pay this much (fiddy bucks) for this \\"Package\\".
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I can't say enough about this mini-series. It was a five star on every level. It was totally entertaining and it always kept us pulled into the story. The acting was incredible and raw. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney gave amazing performances.<br /><br />It was fascinating from a historical perspective. I learned so much, and I was so absolutely inspired by the story of John Adams and his family. This series showed the power of conviction John Adams had, but it also showed his imperfections of those of others. I also learned a lot about how they lived back then. It was so interesting!<br /><br />The relationship between John Adams and his wife was explored in depth. As amazing as he was, his wife was also incredible. Laura Linney did an outstanding job portraying her. The sets and costumes were well done. The script was engaging and moving. I have to say that each week this series kept us wanting more. Honestly I'm a guy who generally doesn't like period movies, but this really appealed to me anyway.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in American history or politics, and to anyone who likes a good drama. Really I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B000HT386M|4.0|This movie will make you laugh, and it will also make you cry. This is definately one of Adam's best performances, plus I never expect to cry at an Adam Sandler movie lol<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|I have never written a review for anything before but this album is so good that I felt compelled to do so. I cannot stop listening to this CD.  While I love just about everything on it, there are a few tracks that stand out for me:  1. Devour - An intense hard rocker inspired by the band's visit to the troops in Iraq. This one is like an angry punch in the gut...Wow!  2. Sound of Madness - Simply a great title track. You can't help but tap your foot or pound your fists to this song.  3. The Crow and the Butterfly - This one is my favorite. I love the beautiful arrangement on this.  4. If You Only Knew - Very catchy, upbeat love song. Brent's voice sounds amazing (as always).  5. Breaking Inside - Lots of emotion. I hope they release this one as a single.    The three bonus tracks are really good too. I especially like, I Own You. This is Shinedown's best effort so far. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good, solid rock music.    Note: If you like this, check out both releases from the band Alter Bridge.
0553296981|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest books ever written. As a reader reads this book, he will see a young girl blossoming into a phenomenal young woman. All in the confines of her family's \\"Secret Annexe\\", while in hiding from the Gestapo, and to keep from being captured, and sent to a concentration camp.<br /><br />As I read this book, I felt Anne Frank was speaking to me. I felt her anger, her rebellion, and laughed when she would tell a joke, or say something harsh about another member of the \\"Secret Annexe\\". Her words, so eloquently written, will touch anybody who reads them, and this book will become one that they will never forget, as it has with me. As I read her diary, and connected with Anne, I felt a depressing feeling, because I knew that at one point her diary entries would suddenly stop, and there would be no fitting ending for this masterpiece.<br /><br />With that said, what Anne Frank has left for us is a memorable diary, which encompasses what she went through. The hunger, and horrible conditions that she, and many Jews were put through is a testament to how cruel, intolerant, and unjustifiably evil humanity can be.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read, and even to those who don't.
B001AX9DT0|4.0|I have been a fan of Ray for 5 years and have seen him live several times.  Gossip in the Grain is a terrific progression and contains stunning future classics such as I Still Care For You.  On the other hand, Ray has performed Hey Me, Hey Mamma live in recent years and that version is far superior to the ghastly banjo led version here. It does not even sound like him on Hey Me, even though it is as his power and depth are missing.  Secondly the Meg White song is plain daft.  Ray has so many other songs in his arsenal such as \\"You Should Belong To Me\\" and \\"I Won't Be Around\\" that had they been included this would have been an all time classic album.  Maybe on the next cd?

Besides, how could you beat the $34 price tag with free two day shipping (I have amazon prime). If you have both an HD DVD player and a Blu-ray player like me, it makes no sense to get the more expensive blu-ray version when you can have the exact same thing for half the price. Anyone who tells you that one is better than the other is wrong and doesn't know what their talking about! If you are a fan of the Matrix, this is a MUST buy!
B000001EGE|4.0|By the time Elton release \\"Honky Chateau\\" in 1972 he and co songwriter Bernie Taupin had several albums under their belts and had become a cohesive team.  This album would go straight to the top of the charts with its huge hit singles \\"Honkey Cat\\", \\"Rocket Man\\", and the AOR favorite \\"Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters\\".  Elton tried a little bit of everything on this album and for the most part it all worked.  This would also be the first album to feature the backing band of Olsen, Murray, and Johnstone who would stay with Elton off and on through the rest of his career.  Violist Jon Luc Ponty also is on hand prior to the launching of his own instrumental solo career.  This album is somewhat inconsistent and leaned towards a generally more commercial sound.  Songs like \\"Mellow\\", \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\", and \\"Slave\\" only half work, but overall this is a good Elton John record and his first of many to go to number one on the charts.
0307383415|5.0|It isn't often that one finds a celebrity figure who is honest enough to not only admit their flaws, but draw attention to them. In Barack Obama's memoir, he does just that. Regardless of his portrayal in the media and his appeal as a politician, Obama wrote a story that tells of his tribulations growing up, and what he learned along the way.    His story is wrapped around his search for his father's true identity. Growing up Obama gained little influence from his father and only dreamed of what the man truly was. Even in school he spun yarns about his father's life in Africa: \\"My Grandfather, see, he's a chief. It's sort of like the king of the tribe... So that makes my father a prince. He'll take over when my grandfather dies\\" (63). Behind his mythical tales, Obama dreams of the real life behind his father's mysterious exterior, hoping to one day discover a man of true wonder behind the stories.   Before Barack can find anything out, though, his father dies in a car accident. Obama is sent reeling, and begins a journey throughout the rest of the story to find how he relates to his unknown father's identity. However, he struggles to undertake this task until he begins to delve into his own identity, a difficult task for a young, stubborn Barack.    Throughout his early years Barack is faced with a number of outside changes that shift his identity. He lives in Hawaii, Indonesia, New York and Chicago, searching for something that provides meaning to him. One of Barack's first breakthroughs is in finding his desire to help others. He begins work in Chicago as a community organizer, his platform from which he goes on to do great things. It is his toil along the way, though, that shapes his character. He confronts numerous obstacles on his way to gaining influence. In one instance, when speaking with a Chicago public school principle, he asks for any suggestions. Her response suggests the scale of the task Obama takes on: \\"Short of tearing this whole place down and giving people a chance to start over, I'm not sure\\" (232). This exemplifies the trouble with Barack's situation, knowing that he cannot easily solve problems such as poverty and race issues. Obama grapples with his character, at times striving to take on the world, at others not sure where to begin. This personal battle is what makes the story behind his strife fascinating, as the reader watches him grow, while searching for the man who fuels his courage.

B001E1DJD4|5.0|It's been four long years since Rachael Yamagata's debut album \\"Happenstance\\" made its appearance, and since then we've not heard a sung word.<br /><br />So that makes the appearance of \\"Elephants... Teeth Sinking Into Heart\\" even sweeter, especially since Yamagata has clearly not stagnated at the point where she became successful (as most singer/songwriters do). Her second full-length album is just as bluesy and quietly bittersweet as her prior work, but four years have added polish and depth to her music -- especially the layered, string-soaked instrumentals and hauntingly world-weary lyrics.<br /><br />\\"If the elephants have past lives, yet are destined to always remember/it's no wonder how they scream,\\" Yamagata muses over a delicate piano melody. As a backdrop of strings pass behind her, she meditates on a past lover who is \\"forcing me to remember when all I want is to just forget you,\\" and compares the painful memories and lingering feelings to various animals -- elephants, tigers, hawks.<br /><br />As the song ends, she warns listeners sadly, \\"So for those of you falling in love/keep it kind, keep it good, keep it right/Throw yourself in the midst of danger, but keep one eye open at night....\\"<br /><br />Things get no more cheerful in the songs that follow -- the reigning sound is that of piano/string ballads, drifting sadly through tales of lost love and haunting regrets. Yamagata does give the sound some variation -- gentle thumping ballads asking \\"what if I leave?\\", soaring laments, string-soaked jazzy tunes, trickling instrumentals that echo the first song, a folksy \\"Duet\\" with Ray Lamontaigne, country-edged melodies. It ends with a suitably plaintive lament (\\"Someday I hope I can find the horizon/I've been all around the world... And if I did teach you anything at all/I hope that you learned how to love...\\") that drips with painful sentiment...<br /><br />.... except it's not actually the end. There's a second disc on here called \\"Teeth Sinking Into Heart,\\" which is less into the whole piano-jazz/pop sound and more into rough-edged rock'n'roll. Yamagata smashes through the off-kilter melody of \\"Sidedish Friend,\\" which sounds like the next step from her sadder songs: \\"I don't want you hangin' out with me/But I want you when I call/We can stay together separately/And we won't be lonely at all....\\"<br /><br />She whirls through the celebrity clashes and breakups of \\"Accidents\\" (\\"There's nothing worse than bitterness/just splashed across the page\\") and the blurry, bass-driven \\"Faster.\\" The EP finishes with a sort of balancing act in the multilayered \\"Pause the Tragic Ending\\" and \\"Pause,\\" where the basic pop song expands into bittersweet, epic proportions. So different, yet so beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Elephants... Teeth Sinking Into Heart\\" is a pretty unique musical experience: the first disc takes Yamagata's signature sound and makes it deeper and richer, and the second forges fearlessly into PJ Harvey/Pixies/Tom Waits territory.  It would have been a disaster if she had broken up the bittersweet expanse of \\"Elephants\\" with the rock'n'roll sound of those later songs, but as a full-length album and accompanying EP it works perfectly.  Call it spreading her musical wings in two very different directions.<br /><br />Most of these songs are cradled in Yamagata's gentle piano melodies and blanketed in a thick swathe of overhanging, bittersweet strings. These two instruments weave together in a rich expanse of melancholy music that can reach some truly epic climaxes, or fall into a haunting murmur (\\"This little life... goes so fast...\\"). Additionally, Yamagata sprinkles them with a little flute, thumpy drums and some folksy guitar too, only to then switch over to grinding bass, reverberating guitar and breakneck pace in the second disc.<br /><br />Only the last couple songs bridge over the two styles, uniting the rock'n'roll mentality and sharp guitars with the plaintive quality and nimble guitars of her quieter songs. \\"Pausethe Tragic Ending\\" and \\"Don't\\" are the most brilliant that Yamagata has made yet.<br /><br />Her husky voice has lost none of its quality either -- she still sounds world-weary and wise beyond her years, and seemingly perpetually haunted by the ghosts of old love affairs... although she can turn into a raw-voiced rock chick when the song demands. Her songwriting is what has changed -- it's gotten a lot more evocative and mature, with memorable metaphors (\\"A whispering ghost of neighborhood flame\\") and vividly emotional lyrics (\\"If the hawks in the trees need the dead/if you're living you don't stand a chance/You can lie there and say you are fed/but there are only two ends to this dance...\\").<br /><br />It's been four years, but Rachael Yamagata has grown as a songwriter and a musician -- and while \\"Elephants\\" shows a more mature version of her past work, the accompanying \\"Teeth Sinking Into Heart\\" reveals a whole different side.

0307269752|5.0|I'm a big fan of mystery novels and this is one of the best new ones I've read in quite a while.  The mystery in this novel is actually nested inside an adventure involving financial misconduct by a shadowy mogul and his use of false information to destroy the credibility of an investigative financial reporter.<br /><br />The novel was paced well and I enjoyed the bits of Sweden (the setting).  I found the plotting to be excellent, the pace gripping and the characters interesting.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|As the opening credits roll, we're treated to a montage of shots of an experiment gone wrong. Some how, the process turns Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) into a giant green monster, the Hulk.<br /><br />But that was several years ago. (How many, we are never sure.) These days, Bruce is hiding out in Brazil working at a soda bottle company and learning to control his anger.<br /><br />But he can't stay hidden forever, and soon General Ross (William Hurt) gets a bead on his location. He sets up a team to go in and retrieve him, even bring in Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help.<br /><br />When things don't go as planned, Bruce decides it is time to head home and get help. But that means reconnecting with General Ross' daughter Betty (Liv Tyler). Is there a cure for Bruce's condition? Can the two get it?<br /><br />This movie started our fairly slowly, making me glad that so much hit the cutting room floor.  But once Liv Tyler's Betty is introduced, things really pick up.  Not necessarily the action, but the drama.  Betty and Bruce's complicated relationship captured me and pulled me into the story.  Those two have some wonderful scenes together.  And the two actors capture the tenderness and chemistry perfectly, which doesn't surprise me at all.  Every time I have seen them, I have been blown away by their performances.  Not that I'm detracting from the rest of the cast, who are fine.  And watch for fun cameos by Stan Lee and TV Hulk, Lou Ferrigno, not to mention in the very last scene.<br /><br />The Hulk was created with a combination of motion capture and computer animation.  Sometimes, that foundation was obvious.  But most of the time you could believe what you were seeing on the screen was real.  And they never took me out of the film, which is important because the climatic battle was very emotional, not just some big fight scene.<br /><br />The original Hulk was just okay, but this one really made me care about the characters.  Despite a slow start, I really enjoyed it.
B000001Y5D|4.0|4 Non Blondes only recorded this one album, which was originally released in 1993. The band scored a big world-wide hit with the excellent \\"What's Up\\", but that songs was not really a good representive of the musical style of the band. Judged from this album their main musical influence comes from bands like Led Zeppelin og maybe even the Yardbirds: in other words solid blues-rock. The band's trademark was lead-vocalist Linda Perry's powerfull vocals and a generally tight sound.<br /><br />Apart from the slightly funky closing track \\"No Place Like Home\\" there is no weak tracks on t he album. \\"Spaceman\\", which was another single taken the album, is the track which comes closest to the style of \\"What's Up\\" - and these two songs are my personal favourites.<br /><br />Among the blues-rockers the opener \\"Train\\", \\"Pleasantly Blue\\" and \\"Old Mr Heffner\\" stand out. The acoustic \\"Drifting\\" is also really good.<br /><br />After the album the band recorded  songs for a few movie-soundtracks, but Perry thought that their musical direction had turned too commercial, so she decided the leave the band, which consequently decided to split-up.

B00008BXJG|4.0|It took me a while to buy this album. Don't get me wrong...I love this band...in fact I consider them to be the best rock band of all time and only behind The Beatles as far as all musical acts are concerned. Why this trepidation? Well, as a kid, I was used to buying an AC/DC album and knowing that there would be a couple of great songs on it and that I would discover some good songs that I hadn't heard before.  With \\"Highway to Hell\\", I only really knew the title track...sure, it's great, but does this album have anything else decent on it? Yes. Here's my pick of the best tracks on this album:    Highway to Hell: THE classic track off of this album. AC/DC is yet to release a fully fledged greatest hits album (\\"Who made who\\" comes closest to this), but the title track is an automatic selection of any hypothetical compilation. AC/DC has rarely come close to the celebration of living life hard and to its fullest as in this song. It's a classic for its grating, typically AC/DC guitar riff/introduction. *N.B. an ANNOYING feature of this song is that the riff is lopsided...if you listen to it on headphones, the audio for the riff is tilted to the right hand speaker. Oddly, when I heard this song on the radio, the 'tilt' was on the left hand side. This suggests to me that the remaster was flawed. One of the GREAT things about AC/DC classics is how you get one guitar crunching out a riff and then getting joined by another guitar on the other speaker. As it stands, the sound on this song is almost as bad as those early, faux stereo songs the Beatles used to churn out (and that's because they really didn't have proper stereo when they started out).  Really, I see this 'tilt' as a mistake which should get fixed. It might be less noticeable if you listen to it on loudspeakers.    There really aren't any other 'classics' on this album, but of the rest, the most solid songs are:    Walk all over you: has a promising intro...moody. This song does seem to have some unintended distortion on the guitar. I like the lead guitar work in this song as well as the backing vocals, which is very good, in AC/DC's signature, laddish way.     Touch to much: I must have heard this song somewhere along the line as I always thought it could be a good song. Probably didn't hear it on the radio, as ONLY the title track seems to get played...at least nowadays, here in Australia. Good stereo stage...must stop whingeing about the lack of this on the title track! Excellent backing vocals too.        The two songs above are the kind of songs that grow you. In other words they might not have the immediate sex appeal of classic AC/DC songs but they are the kind of songs that would be welcome on any compilation by this band.    The last song of particular interest on this album for me is:    Night Prowler: lead singer Bon Scott sounds particularly phlegmy, especially for the intro.  Lead guitar is REALLY soulful in sound here. I like the backing vocals here too, and it's not just the typical echo-ing which the band is so fond of...they get their own lines too. Lyrical construction in this song is good too. It's quite menacing. Apparently it's not meant to be, according to the band, but it is. Think I heard that this song is there version of the Rolling Stones' \\"Midnight rambler\\"...and after just now looking at the lyrics to that song, they are BOTH menacing...so, I don't see how AC/DC can get criticised for a song like this and not the Stones!       Anyway, despite my initial misgivings on this album, I think it is an essential purchase. This is pretty much the first AC/DC album where I've noticed that they actually do have a bass guitar player...it's quite noticeable in songs like \\"Shot down in flames\\" and \\"Love hungry man\\".        For me, AC/DC are the greatest guitar act of all time. There are Malcolm Young's crunching riffs on rhythm guitar, and brother Angus' equally exceptional lead guitar work...whether the songs be rock, rock'n'roll, boogie or whathaveyou. To the uninitiated who claim that this band has only ever released one song, multiple times, this puts the lie to that claim. There is a lot of variety on this album.        The boys' and Bon Scott's lyric writing is also in exceptional form here. In some songs the lyrics are a bit dated...e.g. \\"Night Prowler\\" lightens the tone at the end with Bon referencing American comedian Robin Williams' character \\"Mork\\" from the tv show \\"Mork and Mindy\\". You have to be of a certain age to get that ad-libbery. Bon also has some fun at the end of \\"Shot down in flames\\". The boys don't take themselves too seriously, which is good.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I was a bit underwhelmed by this movie, despite my passionate interest in the stargate universe and my appreciation of the ori storyline.    I thought the Ori were a great evolution of the stargate story, but this concluding chapter was a bit of a let-down.  Many other reviewers commented on the various specifics, but basically if you've seen the rest of the Ori saga in seasons 9 & 10 you'll want to see this movie.  It just isn't as good as it could have been.
B001G5IJVK|4.0|Not that anyone needs yet ANOTHER KISS compilation (or should that be kompilation?), this one actually almost does something that I've been thinking they should have done a long time ago.  Since they don't seem keen on putting out an album of new material, put out a newly recorded CD of under-appreciated old songs instead of just the same old hits.  So they did the \\"newly recorded\\" part with that new Japanese CD, and they got the under-appreciated old songs with this set...now they just need to meld those two ideas.    Ikons pretty much hits the nail on the head with the choices for the lesser known songs on this.  \\"Ladies Room,\\" \\"Charisma,\\" \\"Almost Human,\\" and \\"Larger Than Life\\" would definitely be Gene choices I would consider for my dream compilation.  Something like \\"She's So European\\" with a real rock production instead of the pop of Unmasked could really make that song cool if it were re-recorded.  Getting back to this set, I probably would have chosen either \\"Mr. Make Believe\\" or \\"Man Of 1,000 Faces\\" over \\"Radioactive\\" if I had to choose only one song from his solo album to include.    \\"Mr. Speed,\\" \\"All American Man,\\" \\"Take Me,\\" and \\"Wouldn't You Like To Know Me?\\" are pretty much exactly what I would list as the best Paul Stanley songs nobody knows.  How \\"Wouldn't You Like To Know Me?\\" wasn't a single or at the very least on the Best Of The Solo Albums compilation was alway a mystery to me.  An awesome Paul song that may finally be getting some recognition!    The Ace tunes make sense.  The only ones he sang on a KISS release that weren't included are \\"Torpedo Girl\\" and \\"In Your Face.\\"  I probably would have replaced either \\"Snow Blind\\" or \\"Save Your Love\\" with \\"Torpedo Girl,\\" but I'm fine with \\"In Your Face\\" being left off.  Still would have been nice to have ALL the Ace KISS songs one one disc just for the heck of it.  I'm REALLY happy to see \\"What's On Your Mind?\\" on there.  Definitely the forgotten gem on his solo record, and the one that deserves to be heard.    All of Peter's KISS songs are on here.  The only decision you have to make is what songs from his solo album you put on there to fill out the 14 songs.  \\"I Can't Stop The Rain\\" and \\"Easy Thing\\" are by far the best songs on the record.  After that it's kind of a toss up.  I probably would have chosen \\"You Matter To Me,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Love You,\\" or \\"Hooked On Rock 'N' Roll,\\" but they're all about the same.    All in all I'd say this is a pretty good compilation.  Nothing new for the die hards (although pretty cool packaging), but would be something good for a new fan to get so they could be exposed to some of the best of the deeper cuts.  The guys in my band came in one day knowing how to play \\"Plaster Caster\\" and \\"Two Sides Of The Coin\\"...I'm like, how do you guys know THOSE songs?  Because they had Greatest KISS and liked those songs that the casual fan had never heard that just happened to be on that compilation. So people really do like those songs that at first glance may just seem to be filler material.  You can absolutely tell that real fans had a hand in choosing the songs for this ikonic kompilation.

B000ILZ66Y|5.0|It's a great book to read. I couldn't put it down when I read it. It's highly recommended if your a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan or just a fan of music.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Why do I say that this album is a return to form for the band? Well, as a child I had bought a few of their albums and always found at least two songs that I considered 'classics' as well as 'discovering' other songs on those albums which were good or fun or had some sort of appeal. Those albums would be \\"T.N.T\\" (which I bought new in Australia recently, after hearing that it was no longer being made...having been replaced by the US version of it, \\"High voltage\\", which had minor track variations), \\"Dirty deeds done dirt cheap\\" (I mean the original Australian release, not the US version, which, for some reason, omitted one of their all time great songs, \\"Jailbreak\\". Go figure) and, of course, \\"Back in black\\", which is my pick as the greatest album of all time in the pop/rock field.       After these classic albums, AC/DC seemed to go downhill...releasing albums which you would consider yourself lucky to hear one great song, and unlucky if no song was great. Those kind of albums would include \\"Flick of the switch\\" and \\"Fly on the wall\\". In other words, those albums didn't have a song which you might want to include in any proposed compilation album by the band...or, if you did, you might change your mind years later, thinking that the song didn't have the legs that you thought it did.        So, despite knowing that this album had two songs that I really liked on it, I finally took the plunge years later and bought it...probably due to the discounting of this band's back catalogue at the time. What can I say about it? It has two classic songs on it and is otherwise rock sollid. Really, that's all you need to give an AC/DC album 5 stars, which is what I'm doing.    Here are my picks as the best songs on the album-    The classics-    Thunderstruck: combines the best elements of AC/DC...really cool lead guitar, laddish backing vocals and growling lead singing by Brian Johnson, who seems to be channeling ex lead-singer Bon Scott (who tragically died whilst still inthe band).     Money talks: another classic AC/DC song and sound. Great intro and riff with a great chorus and backing vocals. I'd always mishear the song lyric as \\"Love before the money\\" but it turns out Brian is singing \\"Love me for the money\\". So, this song is about hookers. It's a theme the band returns to in this album...perhaps they sing too much about hookers in this album? The other song to do with hookers on this album is \\"Got you by the balls\\".        There really aren't any bad tracks on this album, but the best of the rest are-    The razors edge: for me, this song breaks the mould, to a certain extent.  It doesn't have the typical AC/DC sound. It's quite moody...adventurously so. Reminded me a bit of, say, Metallica via Black Sabbath, or Aerosmith's song \\"Living on the edge\\".     Are you ready: a good, rowdy pub-rock song with a strong chant by the backing vocalist of the band.    Let's make it: a nice riff from Malcolm on rhythm guitar and good melodic singing by Brian...more melodic than is usual for him.     If you dare: has a noticeable bass guitar (unusual for the band) and the song sounds a little bit like an Aerosmith song, with its boogie riff. The backing vocalists chanting is good too.        Of all the AC/DC albums that I've heard (about half a dozen), this one has the most noticeable bass guitar. In fact, I would have been hard pressed to know that AC/DC actually had a bass guitarist if it wasn't for an album like this.        Like I said, this album doesn't really have any bad songs on it...okay, some people may find \\"Mistress for Christmas\\" not pretty, but then again, others may like its playfulness. It utilises 'jingle bells' as found in Christmas songs.        This album has all the qualities of a five star AC/DC album: at least two great songs and some other songs which are a pleasure to listen to. Essential purchase.    If you like music more towards the heavy metal end of the spectrum, I recommend Coldseed's debut album \\"Completion makes the tragedy\\". I've reviewed that here at this site, as well as a handful of other AC/DC albums which I've given 4 or more stars out of 5 too.
B0017MO10U|5.0|This movie is a perfect bookend to the stargate saga, although of course the future is open for a continuing of the story.    Production values are excellent.  Scenes hinted at in previous episodes regarding a massive invasion of earth by space are finally seen, and they do an excellent job of portraying earth under attack by space.      Virtually every old enemy re-surfaces in the movie due to the altered timeline story, and it is refreshing to see the familiar 'baddie' characters reprising these roles, even if only briefly.      You'll appreciate this movie the most if you see it after watching the main stargate series, obviously.  But the pacing, the interesting story, great special effects, and the excellent performance by Cliff Simon as Baal really make this a wonderful science fiction production in general.      I look forward to future releases and the continuing of the stargate story in this and other media.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Irreversible was disturbing, unquestionably.  It was probably one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.  Two of the more notable scenes had me wanting to look away, something that the the common day torture porn movies can't seem to manage (though I stay away from them as a rule).  Everything in these reviews are right in that regard -- it's not for those with soft stomachs.  However, it's also a powerful film that will stick with you for several days after viewing if you can absorb it all.    Some of the reviews call it exploitive and some call it a revenge film... I'd say it's absolutely neither.  It doesn't use the violence/rape as a tool for satisfaction and it doesn't use it as an excuse for later actions.  In a typical revenge film the initial incident (in this case the rape of Alex) is merely the starting point for the revenge character (in this case Marcus) to go on a wild spree righting the wrongs (the fire extinguisher scene).  However, because we are initially shocked and horrified by the murder with the fire extinguisher, we gain no satisfaction from it, so it's hardly called revenge (knowing it's the wrong man doesn't help either).  When we see the rape scene we know there is no satisfaction in the \\"revenge\\", so it's merely disturbing and doesn't serve as an excuse for Marcus' actions.  It proceeds to a small fight at a party which ends in Alex leaving - gut wrenching, if you didn't have your eyes closed for what the character had to go through 10 minutes earlier.  Then, end with Marcus and Alex happily together in bed pissing away time as two people very comfortable with each other might do.  Ultimately the fact that it ends with calm and caring scenes is all the more depressing... You know their future, while they sit there idly blissful.    This film would have been grossly different had it been in chronological order.  It could easily be called an exploitive revenge flick with extreme violence and odd structure (an unsatisfying ending and with disproportionately happy beginning) - I'd bet chronologically it'd be an NC-17.  While, fundamentally, the order as it stands makes this a film against rape and murder - certainly there was no satisfaction taken from either of them and the direction demanded that the impact be fully felt.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Not sure where this one rates as far as their catalog goes, but to me it's quite a bit better than their last studio release \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\".    The first single \\"Rock And Roll Train\\" may be the best song on here, but there are quite a few in the range of it at least in songs like \\"War Machine\\", \\"Wheels\\", \\"Big Jack\\", and \\"She Likes Rock and Roll\\"...to name just a handful. \\"Skies On Fire\\" near the beginning of the CD is a good one also. The CD starts out real well, and only let's down a bit later in the CD. \\"Smash N Grab\\" and \\"Spoilin' For A Fight\\" are decent too along with \\"Rainy Day May\\" I think it's called. Not much to skip over if you are a big fan of the band and needed a fix of rock and roll after all those years of no new material from them.       The song \\"Anything Goes\\" perplexes me a bit, It sounds a bit like a cross between Bruce Springsteen and Creedence Clearwater Revival perhaps? It's an okay song, but it sounds like a cover song or something. At least you can't say \\"all their songs sound the same\\" in that regard now.    There's alot here to like, and the CD never really get's boring to me, it's AC/DC and you know what to expect really and they definitly have delivered on this new release. It's no \\"Back In Black\\" or \\"Highway To Hell\\", but the lack of huge songs in favor of a good quantity of quality songs makes up for that fact, and the fact that they can put out such a good group of songs at this stage and their age is a plus. Like em or not, they are legends.        Great group of songs from one of the most influential hard rocking bands of all time. Not sure where they go from here, but I do hope they don't wait 8 years to release new material now....this one really shows them still in the game.
B0013FNC38|5.0|It's a great album to listen to. There are quite a few good tracks on it. Just a good, chill album to listen to.
B000I2IT44|5.0|My acquaintance w/Porcupine Tree has only been for the past few years, & the majority of their CDs that I own are their latest releases.  In other words, I don't feel I have a very \\"historical perspective\\" of the band's catalogue.    Having made that disclaimer, I eagerly awaited getting to see a concert version of PT, & I was/am not disappointed.  In fact, I find the whole thing jaw-droppingly good.  Porcupine Tree is not a terrific visual act, such as KISS or Madonna; they just let their musical prowess say what needs to be said.    And what prowess!  I was pretty sure that Gavin Harrison's drumming would be stellar & it is.  The biggest revelation to me was how Richard Barbieri's keyboards soared over all the other instruments, creating a very unnerving & even at times frightening vibe.  Of course, that, to me, is the crux of Steven Wilson's worldview, that humanity has veered off track, leaving us a very uncertain future.  To have that uneasiness expressed musically was to me the glue that held the show together.     I'm not ignoring Steven; it just seems that as the creative force of the band, there is not much I can add that would not be drooling (I do enough of that uncontrolled at my age as it is).  It has actually taken me most of those several years I mentioned above to fully realize how he really is a worthy successor (all by himself) to say, Pink Floyd or King Crimson.    If I do have a complaint, it's about the effects used to make the image look like old newsreel footage, & perhaps too much jumping from color to black & white, but the music is strong enough to make these quibbles easily ignorable.  The second disc is a bit of a let-down length-wise, but still adds a couple extra live tracks, a bunch of photos, & a Gavin Harrison song called \\"Cymbal Song\\"; the title tells you what you're getting, but it is fascinating nonetheless.    All this has led to me making this final recommendation: get it!  You can always resell it right here.

B000KRNG5E|3.0|At its essence, Inferno tells a classic horror movie tale about a haunted house.  It's a bit odd, bombards the viewer with random, twisted imagery when least expected, attacks the senses with a kaleidoscope of colors, and overpowers the eardrums with pounding piano accompaniment.<br /><br />Beginning in what feels like a movie half-finished, a woman is reading a book about Three Mothers (Tenebrarum, Suspiriorum, and Lachrymarum).  Written by an architect/alchemist named Varelli, it tells of these three evil entities their resting places.  One such place is in New York, and the young lady, Rose, reading/translating the Latin book senses a connection to her surroundings.<br /><br />Even though I had to watch the introduction twice to understand it, with talks of mothers, keys, cellars, and what-not, the story sets up fairly well.  Although, the beginning is a little too packaged for most viewers, myself included, but from all that I have read of Argento, the zip-locked plot is not the important part.  The voice-over continuously leading both Rose and the viewer towards the next step is hilarious: \\"The second key is hidden in the cellar.\\"<br /><br />What follows is the meat of the story, doom and gloom awaits any who dare delve into the wickedness of not only the Three Mothers story, but also any who snoop around the house - the true star of the movie.  Characters die non-connected albeit creative deaths, as the world itself, ostensibly controlled by the Three Mothers, unleashes its fury.  Spectacular deaths, amazing in both their gore and their senselessness, it's horror for the sake of horror, with no pretense or worry about an in depth plot or protagonist.<br /><br />Being an Argento neophyte, I can say one thing without reservation about Inferno: This is absolutely not the right movie to start viewing his work.  For all of the movies in his oeuvre, and for all fans passionate fans, jumping straight into Argento's Inferno is a little too hot; there needs to be a period to adjust to the heat.  While the lighting, colors, and sets for some of the scenes are way ahead of their time, at times it feels like a movie directed by someone with severe ADHD, jumping from here to there without transition.  This movie is directed explicitly for the foreign horror connoisseur, a person with true passion for the legacy of horror.  I'm sure it's perfect for the target audience.  Granted it's an obviously older movie and can be appreciated as such, it's much too spastic and disconnected, not to mention extremely lacking in character development to actually create a new Argento fan.<br /><br />Beware the bag o'cats.While the lighting, colors, and sets for some of the scenes are way ahead of their time, at times it feels like a movie directed by someone with severe ADHD, jumping from here to there without transition.

B001C08RHA|4.0|What was enjoyable about Iron Man was that it was a smart addition to the Marvel Comics film adaptations. There are some action scenes, but they don't attempt to mask or steal the show or moral of the movie (that weapons in the wrong hands can have devastating results). After realizing that his father's company was inadvertently leading to the destruction of lives, and after having a terrifying experience being held hostage in the Middle East, multimillionaire Tony Stark (Downey) changes his tune of his invention-making ways, saying that he will not create anything aimed at destruction again. However, some information of making the perfect destructive machine has leaked, and now it is in the wrong hands. Sometimes the ones closest to you are the ones who turn against you, and now Tony battles both sides of evil.     Although the film was two hours, it was a quick two hours because of the pacing of the film. There aren't crash scenes that drag on for long periods of time, and the plot and script were well-written enough to keep all main characters involved in the climactic and critical scenes. The major characters all did great jobs in their roles: Gweneth Paltrow does a commendable job as Stark's assistant, and Jeff Bridges does an excellent job Stark's company business partner.     I would rank this film just a shade lower than Spiderman 2, but I think they are two of the best comic book movies out there in recent years.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Seriously, this album should come with an addiction warning.  Upon my first few listens, like many albums, it seemed merely a good album.  At first I did not like the electronic feel and overall production, which is a bit different from their earlier sound.      After a few listens, this feeling of musical addition was replaced with the understanding that this album is a true work of art: beautiful, symbolic, inspiring, chaotic, mesmerizing, thought provoking, and powerful.  The lyrics are profound and moving. Obvious themes of life, death, regret and gratitude dominate what one could call a deeply philosophical yet simple \\"concept album\\".      At the surface it is a bit more electronic and way more produced than their earlier albums, but it truly is brilliant.  The Lips again prove they are one of the greatest and most underrated bands of the last 20 years.
0307383415|4.0|Tackling Identity    Barack Obama's memoir, Dreams from My Father, recalls his adventure into understanding his heritage and identity. He effectively presents his story of searching for his self-identity in various ways. His memoir, which is separated into three parts- his childhood, life in Chicago and his journey to Africa, includes details of his hardships with belonging to two worlds. Obama's talent to write adds to the overall, heart-warming story of a boy growing-up in a half-white, half-black world, realizing his unknown heritage and family history.    The scenes he includes in his memoir effectively draws a picture to the readers of how difficult it was to live in a mixed culture. Obama explains his journey with the selected scenes from his past- those that were perhaps the hardest, the most interesting and those that forced him to live in the middle of two, fighting worlds. While living in Indonesia, Obama learned, \\"The world was violent, I was learning, unpredictable and often cruel\\" (37-38).  As a bi-racial child living in a segregated world, there was no safe ground for a young, confused boy. He adds this scene in to show readers that even as a child, he found conflict with his identity. Later, as a college student, Obama asks himself, \\"Where do I belong?\\" (115). This infers that the concept of identity hadn't been a one-time problem, but one that had been building up inside him over years. In addition, Obama added some scenes that created ethos with the readers. He mentioned that as a teenager \\"Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it\\" (93). A senator and presidential candidate, or a national leader, admitted to doing illegal activities. Obama specifically chose this scene to create ethos. He decides upon his scenes wisely; scenes that draw a picture to readers about his difficulties he encountered with his race and those that made the readers trust his words and story.    Obama also made the choice to divide his memoir into three parts- Origins, Chicago and Kenya. This created good transitions from one point in his life to the next. It showed the reader that the author grew, matured and discovered more about himself, but most importantly, his identity. As a teenager, he \\"[was] always playing the white man's court...by the white man's rules\\" (85). At that age, Obama doubted his ability to succeed and only played by the rules, never taking a step outside the lines. Even as an adult living in Chicago, he recognized the boundaries with a white girl friend:  I realized that our two worlds, my friend's and mine, were as distant from each other as Kenya is from Germany. And I knew that if we stayed together I'd eventually live in hers. After all, I'd been doing it most of my life. Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider (211).   With time and a trip to Africa, Obama, while still struggling with his identity, took a more mature approach to the situation. After a journey into his heritage he realized that \\"black and white, they make their claim on this community we call America\\" (439). Finally, after a life of living in two worlds, Obama accepted his mixed identity. His choice to divide the book into three allows the reader to transition successfully. Moreover, his choice to order Origins, Chicago and Kenya in that specific order adds to show the reader that the author matured through his life and found a solution to his inner conflict.    Furthermore, Obama used significant literary techniques to strengthen his overall writing and caught the attention of his readers. He used dialogue to successfully illustrate a scene. While in Kenya, Obama played basketball with his younger brother. Bernard says, \\"'Maybe I will come to America. I can help you with your business'   `I don't have a business right now. Maybe after I finish law school-'   `It must be easy to find work'   `Not for everybody. Actually, lots of people have a tough time in the States. Black people especially'\\" (326).  Obama's choice to use dialogue instead of a narrative to explain a scene, shortens the passage and also makes the scene more interesting to the reader.    Overall, Dreams from My Father was an impressive memoir for its content and its writing. The story validated that America has become more of a melting pot- because Obama is a product of it. No longer are we racially separated, but becoming a mix of races and cultures. His story is one of the mixed heritage stories of America- but merely every American has their own.         H.Surman

It starts by exlaining the eight steps to getting started, including floor plans, finding inspiration, and budgeting.  All types of rooms imaginable are covered by seperate chapters, each ending with a beautiful example of a room from one of the actual authors' homes.  The Decorator's Handbook section in the back is a great reference for all types of decor lingo.    The book is jam packed with beautiful full-color pictures on each page, vivid examples of how to go about creating you dream decor.  All styles and tastes are covered.  THe book even comes with a ribbon bookmark attached.    If you are going to purchase just one book to help you with your decorating needs, I would highly recommend this one.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|While this is a good album, it's certainly no Master of Puppets, or even ..And Justice For All. All of the reviews I have read that are \\"praising\\" Metallica's efforts are just the ramblings of dedicated fans who want to see the greatest of the thrash metal bands claim that crown again. But sadly, this album is not great enough for that. While some tracks (Cyanide,The Judas Kiss)  are awesome songs, they are really lacking in progressed creativity. They do however seem to be similar to songs of old. But, we must remember the last three albums and admit that this was a last ditch effort to redeem themselves in the eye's of their fans. Nice try 'Tallica' , but no cigar. Even though they have sold over 2 million copies at the time of this post, name brands alway's sell but do not alway's deliver.<br />  I encourage you to pick one up, it does have some great songs, but if you want a truly great metal album, pick up Megadeth's United Abominations.You will then see the true \\"creative\\" genius of Metallica (besides Cliff Burton RIP) and come to understand that Dave Mustaine is seriously underrated.<br /> Sorry to all die hard Metallica heads, but that's the truth in my opinion.

B00127RAJY|2.0|I thought this was just an Ok workout--I'm actually surprised to see all the really high reviews it got, and had expected it to be a really intense workout, but was disappointed.      I think the cardio bursts are great, my heart rate stayed elevated the entire time, and I was definitely sweating throughout.      However, I felt the video was really weak when it came to strength-training.  I never felt a burn in my abs or legs, and only slightly in my arms (with 5 lb weights).  I will probably still use this workout, but only as a cardio workout on days I don't want to strength train or do anything intense. I think if you are in fairly good shape and workout pretty often, this will offer a quick cardio routine, but I don't think it offers much strength-training for the intermediate level.
B0000696IE|4.0|This is not an essential Halloween movie, but it is really great. It's a science fiction movie that shows us aspects of the human condition.<br /><br />Elliot (12 or so) is basically an outsider. His older brother and friends are not exactly cruel to him, but they do make him feel like they are doing him a favor by allowing him to participate in their activities. Later, Elliot runs into E.T. Basically, because Elliot is an outsider, he is more receptive to accepting someone else who is an outsider.<br /><br />To make a long story short, Elliot gradually convinces his older brother (Mike) and his younger sister (Gertie) to help get E.T. home. (He was accidentally left behind by his friends.) It is interesting how in their compassion for E.T., the civil disputes between Elliot, Michael, and Gertie seem to disappear.<br /><br />If we want to get really technical, there is a moment in the classroom where we see that Elliot and E.T. have a link. And in science class, Elliot frees all the frogs that were going to be cut up for study. (Later, we will see that this has relevance to the climax.)<br /><br />Moving on, there is the Halloween moment of the show. E.T. hopes to call his people to get him home, and Halloween is the one night where he could easily be mistaken for just a kid trick or treating. But this is when trouble starts.<br /><br />There are other people who are interested in E.T. for possibly less than kind reasons. But this leads to a climactic and comical chase to get E.T. home.<br /><br />Overall it's a great movie science fiction movie that shows us about the acceptance of outsiders.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I'm one of the few people who felt that the Atari 2600 game \\"E.T.\\" really wasn't so bad.
1416594884|2.0|As a long time admirer of David Cornwell's writing it is discouraging to have to say that this is a dull book.  The characters are drawn with chalk.  There is little nuance, and the emotions are stated, not shown.  What is bad and what is good is not described, it is stated as it would be in an annual report.  The unrequited and tired love of the participants reads like it would in a chemistry text.  Finally, the complexity of the conflicts between east and west is ignored in favor of simple US bashing.  In this novel our intelligence agencies are overwhelmingly heavy handed and the people working for them are crude, unsophisticated bullies.  This would be understandable and expected from someone from the far left who opposed combating terror regardless of the consequences.   But this is a rant from a novelist who has written well of conflict in the past.  It is sad to see a book like this where the tension evaporates half way through.  The outcome is obvious.      There are both real and imaginary problems that western governments have to deal with every day.  And there may be a Robin Hood or two who, in addition to those in the Army who are charged with compensating for errors, are helping those who have been unjustly harmed by their actions.  Unfortunately, however, the real challenges far outnumber the imaginary and ignoring them may have much more devastating consequences.  This is a replay of Absolute Friends without a hail of bullets at the end.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Shelter was touted as being the next Brokeback Mountain when I first read reviews.  I wouldn't say it's quite to that level but it is a nice story.  I also like the fact that it's a gay themed movie focused on a love story without the need of nudity (much to the chagrin of some I'm sure).  It's this type of movie that I feel will have a more positive influence on society's acceptance of the gay community.<br /><br />It's a story about a young guy who is either closeted or unaware of his gay nature until that one special person comes into his life.  It shows his struggle of accepting himself while also showing the fear he experiences while contemplating what effect the revelation of his discovery will have on his family...especially his relationship with his nephew who has come to revere him as a father.  He tries to force a heterosexual relationship but ultimately can't escape his emotional and sexual attraction to someone he's known throughout his life.  It shows the level of emotional stress that he faces not only with his sexuality but also with the support that he must provide to his family.  The complexity of the emotions is a struggle that many of us in the gay community can relate to.<br /><br />I've actually been purchasing this movie as gifts because I think the story is very well presented.
0312427999|1.0|If you like Michael Moore style propaganda then you just might like this book. As for me, I think it's garbage and I can't even finish reading it. I really try to keep an open mind, but Naomi Klein distorts facts, takes quotes out of context, and fudges on her chronology in order to force the spread of capitalism to fit with her analogy of torture. The first 40 pages or so don't even talk about capitalism, but rather Klien goes on a tirade about the CIA's record on shock therapy and torture. Klien goes on further to juxtapose these stories of shock-torture with Milton Freidman's spread of capitalism. With all the explicit bias that's in the book it's impossible for a rational, fair minded human being to read it as anything other than an alternative history. Rather, this book says much more about the author's blatant social bias than it does about anything that Milton Freidman has done or has advocated for. Klien seems to believe that all things should be controlled by the government and takes great displeasure in seeing \\"public wealth\\" being \\"transferred\\" into the hand of private citizens. Power in the hands of the people, isn't that democracy? One example from the book she takes exception with is the privatization of the schools in New Orleans after Katrina, and speaks about this as if it were the worst thing in the world. Never mind that the schools in New Orleans were HORRIBLE before Katrina, but are now doing much, MUCH, better because of the voucher system. Poor parents were finally able to take their kids out of failing schools and put them in better performing ones. Sounds like capitalism saved the day there. Anyway, I could rant further about this sad piece of literature, but I won't. And if you don't want to take my word for it, go read the review by Reason magazine before you buy. Maybe you'll change your mind about wasting money on this book...I wish I would have.
B0013ND30W|5.0|OK, I always thought Sleeping Beauty was one of Disney's least exciting offerings from their classic animation films. Although I saw in the theaters when I was very young, I mostly know it from the VHS version. But my wife said it was her favorite so when it came out on Blu Ray, I picked it up.    Just a few points on why it is so impressive. First, the BR version displays the full original aspect ratio, you get to see the film in full Cinemascope. Second, the transfer to BR looks flawless, you'll see details in the animation you didn't know where there. I kept staring at it in awe. Finally, the sound quality was full and clean.    So put that all together and it actually makes the semi-flat characters come alive and the kinda lame plot seem exciting. Overall, BR gave me a new appreciation for Sleeping Beauty, and I can't wait for future Disney BR releases. (Beauty and the Beast next, please?)      Oh, and how awesome is it that they threw in the DVD version too?

0783225849|5.0|How many times have I seen this classic movie?  I am thinking 45 would be a low estimate.  This low-budget Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece is what I consider his best movie.  There are many great scenes in here for a cinematographer/director to study if they had a class in Movie Production 101.  They have been copied many times in sincerest flattery, but never duplicated.  They are: Janet Leigh's driving along with the embezzled money in the hammering rain.  The windshield wipers are keeping time to the eerie background music as we study her facial features. Janet Leigh getting pulled over by the highway patrolman and her nervousness at the stolen money being discovered.  We watch as she has to move the bundle of money out of the way to retrieve her driver's licence in her purse for the patrolman.  Her arrival at the Bates Motel, and the forboding appearance of the building, the foreshadowing. The stuffed wildlife on display and the mannerisms of Norman Bates, played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. Perkins' voyerism of Leigh as she is in the motel room. The eye through the peephole shot as a parallelsim to Leigh's later eye shot.  The famous shower scene. The ethereal form of the slasher behind the shower curtain.  The eerie music, mimicking the slashing movements, Leighs' terror and clawing and grasping at the shower curtain.  The \\"dead-eye\\" shot of Leigh in the bathtub, the \\"blood\\" running to the drain, the drain mimicking the round eye, the symbolism of the life ebbing, going down the drain. Janet Leigh's discovered car being pulled out of the boggy water with a rope. The \\"fall\\" of Martin Balsam down the huge staircase in the big house. The pained conversations of Bates with his mother.  The scene of the taxidermied mother in the chair in the basement and finally Norman Bates conversations with self as a fly buzzes around him at the police station. We must also mention John Gavin, simply for his ability to project gorgeous male-ness, of the tall, dark and handsome variety.  If you need a Halloween Treat and have not seen the movie, this would be \\"it.\\"  Of course if you have, nothing is ever ruined by seeing it again.  It never gets old.ariety.

B0014VPFTA|4.0|John Mayer is a talented musician, coming forth with a momentous blues flair. Mayer grasps a Stevie Ray Vaughan like vocal style, but manages to stray far enough to make his own unique writing style. While lyrically he isn't too impressive, the way the music and words swimmingly connect indubitably make up for it.<br /><br />Guitar work is often subjected to speed equals talent. With \\"Continuum\\" one might realize the delicate, but rather tight guitar segments are works of art that require much consistency (something many guitarist lack). Pulsating rhythmic flows really add to the character of  track 5 \\"The Heart of Life\\". One may already be familiar with the single<br />\\"Waiting On The World To Change\\" due to extensive airplay, none the less it remains a catchy radio staple. Many of the tracks feel fire place warm and inviting to the dismays the songs underline. The realizations and pictures in ones mind \\"Stop This Train\\" paints is memorable. While warm, the songs drift. Some songs feel dragged out or filler like, but it could be due to the slow pace. The album never fully utilizes a over drive, and has no need to.<br /><br />The undeniable single coil blues driven guitar sound is there. The production quality and vocals there. Replay value their! The variety of songs offered is a handful of listening pleasure. 4/5
6305313687|4.0|The only negative thing that I have to say about this movie is the sterotype on skinheads. Not all skinheads are Nazis. Actually, it's only about 10% of the skinhead population that are white supremisists. I personally am not a skinhead but I have friends that are who are completely against that sect of skinheadism and don't even consider those who do fit the racist neo-nazi mold to be real skinheads in the first place. You should check out a documentary called Dark Planet:Visions of America to get a real, unbiased look at the skinhead scene.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I have to admit, the first 15-20 minutes of this movie I was wondering whether I was going to be able to get into it. Then, when Brendan is trying to figure out what the A means, I got sucked in. Honestly, I thought it was fantastic and the story itself is great. The dialogue was kind of weird at first, but it really fits the film A+++    And I'd like to address the reviewer who said this is another film where the kids don't appear to have parents and he couldn't believe that high school kids were running a complicated drug operation. This is the way a startling percentage of the population of this country grows up. Alot of parents are too busy working to pay attention to their children and teenagers are not as dumb as most people think. When they're motivated, a highly efficient drug operation is no problem.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|To be honest, I had my doubts about the \\"new Metallica\\" after a string of lackluster albums by the now legendary heavy metal quartet.   Following the Mega-Platinum \\"Black Album\\", Metallica released a couple of albums (\\"Load\\" and \\"ReLoad\\") that each featured several heavy hitting singles, such as the adrenaline injected \\"Fuel\\", bookmarked by less than superb \\"ho-hum\\" filler songs.   Not bad songs, but also not anything to write home about.   Then, coinciding with the meltdown of the relationship between the remaining original three members (James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett) and bassist Jason Newsted, the band spent several years crawling inside their own psyches and egos to produce the atrociously written, recorded and produced 2003's \\"St. Anger\\", a decided exercise in rage and futility, which saw much of the band's long-faithful fanbase left scratching their collective banging heads.   This was all documented in the film \\"Some Kind of Monster\\", a fascinating look into the inner workings of the band that I highly recommend, but that's a different review.   At the end of the \\"St. Anger\\" recording timeline, the band welcomed in new bassist Robert Trujillo, a veteran bassist most recently of Ozzy Osbourne's touring band.   Though the \\"St. Anger\\" album became a scapegoat for all that was \\"wrong\\" with Metallica, and saw the end of their working relationship with Bob Rock (who had produced their greatest commercially successful album), and was probably the most brutal critical failure the \\"world's most successful metal band\\" had seen, as they usually do, Metallica hit the road on a huge world tour and drove forward with the usual headstrong live performances that made them household names to begin with.    And so, the band entered the studio in 2006 to begin work on their next album with Trujillo and veteran producer Rick Rubin in tow.   Vowing a return to their heavy sound and to their thrash metal roots, the band spent nearly two full years writing and recording the new album, in well-guarded secrecy, taking breaks in between to do several shorter tours including a european tour where they performed 1986's Metalli-masterpiece \\"Master of Puppets\\" in it's entirety (I'd have paid a LOT to have been at one of those shows...).   And not unlike it's preceding album (St. Anger), the arrival of \\"Death Magnetic\\" comes with some amount of controversy, with a large contingent of fans upset with the overall mastering of the album, claiming it has been mastered to disc at too loud a recording volume, resulting in distortion and clipping when played at loud volume.   The band have stuck to their proverbial guns, standing by the finished result, which has dominated sales charts for weeks following it's release, and the first single \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" has gotten regular rotation on AOR playlists as well.    So, after hearing \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" several times on the web as well as radio and video, I was mixed on the sound quality issue mentioned before by the Metallica \\"pundits\\", as there seemed to be a bit of the distortion and clipping cited by the \\"complainants\\", but wanting to be objective, I decided to wait until I'd heard a copy of the actual disc before rushing to any conclusions.   I had also heard various snippets from the album via a downloaded \\"Guitar Hero III\\" video game patch, which to me sounded pretty good.   Last week, I stopped by a record store, and spotted a copy of \\"Death Magnetic\\" used for 10 bucks and decided I'd give it a chance.   What I found was none of the aforementioned audio problems.   To be honest, the disc is mixed at a very high volume, but even when I turned it up to the proverbial \\"11\\" I didn't notice any of the distortion or clipping, on either home stereo, or in the car.   Musically, I have to say I'm VERY impressed.   To me at least, this album sounds and feels like the proper follow-up to \\"And Justice For All...\\" or the \\"black\\" album.   The guitars are decidedly more raw sounding onthe heavier parts, and surprisingly soft and beautiful during the mellower sections.   The lyrical content (credited entirely to Hetfield) is typical Hetfield fare, dealing with questions of life and death, pain and redemption, etc., and the vocal performance is also typical Hetfield, complete with \\"rrah's\\" on the end of the lines of verse, but well delivered and, like the guitars, powerful and mellow in the right spots.   Trujillo's bass performance is good and if not always noticeable in the mix, it is a quality performance that fits the material perfectly, and there are certain spots throughout the album where the bass is in the forefront for his talent to shine.   The drums are tight and ferocious with typical Ulrich blast beats and double-bass stomping, the only drawback is the sound of the drums, which while light-years better than the tin can din of \\"St. Anger\\", still sounds a bit tinny and the cymbals sound a bit flat.   I'll chalk this up to the way Lars tunes his drumkit, and the way he prefers it to be mic'd rather than cite some problem with the production, as the rest of the instruments sound pretty damn good.   The real strength of this album is it's songwriting and arrangements.   Driven from the outset by the fiery and complex guitar riffs, the songwriting is powerful and precise, with complex time changes that at times become a bit dense such as the closing section of \\"The Day That Never Comes\\", but never overwhelm the structure of the song to obscure the focus of the song.   The arrangements are particularly different from recent albums in that there is a lot of variety in tempo and their signature time changes are razor sharp, and there are many of the \\"thrash metal\\" superspeed galloping rhythms, harkening back to their first four albums, but it never feels forced or out of place.   Each song is in itself, a complete statement of it's own, and the Metallica machine never gets bogged down in songs that seem to repeat other hits from the past, or other songs on the album as on \\"Load\\" and \\"Re-Load\\", and the overall production and mix from Rubin is raw and sparse which really lets the instruments shine instead of bogged down in the mix as they were on \\"St. Anger\\".   All in all, the performance is tight and furiously paced, and \\"Death Magnetic\\" is, in my opinion, a real return to form for arguably the most successful both commercially and critically heavy metal band yet.    Highlights for me would include the heavy groove-laden \\"The End Of The Line\\" and \\"Cyanide\\", the furious \\"All Nightmare Long\\", and a great instrumental piece, \\"Suicide & Redemption\\".   There is also the third installment in the ongoing Unforgiven saga \\"Unforgiven III\\" which feels similar to the namesake song from the black album, but also has it's own appeal.   Overall, a great album by a band for which greatness is both expected and needed.    I'd give it 4 and a half stars, but it'll only let me give 4 or 5, so I said 4 due to the drum sound.    ***For all the I-pod/download types out there, the sound quality of all the downloadable patches I've heard of the new Metallica are FAR inferior to the sound of the actual cd.   This might be the source of the \\"Mastering\\" controversy.  You might want to buy the cd and load the songs onto your I-tunes or whatever yourself, and load your I-pod that way.
1416575464|5.0|I love this book! It's well laid out and thorough, the pictures are inspiring, and it addresses how to incorporate stuff you already have into charming eclectic rooms.  It's one of the few decorating books I've seen that didn't incite feelings of guilt and inadequacy for not getting rid of everything I own and starting over, from Shabby Chic to Industrial. The rooms pictured are not intended to be duplicated, but rather show how a combination of styles and colors can be personal and charming, and YOU CAN DO IT! I've made peace with three fairly awful rooms in my own house, but after several hours of reading this book I found myself wandering around muttering, \\"Hmmmmm..., if I move this there, and paint that another color, and...\\"<br /><br />Whew--that was close!  Pause for some deep breaths.<br /><br />I'm OK now.<br /><br />Beginning with \\"The Entryway\\", each room by room section is written by a different author and contains several style choices, a discussion of color and major furniture pieces and what to consider when purchasing, how to combine different furniture and accessory styles, decorating tricks and small space solutions, finishing touches, as well as a personal essay from the section's author on how he/she dealt with design issues in the room.<br /><br />This is a book to curl up with and daydream about sofas and circus tent ceilings and chintz covered screens, without breaking a sweat or the bank!<br />And if you do decide to take the plunge, this book empowers the reader to do as much or as little as taste and means dictate. My kind of book!
B001CD6FKI|3.0|This movie gave me a big headache. So much crap going on so quickly for over two hours got a little old. This movie is perfect for ADHD kids whose concentration only lasts for a short period of time but for the rest of us it becomes vomit enducing to sit through this film.    The things I liked about this film is the cool graphics and race car scenes. The plot was a little thin but that's okay for a Speed Racer show. I thought some of the acting was really good with John Goodman and the main evil dude. I liked how this was very family friendly. Not a lot of over the top violence, no sex and very little, if any, swearing.    The things I didn't like about the film is that the film was a little too busy with too much going on the screen at the same time. (maybe I shouldn't have watched it when I had the flu). I thought that Speed Racer's brother and the monkey were a little lame as well.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|I would give this movie a rating of 6 stars if I could. Based on true story with great acting and drama. Director Debbouze did it again.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna Summer has been gone for a bit..but comes back and is taking names! Buy it!
0439023483|5.0|I lost sleep over this book because I could not put it down.  It is very fast paced and exciting.  I cannot wait to see what else Suzanne Collins has in store for readers.

B0019T9FL6|4.0|The is a very good CD, and deserves to be in anyones collection, Jennifer sounds great on all sellections.
0307455874|5.0|I read mostly non-fiction, but very few political or religious books in comparison to my total reading.     The Audacity of Hope was not quite what I expected. It was more. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is appreciative of thought process and insight. What appeals to me mostly, I think, is Senator Obama's desire and ability to view things from many sides. This keeps one humble.     I have to agree with Chris Buckley,(sp?): Mr. Obama has a classic mind, -with the potential of being a great leader. He has my prayers and my support.  Mickey T.
0307386171|5.0|He tells a story about a couple that avoids saying what is on their minds because they simply don't know how to put it into words.  Well that is how I feel right now when trying to describe Ian McEwan. I cannot praise him enough. His prose is brilliant. His depth and exploration into human emotion is a work of genius. And his attention to detail is unsurpassed.      When I read Ian McEwan, I think of literary greats from years past. And I think he is one of the best writers today.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|This DVD is very enjoyable.  I have watched it several times, alone and with friends.  I think the women have very light, angelic voices.
B001EE719O|5.0|Containing none of their big hits except Angie, one of my least favorite Stone songs, this album still delivers a wide range of sounds when the Stones are still experimenting with moods and directions. Their contemporary releases sounds all similar to me, but that may be due to time and a growing familiarity with Goat's Head Soup, an \\"album,\\" now CD and MP3s, that contains some of my most played Stone singles.
B001CC7PP8|1.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE LEGACY EDITION DVD--THE BLU RAY IS AMAZING (5-stars) AND WORTH DOUBLE DIPPING (or in my case triple dipping).<br /><br />I am not a techno wiz so I have no idea what it takes to remaster an older movie, but this was NO different than the collector's edition that came out several years ago. I was very disappointed as there is still a ton of specs during the movie and it's very grainy. In fact I am not sure this isn't WORSE than the one before. If they can take a movie from 1940 (It's a Wonderful Life) and make it almost flawless, why couldn't they do it to Psycho, which was made 20 years later. Very disappointing. The special features are all fine but half of them were on the other disc too. But regardless, you buy a dvd for the film and this is a major let down. I want my $20 back.
055358894X|4.0|I just finished reading this novel and I am happy to report it was better than I expected it to be. I had purchased this one a while ago and it sat on my \\"to be read\\" shelf for some time. At least its turn came and almost immediately I was drawn into the complex but beautifully laid out world of Locke Lamora. The overall premise is very basic, as several other reviewers have already noted. It has an air of Oliver Twist to it, with some good old fashioned betrayal and revenge mixed in. I fully enjoyed the mix of plots and characters which I think were all well drawn by the author. Some of which I thought were so well done they could carry a story of their own (I can only hope). I also liked how the story would allude to a long forgotten \\"alien\\" civilization but did not delve too deep and take away the momentum of the story. Which brings me to my next point, pacing. The story was very well paced which is to say it moved along at warp speed, the pages will fly by if you give this one a chance. I read that this is the first of a projected series and I hope that all of the successive novels in this series are as good as this one was.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|As one of the true classic films of the golden age of Hollywood, and one of the two cinematic productions of the Iriving Berlin musical, Holiday Inn is welcome in any format.  The `new' presentation includes both a color and b/w edition of the film on separate discs AND a soundtrack CD of all the music from the film.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed the `original' versions of films pre-colorization, but this time, the fine folks at Universal have managed to do an exceptional job of updating this film for new film goers.  Edith Heads' assistant provided input into the process  to make the costuming more accurate and consistant.  This time, the color is not a distraction, but a bonus.<br /><br />We know the story, a small out of the way Inn becomes the center for a series of period and holiday based musicals.  Bing and Fred `duel' for the affections of the lead actress/dancer and in the end, true love wins out for both men (and women).  The musical score by Berlin is remarkable, and even today sets toes a tapping out he jazzy beat.  The first appearance of White Christmas is just one of the jewels on this DVD.<br /><br />[...]
B001C08RHA|5.0|THIS WAS JUST WELL ROUNDED FUN MOVIE AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO FOR POPCORN ONCE AFTER IT STARTED.
B001DDBCUU|2.0|Over acted, actresses too old to play their parts. Please, Samantha can get over herself anytime. Fifty years old and still playing the I'm hot and horny teenage tramp role? I just didn't buy it. Those STUPID hats that Carrie wears? Forget it. It's like they are little girls playing dressup. I wish I had saved my money. Live and learn. The people I let borrow it said it was a waste of their time also. SJParker has made enough money. She looked haggerd, and her hair always looks oily for some reason. Time to retire, sweetie and retire to the good life. People are already talking about you. Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis Still have a lot to give. They are beautiful, and act very well. They aren't older trying to act like they are still in their twenties. Kim...If it were not for Sex, you would only , maybe be remembered for a ditzy cop, and a manniquin, and it doesn't take much acting for either role.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|IN THE ALTERNATE OPENING WHEN THE HULK CAUSED AN AVALANCHE YOU CAN SEE ON THE LOWER LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN A MISCOLORED PICE OF ICE-YEP ITS CAPTIN AMERICA ENCASED IN A BLOCK OF ICE THAT SHIFTS POSITION FOR 3-4 FRAMES HES GOT HIS SHIELD ON HIS LEFT SIDE.  I THOUGHT IORN MAN WAS BETTER FOR THE CGI AND HULK WAS BETTER FOR THE ACTION AND THE TAC.
B000QUT9RY|5.0|These speakers are exactly what I wanted - digital input, solid, balanced sound, fairly small.  There are two volume knobs - one for the digital source, one for analog.  I'm not using analog right now, but it is nice that it mixes the two.    The only caveat about these speakers, which is a theory of mine not supported by any information from the manufacturer (but it makes sense to me)... is that these are 'stereo' speakers, and I believe they are playing only the front right and front left channels from a 5.1 digital source.  When I listen to a source I know is stereo, they are normally loud and sound good.  When I listen to a source I know is 5.1 (like a DVD), the sound is much lower, and voices are even lower than ambient sounds.  Which I think makes sense as voices are often mixed to the center channel in a 5.1 mix.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|As an old school Metallica fan, I did not know what to expect when I popped this CD in for the first time.  After an all too long series of disappointments since And Justice, I was relieved to hear an album that actually sounded like the Metallica I know and love.  Back are the characteristic drums rifs of Lars (still don't understand what I heard on St. Anger).  Back are Kirk's intense guitar solos.  Back are the long, epic songs.  Back is an impactful instrumental.  No, it's not RTL or MOP, but it would be tough to ever beat the mastery of those defining albums.  But it is an album that again demonstrates the pioneering talents of the band.  One that I hope is the start of new chapter for the band; one that is more like the beginning.
