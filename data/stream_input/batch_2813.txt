B009XIXVU6|5.0|My book club chose this and it's an awesome read.<br />I will have to read this author's other books.<br />The book weaves earlier era and modern times in a very graceful and interesting manner.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Always worthwhile and informative, TED offers a wide variety of excellent lectures in an amazing array of subjects in a great variety of lengths - from a few minutes to much longer.  They run from the technically difficult to the amazingly simple but in all cases one comes away from any one lecture better informed than at the beginning.
0525478817|4.0|The best part of this book is the fast, tight, and witty dialogue between the main characters.  However, I'm not sure most people have the intelligence or wit to converse so seamlessly.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|While I fully understand and am able to use fractions, this is a quick and easy guide particularly if one has to deal with uncommon fractions.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series, I waited anxiously to catch up with season 3.  Finally, the 3rd season is free with prime.  Catch up before season 4 starts in January 2014.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I have quite a few Joe Bonamassa cd's because he's a great blues person. Adding Beth hart just made this one fantastic.They seen to feed off each other.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was the best be caused it tied up all the loose ends and had a happy ending also gave insight to what some one would do with the kind of that power.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love how you can get gift, decoration, hair, and so many more ideas!!! Not only that but I can put my own twist on things to either help keep cost down or just change it just because!!!
B005H29GSI|3.0|The Angry Birds On Thin Ice game, is a fun enough addition to the other Angry Birds Board Games.  Like the other Angry Birds board games, there is a deck of cards that shows players options for stages they can build in order to earn points and beat the other players.  Unfortunately, the ice part didn't seem to work that well for me, they either stuck together so hard that nothing would break them or were so flimsy that they wouldn't stay together long enough to stack the intended stage.  After not that long, my nine year old son and six year old daughter gave up in frustration. The slingshot still gets some use and they have fun playing with the pieces, but they never play the game itself.  In the end, I'm not sure the set itself is worth it.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|well made quality t rex with moveable jaw... nicely coloured and a favourite with my dinosaur loving little girl age 3
B0053TMP24|4.0|It was a pretty good book, the thing I don't like about Rick Riordan is that basically he just makes evening that talented before happen again... there's really nothing new.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I got this knowing it was just a guide, but it's not even helpful. Just random stuff thrown together. Wasted time and space on my kindle!
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Exquisitely sensitive, well written, it touched my very much. I will search for more books by this author. Thank you.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Awesome CD. I love some songs better than others, but overall I like the entire CD.<br />Macklemore & Ryan Lewis are incredible artists.<br />Definitely a must have CD, if you hip hop with a twist.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I can't seem to stop playing once I start. I usually quit when the battery warning message pops up. The music is rather soothing; useful for limiting frustration.
B000000OU0|5.0|Great addition to my collection and got here fast too! I loved the Eagles and this one I did not have! Thanks for the help!!! :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|TV at its best.  Great story, actors and commentary about society at a point in time.  This is an accurate portrayal of British society life.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|So happy to get these cd's and have a piece of my teen years back! Cannot stop smiling thanks for the memories and the great cd!
B0079K4WEE|5.0|I have watched my share of foreign films and most are very good. I found this story real and compelling as a real life love story. The acting is very good and I loved the parts where a facial expression told a compete story. There's no violence, only a complicated and entertaining story of compelling love.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love these stories BBC brings us, I don't like how much they cost; so I appreciate saving some dollars and getting to receive my own copy! Thanks for the rapid shipping too!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Be sure you have plenty of time to sit and read once you start this novel, because you won't be able to put it down. Some of the reviews said it &#34;wasn't for the squeamish&#34; and that initially made me hesitate, but because I love Gillian Flynn, I decided to try it anyway. I am very squeamish, and yes, some scenes describing the murders and animal brutality were hard to read, but they were so eloquently part of the story, you could read through them, knowing they weren't gratuitous violence, but there were clues within to help you solve the mystery. Which, by the way, you won't, which makes this book even more of a delicious read!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Thanks for the great dvd and the wonderful memories too! Now I can rewatch  when I want!!! Thanks for the memories
B0001US62I|5.0|I love the extended version of this film. The plot of this film had me going, all the way until the very end, and then I was like &#34;Wow, that's messed up&#34;. But, in a good way. Lisa Bonet did a good job in this film as well. It's a good thing that I believe in karma and try very hard not to do anything that'll come back and bite me in my hind-end. This is one film, of several,  that will always be a cult-classic favorite of mine.
B006LR0XLM|3.0|Nice app to use if your in a pinch. I have used a few time already. the only drawback is my work's IT policy limits access to sites such as dropbox so its useless to use for work. However, nice to use with homework.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app wont load any pics from my gallery, facebook, etc. I guess you get what you pay for. Please fix asap...
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy.  My only complaint is that the character of Teresa got portrayed in a negative light that didn't seem entirely fair.  Thomas, at least, should have realized she was trying to protect him and forgiven her.  It seems that Teresa's motives were more pure than Brenda's, actually.  In fact, the story is crying out for another book to continue Thomas' adventures.  Come on Mr. Dashner!  Please consider this!
B000P0J0D8|5.0|This movie is a love story but surrounded by violence.  Not for children. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette star with Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie.<br /><br />People will do anything for love. Do not miss this all star cast. A great movie to add to your collection.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I love this movie.  The cast is great and the story keeps moving our heroes forward to what we all know today.  Kevin Bacon as the bad guy is just perfect.  Watch this movie.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I have about 7 nice editing apps. This is another. It is at least as nice as the others. This has to be included with any others that I say are the best. And it was FREE, so I give it an extra nod for that. Not sure how one could stand out above the others, guess we'll see. Thank you Amazon App of the day!
B004FP1WX0|1.0|I don't even know how to begin to describe how horrible this movie was. According to the trailer, &#34;Catfish&#34; is some kind of Hichcock-ish psychological thriller. Well, there is nothing thrilling about this story, whatsoever.  I had it all figured out in the first 20 minutes, although I kept waiting for something ... ANYTHING to happen. Nothing. Zilch. Nada.<br /><br />Just $2.99 and 1 hour, 26 ridiculous minutes of my life that I will never get back.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. I can play it for hours. Reminds me like being at a carnival. Best of all it's a free game
B000NY12LO|4.0|It was a good summer read. Brings a lot of thought to what can happen in nineteen minutes. Enjoy the author style of writing.
B00AYB16EO|5.0|Great comedy for that Friday night, movie night. Will give you great laughs. An overall great movie with plenty of sequels.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I enjoyed this summer read, it is sad but I liked all the twist and turns that this author presented.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I've played in years! You won't be sorry you entered this room I guarantee. it!
0345529057|5.0|I think I'm doing this backwards, but I've been watching the series, and NOW am reading the books. I've highly enjoy the show, but it's amazing how much more could have been including int the video telling of the saga. I think having &#34;seen&#34; the actors chosen for the parts enhances the majority, while in some case makes me want for some of the actors to be more flawed, to match the book's story telling. Mr. Martin tells a great story. Glad it has been given more flesh in the video/movie genre. Hope you will enjoy it too!
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I have watch this movie several times love it each time. I glad I have the DVD! It is one of the best super hero movies of all times.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We loved watching this movie with our daughter who is 2.5 years old. It was very entertaining for all of us.
0385523386|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. The condition of the book was excellent when I received it and I am just overall satisfied.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A touching, witty, uplifting, heartbreaking tale of young love and self discovery. John Green hit another home run.  My favorite of his writings.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is very addicting. The only thing I don't like is that it's very expensive to do expansions and buy dragons and habitats.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I've watched it a dozen times and will continue to watch it over and over.  I see something new every time I watch it.  It's a classic!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I chose this review because the group is just amazing and they deserve a great review on their book. Love you guys.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|I got this for my child's birthday and it has been a big hit.  He even likes this better than some of the \\"louder\\" toys, which I am eternally thankful for.  This is a perfect toy for small hands to learn how to screw and unscrew things and it has sparked a lot of conversation about space and astronauts.  I would purchase this again in a heartbeat!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I've always loved Gaga, and have admired her innovation throughout the years. This song at first, seemed disappointing and like it was missing something. But I was wrong, I listened to it a few more times and then realized what this song is. It is a transitional piece into a somewhat more substantial and complex. The song has some artpop (genre) elements to it, its not just a major chord progression, but some complex melodies and dynamic changes. I love this song, and can't wait for the full album of ARTPOP. Love you mother monster!
B00364K6YW|5.0|Ordered this movie to replace the one my granddaughter decided to skate across the floor on...lol. Movie arrived very quickly and at an awesome price! Great seller...will buy from them again.
1449437524|5.0|Great coffee table book. The art is wonderful, the humor is great. Guests love it. And know I know what my dog is thinking when I accidentally kick him. Hilarious.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|Probably works if you are a teenage girl.  The stories are silly and the writing is weak.  It reminds me of the junk on tv.
B000002KLZ|5.0|Saw the Mac a few weeks ago and they still rock.  Rock and roll will never age or never die in this heart.  Thanks for awesome service in fine condition too.  Appreciate that.
B005USZYDU|3.0|I thought it was entertaining however I still want to know what happened to Duffy ; I assumed they would have found them in the series of three!
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Taylor Swift's second album, Fearless, has been my favorite so far. I enjoy watching these talented young people who take on the world and rise to the top! My favorites from the album are White Horse, Love Story, and the one that I enjoy most, You Belong With Me. Swift does a good job of translating her teen years into a package that resonates, not only with other teenagers, but adults, as well. For me, it evokes both fond and disappointing memories from my own teen years. It helps that she has such interesting videos to accompany my favorite songs. Knowing that Taylor had such a great input into the lyrics, the music, and the videos helps me to appreciate her and her amazing talent.
0399255370|5.0|My therapy dog Dwayne and I read to children at the library, or kids read to Dwayne.  The children love to color after we read (Dwayne likes to eat crayons), This will be our book for this Saturday, crayons and pages to color afterwards.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Bruno Mars for awhile and love this entire album. As a dancer, I love that each of the tracks makes me want to get up and move. Love his lyrics, love the rhythms.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series, I've cried and laughed through it. It has inspired me to stand up for something I believe in, and if I need to, rebel against it to make a point. I'm truly excited to see the movie and hopefully they don't mess it up too much.
0345803507|1.0|Yes, I'm embarrassed to say I read all three books.  They are repetitious, poorly written, and the characters have no substance.  Ana is a spineless boring bookworm who constantly bites her lips and has orgasms on demand.  Christian is a super hot billionaire at 27 who finds boring spineless bookworms super hot.<br /><br />And there's the plot.  No more to be said, or read.

B003YHSE7W|5.0|This was a Father's Day gift for my dad. Item was in great condition, as described, shipped fast and arrived in just a few days...much earlier than the estimated delivery date!! Very happy with purchase and dad loved the movie!! :)
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Boring and derivative. Thank goodness it was short. If you're a fan, borrow it from a library instead of wasting hard earned cash.
B009VL28W2|5.0|This was a great concert to watch.....having it on Blu-Ray is nice....the quality was great!! My kids like Metallica too so they enjoy watching/listening to the songs I let them listen to!! :P

0800141660|5.0|My grandmother still owns a lot of VHS tapes so little by little we are swapping out for DVD's.....she loves this movie and was very happy when it arrived as quick as it did!! Thanks so much!! :)
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|If you liked Iron Man, Thor, or the Hulk you'll like this too. And what's not to like about Scarlet Johansen?
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This was a Father's Day gift for my dad....he had seen the movie on tv and loved it so I decided to buy it for him!! Arrived a little late but by no fault of the seller....the post office lost the package but we eventually tracked it down!! He was very surprised to get this as a gift!! :)
0062255657|5.0|It has been a long time since I've been swept into a story... a long time since I've felt that sadness when turning a page and seeing the words \\"Epilogue\\".  This book brought both.<br /><br />A wonderfully written tale touching on themes less of magic and more on the Old Ways.  Three women bound together in this world as family but in another as One, each a part making a whole.  Layers of reality that converge to a doorway when on the women's farm... told from the eyes of a 7 year boy who is brought to the Truth when a man living in his home decides to take himself out of the world.  My only complaint was that it was too short.  I would have loved if Gaiman would have expanded some more on his different layers and the creatures that live within them... a few more adventures would have been lovely.<br /><br />At the end, as I turned the last page, I was left with this thought... Is this a fairy tale?  Or is it closer to the truth than we know?  I suppose I just don't remember.  We give up a lot, when we come here.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works perfect! I appreciate it being sent to me for free!  Hopefully this one won't fray like the other one.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Movie was supposed to come out last year, but delayed, supposedly to change the story; perhaps to create new story lines to create more sequels?  Not worth it.  It seems only the marketing was changed to be better, as the story and action really did not do anything to make the movie anywhere engaging even for viewing at home.  I know the movie is supposed to be an action fluff piece, but it does not have to be this...nothing.<br /><br />After hearing some stories about actor B.W. refusing to play in Expendables 3, they are probably better off.  He is now B.W. playing himself, and not a scripted movie character .
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Pretty Good and dependable alarm clock.  Just set it and it has always went off the time I set it for.  I
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The story is very similar to other post Apocalyptic Earth movies, but it did strive to be a litter different in the plot.  A little hard to follow through the watching, but I liked it better after finishing, and discussion with family.  Worked okay for a at-home Sci-fi/Action at-home-viewing movie.
B009AMALLM|5.0|the movie shipped to me very fast and i was very surprised.<br /><br />i only got it because i have 1-3, and i wanted to complete the series as much as possible, until the next one comes out.  it is a good movie, but the ending threw me off a bit.
140006922X|5.0|This has been a good read and I learned so much about the context in which Jesus lived so long ago. There is great care to describe the situation in the Palestine area and how the Romans were administering it. The Roman perspective is an important one.<br /><br />Coverage begins well before Jesus' birth right up until a couple of centuries after. There were numerous big changes taking place, often extremely violent ones. The cast of personages followed in detail is broad. The historical Jesus is a prime focus yet not a dominant actor in the book. There's no particular thesis being advanced.<br /><br />Overall it is very readable and I came away with a cohesive understanding that I was lacking beforehand.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Spell binding.  King is a genius at moving characters through episodes with interesting twists and turns.  He could have finished events in a more timely manner.  The last hundred or so pages seemed to drag. Overall, a good story .
B007D2XSW0|4.0|so for I have used on couple of pictures and I am pleased with the results. I would recommend this application
0385523394|5.0|I purchased and read this book in advance of viewing the Netflix series it inspired. (Always read the book first!) It was riveting! I read it from start-to-finish in the course of a weekend. As a woman with a similar background to the memoirist's, I was immediately drawn in to her world and experiences. Her reflections were even-handed and informed. She uses her story to give a voice to the experiences women of all backgrounds have in the prison system and point toward flaws in federal drug policy. Worth reading!
B008RNYNDM|4.0|A WAY OUT,OVER THE TOP MOVIE,KEN RUSSELL HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF THIS TIME,I SAW THIS IN THE THEATER BACK IN 1976 AND IT BLEW MY MIND,IT'S STILL CRAZY TODAY.LOTS OF NUDITY,MUSIC AND CRAZY IDEAS,ROGER DALTREY DOES OK IN THE TITLE ROLE AND GETS A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM HIS SUPPORTING CAST.PAUL NICHOLAS CRAZY SCENES INCLUDING A TURN AS HITLER,RINGO STARR PLAYS THE POPE AND RICK WAKEMAN PLAYS THOR,SO THAT SHOULD CLUE YOU IN TO THE WILD AND CRAZY MOVIE THIS IS.THE CAMERA WORK IS GREAT AND A SCENE WITH NUDE BLONDES DANCING AROUND A CERTAIN MALE PART WILL GET YOUR ATTENTION.SO KICK BACK AND ENJOY THIS ZANY FILM.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game does a great job of mixing humor and every D&amp;D players dream.  This is what mobile RPG apps should shot for.  A must buy for any D&amp;D player!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Historically accurate; however, my one issue is (and I am not a prude) the constant/overdone explicit sexual episodes.  Repeatedly!!  I do not need this overdose in a historical novel.  But, the book, as did Vol 1, kept me glued to my Kindle!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a great read for anyone that geeks out on anything from the 80's 90's or 00's.  A must read for any mega geeks out there.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I bought this to help me with a crafts project utilizing beer bottles.  It does what it says, but follow directions and be patient.  It takes some hand eye coordination to set up the jig, but after that it makes a good score.  I would practice for a while on stuff you don't mind losing, because it takes a light hand.  This product will definitely help me make my amazing rustic, beer bottle bottom accented  water fountain.
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|Pretty cool game,  instead of shooting at an AI copter you have targets go shoot at and obstacle courses to fly.  Sometimes you will have to chase cars and bomb them or land on a moving target. It gets harder as you proceed through the game levels.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I first watched this when they were promoting cable subscribers HBO which at the time I didn't have. I watched one episode and was hooked. The characters are crazy and I love it. I have my mom hooked on it.  The only thing is if you are offended by a lot of sex scenes this series is not for you because there is a lot of it.  I do recommend this

B003NS2T9G|5.0|A great series from start to finish.  The cast is superb, and the stories are entertaining.  Highly recommended.  Looking orward to the next season.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I am drawn to stories about attorneys in general but this show seriously has it all...........twists and turns, good screenwriting, intertwining story line.  Likely the best series I have ever watched.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I bought this album because I wanted a copy of &#34;Red Hands,&#34; but I have to say I pretty much love every track on here.  It's a melodic, folksy kind of music and I love that I can listen to it with my kids in the car because there is no profanity to speak of.  My two year old likes to sing along.

B000005HFH|5.0|I have always like the unique singing of Chet Baker, along with his trumpet and piano musical talents. Sadly to say, it was not until recently that I acquired a remastered cd of the best songs by Chet Baker.  He was one of the Icons in the Jazz world that never seemed to receive all his justly honored recognition for all his musical talents. The remastering of this cd from original analog tapes was marvelously produced.  Even though it is not the time honored complete digital cd, the listener gets to fully enjoy the crisp uncluttered vocals made famous by Chet Baker. I guarantee that if you only wish to buy one cd by Chet Baker, you should consider making this your primary choice.<br />  Matter of fact, I recently purchased a new cd released in 2013 by famous Brazilian singer Elaine Elias titled, \\" A Tribute To Chet Baker.\\"  She performs many songs made famous by Chet Baker. But getting back to this Chet Baker cd, in retrospect it is a simplistic performance without all the synthesizers and gimmicks present in many of the jazz markets new releases. To sum it all up: this cd is a jazz listener's dream come true.  Enjoy, and you will not be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Cute little guys but it always leads to more purchasing. It can't be reset  to a beginning level for starting over.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|A wonderful inspirational story. Very funny, and superbly acted by Omar Sy and Françoise Cluzet. I would recommend it to everyone.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The product is always locked in for a total run of solitare. I would like to be able to have an isolated version that has a total reset.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love the Amazon MP3. It is quick, easy, and fast. Listen to it daily. Keeps all my favorite music handy.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|This DVD has something for everyone, all music tastes. It's a classic and one I've recommended to any and all types of music freaks.  I play bluegrass, but love other fabulous music and this guy has it.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I was in a department store and heard music the store was playing that I liked but had never heard, no problem, hit shazam, and had it instantly. I just love this app. Use it all the time.
B00BEIYH6U|3.0|The first \\"Kick-Ass\\" had this proper balance of comedy, drama, and action that made it incredibly entertaining. Even Nicolas Cage had a strong performance in the film. Maybe it's the absence of stars like Cage and Mark Strong and that director Matthew Vaughn was replaced with Jeff Wadlow for the sequel that cause \\"Kick-Ass 2\\" to be a lesser film in comparison to the original or that the writing just doesn't cut it at all.<br /><br />While Jim Carrey publicly stated that the violence in \\"Kick-Ass 2\\" was too severe for him to promote, Colonel Stars and Stripes is the best part of the film. The character will have you wishing that the role was a bit bigger than it is, but the accent Carrey uses along with the character's brief background, fantastic dialogue, and quick switch into his hyperviolent mode makes Colonel Stars and Stripes the most memorable character of the film. The Colonel's dog Eisenhower is a very close second.<br /><br />Donald Faison is also quite amusing despite only having a very small role and most of Hit-Girl's action sequences are as awesome as ever. Christopher Mintz-Plasse has his moments while John Leguizamo actually brings shades of compassion as Chris D'Amico's bodyguard Javier. The scene involving Mother Russia (Olga Kurkulina) putting her $50,000 a week to good use is great because it's so ridiculous.<br /><br />Everything else surrounding the film either leaves you feeling very mixed about the film or leaves you disliking what you just witnessed. While Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Chloe Grace-Moretz give stronger performances than in comparison to \\"Kick-Ass,\\" the overall product is of inferior quality. The majority of the humor feels extremely juvenile. Hit-Girl was always foul-mouthed, but she also had heart. Now it all just seems so forced. Even as a fan of toilet humor, the \\"sick stick\\" is a bit much. Mindy and Dave go through exactly the same story arc, as well. This doesn't sound like much of an issue on the surface, but when you have to watch Mindy be gung-ho about being a superhero, then not want to be one, then want to be one again before Dave goes through exactly the same thing in the span of an hour and 40 minutes it all becomes a little redundant and tiresome.<br /><br />We know there's no chance Big Daddy is returning for this film, but do they have to point that out so often in this sequel? It honestly seems like you see Big Daddy's empty costume half a dozen times in the film. It's a basic thing to do for a superhero story, but showing it so often kind of makes it lose its meaning. The ending and after credits scene is massively predictable while the Hit-Girl sequence on top of the van has her being a bit more agile than she should be in a situation like that.

It honestly seems like you see Big Daddy's empty costume half a dozen times in the film. It's a basic thing to do for a superhero story, but showing it so often kind of makes it lose its meaning.

B005USZML4|4.0|I sail through these - love the language, love the ideas.  I hope more of them are written for us fans.
B00B2TG9F8|4.0|Beautiful artwork fills the pages of this book.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because you can't zoom in on the art very well on the Kindle version.  I have the hard bound book and it is a work of beauty.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too. It's been stuck in my head since I heard it the first time. Looking forward to the full Artpop album and the music video.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I almost gave up on you Walking Dead, but I kept hearing about how good this season was, and it is true.  I'm back on board.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|My book club read this, less than half really liked it, the rest felt it was just so-so and a few didn't like it much. I am with the so-so group. It is an easy read, but it drags on too long especially the second half. There is just so much one can say about how this kid sees the real world as a very strange place after being brought up in an 11x11 room. I usually like to feel that I have learned something, or have been taken to a place I have never been that interests me -- back in history, or another part of the world. Being held hostage is not a place I want to go. I really don't think reading this book made me a better or more educated person.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|Gentle music to sooth your soul is always good to let it wash over you and remember the movie. Nostalgia is a very potent emotion which can bring healing to the mind, body and soul as you remember good times.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in the far north-east and the weather changes quickly and often. This app has proven fairly accurate. If it says it is going to rain at 2 then you can bet that it will rain between 2 and 3. It is only wrong once in awhile. Also, my kids are scattered around the east coast and it lets me see the weather where they are and we are moving and I check the weather there to see what we are in for.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Tthe words of the song are a bit like a dark poem and the music stirs the soul to reflect on life and for a moment be drawn into a song of life and striving for bigger things
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|If you haven't drained your tear ducts in a while, this story will take care of that in no time.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It's an alright game to play, but the company should think about a way people can play as many game hands as they would like. I feel as if I shouldn't have to pay two coins every time I wanted to play the game. Then, you can not earn coins but doing a guess of two-four scratch off every 45 minutes. That's not enough, at least Facebook due a better job than that.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|Loved the Show and music included with Ringo and his All Starr Band.  Would recommend it for all Ringo and Beatle fans.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I became so interested in and connected with the characters. A few of the story lines were very captivating and I wanted to see what would happen to the characters. For awhile, I didn't want to put the book down. I began to lose some interest because there were too many characters and too many sub plots. I knew the author was tying it all together but it was a lot to keep track of--all the names and who was connected to whom and what age they were now.. This caused me to lose the feeling. He should have developed something stronger and deeper with some story lines rather than to create so many of them. Overall a good book, with messages of love, benevolence, loyalty and family. Not as actioned-packed as his first two books, and too long. I don't regret reading it though because it reminded me of what matters most in life.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|This was fun. My whole family enjoyed hunting for numbers and competing to see who could find them first. Wish there were more levels.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Well,I found this at Wal-Mart for $3.94 and figured\\"What the Heck\\"so it came home with me.It's a pretty desent flick.Lots of action,blood and sex but not for the kiddies.The blue dude rocks and strolls around naked with his blue dong in the wind.He's kind of a Smurf on steroids and the movie also has a few nice looking Babes as sexy superheros.Eat your heart out JLA and Avengers.....
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|Great quality that will last a long time! So much better than the cheap imitation cables from China. Better than Apple plus it's 9 feet
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It does not matter, what age you are. It's a movie for yourself or the family. Lots of fun. A very good movie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Bought this product because I saw the Fathom Events featuring him and this album.  Well worth the price (the event and the CD)
B000NYT1M6|5.0|We bought this truck for our son for Christmas. It is very nice with bright colors and looks very real. He enjoys playing with it. The bed of the truck lifts up and the doors open and close.
1416955070|5.0|Purchased this item based on the recommendation of someone I know - Well written, easy to follow and just generally love the premise and story
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Book moved right along, no real surprises , great book for the beach, I will probably read ore by the author
B006LSZECO|5.0|So full of surprises and very much something that could happen today. Maybe it has...fun book.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B0087EACJK|2.0|boring and repetitive, not very memorable or exciting. already uninstalled it after playing it once or twice. look elsewhere for a better game.
1440503257|5.0|The book looks brand new and is a must for any Harry Potter fan. It has so many recipes ranging from a twist on a classic to the famous foods you hear in the books. I love it! The pages have that uneven old look (it's meant to look that way) that I absolutely love! Gives it an extra magical old spell book kind of look. This one if a present for my sister and I plan on getting more for myself and other family members!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Oblivion, the first thought a lot of people had was that it was video game based. Or so most of the people who I knew, that had seen the trailer.<br /><br />Oblivion is visually stunning, with deep, enriching environments and beautiful shots. The soundtrack that accompanies the movie is memorable, and beautifully haunting.
0399255370|5.0|Drew Daywalt's book, The Day the Crayons Quit, was colorful, very cute and held the interest of all the children.  The ending is marvelous and made everyone smile.  This is one book that can be read over and over.  Linda Connor
0061743526|4.0|A great lesson in tolerance.  Also refreshing to look back to a time when children could &#34;roam&#34; the neighborhood for hours on end and parents didn't have to worry about their safety.  Of course, there was also the dark side of intolerance--
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman's writing.  He takes the ordinary and the supernatural and co-mingles them in an unique way.  I want a whole book about the Hempstocks though.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I watched the entire two discs in one sitting. I had read the book for a book club read and wanted a movie to watch after. This production did a good job all around and I felt that they were true to the novel.
B006M4F67A|3.0|This app has a lot going for it but there is nothing I can find that tells me how to unlock the next chests. Also I don't understand why there are only four layouts that I absolutely cannot get three stars on! I have won way more than three games of these 4 layouts but the third star NEVER LIGHTS UP! I thought that once you get all 3 stars lit up in each layout that that would unlock the next treasure chest, but I guess I will never know. Bad app programming. I was hoping that I had finally found the best mahjong game ever but I was sooo wrong!!!
159463176X|4.0|Hosseini is a wonderful author.  He tells a gripping story and this book doesn't disappoint.  The characters are well developed and their stories draw in the reader quickly.  This novel created unforgettable images in my mind.
B007KCG7MQ|3.0|This was a good CD.  I've always liked Walsh.  This one has some new Walsh stuff and some Eagles sounding stuff.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Rate is 5 it cool game minecraft it is the best game!<br />This game  check out all of the updated  are grat.
159463176X|5.0|I've read Hosseini&#34;s other 2 books and this one is by far the best.  This is a page turner.  Pick it up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is cool I like it a lot. Thanks. Subway surfer is so cool and fun. I play it  lot
0061122416|2.0|It wasn't a bad story, but I would not recommend it.  It dragged and was hard to understand.  I wouldn't spend my money on this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game with beautiful visuals and really fun to play over and over I wish they had more versions of this amazing game.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I found this to be a good movie. I enjoyed it. I rented from Amazon Instant Video. Everything worked flawlessly.
B000002ITW|5.0|This was my favorite album when it came out.  Southern Man is one I used to enjoy on headphones.  Great album!
B001FD5KJM|5.0|This is a great movie and Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect fit to play Iron Man. Iron Man 3 is not as good as all others but still good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok this game is getting more and more perfect every update and this update I want bad. One of my best friends got it on his iPod this morning. In the update, well I don't want to spoil it but it has something to do with chests.(;(;<br />Mojang please hurry to get it on kindle fire HD like..... NOW!!!!!!<br /><br />  Minecraft....Totally worth all the money I paid for it.<br /><br />  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!
B000WT7R6O|4.0|Funny, exciting and entertaining. The brotherly arguments and feud get old though and you definitely want it to stop by the third season, but that is a small annoyance. Read my review of Season 4 for more info but this is a good show. The Dean character is the comic relief and does an excellent job of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game when I buy it on 2012 it<br />was dumb but in 2013 it was amazing but I heard<br />author updates 7.2 and 7.3 and 7.3 is like the computer! I like the 7.3 update<br />you should get it 7.3 update.
B001G50SLE|4.0|This is a great show but I'm not currently up to date though other people say that it is still good. However I do know that once the show incorporated the Angels it pretty much had to stay at that level. I think they probably should have drawn out the lesser monsters for a few more seasons. I mean now that they have incorporated the Devil and God and Angels they have kind of locked themselves into it. They can't exactly start hunting the peon ghosts and monsters from the early seasons and there really isn't any higher to go beyond Angels/Demons/God/Devil level.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love, love pinterest! It's a great way to organize all those cool things you find on the internet. You can name your own boards, follow boards of friends or others with similar interests. I find myself spending hours collecting, researching and just enjoying the enormous collections of pins.
B001G50QCK|4.0|So there is a lot of cheesiness in this show but it is definitely worth watching. They incorporate a bunch of other DC characters in this show and is a great incarnation of Superman before he becomes Superman, but Clark will piss you off with his reluctant babyish personality especially in the early seasons. Also he's stupid and falls into everyone's trap, but that has always been Superman's true weakness, reluctance and the inability to think &#34;Hey, there might be kryptonite concealed in that led chamber.&#34; Anyway, it's a good Superman show so watch it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is really awesome if I say so myself. There's over 100 levels. It's one of the best ever made.
B0092SQ5EG|2.0|I may be too old for this film. Did find myself jumping ahead a lot rather than just quitting it,
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great cast.  Great direction.  Tons of fun from the first frame to the last!  Actions films are not my favorite genre, but this one is an exception.  Good writing.  Lots of plot twists.  You'll love it!  Then when you've finished watching it, go watch Red 2, which is even better!  Imagine that!  A sequel that's better than the first one!
B0073COMUW|3.0|I purchased these bulbs believing what the manufacturer said about \\"nice light\\".  They were to replace two CFL lights I had in my kitchen (they still worked, but just upgrading). The old lights put out a nice \\"normal\\" yellowish light, like an incandescent bulb.  That's what I expected out of these bulbs... but YUCK!  What a disgusting, harsh, brackish white light they emit. And, these bulbs only put out light on the tips! So if they are mounted horizontally in a ceiling fixture, the area directly under the fixture is DARKER than the SPOT LIGHT effect they emit onto the walls and cabinets!  Gross!  These bulbs are very bright (although not really as bright as a regular 60W bulb.... they are close) but they are not suitable for home use. Maybe great in a shop, garage, shed, where you don't really care about the ambiance.  So far I haven't found an LED bulb I like. Will keep looking though because I love the energy savings and long life.  But what good is that if you hate the light output?<br /><br />Update! I replaced these lights (the light output was so ugly I couldn't stand it) with G7 Power G7A19W10 800 Lumen 10-watt Omni-Directional LED Dimmable Light Bulb, A19, Warm White.  What a difference!  I will be moving these old bulbs out to the barn, and keeping the G7's in the kitchen.  I will also be buying a lot more G7's for the rest of the house. They seem to be a perfect incandescent replacement.<br /><br />To be fair, I wasn't educated when buying these bulbs. You have to look at the color temperature. 2700-3000 range is normal incandescent light.  These are rated 5000k, which is very harsh, blue-white. Not good for the home and hard on the eyes. Makes you look pale, pasty, and gray.<br />Thanks for reading.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Sweet story that includes three adorable orphan girls, three villains, a mad scientist and a whole bunch of minions.  Enjoy!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is by far my most favourite so ever.  Love that I can play it on my kindle.  The only thing that could make it better is if you could win a little bit more or that the bingo credits weren't so hard to get the higher up in the game you go
111846446X|4.0|If you can afford the $25 for the computer, you can afford to buy this small book to learn about your Computer.  If you don't buy it then shame on you.  It's cheap and you need it if you have the computer.
1452101248|5.0|interesting combinations and healthy ingredients make this book a welcome addition to the cooks library.<br />The  recipes are easy to follow and the photographs are beautiful.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|No issues with these, they worked great for my system.  Based on a 5.1 Surround Sound system, I did end up with more of these than needed.
B00785P2QC|2.0|It is very enjoyable to play when you control the city's future and if you screw up something it will still do you good
B00E8TVHBA|1.0|This is a really bad movie. Not Disney 's best. The actors are good, but the script is terrible. Also, the boys dancing on the beach look like wusses and dance like girls!!!
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|received in good condition.  pleased with purchase.  looking forward to many hours of pleasure.cd received as reported. thank you again. look forward to my next purchase.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|Too much swearing and while I like all the actors, the story itself was not very interesting.  I would not recommend this.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was such a great book if you read the series. Loved this book. I love the story and the action.
B0061S073A|1.0|kindle free time is the way to go, it is totally worth the money! This paled in comparison as far as freedom and control.
B009HEMF1M|4.0|Not gonna blow your mind with anything here, but definitely worth a rental, or even a purchase! Entertaining, humorous, not too heavy in any area. We liked it.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|A great follow up to heat wave, If you like Castle the tv show you'll love the books. While you're reading it you're imagining the tv characters. Fun read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game is very  addictive .every day i wake and play for a long while  and add new stuff to my world. like  go mining and more stuff there is unlimited kind of things to do in  minecraft.
B00BP0O7QW|3.0|There were a few price tag stickers on the front and back covers.<br />It took a bit to scrape them off and wipe the excess off but over all, it looks to be in good condition.
030745455X|4.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ADULTS WHO CAN OVELOOK THE &#34;IN YOUR FACE&#34; SEX AND  WHO DO NOT MIND AN OTHERWISE EXCELLENT BOOK FULL OF PERVERSION.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|i orderd the album and fell in love. this is her best album yet.<br />it's got different songs styles and i love the music as well the massages they're bringing!<br />my favorite songs:<br />Two Pieces<br />Neon Lights<br />Something That We're Not<br />In Case<br />Really Don't Care<br />Made In The USA<br />Fire Starter<br />more than half the songs, and the rest are also great.<br />i love her and deeply recomend you to buy this cd :)
0307454568|4.0|THE BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT WERE IT NOT FOR THE BLATANT SEX. ALSO, THE PLOT WAS TOO INVOLVED FOR MY COMFORT.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I was hoping this wasn't actually the final show.  I'll be wondering what happened to Merlin and Arthur in the future.
B0039OC64M|5.0|I first watched this during the year 1984, and found it incredibly depressing. I have since watched it twice, this last time after having recently re-read Orwell's novel of the same name. It is hauntingly beautiful, but made all the more powerful by it being Sir Richard Burton's final film.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love this series from the beginning.  Great show!  I like the young Merlin and Arthur.  Fun show to watch.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Giving this book 2 stars is more than it really deserves.  i have always enjoyed books by DeMille and the premise of this one sounded good as well but this book turned out to be one of the most boring books I've ever waded through.  On top of the boredom factor, the main character, John Corey, has become a real annoyance rather than the funny, interesting character that he once was.  Too much of a formerly good thing I guess.  I am going to be very leery before purchasing another book by this author.  Sometimes you just carry on too long living off your reputation.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app for relaxation - my dog loves the peaceful sounds falls asleep to them nightly.  I like how you can make your own series of sounds.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini does not disappoint.  His third novel keeps you turning the pages just as his other 2.  Love the history mixed with present day.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Out of the trilogy the last book was my least favorite.  It was the least believable and I did not like the ending. It had to be read to finish off the series and I am glad I read it however.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting game, makes you think.... somewhat like &quot;memory&quot; ... really fun and my children like to help, they like to be &quot;Smarter&quot; then mama...
B002MQYOFW|4.0|At first I was not sure I liked the book because of the subject matter.;  suffering, terror, children, starvation, games that were played by those who could.  But I did get hooked once I got past the shock of it all and I loved the series.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|like it cuz good movie n' I have a ps3 for the BD. n' bought others that were awesome too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It held my attention from beginning to end.  I loved it.  I Wish it were longer. I think it was the best of the trilogy.
B003UESJHE|5.0|like it cuz good movie n' I have a ps3 for the BD. n' bought others that were awesome too.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I ordered and paid but cannot find it on any of my electronics.  Maybe it is operator error but maybe not
B000F9RB8K|5.0|like it cuz good movie n' I have a ps3 for the BD. n' bought others that were awesome too.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|overall good movie great effect, scenery are very beautiful, some of the effect are a little far fetch,  worth buying
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved the book more than the movie because it was more detailed.  I love this fresh vampire perspective of life.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|Why is this so bad let me make people admins so my pages get popular seriously it isn't that hard to do
B008JFUO36|3.0|Having watched this and past Cruise SciFi, I now know why he is so good in these way out there's, how could a Scientologist not stray far from the oak tree. Cruise is a consumate actor  when he develops himself as himself, not a disciple, and pours himself into these fantasies. How the director could have chosen another for this mind bender, would have been disaster.  This is an exceptionally good film second only to the remake of War of the Worlds.  One wonders how Cruse would have fared without RLH perhaps a star ranking with Woods and Gorcey.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Have been using this dictionary for years. It is a good source! Would recommend this to anyone who needs a dictionary .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An awesome addition to our library. Cannot wait for season 4! Hope it goes to season 10!  Longlive the Brits
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I honestly do enjoy The Goodwife. It's a good show & I love a strong female character. I just find that while there is some story to it, each episode follows the same predictable formula. I do watch The Goodwife & I enjoy it but it bores me after a couple of episodes.
0307341550|2.0|The story itself is interesting but it is very heavy-handed that it does not provide readers the joy of putting pieces together on their own at the end, lingering in readers' mind for a bit. The author explains too much of obvious events that don't need to be articulated further and that makes it very easy to guess the killer from early on. This can be a good book for flight.
B00A0T0NWQ|3.0|\\"1941\\" should be seen by any fans of Belushi and Ackroyd, et al. The whole is less than the sum of its stars parts.  So I have the DVD but have not watched it.  I will  skim though it shortly. I saw \\"1941\\" during the original run, once. The dvd age came aobut and I only remembered the film was 'big', it had the right names and I should have it.  Otherwise nowadays absorbed by the web while radio is on in the background means a pile of discs remain unwatched.<br /><br />For some \\"1941\\" reviewers, the ensemble of 'Mad Mad World' is invoked. Yes that is apt - for me as the sub captain [Mitamura/ Mifune] invoked the grail of \\"Hollywood\\" as fervently as the protagonists of \\"Mad, Mad, Mad World\\" did of the \\"Big W\\"! But \\"Mad World\\" is truly a treasure and \\"1941\\" is not.<br /><br />\\"1941\\"only came to mind tonight as I saw a cable program regarding aliens and such that was chiefly about the Feb. 1942 \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\".  An epic, astounding event.  \\"1941\\" was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. What did they and Spielberg know of it?  I thought of the movie as I watched tv and was confused at first that it was..no not \\"1942\\", it's \\"1941\\".  The movie's events must be taken to occur sometime during approx. 3 weeks from Dec. 8 and Dec. 31 1941!<br /><br />Instead of taking something small and inflating it into near comedic bloat [such as shame with the stars they had]...imagine what could have been if it was \\"1942\\" set in the frenzy of incorporating what was an actual blackout of LA, fighters scrambled to chase a UFO-like object and over a thou' shells fired, all ineffective [and the thing disappears after all], as this very Japanese sub comes a la \\"1941\\" in a sorry effort to invade. Take it from there...that's my pitch.
0525953728|5.0|Nicely written, easy read and makes you blood pump!  God bless our troops!  It really gives you an inside look into the life of a soldier on top of the killing of Osama
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|Fun to play recommend for rainy days or if your bored I personally like to play when the kids are asleep
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|What can I say, they get better and better each time!  Love the remakes that they do and all of the their songs as well!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought the actual cd and it is great.  I love listening to Lindsey Stirling and now have my own cd.  Great product.  Came just as the seller stated.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Phil is outstanding on this album! Not Pantera so if that's what you are looking for you will not get it.  Hard, heavy dirty and mean!
B00006JSS8|5.0|My grandfather LOVED Stevie Wonder and I purchased this collection and it brought back memories.<br /><br />This cd is priceless<br /><br />Thanks
B00BMEF6IO|3.0|Heard a few songs and thought Id give it a shot, a bit whiny for my standards, I'd listen to a few tracks and judge for yourself.
0812416503|3.0|The beginning of the book was just awful and I didn't want to continue reading, but if you keep going it gets a little better towards the middle and end. Needs a better hook
B005K17RU0|2.0|as compared to others it is not accurate all the time. not enough info is presented that I would like.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Had this for the iPod originally, and when I got my kindle fire I wanted to transfer over some of those games, I was happy to seen this was  one I could.  Enjoy playing this when I have just a few minutes to kill or when I can really put some focus into it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Thanks for no nasty surprises! I am delighted with the condition of my new refurbished Kindle, and am enjoying learning how useful it is at my breakfast table.
0486278077|5.0|My daughter needed this for her high school summer reading.  The book is in incredible shape! Thanks for a great deal!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I could never get the app to open once it downloaded to my kindle. Looked like it could've been a great game.
B006N57PXG|5.0|This book is full of adventure and suspense. Bartimaeus is a witty spirit from the other place that is full to the brim with the wisdom and cocky attitude that comes from thousands of years of being in the company of us lowly and fragile humans. A super AWESOME read!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well written.  Held my interest.  I always have trouble keeping track of characters with this author = there are so many of them.  Perhaps it is because of the Afghan names.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is wonderful! As so far there haven't been any glitches. Although I only graded it as a four star because they have friend requests of people I am not even aware of! If you want to get this app be warned about how addicting this game can be to people!!! That is all, rather than that it is beyond perfect
B002MG2ATY|4.0|Not a bad movie, a little long but very intreging. So I would definitely recommend this movie to a friend!
B001NN413K|1.0|dvd did not work.  It was a bithday present for my granddaughter.  Very disapointed! will not order out of the country and just stick with Amazon products only.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My wife, the one who mocked my super hero fanaticism, loved this movie and wanted to join the team. Maybe it was due to seeing Thor?!
B0000VCZKM|4.0|My grand daughter loved it.  She watches it 1-2 x daily.  I will look for more great old movies. Thank you
034580404X|4.0|Very good.  I actually bought these books for a gift.  I had read them earlier and was very surprised at the ending.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Fun writing style, easily accessible, and brings yellow butterflies out of the woodwork. Really. Reinforces a lot of teaching already out there, and makes it pretty stone axe simple to understand.
B0052U6J9Y|4.0|Great shoe, this is actually my second pair.  That being said the tread is pretty aggressive, and wouldn't recommend it for groomed trail running, only because I believe the tread contributes to a bit of inflexibility.  The new models with much more modest tread appear and feel much more flexible and would seem more nimble over all with less weight.  The material used for the upper on these is much better for cooler or inclement weather as they are more resistant to water, sand, dirt and debris but still breathe fairly well.
B00004YX39|5.0|Where excess is in fashion and Hollywood cowboys run amok. Country music this isn't, though they probably play it in the country of Bolivia. Maybe among the Panama upper crust too. It just sounds expensive. It should, as at the time of its release it was the most expensive album ever made.<br /><br />I used to think this album was boring. It took Aja and drained the rock out of it. The truth was, I just was not old enough to respect it. It was written by and for people much older than me. Now it is hard to find fault in it. If Aja is rock music's most sophisticated album, then this must be its smoothest, as class oozes from its grooves. The zany booklet is a must read. These guys are witty nuts. \\"Gaucho\\" may not be as great as \\"Aja\\" or \\"Katy\\", but it is right up there, and as slick as any you will find.<br /><br />So slick, this album is practically a concept in idea. The winds are named Santa Ana, after a third world man. The Gaucho, a derelict from across the border who wanders the streets, is also a third world man. The intoxicants, Cuervo and Columbian are also third world. While `Glamour Profession' brings us Barbados and Bogata, more third world connections. The lyrics on this album have far outgrown the simple ones from their first albums. These words weave a story.<br /><br />\\"It's everything they say, The end of a perfect day, Distant lights from across the bay \\".<br />`Babylon Sisters'. Background singers are at the fore front as the `Sisters' sing it as if they were skipping along like a cool breeze. For me this is easily the best song on the album and one of the best they have ever done. This song shifts up and down the west coast, between LA and San Francisco with a snatch of Tijuana thrown in for good measure.  \\"So fine, so young, cotton candy\\". Once again, the Dan seem to be hung up on jailbait.<br /><br />\\"The Cuervo Gold, The fine Colombian\\"<br />`Hey Nineteen'. He calls her by her age. Like `Throw Back' and `Sisters', this is another jailbait song, only this one deals more with aging. This is the one song here I never cared for, not being a big fan of Aretha Franklin, and being the albums hit single, Gaucho's advertising did not pay off for me. It would take me a quarter of a century to relate to this album. Now I don't mind this song. It is casual and it makes me want to drink. I guess I have mellowed. Aged, as it were.<br /><br />\\"Jive Miguel, He's in from Bogota\\"<br />`Glamour Profession'. If the first two songs describe a day in time, this one is a whole week. This tale is told from the point of view of the guy who makes all the connections, and he tells the story like he is the star of the show, as nothing could happen without him as the right hand man. The guy they call Hoops has enough green to get private deliveries, yet he overdoses on Brut? And the car, a Chrysler? Really? Is that so no one notices him? What's wrong with a Countach? This small detail tells me we might be talking about an actual event. The last minute is a guitar solo supported by horns, framing the fade out scene of our cowboys riding off into the sunset. Crime does pay, for a while anyway.<br /><br />\\"Why is he standing, In your spangled leather poncho?\\"<br />`Gaucho'. This bodacious cowboy may be `Doctor Wu's' biggest rival for the title of Steely Dan's Most Beautiful Song. There are some who say this gaucho is simply a gay lover of a business associate ruining a drug deal. But this gaucho is not gay. The very fact that he is wearing \\"your\\" clothes proves that he is not. The \\"your\\" is a she, and the only \\"she\\" at play here is the story tellers wife. We know this because he mentions marriage. His comment about being married makes this a hetro conflict. The gaucho may be bi, but he is still a rival for his wife's affections, which she clearly shows toward him. Wives' cost a lot of money and divorce is the \\"expensive\\" kiss off he mentions here. No need to involve drugs. The clothes are only odd because they are her clothes. If a guywas wearing another guys clothes no one would care or notice. It only becomes a big deal when the guy is wearing woman's clothing, specifically his wife's clothing, which he recognizes. It is not the dress code in the posh Custerdome we are talking about here, it is that a members wife has brought in an outsider.<br /><br />\\"Tonight when I chase the dragon, The water will change to cherry wine\\"<br />`Time Out if Mind' is the tune that many a rocker will tell you is where the Dan crossed the line into elevator music. It is the most pop of all the tunes here and it lacks the inventiveness that the others share. Very pristine for a Steely Dan song about heroin. I would have expected something much sleazier.<br /><br />\\"I struck a match against the door, Of Anthony's Bar and Grill\\"<br />`My Rival'. Now he's got detectives on the case. This is serious. He's going to bring down this other man, the old guy with the scar. Our storyteller is standing in the rain outside the bar, watching his house. \\"The milk truck eased into my space, Somebody screamed somewhere\\" The truck is in his spot, driven by his wife's lover. It has pulled into HIS space, be it a parking space or his wife's lap. It is her who screamed, in delight of course. Unlike what some may say, the \\"tiny hand\\" does not refer to a child, only that she was childlike and innocent when he met her. And what is that sound we hear in the background 30 seconds in?<br /><br />\\"When he's crying out, I just sing that Ghana Rondo, E l'era del terzo mondo\\"<br />`Third World Man'. It's a Dirty War in Argentina and scary little kids rule the sidewalk. And if \\"Smokey Sundays\\" are barbeques in suburbia, it seems that our protagonist may have lost his, for now he himself has become a third world man, one prone to violence and madness, barricading himself into his suburban home. Maybe his wife finally drove him over the edge. Or could this be about his child in the sandbox, a child that was fathered by his rival, the Gaucho? With Steely Dan you never know. What we do know is that with 1 minute 20 left, the song begins to wind down. The long fade out of this last song would last for 20 years, until the Dan made \\"Two Against Nature\\". That fade ends with two odd guitar notes, one for each of our boys. A subliminal message that all is not that perfect in their western world?<br /><br />4.8 starswas wearing another guys clothes no one would care or notice.

B005HI4LLY|5.0|This is such a well written and acted movie. A great twist on the hillbilly vs college kids horror classic. Very funny. Dialogue is very witty, but understated.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is an awesome game where you create a park on magical floating islands. You improve your park by getting new dragons, buying decorations, and maybe even summoning a new island! The one annoying part is that it takes time to do things, but that is easy to get over. I would definitely recommend this to any first-time tablet or smartphone owners.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is the original Frank Oz directed, British version and is hilarious. A lot of fun to watch. Way better than the remake version.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|My daughter and I both love playing this! She's 6 yrs old, so it helps her think fast on the numbers & strategize her moves to get the best possible points. :)
0571238343|5.0|This is a must for animators or anyone interested in learning how to do animation. Very helpful tips and guides.

B004I1K2NW|5.0|This is great fun and surprisingly not a very well known movie, but has a stellar cast and is a Peter Jackson film. This can be watched over and over again and is very entertaining.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Pleasantly surprise by this pick, I did not really know much of Willie music I thoroughly enjoyed this mix. Thanks
B003Y5H542|5.0|Fun Movie. This was a great and entertaining video, featuring Johnny Depp. This is really fun for the whole family.
B005USZYDU|3.0|I like this book very cleaved looking at the legal system from a adolescents point of view.  Good character interaction
B001EBWING|4.0|Gallantry and chivalry in a difficult era - plus a sincerity.  The characters do a wonderful job in promoting their worth.
B0041VT6HW|3.0|Recommended by a male friend of mine.  He thought I might like it because it has actors in it that I like.  It was fun to watch on a Saturday afternoon.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|My husband and I both watched this movie together and we both enjoyed it very much.  It took some unexpected twists.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Purchased because my son and grandson love this game I have not perfected it as of yet great game for the price.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game keeps me entertained for hours. And since I refuse to use real money on games it takes a while to build stuff up which keeps me playing..
B008Q0D32S|4.0|I liked it when I saw at the movies years ago with my now husband of 37 years.  It brought back the thrill of then popular spaghetti westerns.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|i love this music. it is exciting and fun. i recommend this music for everyone. it has a lot of good tracks.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Really like the series and the cast interaction.  Love Neal and Mozzie's good guy/bad guy personas and Peter always doing what is right and being someone you can count on no matter what.  Discovered it after it had been on TV for two years, but have caught up by purchasing all the past seasons on DVD.  Only wish the people that make series like this on DVD would be faster in getting them out.  I'm currently waiting on Season 4 of White Collar pretty impatiently and may be forced to get it off ITunes.
0525478817|4.0|This book is wonderful from start to finish.  One of those books that you don't want to end.  The author has a very creative and sharp witted sense of humor that leaves the reader wanting more.  The chemistry between the two main characters begins in such an innocent way, and then grows into a deep friendship that sparks new life in each of them.  The love they have for one another is pure and unconditional.  Enjoy this wonderful book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A definite must have. It's a great way to have fun, without having a long game to deal with. The levels are fun and are getting harder, but still fun to play.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Gotta love tony stark. Even when he is being awful to everyone. Great plot and beautiful graphics!  I would definitely recommend this for comic and action lovers.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this app was amazing! untilnit started saying update avalible. now it takes me to the app store every time and I cant play it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|watched it with my niece and nephew, not only did they have a lot of fun but so did I. great movie!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Who doesn't love Michael Buble?!!!  I have all of his CD's and love to listen to them.  Makes me happy.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Suspenseful film. Superb acting by all actors. It was a dark movie with a few small twists and turns. But love Matthew McConaughey as a superb actor. It holds your interest, but tends to be a little slow sometimes.
B000HL09MG|5.0|It is a masterpiece! When I first watch it I was 20 years old. Still, whenever I watch it I learn new things. It's really a must see for all movie lovers!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I highly recommend this film. It is long, but so engrossing that you do not notice the length of time. I liked it because it shows raw human emotion in a volatile time in history. I had a friend over who had never seen this film. She remarked on how she could not believe she missed this movie when it came out. True Classic!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun. One of the best games I have played in sometime. I would be the one who bought this game first if it came out in gamestop
B00632HWOG|4.0|Seems to work well, so far no trouble. Only used a few times so far, but like what i see thus far.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was looking high and low for a mouse to affix to my gaming laptop which wasn't so budget. It works great and even came with these little weight things that you can use to make the mouse heavier for some reason. I added all of them and I think that alone has added at least +7 skill to my dexterity. Thanks for the great product Anker
B001FW58D6|4.0|A great show. Highly entertaining if you're interested in scientific explanations for supernatural occurrences. Very well done with acting and story lines and such.<br /><br />I recommend for fans of science fiction and supernatural fiction.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use and easy to sync devices. What else do you want? I like this because lists are useful for a guy like me.
B003U4UNUU|4.0|The final season is a little disappointing, but yet a bit fulfilling, too. I thought about the ending of this show for a very long time after watching it. I enjoyed the first three seasons infinitely more than the second three, but the ending is a bit epic, I suppose. Not all questions are answered, but the show does come to a conclusion, though that conclusion is a bit vague.<br /><br />I only recommend to fans of the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The escape game is challenging.  Once you start it will be hard to stop. You will be determined to find all the hidden clues.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|This is definitely one of the best shows I've ever seen! (To answer the question of why there's so little of it, Fox is dumb and aired it out of order so that it was confusing, etc.) Western plus science fiction - Who would have ever thought that would be a good combo? Anyway, this is a show that should have gone on for many seasons.<br /><br />With a few bits of humor, an interesting story line and intriguing plot, honest and likable characters, great acting and special effects, this show lacks nothing, only the seasons it should have definitely had a chance to air.<br /><br />This is a 5-star show and I can't wait to watch the movie now!<br /><br />I highly recommend to all who like science fiction, westerns, and comedy.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I found this book thought provoking, I am not sure that I believe the title to be the best synopsis of this work, but the read is truly edifying.<br /><br />I should say I am a believer that Jesus was the Messiah ( definitions might differ ), and if your faith is thin, you might find this a challenging book to read, but if you can find your way through, I think you will be stronger for it.  I have never been a big fan of St. Paul's extreme view points, however I give credit to St. Paul for all he did in spreading the Word.  St. Paul had an insight to the teachings of Jesus that some of the other more orthodox seemed reluctant to embrace, but Paul seems to have made a wrong turn somewhere and he became a corrupting influence, and the problem is that Paul's writings have deeply shaped the Christian doctrine today, and this has caused some problems.<br /><br />Jesus was a man that was anointed to bring the Word of GOD, and He did just that.  I do not feel Jesus was in fact GOD, I guess that is something I never found necessary to believe to accept the Word of GOD.  I am a devoted disciple of Jesus, and this work has not diminished Jesus in my conception of Him as the Messiah, but it is true, it is not all together flattering to the Church and some of the depictions of what we call Christian dogma.<br /><br />My favorite description of Jesus is the Lamb of GOD, but I know Jesus preferred to be called \\"Teacher\\".<br /><br />I also believe this book made some really profound statements that seem to just go unemphasized, and to think \\"Zealot\\" is the best description wow, I could not disagree more, this book unearths the amalgamation of how the Bible was constructed, it lays bare some startling facts or evidence that looks to call into question some of the decisions in what we call today the Bible.<br /><br />Why I question \\"Zealot\\", Jesus was never a violent man, never did He ever sanction or commit violence, the suggestion was that he was of the same ilk as those around Him, but this misses the most profound of differences.  Jesus was a spiritual warrior, a man who, championed the heart and soul over the physical world.<br /><br />I find the most enduring profoundly wise statement \\"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to GOD what is GOD's\\" never has a more profound statement been uttered, this speaks to a man who was no common person as his upbringing might have suggested. I could go on, but I will let you draw your own conclusions from the read.<br /><br />As they say... the truth shall set you free... I believe this to be an honest work, it may not make all the correct conclusions, I disagree on some statements, but still I found it closer to the real truth of Jesus.<br /><br />GOD bless you, and may the Holy Spirit guide you.
B003U53JVE|5.0|This is the best season of the whole series in my opinion, though I'm not sure you could understand what's happening unless you've seen the first two seasons. If you only ever watch one episode of this show, watch \\"Expose\\" (episode 14 of season 3) - it is by far my favorite (Oh, the horror!).<br /><br />The character development of this show is unprecedented. This show is about the characters, and how you never really know someone, really. Everyone has a little mystery about them, and everyone makes mistakes. Everyone has their own interests and is willing to sacrifice different amounts of things to accomplish their personal means.<br /><br />This is a great, albeit addicting, show. It's very well done all throughout, though this is the most revealing, exciting, and mysterious season of all.<br /><br />I highly recommend for fans of dramatic intrigue and horror.
B009P5K4HK|5.0|I am a huge Amy Winehouse fan. This live concert is excellent. I wish she was still alive so we could look forward to more of her music.
B003U4XX52|4.0|*Note: This review may contain spoilers.*<br /><br />The storyline begins to get muddled. Up until season three, we were learning about the characters' pasts and such, and after season 3, it makes sense that the show flashes forward to the characters' futures or whatever. But it's unclear whether the scenes are actually true - I mean, it makes you think: do they get off the island, do they just die and imagine they got off the island when they actually never did, or have they been dead since season one and the island was always a kind of purgatory?<br /><br />Anyway, if I were to re-watch this series, I'd not re-watch the last few seasons. There are too many questions that inevitably go unanswered. The longer the show goes, the more open it is to individual interpretations. There are too many possible answers for very few questions.<br /><br />I only recommend to fans of the series.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|Some episodes are better than others.  Sometimes the storyline is just toooooooo farfetched to capture your imagination.  Others, however, keep you watching not only that episode, but get you to proceed on to the next.  I'm thinking that by the time you get to Season 2, the series will either be REALLY GOOD and have you captured OR the novelty will have worn off and it will be REALLY BORING.....time will tell.
B003U4ZTWC|4.0|\\"The Beginning of the End\\" is a fitting title for the first episode, since this season is when the show starts going downhill. If I were to re-watch this series for pleasure, I would stop with season three. Season three was the peak, the best, and from there on, this series loses momentum and intrigue.<br /><br />This show is still very well done, but once you know what all happens, there's no reason to watch it, in my opinion.<br /><br />I recommend for fans of the first three seasons.
B00CX7TOOG|1.0|Wasn't this premise already filmed with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro (in a much better version) several years ago?
B0044CG71G|4.0|This show is definitely bizarre, but grounded in seem-less science. This season is intense. I highly recommend for fans of science fiction.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Before my own thoughts, I've read some of the low-end reviews of folks upset because this is nothing like Oregon Trail. If you take the time to read the description, you'll see that it was not the developer's intent to make another Oregon Trail. Yes, this is a &quot;Farmville/Sims&quot; meets The Wild West. Its successes make it a very enjoyable settler game, yet its weaknesses seem to finally be ruining the game for me (in the mid-20 levels).<br /><br />There is so much to love about this game. Variety is the spice here: Many buildings with various purposes, decorations that provide building bonuses, many farm animals to choose from (gathering food from a dog still weirds me out, however). There is a lot of room to expand your town, and many gathering options - logging, harvesting gardens, hunting, mining. The mining piece gives a nice bonus, and logging in daily also gives increased rewards. The quests given are humorous, though I scratch my head at some. (Need lumber to drive out those bandits? Nothing gets rid of robbers like throwing cords of wood at them...) I do like the visiting other towns option, even though it doesn't feel all too central to the game.<br /><br />There are many improvements and weaknesses I see in Settler. As far as the visit a friend's town, I can't seem to load the list. (I do have  friends that play and enjoy as well.) I would like to see an exchange of goods option, ex. food for lumber. I'd like an option to trade with other friends/towns. You tend to run out of lumber fast when purchasing land is expensive. Also, why would you need food in order to create fire at the blacksmith? There tends to be  materials that should just cost gold rather than an exchange of other goods.<br /><br />Now to my two greatest peeves that have ruined this game for me: the medical part and the disaster part. I understand that the west was (in reality) a gruesome time in history; unsanitary, unruly, unsafe, with a lot of hardships. However, when hardships in a game is so great that it impedes the enjoyment of the game, it makes me want to quit playing. Why? In order to keep up with all the disasters (by mid-20 levels), you have to start purchasing items with real money to keep your town from turning into a disease-spewed wasteland.  Examples. Let me get back to the bandit situation. I have raiders in my town. Next to the sheriff who sits pretty on his country bumpkin - useless. Need a lot of lumber to get rid of the bandits, which is tough when the land you purchased is now barren of trees. Another, more annoying task: healing the sick. By the time you create all the supplies to help these unfortunate people, you end up with a pile of dead people. Who wants to go to a new-spangled town when there's a scene like that in the middle of the commons? It doesn't add up - there comes a point where you have to drop real cash to save them. The medical facility that I purchased? Useless as well. I suppose my point would be to make certain buildings more effective to the cause. I want to pull my hair out watching the nurse stare at sick people, and the sheriff allowing all the hootinanny go on right in from of the office.<br /><br />My bottom line is, I want to enjoy this game, and I have - at the lower levels. But when I can't play a game effectively due to needing to drop real cash to continue, it's no longer &quot;smart play&quot; (think old arcades, pinball machines, etc.), and it's no longer enjoyable. The medical aspect really needs to be toned down (I'm playing a settler game, not Medical Errand Boy Extreme). I greatly enjoy the variety and humor, as well as the freedom to meld your own western vision of a town. And I do apologize to the developers for being (perhaps overly) critical, especially since this game is so well made and designed spectacularly. I was addicted for quite some time.

0374533571|4.0|I'd actually seen the movie first, so was a little taken aback by the way the main character spoke, in the book.  However, I did like it, and have loaned it to several people who liked it, also.
B00C46QUCK|5.0|Catch her performances on You Tube. Hard to tell that she is Dutch. When interviewed she comes across as very classy.
0345404475|5.0|The questions Dick raises in his novel are not very original sounding today, but they were revolutionary for their time. Computers had negligible processing power and while science fiction luminaries like Issac Asimov had written widely on the topic of robotics, Dick is the first one to wonder if the line will ever become blurred or practically nonexistent. Published in 1968, it preceded Asimov's Bicentennial Man by almost a decade. There is no comparison anyway. Asmiov's robots are happy morons who follow the three laws faithfully; if they misbehave it is only the result of conflicting orders accidentally, or intentionally, given by their human masters. When we are surrounded by sophisticated androids it is possible we may begin wondering what it means to be human, we may find ourselves wondering if we ourselves are nothing more than biological robots---or wondering if we are literal androids. Convincing AI may be able to elude us, may be able to pass even our finest tuned Turing Tests. Whatever happens, this is still a smashing read. Get a copy.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Phillipa Gregory has done it again! I absolutely love all of her books, with the exception of the Red Queen(I really just do not like Margaret Beaufort) and this book is no different!!! You immediately fall in love with Elizabeth which isn't hard considering who her mother was. Although I was always thrown as to why she was in love with her uncle. Gross. Totally different times we live in I guess.
B008FOB124|5.0|Brendan and Lisa add so much to the deep, haunting mood; something ancient and forgotten. One can't but help but be transported to another place. They are original and unique and will never be copied, and shouldn't.
B0041RTE50|5.0|I wish someone would create something like this for today! Jane Austen was an amazing author and this movie depicts her book so well! I very much enjoyed watching it. I wished it were longer! Definitely my favorite version of Emma.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Interesting to learn there is a language in flowers. I didn't connect well with main character, Victoria. Perhaps you aren't supposed to because she us so flawed.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Really beautiful doll.  Her clothes are gorgeous and her hair actually is much nicer than many of the dolls I've purchased.  My two complaints are that the paint job on her legs seems a bit haphazard and her skin is way darker than the prototype image(I guess this isn't a complaint, it's just more purple than I expected).
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Absolutely outstanding and emotionally involving. I could not cry because my wife was watching also. Looking forward to seeing a live promotion.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My grand kids love this movie from the youngest that is 5 to the 10 year olds. I actually liked it too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so, so much! It was very exciting and I would recommend this book to my niece.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|LD is the ultimate comfort movie. I've seen it thirty times or more and know every word. It just doesn't get any better, especially in Blu-Ray
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|well it is one if the best games I have ever plaied it is so fun and I can not stop playing it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Already looking forward to season 4.  It's a really good luck at the different levels of society in England pre-WWI and then during and after the war.  All the characters were well played and you will grow with the show.
B004CMBZJC|5.0|Stumbled upon the third series playing on BBC America and was hooked!  Immediately started watching Series 1 and haven't been able to stop - great characters and Jack Harkness is HOT!
0670026638|5.0|Wow, what a rich, luxurious tale! There is so much in this story, I don't know where to begin. Or end.<br /><br />A woman living on an island near Vancouver finds a Ziploc bag on the beach. The bag contains a two diaries and some letters. As the woman reads the diary, the reader learns about the diary-writer, a Japanese girl, and the bullying and family tragedies she suffered. This story has so many aspects and facets, and all are woven in throughout to create a smoothly flowing stream of a story.<br /><br />There is Zen Buddhism here, and friendship, and bullying and wisdom, and suicidal tendencies and naked hope. There's humanity, in all of its glory and shame. This book sucked me in like the ocean vortex, an inexorable obliteration. I went gladly, consumed by the poetry Ozeki used to relate this story.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|this movie hit A home run, What a movie. If your like Denzel this is a must movie to GET.......
1781162646|4.0|I've always loved Stephen King's writing and his characters, but I didn't like the horror aspects of some of his stories.  This one has none of that (a little sip of supernatural, maybe, involving a couple of ghosts, but it works).  It's a fantastic story, written from the point of view of a sixty-something man looking back on one particular summer in his life.<br /><br />Devin Jones spent a summer working at an amusement park, selling fun, learning the carny lingo (King calls it the Talk) and dressing up in a dog costume to dance around and entertain the kids.  He loved the work and the park so much, and was so intrigued by the story of a murder that had taken place there a few years previous, he decided to take a semester off from college and stay on as the park buttoned up at the end of the season.  He met a single mother and her son Mike, who was afflicted with muscular dystrophy and lived in a Victorian house on the beach near the amusement park.  Mike was my favorite character, an old soul in a young body.<br /><br />Read this one to escape your routine and meet some new (fictional) friends - take a semester off and stick around to enjoy the lingo and sell some fun.
B00CNIDGVW|5.0|Godzilla 1998 is not the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life. Hands down. But what i will say is that at 9 years old, watching this movie on the big screen was a huge wow factor. Number 1, it had NEVER been done before. We have had Jurassic park 1 and 2 where the cgi was crappy on 2nd film and the animatronics on 1st film was amazing, but what Godzilla 1998 did was entirely different. It took the limits of what was the most special effects they could use at the time. So in 1998, all of it looked real; and felt real while watching it. Especially at 9 years old.<br /><br />Number 2, it captures the 90's. From all of it's Simpsons voicers and music on the cd, it gives me the feel that X-Files Fight The Future gave me (also released in 1998). It literally takes me back in time with the actors and the David Arnold's music score..etc... Upon the release of the film, you remember as well as i do Taco Bell on board with \\"here lizard, lizard, lizard\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, it's not that the movie is amazingly beautiful, because it is not. But it means more to me (and everyone else that may have been born in the late 80's) than a crappy movie. It will forever be in my favorite film list because of who i was and who i am today.<br /><br />-BS DARTY
B007REV4YI|5.0|I first saw this film in the theater and really enjoyed it so I wanted a copy for myself.  I seem to notice something new each time I watch it which encourages me to watch it again every so often.  Lots of action and the scenery is awesome!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book so much! And it was so touching! It made me think of how lucky I was to have parents from the day I was born and still t and care of me and love me.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I was so taken in with the story and scenery in this movie.  The far out imagination was brought to life in a wonderful presentation. The use of color was awesome!<br /><br />The negative I want to mention was that the Blu-ray 3D did NOT work.  It wasn't a 3D version.  I watched both disks and they were the same format.  I was very disappointed because I really wanted to view the 3D version.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story was very unpredictable.  It had a lot of twist and turns in it, that made me glued to the story.  I couldn't put t he book down.
B008220BLG|5.0|I love this movie, never got to see it in the theater but decided to buy it after watching some scenes from it. Very unique, original story. I recommend it for anyone
0440237688|5.0|I had to get this book for class and it is a great book! Plus it's at a great price.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Love this movie, i would recommend it to anyone. Its absolutely hilarious-I HAD to own it so i finally bought it!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I hope this book inspires the general public to become more informed of our overly punitive and long sentences and embrace mercy.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I knew when purchasing that I shouldn't expect best acting or story but what a surprise! I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The actors just looked like they were having fun with the movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game can be played like forever you can play this game and have fun with your friends some how but I still don't know how to invite people who are next to you in real life give it 5 stars it worth to download
B00E8S2KV2|4.0|Being a long-time Tolkien fan I am well aware where the powers that be took some artistic liberties with this story, and can fully understand some of the criticisms of this particular film, but those didn't ruin the experience for me in the least; in fact, I was fine with many of the changes. As is usually the case with book-to-movie adaptations, changes from the source material were to be expected, but I couldn't say that all of them made sense both story-wise and necessity. Unexpected Journey is the first installment of a trilogy about the singlular story called There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale and it is presented in the awe-inspiring Peter Jackson format.<br /><br />While I agree with those who feel a trilogy of 3-hour movies was not necessary for this one story, as an obvious money-grab, I very much appreciated the depth given to the Dwarves' plight with Smaug and some of the additions through use of the appendices and Silmarillion. What I personally didn't care for was a few unnecessary changes to the dialog, particularly during the Troll scene and riddle game with Gollum, and the addition of Azog, with his followers attacking in the daylight no less. The pale orc's entire purpose was a very weak plot point IMO, to wipe out the line of Durin. Thorin is the last one in that family line and he's a poor nomad, so the footnote character's addition would be more putting him out of his misery than some vague desire for revenge. Why PJ et al decided to use a dead character instead of Azog's son, Bolg, who will make an appearance later anyway, is beyond me; plus avenging your father's death is a much better rationale for diverting from the source material. I also felt a few scenes looked a bit cartoonish, such as with the trolls and goblins, more so than with LotR. Overall though, the visuals, score, and writing were excellent and fairly seamless.<br /><br />As far as the actual product goes; it's that those who are still primarily using DVDs were remembered in regards to extras, but it still isn't very consistent. There's no reason why DVD and BR can't have the same special features, at least for the most part. However, in the collection of video blogs, provided in the special features, I found it amusing that until around the last 15 minutes (of more than 2 hours) they were talking about only 2 movies and showing us scenes that will be in the second film, since it wasn't approved to become a trilogy until late July 2012. In regards to the added 13 minutes for the extended edition, as it often happens with these things, I'm left wondering why some were edited out and other parts remained. Frankly, I felt around thirty minutes of the theatrical version could've been cut to not only `trim the fat' as it were, but also make the extended edition a more worthwhile product. There were a few gems in those 13 extra minutes, such as the song at Rivendell, but if you already have the regular version I'd recommend trying to catch the clips online before purchasing it to see if it suits your fancy.gards to extras, but it still isn't very consistent.

0515142247|2.0|I gave the first Reacher novel a 4 star rating by reviewing the book as the first attempt by a new author and completely over looking all of the errors Child made. I was willing to give the author the benefit of a doubt. I simply cannot be so generous with the second attempt. In the first chapter there are so many errors that it is obvious the author made NO attempt to research firearms. If he is too lazy to do basic research on firearms it is doubtful he would spend the time to research any other aspect of his narratives, so why should I spend any of my time and money reading his work?<br /><br />A few quick examples from the first chapter: The Glock has no safety to actively engage/disengage (the only external safety is the trigger safety). The Glock 17 was designated '17' due to its position in the development cycle (it was Glock's first model actually released), not because the firearm holds 17 rounds in the magazine. The Beretta 92 was not chosen over the Glock in the military trials as the Glock was not in the competition (Beretta barely won out over Sig Sauer). While the Beretta 92 has a 5 inch barrel and the Glock 17 has a 4.5 inch barrel there isn't a huge difference in ballistic characteristics between the 2 firearms. The Glock does not have a firing pin but is striker fired. The Glock frame is constructed of a polymide (Nylon) and not a polycarbonate.<br /><br />Shoddy/no research concerning the firearms probably means shoddy/no research on anything else (that was the pattern in the first book of the series). I am done with sending money to authors who are lazy and/or uncaring to put forth even minimal effort to learn about the subject they are writing about.

B00B7VZN76|5.0|This is when the series really started to click. Character development was fleshed out and the series became must-see TV.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|This was such a good movie. I really didn't know the Beatles has sang all those songs. This movie led me to look into the Beatles more and purchase some of their music. It was very cool how the songs went with the movie story. I also enjoyed how they did the artistic visual music numbers as well.
B00498YZH8|4.0|I liked the book better.  The movie was kind of dry.  Read the book.  Book depicts some of the poor and desperate in rural america better.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|Saw this concert on PBS; it was great!  Hoping that it was identical to the televised concert, I ordered the CD.  Unfortunately, most of the dialogue between the artists is abruptly edited out.  The dialogue during the PBS program was fun and informative relative to the songs, so that was disappointing.  I still recommend the CD.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Different.  Interesting.  Pretty to look at.  Reincarnation stuff.  Random tales about reincarnated people and how they meet and re-meet in different times.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Well my Husband thinks this was a chick flick (it wasn't) but we both enjoyed it.  Good action, story line and effects
B00DGN51O8|2.0|The people were average looking and so was the scenery--so no escape from realism.  Kids liked it.  Too slow and boring for me.
1449320104|5.0|A lot of useful code in one book, can you ask for more? While I found it hard to use as textbook, as a reference it is priceless to me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really liked this book because the story takes place during World War II, and it tells how the lower and upper classes coped during war time.  There were sad times and happy times.  I also liked how the author illustrated how the various characters changed throughout the book.  I cannot wait to read the third book of the series.  I feel that if a person would like to learn about the history of World War II, he should read this book.  Follett is a wonderful writer, because his work flows; his writing is easy to read and his books are very interesting.  I have the book both on Kindle and I have a copy of it.  It is a wonderful book.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love this game... I almost finished it then the game crashed and I lost everything.. I suggest you get the game but don't be shocked if yore town disappears
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|a story similar to the Grinch with some very clever scenes.  Loved the bedtime story scene with The Three Little Kittens
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I've had to replace this a few times with store bought and they were poorly made. The end that was hooked into the tablet was weak: if it fell while still connected it was as good as dead. Thankful this one is sturdier and worth every penny.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This was a wonderful movie, wanted to see this one and Before Sunset so we could see the new one that is out in the theaters now.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a very great book to read I will recommend it to everyone I know. It is now my new favorite book

B0083Z6AH6|4.0|It's a really good book despite the fact that for others was a little bit boring. Indeed, I believe that it requires patience to finish it.<br />I like all Jane Austen's books.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Disclaimer, this is my first time watching and using Amazon's Instant Video service. So the video quality was great, and the fact that I could see other like films to for free was amazing. Though there were others that I wanted to see but couldn't for free. I would definitely use this service again. However if more films were available to be see for free with prime membership, it seemed that all the movies I wanted to see weren't available to see for free. Besides that, also if Amazon Instant Video would be available on Android and other tablet devices besides Mac and apple products, that would be great. For the meantime I will continue watching such free movies on my laptop.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I haven't the money to spend on Facebook Uno. They need to hand out free tokens daily or something. Until future notice its only 3 due to lack of tokens.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|What took me so long to read this Book. Great book will be buying Parr 2 & 3 . .
B005JTAP4S|4.0|Peter is a ten year old boy who discovers the key to a fantasy world that is both enthralling and enchanting. He is given a mission to help save<br />the sacred Shylong who is held captive in the fortress.<br />I loved all the bright vibrant characters and the descriptions of this fantasy world. From the fish that walk to Hally<br />Peter's disgusting friend who pongs!!!<br />There are so many lovely fairy-tale themes in here, from the fairy dust to the magical plants and animals, it runs at a very fast pace and holds the reader's interest.<br />I can see lots of young kids enjoying this, and I can see lots of adults enjoying it too.<br />A great read.
B0086700CM|1.0|I like the second one better because the second one has gems and it has mine carts and it is harder
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Great game, the puzzles are hard but not too much so and there is a walkthrough online if you get stumpped... lol but don't use it all the way through, that ruins it!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|It had me hooked from the beginning to the end. I will recommend this book to others as I know it is something they will also enjoy

B008J34466|3.0|I like the cd but regret buying the version with explicit lyrics.  I actually prefer the tamer version of &#34;blow me one last kiss&#34;.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Using understand what all the people around the world get this.  The one the one thing I HATE about Dictionary is that you learn something with it. If your playing on the weekend and you mom or Dad says read a book and all you have is a dictionary you have to look up words you already know the meaning of. I mean you learn it at school right .I mean it's just wants to look up stuff they already know it's the stupidest thing in the world. Not that I'm complimenting SCHOOL or anything.
B0085KGHI6|4.0|I have been a Stones fan all of my life, and it was enjoyable seeing all of the band in this setting.  It was also nice to see<br />Muddy Waters, who had a tremendous influence on the Rolling Stones, when he was still alive.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great scripts, acting and how each individual fits in their role! I think the producer and director of this show did their research and did an excellent job putting the cases and drama together!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the book started out slow but when I took the time to get in the book I couldn't put it down!! My stomach was in knot most of the book hating Nick then hating any to wanting them to be together ... this book is amazing and I recommend it to every women from the age of 18-40 !!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ive been waiting for the 7.2 update for like two months make it FASTER amazon<br /> I like the app just you should make the dang updates faster
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a cute game with enough of a challenge to make it fun but not too much to make it frustrating.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I went before John of God in Brazil and twice saw the angels after seeing him... There really is an afterworld.... There is a lot of criticism about Eben Alexander on the internet - but don't believe it.... I have faced death several times, many surgeries, and peritonitis as a result of one, and have survived.  I know that there is really a world behind the veil because I have seen it... And I wasn't on some drug or had a near death experience.... Its right here, right now....We all have access to it since we are all one.... I loved the book... It just confirmed what I've known in my heart all along.....
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|This was a wonderful and fascinating movie.  I have told all my friends about it and suggested that they see it.  Most intriguing.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|The story tries to connect the dots to how the Wizard came to be. It may have tried a bit to much to modernize, but overall very well done.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies i have ever seen.  It is a love story with excitement around every corner.  Everyone should see this movie.  Well worth your time and your money.  Totally Awesome!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I have a fondness for most things from Las Vegas, and this band is no exception!  I love old school rock, blues, and hip hop too.  This band is fabulous!  Great lyrics and really good tunes and fine voices!  What more could you ask for?
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This gift is perfect for any Potterhead wanting to relive the magick over and over again. It completes any collection and really starts a movie night!

B000VECAEO|5.0|so glad i got the whole series - one of my all time favourite shows. It got better and better as the series went on.
B0063M22QO|3.0|There are numerous arrangements to choose from and the graphics are clear. It's a fun game to play. It's handy to have on my Kindle so I can play it when I have an extra few minutes.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I did not like how it was written, it bounced between characters and dates each chapter without giving you any clue as to who the chapter was about.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This is a great album! Love every song. Amazon makes it so easy to download straight to the computer and for a great price too.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Not the 'normal' sound for one of Richie's album.  Not the 'bluesy' sound he normally has but you can tell it comes from his heart, nonetheless!  Great CD!!
031603441X|5.0|If you want to know what it was like to live the life of a ginormous rock star and all the behind the scenes CRAZY stories of parties, drugs, musical inspiration, recording sessions and world travels this is the book.  Are you kidding me?  Keith Richards is insane...one of a kind...and some how I came away from this reading with an even bigger appreciation for his genius.  If you like classic rock you got to read this book.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|How did I miss this series when it began?  Do not know, but I am catching up. 6 stars for this series.
1569242739|5.0|Nice book, great ideas. We use it often. I bake 90-150 cupcakes at a time and these recipes never fail to please.
1451668945|5.0|This was one of her best books in a long time.  Great twist never saw it coming.  I highly recommend.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Exactly what I thought it would be.  I got a bit scared at the &#34;micro&#34;, but it is no smaller than the small lego pieces on other kits, there are just more of them and no big pieces.  For a minecraft fan, perfect.  Definately for those that enjoy the more detailed sets and don't just want to throw it together and play quickly.
B007CF7L9O|5.0|I have two daughters so when I had the opportunity to shop for a boys birthday gift I was thrilled. When the product arrived I had to check it out first of course. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the product. There is a good amount of quality in this product. I am considering buying more from this company for my girls now in the fairy tale realm.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Quick download to my kindle fire hd. I don't know who the other reviewers are but I tried for almost four hours to get a page that looks a little bit like the examples in the pitch for the app. There are no instructions, tutorial,or help. There is a reference to a website in Japanese. There is also a sign up for an account for their cloud services.<br /><br />I may play with it a little longer but I think I will probably uninstall it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Great acting by all players.This series really brought Emma to life. Great photography as well
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I have more empathy for those who went through the Christmas Tsunami after watching this moving performance. Cried and was thankful for the little stuff after watching this family struggle through one of the most difficult tragedies of this century. Naomi and Ewan were equally tremendous in their realistic portrayals of the characters. Made me want to look up the real folks and see where they are now.
B001LX2J22|4.0|It's not &#34;Silence of the Lamb&#34; but it's good, any time Tony Hopkins pulls out his Hannibal character it's good! Only wish there was more of him! Ralph Fiennes (of  HP Voldemort fame) does a half way decent Dolorhyde character but he is no Buffalo Bill.  I find the character of Will to be the weakest links. Perhaps the actor just wasn't as into him as the other actors are into their parts. But when you have both R. Fiennes and Tony Hopkins. the scenery kind of gets chewed up....Literally.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|This movie was less serious than I expected, but fun for those of you who want to watch more serious actors try their hand at slapstick. I found it hard to decide if I liked it or not. That's why I only gave it 3 stars.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Interesting and pulled me in.  Want to read more of Khaled Hosseini's books.  Nice to get a rounded real look at the middle east.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Like seeing new ideas pinned by others in various catagories, such as cooking, foods, sewing, weddings etc.Always an enjoyable &#34;look/see&#34;
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was a little late to the Wool party, but I'm THRILLED I made it. I am not a sci-fi/dystopian/post apocalyptic reader - it's just not my thing. But damn, Howey can pull non-readers into his world of silos and make you a fan. The beginning is breath-taking as he sets his stage of death and despair. I love his voice and writing style throughout; you have no other choice than to keep reading to mourn and cheer for the characters. Read it, you won't regret it.
B00E193TM2|4.0|Typical in-your-face metal to make the guy in the car next to you at a red light roll up his window!! :)
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Love this album. I played it on repeat for nearly a month straight. I bought it for my husband and he likes it, so I plan to just keep it in my car! It's a great &#34;go to&#34; album and a great great album for belting along.
B00DS2GBJG|4.0|I can say I like it, but I don't love it. James LaBrie still is an icon in Dream Theater and hearing him with an offshoot is creepy!
B009LROCJI|5.0|I very much enjoy this &#34;recomposition&#34; by Max Richter.  He hears and delivers the music with a new sense of wonder.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Rio was a very good movie my husband even liked it.  He was laughing out loud  our daughter liked it as well so i would recommend this movie to my friends.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|So I got this for my wifes birthday.  It is not like the cd needs promoting, Adele is amazing on her own. Its my wife's cd but I have listened to it as well, great music and soul.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|This album is great.. Ten plus a few rarities, then unplugged just to top it off.. A definite for any pj fan
B008P1EWIM|5.0|My friends and I enjoy camping out and trail riding. It is great being able to check out the weather forecast and conditions of the places that we are planning to go ahead of time.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|The theme of this book is very heavy,  but the treatment of the personalities was superb.  I would like to read another book by this author.
B00A285OOW|4.0|This is by far the best book I have read about Elizabeth of York and I have read several. Having said that, I felt that Gregory, like every other author on Elizabeth makes her look extremely docile and kind of stupid. I felt that the number of times she said, \\" I don't know,\\" was repetitive. I mean, maybe that is what she was like, unfortunately no one knows for certain and it is understandable that she would have to take a back seat to Margaret Beaufort's domineering personality. The book does give a good glimpse into the relationship between Henry and Elizabeth which by all accounts I have read, was relatively loving; however, Henry must have been a difficult person to live with considering his rampant paranoia. The book also paints Henry in a sympathetic light which was kind of different as he is usually portrayed as a usurper ( unless you are getting your history strictly from Shakespeare). I have really enjoyed the five books Ms. Gregory has written about the women of the War of the Roses and I felt that this book did a nice job of wrapping it up even though I wish it had extended through Elizabeth's entire life and the death of Prince Arthur which lead to the rise of Henry VIII.
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|This music seamlessly mixes techno, dubstep, and classical in an entertaining mix.  This album always makes for a good listen in the car as it has a nice tone, but doesn't make you want to go full-throttle through traffic.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|'19' is the beginning of Adele's climb to what will be a long career in the music world. She is one fantastic singer.
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|Whedon keeps Shakespeare's text intact, but changes the setting entirely. Instead of seventeenth century trappings,this is entirely contemporary - with solemn bodyguards, papparazza-on-staff, and a booziness that brings the Gatsby era to mind.<br /><br />A few details work in surprising ways. A woman takes the role of Conrad, and completely reworks the character in the process. Fillion's Dogberry approaches the level set by Michael Keaton in [[ASIN:B0000714BZ Branagh's]] star-studded version. And, in touchstone moments, the conversations that Benedick and especially Beatrice \\"overhear\\" have all the comic quality of any rendering I've seen, and better than many. You simply have to experience for yourself Amy Acker's physical comedy in the Beatrice scenes.<br /><br />This won't convert anyone put off by the archaic language, but might be a good introduction for someone unfamiliar with Shakespeare and with how contemporary his timeless topics can be.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I really love the knife. Heavy duty and handles well. Grivory doesn't seem too slick. Sheath is good but the whole system to attach to belt is garbage
0812979656|5.0|This book ranks amongst the top 15 books that I love. The English language in the author's capable hands is like the perfect mug of hot chocolate on a cold wintry night or a cool glass of ice water in the muggy summer. The author brilliantly pushes aside her prejudices and exposes today's Indian society for whatever it is. Be forewarned that you will not be able to put this book down once you start reading it. The story is a masterpiece on multiple levels, as a love story, as a social commentary and as a map to human character. It highlights the high points and the low points. You feel yourself next to her in every scene.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great family game for everyone to play. It's a lot of fun collecting the bananas and being able to buy other characters.
0440539811|5.0|kind of an alice in wonderland hippie-spy-metaphysical-historical-detective story which will engage you, capture your imagination, frustrate and infuriate, mystify, frighten, tickle and finally reward you in one of the richest, zaniest reads of all time. it's like douglas adams and monty python meets dick tracy and sherlock holmes and you never know just who's in charge or if anyone's even at the steering-wheel at all...one of my favorite books of all time.
B00CDSIMI4|4.0|If you enjoyed the game, and above all, the FEELING and ambience of the game, this is a perfect way to bring you back to that.<br /><br />It's not an expensive soundtrack, and it has its own flavor.
B008Y78M60|4.0|I didn't know the history only the headlines of the shooting of president Lincoln.  Good demonstration of how the people must follow the law but the government can be above it.
074401493X|3.0|This is a good, solid game guide with a high production value. The author missed a few things (like the differences between difficulty levels, since the whole guide was written for the equivalent of \\"medium\\"), but it contains solid maps, with marked up collectibles and resources, it has background info, tactics, puzzle walkthroughs and notes on both single and multi player.<br /><br />Not much art or additional content though.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is one of those novels I feel everyone has read or at least heard of. I bought this book on a whim last time I went book shopping, because I was so curious about what all the hype is about, even though I'm slightly delayed. In my opinion there are two types of popular books: The ones that's popular with book bloggers and the ones that's so popular that people who never read suddenly reads it, and then never read anything after that (i.e Fifty Shades of Grey, which I still refuse to read). Gone Girl, I'm happy to say is one of the former.<br /><br />This story starts off with Amy who disappears on her and Nick's fifth wedding anniversary. Nick and Amy has a difficult marriage due to many reasons: Nick lost his job and decides to move from New York to Missouri where he opens up a bar with his twin sister, funded by Amy. Amy herself also looses her job and in some way resents Nick for the financial situation they are in, as well as uprooting her from New York. In the first part of the book, the story are being narrated by Nick and Amy's diaries, however in the second part of the book the reader learns why Amy despises her husband so much.<br /><br />From the \\"crime scene\\" it would appear that Amy was hurt or killed. Who would kill Amy and why? Is she still alive? Amy seems to be the perfect affectionate wife (according to her diaries) and Nick's behaviour during the investigation is everything but that of a worried husband. In her diaries, Amy says she is afraid of Nick and in turn Nick lies to the police. Did Nick kill Amy?<br /><br />Sounds like a good plot for a thriller, right? I loved it! Gone Girl, is an great psychological thriller and I now understand what all the hype was about. It was fast paced, twisted and thrilling. The best part of the book is the ending, something that most people who has read it, did not expect. When I got to the end, I was like \\"OMGee, that is so twisted!\\". For the benefit of those who is yet to read it, I won't say who the psycho is. However, I must admit that I loved and hated the end, both at the same time. My reasons for loving it outweigh how much I didn't like it, so great ending to a great thriller.
B004SBX112|4.0|On my galaxy s4, the game's screen buttons are too tiny and stuck way in the corner of the screen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this challenging puzzle. thank goodness for walkthroughs. but very fun bravo. waiting for more like it. challenging. but not impossiable
B001KR0BDI|5.0|Characters are interesting, believable, and properly heroic. Story moves along and ends well! Enough romance but no wild sex scenes- which was fine. With the time to read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The ending.  OMG.  George, you're KILLING ME!!<br /><br />A great 5th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  This book does a great job of engaging the reader and continuing the saga of the Starks, Lannisters, Targaryens, etc.<br /><br />Beware that when you finish this book you'll be angry.  And there's no 6th book yet to make you feel better.
B003DWC6LI|5.0|Fab book loved it. Very funny and realistic. Made me laugh out loud continuously, a must read for all women!
0761163808|5.0|This book was amazing.  I almost wanted to keep it for myself, but alas, my grandson will receive it for his birthday.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw the movie Searching for Sugarman.  What an incredible journey and an even more incredible musician.  They don't make them like that anymore.  Anyway, I ordered the two albums that he did make and I love them both.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I'm very happy with it.. I like how it keeps updating so the forecast is always accurate. Definitely a great app!
B00821OX98|5.0|Wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was hooked after the pilot.  Every episode is action packed and leaving you hanging for the next show!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic! Couldn't put it down! It ends with a cliffhanger, so I had to buy Mockingjay immediately to find out more!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|It was interesting, engaging with wonderful imagery.  The characters were well developed and the story held my interest.  I enjoyed the descriptions of both England and Australia.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This started out as a gift for my husband.  When my 20 year old grandson heard it - he is now listening to it as much as my husband.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Loved meeting Harry!  What an interesting character.<br /><br />Interesting storyline, fun charActer development and.  Good paced story.<br /><br />Enjoyed seeing Sydney as well thru his eyes.
B007V4QK02|3.0|Overall it's a good album, but I prefer Oral Fixation vol. 2.  I haven't been able to decide if it's the lyrics, or just that so many of the songs seem &#34;forced&#34; instead of felt & enjoyed.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|Love Paul character & new patients as well.  Good job & looking forward to season 3!  Totally addicted. Too bad it wasn't on longer. Will be looking for Gabriel Byrne in other shows.
B007V4QKPC|5.0|As a relatively new Shakira fan, this was recommended by a friend.  I am so pleased I listened & bought it. I have played it so often it's easy to keep hearing her melodies in my head whenever I wish.  Shakira truly has a superb instrument  in her voice  and it shines in this CD.  I do not speak Spanish, but there really is no need if you just listen, her ability to project emotion is unbelievable.
B00821OX98|5.0|Finally a great sci-fi show to watch.  I was a little hesitant at first to watch it, but all my friends kept telling me to give it a shot. I'm glad I did!
B0041OOJNU|4.0|I absolutely  love the title song on this CD.  I saw the video on VEVO & it made it much easier to comprehend.  Shakira's facial expressions make it much easier  to get the basics to the lyrics & of course, Shakira's easy on the eyes & in this song, easy on the ears too. Definatley  worth a listen & perhaps a better buy on a per song basis.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is truly amazing, she came back strong with a hard hitting dance track, very catchy as well. Sad that this was a rush release, but the song is still amazing. Can't wait for the video too on GMA! And ARTPOP on November 11th!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started.  I was disappointed in some parts of the book because I wanted a different ending but all books cannot have a happy ending.
0061990477|5.0|Purchased it for my Wife and she said she really loved it. Believe I have or will order her the DVD.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I got this for my wife's birthday and she loves them. They have a great sound. Product itself shipped fast and was as described.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|Avril Lavigne is awesome!!! Worth every penny, I hope Avril continues to produce such excellent work. Much poppier than her earlier work
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If your a music fan, you have to watch.  Sound City kept me entertained from beginning to end.  Well done!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a new fun,challenging game. There are lots of challenging puzzles. My only problem is the levels passed level 10 are locked.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent but very to the left was Hillary necessary? I think that politics are really not necessary. Unless of course you give both sides
6305882592|5.0|This movie is for people that don't quite fit in.People who know love comes in all packages.Filmed in an era where love and peace are everywhere,It shows there's someone for everybody.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The book is brilliant. Ir leaves you wanting more after each chapter. Each book is better than the other. I recommend it!
0738711500|4.0|The cards are exquisite with vibrant colors.  I use this deck for myself and it is helping me learn the Tarot.  I am not convinced her descriptions are thorough enough, however I do like how she teaches.  I find I am taking what feels right.  Great for a starter set.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|It had a lot of language - especially from the little boys. It wasn't what I expected and I wouldn't recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is awesome!!!!!!! I love it it's really really really fun and so addicting I totally recommend this game! It's so much fun!!!!!!!
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I personally don't follow baseball however this movie is really good.  I love the interaction between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill's characters.  Jonah brings humor to this movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excelente edición de la trilogía. Grandioso sus contenidos, incluyendo el libro del arte. Para todo aquél que le haya gustado la trilogía pues les digo que vale la pena comprarla.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I like puzzles and hidden object games and this one basically has the two combined into one game. It starts out pretty easy, but gets harder as you go along. The early games would be good for older kids, teens and adults and the later puzzles get harder as you go along.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This app is the same as star girl but more pop star related and I love music related so get this app
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Great kid movie hard to find a movie that is age appropriate and interesting enough to hold the attention of different ages
B005PK57NU|4.0|Good show!!  I do not like the very liberal slant, though. Is that so necessary?  Why alienate so many viewers? And why alienate Christians who were founders of our country, and a large part of our population?
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I am not a hardcore gamer. I play a game or 2 a year tops. That said, journey is such a unique game in the gaming genre. This game is short and sweet. I sat with my 7 year old daughter and we finished it in around 2 hours. The visuals, gameplay and musical score are all amazing. You cannot die and you cannot kill. It is as sold, a journey. It transcends gaming and hints at art. It draws you in and makes you feel as though you are part of something important. I enjoy games like Resident evil and FPS, but this game stands alone creating a new genre. Buy here or download at home and enjoy a magical journey that feels as though it were pulled from the dreamworld. I paid 15.00 on PS3 network and in spite of its short duration it is worth every penny. I will likely sit and play it again with my kid.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book got me hooked and made me want to read all their books right away.<br />I can not wait for the movie version of this book. I love comparing how the movie fares with book! This is worth reading!
0345529057|5.0|I read the whole series cover to cover then bought the new book. Just a great Sci-Fi series that kept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Using this book, I created a Table of Contents for two books and the uploadable files that were accepted by KDP and turned out just fine when they appeared on the Kindle site. This is very well done. Save yourself the expense of buying materials written by others. Kindle has provided a perfectly useful guide, and surely they know as much about how to operate their program as anybody.
1400096936|5.0|Even though the story is completely made up it is almost believable. I really like his writing style. I watch the movie savages and wanted to read more about this crazy drug dealing threesome. When I read the description of this book it was right on par with Savages. Gritty cop story, with a military back ground, Mexican drug cartels, and gangsters. The stories entwine and lead to a mind blowing conclusion. It is just crazy and I could put it down.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|One of the most artificial  and poorly-contrived pieces of dreck I've wasted my time with. If the last Harry Potter novel was too advanced for you, this might  be just the thing. Fails in every aspect of the art of writing, thinking, and novel development. Enjoy your shiny new yacht, kid. You didn't earn it with this entry, buddy, but at least it kept you off the street for a while.<br /><br />Next time you get the urge to paste something like this together, sit on your hands.<br /><br />Just keep 'em outta my pockets.<br /><br />Zero stars.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I agree with some other reviewers. The last version was better than the current one.  It was clean and easy to read and I don't think there were any ads. If there were i didn't notice them.  I can still find the information I'm looking for but I just don't like the interface.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A really good time killer if you're bored or just like the escape kind of games. Not enough levels but would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OMG the new update is like so fun me and my brother and our friend always play this game :)
B001NA6096|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was quirky and fun, romantic and engaging.  It was a simple, sweet, and fun love story that left me dying to know what was in store next for the characters, which is why I had to watch the sequel!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I personally think that the game is aw some but the only thing i think they should take away is that u have 2 pay coins 2 play
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this completely fabulous app!  It's genius!  Now when I listen to any song anywhere, I can discover the artist with the push of a button, it's great!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Easy to use because it's on my Kindle. Restored a few photos, turned out better than the ones on my laptop. Using touch screen to touch is a lot faster than on laptop.<br />Auto fix feature better than most programs.<br />User friendly.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Works great, looks beautiful and is customizable for the features and locations you want.  Well worth the purchase price of $1.99 for a very informative and visually pleasant app..
B006GWO5NE|2.0|The extension works sometimes and sometimes not which is very disappointing.  The ends of the 5ft cable do not fit in the ends of the extension which may be the cause of the problem.  The ends do not fit snugly, go figure.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|A delightfully angry young man. One suffers with him all the way through his adolescence,his acne and his sexual frustrations. A good read.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This is a nice way to remind yourself. Love that my kindle fire and my phone can sync!!  Now if you could please let me pick a alarm sound it would be awesome!
B002HXR542|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. Though similar to Quarantine, REC felt scarier due to the connection with realistic characters contrasted with in your face horror scenes.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Cool app.kinda hard to control but not too bad.Cool character and evil demons.it would be even better if u could pick different characters...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just CAN NOT get enough of the yummy Daryl Dixon!! A zombie apocalypse would be worth enduring if he was around. ;) &#60;3
161655164X|4.0|Like it really mutch! Wery good book. But it was also LITTLE damaged from. I still love it. It could be better if it was in a more &#34;secure&#34; box
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so cool you gotta love it. Like it is awesomely awesome. El macho,a cookie girl and vector beat them like a boss.
074401493X|4.0|I like the book very mutch. The only bad thing is that it was a Little bit damaged on the top. But i can live with that
B004SIP9E2|4.0|I have moments in this movie where I moue with distaste but mostly, I belly laugh.  Maturity is overrated anyway.  Need to laugh?  Enjoy things on the earthy side?  Go for it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|If you loved the story-telling style of Jenji Kohan (creator of &#34;Weeds&#34;) you'll probably like Orange.  Great scripts. Series starts a little slow and you may not love Jason Biggs as the fiance,  but he does a nice job on this material over time.  Keep watching--you'll hit full binge worthy speed at episode 6!<br />Love it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a amazing game but it won't update I don't know why but it's a really really<br /> good game
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|love his other works, but this film is really awful. I saw the original French film which was bad enough, why DePalma wanted to remake it is beyond me...and...he made it even worse! Bad acting, bad direction, etc. Don't bother...
B00EH49DXA|5.0|I love this new song. I has a good upbeat sound to it, which is what I love most about Katy Perry's songs in general. I hope this is a good sign that the new album coming in October will be another fabulous string of songs. I can't wait to see what Prism will have to offer!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|OK, I'm sorry to say I had this sitting on my Kindle for almost a year before I read it.  Initially, I just read the just first few pages of the first book intending to pick up up later, but never got back to it.<br /><br />When I finally picked it up again I read the first short story and thought, \\"Wow.  That was a great ending\\" and I was hooked.  I am sorry I did not read it sooner.  Very creative and thought provoking.<br /><br />Very well worth the price!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This product is easy to use.  I had purchased it for my parents who sometimes finds technology more difficult to use than to enjoy.  Within minutes we plugged it in and loaded the pictures directly to the IPad from the SD card.  My parents found it extremely easy and simple to use and now can download their pictures from their camera on their own going forward.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I've read most of the books by Bart Ehrman about early Christianity and Jesus, and I loved them. Ehrman is a favorite author of mine. I've also read other books depicting the historical figure, Jesus of Nazareth. But none of them come close to the outstanding treatment of this subject by Aslan. I had not heard about this author until the hullabaloo surrounding the FOX News interview during which the author was forced to defend his credentials thanks to the inane and insolent line of questioning by the interviewer. But apparently that interview helped to make his book very popular. After reading a sample, I decided to purchase the Kindle edition. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Aslan starts by explaining a bit about Jewish history around the time of Ceasar in the first centuries BCE and CE. He describes in some detail the mood of the Jews at that time. Under Roman rule, the Jews were an oppressed people. There were many self-proclaimed messiahs at that time, all of whom had loyal followings and all of whom were crucified for sedition. Jesus of Nazareth was not so unusual in that respect. The difference is that a small band of followers continued to call him the messiah even after he died, which was blasphemy by the traditions of the Jews.<br /><br />Aslan tells a riveting tale about Jesus the man. He uses the historically valid parts of the four Gospels, the Pauline epistles, and several extant and non-extant extra-canonical writings from the era along with the historical facts that have been passed on by such historians as Josephus in order to weave together a perfectly logical and believable story of the life of Jesus and what it must have been like for him, an itinerant apocalyptic preacher and, according to the author, a zealot. He lived decades before the Zealot Party, but the evidence is strong that he was a Jewish zealot, as were all the other messiahs of the day. His goal was to establish the Kingdom of God on Earth with himself as the leader.<br /><br />This bookintertwines the Christian saga with the life story of the historical Jesus in a way that was lucid and entertaining. It is exactly the type of book I had been hoping to find, and thanks to the ineptitude of FOX news, I serendipitously discovered what I'd been looking for. Definitely 5 stars!
B006P4FBUE|5.0|This ap is a pure delight for me as I enjoy picking out songs I know  also like to play with creating new tunes.  I've even been able to replicate some  favorite bird songs I've heard over the years.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|The concept had legs but the execution and character development stalled.  Not worth my time and I have a lot of time.... so doubtful it will be worth yours.  Mass marketing made me watch it.....  I want my 2 hours and 6 minutes back.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I could not put this book down! Amazing read, one of my favorite books by far! Very engaging and captivating.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Adds are no big deal. Same ones all the time. Haven't had problems with the game freezing like the last game I had.
B000FC12YQ|4.0|If you are a fan of Hercule Poirot, you will enjoy this mystery. Even if you are not, the surprising twist is still worth the read. An unusual literary device is used quite effectively. Can't say any more without spoiling!
159562015X|5.0|I liked this book so well that I purchased 10 books!  I've the president of a non-profit group and have a team that supports the group.  To better understand my team and their strengths I purchased a copy of the book for each team member.  The hope is that they will be confident enough to share their strengths and make the team stronger.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout wrote a wonderful book that I totally endorse! I really enjoyed the exercises and the examples of success in the book. The message is easily graspable and therefore easy to share with others. I used this book to attract the book I'm studying now \\"A Course in Miracles\\" which I highly recommend as well. It all boils down to attention and love. Whatever you focus on grows, anything you don't want is false fear speaking (the ego=a thing humans made up to explain why we choose to look at scarcity rather than abundance)so it's a lie. This is a world of expansion anything else is a bold face lie. You can choose fear or love. Pam chose love and so do I. Brilliant job!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good but predictable. I knew how the story would pan out 5 minutes in. The only surprise in the  movie was who the key grip was. (Spoiler alert) Choosing Rocky Ford as Key Grip and Kevin Mucha as Best Boy was inspired.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game is like temple run but better love their sound effects and pixels are outstanding I really love it give it an a plus
B00992CF6W|5.0|this the best game I have ever played it is awsome you can build houses cities and a lot more.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|It's been a while..I was not sure about their recent LIVE album. It was mind blowing. Just knocked out. Thank you Duran!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show has both style and substance. I like the dialogues and performance by Gabriel Macht, Rick Hoffman and Patrick Adams.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Makes you want to read the third book. a lot of twists and turns. The ending is not what you expect.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I love this movie. The cast is great! I love John Krasinki. This is great girls night movie! It's one of my favorite feel good movies.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Got this for my nephew.  I tried to play it but it didn't hold my interest.  He  is looking forward to coming over to play again.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Overall a good game if you like hidden object games with puzzles to solve it was a little to easy for me would have liked it to be a little more of a challenge.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Honestly, you may not completely understand this song the first time or even the second time you hear it. But after a while, you start to see it for the masterpiece that it is! AMAZING!
B005T87QCI|5.0|My grandson loves this game.  He has watched the movie and loves it when he beats all the fighting robots in the game.  This is a great buy especially for 5 year olds.  Not that hard to play and you can stay in whatever level you want to stay in until you are able to go to the next. (Easy, Medium, Hard Levels).  Worth the money that I paid for it.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Great.  Wondered if I would enjoy this movie.  Beside the excellent acting the director brought the story line together, what turned out was one fine movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app. Let's me know exactly where I am, how much life I'd left and when I need to charge it. No more running out when I take my kindle with me on the move<br />Go
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I purchase this because of Judi Dench, who I think is the best female actor of our time.  I did not think I would like the story line, wrong! the director brought this all together.  Maggie Smith , Judi Dench great
B00CISC2DA|5.0|If you love BoC, then you will be very happy that you bough this album.  I should probably be listening to this album a lot more before commenting, but I am just so excited about it.  Its very weird stuff, and kind of melancholy at times.  If you want to know what the creators of this album were thinking, then it is very useful to look up interviews with them on the internet.  It will explain a lot.  Once you have an understanding of what they are all about, what they are getting at, then their work starts to make much more sense.<br /><br />If you like this album, and have not yet heard Music Has The Right To Children, then you must get it.  Its their best album, and probably the best album within it's genre.<br /><br />Does anyone know what the significance of the number \\"822\\" is in the liner notes?  Or is it just random?
B0063GORYU|5.0|i play this every day,  i also play like the other games offered by the kindle reader e books thanks
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Very funny and entertaining.  My kids love it.  It's also great for adults.  I highly recommend buying this movie.  Thanks.

B001GF7WRW|5.0|I loved my old K-66's for the price, which I had for 14 years before the dog ate the cord. After repairing the cord and the dog eating it again, I figured it was time to make the switch. Although I was happy with my K-66's, they took a long time to break in, were a bit too bright, and sometimes distorted in the midranges at high volume. AKG seems to have fixed that - the K-99's sounded great out of the box, and sounded better than almost all of the higher-priced competitors available at &#34;big box&#34; stores. Are these audiophile grade? Maybe, maybe not. I just know they sound a lot better than the $200+ &#34;pro&#34; alternatives. Sometime I'll make the jump and get a higher level of AKG, but at 32 ohms, these are easily powered by most portable electronics, and I didn't have to worry about an amp!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a favorite of ours,  we play it every day and find it to be one of the best
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was the beast book ever!!! It balanced out between beautiful , sad , and amazing all put together perfectly I can't believe how good it is can't describe in words! BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!
B00A3K2PZA|1.0|I hate to Rant on about this movie and I wont go on about the movie, I found it Dull and Boring.<br /><br />Some of the actors did not pull there weight in this movie, wanted to like it, I just cant.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|A childhood game that I love and enjoy playing with friends and family glad I found it because it is great
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie is so wonderful for kids or adults of all ages.  I love the animation in it with the bright colors.  The music in this movie is also awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Even as an adult, it is so much fun. New objectives, upgrades, outfits and more make it worthwhile to keep playing! The way i describe this game to friends is that it is Temple Run, just despicable me version and better! Warning, it does have slight 2nd movie spoilers in one of the levels.
0345803493|4.0|I like the idea and the sexy parts are certainly intriguing but I don't plan to read the last book.  I found myself wanting to know more about the character's lives and less about them getting &#34;intimate&#34;
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The characters have become enemies but mostly friends. Their pain and joy is hard/easy to share. A series I can share!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a very inspiring book.  You can feel this young woman's pain and strength throughout this book.  Truly special.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We watch Shaun the Sheep as a family sometimes...my husband, my two year old and me...so funny. We love it!
1452000247|5.0|I enjoyed reading about Peter's journey immensely from the very beginning.  It's well written with much creativity and vivid imagination mixed with fantasy and symbolism.  This is a great book for children definitely and adults that like fantasy.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Learned a great deal of history.  Was interesting story.  Can't wait for the next in the Trilogy.  Easily recommended to family and friends.
B005HP2JAM|3.0|Greetings:<br /><br />To start with I was a little let down a bit by the quality of the 3D aspect of the film.<br />Perhaps I was expecting too much.<br /><br />Then again its not all about 3D, is it?<br /><br />I use a high end 3D projector with active shutter glasses, high end Blu Ray player, cables, dedicated and isolated power for the system, etc.<br />[System fully calibrated]<br /><br />A lot of bouncing around of the camera [not the directors or film crews fault per se], which caused<br />us [family] to take occasional breaks due to eye and brain fatigue.<br />Once they got inside the cave it wasn't as bad.<br /><br />Content was ok, but not really as special as some of the other reviewers state. But if you are into this<br />type of thing, then that's great, definitely worth a watch.<br /><br />I would have given it 2.5 stars if I could have, based on 3D quality, content, etc.<br /><br />It is what it is, so try to take all of the reviews of this film for what it is, opinions of a multitude<br />of viewers with varying tastes and varying quality of video set ups.<br />If you are interested in the content, by all means worth a watch, but its not as good [video or content] or as<br />bad as some have stated.<br /><br />Not sure if this helps anyone!
0345529057|5.0|Like the header says. Would recommend. Content wise, 10/10. If you've watched the HBO series, you'll love these. Also, great value for money.
1451695195|4.0|Excellent story.  Everyone should read this book and also &#34;Waking Up In Heaven&#34;.  Eternity is a very, very long time!
0307346617|5.0|I'm not a horror girl.  And I'll be honest, my first copy of this book was probably less than legal.  What speaks to how awesome this book is, is the fact that I then went out and bought two copies, for myself and a friend.  This book left me less scared of zombies than of people.  Zombies are zombies: mindless killing machines.  People are, well people.  And in this book they behaved just as people do.  Some of them were heroes, and some of them were monsters.  Some were lost lambs and some did horrible things, not out of malice but to survive.  This is a treatise on the human condition under extreme circumstances.  It read like a WW2 survivor interview documentary, and I love those.  Two thumbs up and a few more that I scavenged from the dead.
1781162646|4.0|\\"Joyland\\" is wonderful. Another great Stephen King novel you won't want to put down. I will say it's not his usual genre but the man knows how to tell a story. I highly recommend this book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i love this game, im 13 and its even fun for me. i love nemo, and this game really is educational and fun to play. easy for anyone to understand.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This APP works great for me - use it daily to clean up everything I need.<br /><br />I started out using it on my Kindle Fire HD (with Silk browser) - now have switched to the more useful &amp; versatile dolphin browser and will continue using it.<br /><br />Very pleased with this app for my purposes !!!!!<br /><br />-M W
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book started out slow but I stuck with it and it became more and more interesting. What I didn't care too much for was the ending....it left too many unanswered questions. I dislike books that end like that...incomplete. Books that keep you guessing. All in all it was a good read.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Victor Hugo is a brilliant author who tells a wonderful story about human hearts and souls. But he takes many detours along the way, through many similes, where one would do. He is a very jocular fellow. If you can sit back and enjoy the detours through the main story you will be rewarded.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I got this and it really works great at conserving my memory on my kindle. I also have it on my phone as well and love it. It keeps the memory usage down and ends tasks as to save space.  I love this app and it works excellent!!
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is an intriguing book, one of a series. i was lucky enough to read the first, being something of a history geek, while also being a fiction geek.<br />The book in interesting right up to the end.  The series explains the pre-Tudor years so well!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played you should definitely get this game you will have lots of fun
B00005O3VC|5.0|Shipped in great condition.  You can't beat Monty Python & the Holy Grail for just good slapstick comedy.  Made a fantastic gift.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really fun but it takes forever to update compared to androids and other things.<br />Other than that it is a really fun app for all minecraft<br />Players
030758836X|1.0|This book was recommended to me as a good read with a poor ending. I decided to read it anyway.  It was a story with a different angle.  It was interesting and intriguing at times, which held my interest, for awhile anyway.  About half way through, it began to drag on like a soap opera. I contemplated not finishing it, anticipating the poor ending. I was not expecting the typical Hollywood ending, but I was hoping for something, anything, but it just dropped off into oblivion.  My own fault for the disappointment as I was given the heads up before reading it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|BEST Book Ever since the event of O<br /><br />I<3U Oz and nice to see what happens when you are looking.  for the event of Oz and books on the event
B00479SVBU|4.0|This one of the few players I could find with bookmark feature i.e. restarting an audio file from where you left off which is an absolute requirement if you want to listen to anything other than songs. Option of usb thumb drive and SD memory card give you enough capacity. Basic features are working as advertised and I haven't yet explored it much.<br /><br />AFTER LEAVING THIS REVIEW NOW I AM SICK OF AMAZON BUGGING ME AND SENDING SPAM IN FORM OF QUESTIONS FROM OTHER SHOPPERS. THEY NEVER ASKED MY PERMISSION TO DO SO AND IT'S NOT AS IF THEY HAVE HIRED ME TO HELP THEM SELL THEIR MERCHANDISE. ON TOP OF THAT THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBER WHERE I CAN TELL THEM NOT TO SPAM ME. OFF COURSE THE EMAIL THEY SEND COMES FROM A NO REPLY ADDRESS. BASTARDS, THEY SPAM ME BUT WON'T ACCEPT EVEN A VALID EMAIL FROM ME.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|This is literally stealing money from your fans. Wow! Biggest pieces of shit in music history. Don't buy don't ever even listen your ears might bleed. And this is coming from a huge kanye fan
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|If you're into New World Order stuff, freemasonry and numerology, you can get very interesting messages through this movie. If you are also someone that understands how our 'matrix' system works, how Birth Certificates define the way our society is structured, you will also understand why the creators of this movie have chosen the clone theme.<br /><br />Some messages and 'wink winks' you might or might not have seen in the movie:<br /><br />1) His number is 49. 4 + 9 = 13 -- 13 is a sacred masonic number<br /><br />2) Mission communications screen has always the number 33 -- another masonic number<br /><br />3) Drone 166 is the one who survives all the way to the end of the movie. 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 -- you get the idea.<br /><br />4) Mission space base shaped as a pyramid capstone, but it's upside down.<br /><br />5) Mission \\"brains\\" inside massive ship has an \\"all seeing eye\\" that is red.<br /><br />6) Julia tells Jack \\"You don't know who you are\\" -- (If you understand the Birth Certificate scam, you know what this means)<br /><br />7) Victoria, when confronted with reality, shouts \\"I don't want to know!!!\\" -- Is Victoria a reference to the population in general?<br /><br />8) Mission says \\"I created you Jack, I am your God\\" -- You can take this message anyway you want.<br /><br />9) Jack Harper at the end is number 52. 5 + 2 = 7 -- A sacred number in the Christian Bible.<br /><br />There is more, but I won't spoil. If you watch the \\"making of\\" section, you'll also notice Freemason hand shakes when they meet in the music studio.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent movie, I'm glad some producers out there have done their homework when it comes to explaining (for those who want to hear about it) how this world really works.<br /><br />.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|We had already seen this movie on blu-ray but had guests who had not seen it.  Unable to find it on our rip off Comcast on-demand, found it on Amazon.  It was really overpriced but we wanted our guests to see it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows.  Started watching current season, found it on Amazon and now I am hooked.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I was disappointed in this movie --- but I may have set my expectations too high ... with all the starpower in the movie, all it turned out to be was a Cruise ego builder ... I wasted my time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a great read. I could not put it down reading well into the night. It was like reading a book of short stories but they were all connected.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I have watched this movie 3 times!  It is so fun.  A great light comedy with redeeming qualities.  Highly recommend.
B00004XQJX|5.0|Ignore every bit of sniping in this thread about Pollini being too restrained, etc. There is a good reason why this recording is still in the catalogue and that is because it is as good as you will get. Phenomenal technique, intelligent interpretation, but no over the top idiocies attempting to prove what a genius the player is. This recording is never dull, and commands your attention from the first note to the last.
B007NESBK2|1.0|Ordered twice and neither would play.  Put them into the computer and each said it only contained one chapter.  Each one started up with the &#34;Do Not Copy&#34; screen and then stopped (froze) at 7 seconds.  Could not play beyond that point, tried several ways around it-all failed.  Would love to see it as Sade is one of my favorite performers. Quality Control needs to check product before shipping.  Will probably order it used later on, hopefully that will guarantee it to play.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to pin an idea immediately to my board and not forget about it.  Plus to see all the other ideas - I'm addicted and have to curb my time on the website.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Came across this and was surprised that Ubisoft put out droid games. My husband plays their PS3 games and likes them, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Very fun and love the graphics. I have to play some of the challenges numerous times so I can make the 100 goal but it really helps with memory and reflex control. Great job Ubisoft. Playing on a KF.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|This is a winner - the third book in the series and every bit as good as the first two.  Jeffrey Archer has the gift of a story teller and I believe he is best at telling a story around family events.  I look forward to the next book in the series - I hope it will not be May 2014 before it is published.
159562015X|5.0|It is worth getting to know your strengths and how you work with others! It is a wonderful tool to learn more about yourself and why you do better in certain settings than others.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I enjoyed traveling through his framework across various examples, experiments, and real life events. Decision making in humans is a complex process affected by numerous factors. His framework allows the reader to dig deeper since he presents it in a simpler form.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Absolutly love this movie. I've been trying acquire it for a while. So glad you had it for an inexpensive price.
B001DF68MA|3.0|I got this for my 3-3/4 year old (33 pounds, not near the weight limit) and he is too big for this seat. This seat is sized so that it'll fit a small child maybe until they are 2--in terms of the seat width and knee clearance, foot holders. It's nicely constructed and padded for toddlers, but does not seem suitable beyond that age. It's a good idea having your child in front, but your child will grow out of it sooner that you'd like. I'm returning this and got a rear mounted seat(Topeak) which will fit him for another year instead. He wanted to sit in front, not in the back and cried and protested quite much at putting him in the back. But once he had a ride on the rear mounted seat, he was all smiles. I won't have the problem of him being too tall for my vision for being in front of me next year with the rear mounted seat although it is harder to balance the bike. This is a good choice if you plan to use it for one to two years then switch to a larger seat but get something else if you have a large or older child
B00A285OOW|5.0|I really enjoy historical  fiction and Philippa Gregory is the best! I have read all of her books. I can't wait for the next one!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I was hoping for a better story line but this did not reach my expectation and I was quite disappointed.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|I like when a disabled character is portrayed as neither extremely brave nor noble.  The woman is also not artificially selfless or sweet.  She chose this service because she felt it worthwhile.  Both of them had reasons for following through that didn't need to be explained or analyzed.  Lesser actors would have created a mockery or an exaggeration but these two force you to think rather than draw hasty conclusions.
B001AFF25W|4.0|I have recommended this book to college students, stay at home parents and colleagues looking for ways to improve their productivity. The book is a quick read that is relevant to all our lives.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|Great AC/DC Angus was at his best. Great camera angles and great clarity. The sound was also awesome. I recommend if you are a fan!
0810993139|5.0|This book came in perfect condition all the way to Australia. The book itself is funny, the movies have nothing on the book. I bought this for my kid brothers birthday and ended up reading it myself. A must have for your family!
B001JIDE3M|5.0|One of the best move I ever seen, It was too funny kept you on the edge of your seat and the Kids love it
B00BHMF578|5.0|Exciting, educational, with some humor. Would recommend to any adult like me who was oblivious to the news in those days.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|The first time i heard it i wasn't quite sure if i liked it since i wasn't clearly listening to it but trying to make out the words. But after i started listening a bit more it grew on me and is now the song i play almost all day. Definitely a hit.
B000001ZS3|4.0|For about a decade, this was the number one choice of skiers to put in their walkman for a run down the slopes. THE seminal electro-rock album. All synthesizer tnstumental.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I updated the game and now i cant play. I will be SADILY deleating this game.... it wa fun while it lasted.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I was surprised by this movie. It is appropriate for both women and couples. I loved the ending and how it was written makes you wonder how everything ties together and you see in the end how it is. I just really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|It is a lot of fun.  Works great. .. Except fir the fact that you can't save anything.  Really? What is the point of even having this app if it doesn't even do that
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Nice to have Rebus back,,I really hope he soon is back. I have missed everything from his character, scotland, story,...
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I bought this book because I liked Ender's Game so much.  It continued the story very nicely.  I'm glad I bought it. I want more!
B002ZG983M|5.0|Highly entertaining.  This is the comic book world, so it is Ok for an 11-year old girl to be sent by her father to fight and kill really bad guys.  Chloe Grace Moretz (as Hit Girl) was the real kick-ass of the movie.  Greatest ending scene is the two school bullies confronting Hit Girl at her new school.  Hope the upcoming sequel will live up to the original.  Saw this after \\"Hick\\" and before \\"Let Me In\\" and became a big fan of Chloe Grace Moretz.  She will surely will be an Oscar winner in the future, just a question of when.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my nephew.  I'm glad I checked it out. It was a great story!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|addicting game. has tons of different characters &amp; powers to upgrade. LOVE that u can also play as the zombies..
0756405890|2.0|Overall, I felt this book squandered an intriguing setup due to a sort of aimless plot, two-dimensional supporting characters, and a protagonist to whom it was very tough to relate.<br /><br />GOOD: Creative world-building, unique systems of magic/sorcery, quality prose, appreciation for advanced academic subjects.<br /><br />BAD: Protagonist is abrasive and a bit of a Mary Sue, other characters are unremarkable and undeveloped (a lot of \\"Wait, who is that again?\\" moments), plot developments have little rhyme or reason.<br /><br />I think the two biggest shortcomings of The Name of the Wind are the lack of a strong final objective for the protagonist and the lack of humanizing events designed to attach the reader to the protagonist.  I could have forgiven many other flaws if the author did well in those two areas, but I feel he didn't do a great job.  Many side stories and side quests, if you will, seemed superfluous.<br /><br />In particular, my biggest complaint is about Kvothe's interactions with women.  With regard to his relationship with Denna, am I truly supposed to believe that they share childhood moments of closeness, meet up again when they sing a duet that brings an entire audience to tears, take long walks in the moonlight, drink to excess together, and find themselves in several situations where Kvothe literally saves Denna's life... yet they don't even so much as kiss?  REALLY?  After seeing Kvothe gain fame and notoriety by accomplishing superhuman feats left and right, Denna remains so unattached that she skips out on him all the time?  And when Denna does skip out on him, 15-year-old Kvothe simply ignores the pretty girl who is rightfully all over him because he saved HER life as well?  Please.<br /><br />Overall, I'd pass on this one.  If better developments await in the sequel, I'm not interested enough to find out.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|This film is often cited as a groundbreaking movie of its time. MGM's uber expensive (for that time) film ultimately at that time barely broke even at the box office, but it was worth it. The special effects were state of the art for then, and Robbie the Robot was over $100,000 to make alone.<br /><br />The plot is naturally cheesy in places, but all the tropes of science fiction from the 50's are there, but upgraded to a more believable level. Interesting to see Leslie Nielsen in a serious role.<br /><br />It's easily worth the $10 to watch it on a download and own it forever.<br />If you're a Twilight Zone fan, watch the definitive Blu-Ray set, and you'll see the space ship prop used many many times.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great to read for middle school kids. Also, not bad for adults. I recommend it as a good intro to science fiction
B007N85POS|5.0|Another version of this great game, this time fab graphics and its birds freeing birds, so Far!! theres sure to be more as you get further in to the game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story line and surprises along the way!! Cast is well selected, easy to watch and get hooked!! Can't wait for season 4
0061950726|3.0|On a positive note: the story is simply written and compelling, at least the part about the orphans. Unfortunately, the story is not about the orphan trains, only a small part to get the protagonist from point A to point B. The section in the present about Molly, a teenager bounced from foster home to foster home, is not good. The girl, Molly, comes across as whiny and self-absorbed, which is not surprising and possibly understandable given her life, but it makes a poor contrast to the orphan Vivian, who was strong and stoic in the face of all her pains.<br /><br />I thought the book was about the orphan trains, so I feel let down by the title, which is misleading. If you want to learn about the trains, this book only gives a superficial description. If you want an emotional read about triumph over adversity, then it is a good book.<br /><br />It is actually better suited for teen readers.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Enjoyed watching with teenage daughter. Had some humor along with action. Loved Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman. Interesting plot. Yeah!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update is horrible. It is so far from user friendly if you want to see multiple areas at once.  I would not waste my time with this update on kindle fire and I am deleting it when this review is finished
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Great to have a calculator when I need it.  I really like my Kindle Fire and the apps and hoping for even more apps.
B004N6369Y|1.0|This book was horrible.  I have read many Danielle Steel books in the past.  This one I listened to on CD, which made it worse.  I kept waiting for a plot or some kind of substance, but it never came.  As others have noted, she keeps repeating the same descriptions and tired phrases over and over again. The characters shift from these perfect people, to incredibly spoiled and selfish in a heartbeat.  I frankly have two more chapters to read, and I couldn't care less if I finish it because there is no questions to answer.  Had I not been bored while driving, I never would have stuck with it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I really am not  that skilled at this game but it is a lot of fun to be able to play this game on my KindleFire.  I absolutely love the capability of this tablet.
B00190OHD6|4.0|I liked the movie. Gerard Butler was incredible. Touching and enjoyed watching her journey toward healing. I would watch it again.
1579128955|5.0|This books is highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about the elements and periodic table. It contains plenty of pictures and examples of how elements are used. It is an excellent resource for teaching middle school students to adults.
B006PAV1XO|5.0|Loved this movie. This was the soundtrack to my 80's. Never been a Kristin Stewart, but love her in this movie.

0786915749|3.0|I generally try to stay away from media tie-ins.  For one thing, I'd just rather read original fiction. For another, as far as I'm concerned, media tie-in novels are marketed towards the core fan base of the franchise in question - in this case Dungeons and Dragons - therefore they are critic-proof.  Most fans will write reviews that speak of the literary brilliance of the author, and how the book was flawlessly written, even if it isn't the case.  So when trying to find a new series, you can see where it becomes hard to find one that is actually good.  With that being said, \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\\" isn't an exceptionally well-written book, but it isn't a bad one either.  It's a fun read that you can get lost in, but don't expect to find anything groundbreaking.<br /><br />My D&D fandom isn't very deep.  In fact, this was the first novel I have read that was based on the legendary pen and paper RPG.  And no I haven't played the game either.  But I am always looking to broaden my fantasy horizons, so I decided to give this novel a shot.  Now I wasn't expecting George Martin, or Brandon Sanderson level of detail or world building, but I wasn't expecting some low-tier material either.  \\"Dragons\\" is probably somewhere in between.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of nine main characters that had separated to pursue their own quests and pledged to return in five years later.  All of the characters fulfill your typical fantasy tropes (mage, warrior, paladin, etc.).  On the eve of their reunion, the Companions discover that the village where they are meeting has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the Dragon Highlords, a group of creatures that are preparing to conquer the entire known world.<br /><br />Okay so lets take a look back at what we have here: typical fantasy characters... check, your typical Tolkienesque plot that revolves around an unthinkable evil taking over the world upon being summoned... check.  Well so far we aren't exactly setting the world on fire in the originality department.  You don't have to be the love child of Albert Einstein and Steven Hawking to predict the plot well in advance of the ending.<br /><br />Now that I've got most of the bad things out of the way, I will admit that some of the characters were pretty interesting.  Tas the kender and Fizban the mage were entertaining and added to overall value of the novel, while the relationship between Goldmoon and Riverwind was intriguing.<br /><br />\\"Dragons of the Autumn Twilight\\" is a fun beach novel.  It's can be read pretty quickly without putting much thought into the plot and backstory.  Although having simple and clean prose can be seen as a good thing, sometimes this novel felt like it was written as a young-adult novel.<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend reading this novel if you are interested in a fun fantasy novel that lets you enjoy reading without doing to much work.  Other than that, it is probably for the best if you stick with Martin, Sanderson, or Kay.<br /><br />Three Stars.k.

0312370849|5.0|A magnificent book. When I read it I had no idea how much France was involved in the killing of Jews. I had the pleasure of spending two months in Paris. When I learned that I would be going to Paris, what I wanted most to see was the memorial for the victims in SARAH'S KEY. I was able to see it as well as the museum.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|so the movie itself - It was OK i guess. Scary movies lately have been a bit of a bummer. I think I jumped once in the movie, but the rest of the time I knew what was going to happen. I guessed it within the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />this movie was rated R, but Im not sure why...No swearing, no boobs, no gore. Not sure why they couldnt give it a PG-13, but it really didnt have anything to crazy in it.<br /><br />I want to pee my pants when watching a rated-R scary movie...I didnt want to guess the ending right after 10 minutes of the movie and then not jump at all during the whole thing...little bummed out on scary movies lately, the industry needs to pick up their game!<br /><br />Im not super picky though, so it was okay.
B008602KQI|5.0|Baller ass movie! Lemme fill you guys in, Jen Lawrence fights bees, dogs and some people. If you don't think she is sexy with a bow and arrow, you just might be an extraterrestrial!! Or a bat, DUH!!!!! Bats absolutely HATE this film. But that's alright, because Jen Lawrence is allergic to 'em. I gave this film 5 stars, although it deserves like, 12. I can dead lift 200 lbs, but that's neither here nor there....IT'S EVERYWHERE, you dummies. Get a DVD player, buy this movie on DVD, and watch it with someone (unless it is with bees, dogs or people. They wouldn't like some of the parts) Seriously, the best movie since My Date with the Presidents Daughter. Disney Channel, WUT!?
B009WUBERW|4.0|Old stars get together and blow things up.  Good violent movie with lots of explosions and no plot.  Do not expect a masterpiece here and if you want explosions and gunfire, this is not too bad.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I ordered this back in June and it came on time. I don't usually write product reviews, which is why I'm only reviewing it now. It's amazing, I love every song on here! However, it's really expensive and the case came with two small cracks. At the time I ordered it, it was around $20, and for that price it should be in perfect condition. I'm still giving it five stars because I love the actual music too much not to, and it's no longer so pricey. I'm a bit biased though, because Bastille is my favorite band. They are worth every penny to me and now I have something for them to sign. Besides, it was better than waiting MONTHS for Bad Blood to become available in the US, although it may be worth the wait for other people since it's mid August now and you don't get the extra songs here that are on the itunes preorder.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I don't understand all of these rave reviews for this movie.  It was awful.  I kept watching it, waiting for something to happen, which it never did.  I am baffled by how well this movie has done and every person that I know that attempted to watch it thought it was just as horrible as I did.  Don't waste your time or money.  You can't get either one back!
B00632HWOG|4.0|It is a great website that I use every day.  It is very easy to navigate this<br />website as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like watching YouTube from my TV. Simple as that. I can't wait to see what else will be available to stream.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a good game to play when you have nothing else to do.  It is fun and keeps you<br />interested.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|definitely this product is very beautiful, the packaging is super beautiful and the watch itself is very nice, I like the colors and the final presentation of the same in the original packaging has been attentively
B00CBRAD2A|5.0|I love Arnold Schwarzenegger movies! All of 'em, even the not-so-good ones, exhibit a certain panache that is uniquely Arnold. The plot is usually minimal, the dialog often banal (okay, usually banal), but the action is non-stop if sometimes contrived. Who can forget, &#34;I'll be back!&#34; from &#34;The Terminator&#34;? I got &#34;hooked&#34; years ago when I first saw &#34;Conan the Barbarian.&#34; Here was a kid from Austria with that wonderful accent, a perfectly sculpted physique, and almost no talent for acting who worked hard to make a successful transition from bodybuilding contests to Hollywood movies. Arnold hasn't just lived the American Dream, he is the American Dream who achieved success the old fashioned way: hard work and self-improvement.<br /><br />The Last Stand is about Arnold stopping the &#34;bad guy&#34; from escaping to Mexico. Failure, despite age and lack of resources, is never an option. Along the way there is humor, pathos, plenty of bullets and explosions, fast cars and a decent supporting cast. You just have to disconnect your rational mind and sit back and enjoy it. If you enjoy Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, this one is an &#34;old folks&#34; version of all that have come before.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Yes, Kanye is talented. I've bought all his albums as they've come out, and there's been some really brilliant stuff, and some only &#34;decent&#34; stuff. Clearly, he's an arrogant a-hole. But a very talented, clever, skilled arrogant a-hole.<br /><br />This is unlike any of his other albums and intentionally so. It's almost 'experimental', actually definitely is, from a hip-hop standpoint. And some of the lyrics aren't as intensely clever as other 'Ye albums (well, actually, some of his *worst* lyrics ever are probably on this album), but there's a lot to love, too. He clearly has more money, fame, and power than he knows what to do with, and so he's just doing whatever the hell he wants to. This comes across as very raw, but precisely produced, true hip-hop, in its most pure, original form: something different, highly expressive, and taking risks, pleasing its master regardless of what anyone else thinks.<br /><br />So personally, I don't think I'd want to hang out with the guy, and really don't want to be anywhere near his wife -- but I've played this album a ton. It's great. Yes, I said it, it's *great*. But you have to be open to a new kind of &#34;rap cd&#34; experience. This isn't cookie cutter rap, it's not a typical production, and it sure as hell isn't humble. But it's seriously entertaining, different, maybe even challenging. And that's a good thing, and as much as I sort of hate Kanye's persona, I've got to respect his skills and willingness to just do what HE wants to do. I think 15 years from now we're going to look back at this as a real gem (and probably, Ye will be interrupting people onstage to remind them how he is the greatest of them all, etc. at the time :) )<br /><br />One more quick thing: this came out about the same time as Jay-Z's Magna Carta, and I eagerly awaited both of them. I found some things I liked on MC, but ultimately only played it a couple of times. I've played this at *least* a dozen times. That really surprised me, but saysa lot, I think. Try it... with an open mind!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the old version, but the new upgrade has childish icons, took away hourly forecasts, and put ads everywhere.  The old version was user friendly and had a professional appearance.  This upgrade looks like an eight year old designed it.  I'll be deleting this app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun; time fly's when your playing. Would be good for all ages; and builds logical thinking skills with ease.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It is as well written as the others, but for someone with depressive tendncies, it can be triggering. Unanswered questions drive me crazy, and I would have liked more epilogue. Still, an essentially happy ending made the series worth reading.
0061537969|5.0|I could not put this book down. I read it in two evenings and last evening I was up until 3:30 in the morning because the story captivated me. I think if you care about anyone, whether it be a dog, a spouse, a child, a friend or a parent, you will enjoy this book. The characters are so incredibly well developed that you feel like you know them & care about them. The first chapter sets the stage that it will be an emotional book and parts are exactly that. There are parts of this book that will make you laugh, make you cry and make you angry. The story tugs at your heartstrings and helps remind you about the important things in life. It helps remind us that doing the right thing can be difficult, but still worth doing. It also teaches about friendship, loyalty and that there really are people willing to stoop to low levels to get their way. It teaches about life, about death and the importance of valuing today more than tomorrow. It teaches us that if someone was willing to invest in us as a person, then we have the responsibility to invest in the next generation, like the generation before us was willing to do for us.<br /><br />I read a couple reviews where the criticism was this book was an easy read and the writing may not be the best. I honestly feel sad for folks that can read a story like this and end up with that perspective. In my opinion, they missed it. They missed the entire point. This book will not test your intellectual fortitude, but it will challenge your character as a person and your perspective on life. It's an absolute gem of a book. I'm disappointed I waited so long to read it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Seems to work just fine, no complaints here!!<br /><br />Charges multiple android phones, tablets, and even all my crapple stuff.<br /><br />Recommended!!
B005P1YCNK|4.0|I give this four stars instead of five because it isn't necessarily new info. it is, however, well written,  in plain language, that speaks to the everyman.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A series that should never end! This is far from any formula novel, rather a deep dive into a complex world.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Clever puzzles with enough variety to keep you interested throughout the levels. Some are quite tricky!  They're worth the fee and clever enough that I'll be getting the other Quell games too!
B00CISAPJS|5.0|Great movie. I never felt bored watching it.  Moved right along.  Funny and cool at the same time.  One I will watch over and over.
B0092SQ5EG|1.0|surprised she's not doing R- rated movies figured she would like to paid for that kind of thing ba-dum chhh
B005OUHOLY|5.0|Whether you are a struggling musician, or a creative person in general, the concepts Kenny Werner describes in this book are invaluable to personal mastery. This book's concepts cover far more than music practice and music performance, but for those looking for a book that will spark their fire about music again, this is certainly a great investment. It repeats a lot of the same concepts, but builds upon them in different ways to illustrate his ideas about music performance, music approach and music practice. It has a lot to do with finding an internal space where you can return each and every time that you play music. I found this to be very valuable and highly enjoyable. Buy this book and share it with a friend.
B0096BIENY|5.0|These guys are some of the best!  Have every one of their CD (except the 'live' ones).  They make beautiful music, and there's not an Italian among them!!

B00A3NQNUU|3.0|It's okay, I suppose. The grandkids liked it ! Will keep it around for them when they come visit again.
0399254374|5.0|This is one of my daughters favorite, it helps with colors, numbers, and days of the week. It's good to read to your kids as often as you can and this book will help interest them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|They loved it. Will keep it around for them when they next come to visit. It keeps them occupied when they can't go outside to play.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Keeps you wanting more....very interesting plot and ending...am  waiting for the next boo, so hurry up David and get it done!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is cool because you can make pretty much anything you want you can find diamonds,gold,iron,coal,and lether! It's worth the money you got a by it!
B006588YUE|5.0|I've heard talk around the internet about the stock intel cooler being sub par; now I can understand this could be an issue if you didn't adjust the fan speeds, although I don't much care about case noise so I cranked the fan to 100% and it keeps my temps around 32c at idle and it only reaches 43c under load clocked at 4ghz, I'm impressed.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|I really like the gangstar series but the game has lag and crashes a LOT as well as freezes something I would never expect from a company like gameloft. Fix it or I want my 6 bucks back!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's Downton abbey there's nothing more to say. And I absolutely love every second of it! It's just pure amazing!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best reads in a long while. I found myself in Augustus Waters. The connection was so great and just about everything about him was me as well.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is filled with many different levels of maturity. Even as an adult I enjoyed the wonderfilled adventures of the story. Once I read some of it I couldn't stop reading the rest. All though this book is very touching, you must have the patience to read it page to page. I literally wanted to read it all day and night. But, there came a time when I was like Jada(me) put down the book. When I came home I couldn't wait to get another taste of what was gonna happen next! Also, I have kids of my own. I would think to myself what would I do in such a situation such as this. But, what I learned is you never know until your really in that situation.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids play as well as I do love the game and my son can beat my score LOL but it's a must download

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I love Queens of the Stone Age in small doses.  But this album makes me love them in large doses.
B00A285OOW|4.0|This is the latest in Philipa Gregory's books about the Cousins War - and the beginning of the Tudor Period in England. The plot has been described here before so I wont go into it again - but this last Lancastrian Henry Tudor and begins the Tudor Dynasty. It is told in Philippa Gregory's usual style and makes for good reading. Literary license is taken with the history, but so what? You can still enjoy the strory and even learn a bit!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing. Fairly easy to do. Two levels I had to look up on the Internet because I was stumped. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is for the lack of levels. I hope more are coming soon!!
B00336C3EY|3.0|Or Raising Arizona.  Or even Burn After Reading.  If it's on free TV, watch this.  But don't spend any money on it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for the new season to start...this is one of the best that the Brits have offered us.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|But since I knew the ending, kind of wondered at the end why I bothered.  So enjoy the trip, but the destination may be a let down.  Or as Mr. Lincoln once said in a trial, &#34;A pretty long walk to a pretty small house&#34; or words to that effect.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great series....remember my mother watching original series on PBS...give yourself a few evenings to enjoy...well worth the watch I believe
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a very refreshing series, with great cinematography, acting, writing, etc.  Season one was great, and season two is even better...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Great story! Suspense, action, quick read. I did not want to put the book down. Can't wait for the sequel. Totally loved it!
0446554995|5.0|As always, P & C does not disappoint with a lot of twists and turns to make this book fun and scary. Pendergast is beyond himself this time.

B00BRBIA6C|4.0|I was very pleasantly surprised when I heard this CD and found that Agnetha still had the same lovely, lilting voice of years ago.  The tunes are mostly very catchy and listenable, and it was like hearing ABBA again, in a way, bringing back all the memories from my youth.  I am glad I took a chance on this one.

B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Bryson does an unbelievable job describing the whacky and usually hilarious journey he makes down under, much to the delight of readers looking for a good bit of fun coupled with some info about a little known country.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|Crossed continues on where Matched left off.  IF YOU READ MATCHED, you know that Ky was taken by the society and now Cassia wants to find him.  But can she?  Crossed is told in alternating perspectives through the characters of Cassia and Ky, so the reader always knows what is happening with both.  So, we know where Ky is and what he is going through while Cassia is struggling to try to find him.  No mystery there.  Okay, so, honestly, I only liked Matched (not loved) and I have to say that I was actually quite bored with Crossed.  I know, I know, everybody just loves this series.  But, I'm sorry, I just don't.  It's not bad by any means.  I'm just not into it...<br /><br />The story is good and interesting.  But, I found that after Matched, the initial uniqueness and creativity kind of stopped and it just turned into a typical Dystopian novel like all the rest.  I don't feel that there is anything excitingly unique about this story in the second book.  I also felt that the book was really focusing on the relationship between Cassia and Ky, but it was weird because then it would kind of skip over any intimate/lovey-dovey moments.  I found that strange.  Maybe Condie didn't want to have very much kissing and such things in the book because it's a YA novel, but she still could have showed us their conversations when they were alone and things like that.  I mean, she did sometimes, but other times they were skipped over.  I thought it odd that it was that way after seeming to put so much emphasis on the relationship earlier, when Cassia was trying to make her way to Ky.<br /><br />I don't think that Condie did a very good job with the voices of Cassia and Ky either.  I found that sometimes I would forget whose perspective I was reading from.  That shouldn't happen because characters are supposed to have separate voices, through which their personalities show.  I didn't notice distinct difference in the two narratives.<br /><br />Crossed is a very quick and easy read.  Maybe I'm not a huge fan of it because it's a bit immature for my liking.  I'm not sure, though.  I guess I just don't love it as much as everyone else.  I'm honestly not sure if I will read the third book in the series.  I just found this one uninteresting and it kind of turned me off of reading Reached.  Maybe, someday, but not right away.Maybe I'm not a huge fan of it because it's a bit immature for my liking.

B003DGZCLK|5.0|Much as I hate the later Mel Gibson, I love this paradigmic film. Made in 1981, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior represents the apotheosis of a certain genre of Australian films devoted to cars and more specifically to wrecking them.  Director George Miller saw the elements of a great story in the tradition of old American westerns and the mono myth in this bleak tale of a beleaguered oil refining community that seeks to break out of their enclave and move to more hospitable surroundings.  See John Ford's immaculate Wagon Train for a similar film about pilgrims led by a flawed hero.  The adversaries in this film are a biker gang on steroids, anarchy made flesh, if you will, with war paint,  mohawks, lots of leather and custom cars and bikes. They rape, murder, and steal.  Enter Max and his wacky sidekick, the gyro captain, a pair more deranged than almost any save for Blondie and Tuco in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  Max seeks only more gas, a philosophical position of total nihilism. unwilling to engage in any sort of communitarianism with the white-clad denizens of Texaco Prime (or whatever you want to call it), Max engages only with a Feral child who is equally empty. A nearly wordless film, Miller, like the greatest of directors, manages to work with visuals to tell his story (an art seemingly lost in the current cinema with the possible exception of Nicholas Winding Refn), combining epic sweeps of desolate landscapes with tightly edited chase sequences, including  the bravura climax of the film.  I can't help think that CGI has hurt storytelling somewhat.  I have yet to see a CGI film with the primal energy of the Road Warrior.  Now, remastered, the film looks as good as it did on the big screen back in 1981.  I still pine after Virginia Hey, the warrior woman who dies on the tanker truck.  Certainly as good or even better than most Sci-Fi post apocalyptic dystopian films.  Too bad Miller didn't work in this vein more often.  Alas Beyond Thunderdome hasn't the focus or energy of this film.  A world masterpiece from that brief time when Australia produced some excellent films.cus or energy of this film.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|Despite the omnipresent advertisements, this is a workable app. I just have to remember that the advertisements look like messages. I keep trying to &#34;x&#34; out of them, like I do on my desktop.
B002MG2ATY|3.0|Watching this movie is like being trapped with a crazed drunk in a phone booth for three hours.  A series of innuendos, hearsay, and mysterious connections all shot in whatever style Stone chooses.  The worst part of this film is that it lays the assassination of Kennedy on LBJ.  I mean where's the evidence?  None.  Stone made several good film before this, culminating in Born on the 4th of July, but years of paranoia due to drug abuse produce this ADD film.  Lots of talking, lots of head shots, lots of news footage in a massive collage that feels like it ought to mean something, but to me, at least doesn't.  I don't know who killed JFK and I don't really care.  This film's portentous need to find answers derails what could be a straight detective story, but instead we get a credible blancmange that does not stand up to scrutiny.  Lots of well-known actors make this film feel important, but instead of J'accuse, we get a folie a due.  Well, everyone wants a conspiracy unmasked, and here's one for anybody who seeks answers, even if they are suspect.
0316236535|5.0|This book is wonderful for all ages, because the presentation is so creative and the illustrations are so colorful. My six year loves to read it, but everyone in the family of all ages comes close to see the monster disappear. It is just plain fun.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I got this app when it was free so no real loss, but it was frustrating to discover that all the work I had put into editing an image was for not when it would not save.<br /><br />No matter what save option or name you give the file it never actually generates a saved image.  It seems this app may no longer be under development since it seems to have been quite a while since it has been updated.  Save your time and definitely your money as this program does not work and needs to be removed from Amazon.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Based on one of the first and best trading card games out there, this app is by far the best entertainment program I've had.  You have to get used to the quick timing and unforgiving rules (&quot;oops, I meant to do it a different way&quot;), but even the free intro gives you piles of options with different decks and cards to earn as you go.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a fun little app. Very family friendly. My only complaint is that there isn't enough todo for more than minute or two, then you're done for a few hours.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great buy for rewatching from the beginning well worth the purchase would recommend to anyone who missed any shows plus all the great Albuquerque scenes
B0063M22QO|4.0|A Very addicting game and a very fun game to play. I definitely enjoy playing it when I want to relax but not turn the tv on.
B005LLXB9K|4.0|the reason I didn't give it five stars is because when I received  pearl jam 20 dvd the inside of the case was cracked, but otherwise it arrived on time and i'm very happy with the dvd. thanks.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This film is touching, funny, realistic, and has great acting in addition to a terrific sound track. Everyone should watch this movie at least once.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought this to replace a copy that had worn out from being read so much. This is the book that began my love of reading, and I still enjoy it almost 20 years later.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I had to send my old copy back to Fox studios because of the error with the original blu-ray release. If you're looking for a fix, this copy on Amazon works fine.
B001LM1456|1.0|This movie is just plain bad. Bad acting, bad casting, bad effects. The extra scene at the end was th best part, and it wasn't anything special.
B00CTKHXFO|3.0|They add some cool stuff to this game, but read more about it on gaming websites to find the exact content changes are. Legacy collection basically repackages the HD Collection with a few more bells and whistles.
B00CEF014E|5.0|A nonstop page-turning thrill ride<br /><br />I came into this book having read Stevenson's 'Ian Fleming files' and expected Solstice to be a professionally-crafted work with excellent characters, well-written dialogue, and a penchant for the cinematic. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I won't belabor the point: there are a lot of reviews about this book, and some of them will point out all that this short, electric read had to offer more poetically than I. Would I recommend this book to others? Yes. Will I post it on Facebook and my blog? Sure.<br /><br />Is it perfect? Nearly. I found that, like in the other book, the pacing of action sequences didn't allow for much room to breathe, but here they were clipped down even a little further, until they were at the cusp of being confusing. I didn't mind filling in a few blanks in the rip-roaring, heart-stopping thriller action. It's why I prefer books to movies.<br /><br />Two big thumbs up.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This book is very well written but I was a bit disappointed. The media told a rather different take of Dorian Gray..
B0038QN2AS|4.0|A interesting premise written with consideration of the realities of technology, not everything was totally believable but the stretch from today to this reality was not significant.<br />Enjoyed the characters and plot speed.
B0001I561E|1.0|Found to be Defective item which get stopped at certain point and gets back to the beginning.<br />Very much disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|Great writing from a man who is not afraid of breaking the &#34;rules&#34; and delivering compelling story lines, interweaving characters and locations.  Many times I stopped reading to express my surprise at a plot twist or direction change!
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Just what I needed. Works great and very cost effective. Best of all you don't lose any sound quality. Worth the money.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Tom Cruise is truely an over-rated actor and the storyline SUCKED!  The movie was no-good in my opinion and it did not make any sense.  What was it about?
B005PK56TA|5.0|Superb casting. Jessica Lange rocks horror.  It and it's successive seasons are a future movie marathon to be enjoyed multiple times.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|This was a well-made movie with a very good storyline.  The acting was great and the movie had a point!  I love this movie.  The epitomy of 'poetic justice'.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is my second one.  I sold the first one because I didn't use it much but after picking up some more photography gear, I had no choice but buy another one. For the price, you can't find anything better. Typically, name brand backpacks go for $150+ so if you are on budget, I highly suggest getting this one.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Glee is my fav show. I will miss Finn/ Corey Monteith so much and still tear up when thinking of him. He is and will always be a mountain of talent and unconditional love. God Bless the rest of the cast for having the courage to deal with such s HUGE loss:\\"(
B005544TRQ|5.0|love this series. great cast and characters you will fall in love with. lots of fun. can't wait to watch the next season
0767836324|5.0|Classic movie!  I have always loved it and am so happy that I finally own it. It's a great family movie.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Many creative people seem to live lives beyond the normal experiences of most of us.  Frank Lloyd Wright's life was quite a tale to be told in this entertaining and thought-provoking book which makes you think about your own values.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci will be one of my favorite new authors.  His style is interesting and fast paced.  I will be reading more of his books.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|I was surprised at how mundane it was.  Being an icon in the literary world of a few decades ago, I thought this Hemingway novel was quite disappointing.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|AS You advance higher,it gets more harder and not many help items available before you loose all your lives. Good luck.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|Gift for my son.  He got it on time and loves it.  I can always trust Amazon for my needs.
0316228532|2.0|I only bought this book because there was so much hype over it. I didn't care for any of the characters, the plot intersted me zero, and it was too slow. I always finish books and this one was torture.
B004SKQAJI|4.0|great to see him dancing in the title role again.,,More mature, yes, (age catches up with all of us) but still has the moves - new costuming is good, too.
1476715904|5.0|I love it! This is my favorite book (series) ever! &#60;3 i could read it a thousand times without getting bored. Im so happy I finally have the paperback and it arrived even before the date it was supposed to arrive! :) Go get it now!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Somewhat gruesome novel I could not put down. Interesting description of small town life and the social and political hierarchy.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Definitely adult humor, but very funny show. No issues with the quality of the product. This product will stay in the collection for years to come!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love the songs on this album. I would recommend it. I especially like Hawaii 78 about the change on the islands.
140006922X|1.0|I have read the book.  I have watched about half a dozen interviews with the author on Youtube. --Jesus of Nazareth, whom Aslan finds most interesting and compelling (we are not sure why)was nothing but another Zealot with a band of followers.  Palestine was seeing quite a few of these in the day and at least 12 others got crucified for insurrection. And crucifixion was the punishment for insurrection.  Note the inscription on the Jesus' cross.  So, Jesus was just one more.  (It wasn't possible that this was just the way that the Jewish leadership managed to put him to death.  The blaming of the Jews was just a later twist in the story to make it all palatable to the Romans, who were becoming the majority in the church.)  We can see how Pilate washes his hands--well, we are told that this is the most implausible thing one has ever heard.  Pilate was forever putting people to death.  Aslan seems to have no regard for the fact that the Romans had a law and they were fairly meticulous about following it.  The Lex Romana was the empire's foundation and source of success.  It is not like in some versions of  Islam where any \\"infidel\\" or someone with lower human value can just be eliminated, and that's that.  (Aslan says in an interview that he is a Muslim.  But I also saw interviews where he says that he is a secularist.  What gives?)  It does seem a little like Aslan confuses Roman and Jewish law with Sharia.  No, the Romans were not like that.  Reza keeps pounding on his scholarship and his knowledge of Greek and so on, in the interviews he gives, as this gives him a carte-blanche to say just any darn thing.  I have never seen such in-your-face bold non-sense.  He took his education in America, and I think if Aslan had grown up learning Latin and translating Virgil, he might be a little more impressed with Roman law and the fact the Pilate actually had some judicial guidelines to work with.  In any case, he argues that the whitewashing of Pontius Pilate served to makethe story more palatable to the Roman audience. -- It makes you marvel at the hair-brained idea of Jesus' followers to traipse around the Roman world trying to convince Romans that a Jewish Zealot is their Savior from sin.  Does it not?  What on earth was in it for them?    The plain fact is that Jesus was no Zealot, as also the transmitted teachings strongly communicate.  The fact that he was killed like any other insurrectionist does not make him one.  Jesus' whole trial was a miscarriage of justice from beginning to end, from the harried gathering of the hearing, to the contradiction of the witnesses, to the sending him from one court to another to see who would finally do something about him.  He was a marked man.  He would have to go no matter what, especially as the crowd of Jerusalem began to fall to him. -- If he had been hanged as a thief, that would not have made him a thief.  Jesus suffered many things and one of them was this false conviction perpetrated by a number of parties.    Another thing Reza Aslan like to stress is that Jesus must have been illiterate.  He came from the lowest social class and there was no way he would have been able to read or write.  The story of him reading in the synagogue or discussing with the scribes in the temple would simply be false.  Well,-- there we go.  That was easy.  Thank you for that enlightening piece of information, Reza.  Jesus was a bumbling Zealot trying to overthrow the Romans with his rag-tag band, who were all dumb and iliterate.  Let's sweep them all into the dustbin of history.    Reza Aslan likes to step back a little and say how important and compelling Jesus' life was and what a huge and important religion came from it. But he says actually pretty much nothing about Jesus other than that the Romans killed him for insurrection and that he was a poor, illiterate \\"peasant\\".  Sometimes Aslan says \\"peasant\\" and sometimes he says \\"daylaborer\\".  He is not very picky about that, as long as we get the idea that Jesus had no standing, no education, and nothing to recommend him, therefore an unlikely sage or Son of God.    Speaking of \\"Son of God\\":  it is a title the Romans would have understood! (Says he.)  The Jews knew nothing of Sons of God, but the Romans did.  Ah how did this not occur to us before?  We only know that the coming Messiah had been expected and prophesied for eons, that the Son of David was also David's Lord, that Daniel has the Son of Man, etc.  Anyhow, when Jesus says \\"I AM\\" they are all very angry, except for his followers who confess him.  You would think that if he claimed to be \\"I AM\\"  and this was not possible or not expected they would have simply declared him mad.  But no, the idea had traction.  Those who believed, believed and those who did not believe found the idea--not ludicrous--but dangerous.  Still, I have wondered myself that it must have been very difficult for the Jews to accept who have always been saying \\"Shema Israel\\", the Lord is One.  Of course, Christians still say that the Lord is One, and that it is the King of the Universe whom we put to death.  This is really the very most profound question, ever.  Did the Lord of the Universe die for your misdeeds?--Or was Jesus just a Zealot?    People like Reza Aslan and all the other current scholarship, of course, think the idea of the dying God preposterous.  Hence these contortions about the whole New Testament being wrong.  The Gospels are wrong.  Paul got it wrong and he is most of the rest of the New Testament.  So it's all wrong, wrong, wrong.  But he, Reza Aslan, does not say this.  No, he says with all of them that it does not matter if it is true. All we have to do is take the spiritual meaning from it. (!!!) -- I have not seen him expound the spiritual meaning of this all, but the Young Turks interviewer said:  \\"I am an agnostic, but I am not buying it.\\"--Thank you, Young Turk Agnostic, that's because it makes no sense whatsoever.  You cannot get a profound spiritual meaningfrom this whole story being a hoax.  You get the feeling that Aslan just simply lives with the assumption that everyone besides himself is just an utter fool.  It seems to be the great underlying presupposition here.    To finish let's just reconsider the famous \\"worst FOX interview ever.\\"  Aslan was just asked several times why he, as a Muslim would write a book about Jesus.  He did not lay out any motivations or concede any kind of potential biases he was keeping in mind.  No.  He simply pounded on the assertion that he was a \\"scholar\\" and he used a \\"thousand books\\" to get this analysis done.  In the end, the question of why a Muslim (as he sometimes labels himself) would write about about Jesus, is important and not difficult to answer.  The Koran says many contradictory and strange things including about Jesus.  The most important thing, however, is that Jesus, however significant (we are not sure in which way) he may have been, he was certainly not the Son of God.  And this is what Aslan is really asserting.  That is what it is all about. If we can get Jesus de-deified and reclassified as an illiterate Zealot, we have something like this weird man that we have in the Koran, some sort of prophet, but not the really important one, who is, of course, Mohammed.    And now everyone can just agree.  Jesus was in some undefinable way important, in any case, only spiritually speaking not historically.  So whether agnostic or Muslim or modern Christian \\"scholar\\", we've all come to the same place and in the end it is about this:  you can make up your morality as you please.  You can say any damn thing and it does not matter if it is true.  You don't need forgiveness of sins and you don't need to talk about sins, at all.--It's all good. As long As Reza Aslan gets his due attention and Jesus isn't God. Because that can't be.  Shoddy and Shabby work.    Since the discussion below has circled around people's credentials, I will just also mention what Reza Aslan's Dissertation is about. This is the title:  \\"Global Jihadism as a Transnational Social Movement: A Theoretical Framework.\\" It is not that long. We can also see what he means by being a \\"secularist\\" and a \\"Muslim.\\"  The link can be found on the Wikipedia page: [...]    My take from reading this and some other reviews and a book by Zahid Jaffer is that he considers Islam already reformed or reformable.  Jaffer would disagree.  He does not think it is reformed.
B00821OX98|5.0|Although you may see elements of Battlestar Galactica and Jericho in this series, I found it still quite fresh.  As the mark of a good sci fi work, this series pulls you in and makes the story somewhat believable even if the premise is very improbable.
B000HL093A|5.0|This movie might not be for everyone. Second time I watched it and I loved it. Reminds me of a movie made kind of like pulp fiction. Has flashback to previous happenings.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|My whole office bldg., and family watch Castle anytime we can!<br />So I'm building all episodes / by buying a season at a time (pay-period)<br /><br />We LOVE Castle and hope the series continues..................<br /><br />The quality of the DVD was great and the delivery was acceptable!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was okay, but one read is enough. I did not like the way he described his experience during the coma. Weird. The only other thing I can say is that some people might be put off with the scientific explanation of the workings of the brain, but being a neurosurgeon I understand why he did so. It may be a little too technical for some.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Wow, over 2,730 reviews already.  The apparent disjointedness is well documented in these reviews;  it always was a challenge to see who the \\"I\\" was in the beginning of each new section.  It did seem to stretch the imagination with the two boys in the home town where the father was doing the good things with the narc money though.  Having read all three books and being a retired intelligence officer with a total of 13 months in Afghanistan, the Afghan diaspora is this wide spread, and does have varying degrees of interest to return to help their country even though they may have been a generation removed from when their family left.  All in all, the ethnic discrimination in \\"Kite,\\" the minimal value of women in \\"Suns,\\" and the selling of a child in \\"Echo\\" probably will not endear Afghan culture to an isolation favoring American, but the Afghans will endure as they have since Alexander invaded.  One of my translators mentioned when I asked him if he was familiar with \\"Kite\\" that the child sexual abuse damaged Afghanistan in the international scene but he did not want to discuss whether such abuse was common.  All cultures have their warts, and Afghanistan will eventually vanish from the world spotlight again, but the author is using the proceeds from his work to better the lot of his countrymen, and he should be commended for that.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|A fabulous collection of characters and tales that you won't be be able to part with, even after the final page.

B0046B3QTG|4.0|I'm an adult with no children and enjoyed this movie! It made me laugh out loud several times with a few &#34;Awwwe's&#34; in there too :o)
1401937519|5.0|This is a great read for anyone open to what they don't know.  If you are going through a difficult time, this book will give you a new perspective like no other!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|The price of this Lego Minecraft set fluctuates A LOT.  If you can get this for under $35, then bravo!  Most will not see it as worth the price, but the Minecraft theme is rather popular still.  I would not have paid more than $40 for it which still qualifies as expensive for the size.<br /><br />The kids love it, and have been happily playing with it for a few weeks now.  Yes the pieces are the smaller lego pieces, but that's the normal size for the small, flat lego pieces.  Some of the reviews had me wondering about compaitibility issues and there are none.  The kids borrowed from some of their other Lego sets to create more Steve's and whatnot.<br /><br />It's Lego quality - and you get it!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is one of the greatest performances of Phantom or for that matter anything else that I've ever seen...The orchestra, camera shots, on stage talent and everything else just made watching this an unforgetable experience...Ronnie Kole

B003O86FMW|3.0|I am pretty sure that after The Hunger Games, which was awesome, the author could have come up with something way better than this book.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|I watched it but need to re-watch it.  Not sure whether I liked it or not.  I'll decide on the second time around
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is emotionally overwhelming...but in a very good way. Definitely top five of any book I've ever read. The plot is so complex and you can't help but fall in love with the characters.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|Daughter in-law use to watch this movie (VHS) with her mom who is no longer with us  She wanted the DVD for her collection.

B00CATSONE|4.0|This would probably act as a primer for those unfamiliar with the genius that is Nikola Tesla. To be honest, I expected some form of a Biography on how Tesla became who he is, not a motivational speech on how imagination can make you a better person. Tesla was pretty much a strategy to put this guy's name out there.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I had so much fun for hours it reminded me of blackops 2 a lot  great game please get this game it is very very fantastic
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I liked this book. I read all Gaiman's writing and I listen to the BBC broadcasts of the readings and I follow him on Twitter and Facebook. I love his Doctor Who episodes. My understanding is that Gaiman put a lot of personal things from his childhood family into the aspects of the story. That gives this story another nuance.<br /><br />It reads like a children's book, although it is written for adults. I like that style of writing. You can hear his voice as you read it.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I'm confused at all the reviews stating how disappointed fans are with this release of Enigma's A Posteriori. They say at first listen, they don't like it but after several returns to the cd, they began to love it. I'm just curious, if you don't like it the first time, something must have brought you back for a second or third experience. Yes, experience, because that's what all of Enigma's music is. If you are a fan of their music, you should experience the soul and spirit of each song on it's own. There's not another artist out there with the same vision as Engima, in my opinion. A Posteriori stays in my cd player always, it's there every morning when I wake up, it plays in it's entirety until I'm ready to leave for work. For me, it's always playing when I'm doing stretching and Yoga exercises because some of the music is perfect for clearing my mind and allowing me to breathe. I guess I understand why some would not like it at first because they are listening for the familiar. I suggest you listen without prejudice, not just this music, but all music, there's no telling what you will discover.
0374280967|5.0|I do like Alan Bennett.  His plays are wonderful, funny and endearing (the short ones - I haven't seen The History Boys), and so was this book.  A quick fun read about Queen Elizabeth becoming an avid reader after a dutiful visit to a library bookmobile.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Formulaic.  Not the classic Nesbo.  Both craft and content fall short of earlier Nesbo novels.  Boo is this the end?§
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Sledge's spell binding accounts of the marines' ordeal on Pelelieu and Okinawa gives us a view of the extraordinary sacrifices and the utter brutalities of the campaigns in the South Pacific. Although only combat veterans can know the true meaning, Sledge's accounts of valor of U.S. Marines in the South Pacific during WW II comes as close as any narrative to the concept that &#34; no quarter is asked ; no quarter is given&#34;.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Samuel L. Kalush, M.D.
B005GVW05Q|4.0|Super nice album.  Ryan has written some great songs, and has recorded them well.  You can hear Nora Jones and Benmont Tench back there sweetening the pot.  It's an easy album to listen to, with no absolue rockers, just consistent plugging away at the art of good songwriting, singing, and recording.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I listen to audio books in the car. This charger lets me charge my ipod touch while I also have it connected to the jack on the car stereo.  So the ipod is playing and charging at the same time. It works well.<br /><br />There are two slots. One is marked apple and the other android. Both work for the ipod touch. The apple slot is heavy enough for an ipad.
B004LWZW7E|2.0|I saw this movie and it was excellent so I don't want to give the wrong impression.  Would give 4 stars. My son and I were not communicating and I thought this an excellent icebreaker. Too bad he never received it. I cannot even find out what happened as it's been some months now. Now I'm not asking the impossible just a delivery notice or tracking number to see if it was indeed delivered. That Amazon should be able to provide as I am a VERY GOOD CUSTOMER who purchases most of her products through Amazon.com. But guess what? NO Help Provided
B003R50FRI|3.0|Quite grossly overrated. Perhaps with all of the glowing reviews, my expectations were too high. An enjoyable read while never living up to the hype.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|A great remake of a classic - make you wanna get up and dance movie. Still love Kevin Bacon in the original too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Don't simply dismiss this story as teen melodrama. Savor the language, the heartbreak, and masterful plot. No spoilers here, so I will just say this is one I will revisit again and again.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|A London cop that's so good at his job he makes everyone else look lazy is &#34;promted&#34; to a position in what was supposed to be a village backwater.  He lands there as a bunch of unlikely &#34;accidents&#34; begin to take place.  As villagers drop like flys our hero becomes suspicious.  Lots of comedic violence.  The hero cop has a Barney-Fife-Like partner who has a childlike desire to be a cop (never mind that he is already a cop).  Some small jokes go by fast so keep your eyes open: the gag with the swear jar is especially funny.  Also, just when you think you are headed for a cliche ending...you aren't.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper Kerman was just on NPR Fresh Air. I had already read this book and seen the Netflix series. For my money, it is interesting to get Piper's real story because the Netflix show is an adaptation and not meant to be the exact story. There are plenty of differences that make the book worth reading.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season 2 of Suits is at least as good as Season 1. The story line is more connected with some pretty dark overtones.

B00DHQHAH0|5.0|This show just keeps getting better!  I can't wait to watch the third season!  Can't get enough of the humor and amazing acting!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|One of the best movies of the 80's<br /><br />All generations love to watch this movie and is easy to watch over and over.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Another view of Jesus from an empirical perspective. Well written; provides reader with sufficient information to discern myth from reality with an underlying glimpse into the social and cultural mores of the era that impact the readers' understanding of what transpired.  Looks at Jesus without the religious fervor and awe. Excellent read regardless of religious persuasion.  On par with Karen Armstrong's History of God.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|As a faithful reader of PRESTON & Child, the character development of Pendergast has been exhilarating. Love the movement and character paradigms of  this book.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Good characters, well written, and a story line that generates ongoing interest.  It does set up for the sequel, but does so in a way that's still satisfying, i.e. I didn't feel left at the altar.
B004GXL8GC|5.0|Pretty much everywhere you look these days there are smurfs! My kids love having these little figurines to play with and with six in a set they come to around $3.50 per piece - which is a really great price considering how much the individual ones are selling for. I'd definitely recommend these if you need a gift for your child (or, like me, have a million little kid birthday parties to take your kids to). Also, if you want the newest characters, try these: [[ASIN:B00B1D78NW Schleich Gargamel and Azrael Toy Figure]] or [[ASIN:B00B1D785K Schleich Hackus Movie Smurf Toy Figure]]! They're not priced quite as well as this set, but they're nice for rounding out a collection.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Have watched it a couple of times. Interesting cast, very different role for the 3 stars. Enjoyable for all the family. Even more fun if you like birds.

B00AUA67GQ|5.0|This was very easy to use and comes in handy if you constantly need to jot down quick notes. I like the fact that you can use the keyboard or your finger or stylus to write things and then save it to your tablet. This is a super helpful app for me and I would recommend it.

1401924751|5.0|Most of Doreen Virtue's Oracle Cards are similar in layout and purpose. I've been reading tarot cards for over 25 years and prefer tradtional decks for readings. Most readers will tell you that it's difficult to read for yourself due to lack of objectivity. I use Doreen's cards when i need guidance for myself. I have ten of her Oracle Decks...each one has a different 'vibe' to it. Quite honestly, I like the artwork. She finds some really gifted artists to contribute their work to her decks. I digress, this deck as well as her others are great for any person who wants / needs guidance without regard to natural psychic ability, experience etc. I like this deck a lot.
B000W27AE0|4.0|Good album.  Very nice price for $3.99.  Amazon is the best place to find deals on MP3's.  No complaints here.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really like the movie; it was cheesy in a good way and had a good ending, which you don't see anymore.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I've always been a Cinderella fan and a HUGE fan of Tom's writing, especially on later Cinderella albums, and although a lot of time has passed since then and when he STARTED writing for his first solo effort (10yrs), I knew this would be special, and man it is great stuff, practically from start to finish. There are two songs that I might call a little weak and they have since grown on me. Quality tunes and writing covering several genres but mainly GREAT ROCK, as it should be. GET THIS!
0451197879|2.0|Stephen King is better than this.  I always expect more from him.  I was disappointed and am waiting for his next one.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|this song is not your average bubble-gum pop, gaga once again talking about the subject of fame but rather from a perspective of herself while on stage, and this time it's more positive as she embraces the loves and cheers from her little monsters. the music itself sounds European-Underground but very different than \\"Schei&szlig;e,\\" personally I think it's still avant garde compare with most of the pop music out there.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Mindless fun.  Keeps me connected with some people I rarely see.  I have had no problems with this at all.  Simple design.  No bells or whistles, highlighters or sparkles. Most of my friends have stopped playing now. :(

B00005JO9J|5.0|I am a Big Fan of ER. & House. Now that they are gone. And I must say I thought NBC was out of there mind for taking ER & Law and Order off. I mean they were NBC's Flag Ship Shows.<br />I was at the Public Library last week. And I see Grey's Anatomy seasons 1-3 on DVD. So I pick them up. And WOW!  I am hooked after watching season one. It is like ER and House put all in one with<br />a few other things put in with it. Fun, a kick to watch.. And more. And I look at my NetFlix account.. And see they have seasons 1-8 Online and disc..<br />I will pick up the seasons on DVD as I go.. Glad I checked it out..<br />AS 95% of the stuff on TV now is total trash. But Gray's is something to really watch..<br />A new fan..
B006S053K8|2.0|The movie just meanders around. There are a few laughs from the side characters at park but not enough to carry the film.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I grew up with The Last Starfighter and to now have it on Blu Ray is awesome.  Looks amazing for a movie as old as it is and with less than stellar special effects.

B0068THAGY|5.0|Yes the children had to conquer the aliens, but they did.  Perhaps they were able to relate to what was happening more so than the adults!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I don't get the hype of this series. Just remember ladies, if Christian Grey was a normal citizen, he'd be considered a sexual predator. And Anastasia- she's as bad as Bella from Twilight. Pathetic women characters. I read them all because I paid for them and I think the author should cut me a check reimbursing me.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Very well written, unlike many books of this genre. I enjoyed it and the 2nd book so much, I immediately began reading them again.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This movie was very cute and not too sappy. Justin Timberlake is my new favorite actor. Woody Harrelson and Jenna Elfman were in it too
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Aslan's thesis that Jesus was some kind of political radical who was trying to overthrow the Roman government was pretty weak.  He picked out a couple of Jesus' statements and justified his position based on that.  He ignored many of the statements about loving your enemy.  And I never could make the jump that by Jesus upsetting the money changer tables in the temple that that would somehow insure his death penalty from the Romans.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie for the Grand kids!!!  It kept them occupied for a couple of hours.  Of course I liked it too.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|It doesn't.  There are so many holes in the plot of this movie, you could fly the starship Enterprise through them.  In fact, I think they DO.<br /><br />The actors do their jobs well, and JJ Abrams can shoot a tense scene, but the guy can't write a story.  Or at least, not without a variety of gaping plot holes.  Don't believe me?  Watch \\"Lost.\\"  Or \\"Super 8.\\"  Or \\"Star Trek - reboot 2009.\\"<br /><br />Maybe he will overcome this shortcoming (or hire someone to do it for him) with the new Star Wars movies, but if you are looking for a coherent plot and storyline, you won't find it here.<br /><br />If you want an incredibly funny and excruciatingly detailed breakdown of what's wrong with this movie, go to RedLetterMedia.com; their critiques of bad movies are so good, it justifies the time you wasted watching the things in the first place.
0517543052|5.0|I read this book when it first came out. I wanted to read it again, and I wanted to hold the actual hard copy book in my hands again. It is just what I remembered, and more (I had forgotten some things)<br /><br />Re the negative reviews - those are from people who probably were not even born when this book was published, who have no idea what the culture at the time of publication was like, and who cannot appreciate this kind of work.<br /><br />This is a book which was published 40 years or so ago. It is a book about culture and also about spirituality. The culture part will likely be just a sociology/anthropology lesson for people born after the book was published. The format was interesting/exciting at the time of publication. (If the time of publication is foreign to you, look at it as an artifact of a long-gone time, and accept it on that basis)<br /><br />The message in the book is still valid. As my original copy has been lost over the course of many years of experiences, I feel fortunate to be able to hold this one of my most-remembered books again.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|The vocals are nice on this track, the beat to the song is fantastic, it doesn't sound like every other song being made...it actually sounds different. Much like Gaga's previous &#34;Born This Way&#34; album the songs have a unique sound that is their own and unlike most anything else. That uniqueness complete with beautiful, varied vocals and catchy beat really compliment each other well and ultimately create a very nice song.
B0012PDVUS|3.0|Ridley Scott's magnum opus is a cult classic like no other.  Both controversial and mesmerizing from the start, the film has spawned five different versions of itself, this being the last.  While this version brings the film up to date technologically and cleans up various glitches in the previous versions, it also cuts out some parts that I thought were very beneficial in the original.  I am also one of the few who actually prefers the original theatrical release with Harrison Ford's voice-over, which virtually everyone else hates.  The voice-over added to the overall foreboding tone of the film.  The original version also left some parts of the plot ambiguous, leaving the viewer to decide for himself, which I greatly preferred to the later versions which focused largely on making these far more explicit.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Very nice thank you very much for your good and your credibility will be a pleasure to deal with you again &#60;3

B000FC12C8|4.0|I got this edition because I'd already purchased the 1st edition, and because I wanted to have the book on my kindle.

B008JFUN6E|4.0|ELYSIUM is a highly enjoyable movie, and could not be more timely. While it falls just a bit shy of [[ASIN:B002WTOXUK District 9]]'s brilliance, it still makes for a great movie experience.<br /><br />It is the year 2154, and Earth has been divided into two classes of humans: those who \\"HAVE\\" live on the cusp of space on a gorgeous circular space station known as Elysium. Those who \\"HAVE NOT\\" are packed into the overcrowded, miserable planet of Earth, where nothing works, living conditions are miserable, and the entire planet's population are not even called \\"citizens.\\" Worse yet, medical care is miserable at best on Earth, but up on Elysium technology exists that cures any disease, instantly.<br /><br />It's no wonder everyone is trying to emigrate off the surface of the planet to get there. The only problem is that Elysium doesn't look kindly upon those who try to invade its borders, and those who attempt it often die in the process. Sure, the metaphor can be a little heavy handed at times, but if that doesn't worry you then this movie will be perfect for you.<br /><br />As far as special effects and cinematography, I loved DISTRICT 9, and I was similarly impressed with the ELYSIUM. The former film proved that director and writer Neill Blomkamp is amazing when it comes to working with seamless cinema technology, and this is a skill that is equally prominent in ELYSIUM - especially given his $100 million budget. The grainy, downtrodden worlds are extremely similar, but ELYSIUM goes one better with its depiction of the futuristic and beautiful space station - named after the mythical Hellenic afterlife realm where those who led heroic lives went to spend a careless afterlife. Blomkamp said he had to look no further than America's own Beverly Hills for his model of unapologetic boundless wealth.<br /><br />I also loved the actors: Matt Damon is terrific as always, playing the reluctant hero Max with anything BUT a heart of gold. Jodi Foster is also fine as Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt - I loved seeing her play against type as a heartless bureaucrat with an interesting accent to boot. Sharlto Copley - who played the sympathetic bumbling hero of DISTRICT 9 - tears up the screen here as Delacourt's deranged triggerman. Also of note was Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, playing a smuggler named Spider, an engaging role that allows him to be both opportunistic and ultimately humanistic.<br /><br />About the only fault I can find with the film is that ELYSIUM doesn't allow itself time to really get to the core of anything...there's little we feel we know about Damon's character other than the fact that he is perennially on the wrong side of the law. Similarly, we don't get to know anything about Secretary Delacourt - or her political counterpart President Patel - which would have been helpful, as they are continually at odds throughout the film, though we get little or no explanation why.<br /><br />What we DO get in its place is action...lots of it...especially in the second half of the film. This is enjoyable, but a little more fleshing out of the roles might have made for a little more satisfying film. DISTRICT 9 didn't have a lot of explanation behind it, either, but its spare storyline didn't need it. Here, the movie gets by on a similarly slight back story, but a little more would have helped.of Defense Jessica Delacourt - I loved seeing her play against type as a heartless bureaucrat with an interesting accent to boot.

B008CLI4N4|3.0|Game of Thrones is acceptable entertainment, but below the usual HBO standard.  It will never be confused with the excellent Lord of the Rings movies, for example.  My biggest complaint is that the pacing of the show is so slow.  Coupled with rather wooden acting by most of the cast, it can be very annoying.  If only the other actors had fed off the enthusiasm and energy that the dwarf noble  put into his performance!  I like Sean Bean, but he plays his role like Liam Neeson on downers.  The characters seem better suited to a Dickens novel than a fantasy series in my opinion--very extreme characterizations.  The productio9n values are excellent and add to the viewing experience.  If you watch this series with reasonable expectations, you will be entertained.  I had much higher hopes for it, though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it . It has so many amazing games that you can play . I think it is the best !!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I purchased this, in part, based upon reviews here. There is no doubt, not being an audiophile...well sort of, this is a great product.

I am now listening to LP's I haven't heard for years.<br />Very happy with the $99 purchase.

B007THA4FI|4.0|In the tradition of Anthony Trollope, Rowlings develops a seemingly simple situation in small town goverment into a full blown drama.  The story evolves from the various characters' reactions to the sudden death of Barry Fairweather, a man who provided support and stabilzation for many of his fellow citizens. As the story unfolds, these individuals' backgrounds and feelings are revealed.  While some unravel to the point of crash and burn, there are those whose dignity is preserved or restored. I particularly enjoyed the author's technique of revealing, largely through internal monologue, the inner lives and feelings of not only the adults but the adolescents of the town.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Excellent, more mature work of Baldacci, an author I already love. Will Robie, the protagonist in this one, is more complexly drawn than some of Baldacci's characters, and extremely interesting. There are some other characters who are also quite compelling, and most of them are women -- almost unheard-of for Baldacci. The story still rolls along in the same way that fans have come to expect, so &#34;The Innocent&#34; is a great read on multiple levels. I definitely recommend it highly.

0321885112|4.0|This is a great way to quickly get acclimatized and jump into sketchnoting. In the past I have notoriously taken poor notes, trying to focus on capturing any and everything the speaker was talking about. Framing note taking in pictures helps create design limitations on what you can put down and portray with a picture forcing you to focus on the key statements. Additionally, you're searching for ways to convey this message with pictures which also helps in giving it a more permanent seed in your memory. I've always been able to draw, this helped to take that ability and allow it to help in areas I really didn't think it had business being there. Well done.

B000SEFCD8|5.0|This is not a &#34;how to&#34; book, but it is a book you should read if you want to have a dog (or even a cat). The author looks at communication in humans and canines and how we can potentially misunderstand each other. Really, it's a phenomenal book and has fundamentally changed the way I go about interacting with my pets. It's also easy to read and light hearted while still well-researched.

I highly recommend all his publications to photographers who are just beginning to get serious about the art - knowing he and his staff will make the experience of taking and processing photographs so much more enjoyable for them.

Many thanks, Scott, Matt and the rest of team Kelby.

This novel is no different, it throws characters you've known throughout her novels into completely different light. You can't find a more compelling writer of historical fiction.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|I don't I think that there is any room left for improvement... Can't get any better than this! Creative, powerful, moving and original.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The book has a very academic approach but at the same time easy to understand. Gary Taubes treats the subject very thorough.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This movie shows the humorist side of Lincoln and the struggles/sacrifices he made to create change in our country's history.  I enjoyed the way the story developed and the focus on the side not typically portrayed in historical books that briefly cover his life.
B007ZYJT1U|3.0|I was curious about this movie because it was &#34;best picture&#34; in Great Briton. Hmm.. be prepared to learn about some interesting characters. I ain't happy.
B007WULJ5G|3.0|everyone freaked out about this movie....OMG IT'S SOOOOO NASTY...THAT PART WITH THE BABY (valley girl voice). yeah ok ohhh ahhh nasty (though the son was worse, but saw that coming a mile away).....otherwise it was friggin boring as hell.<br />Story lines (yes lines) firstly how far is one man willing to go to be set for life? that guy, ex-porn star living a miserable boring life being offered to do &#34;art&#34; and be set for life. Second story line, the fine lines between art, porn, snuff, and violence. It's a rather blurry line and is ultimately in the eye of the beholder. But that's a different story that I can't type enough for that.<br /><br />I've seen some pretty messed up stuff. Everyone told me ohhh it's pale in comparison to Serbian Film, watched it, fast forward through a lot of it, called it a mile away, no surprises, nothing. Maybe it was the hype?<br /><br />Long story short, save your money, it's not worth it. You'll watch it once, wish you never saw it (in a good or bad way) and it will sit on your shelf where everyone will question it. you tell them about it and then you'll be subjected to it again. Maybe you'll be lucky and someone will keep it or steal it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story was good, but I had problems when they jumped around in time and introduced new characters. I wasn't sure who was who for awhile there. It all came together in the end.
B003AYMZO2|4.0|Great way to catch up and refresh before viewing the next season episodes.  If you are viewing this you are already caught up in this great series.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had the Chromecast for about a week now, and despite a few little hiccups have been incredibly impressed and pleased.  Considering the price, I feel like this is a no-brainer purchase if you enjoy streaming shows from Netflix, clips on Youtube, and/or movies out of Google's store.<br /><br />Setup was a little more complicated than I was expecting.  I have a dual-band router, both with the same hidden SSID.  The Chromecast has an option to enter in your hidden SSID so it seemed like there'd be zero issue.  Entered it correctly, verified, and it just couldn't find my network.  I went back and tried a few times, thinking I must have been fat-fingering a button.  No luck.  I un-hid my 5ghz SSID, tried connecting, no luck.  It only worked after exposing the SSID on both 2.4 and 5ghz bands before it would connect.  Somewhere on the device page it says it does work with 2.4ghz hidden SSIDs, and I may try re-naming that band and hiding the 5ghz again.  But I hear that's not actually too terrible a thing to break through if somebody's actually seeking to get in so I might not even worry about it.<br /><br />Anyway, once setup, it's worked great with my HTC One.  Finding content through Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube on your phone is so much more convenient and intuitive than searching on the apps on your TV, or 360, etc.  Basically - any box where you have to fumble with a remote to do searching and navigation, this is better than.  You kick off a movie/clip, cast it to your TV, and the phone is free to do whatever else you want while the content plays.  At any time you can get back into the casting app and pause/resume content.  Super slick.<br /><br />I tried out the casting extension on my chrome browser, and it works about like you'd expect.  You can cast a tab, and all content on that tab is sent to your TV.  Works reasonably well for me, and I can definitely see the use cases (photo sharing, watching things you can't get to through the other mediums you have).I tried streaming a movie through my Amazon Prime account, and while it worked, the audio wasn't 100% synced up.  And of course if you want it full-screen, you have to give up your laptop while the movie plays.  Also - my laptop (retina MBP) got really hot, and really noisy.  My recommendation would be to not expect to use this feature on a regular basis for streaming content.<br /><br />One other downside I noticed is that while casting a netflix movie, the netflix screen takes up the entirety of my lock screen.  I received a phone call, and the phone was ringing but the caller information was missing, as were the 'Answer' and 'Ignore' buttons.  Had to \\"back\\" out of the netflix info (which is just weird on the lock screen to have to do) before they showed up.  Google Play Movies did not have this problem, yet still allowed you to pause/resume from the lock screen.<br /><br />Anyway - I really can't recommend this thing enough.  It isn't perfect, but it's also not expensive enough to expect perfection.  If you like Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play content to be on your TV, this is the easiest and cheapest way to get it there.  If you have other ways to get it there, this is still a worthy investment as it's infinitely more pleasing to use than a TV-remote based application.<br /><br />Very, very pleased.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|On most apps to get this kind of app u must buy one, but not this fun game. I really hope u like this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read Khaled Hosseini's previous novels. Therefore I had great expectations for And the Mountains Echoed.  He is an extremely gifted writer who paints masterpiece pictures with his words. His characters come alive on the pages and weave their way into a magnificent story. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I think it would make a great book club book.
1490313370|5.0|This contains a LOT of advice --  not just for business seekers.  It contains so much more.  A very good read for up-and-coming youth, too!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wonderful puzzles.  Thoroughly entertaining.  Kept me guessing the entire time. I hope there's more Rooms to come.  Can't wait for the next one.
B00002SWEM|5.0|I bought this for my wife, who is Cuban. We both enjoyed it very much. This is good for anyone who can appreciate the old Cuban musicians and the incomparable rhythm of their music.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|This movie definitely should be in anyone's all time top ten. Bogart is pretty much flawless. Ingrid Bergman is also exceptional.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This is great post-apocalyptic fun for the whole family!<br />Noah Wylie still has &#34;it&#34; (I wondered what happened to him after ER!).<br /><br />The actors work well together, there's lots of good chemistry and a strong story.
B00132S74A|5.0|Very suspenseful.  Enjoyed the personal interactions and the history. Well researched and documented.  I always enjoy Ken Follett's writing style.
B00846REIS|4.0|I love the connection between Eva and Gideon. Could not put this book down!cannot wait to read the next book to see what's heading their way!
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|The critics seemed to hate this movie, claiming it was a rip-off of sci-fi classics such as &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; and &#34;1984&#34;, but I disagree.  While it may have paid homage to those and possibly the new classic of the time &#34;The Matrix&#34;, it stands on it's own.  It is unique enough to have it's own message.  The action, while sparse, is intense and fun to watch.  Christian Bale, as usual, gives a good performance.  Taye Diggs does a pretty good job in his limited screen time as well.  All in all, an enjoyable piece of work from writer/director Kurt Wimmer (writer of &#34;Law Abiding Citizen&#34;).

B007FEFLTO|3.0|not as good as book 1 slow beginning good finish but abrupt probably to set up book 3 as expected
159562015X|4.0|Is a part of a test to get your strengths.  After doing the test this book gives a more details about all the strengths (And then the strength you does not have). The results are about 80% right, but the upper strength tells something about your strengths.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I did not want to put it down. It was a good, quick read.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I surely think so. This is by far my favorite Vietnam movie. And for those that think that the first 1/2 hour is all Hollywood fiction, think again. I Served in the Airborne Special Forces and I can assure you booth camp is every bit as depicted here!
B0081336FO|5.0|great acting, fun,, but some are a little scary for our 11 year old.  We have watched this as a family but had to turn a few episodes off.
B00006ADD5|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband....we both love epic movies and 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the best ever made!!<br />The disk is new in a sealed wrapper, arrived quickly, and was a great price!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Proper suspense throughout with very few \\"slow\\" episodes...can't wait for the next season to come for more great Walking Dead action
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|The game is setup in such away that to speed up gameplay you need to spend cash what a waste of what could be a fairly cool game.
B0000029J5|5.0|This is Keb's first cd and is a replacement of one previously owned. I feel it is overall the best cd he has put out. There are some great songs on other cds but not one where I have enjoyed every song on it like this one. If you want to try this artist, you can't go wrong with this cd.
B004VFN7BE|4.0|Good sit on the edge of your seat film.  Weaver and Holly Hunter were great.  I'm never scared being home alone, but made sure every thing was locked up and slept with my sidearm after watching this one.

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Situation:  cyclist needs extended iPhone battery power for 6 to 7 hours of GPS tracking and map display.<br />Outcome: successful result with Anker Astro Slim3 6000mAh Lithium External Battery.<br />Details: Surveyed the market, many manufacturers and external battery solutions. Spoke directly to a representative at Anker for a very useful consult, a big factor in my buying decision. Chose this new model at her suggestion and now enjoying excellent results. The Astro Slim3 delivers power for the duration of very long rides and is packaged in a case that fits well in a medium-sized seat bag along with the other necessary road tools. Well designed product.  Happy customer.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|I will state what the film is NOT before I critique it.  It is not a smash bang shoot everything that moves film and the zombies don't appear in the ice cream store !  In essence this will leave a major faction of our society totally confused and lost. The film IS is a very deep and credible sociological study of the human experience meant to elicit recognition of the human spirit in its many reincarnations.  Hanks is a brilliant actor and has made several films that caused the audience to stop and actually contemplate the message he intended to give. In this story he has gone beyond expectation and with a memorable cast has accomplished a masterpiece.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|if you not ready to get addicted to a game...don't play this...its the bomb! nemo for the win I love Disney yah

B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|Not high drama by today's standards either. However, it's a well-acted look at tragic Toulouse Lautrec, a wealthy and profoundly disabled artist whose degenerate lifestyle revolved around the sleazy Moulin Rouge subculture. The set designs and costuming alone make this a classic film.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It's so good! Awesome story! Easy to follow. Keeps you guessing but in a good way! Elizabeth I applaud you!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Like other Kanye albums, i've grown to like it. At first I thought it was odd and too &#34;out there,&#34; but the more I listen to it, the more I like it. Blood on the leaves is a poignant song with great beats.
0205313426|3.0|This was recommended to me.  I haven't used to it.  I guess it's okay but I don't find it particularly useful.
B008602KQI|3.0|I wasn't overly impressed with the dialogue.<br /><br />I enjoyed the over-all story and creativity, but I wasn't dazzled.<br /><br />It is interesting how it trivializes life.  Maybe that is the deeper message to ponder.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The history of the greatest group ever (in my opinion) is well done & complete. Just hearing the music again males it a &#34;must&#34; buy  !

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I spent three days of my life on the series, and I do not regret it!!!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I feel like there is a decent version of this if it was re-edited. All the right pieces are in play but it seemed more like a stroll through \\"what was shot\\" rather than a complete movie. The last half hour is the only time I cared what was happening and while the mountain climbing/descent was a cool scene, it could have easily been a promotion for \\"Ka\\" (Las Vegas). A lot could have been gained by revisiting the themes from Rise of Cobra; flashbacks to scenes from the first movie would have significantly helped emphasize Cobra's grasp and any indication that they actually have power. However, all of the buildup to Cobra Commander being a complex character get completely ignored because now, as long as we show that he walks cool (and slightly femininely), he can effortlessly ride off to a moon base or elsewhere. RZA was more intimidating than any of the bad guys.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This is not written as well as his other books.  I found the story disjointed and my interest waned while reading it.  Somewhat disappointed.
B00966TN1Q|4.0|I always enjoy reading his books. Harry (Hieronimus) is an interesting character who plugs away at his case until he finds a solution.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a must have app. Suits all taste for relaxation moods.<br />We fall asleep to it every night. The kids love it too.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|I love the idea and story behind this game. Wonderful puzzles and graphics. I enjoyed it very much. I can't wait until the next one.
0738727326|5.0|The artwork in this deck is simple stunning. It speaks to me on another level and I am so glad I now own it. HOWEVER - I feel the publisher made a grave mistake with the size of the cards. They are much too small to enjoy the intricate detail of the art! I'm so disappointed with the size. Also, the paper stock is thinner than most of my decks. All of these issues are not the fault of the artist, so I am still giving this deck 5 stars. Tarot collectors - this is a MUST HAVE.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It's an easy fun read. I recommend it for teenagers & adults.  Happy with my purchase.  Started the 2nd book a couple days ago & I can't wait to see where it goes.
B009M7G1PU|4.0|In creating a review of Lady Chatterley's Lover one searches with difficulty to say something that has remained unsaid. As with much of D.H.Lawrence's work, the Nottinghamshire coal industry is of more significance to the novel than it might first appear. Both the author and one of his chief characters were sons of colliers. And it shows in Lawrence's dystopian vision, enunciated at the very start: 'Ours is essentially a tragic age...'. This 'tragic age', and how society might deal with it, was obviously meant, by Lawrence, to be central. He clearly did not count on the impact that the so-called 'purple passages'would have; not only on popular appreciation, but on scholarly interpretation, across the decades. In Britain the history of the collieries is the history of a race apart. British miners are differentiated from other elements of the working class in that they live in very close locality. In villages in the 1920s where nearly all adult males did hard, dangerous work underground, it bred the most deep-seated sense of community . Anyone who doubts any of this should read the essay 'Down the Mine' by George Orwell, contained as a chapter in 'Road to Wigan Pier'. The collective response to life's miseries, the dangers, the bronchial diseases, (to which Lawrence himself succumbed), the sense of a robotic existence in which all life is governed by the mine's hooter, to say nothing of the associated despoliation of the countryside, was to accept its concomitant financial success, the `bitch-goddess' of the novel.  To Lawrence, the only satisfactory escape is to a more pristine, pre-industrial life, whose central joy is found in human fulfilment; at its highest level in a warm and uncorrupted sexual love between two people. In `Lady Chatterley's Lover', Lawrence's last novel (far from his most acclaimed, though in a sense serving as his valedictory statement) he idealises this as between a working-class man who, through education and the army managed to escape the pits, and an upper middle-class woman, desperately afraid of the 'weird' industrial masses, who is seeking a more unrestrained life than that imposed by modern society, where in her eyes 'people were 'as mere pieces pushed around on a chessboard'. It was, in Lawrence's view, a world in which 'men were turned into nothing only labour insects, and all their manhood taken away'(p.202).Following the first world war, love across the social classes was beginning to make its appearance in Britain and, in 'Lady Chatterley's Lover', Lawrence also makes a statement in that regard too. At the 1960 trial of Penguin Books the sex scenes, as they inevitably do, take centre-stage. And there may well be much in what was claimed by his defenders, namely that Lawrence, in the use of the famous 'four-lettered words' was simply searching for a language in which physical love could be described in an ordinary value-free way.
B004NS710C|5.0|The action and the plot was very good. I was obvious that they used 2 different trains in the movie. Some scenes had one loco and other had 2 locos. But overall it was a great movie
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since I was a kid. I loved it even more in HD! It's a must watch!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Meet Sookie Stackhouse and her friends and family from Bon Temps LA as they learn to love or hate vampires who are out of the coffin.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I enjoyed the concept of the Night Circus as well as the characters and the lack of sentimentality.<br />It is a good story that is well-told.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I've been meaning to read this book for awhile and finally downloaded the sample for my kindle and read the first chapter.  It sounded like something my brother would also enjoy and I was just about to download it when I noticed that the Text to Speech ability is disabled on this book. Here's the thing--my kid brother is visually impaired and this is a really important feature for us to have, so when publishers refuse to make it available I refuse to buy the book and support their greed (they only disable it because they think they can get more money that way--wrong!). I was looking forward to reading this too, oh well. Maybe I'll check it out at the library and just read it out loud to my brother instead of buying it and giving my money to the publishers...
B008602KQI|5.0|It is rare that the movie follows the book, especially considering the special effects needed for this one.  I enjoyed the movie and all the visuals that reinforced my reading.  Thanks!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Fun game, but I'm always running out of coins.  It is disgusting to have to quit all the time due to lack of coins.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|The bumper give you just enough protection with spoiling the phones good looks and adding extra bulk like some other cases.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you entertained and eager to find out what happens next til the very last page. Full of surprises and twists .
B007V2UGPE|4.0|More entertaining that plants versus zombies. Challenging in later levels and tough to earn gold coins though, but this is my first game on my kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It was listed as free, then keeps asking you to spend money and won't let proceed with the game.. waste of time
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Good read - and the movie that came out did a great job of emulating the main character.  Looking forward to possible future movies with Reacher character - and definitely to the reading series.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is virtually a peerless author, and sees into the human heart with great ability, perhaps the best of our time.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|He is a master of story telling and this book is another adventure from the bizarre.  I really enjoyed the strange folk that march across the pages of this tale.

B00280LYIM|5.0|To me it seemed like a Movie, Every time I would look up from the book I could see the movie!!!!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I did enjoy it - a breeze to read, coming from someone who has lapsed in that area for decades and who needs something interesting to concentrate on. It is the book I was going to have to write if no one else came up with it soon.<br /><br />I found a few aspects unlikely - Aspergers people tend not to like exotic and unusual foods, so the lead character Don's gourmet dinners did not convince me. He also changes, which is not likely to continue beyond snaring his mate, but suffices for the purposes of the book.<br /><br />Otherwise it was entertaining and enjoyable to see how the character related to his world and missed his social cues, and went about solving a problem in a manner he saw as perfectly reasonable.<br /><br />It would be lovely to now get additional titles to make up a series, such as Don's earlier life, then what happens in the marriage. Mr Simsion should get cracking on it.<br /><br />[I chose this book because it was mentioned on Raf's segment on Melbourne Radio 774, and I then saw it was about an Aspergers male. I like to watch movies and read books about Aspergers, and see whether the author, director or actor has any true grip on the syndrome.]
B002XMGGK6|5.0|In the beginning it was a little gross for me.  Then it was a real good movie.  We watched it 5 times .
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This unusual novel presents a story of a &#34;cellophane man,&#34; who engages in a hundreds of mile walk to save the life of a colleague from decades ago.  The man has many tragedies in his life, but is the good sort who bears infirmities cheerfully.  Some of the events are difficult to believe, but the novel entertains & provides fruit for book club discussion about family & marital relationships.  The many British expressions were a treat for comparison with similar ones from America.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I purchased the galaxy tab 2 for my husband first for our anniversary.  After dabbling with his for a while I decided to get one for myself.  It is easy to set up  (I'm not a computer geek). Even setting up to print was easy  (need a wirless printer). Just love it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was beautifully written and a totally different aspect on Germany in WW2. The narration is ever so clever. An absolute page turner to find out more about the book thief.
B00E9Q6H1C|5.0|A great story of friendship and growing up,I love howthe story is integrated with the present.So wonderfully written.I would watch it again and again and again,oh did I say I'd watch it again?
B001P06GX4|5.0|I love Blockus because it is easy to pick up and go. The rules are not extremely complicated but every game is completely unique. My only concern with the game is that it has some extremely small and easily lost pieces. If you purchase the game then be ready to keep your eyes peeled when someone spills out the pieces.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This multigenerational novel realistically details life in this poor war-torn country.  The family members are compelling, and the structure is ingenious.  The novel begins with a fairy tale which morphs into the lives of the characters in the book.  This is one of the best novels I have read recently.  The author can structure a story & advance a plot worth dialogue.  The reader will be enmeshed in the life, plight, and success of the characters.  Highly recommend.
B000002KY8|5.0|i was happy with this cd. product came in a timely fashion and was just as described when i purchased it.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|The movie fascinates me watching how the actors change throughout.  There was a problem with the movie however.  It was grainy and I am fairly certain by how it played that it was a very poor copy.  I was disappointed not in the movie but the item that I purchased from Amazon.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|This woman goes beyond a fusion blend of \\"Old Time\\" music styles.  She has created a category all her own. When I listened to this album I thought this is \\"New Time\\" music.  Her music has history and soul and is fresh all at the same time.  I can't wait to see what comes next!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good characters and stories, great acting. A couple characters are too \\"bad-ass\\" to be entirely believable, but delightful never-the-less!<br />I think everyone will find at least one character to love and one to hate!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Poor format. Not enough info to be useful. WeatherBug seems to be a much more useful tool to monitor the weather
B000002L68|5.0|I was happy with this cd. The product arrived when it was supposed to and was just as it was described when purchased.
B009WUBERW|5.0|I was happy they made fun of their old movies. Sly Stallone looks like he still works out 10 hours a day. It was an impossible movie for reality but who cares. If you like shoot m up and silly dialogue you will love this movie too.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This series is quickly becoming one of my favorites. If you are looking for an interesting sci-do series that keeps your interests and also engages your mind in philosophical questions about the universe and mankind, then look no further.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|Fast-paced and fun, I was able to blow through this one afternoon while my kids were napping.  The characters were written very playfully but with obvious thoughtful intent.  I was very impressed by the use of technological and scientific knowledge while keeping the overall of the narrative very tongue and cheek.  All in all, a good first showing.  I look forward to Book 2.
B00005NTJM|4.0|.... and the beginning of a great, slightly different rock band that was about to undergo great changes over their next 3 recordings.<br /><br />Tull can still play blues, but not as well as on this record.<br /><br />Someday, perhaps will we be saddened to see their final recording...  \\"We Were\\" ?
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|I love the narrative and how it draws you in. The only thing I don't like is how they draw it out.<br />45 min per episode and they give little info per episode, and by the time it's up, I'm watching the next for more data.<br />It's sucking my time
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's very cute. It repeats back everything that you say accurately. I would let it do some things for free though.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very fun.  I love playing this game.  I love the minions in this game.  I would like to see a few more levels in this game, though.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Very well laid out and easy to use. Liked the text option and over all it worked well. The main con is that it gives you only one option to send via Facebook. That is unless I missed something. Work around for me was to take a screen shot and let Drop Box pick it up.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|Okay for short entertainment,  You only draw with it, not much else. Glad it was a free app.  Don't think I would want to pay for it.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|You need to add this to your collection of TTB music if you don't already have it. It is one of my favorite albums and I am excited for the new album that is soon to be released!!
B0006IEVFG|2.0|The watch isn't bad, but I don't use all the functions.  I just like having a watch without a battery.  The face is a nice shape and easy to read.  But the night light is too dim and the band is way too short.  I am an elderly man, not that heavy, and I can only get the band to the second notch.  Not enough band left to put through the retaining loop.  I will probably get another watch to replace this.
B008MM9630|4.0|Well. I love  the game!! It's nice sweet and I love how you can be a type of character. But. You sometimes have to buy stuff with real money and I have no intention of doing so. I like it a lot
B001JIFYSA|5.0|When you feel like crap, having this movie available for instant download is imperative. Because it makes you feel better. Just like chicken noodle soup.
B004T32SOK|5.0|The package arrive as promised. I purchased this watch for my wife. She has been asking for one in Rose Gold and I liked the style and Lifetime Warranty. When I opened it up, it is more attractive than on the web. I am sure she will love it. I just home it wears well.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|Not my favorite sci-fi, but not terrible either. If you don't like non-linear plot lines this is not the book for you.
B003VS0CKG|4.0|Easy to read, complete and full of very useful examples.<br />Recommended for everyone wanting to know a more about Language Teaching methods without much linguistic jargon.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|really frustrated, every thing else was smooth running, this is the first app i encountered that does not run, which never happened on my apple devices, money wasted for the first time in my life.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|A+++++ ..... Would totally buy this Talking Dog App again. Cannot wait for Talking Ben The Dog 2.<br /><br />Also - I will upgrade to the paid version.
B004I654WQ|5.0|I do too.  The BD stays in the house on the shelf next to the blu-ray player and the DVD goes in the minivan to be used on long trips.  I love BD/DVD combo packs like this.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|This season has it's ups and downs, but overall, worth watching.  Be prepared to be mad at the characters at points!
B008742O32|5.0|Couldn't believe that an app could show me all this one could. It gives you a very nice and easy screen on you PC where you can investigate all you have on your Android phone, including the contacts. AirDroid is very simple to use and is very professionally made. The screen on the PC or Laptop is easy to use for everyone. Get it, you won't be disappointed.
B0053TWW1I|5.0|I watch this movie over and over again just to see Grace's Katrina strip performance and it never fails to have an affect on me.so glad I now own a copy of this.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this series!!  Cannot get enough . . .  The characters are great, good story lines, funny but also makes you think.  The clothes the ladies wear are beautiful and I wish I worked at the firm with them!  The clothes are much better than on Mad Men, just sayin; . . .
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I got this on the kindle edition and read it.  I work as a Network Engineer for a SaaS company where we are closely tied to DEV/QA and trying to develop a continuous deployment cycle.  This book really helped to put into perspective where IT sits in a company and what our focus should be.
B0058W74UY|2.0|didnt work on my phone, took forever to download and all for it not to change a thing. a bit frustrated
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|.You have already reviewed I Know Sousa, Not Sopranos! A Survival Guide for the Band Director Teaching Choirs You have already reviewed I Know Sousa, Not Sopranos! A Survival Guide for the Band Director Teaching Choirs
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was the first book of the Reacher story. The introduction by Mr. Child explains how and why Reacher is (and became) Reacher. If you like Reacher, the introduction alone is worth the price of this book.
B000FC1RCI|3.0|I have to admit, I read it all in one or two days because it was an easy read that kept your attention and interest.  However, I wish the book had a little more ideas, a bit more meaning.  Is that too much to ask even of a mystery, and supposedly one of the best mysteries ever?  I think authors should really communicate some \\"ideas\\" in their novels, whether on life, death, spirituality, human relationships ... and this book just lacked that.  Potential ideas that were not really developed include how people deal with fear and prospect of death, justice, and conscience.  Anyway, I don't think it's too much to ask for some ideas and themes from such a world-renowned author and book.
B008M0NDOK|2.0|Thanks god I bought it with $9 because it's definitely not worth that much.<br />I bought this device only for shooter games such as Modern Combat and N.O.V.A, so my review is based on the compatibility with shooter games.<br />The design is from 3 generations ago. It's very old and not suitable for shooter games. It's like playing Nintendo Famicon Family.<br />The buttons are OK except the analogs, They are hard to press and you'll hurt your fingers few mins after using them.<br />It doesn't have L2,R2 like Playstaion and Xbox so that probably will make it not easy for you.<br />The compatibility with other games is very poor. It supports only 8 games from Gameloft and it doesn't support Modern Combat 4!.<br />So finally this device is good for arcade games if you have Blutrol from cydia.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|We got the movie in a decent amount of time but when it came the cover of the series was bent and ripped and on the inside the case was broken in some places. Plastic was rolling around with all the  discs, we were scared they may have been ruined but thankfully all the discs were fine.
B0002S94OS|5.0|One of the best Lamb of God albums of all time! If you like Lamb of God this is a must have, will have you headbanging to it even when your not actually listening!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie makes me believe in real love felt not seen. I can never get enough of it.thank youfor fulfilling my need.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Rowell nailed it! From the music to the clothes and the teenage angst, I loved this book! I was 15 in 1986 and that could have been my school, my neighborhood. The developing friendship between Eleanor and Park kept me up a couple of late nights and only a couple because I finished the book so quickly. The plot synopsis given describes the book well enough so I'll skip it. I am recommending this book to all my reader friends!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Addicting and intelligent game... sometimes it's hard to stop playing. Therapeutic after a long days work, tends to calm me down actually.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is by far my fave. I would recommend this game to all to play. Download this awesome game now! Addictive.....Love it!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book took me back in time.  It took me through an emotional journey.  It is well written and captivating.  I read it in three days.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I cried the first time I saw this movie and felt it needed to be in my I beef to feel loved section of my collection. I am toatlly satisfiedhappy face.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Makes us want to visit the UK to see the castle it was shot in. Acting is wonderful and characters are enjoyable
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it! The options they have is are so fun. It's the new Temple run but with minions, way better
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game was recommended by many of my family members.I like this game.  It is fun and easy! Bright and colorful!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Fun game. Has a little strategy but is basically a luck of the roll game. Fast pace. I like that games pieces are wood rather than plastic. And the board can change for every round. Suggest playing a few games to work out the unclear rules.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you like games that you have to find hidden items this is a good one. So what if you have to wait for your energy to build up,you don't have to spend money on it.Enjoy doing something else while you wait.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't pit it down. Wanted to keep on reading, loved all the twists and turns of fate. Recommend to all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is not the best minecraft version ever but is totally worth the money it takes to buy the game. I recommend the game to almost everyone on the face of the earth. But they update it way to slowly.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|one of my favorite shows ever still watch tell this day, can wait for the new series to start again
1583334386|5.0|Kelly...thanks so much for your energetic and fun perspective on change! In my work with folks in lifestyle modification and awareness, this has been a goldmine of information and encouragement! Thank you so much!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Moriaty. The characters were believable.the twist and turns we're believable and I could relate to their actions. It is definitely a book that can be read again.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This app is pretty fun! The only downside is having a limited amount of games.  I was hoping that you would get unlimited (that would make it A LOT better) but hey, is kind of awesome :)
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie and I highly recommend watching it! It has a very unique story line and is very exciting.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thank you Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan. I bid farewell to a world and people I have shared many hours with. I am enriched by the experience.
B009NY43NY|4.0|You can't please everyone, writing so many books and finally ending a long running series, but I enjoyed how Charlaine Harris ended her series.  I thought it was fitting.
B00785P2QC|3.0|cool game .. i like to play it nd create my dream town ..i like the fact even if i dnt play im still making money over night !
B00DI75SWM|5.0|This app is great for kids. We even made one for my grandma with cancer the keep calm said: keep calm and get rid of your cancer. She loved it. I just wish u could save them. Hope you get it. It's not a waste of money!
B00821PCJS|4.0|Pretty cool show my buddies and I watched season 1 all in one day! ahah and  a couple days later we watched all of season 2. Looking forward to the third season!
0307276902|3.0|I listened to this as an audio book. My experience with the story may differ from people who read the physical book.<br /><br />I honestly don't know exactly how to rate this book. It was interesting and captivating while at the same time being disturbing and disgusting. The first part of the book when Frey is piecing together how he got into rehab and his injuries and subsequent recovery, I wanted to puke a couple of times (which is not suggested while driving). Overall, I found it very intriguing. I've never done any of the things Frey was describing (I'm rather a square) and I don't know anyone personally who has been through anything like that either.<br /><br />The writing was a bit annoying at times with the way he repeated things for emphasis, but at other times the repetition drove home what was happening. I'm on the fence about how effective and necessary it was to the story.<br /><br />Yes, there has been controversy surrounding this story since he was on Oprah Winfrey's show and she called him out on elaborating on the story and putting things in that didn't really happen to him. So, I read it more as a \\"things that have probably happened to someone at some point, but maybe not all happened to this one man at the same time.\\"<br /><br />If you can read it with an open mind and accept that it might not all be exactly true, but that the situations are real it's a very interesting and engaging book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun and I teaches me how to do a lot I mean a lot of things about horses and I learns how to take care . Of them soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cooooooooooooooooooooooool
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|The movie failed to make me care about the characters or the story line. I can't believe I am saying this but I would rather watch vampires that glitter in the sun that watch this movie again.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|If you hate the loading sign do not get this app! That is what you will see when you go on the YouTube videos . For the first few time's it might work  but I don't think you will like it . That is why I rated it 1 star and that 0 was not a choice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So accurate to pc version it was worth a little bit less thigh but sill very cool all my cousin's hog it sometimes even my friends at my school.
0439023513|5.0|It was all that I expected, and more for the price.  Will buy from them again.  I was as good as new what  a savings
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie is great fun for the whole family it's something I can watch with my mom dad and little sister
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I have always enjoyed One Rebulic's music. It is well produced and I think most of the songs are going to be on the top 40 charts.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I got this to own my skills in magic and it works a very similar game without the need of a second person which was useful since I don't get out much
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. A must see over and over and over again. Never get bored of this movie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Thank you so much for the free app it works so wll and a great addittion to my Kindle Fire HD.  Thank you so much
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the bestestest game EVER!!!!!!!!!! TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!  :D buy w world of goo NOW!!!!!! It's challenging but super duper fun and addictive. It's also nice because if ur stuck on a level u can skip it a d come back to it later.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I love every cd by them not my favorite band but definitely my top 5 of all time great music no doubt
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My 12-year-old listens to this CD all the time.  I have no more words to describe this CD. Good bye.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved this series.  My only dislike is the Mathew died.  I am particularly happy that Mr. Bates was found not guilty and released from prison.
B00932A4XE|5.0|This is a great portrayal of modern parents and their various expectations of pregnancy and parenting.  If covers the full gamut of easy pregnancy to adoption and both parents' roles.  I loved the fathers' &#34;club&#34;!  I am a grandmother 10 times now and have watched our children go through some of the same scenarios. :)
B00004XPPE|5.0|A squadron of nuclear armed bombers is scrambled accidentally to bomb Moscow by a mechanical error.  Henry Fonda plays the President trying to recall the bombers and avoid WW3.  Walter Matthau plays one of the Presidents advisors trying to convince him to not recall the planes and sent the rest of the bombers to catch the Soviets by surprise and finally end the Cold War in a sneak attack.  You won't believe the ending !
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I liked this dictionary because it has all the words that I need to look up when I need to I think that it is very helpful.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|No, this isn't Spielberg's best work and the monster aspect of it was incredibly lame; but I was entertained by the boys and their film-making exploits. The interaction and dialogue between the friends is hysterical. I would watch it again if there was nothing else on.
B005HEPIDS|4.0|It was interesting show, but not quite up to Next Generation standards on the script side. Had to beat Patrick Stewart when it comes to acting.  Kate Mulgrew was good, but she had a hard act to follow. Rest of cast ok, and Picardo was great.
B0094K1K42|3.0|This is not one of her better movies.  She pulls the part off very well but I did not enjoy the story line.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|My grandson loves this movie and I thought I had it but had the second one instead so when I got this one he cant get enough of both movies.  Thanks
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I won't bother getting into whether it happened or not. What matters is the terror inflicted on this family of seven by demonic forces after they move into an old house.  Paranormal investigators and exorcists, the Warrens, help the family deal with the horror.<br />I am still not sure if it needed to be rated R but younger kids should definitely not see it.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My grandson, who will be 3 years old next month, absolutely loves Dr. Panda's Restaurant.  He likes the idea of beating the eggs and mixing the ingredients together.  He especially likes the cheering and confetti that accompanies the completion of the meals.  Right now the free version has more than enough for him, but I imagine that he might like the variety of the paid version in the future.  The graphics and audi are excellent.
