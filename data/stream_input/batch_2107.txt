B007J4T2G8|4.0|Cant find the second part to buy in my kindle. I would like to continue reading and only find real books, no kindle books. Dont know why
B006BQNJR8|3.0|decent action, crap story. starts out great endings just ok! love the game of thrones badass and the orgin of his story but it fizzles towards the end.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I found this application to be all as stated.  To my surprise I forgot and turned off my device after setting a wake-up alarm, however it still worked I was awakened  with a gentle alarm to start my day.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Thought it was a well done movie, with accurate depiction of the time.<br />Very intense too.  Kept me watching and on the edge of my seat, as<br />well as educated me about the time.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|Does exactly what it says.  However, be aware that the resolution on your tablet screen may not match that on your computer screen, making it a bit difficult in some situations to do what you would like.  This is, after all, a limitation of the technology rather than the product
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Braveheart is a great movie for anyone looking to watch a great movie. Plain and simple, watch it if yoy havent already.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|Nothing really new, possibly the whole girl not wanting to commit is a slightly new twist. It was just alright. Laughed a couple of times, teared up once, so not a complete waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I got the game but I couldn't go into the game it wouldn't let me in ..I got rid of it and got it back again but it still didn't let me into this stupid game
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|The villains were handle in a very comic-booky way, that is to say, without much depth on screen. But the story was beautifully told, well acted, and even the briefest characters added to the story and the pleasure of watching.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is one of the best alien invasion series I've seen. It has great story line and action.  The twist of the aliens rebelling adds to the complexity.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Amazon still hasn't worked out its cloud server interface as well as they should, and they utterly ignore the needs of people like me who want it to handle podcasts (which iTunes does do)
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It was a good story. I didn't foresee where it was going. I liked the plot it was just out of my age level. Love the defining twisted moment.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|One of the most engrossing books I've ever read.  Could not put it down.  Easy to read but full of life lessons for all.  The young protagonist sees complex events with an amazing clarity.  His search for the killer of a dog named Wellington ends up being so much more.  Loved it.
0143123173|5.0|My late father-in-law would have been trying to sneak this book away from me, if he hadn't read it first.  Craig Johnson's crime-mystery tales from Absaroka County give you twists, turns, and strong characters you can really sink your teeth into. My idea of a great book is when the author can draw you in, make you care about what happens to the characters, and not want to put the book down until you do find out.  Mr. Johnson succeeds, and then some.  His work is also VERY carefully researched, and he lives where his characters do.  This is no city boy conjuring up cowboy cop fantasy. It's real, modern, and FEELS real.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great show.  I missed it when it was on but watched after seeing Serenity in the theatres.  I don't watch many shows more than once but after multiple viewings this series consistently can put a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes or make me laugh out loud. Everyone that I have recommended this show to has thanked me after they watched it. Video storytelling at it's best.
B0095VPAVE|3.0|I bought this CPU as part of a new system to replace my older Core 2 Duo router that was beginning to show its age. This newer CPU performs much better than the older C2D part, but it's still not going to win any speed award.<br /><br />Despite AMD claiming this is a &#34;quad core&#34; APU, it really isn't. It has two Piledriver &#34;modules&#34; that have some duplicate core functionality that allows each core to process two threads. It's very similar to the Hyperthreading scheme from Intel used on the older Pentium 4s. In certain multi-threaded scenarios, the APU performs well, but single thread performance isn't that great.<br /><br />I did some brief testing with the 7550D IGP and it performs well for what it is. It will run older Source engine based games at medium settings well and float between 40-80 FPS at 1280x1024 depending on how much stuff is being rendered. I haven't tested any newer games though; But using the Hybrid Crossfire with a discrete HD7xxx card should improve performance, especially on newer games.<br /><br />The two problems that I've had with this APU are the high heat output and the awful heatsink/fan. While the APU is idle, the included cooling solution is fine, but under a moderate load and above, it can't handle the heat output and the APU quickly starts overheating. The heatsink is this awful poor quality and fragile aluminum and weighs about as much as a small stack of paper. The fan is equally bad and is really noisy, even at low speeds. It reminds me of mid 1990s era SCSI hard drives with bearing noise. It also barely moves any air through the heatsink, further exacerbating the overheating problem.<br /><br />While this APU has its flaws, I'd recommend it for building a cheap machine for the kids, office machines or media machines. Though I would recommend trashing the included cooler and getting something like a Hyper 101a/TX3, or a slim cooler for smaller cases. I'd also make sure you have plenty of airflow in your case, especially slim cases.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I had actually listened to the short audio clips on Amazon, and found them quite good, without actually turning on to them. It was only when I was encouraged to listen to the album in its whole that it dawned on me: The Beach Boys have made another classic album.<br /><br />You almost forget that it's been more than forty years since the group finally delivered a really good album; and rarely has a Beach Boys album been so consistently well written. The vocals are surprisingly strong. Brian does not sound like he did in the 1960s, but Jeffrey Foskett does a convincing job on the high harmonies and Brian's lead vocals are still strong, but in a different way. Al Jardine has hardly sung with more conviction than he does on the fine \\"From There to Back Again\\". The harmony vocals are generally very tight and it is difficult to distinguish the individual voices, but pure Beach Boys sound as no other group has managed to create.<br /><br />The songwriting is, as mentioned, superb. There are more songs written in the Pet Sounds / Smile style with beautiful choral voices - acapella or with very sparse arrangements. For example. \\"Think About the Days\\" which works very much the same way as \\"Our Prayer\\" did on \\"Smile\\" - also \\"From There to Back Again\\" and \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" fall into this category, and these songs show evidence that Brian Wilson still manages to write sangs at once complex and melodic.<br /><br />In the more immediately catchy category you will find a handful of potential hits / classics such as the title track \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\". Classic Beach Boys sound - shamelessly catchy. \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\", with its Carrebean beat and strong chorus is another bid for a new classic.<br /><br />\\"Beaches in Mind\\" - may seem a little sketchy - but must be fantastic live-song - again a strong chorus. \\"Is not it Time\\" has a bit of the same beat as \\"Do It Again\\" - and a great build-up. \\"Strange World\\" is a really nice pop ballad. I imagine there will be many cover versions of this particular number. Not very much a typical Beach Boys number - great nonetheless.<br /><br />The album has the classic slot length of about 40 minutes - a perfect length when all the songs are so listenable. I have played the album at random several times and the numbers work incredibly well together anyway.<br /><br />The only thing you may miss is a few powerful lead vocals from Carl Wilson - glory be to his memory - otherwise you get more than could reasonably have been expected from a band that has been on the road for 50 years.e will be many cover versions of this particular number.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved the concept, the narrative, the execution. I hated that I didn't get to sleep until 2am  on 3 consecutive nights.  Most highly recommend this book!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great writer! Amazing story!  One that I will definitely read again. And one where the I'm sure the movie can never be as good as the book...
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Exquisite writing. Brilliant storyline. Beautiful on all accounts. A classic love story set among the tragedy of death. Love prevails.
B001QFZADA|5.0|I highly recommend this book for singles. I gave it to my daughter who is in her 20's. Lots of insight on how to develop and maintain relationships .
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|it used to be amazing! I would use it for everything! then after about four months, it started to glitchcand I would have to restart it every time I wanted to type one word. it wouldn't let me see what I was typing after a while and I had to keep refreshing to see if it would work... please fix the problem!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is beautiful is so many ways.  The plotlines are captivating and expertly woven.  The music sounds majestic.  The costumes are gorgeous.  The acting is flawless at almost every turn.  And the scenery....well, it speaks for itself!  If you love historical fiction, as I do, Downton Abbey is for you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very well organized, very smartly written<br />A very good suspense that keeps you excited.<br />This book is a serious, brilliant,  psychological thriller.<br /><br />Romy Shenhar, MA
B009KYXEY6|1.0|While I love the music, the CD is missing the bonus tracks for disc one. This is pretty much false advertising and I really feel ripped off.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|When I wrote a Pink Floyd's review called \\"Fans can't think with reason\\", several people complained, as it was expected. But I'm sure I was right. And look that I was talking about a Pink Floyd's album that is way, way better than this one.<br /><br />First, I love Rush! I have all Rush's albums, all, obviously all in vinyl(Superior Media), because CD is not music!<br /><br />I can like Vapor Trails, and I can like Snakes And Arrows too, but I listened to this one three times, I tried, but I have to say, WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!<br /><br />I will never understand why groups don't avoid to release a new album, when they feel they are not inspired to compose really good songs.<br /><br />Who between us are not thirsty for listening such a powerful songs like Red Barchetta, Freewill, or Limelight? Even Armor And Sword is way superior than any song in this album.<br /><br />Pay attention, this one is the worst Rush's album ever! I have no doubt, not even a single brilliant moment, not even a single moving moment we Rush's fans are so get used to.<br /><br />I've felt nostalgic missing albums like Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Roll The Bones, Counterparts, Hold Your Fire, Presto, Test for Echo. And Notice that none of the best rush's albums are in this list, All of them have moments of absolute, absolute brilliance, and amazing musicianship.<br /><br />Moments of absolute brilliance: S. Robert Todd's opinion.<br />Signals: The Analog Kid, Chemistry, The Weapon, Countdown.<br />Grace Under Pressure: After Image, Between The Wheels.<br />Power Windows: The Big Money, Manhattan Project, Territories.<br />Roll The Bones: Timeline, Bravado, The Big Wheel, Heresy, Ghost of a Chance, Neurotica, You Bet Your Life.<br />Counterparts: Nobody's Hero, Between sun and Moon, The Speed of Love.<br />Presto: Chain Lightning, PRESTO, Superconductor, Anagram, The Pass.<br />Hold Your Fire: Second Nature, Prime Mover, Mission, Turn the Page.<br />Test For Echo: Whole Album!<br /><br />So be sincere now, where in this album you find any moment comparable to all these moments I cited above? Where? Be sincere! Are you really a Rush's fan?<br /><br />Since the first song this album simply goes drifting, and left a vaccuum, where you feel the disconfort of have listened only one weak song during all that time. What a Wasted time listening to this album, awful. I've never thought that one day I would write such a thing about a Rush's album.<br /><br />This album simply don't convince me, in any way! This album is not good, really, I only gave it three stars because of usual Rush's virtuosity and musicianship, if it were only because of the songs themselves one star is more than enough.<br /><br />Weak album, not an album to be among Rush's superb discography. Boring to say the least. Even VAPOR TRAILS IS SUPERIOR, there we can find Masterpieces(Moments of brilliance) like Earthshine and Freeze.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|oh my gosh I love the part when you go to the mine it is woo cool and I love the part then you get the gems I give is 100 thumbs up I LOVE IT
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The richness of the characters and the strength of the storytelling is Martin's forte, but this book felt like stalling. Action was sluggish, and descriptions of the land and travel have become repetitive to the point of tedium. New characters are brought in, which may be necessary for a series of this length, but they lack the dimension and depth of the central characters. I hope that Martin find the pace and vitality that was so compelling in other books.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Cant go wrong with this. Paul newman at his finest. Takin it off there boss. take it off there luke.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is a must read for entertainment purposes and to give perspective on the &#34;game&#34; that is being played out in this world.  I couldn't put the book down even though I already saw the movie.  Do both, movie and book.  the order doesn't matter.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Very inspiring story of two brothers who are very different but at the same time have so much in common.

You were put here on this earth for a reason......maybe to help yourself......maybe to help someone else....but never forget You are a unique person and there is no oneelse like YOU............Take care of YOU first ......GOD LOVES YOU.............
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|cool movie. Its about a barber who kills alot of people for revenege. Watch it with surrond sound for best time.
B003V5CFV8|3.0|If it weren't for the strong cursing it would be a great movie.  Had a hard time getting past the bad words.  The first time I saw it was an edited version.  It was something to watch with the family. Not this version.  Kids are impressionable and I don't want them to think this is acceptable behavior.
B001NHNG64|2.0|takes forever to get going.  If Jack is such a bad ass he sure dosnt act like it.  Not impressed
B004K58GSO|5.0|One of John Wayne best! They can't make them like this anymore.  Strong moral good guy vs evil.  He doesn't leave his friend in a time of trouble.  Just the right amount of humor.  Rugged good guys that win in the end against the odds.  You can watch this safely with the family.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Started out not sure how I would like the series but after the first episode of season 1 I was hooked.<br />Went through Season 1 and 2 very quickly and loved each episode. Now I can catch up with everyone<br />else in RT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|game is totally awesome the horse is so cute thanks for the game so awesome cant stop playing is so addicting to play love it totally cool to play on the kindle
B00475BUVM|5.0|Yes the Clash of the Titans Kicks Butt!  You will enjoy it.  Make some hot popcorn and enjoy the movie!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. But the missions required to unlock different characters is a bit extreme. It took me a month to unlock one of the characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters are what make this series so enjoyable. One of the best acted series of our times. Both seasons are must watch.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Admittedly, I'm very new to the Dr Who franchise.  In fact, I blew through my data cap in January by starting on Season 1 with the new year.  I was seriously bummed when I saw the end of David Tennant's run.  As an actor he has a serious way of going from cordial to fury in a very believable way.  When Matt Smith took over I felt like his performance was emotionally resigned.  Through the last 5 episodes or so, he's turned me around.  Stick with the season and you won't be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun and it keeps me entertained for hours. I would definitely recommend this game. two thumbs up!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game is a little boring but fun and so does my brothers so my opinion is to make this game more fun.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hesitated picking up and reading fifty shades of grey because of all the sex. But had also heard that the second and third were the best. Now I found myself not wanting to finish book three because I did not want their story to end.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|cuz i have this game...there is a big fat monster and he has weapons chasing and trying to get you.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Had great expectations for this book but it let me down a little.  The base story line is a good one and some of the romance parts worked well but....A LOT of it should not have been.  It was insulting to me as a woman.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Kinda wish it were focused more on adults and not high school kids. But other than that it's a great read. Intense and awesome!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent read...can't wait to start party two winter of the world. I find Ken Follett an interesting writer of history.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Looks great on Blu Ray, not sure you can get much of a better picture. Makes educational television as entertaining as a movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love love love this game!! It keeps me coming back if only b/c my 3 yr old can beat my score
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read this after reading GONE GIRL.  This author has a great way of having the reader identify with a character only to find, a few chapters later, that the character is nothing like what they identified with in the first place.  The ending of SHARP OBJECTS was a bit more predictable than that of GONE GIRL, but it is the kind of story I couldn't wait to get back to after putting it down.
B00003CWRX|5.0|A great movie that is both suspenseful and relevant.  This tells the story of the process of becoming a whistleblower.  After watching this I went to internet to learn more about this real life hero.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG I love this game sooooooooooooooooooooo mucj. there has never been a problem with it and it is so much better than Temple Run because it has awesome places to go cool people and so much more so stop reading this and get the app!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

081299471X|5.0|&#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; is a great read!  I saw the movie before I read the novel by David Mitchell, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book.  It's a great piece of storytelling that is structured in a very unique way.  Each of the six storylines is told in its own distinct genre.  I think that David Mitchell is one of the finest fiction writers of our time and I am looking forward to reading his other books.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is really fun and great for younger kids my younger cuzins love it and it does not annoy me like other kid app.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Nice to go back in ww 1 and look at lives of England. You need to start from beginning to understand the whole serial
B002SJ2ZTK|4.0|The obvious things are that this is a very old movie, and one made by Hitchcock.  Being very old, it has little in common with Hitch's later, more famous films.  It is black & white and rather fuzzy, as you'd expect.  The audio is very tinny, with almost no bass, and this will be a &#34;Hitch&#34; for you if you can't adjust your equipment for it.  It still won't sound good, but tolerable.<br />I watched it again recently, because I had just seen a play based on it, which transformed it into a comedy.  It was interesting to note the many points of contact.  If you are into Hitchcock, you will probably want to see it, too.
B003MC5N28|3.0|This was an interesting story, but it was kind of a slow read. I was disappointed in the ending as well
0345525558|5.0|Everyone has explained the book so eloquently and all I have to say is I have never written a review for a book, but this book is just absolutely magnificent and I could hardly put it down once I started reading it. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Pretty violent, and I did not appreciate the strong language (cursing). Not suitable for my four year old to watch.
B002XWTKC2|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over.  A whole different kind of &#34;buddy&#34; cop movie.  If you want to laugh, this is the movie for you.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read the first book of the series &#34;Fall of the Giants&#34; and enjoyed it greatly. That's how I got this one. I could not wait to learn how the characters' lives turned out. Second World War was less of a mystery to me than the First World War, due to that I read this book with a little less curiosity. But Ken Follett delivers again. Never feel intimidated by the length of this book. It is very engaging. I think it can be advised to be read in schools for learning how war affects everyone's lives, rich and poor; and how the world is so connected.
B002QZ399G|5.0|\\"Syriana\\" is an excellent political, corporate, and espionage thriller. This is not a movie you can watch casually; if you do, you will miss the all important dialogue that is the backbone to this excellent film.<br /><br />\\"Syriana\\" has one of the best all-time classic movie lines delivered by Matt Damon in the desert while he is with one of the young sheiks while they are falconing. In those couple of sentences Matt Damon effectively summarizes the gist of the whole film, and not at all subtly so!<br /><br />I have watched \\"Syriana\\" 3 times now, and I was still having \\"aha\\" moments the third time around. This is one of the most intelligent movies of the last decade. If you are willing to do a little work to follow the plot/plots of \\"Syriana\\", you will be handsomely rewarded.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|*spoiler alert*<br /><br />This movie was hilarious!<br />I could've done without the throw up or the shower scene... but I loved the song they sang together. I've watched it quite a bit since we bought it!<br /><br />There's some great talent! Enjoy!
B00068TJM6|5.0|very happy with how this watch looks/feels. typical quality you would expect from a seiko brand watch in this price range. the only next step up IMO would be the citizen skyhawk titanium series which is 3x the price.
B00513HXE2|5.0|Having read only a few books in Star Wars' EU in the past, I recently decided it was time to do a lot more reading to see if I could more thoroughly enjoy the Prequel Trilogy and the Clone Wars cartoon.  I really hadn't been hooked in to those nearly as much as I had the original trilogy, and most of my EU experience was with the Thrawn novles and that timeline anyway.  While I started with James Luceno's Darth Plagueis -- an okay book with some great insights into Palpatine's character and the Dark Side of the Force, but otherwise a seemingly random series of scenes held together by the thinnest of plots -- it's been my second foray with Cloak of Deception that's truly changed the game in every possible way.<br /><br />Cloak follows a few plot threads that merge beautifully by the end: Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan pursuing a mercenary smuggler named Cohl, who has joined up with a terrorist cell led by the enigmatic Havac; the manipulation of the Nemoidians by Darth Sidious, leading to them gaining significant control of the Trade Federation; and lastly, the expert diplomacy of Senator Palpatine as he makes the last bold move to undermine Supreme Chancellor Valorum, and cast light on the depths of corruption throughout the Republic.<br /><br />What makes Cloak so much better than Darth Plagueis, even though it's from the same author, is that the plot is strong, all of the characters are portrayed well, and the convergence of the plot elements sets up more than just the over-arching story of Episode I's political elements, but also nearly every move the key secondary characters make -- Valorum, the Trade Federation, the other Senators of the Republic.  Whereas the Plagueis novel gave us everything we need to know from Darth Sidious' side of the story through several snippets of events, with no other characters besides the novel's name sake being at all portrayed with any depth, Cloak's characters -- new and old -- all have personality and add to the story.  For the &#34;old&#34; characters, you have the entire Jedi Council, several galactic Senators, Wilhuff (soon-to-be-Grand Moff) Tarkin, the Trade Federation's Nemoidian leaders, and of course Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon.  In every case, the dialogue of each character reads just as if it had been said by the actors from the movies, almost eerily so.  The new characters include mercenaries Cohl, Boiny, Rella, and Lope, plus a terrorist cell led by Havac.  Though some of these characters have a short part in the book -- specifically Lope -- all are important, and each feels very different from the others, easily being able to carry a spin-off novel if necessary.<br /><br />There's little else I can say, beyond the fact that this book would have been a better starting place for me than Darth Plagueis.  Cloak of Deception is a necessary lead-in to Episode I: The Phantom Menace (whose novel I've just started, and already like better than the movie!), and provides an entertaining stand-alone story in addition to the excellent insights that will lead Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to head out to that Trade Federation flagship, only to kick off what will soon become the fall of the Old Republic, and the rise of the Galactic Empire.<br /><br />As an aside, I found having the Star Wars Character Encyclopedia very helpful during my reading of the novel, or -- if a computer is handy -- using Wookieepedia, the Star Wars Wiki.  It helps me remember some of the less-well known Jedi council members, senators and so on.  None of these are critical to enjoying the story -- Luceno does an expert job of describing all of the characters -- but it was useful for reminding me who Oppo Rancisis, Sei Taria, and folks like that were.  A shining omission, I might add, was that Vergere shows up in this book with little description and only a small part, but I've since learned he's important later in the EU.  It's not worthy of losing a star, but it's notable that this character shows up with little or no fanfare and shares an important scene or two with other characters, but otherwise is pretty much just &#34;there.&#34;tant scene or two with other characters, but otherwise is pretty much just &#34;there.&#34;

B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Definitely takes me back to the mid 90's. Excellent album, love the live tracks. If you like Rage then this is an album for you.
1451696191|5.0|This book really touched my soul.  As a teenager, I lived it.  As the mother of teen aged boys, I relived it.  I have already recommended it to all of my book-buddies.  I don't know if I'll actually watch the movie--I loved the way it played out in my head.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The only thing I play!<br />Maggie the first hour ago in this blog was a great way for the firs to borrow a great deal with the firs and magazines that is here are the first time since I love the firs to deal of love the first time in this case the firs and magazines are not be a wimpy the first hour of love it when you are the firs to deal of the first time since!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B008I34ZG6|4.0|What can I say?  Loved this album as a high school kid.  Hadn't heard it in decades, but when I played it straight through, the whole thing came back to me.  It's still fantastic.  I don't see any need to engage in an academic deconstruction of Zappa.  It's a great listening experience that will elicit smiles at the humor and awe at the creativity and virtuosity.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a highly addicting strategy game with great gameplay!!! I have played this for two days straight nonstop! Not recommended IF YOU HAVE A LIFE!!!
B001F12J0C|4.0|3 great action flicks in a series for $20 in DVD format, with extras -what's not to like???????????? Buy them!!!
B003CBVU30|3.0|Good movie I actually was able to watch the whole thing. Will Ferrell is funny as is Molly Shannon although the underarm sniffing is disgusting.
140053271X|5.0|Fast, super, amazing!<br />I suggest this ebooks reader and BlueProton shop.<br />Nook is fantastic, you can root it and have more from it
B00846REIS|5.0|GREAT STORY. KEEPS YOU IN SUSPENSE. I love the way he would do anything for her even if it means leaving.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book really makes you appreciate your life and makes you see how precious time is. This book also made me feel like my struggles were in life are nothing compared to other peoples' experiences. It was a good, quick read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful highly recommend to anyone that enjoys a good story line and superb acting.. Hard to wait for the new season .
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|picked this to see if I could follow the market. Was easy to set up , easy to get info from. Keeps me in the loop.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It wasn't as good as the other two books, but you need to read it to complete the story. All in all I found it disappointing and unsatisfying.
1416550550|3.0|I had some problems keeping track of who was talking and where they were in time.  It took awhile to figure out who had the baby but for the story to be generational the baby had to belong to that person.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic, addictive book. I read it in two days despite being really busy and a slow reader! I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially teenage girls and young women (I'm twenty).
B00632HWOG|4.0|A nice complement to the email client preinstalled on the Kindle Fire. If you want to keep your Yahoo account separate, by all means use this!!
B005HED08I|3.0|The acting as bad as I remember, the props are very campy and the aliens are extremely simple suits worn by stuntmen.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Obviously a must to read off attachments and files. The Kindle Fire version works flawlessly. Now, if we could just get Adobe Flash.
B008YI99IE|2.0|The movie is even worse than you remember. Unlike the first two movies all problems are solved with a dash or gimick. Only once are you held in suspense while they try to escape a dinosaur. Otherwise it's just a journey across an island that happens to have raptors.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Quick and easy access to Twitter. I'm not a big Twitter-we, Twitter-er, but if you are, this is a good app to have.
B008YI91HS|5.0|I don't care that I'm not 8 anymore. This movie holds it's title of &#34;awesome&#34; no matter how old I get. And I'm a huge fan of the use of Animatronics and limited CGI. Love the characters, love the story, and dig that T-rex hardcore.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Just using using Google search using my browser gets more useful results for me. Others may find this helpful, though.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Low resolution downloadable version is not worth watching.  Much of the eye candy is not present because of resolution problem.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Wikipedia may not replace the traditional encyclopedia, but whenever I need information fast, this is the place to go. App is fast, and gets you the information you need.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I love this show I've seen over a hundred times and will watch a hundred more times. This is truly a great show
B008Y5OW20|3.0|Well, I'm a huge Jeff Lynne fan, as are most who would buy this record. Mainly of the classic ELO records, but I also love other productions he's done, as well as ZOOM and other things. However, these are great songs, and rightfully he has chosen them to cover. But the production is SO uninteresting, it's practically flat. None of the brilliance of Mr Blue Sky (the old ELO track) or the dynamic surges of Eldorado. It's like he's taken to stripping everything away, like a Tom Petty record - and no musical hooks or signature sounds (like the filtered voice in Telephone Line or the operatic voice in RockAria). All these songs have THE SAME drums he's always using, the same acoustic guitar strum, the same pad sounds, the same vocal sounds and sometime layers. Still, the melodies are incredible, the chord changes inspired and beautiful. But the producer-side of him really needs to wake up from the plain and simple. It's like hearing the same thing over and over again. His inspiration (The Beatles) NEVER repeated themselves, but he's obviously not learning that lesson from them. No Helter Skelter or Julia or Walrus from him now, and too bad I say, he's obviously quite capable of doing so.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises is the third installment in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. While it is not as masterfully made as the Dark Knight from 2008, the Dark Knight Rises holds its own as a solid action/adventure/superhero movie. It is a great conclusion to perhaps the greatest comic book movie series in our time.
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|Okay. We need to be honest. The story of film in 15 hours is impossible. It's too huge with way too many facets and subtleties to cover in such short a time. That being said this is still a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />I think Cousins was smart in his approach. He doesn't really tackle the technical achievements. He does mention them in passing but he more concerns himself with film language. He shows how this language evolved over time and who the important directors were that helped develop that language. There are hundreds of film clips here and he spends varying amounts of time on each one and relates the dynamic he feels is at work in each one. I have more than a few years under my belt and have been a film whore most of my life. He really opened my eyes on the way to view film. Truth be told, in some of the instances the techniques were so subtle, I doubt none but the most accomplished viewer would see what was at work. Then again, maybe they work on a subliminal level and the viewer is affected but might not know how or why.<br /><br />He covers cinematic history in many countries. Interestingly, if you read Australian film historians, they were in the fray from the beginning. Cousins gives them all of about 15 or 20 minutes here. I'm sure there are other curious omissions but they aren't coming to mind. And others have mentioned their lament that Cousins chose to narrate this himself. It bothered me early on but faded as the time passed. I guess I simply got used to it.<br /><br />Again. This is a remarkable achievement and should be seen by any fan of the art. It made me want to go back and look more closely to nearly every film I've ever seen.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program is absolutely brilliant.  We watched the first 2 seasons and we are completely hooked. Will watch 3rd season again as soon as it becomes available.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|The streaming video quality is excellent.  The movie is excellent.  The romantic angle strains credulity a little, but Faye Dunaway was amazing to look at and has a couple of great ice-breaking punchlines.  And I was reminded again of why the 70s was such a great time for movies and political thrillers in particular.  They leave you with a sense of moral ambiguity and ambivalence that films today (like ARGO or ZERO DARK THIRTY) just fail to emulate. And Sydney Pollack was a seriously underrated director from the late 60s thru the 70s (see THE SCALPHUNTERS, CASTLE KEEP and THE YAKUZA).
0316228532|2.0|The story is good but it takes too many pages to start.  I was expecting so much more from this new book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As a new Downton addict, I was panicked when I could not stream Season Two on Netflix - what a nice surprise it was to find ALL of Season Two free on Amazon Prime! After weeks of marathon streaming, I am caught up and no longer worrying about spoiler alerts about Season 3. This alone was worth the Prime membership fee!
B000VIK8D0|5.0|I love this movie, great acting, lots of stars and an epic telling of one of the great stories in our history.
B0019N94X6|5.0|This movie is great and has everything,  It was great at the movies and even in VHS....Blue ray brings it really to life with vivid colors and awesome sound.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such a wonderful book. I laughed and cried. It made you think of \\"what if?\\"<br />I recommend this book to those in true love .
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This move is the best of the three, great sound and color reproduction.  Long live Batman, he will if you purchace this.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Made it to page 37 before deleting this worthless verbose book off my Kindle...  Made absolutely no sense and is boring as all hell!
B0038ZKBDA|5.0|This movie is great and has everything,  It is a long movie that feels like it just started and you never want it to end.  I dare you not to be teary eyed at the end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not usually a Stephen King book fan, but this one was outstanding!  I could not put it down.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I watched all 8 seasons and couldn't stop watching till it was over. It had its better seasons but all and all it was a great show and I would recommend it to anyone.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|If you're an alien and would like to be introduced to this planet, this is the movie for you. It's got people, places, and things, and not much else. But it does those concepts better than any other movie you've ever seen. This movie is amazing. I'd like to call it incredible, but that implies it's not to be believed. And Samsara is too extraordinary to be faked.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Dr. Who is a great show. He is my favorite Doctor! Full of syfy and adventure. I would highly recommend it.
B0036UW09U|3.0|Kristoferson & Streisand do a great job but the movie itself is not very well made. A bit tachy at points. If you were born in the eighties or later, you won't even get it.
B00821OX98|4.0|Not much to day other than this is a fairly well done sci-fi show about an alien invasion.  Pretty solid plot and CGI.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|There is lots of action but that is expected if you seem the previous Mission Impossible movies. There really isn't anything special. Tom Cruise is solid in his role.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I really do love this product.  It's simple, clean, fast, and makes drawing easy and intuitive.  I do wish the layer cap would be removed, and I also wish that it would give us more in terms of layer blending effects and brushes ( blur, smudge, burn, etc ), but it is absolutely a purchase I am happy to have made--and I got it for less than half off, too!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this application to anyone who loves to draw, it's one of the best drawing and sketching apps out there.  I've tried the others, and they just don't compare.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Interesting theme,multilayered characters, good flow to the writing kept me reading until late at night. Good addition to our library
B005PK553C|5.0|This series really took me by surprised and kept me guessing through each episode. Jessica Lange did an awesome performance!
B00B10ENBA|5.0|This movie was great. Well acted and kept us on the edge of our seats. The streaming from Amazon.com worked flawlessly and the bonus features were great.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Doesn't work, so I deleted it. Don't know what else to say about it. It was free so I am glad I didn't waste money on it.
B008M7JODC|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this show. It was very engaging but a little over the top and outlandish. A little predictable and cheesy at point, but enjoyable and entertaining.
B009LHFYNG|5.0|The book is kind of heavy, but it has great graphics and explanations. The e-text is also quite good although I am not as sure about the Kindle version
B000HEWEDK|3.0|This one came up in a discussion on sci-fi special effects. The restored color is vibrant and fresh. It is very corny but really fun and it did have some effects that were definately ahead of their time...and come on, this is the introduction of Robby The Robot! I would love to see this re-released in 3D and since I heard it was originally released that way, I hope the powers that be do so soon. I recently got the Universal Horror Classics with Creature From The Black Lagoon in 3D and it is the absolute best version I have ever seen of it and I'll bet this one would be ultra cool in that format.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Downton Abbey chronicles the change in society after the turn of the century in England.  We watched these seasons on Amazon Prime and bought a set for each of our friends for Christmas!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Always love Nicholas Sparks books! This one is not disappointing either. Looking forward to seeing the movie now! Great book!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who is a dreamer.I wish there was a place like this in real life. The images portrayed feel so real it's sad to think you couldn't actually visit the tents and parties described. Definitely a great read!
B009G41CG2|1.0|i have played mahjong before and I couldn't understand how to play this one, so i felt it wasn't  worth being on my kindle.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Such a wonderful movie.  Of course anything that these two actors are in is worth watching.  This is something I would watch over again.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|My mom has been trying to find this for years - a good price too!She still wants La Traviata with Placido
B009JZWWGC|3.0|This movie, written by William Shatner, is best considered a comedy.  For Star Trek purests, consider it a weird dream of Captain. Kirk, because it has no place in the Star Trek universe. In that context, it is fun to watch - for those who appreciate Mr. Shatner's sense of humor.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|The albums work shows what kind of talent this band has, all the way from the drums to the vocals the album is a rollercoaster of emotion going from kick you in the teeth to depths of the heart and back again.  A great album for the collection.
0374533571|5.0|This book has so many great elements. I enjoyed the intrigue and mystery behind the main character, Pat as well as his running partner, Tiffany. The family dynamic was entertaining and Pat's attempts to find a silver lining in a life he can't understand we're truly enjoyable. Great book!
B009NCM248|5.0|It has been awhile since any band I've heard put out an album where you can't hate one track on the album and Stone Sour has done it with House of Gold & Bones.  I have been hooked on it since I've purchased it and this will quickly become a timeless classic that you have to listen to among other great albums of not only our generation, but previous ones as well.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Enjoyed all of the Mission Impossible movies.  Ghost Protocol was my favorite with excellent stunts, plot, action and locations.  Fun.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|We heard Beth Hart at the Kennedy Center Awards show and she had a 'moment'.  The ce is wonderful and soulfoul.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Good film but could have subtitles in other languages. Great image quality and the transmission didn't stop anytime. I recommend.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|Wow, I needed a 400 to 800 firewire adapter and this is what I got. It works great with no issues.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great season. Entertaining. Loved it! Watched it on amazon prime & the quality was great. Very sad the show is over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game everrrrrrr!!! This is the best game and even my sister likes it this might my top 2 favorite game.
1449410243|4.0|The book itself is of very good quality: shiny cover, nice size, etc. The content is funny, however it is a bit of the same offcourse, so to me it's the perfect toilet-book. You read one or two comics and then you put it away and read the rest later. There are some very good comics in the book, which will make you laugh your *** off. Unfortunately, all comics are also readible on-line, so I knew them all before I bought it. Delivery was quick and well-packed.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|its really  hard to find the words,but you learn lot of new meanings of words to.Also  all these kinds of books SUCKS to.
B001O1O71C|5.0|My daughter loved this book and she might read this book again. It is a wonderful and mysterious book in 1943
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I can say the story had an unexpected ending but that's what like about books. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fast moving, you don't have to wait very long for your city to make money so you can accomplish your goals quickly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and hard.this game is fine and has cool features.I like this game it nice and fun.
B009CPE424|3.0|It was ok  not as good as the other two movies were.  It just wasnt as entertaining as i thought it would be.
B00102FELM|3.0|This is an awesome concert and compiles the whole Scorpions history... BUT, it inexplicably leaves out 3 great songs played that night.  He's A Woman, She's A Man - In Search Of The Peace Of Mind and Dynamite.  Why?  The odd thing is the whole show was broadcast, and so you can get soundboard recordings of the whole show including those songs online.  So why were they left out the DVD?
B0060CX8F6|5.0|When there is nothing else on I can always count on this movie to cheer me up  We live in Louisiana  I love the scenes from N O and the music  over all My fav. movie
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|The story line combination of Borg attack on earth with first contact with the Vulcans is quite compelling story telling.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This is by far the best show on TV or ANYWHERE... Fabulous. I didn't think I was gonna like this but a friend talked me into watching it. she said &#34;just watch the first show... you'll be hooked&#34;  and I was ... very Hooked&#34;.
B00A6I87UQ|5.0|On my iPad, the Small format, easily expanded, is convenient and easy to use in the field. With the back lit screen and night mode it's a joy to use.
B007TK77QE|1.0|Asan adults book I was very disapointed.  Poor character evelopement, trite theme and lacking structure. Badly needs help from n editor.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|This movie is a keeper and that is why I purchased it.  It is a happy uplifting adventure.  A Must!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really liked this book!  Some of it was a bit easy to figure out, but was so well written, and kept my interest til the end.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Fun movie...it has everything, intrigue, action, romance, humor and many other pluses.  Add Jolie and Depp to the mix and it is good entertainment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even though I can view this on Sunday evenings on public TV, my husband must work most Sundays and can't.  We are anxiously awaiting till we can stream for free when the season is over...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got Temple Run 2 for my 9 year old son....he loves it.  Plays it every day, I'd say a well worth down load.
B0053O89JM|5.0|So glad we could completer our collection on DVD of all the seasons and watch at our leisure.  We do not have cable or satelite TV and are very choosey now with our viewing.  Thank you Amazon for making TV affordable again without commercials.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I couldn't find this movie in the stores, so went on line and it was reasonably priced. Good movie to watch over. Love the singing.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Fairly simple objective: Take your mote (a sort of gelatinous, cell-like lifeform), move it around the area, and hopefully make it the biggest mote by absorbing smaller ones....without getting absorbed yourself. Seems simple? Well it is, and isn't. The little innovations and nuances from level to level make the game challenging enough to keep you strategizing your next move for a long time.<br /><br />And then there's the look of &quot;Osmos&quot; itself. First off, this game has BEAUTIFUL graphics. Each and every mote on (and off) the screen is intricately detailed, and the colors are breathtaking. This is one reason gameplay can last for extended periods of time: it's VERY easy to take a break and be hypnotized by the vibrant yet almost impossibly simple world in which you play.<br /><br />Speaking of being hypnotized....Second off, the music for &quot;Osmos&quot; is absolutely perfect for this type of game. It's haunting, relaxing, mesmerizing, and enhances the game's potential to take you out of your world.<br /><br />Note: When you start it up, it flashes you a message that the game is played &quot;Best with Headphones&quot;. Couldn't be more true. Do it.<br /><br />Against the slew of other titles in the Appstore, &quot;Osmos&quot; stands out as one of the very best. It is much more than just a strategy game....I'm not sure I've ever seen anything quite like it. And it's well worth the $2.99 price tag. &quot;Osmos&quot; is just brilliant. Plain and simple.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing. Everyone should have this game!!!!!! I just got it and I can stop playing this game...its way better than temple run.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was not just a romance novel. This books dealt with a seriously disabled quadriplegic man, and his caregiver. She was not intending to be a caregiver, and began the book not having a clue, nor the personality for it. Ms. Moyes wrote in a very realistic style, making me really like her main characters, and delaing with real life situations. She lured me in, and by the end of the book I couldn't go to sleep until I found out how it ended, and bawled for 20 minutes after reading it. This is so normally not the type of book I like to read, but this one was so well written and realistic, as opposed to the usual boy meets girl, they fall in love, there's a conflict, they work it out, fluff of most novels. This book not only has a great story line, but it also makes you think about certain current issues, draws you in emotionally, and is one I won't forget for a long time.
B00AHGH6XQ|5.0|I love all of the Dark Knight movies, so I was excited to receive this as a gift. The 2-Disc set is definitely worth having, as the second disc's extra features are entertaining to watch. I'll be enjoying this for years to come!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Surprizingly this 38 year old mother of 2 is strangely addicted to this show... It was recomended by another mom. Can't wait for the next season...
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Awesome this is a rad game for skiers and anyone who likes anadrenlin rush of a game.  all I have to say is that its a great game
B009IEXKXI|5.0|WOW.  That was incredible.  If you want to remember the days when the space program was about SCIENCE and drama, don't miss the ride this book will give you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is a lot more fun that you would think. It gets easier as you go on, but is a bit confusing when you first start out on it.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I am a great fan of the writers, this is the poorest book they have written. Nothing like the preceeding books in the series, Actually quite boring
B00499NHLC|5.0|Not only a very successful contemporization of a classic, but a brilliant re-interpretation of the most well known stories.<br />Acting is as good as it gets.  Can't wait for the next season... please?
1594744769|4.0|It's worth extra for the paper copy because of the pictures. The story is unique and it will be interesting If it becomes a series. The protagonist is not entirely likable, but that's ok, it works for this story.
B0081336FO|5.0|Not only a very successful contemporization of a classic, but a brilliant re-interpretation of the most well known stories.<br />Acting is as good as it gets.  Can't wait for the next season... please?
B0088TG252|3.0|Don't you find it frustrating that you can't just rate with stars?  Why should I be forced to add comments.<br /><br />Amazon - home of the 85% awesome consumer experience!
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Very well done, but a little scary for some of the younger crowd; otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
034580404X|1.0|disgusting and degrading to women, wish i had never ordered or read them but wanted to see what my former students were reading.  threw away
B0095P29EG|4.0|GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS, NICE STORY - I WOULD WATCH AGAIN - THE THOR HAS A GREAT BODY AND GOOD ACTOR
B0081336FO|4.0|I enjoyed this season. I was a little iffy on the finale, but it is still better than a lot of American series. The seasons are more like mini-movies than a regular drama series, but quality is better than quantity in my opinion. The acting is top-notch and the writing is well done. Overall it is a creative show, but the characters are what set it apart from a lot of episodic television out there today.
0060987464|5.0|I don't know how I came about reading this book. Either my radar was extremely active or it was completely knocked out, but... I am so glad that I did read this book. People have to understand that before anything else, this man is human...well at least I would like to think so. 2nd, he is an entertainer, he entertains...HE DOES THIS VERY WELL. Watched his videos and I know his Last Tour on Earth CD BY HEART !! Showed my mother his Nobodies video, she sat with her mouth opened and watched it 4 times. Then I handed her his book. She read it in 2 days, my mother is 78 years old. Back to the book. There are dark clouds to every silver lining, and then there are VERY dark clouds, So dark that they are disturbing. This book is enjoyable, very dark & disturbing. To say that Brian was fighting demons, no, he wasn't. Not unless you called what he endured, what he been thru and what he put himself thru a demon. I'm sure this book was watered down, rinsed and watered down again. I enjoyed it and wish there were more books written like this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading only a few pages I was hooked. Before I even finished the first book I ordered the other 2. It is written in such a way that captivates the reader. The sex scenes, though explicit, are well detailed and make the reader wish she was there. I have never read anything like these books and I loved them all. The only problem I had was after I finished them I didn't know what to do. I wanted there to be more to read, so I reread them. The characters are all their own, they are well explained and no detail of their lives is left out. I highly recommend reading these books. All of them. They are amazing!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just want to thank you. I hv special needs child that this game has helped to improve his attention spam he had a stroke at birth. He plays the game all the time and Dr.'s as well as my self has seen a difference in his tension spam. Thank u.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita's experience resonated with me on a very personal level - her description of<br />FEAR being the root of all our problems and sickness is very well presented! and her reminders of our magnificence is so beautiful!!!!
B0001VTPWM|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift and he was sooo happy about it. The first few days he continued to watch all the movies with a smile on his face.<br /><br />I'm happy with the buy and am thankful he enjoyed it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much it's like you're dealing with real horses!!!:)<br />Also this game is good to teach kids how to ride and handle horses as if it was real life.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is lots of fun, a nice sequel to temple run 2 but i've noticed it has some glitches. I got this game on my Kindle fire, but first on my ipod and it did the same thing. Then my ipod updated the app and it works fine. I'm still having some trouble with it on my fire. Hopefully Amazon will give the app an update soon to get rid of all the glitches. Otherwise a fun game.

B000ID3KU6|5.0|Quite simply, I had not seen many Westerns. I had seen many of Clint Eastwood's works, Unforgiven, the 3:10 to Yuma remake...even The Quick and the Dead. I had heard of this movie many times, but had little chance to watch it. And then its free streaming on Amazon Prime, so I thought I'd try it.<br /><br />First off, the main cast is well invested. You have Charles Bronson (of the Death Wish series and The Dirty Dozen), Jason Robards (who I remember best for the St Valentine's Day Massacre), Henry Fonda (I haven't seen much of his works), and Claudia Cardinale (who is a stunning beauty in her own right, but I had no idea of who she was). The movie takes its time with the progression of the story, giving you little hints and tidbits into why each character is there and what their part to play in it is. Easily, a Western story that can take characters and make you wonder why they are there only to give you hints into their true selves as the movie rolls along is a good portrayal of the story...long as you follow through on it.<br /><br />Simply, you learn that a conflict arises and you have both the protagonists and the villain. Yet, the story isn't as obvious in its presentation. Each character has flaws...they come into it and help you realize that the villain isn't as diabolical as you expect...nor are the heroes as noble as you think.<br /><br />Overall, the movie stands out in its own way over 30 years later, representing a true gem of Western cinema that arises from so many others. It isn't a John Wayne or Clint Eastwood movie, but for the uniqueness that Once Upon a Time in the West has it is a real good watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would deffenantly get the game it is way better then number 1 way more exciting zip lines blades more,more,more...so so to say have fun!!
B008K8X0IS|4.0|What I love about it is it's one of my favorite shows based on one of my favorite book series of all time. It's a nice little collector's box that consolidates the whole first season of Game of Thrones. It's in Blu-Ray, DVD, comes with a Digital Copy you can download, and comes with the first episode of Season 2 on Blu-Ray...even a nice little Dragon's Egg collectible.<br /><br />What I don't like about it was that regarding the DVD element, they took 2 DVDs, placed the whole first Season on each side of the two discs, and stuck them in a cheap cardboard insert within the First Season box. Shop.HBO.Com said that the Digital Copy was redeemable on iTunes, Amazon, or Vudu, with a UV copy being available via Flixster. But when I went to see my options, Game of Thrones had only iTunes or Vudu.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good price to have a dual format. Season 1 will release again this year with Season 2 in HBO Select format that will do all of the above, but Amazon is still uncertain.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Being a horse lover, I was looking for some kind if horse game. When I downloaded this app, u thought it'd be like any other dumb horse game, but it turned out to be really awesome. I absolutely love this game...And it's FREE!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved the second installment of this series.  I can't wait for the final chapter.  My parents lived through the blitz in London, so this novel was especially dear to my heart.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I did not know anything about this app.  I began to play it and decided to restart it after I figured out the idea behind it all.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  But it remembers your device because it is internet based, so it remembers where you were at in the game.  So looks like it could be a good game.  But I gave it a 1 star because I can't restart it to play it.<br /><br />_____<br /><br />So after writing this review I got hooked on Bakery Story.  Which by the way is addicting.  One of the goals was to download and play Restaurant Story - so I gave it a try in order to get the gems.  When I downloaded I gained money somehow - I'm assuming because I had gotten to different levels in Bakery Story and got rewards.  So I was able to buy what I needed to get the restaurant going again.  SO...it is true you can't \\"restart\\" the game.  But there are ways to get the restaurant going again.  You can look at your goals and see which other games and levels will get you rewards.  Also you can add neighbors and gift each other.  This way you can get some free food to serve.  But you do have to have a counter to put them on.<br /><br />So I am now hooked on both Restaurant Story, Bakery Story and Fashion Story.  Complete waste of time but so addicting.
B007THA4FI|1.0|A real disappointment.  I found this book extremely tedious with no real plot.  Loved her Harry Potter series, but this was a mess.  I would not recommend this book.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|It gets better after the first three chapters.  There are also bit that you might want to skip like the tedious listing of all the riches Dorian has amassed.  Overall it's a great story.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I just love Ken Follett - his attention to detail and accuracy of historical events make reading his novels both fun and educational.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I had forgotten about this movie until I caught the end of it on cable one day.  I was happy to find it here at a reasonable price.  Received it promptly and have enjoyed it seeing it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It has some minor problems with the kindle service but very good. If you like horses as much as I do you will absolutely adore this app.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I remember when I was young, this used to be on TV on the 4th of July.  Seeing it again was a nostalgic event.  I've seen the remake and it just doesn't measure up to the original.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best if I could I would rate it a 5million been playing since 0.2.0 and it has never got old and the best on kindle fire now its 0.6.1 and has lots of good features and there updating all the time. BEST GAME EVER
B00ABO573A|2.0|Nothing terribly special or moving in here at all.  Felt like all the scenes were variations on the same exact dialogue.  Nothing &#34;happens&#34; in this story at all so there are no distractions from the monotony.  You won't ever describe this movie by saying &#34;remember the part where....&#34; because no part is distinguishable from any other part.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this is a functional alarm app I use on my kindle fire. You can set the alarm to gradually get louder, which is sometimes nice. I would like more alarm tones. one issue I have is that the tones are constant, no space between the sound. Still, it gives you lots of customizable options
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is one of my favorite app in the entire world! I hope you love this app a lot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game to play while relaxing. fun to play on weekends. I would recommend this game to any of my friends.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love the three main characters: Olivia Dunham, Peter and Walter Bishop.  I love the premise behind the series as well, that there is some group out there attempting to do radical things in the scientific world that endanger the well-being of humanity and that the Fringe division is trying to stop it.  It's like the X-Files on steroids and takes itself much less seriously.  Walter is hysterically funny at times and then poignantly touching.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This  book was exactly what I was looking for - it was very helpful and very simple to understand... and free :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I have been playing this game for a while now and didn't have many issues except for the fact that u can't save your game if it crashes or you move to another device. Other games do it, why can't this one? Also I am having a lot of problems going to my friends list. It says they aren't on the same game version as me and it can't connect OR it says cannot visit friends reserve at this time, try later. But I try all day. It's frustrating to try and get hearts to get this for your zoo. This needs to be fixed and an update needs to happen to allow people to save their game so all the people on here that have had issues, doesn't keep happening.
B0076DELIG|5.0|i LOVE READING THROUGH THE STEPS IN AN INVESTAGATION. VERY REALISTIC. INTERESTING ENDING AND VERY VIVID, REALISTIC AND EVERYTHING MAKES SENSE.
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved it!!  Watched it on my ipad every chance I got.  Every episode revealed more of the mystery of the house!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved temple run 2 but it froze my kindle fire. I tried deleting it and now it wont let me download it back.<br />:( :(
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was pleasantly surpried to see Season 2 streaming free as part of my Prime membership. Love this series and can't wait to continue with Season 3.<br />Picture quality was great and I had no issues at all with the streaming.<br />I totally recommend Amazon for streaming television and movies.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I first checked this out of the library because I had never seen it and was curious about it. I had the movie for four days and watched it five times. It is mesmerizing. When I saw I could get it for $6.99, it was a no brainer. Terrific, terrific movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|As a horror genre fan, my expectations are pretty low going into any new movie or TV series. I was also pretty skeptical to believe a TV series with &#34;horror&#34; actually in the title would actually deliver. American Horror Story uniquely finds a way to keep suspense up for the entire series... something that most overly produced thriller or horror movies barely attempt. I'm in love with the series and have decided it would be best not to watch anymore episode within hours of falling asleep.
0765325950|5.0|This book was a great ending to an epic tale. I firmly believe that Brandon Sanderson was the perfect person to finish this story. He did so almost flawlessly. I couldn't tell what was written by Sanderson and by  Jordan, excluding Matt's parts. It was one of the top 3 books in the series.
B004BOJM64|5.0|i liked that the cd was in great condition for the price. it had no scratches or damage to it. got here reasonably quick
B000I3W1XS|4.0|This is a bit slow and choppy, but it's entertaining. I'm not a Star Trek fanatic, but I grew up watching the TV series and, later on, the movie spin-offs. This is an enjoyable watch. Takes itself a bit too seriously at times, but not so much that it's unbearable or ludicrous. It kind of goes with the Star Trek territory, where moral lessons are part of the deal. If you like the early Star Trek movies, you'll probably enjoy this one, too.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the game.  when Temple Run 1 came out I really  liked that one, but Temple Run 2 is out of this world.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|I saw this when I was a lot younger and it seemed far-fetched to me then. Now, it seems like something the Teaparty people would love to do if they could get away with it. Unfortunately for them - and fortunately for us - the top brass in the military isn't that insane. Kirk Douglas does a fine job in the lead role, and all the supporting characters are first-rate too. Tightly scripted, the direction is spot on (events move along at a nice, crisp pace), with a happy ending. Burt Lancaster does a bang-up job as the power-hungry rightwing zealot. Oh, how I wish I could look at that fictional character and just laugh. But I can't. It hits too close to home, right now.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is the most awesome game in the world!  I play it more than half the time I use my Kindle.  I totally love this game!
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|I saw this several decades ago and mildly liked it. I saw it a week ago and liked it a bit more. It's entertaining, and the strange part is that it doesn't seem paranoid at all. If the movie were shot today, it would probably include more high-tech gadgets, including miniaturized spy-drones. Robert Redford does a good job in the role. He doesn't over-act, and he sure is easy on the eyes. Faye Dunaway does a surprisingly low-key, good job in her role, too. An enjoyable winter afternoon's watch. If you're over 50, the styles will bring back lots of old memories, and may put a smile on your face. Ah, those '70s styles in dress and home furnishing...ugly as sin, but they are evocative of a very different era. I always hated shag carpeting, but I had a good time while walking on it!
B004OZZ624|5.0|Man what love for a woman will make you do! You will be on the edge of your seat to the end.<br /><br />Great movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its fun and easy if you love horses it is great. it uses real time so its harder to make money but its still fun. it has mini games too.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Just got done with school project... file cannot open because it is corrupt. I'm about to lose my mind! Really? I spent 15 dollars on something that destroys a week of work... these developers suck.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|I found that there were too many characters popping up in unexpected locales to keep the story line straight.  The ending was not amazing nor breath-taking.  I did like the hero and suspect he might show up again in another mystery.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome is the word that can express this game.subway surfers should have a part 2 like temple run so there could be more gadgets and other things to make the game more fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kept me entertained for hours. Great graphics. Very colorful and fun. Easy to figure out how to play but difficult enough to not bore me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I completely adored this book. The remarkably imperfect characters are difficult to forget (not that you'd ever want to). I feel that The Fault In Our Stars is a strongly realistic and honest portrait of the struggle between living and dying.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Much better than MIB 2. This movie has similar energy and humor as the first men in black. Saved the reputation of the franchise.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This story is compelling. It's a real page turner.  I haven't finished it yet and cannot figure out how it will end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this down.  Watched the movie after finishing the first book in the Trilogy, then order Catching Fire.  The books are better than the movie.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Cute story.  Predictable but very entertaining.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones in the same movie, you can't go wrong.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|This is by far the most fun of them all. Great to see them all again, but this is my favorite.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This allowed me to work with a horse. I means a lot because I broke my ankle and can't work with my horses magic and thunder
B002EMESSM|5.0|Classic Star Trek! Seen it before, love to watch it again. Star Trek: The Big Screen Episode! This was definately designed for the big screen
B001FSDOZO|4.0|I love Nickelback!!! Great price...easy to find on site. Really liked that there was the option to purchase 2 for cheaper price than in-store
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 8 year old son loves this game and my 2 year old loves doing some of the simpler tasks
1878424319|5.0|I got this book as a gift because I loved it a long time ago.  I am looking forward to his new book in March
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In my opinion, there needs to be another book in the series. Explaining how Peeta and Katniss are getting through their troubles with the flashbacks and the nightmares. I want to know the kids names and what why are like. How Katniss and Peeta tell them about the Hunger Games and how they were separated then rejoined later on. I want to know if Gale ever visits them in District 12 or if they ever visit him in District 2.<br /><br />Overall this book was amazing. There were some parts where I wanted to throw my kindle across the room(when Finnick and Prim die), some parts I cried in(when Peeta was hijacked), and some parts that were just so down to earth(during Katniss's and Finnick's interviews about their lives and the Capitol)<br /><br />This book is amazing!! I would recommend it to anybody who loves a good action/romance.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Good series, but think a lot of unfinished storyline<br />Will probably read more of Dashner in the future.  Buff said
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this to be uplifting and inspiring.  It gives a different light on the NDE. I enjoyed reading it and will recommend it to others.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The show keeps getting more interesting.  The acting, writing and sets are all first rate.  We limit our viewing to no more than one episode at a time to make it last!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In the beginning I started to read this book to discover what all the hype was over this book, it soon grabbed me and I could not put it down. I am now very eager to read the second book.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I had ordered the full season on blu-ray, but did not realize that the final show was not included.  HAVE to have a complete set!  Just wish their seasons were longer!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I should have been more informed.  Yikes.... Organic will be my new mantra.  I always thought that what was happening must be a better way.  I was wrong.  My dollars will follow my new understanding.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This movie is a must see for all Dave Grohl fans, for all rock n roll fans, sound city rocks.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Oddly enough, I watched the Avengers before I knew anything about Captain America, so of course I was confused about the Captain America character. I wikipediaed the character, and kind of got a grasp on what he was like etc. I watched Captain America at my son's house a few months ago and really enjoyed it! I'm a big vintage fan, so I really loved the WW2 era, styles, culture and even the euphemisms they used.<br /><br />I love action/adventure and this was a fun, super-hero actionate, fast paced movie to watch. We all (son and daughter in law included) enjoyed the movie and the evening!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The third season was a superlative continuation of the series. The stories were well written and acted and draw the viewer into the realities depicted. I viewed these episodes over the course of a week, much like reading a book a few chapters a day. I had a better sense of continuity this way.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a predictable book and the ending was lacking in describing what happened within the city and its leaders  very average
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show reminds me a bit of X-Files.  Great mix of personalities with the characters.  Gotta love Walter!  Love it!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Not my favorite work from J.K. Rowling. It's a dirty grimy read focusing on the depravity and self absorption of the average joe. I couldn't read past the first three chapters.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The ideia is good, however<br />I will not read The others, because i'm sure The author perpetuates The same mistakes<br /><br />Its repetitive, speacially The chance of emails<br />It sucks
B001BFFTO0|4.0|If you're looking to marry the idea of form and function, you've come to the right place. These boots are majestic.<br /><br />I grew up in a wild west of snow and outdoor activities and I loved my L.L. Beans. Having moved to Seattle where it's not as harsh, I wanted something to protect my feet from the cold and dampness of the constant rain. These boots are light enough to wear on a daily basis and took less than a week to mold to my foot. Of course they keep the forces of dampness at bay but the best part is that you feel like you're James Dean when you're wearing them. I've had no less than 5 friends ask me where I got these boots and how much they set me back.<br /><br />As a note, others have talked about fit and if you're unsure about it, you can always go into a Nordstrom's and try them out before you order them. You'll save a considerable amount of money by going through Amazon, but if you're like me and hate sending things back, take advantage of the excellent service at Nordstrom's.<br /><br />I gave this boot 4/5 stars because I noticed that the heel that came standard doesn't have the grip and hold that I expect from any sort of boot. I have a wooden deck that goes up to my door and when walking on it during the rain, I've noticed that the coefficient of friction that keeps me from falling on my butt is remarkably low. I expect that when I start seeing a need to replace the heel (as other reviewers have noted) this will all clear up, but I'm a little sad that I need to re-heel a boot to get better traction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed Hunger Games. It was not your \\"run of the mill\\" adventure book. It was exciting & fast paced from beginning to end. I highly recommend it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Sparks never disappoints. I know why they make these into movie's. The books are far better. Real emotions great characters.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My 8 yo and I enjoy this version of Angry Birds and get a kick out of all the Star Wars themed effects. It is appropriately challenging but not too frustrating for her.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really got connected to this book, you can feel the emotionsb. Every description of every feeling is the best way to describe your own feelings. Is entertaining and is a story that is so seen in real life. I totally loved this book
B00992CF6W|5.0|Finally, I can build things whenever and wherever. I don't have to wait to get home<br />just to build something with my friends. I can do it whenever I want.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game and fun i rule in it! <3 i love it  my 6 year old bro rules to i can play it non stop even 24/7 jk i cant play it 24/7 or nonstop only often :)
B004US4K2C|1.0|Can't load it or try it, would have been nice to be able to customize my Fire, Maybe they will come out with an app later that will let you do that.
0988178532|5.0|I was hooked from page one and the suspense never let up thoughout the novel. Makes you think a lot about a lot of things. To be more specific would be spoiling the experience. By the time you are done, you will want to start on Book 2. Hope this gets optioned for a movie as the subject matter is so very relevant for our times.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Was very excited at first, thought this would be awesome to be able to open up my computer on my fire. Until I got signed up and see I had to pay a fee. So I just deleted the app.
B006ZNRD06|2.0|I will give the player credit, it does play the video on my kindle fire HD but the sound quality is low (you can hardly hear it,no matter how loud you have it turned up) and the screen dims and stays dim once a video starts to play. Frustrating...I will be looking for another video player.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used Avast at home for like 5 years and never get a virus on my computer, so this was great to put on my Kindle fire. Its very easy to use and has a very clean look. And its free!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome there's different characters and some. Related to where. U are in the world tourr powerups are awesome there are coin magnets and mystery boxes you can pick them up while your running from the police oh there's also jumping shoes and hover board totally worth it
B00597A6NU|4.0|Excellent movie.  Great accounting of the flying during the war.  Characters were well played. There should be more of these types of movies to record the history.
B006WJ0332|5.0|I love this show! Very addicting and love how you can relate to them!! Watched since season 1 and thought it had a great ending. Grab the tissues because its an emotional ride!!
0399160450|5.0|Mr., Clancy does not disappoint. His tales are just as intriguing now as the first time I read &#34;The Hunt for Red October&#34;<br />Nonato (Rick) Crespo
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I thought the book was well intended and the subject matter encouraged empathy and sympathy for the heroine although it is hard to believe so many tragedies befall one person as around every corner there is a new catastrophe and life changing event.<br />I rated the book a three because I didn't like the manner in which the book was written.  I felt like I was reading a children's novel.  The book is descriptive and repetitive to ad nauseam until the end when it rushes to an incomplete ending.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a great  game!! This game is ALOT of fun!! I would highly recommend it to ALL my friends!!
0307352153|3.0|Being an introvert myself, I thought I would really enjoy this book. Upon reading it though, I found it to be too dry and \\"researchy.\\" I am sure I will probably come back and reference this book at some point, but it was not my cup of tea for an afternoon read.<br /><br />I did enjoy the references to introverts that contributed to our society. Too often, people over-value extroverts and overlook the introverts who have much to say if only people would listen to them.<br /><br />I give this book a \\"3 1/2.\\" I would recommend it for reference, but not for reading straight through.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: \\"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\\"
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Really fun space western with rich characters. Thank God there's at least the Serenity movie to help extend the story. Would be awesome if they had done at least a second season though.
1401937519|5.0|Book starts out slow but gets very interesting by midway.  After reading I bought two more books for my daughters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I anticipate this show like a good book you can't put down. I went back and re-watched season 1 & 2 as well as 3 several times. I am loosing a little sleep when this show is running.  And it gets my imagination going.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Was very excited to get this set on dvd blueray. Wow, how fun it was to re-watch this classic movie. Came in perfect condition.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I hesitated long time about buying and reading this book since I already have long reading list I need to finish besides I didn't find it an important subject to read a whole book about, But keeping its position on the top 100 best seller business books for long time and the positive feedback I read here pushed me to buy it. After I started reading it I was totally hooked on it, Its very easy and enjoyable book which not only tells me \\"why\\" but also gave me the \\"How\\" I need in order to apply on myself and my business. As a marketeer I found it also full of insights that helped me understand consumer behavior more and more. Waiting for your next title Charles Duhigg :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love being able to check out books for free; reading them on my Kindle is a plus because of the light weight.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this is better than all the other modern combats.<br />multiplayer has cool maps and modes.<br />this is an epic game.<br />I recommend this to anyone
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Don't usually buy movies, but was excited to get this set on blueray. Wow, how fun it was to re-watch this movie. Came in perfect condition.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|The first chapter hooked me into the story...I later read the first few pages to my 40 year old son and he is now a Jack Reacher fan as well. Enjoy the way Lee Child sets up the background for his scenes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded it on my Kindle fire and it works great! I highly recommend. It's a great way to waste time.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is off the chain.  So addicting!!  Action packed throughout the whole season and it is so nice to be able to just keep watching the whole season all in a row.
0765325950|3.0|In a series where most books feature a penultimate battle between good and evil, how would you end it but with a 900 page battle featuring every culture and key character in 14 books. It was difficult to put down due to the entire story being on epic, frantic battle to the last.<br /><br />That said, I feel as though the author(s) attempted to close too many threads. Everyone has their moment in the spotlight. Because of this, the actual series resolution feels anticlimactic. The famous &#34;last scene&#34; allegedly penned by 'Jordan some time ago feels out of place, and lacks the mechanical explanations he typically gives for significant acts of magic in his world.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it was a pleasure to step back into that world, for the last time.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Great job!!!! I am so thankful for the service I provided and I will look for you again when I want more movies.
B001I9TK1W|5.0|A must see for Bruce lee fans. This version also includes some extra footage that was very Important. A must see Sifu Lee jun Fan( thats Bruce Lees Chinese name) is Exrtraordinary!
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Did they really need to make it this violent?  If you are into blood and guts then this is your movie.  I didn't expect this much from the preview.  I would have liked to see some more facts about actual history during prohibition rather than a bunch of greedy men do horrible things to each other.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I have always enjoyed King's ability to transport em to another time and place (and reality) and this is no exception.  It is a long book and since it was my designated &#34;bed book&#34; I only read it before falling asleep and probably wasn't in the most alert mode to remember from night to night.  But it was still a great read.
0767836324|5.0|Hook is one of the greatest movies I watched as a child. I watched it over and over again and it really inspired my imagination.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I became a DTA fan just this year after hearing my friends rave about it so much.  It's great being able to have my own marathon viewing through Amazon Prime to catch up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down!! This book is full of twists and turns I didn't see coming. This is not the typical who-done-it novel.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Awesome CD, I can put it on continuous play and listen to it for hours. Good variety of slow and fast country.
B003UESJJC|5.0|It is amazing, I cannot explain it you have to experience it yourself. It is just so great order this product right now.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|The rest of the modern world has universal health care, why not us? That doesn't mean I want to pay for cigs and weed for welfare scum. Oh buy the way Obamacare is not close to universal health care, it's just as close as the rightholes would let him get.Insurance & health care are the #1 problem for job retention & creation.We need to quit making Employers pay for it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This show is great, the writing is awesome and intelligent. The actors are great (it took me a little while to warm up to Sherlock) the season finale was a nail biter and it was free because of prime. Loved it thank you amazon
B009E3EY38|5.0|The video quality is amazing , the sound is amazing, I loved this I got this for my husband for the holidays and he was so excited if your a Zeppelin fan you will not be disappointed, other than the fact that they are not touring.
B0081336FO|5.0|What a great season, loved it to bad the next season doesn't start until 2014 because the actors are busy doing other projects.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I have really enjoyed this show. It is very entertaining. The characters are very good at acting out their part. There are many twist and turns and that make it a very exciting show.  I think it is not suitable for young children due to the sexual language and nudity. Otherwise I would recommend it very much.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app has been great to show alerts.  You are also able to add several locations and your current location.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|For those who enjoy scifi this is a great show.  The cast is great.  Can't get enough of it.  I am disappointed this is the last season for Fringe.  Wish there was something to keep it going.  I guess they want to stop while it is on top
B006O3MU96|4.0|I saw my niece playing this game on her parents iPad and thought I would try it.  It is addictive and fun but a challenge to play!  Kids enjoy this game and do very well with it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game! When I first got my kindle fire hd this was like the first game I got! If you hate this game well your a hater and you don't have a life:)
B0094K1JPC|4.0|Good story line, likely a bit more realistic than we would like to think, but...<br />defiinately a chick flick, sure my husband would not like it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great story of one of America's true heroes. Thank you to all of our troops for keeping America free with your personal sacrifices. God bless you all and keep you safe.

1452101248|5.0|Ottolenghi 's recipes aren't complicated and are truly delicious.  His cooking processes are well thought out and photos make your mouth water. I'm so glad I decided to add this cookbook to his current best seller, Jeruselum.  A smart addition to a cook's library.
0691152640|3.0|Many good points. This book is more for the real specialist than the ordinary reader who loves economics and finances.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very enjoyable challenging yet playable. Help is truly helpful! Enjoyed it a lot. Can`t wait to see what they come up with next. Great time passer on an airplane.
0307592731|4.0|I did not read the book, but my wife thought that it was so good that she we should buy a copy for one of our nieces.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. This game is the only game I play on my kindle fire definitely a game to get
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I've been reading Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus book from the very first one. Needless to say I was truly sorry when he said he had written his last book. But it seems neither Rankin or the world without John Rebus in it.  This new one is a cracking good read from beginning to end. One can only hope that there are more to come.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it, plenty of action, great plot, love how it ties in with the rest of the Avengers. Recommend it.
B00005JPLW|4.0|Actually, it was a bit more than I expected.  The amount of behind the scene footage was just great; satisfying my movie making curiosity.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show and the Walking Dead are the most original and entertaining shows to come along in a L-O-N-G time.
B00821OX98|5.0|This was a new series to me and I enjoyed it very much.  It kept me coming back to see the next episode.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much and would like to read more of Follett's books in the future.  Thank you
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This one of the best shows on TV.  It gives you a good mix of drama and history.  The acting is excellent!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Awesome.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes out of the ordinary stuff.  Mind boggling and keeps you on your toes
B0094K1QR8|4.0|I really liked this movie...some people are afraid of attachment for reasons of one or another. Give love a chance...everyone has a soul-mate out there!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just like the first book, could not put it down. I really hope they make a movie.  Channing Tatum would be awesome.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|I enjoyed all the different versions of Startrek and it was nice to visit it again. Its refreshing to view it again.
0425263908|4.0|I love the 50 Shades trilogy, and I enjoyed another erotic romance of Sylvia Day's so I thought Bared to You would be worth my while--and it was.  Eva and Gideon are believable:  both wealthy, both young, both beautiful and both terribly broken by their past.  The attraction is the type women dream of, and the pain of building a relationship from that attraction is one so many can recognize.  Sylvia Day's experience as a writer sets this book apart from 50 Shades.  I truly love this couple as much as I love Christian and Anastasia, but I find that I can believe Eva so much more that Ana.  Make no mistake:  this book is hot.  But realize that you will not be rolling your eyes at any of the narration or dialogue.  You may find your self doing a lot of comparison betwen the sets of characters between the two books, but let yourself fall into this story, and enjoy.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|. .Should have been issued when kindle fire was purchased . So people can regather thrum their computer notjudt outlet.
B008476HBM|4.0|It is an interesting novel written 200 years ago but still in vogue.<br />I don't know anybody else I could recommend it.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|A long and tortured story about an unhappy family. The last few pages try to end on a happy note.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|This is a really fun movie.  It has an interesting story line, lots of action and adventure, and it looks great.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Little did I know that when I downloaded this app, how much my 5 year old grand-daughters would love playing it.
B004LROMWU|3.0|I watched the first season of \\"Falling Skies\\" and was hoping to watch a series that would grip my attention like \\"Lost\\" did.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  While the idea of the show is interesting, a post-apocalyptic world where aliens take over the earth, the execution of the story isn't necessarily riveting.  The acting is OK, scripts are OK, which combines to a so-so show.  I recommend that you catch it on free On Demand if you want to try it.<br /><br />Instead, try checking out [[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season]].  It'll grip you on the first episode and won't let you go.
B00ABO573A|2.0|This was a depressing movie from the start. I found it to be nothing more than a person with absolutely no self respect in love with a drug addict. Eric stays with Paul even though Paul has no intention of staying off drugs.  By the end of the movie I felt no empathy for Eric, he was a masochist. Paul was definitely the antagonist in the film and had no redeeming qualities or respect for Eric (i.e. the scene with the hustler). The character development for anyone other than Eric was non-existant.<br />I rented this movie and want my 3.99 back :(
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Ever since the series \\"Lost\\" concluded several years ago, I've searched for another show that could grasp my attention and interest in the same intense fashion.  Until now, no series I've watched has held a candle to that classic show.  \\"V\\", \\"Flash Forward,\\" \\"Terra Nova,\\" and most recently \\"Revolution\\" have all failed to live up to (any) hype.  Then came \\"The Walking Dead.\\"  Out of nowhere this series grips you from the first episode and doesn't let up.  It's suspenseful, harrowing, emotional, and absolutely riveting.  I can't stop watching.<br /><br />If you buy the first season, be warned that it's only several episodes long.  Do yourself a favor and purchase [[ASIN:B005LAJ22Q The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season]] too.  You will watch these episodes back-to-back!
B0037NVM2C|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, Good acting.I want more movies like this one. Amazon. Please change your new movie selection. more often.
B008Y6SLL2|5.0|Great Story and Cast, real life event Thriller. If you liked the Wall-Street movies you will love this one. Enjoy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the way the author chose to use a different point of view to tell this story.  So creative and it keeps the reader engaged throughout the entire book.
B00104W8T6|5.0|This was included on my daughter's Wish List.  The shopping was convenient, it arrived on time and in excellent condition.  My daughter loved the gift and sharing it with her friends.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|If you haven't seen it, watch it all.  If you have, watch it again.  I promise you won't be disappointed.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This was included on my daughter's Wish List.  It arrived as expected and was in excellent condition.  The catchy cover is unforgettable.  My daughter thanked me profusely for the gift.
B000XUHVY0|5.0|This album is very explosive with lots of musical talent. Great dark funky melodic music. Too bad they disbanded!!!<br />I could listen this band's album  from track one to finish.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It was a very good plot with surprises at the end.  it was too mushy for me but well written
B004J4WLB4|5.0|In fact I enjoyed this book so much I reread to get more detail as the story line had me reading too fast the first time around.  This is not something I usually do.  A Social Worker myself, I found the book realistic and gripping.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Ehhh.  could have just shortened some of the sex scences in the first book and just had one.  Lost interest quickly
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good to find a<br />little levity in an exciting spy thriller with fast paced action.<br />You never know how it will end so you have to stick with it till the end.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Of course with all of the hoopla about this book, one is drawn to read it.  It did have some good aspects in it but tooooo drwn out.  The second book to me was disappointing.  Did not even read the third.  Just my opinion.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I'd say this one is just a slight notch below Kamakiriad, they are both of the same vein and if you dig one, you shoud have the other....
B002HWRYJE|5.0|all sincere Trekers need to see this film.  The view of the enterprise in the beginning is spectacular.  The acting is superb.  Cannot wait for Into The Darkness.  Mr. Abrams did respcet the original Star Trek, which is very important.  He respectfully gave this movie humor and sincerity.  Hats off to Mr. Abrams and staff and actors.  Excellant job.
B000E9910W|5.0|No complaints here, excellent quality audio, all the songs I wanted in one place, a cornerstone of an decent rock collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVE this series.  Amazon could not have been easier to use - we changed over from netflix.  We are very pleased
B00000I8UF|4.0|This is my 4th Messengers album and one of the best, I like them all but this one is very good. Very well worth the price, sound quality is very good.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best wimpy kid book I have ever read so I would consider anybody to read this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing. I love it so much. amazing graphics and is very very very addicting. why wouldn't anybody get this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my friend showed me temple run 2 and I've never played temple run ever since cause temple run 2 ROCKS
B008MM9630|5.0|this is such a fun game, it helps to pass the time. and it really does(: although it does require a lot of gem spending, theyre not that hard to get back.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|I enjoyed watching this version, but the description is completely wrong - this is NOT the 90s version with Colin Firth, it is the 80s BBC version. So not what I was looking for, but still worth watching if you are an Austen fan or enjoy the period.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 didn't quite match the excitement and thrill of season 1, but it was still excellent. Definitely worth checking out!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. So much better than the origanal Temple run because it has a lot more twists and tricks for you to think better so you can survive then again I love this game!!!!!!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of post apocalyptic sci-fi, but this is one of the better shows I've watched lately. There is lots of action and it always leaves you wanting more.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|If you enjoy sci-fi and fantasy you will like it. Watch the first 2 seasons first. Best with Amazon prime subscription.
B00846REIS|5.0|It is better than the 50 Shades of Grey, 50 Shades of Darker and Freed.  I would recomended to any of my book readers.
B005VPRETE|5.0|great for your 5 year old lego world is great for dexterity and all unisex yes maybe this that more
0375842209|5.0|\\"A SMALL BUT NOTEWORTHY NOTE: I've seen so many young men over the years who think they're running at other young men. They are not. They're running at me\\". So says Death.<br /><br />This most unusual story told in the first person by Death looks at `the other side' so to speak. Death appears sympathetic as he carries away souls with kindness & benevolence. Not at all the frightening entity we expect it to be. He has a job to do. It is not a happy job but he tries to do it as best he can. \\"I have the endless ability to be in the right place at the right time\\".<br /><br />This is not another WWII story set in Germany told from the Jewish perspective; in fact it is quite the opposite. The protagonists are not even Jewish. They are, however, not Nazi or Nazi lovers either. It is a look at what non-Nazi Germans endured when their way of life was being shattered before their very eyes & they stood helpless - those who summonsed the courage to help where they could often paying a high price for their compassion.<br /><br />The Book Thief - Liesel - finds comfort & strength in books - she comes by her first book under very sad & difficult circumstances, at her brother's grave, but it is a supremely important moment in her life.<br /><br />This book is written in short staccato punches just as one would expect Death to speak. There is irony, a speck of dark humour here & there; but for the most part it is a story that will take you deep into your heart & make you think about love; friendship & the power of words. Liesel will stay with you long after you close the book.<br /><br />It is a book that you should only read if you love books.<br /><br />NOTE: It is a disservice to designate this as a \\"Young Adult\\" book. It is a book for all ages.
B00005O3VC|5.0|great for your 2 year old lego world is great for dexterity and all unisex yes maybe this that more
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It's a fun way to pass some time. Still kind of new to the game, but it has been holding my interest and is pretty intuitive, so it's not impossible to figure out or frustrating.  Won't you be my neighbor? Add SaryJean
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Who doesnt Love Judi Dench? This was a wonderful series-it had me totally addicted from the first episode right thru this Special episode. It really put the finishing touches on &#34;how things turned out&#34;. I'm ready for a sequel!
B0045HCJSK|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! I bought this movie for my boyfriend, who's dad just passed and it was his dad's favorite movie!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Cooper did it again. Could'nt put it down. People will love it. Surprised ending. Love prevails when you don't expect it.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|It is a typical management game and a bit more streamlined than other game studio simulators on the market.  The primary fun of the game is less the playing and more the feeling that you are building a successful studio up from making terrible, terrible games to becoming a titan in the industry.  The feeling that you were doing well carried me all the way through to the end of the game even after I realized the hollowness of some of the elements.  It did not motivate me enough for a second play-through as it felt like it lacked additional customization features like designing your studio or the game; the game your studio produced would be good or bad seemed more directed by the training of your staff than any real direction of the player.  It is priced for a good once through, and you will enjoy that time.  You can almost enjoy the game purely from trying to think of clever game titles, or what you think is clever at any rate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could'nt put it down. The ending is a shocker. Recommended it to others. Want to read more of this Author.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice app to have at your finger tip. Easy to use. I would recommend it.  Thank you for making it available.
0451228731|5.0|One of the most captivating books I've read in a while.  The sequel Freedom is just as good.  Definitely recommend this book.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show is entertaining scifi with good character development. Special effects are kept to a minimum and the show is better for it.
B008220DIC|1.0|I started to hate this movie about an hour into it, but stayed the course hoping it would get better. It did not. What a waste of my time. The movie is about psychotics and the storyline is absolutely meaningless. The acting was great by Joaquin Phoenix, just the story itself went absolutely no where. The character of Freddie Quell, was suffering from PTSD, delusion and alcoholism. He found himself aboard a boat with psychotic cult members who worshiped \\"The Master\\". The Master influenced them all by hypnoses and delusional ideology.<br /><br />The story never had a basis or climax other than Freddie Quell wondering his way with this strange cult. I gave the movie a chance because I do like Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman. But The Master obviously suffered from poor writing which made for an unsuccessful film in my opinion.
B000O3QQ9M|1.0|I have bought quite a few albums recently. This album is so thin it won't  play. It was a present for my son and he just reminded me.
B0086700CM|4.0|No time for indecision here!  You hit the ground running,  and must jump, duck, bob and weave to get ahead.  Excellent!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Great mystery story in the spirit of the original Sherlock.<br /><br />Has a modern take with cell phones, computers, and science.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I hate this thing:( it was so hard to text through the screen protector! So disappointing. Others may have a better experience with it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very well done Solitaire app. Plays smoothly,no issues whatsoever. The &quot;tap to move&quot; feature is the best. No reason to try anything else.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|As a lover of Danzel Washington movies, I thought this one was just o.k..<br />I wish it had been better!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|A rainy day entertainment device! The dialog and graphics were cool enough to keep my son and I in a rage of laughs.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game is highly entertaining. The graphics and audio are excellent for children. It is one of my six year old nephew's favorites.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Very interesting story by Oscar Wilde. Good author a lot of depth. Really enjoyed it. Would recommend to anyone who loves immoratality.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|this is a great app especially since its free. I suggest getting It. but it does take up a lot of space.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Bl**dy. Brilliant. Characters. Great show that you can even watch with your kids! What a concept? Plus, the writing is phenomenal.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Love this book ! A must read for all.  Once you start reading you can't put it down.  If you love and understand dogs read this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Kept the reader interested.  Not just a romance or &#34;thrills&#34; novel.  Made you think.  Recommended for a general audience.  Well worth reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son loves to play this game.  It helps him with his hand to eye coordination.  I have played it as well and it is hard to put down.
B003B02PFO|4.0|Very entertaining.  A story that you can put down and pick up again without forgetting about the characters.  Ending is predictable.
B0089K7DGW|1.0|I bought two box sets and both didn't work. I've tried other DVD's that I own and they work fine.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This is my second TK41 that I own. I love the size, and love the fact that it uses AA batteries, which fits my &#34;system&#34; very well, as the other (5) Fenix flashlights I own, all take AA batteries.  I was just outside with it now, checking my street to see if they plowed it after this blizzard we  got hit with, and as always, the TK41 delivers a very long throw.  At 200+ yards, I could make out a neighbors # on his house, no problem.  This is a great bedside light, would be a great way to blind someone in a self defensive situation. I also carry one in my car.  I was looking at the bigger lumens lights, but they take different batteries and I wanted to keep everything the same. 800 Lumens is amazing, on a lit street....get it in the woods or out in the desert...in the pitch black and it is amazing. Has 4 settings from very low to blinding 800 lumens.  Built very well also.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My kids and I have read all the books and seen the movie and I thought this is a good story for teenagers and older.  The subject matter is a little troubling, but not for the sake of gratuitous blood and gore.  The book is very well written and I felt it did a great job of continuing the plot from the first story.
B007IK44CK|5.0|MI movies always have something unexpected. Love that about them. They tried to insert a bit of humor here and there. Didn't work out so well. But, a fun movie to watch at the end of the day.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A fascinating and inspiring read.  If you ever doubted life after death then read this book.  Then look on the net for more books by a variety of authors on the same subject and you'll see many parallels between them all.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|If you have an addictive personality, you'll be hooked! Have fun either rain or shine..... If you like having a goal to reach, they give you plenty of them. And it's not as easy as it may seem, just give it a chance!!
1449415881|5.0|This is a yearly purchase which I love love love ... and my husband does too.  Where else can you get ideas of ways to laugh at your co-workers and boss for their stupidity and silliness ... lacking common sense... and we all know they are regularlly doing this.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Vince Flynn novel.  This was an extremely diificult book to put down.  Lots of action and the main characters stayed the same from past Vince Flynn novels.
B004EPYZP8|1.0|The supplier said this was used and in good shape.  NO IT WAS NOT IN GOOD SHAPE.  Do not buy from this vendor.  They say the product is good.  It was scratched and would stop working all the way through.  I'm going to have to rebuy the video just to see the LAST LINE of the movie if you can believe it.  This vendor provide inferior products.  Do not buy from them.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|For SciFi lovers and lovers of the weird, these are smart, funny and relevant scripts.  The underlying moral lesson of should we do a thing even though we can is important when in the real world science is outstripping our ability to make informed ethical decisions about what we do.  I'm addicted to this show!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Got this for a lower price as the single disc at Walmart.  Definately worth buying if you are going to get the movie.
B0053O89YM|5.0|One of my favorite TV shows - this is the best!  Quality DVD and quality show - would rate it excellent.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved it untill I  went to a different game and when you log back on it crashes no stars.  -
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played it has many levels and armor, weapons,  and other things like potions
B0098VXDDS|5.0|We just love this series and all other before it :) They give some history about Spartacus and Rome. However how they speak may be more along the lines of how we would understand them today. Great show!
B00005JO9J|5.0|grey's anatomy is great show!  loved this season.  came in original package and viewed without any problems or scratchers.  great video
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|So far all of the new batmans have been fantastic, This one will not dissappoint just the same. Loved it.
B003DTMUOE|4.0|The book is pretty good but the translation to spanish is not the correct at 100 percent. I recommend this book but in english.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|it is a perfect size.  it holds my stylist.  it is easy to store.  I would like it to come in different colors though.
B003H06SFQ|1.0|Region 2 encoding: Will not play on most of the devices sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region player and compatible TV.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think Temple Run 2 is more interesting than the original temple run. I like how the giant demon monkey is chasing you instead of lots of tiny wimpy monkeys. The display is so much better and clear. The HD is perfect and the rope you ride in the begining is very fun. The train ride is awesome. Good quaility games that are free.... Download Now!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Yes I am way behind starting this show but regardless it is hilarious. It is so cheesy but it knows it is and embraces it fully. I cannot wait to dig in to the next seasons.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The Hunger Games was a nice escape.  As always, it is better than the movie because of the ability to develop the characters with more detail that a book provides. While the book is pure fiction, it is true enough to human nature that I could believe that it could happen.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm not usually one who is at a loss for words but this show does it. All I can say is it is absolutely brilliant and I couldn't be more ensnared with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. I only wish I had discovered this show earlier.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Its amazing to me how childrens stories make such great movies.  Great animation, great story, I will probably watch it again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It provides a clear picture of the inter-relationship between the British privileged class and those that served them.  The setting in the large &#34;Manor House&#34; is magnificent and watching the carefully orchestrated daily ritual that accompanies the lives of those involved in this drama is fascinating.  The story that unfolds is both believable and interesting.  If you enjoy period programs this is must view.  Once again Masterpiece Theater has treated us to another great production.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is no other app that I use more often than this one. I don't even check the weather as much. Of course the content is second to none. Many translations of the Bible are available, in several languages.The daily reading plan is great.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|great for kids and adults. Had a great time opening these up for an advent &#34;thing&#34; to do. Great idea instead of the typical little candy gifts you get with most advent calendars
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After another marathon viewing to catch up, I am so looking forward to Season 3 and the arrival of Lady Cora's mother.
B004AQR24W|3.0|This movie is way cool, however Amazon should invest more in streaming quality. Even for a non-HD movie the picture quality and resolution was far from been acceptable (a DVD has much more quality then Amazon's streaming). Also, Amazon's web media player is never able to fill my widescreen TV (there are always black edges on both right and left sides of the screen).
B001FVV2X2|4.0|This is a remix of The X-Files. A lot of fun and interesting scenarios, but far-fetched of course. A nice perk for Prime subscribers.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie is way cool, however Amazon should invest more in streaming quality. Even for a non-HD movie the picture quality and resolution was far from been acceptable (a DVD has much more quality then Amazon's streaming). Also, Amazon's web media player is never able to fill my widescreen TV (there are always black edges on both right and left sides of the screen). Moreover, during the movie, the streaming stopped 3 or 4 times (one of the breaks took up to 2min to recover streaming!!!). Since I have already streamed HD movies using my home broadband connection from Netflix and other sources without a problem (good quality and no interruptions), I can conclude that this must be an Amazon issue.
B005PK57IK|3.0|I watched this via Amazon because I missed the broadcast.<br /><br />What else can I say?<br /><br />The series itself is 5 stars as far as I am concerned. I took two stars off because Amazon does not bother to provide closed captioning, and that takes much of the fun out of the experience as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />I typically watch with closed captioning on, for a number of reasons (hard of hearing, English is not my first language). Netflix and Hulu can do it and they don't even charge per show. So I won't be streaming much from Amazon until they figure out closed captioning.
0451531051|5.0|This is a small little book, not a hard cover.  It just has Edgar Poe's poems in it.  So if you like his poetry.  The book is fine.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was absolutely wonderful to read! Nicholas Sparks does it again with a very real book that it hits your heart.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check the weather every morning before I go to work.  It is nice to see what the weather is for the day or the week.  You can program in more cities for a quick check of where every you want .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An excellent cast; great authenticity; and, with so many stories going at once you cannot wait to see the next episode!
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is great to get your emails on the run.  I downloaded this on my kindle so I can get my yahoo mail anywhere.  Works great.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|My husband founc this to be a sensitivre and positive treatment of a difficult topic, one that is not often talked about.  It was thought-provoking and heart warming.
B004MQ8A78|4.0|Very scary. My favorite part was when all of the cabinets swung open at once. Toby, the demon was very scary. Great movie
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed it, didn't want to put it down, however it seemed a little slow in places and didn't have the detail of some of his other works.<br />Still a good read though.
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|It is a great movie for people that like action and adventure and blood and gore, like my husband. Me, who likes love and romance, not so much.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I've used this app in the past without any trouble on my current phone (Motorola Atrix 2) and on a PC and Samsung tablet, but now I cannot get the app to work properly on my Atrix 2.  Logging in just wouldn't happen until I restarted the phone, and after finally logging in, now it won't load my cloud music.  It just cycles with the message \\"Loading your cloud music...\\".  My connection via wifi is good and everything else works just fine.  I'm assuming this is caused by a recent update.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. love having missions or things that I need to do. my daughter love it too. tells me shes learning about the trials of moving west.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I wanted to see a little more about the 3rd season, but this preview is very general and short. I was not impressed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I found it very entertaining. the description of the characters and locations were absolutly wonderful.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|It's like a dream sequence kid discovers he has magic and it conveniently comes to him when he needs it most .  He goes out on the 3rd day of being a soldier and without having any sword training his whole life assaults a apparently retarded 9 foot tall monster in the woods by stabbing it.  He then is adopted by the king . I kept waking for the kid to wake up and have to go thru some sort of grueling rigorous training and for the book to fast forward 5 years whereby the kid has gained muscle and knowledge as opposed to just being born special.  If your looking for any sort of realism you will not find it here.
0740797719|5.0|I am a landscape artist and love the way this book shows light effects and color. I like drama and color in my paintings to be realistic.
B002PNER9U|4.0|I had to watch this for a Theater class I am taking. I thought it was well done, the cast was in sync with each other. While there is a lot of tragedy in it, I enjoyed it. I think my favorite part was Angel's Mrs. Santa dance and drum solo...
B008IBPMZG|5.0|When Downton Abbey was first recommended to me, I was hesitant to get into another show as I am still trying to get through all the seasons of Breaking Bad. I am SO glad that I caved and started watching this show. It is simply addicting! I went through 2.5 seasons in less than a week, and I am dying for some more!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I actually only started watching in the final season. I quickly realized I had to watch all of the seasons.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Great story about learning to care for others and not being selfish. Pixar has also done a stellar job on the animation. There are parts of the scenery that could pass for real.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I actually only started watching in the final season. I quickly realized I had to watch all of the seasons.
B00499QUK2|5.0|great adaptations of the original stories   very entertaining   great acting   looking forward to future seasons of the show
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The most fun time i've had reading in a long time.  I had know idea what i was getting into, I new nothing of this<br />book and know one i new had read it.  It fwas very creative, the characters where great, Katnis was wonderful.  I<br />sent it to my sister for her husband and sons to read, the all loved it and couldn't wait to read the other books.
B008133MDK|5.0|great adaptations of the original stories   very entertaining   great acting   looking forward to future seasons of the show
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is different from what i usually read, ie, know murder, aliens, ghost, etc.  It was just so normal, the family,<br />the story, I loved it and couldn't put it down.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Big fan of the show.  Wanted the whole series to replace the VHS tapes I had recorded.  This was easier to store.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was a little disapointed in the third book, I felt a little cheated, almost like the writter had run out of a story line<br />for the character.  I would recomend it, but its just not as good as the other two
B003O86FMW|5.0|A riveting story that I couldn't put down. I cannot wait to start reading the next book in the series.  Suzanne Collins is a fabulous story teller!
B003O86FMW|5.0|exciting, different, love the characters, you really understand Katnis, the writter has a good grip on her and you<br />never have to second guess her.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I literally can't stop watching it!  The story line is great and I feel in love with the characters from the first episode.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|There where some good parts but then there where some that seem like the writter was lost, not moving forward<br />with story line.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a cool game! It's worth the money even though it is only 1$!I love it!you should definitely buy it
B005HED11Y|5.0|This is great classic science fiction and if you, like many, have seen these time and time again in re-runs it is worth checking out in HD.  Check out Rock's garb and makeup in 'Wlhat are Little Girls Made Of'.  It really brings the character out.  I think the sound is improved as well.  I am looking forward to listening on some good headphones.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is quite challenging. I usually have to use the hints and need to re-shuffle quite a bit. It is good brain exercise. I like majong a lot and have several different versions.
043902353X|4.0|A good book, one of my favorite series. And I am so totally excited to see all the movies as they come out!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love putting puzzles together so this game is wonderful.  Each puzzle is different and the levels go from easy to hard.  This is a must have game!
034580404X|4.0|Good series, say what you like about it, but I read all three enraptured. I couldn't put them down. Don't judge.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game at any time.  The cards move well and the game is easy to play.  It is a must have game!
0439023548|4.0|I love the book, and I love the series. Looking forward to seeing all the movies as they come out!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u love horses like I do!  This is a must have game.  It teaches people of all ages how to take care of horses.  It is fun for all ages to do.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Some boards are frustrating but all in all this app is one of the most addictive games I have played in a long time.
B006UN3K4O|5.0|Everybody should read this book. Divorce rates every where would be halved! Definitely worth reading! Thanks John Gray lol<br /><br />Thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how my daughter can take care of her own horse!It really feals like you are taking care of a real horse Its amazing!For free too!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny, sexy, exciting, heart breaking, emotional. This book had it all! I loved the story and the characters. The feelings were incredibly described as if I were that person.
B000NDEXOI|5.0|waiting a long time to get this & happy at how fast it came...  very good quality also. ready to get more
B005CRQ2XA|3.0|I thank you for letting me read this book and I can't wait to read the rest.live Lon and hope you have fun with the movie and books
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Given the gruesome details of how the animals are treated, from birth to slaughter, this film I would not put this film in the category of &#34;entertainment&#34;.  However, it does a good job of reminding me of all of the reasons for doing my due diligence about the food I eat, including eating organic and not trusting the &#34;conventional farmer&#34; or the FDA to have anything but their bottom lines in their sights.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more time devoted to how the immigration issues in this country are so much about making sure that the agro business continues to make healthy profits, but a thinking person could take what was said and certainly draw some pretty chilling conclusions.  Those unfortunate folks have become the &#34;new&#34; wave of those who can be taken advantage of, just as Afro-Americans were before the civil rights movement.
0756688701|4.0|This would better have been titled a \\"Diecast Catalog\\" rather than a \\"Character Encyclopedia\\", since the characters included are only those for which a diecast model has been issued.  For \\"Cars\\" that seems to be a fairly complete selection, and all of the many variations issued for each seem to be included.  For \\"Cars 2\\", though, there are a number of obvious omissions.  (Where, for instance, is Siddeley, the jet?)<br /><br />I also object to the fact that for some characters, the listed \\"Vehicle\\" on which it is based is fictitious, even when the character was obviously based on a real vehicle.  For instance, it is fairly well known that Professor Z was a Zundapp Janus, that Max Schnell was a Mercedes, that Victor H. was a Yugo and that the Queen was a Rolls Royce.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I appreciate the details provided for each car, and seeing all of the variations on Mater (as seen in his dreams!) in the back of the book is worth the price of admission.  The comprehensive index, which lists the location of every variation, is welcome.  This book is for everyone who likes the \\"Cars\\" movies, and not just the kids!<br /><br />I hope that Pixar and DK eventually do an updated edition which includes EVERY identifiable character seen in either movie and the short subjects (whether issued as a diecast or not), and that they do it as a much slimmer book that omits the free diecast and poster.  (The actual printed material is only about 1/3 the total thickness of this book, and I'm not sure I have room on my bookshelf!)<br /><br />(P.S. The book \\"Meet the Cars\\" is actually much more complete, though it doesn't show all of the variations found in the diecasts.)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Highly addictive game! Grand daughter loves to play it!! Keeps her entertain while out driving around doing errands during the day.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you like old school and English, you will love it.  This is other side, the story outside of the big house in the village!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a good read with many &#34;ah ha&#34; moments. I like tidy endings.  This did not deliver.  Enjoyed it.
B004R112GO|4.0|I think this is just as good if not better than the first. It adds a bit more background info and is scary.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a very fun game. I love the temple run games. This was another wonderful game. This is a MUST-HAVE game. My favorite part is its free!
B00715RI16|4.0|I really liked the first two. This one, for me anyway, is only good for information on why the girls are haunted. The movie had it's moments but I just don't see how they couldn't remember some of this stuff that happens, especially in the end.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Some pretty difficult boards on here, the kids like it more than me, ad they were the target, I only use games to pass the time, they like to play them for fun.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|The original was a great flick, cheesy but entertaining and there was a limit to the terrible GCI they used.  As the series went on each movie got worse and worse, this one was the pinnacle of awfulness.  The whole movie was just scene after scene of bad CGI slow motion action and it wasn't even good CGI or slow motion, the original from 10 years ago almost looked better.  Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this.
B009C7JS14|4.0|Free version only gives you 2 cities but it works well, not very much detail but temp and forecast is accurate.
B002V9PEUE|5.0|Check your brain at the door, it is a Stallone action film. Once you get that out of the way, just sit back and have a good time. Great action, awesome cinematography, and a very worthy villain in John Lithgow's character.<br /><br />Season's over a--hole!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Really lovely, controls are intuitive, gameplay is transcendent.  Beautiful soundtracks abound, the games manage, without a single bit of story line to be completely captivating and totally immersive.  Also, completely kid friendly, thought the &#34;journey&#34; game has it's dark and suspenseful moments, to be sure.<br /><br />totally worth it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I won't dock the review of an entire box set because of a questionable sequel. The films look great and they are loaded with some decent special features. I grew up watching the films on VHS, then DVDs, and to see them in high-def really presents them in a format that can allow me to enjoy them all over gain.
B00846REIS|3.0|A friend thought that it would be good reading. It was ok<br />Not sure if I will read the n we next one
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As my husband never seems to tire of telling me, this is really just a soap opera-but it is done so well! Even he can't get enough.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle, a true American hero doing what he loved. He lived an interesting and productive, although not enviable life.  His last acts as we're his first, helping others who were less able to help themselves. God bless his family and may his guardian angle become theirs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app. I don't really know what to say.  I love this app Verry much. u ch fhd urbjr rhjeb rjnf urbb.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|They didn&acute;t take out anything we loved about the first one. They added some new and fun upgrades. One of the big changes that makes the game feel even better, is the hilly type paths. No more running on flat ground the whole time. :)<br /><br />And like the first you don't need to spend any real money if you don't want too. I have yet too and still enjoy the game to the fullest. Much more fun i think to work your way to upgrades.<br /><br />In the end if you really liked the first one, then no reason you shouldn't love this one.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|good set of heat resistant utensils; they sit up off of the counter top so they don't lie on the counter and get dirty, a real pet peeve.  highly recommend; easy to clean.  dishwasher safe.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy the challenge of this game.  It is not your regular solataire game.  It is a step up to win a game.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Haven't finished the book yet. The chapters flow easily and are like short stories in themselves. This hundred year old man has a lot of spunk!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As a social studies buff I found this book riveting.  I read it very quickly even though it was a long read.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|Do not waste your money on this movie.  It is pointless and not remotely funny.  I gave it away immediately.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had never heard of this series before, so was hesitant to start watching it, however, I really enjoyed it. When a show can toy with my emotions, it has my vote.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome. But I wish it was easier to get the gems.  Overall I thi k this game is over the top
0988178532|5.0|From the opening pages until the last, Outview carries the reader through each step of Nate's journey.  Brandt Legg has an incredible ability to keep the pace of the story moving forward, while allowing us to visualize the characters, places, and events to become entrenched in the tale.  The use of historical events infused into the story act as a grounding in reality and a \\"what if\\", that captivates the reader. Throw in a few surprises and a couple of \\"a-ha\\" moments, and Mr. Legg has created a book that is difficult put down.  A must read for teens, young adults, and adults who enjoys a well-rounded story.  What will the next stage entail?  Bring on Book #2!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best show on TV right now.  Great acting and many great story lines.  I hope it continues.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the best book I've ever read!!! Thank you Suzanne for the best book:) Can't wait till Catching Fire!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I absolutely love her books! Extremely addicting and captivating. I totally get lost in the books as if the rest of the world does not matter! Thanks
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|awesome<br />and so cool yea and u live for belkin<br />yyyyyyyyeeeeeeeaaaasssasssss<br />cool so cool yea this is very Liz out yall
B008Q0AZVK|3.0|This movie was ok. Can't say that I really cared about the characters. Could have been executed with a little more finesse.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Usually, the aphorism &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; means that anything free is of dubious quality or worth. This kindle version of Les Miserables belies that notion. It is an excellent porting of Hugo's masterpiece to the e-reader format.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|If you are always on the prowl for movies that aren't the same ol thing... look no further! Here is one that I want to tell everyone about and watch over and over!
B006S08RLU|3.0|I found Amelie a little too contrived.  To me, the plot was improbable, but it was fun to watch it once.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I freaking loved the movie Pitch Perfect and I loved this bundle. It's definitely worth it to get the bundle because the Bluray has more special features than the DVD and the digital copy allows me to watch it from my laptop orKindle. So glad I got this. Perfect.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best second books I have read, a new adveture in every chapter, keeping with the orignal story line.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watching Season 2 was like reading a great book. I just could not put it down until I finished viewing the last episode.
B008M7JODC|5.0|If you like sci-fi you'll like fringe. Good actors and an off the wall, epic storyline. And Olivia is totally hot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A computer app that is easy to use and does not require me to sit at a table or on the floor.  Lots of fun and variations.
B009CF7JDU|4.0|the movie still holds up. Some &#34;older' films seem dated after 15-20yrs not this one.  Maybe certain aspects of high school days don't really change.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have already read this book once, seen both movies, and ordered another copy for my Kindle.  I plan to enjoy it yet again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was great it has a heated love scene and so many other enlightening plots it all runs together very well and hooks you from the very first page
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series I have watched in a long time.  Love the characters!  The story line is wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT's better than most of my apps. ALSO HAS BETTER GRAPHICS THAN TEMPLE RUN. I CAN'T WAIT FOR A NEW VERSION!
B0095P33IW|3.0|No suprises in this latest Avengers installment. I good superhero movie, but not anything special. You have seen the freindship plot line many times and the romance plot line seems contrived and not believable.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I love star trek (classic) Spock is awesome he is a stud muffin. It's sort of funny how captain Kirk falls in love with another women every single episode. It's clean, no cuss words and you can always count on captain Kirk to be dramatic
B00846REIS|5.0|For any readers that loved the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy this book is just as gd if not better
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Having read the whole series  of Rebus this is one of his best.. .he makes me want to to to Scotland
B00407PNY2|4.0|Great car chase scenes, McQueen did some real good driving,plus this sold a lot of Ford Mustangs and Dodge Chargers.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with excellent stars and script.  I highly recommend it to adults contemplating retirement.  It is very well done.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Surprisingly suspenseful, even though the ultimate outcome is known. Great recreation of the era. Compelling.  Well-acted, well-directed. Absolutely worth seeing -- as a lesson in history, as well as great entertainment.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I thought this season of Downton Abbey was well done.  There were a few unexpected scenes, but on the whole it kept up the rave reviews that it has had from the beginning.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Worth seeing because it's a great film, using predominantly real ballet dancers, but most compellingly for Barbara Hershey's performance alone as the mother -- a manipulative, creepy, disenchanted former-dancer. This film is unnerving, compelling and darkly captivating. (The Academy Awards nomination process was undermined (once again) when they completely passed over Hershey for even a Best Supporting Actress nomination, which she also should have won!)  Natalie poured herself into this role, spending a year reviving and toning up her childhood ballet skills, to be a convincing prima ballerina. (The dubbed dancing, to up her own very-impressive game to convincing prima status, is undiscernably woven in.)  The very young dancers from the PA Ballet (who were cast as the fictitious corps de ballet) understood what too large a percentage of the preview audience did not -- that much of what happens is symbolic or imagined, and reflects the fears and altered reality of the main character, who is ascending toward her long-coveted goals while descending into madness.  (The dancers felt compelled to point out that, in their experience, the world of ballet is not nearly so relentlessly competitive and cut-throat as portrayed and that the story could be told of any relentlessly driven perfectionist in so many professions. The same can be said of parents who pour their own ambitions onto their child, to the point of perversion.)<br /><br />It is not a ballet movie so much as a study of human ambition and mental frailty.  But all things portrayed in the movie may or may not be reality -- it flows so thoroughly back and forth, it can drive a viewer insane to try to make literal sense of it all, so just go with the flow, assume you are viewing everything through the mind of a girl going mad, and be thoroughly carried along.  Mila Kunis is captivating as the fresh competition who, seemingly, has her act together.<br /><br />You can easily overlook one or two slightly awkward performances by supporting males, as they went for great dancers first in some cases.rmances by supporting males, as they went for great dancers first in some cases.
B004FP1WX0|2.0|This film was promoted as \\"A riveting suspense thriller with a jaw-dropping twist\\" but I found it to be neither riveting nor suspenseful, with a `twist' that fell flat. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, then it ended.
B003RUZKC8|4.0|Shoot-from-the-hip, cool, funny, irreverant, steamy action, flippant dialogue, bothersome theme of our government-as-bad-guy but a fun movie none the less.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I expected nothing less from these girls, and have been listening to the album on repeat. I listened to it on Spotify, and still bought the mp3 version here on Amazon :)
B005H9B2CE|2.0|Should have been a much longer movie so that the changes in the lead characters could have been more believable. The plot is as old as the hills, and the overall acting was not the best. Still, the action scenes were very well done, and the visuals are striking. Great movie for a rainy weekend.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love this app. It works great and you can access everything. And I love how its free to! Great app.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|This book had an awesome storyline and I read it in a day. But the author didn't do a good job at spell check and the mistakes made me want to kill myself.
B004U8VUUC|2.0|Both great actors, story was boring, kept waiting for it to get  going, never did.  May have been the editing, confusing most of the time.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B00136JQMI|5.0|A blues fan, but haven't specifically listened to an entire miles davis album.  After listening to this fantastic CD - a new fan!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the very beginning, it seemed like this would be very predictable of a read. But there were great moments in this book that made you question how it was going to end. Hoover took a tragic event that happens more often than it should and put it together with a character that wasn't going to let it define her. Even if she didn't even know it yet.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|After 1962 Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\", this book should be made compulsory reading for every College Graduate  (and EVERY PRESIDENT) world-wide.<br />The printed edition has over 500 pages (Hard to estimate in a Kindle edition), and maps, tables etc are completely unreadable on my Kindle, which makes understanding a rather scientific book more difficult. At times, the Author repeats himself, often verbatim<br />Still - a fascinating mind-grabbing book one can't put down, as well researched as anything I have ever read.<br />Although written in 2005 - not much has changed for the better since then.<br />It is certainly a 5* book
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not at all what I expected.  The story line was dull and uninspired.  The characters were confusing and quite boring.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|It was just okay, nothing to rave about.  I appreciated that the plot isn't something I've seen a bunch of times before, but I prefer stories that are less predictable.<br /><br />My husband on the other hand liked it.  Either way, if you're just looking for mindless entertainment, it will do.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Loved the music, Rebel Wilson is hilarious, and I actually enjoyed that there wasn't really all that much of a plot. All in all, a good time.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Anytime you set up an assassin as your protagonist, you'll have to work a little harder to engage the audience. This film does a good job with that and the time travel twist - being face to face with yourself - was a nice touch.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The story was quite a thriller and hard to put down once you start reading it. The journalist and girl had strange relationship but uncovered points to solve family mystery.  Truly enjoyed.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|because it resonates with me.  I Love Beatrix's perseverance and totally understand her desire, her loss, and her passion.  Renee Zellweger is an excellent actress, capable of projecting such subtle and powerful emotions.  Of course, Ewan McGregor is a huge impetus, he plays an amazing boyish character who is entertaining and quite naturally handsome.  Emily Watson, fantastic.  Barbara Flynn, what a funny woman, she was awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I love this series. It was recommended to us by many other couples. It's a great period piece and you don't have to worry about any nudity or bad language if you have young kids potentially in and out of the room while your watching (which it seems most other 1 hour dramas try to incorporate both language and nudity these days)
1607053551|5.0|This book covers so many aspects of the business in an easy to read format.  So grateful to you, Kim Kight.  Thank you for sharing your information and encouragement.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's something to do daily, can play everyday, more than once, keeps going even if u dont spend &quot;real&quot; money!! thank's for the entertainment! Murphintop!!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|What can't I say about this movie. Will ferrell is funny and makes the movie. And has a great cast that backs him.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it<br />thank u very much for a great experience. my daughter loves it. it is very cool. thanks again
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|This book just drug on for days.  I kept waiting for the book to build, to my disapointment it was repetitive and long.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Pages always being turned<br />Always want to read over and over again<br />Talked about with friends<br />Can't wait for the movie
B00821OX98|3.0|Season 1 spends a lot of time building on its characters and killing a lot of aliens.  Very repetitive plots.  Season 2 gets a lot better.  If you get bored with season 1,  get the essentials by watching the season 1 highlights 1 & 2 at the beginning of season 2
B008F5YDRI|2.0|Love Emily blunt but couldn't make it thru this boring movie.no chemistry between characters and plot left a lot to be desired
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|This is a great book.  I finished reading in a day.  A great read for a teen or an adult.  Everyone who went to high school will be moved by this story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent portrayal by gifted craftsmen.....lessons to be learned about money management too.....though set in bygone era we have to compare...
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great series.  I became so immersed in the story line that I have to remind myself that I don't actually work for the CIA.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I honestly love this book because it is amazing and I really get obsessed with this series:) a must read if you like fantasy books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My husband and my kids can't stop playing!I would recommend this as a game every one can enjoy. must buy.
B006ZCWTG0|5.0|Another rippin' album by Meshuggah. I can't believe how long they have been playing for and still rippin' it up!
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|This is my first time listening to Mr. Clark and I was not disappointed. Every track has a different vibe and that's what kept me wanting more! Can't wait to see him live!
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|Loved this disc in high school and love it even more now. I can't believe it took me so long to buy it again!
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|This is RATM at their best! This is everything good music should be! If you don't like this shame on you.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Overall a good read that entertained.  I don't know that I would argue real hard that the premise was fully believable or the characters deeply developed but they were both complete enough to make the book fun to read and did not distract overly from the story.  While I could argue, on the one hand, that the hero was a bit too infallible, I would then argue that this is, after all, a novel and not a biography.  I tend to read mostly non-fiction, and then after some time, just need something a little lighter and fun to take a break from actually having to attend to what I am reading.  This fit the bill for me and I have enjoyed several of Follett's other books also.  Character development and involvement were not nearly what I experienced in his Pillars of the Earth, but there was also only about a quarter of the pages and time involved also.  Happy ending was fine for me since I expected it would be so, though as with most novels I have read over the last several years, I was a little empty with what seemed a simple wrap-up like, they all lived happily ever after.
B006H4DBA4|5.0|I wanted a breezy fun read & that's what I got! I love this author so it was a real treat to find a free one - just wish it wasn't so short.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Paid for this download, but not sure where it downloaded to, or even where to go to find it.  Have a hard time justifying trying to call someone to get help when the cost was so small, spending more time searching it out than it would be worth.  I have other games so don't really miss it.
B00190N4E4|5.0|The movie starts out with the assassination of Gandhi. It then rewinds back to the events prior to his death. It all begins in southern Africa in the year of 1893. Gandhi, a lawyer at the time, is thrown out of a train for refusing to move to third class even though he had purchased a first class ticket. Having realized that Indians are being discriminated upon due to their status and race, he becomes inspired and decides to take action. While in South Africa, Gandhi organizes a few non-violent protests that turn out to be a success. During his return to India, Gandhi is well received and praised by the people. He's hoping to induce such a change in India that will lead to the country's independence from the British Empire. The situation escalates during one of Gandhi's meetings, with the massacre of a vast amount of Hindu followers by the hands of British troops. Gandhi later gives a speech stressing that the only way to gain independence is through Hindu and Muslim unity, removal of untouchability from their hearts and lives, and finally, British defiance. Shortly after, a riot breaks out between Hindus and Muslims. This promotes great disappointment in Gandhi's heart to a point that leads him to fast until the end of the riot. With all the non-violent protest campaigns occurring, Britain finally gives in and grants India her independence. With such great news, also comes conflict that rises due to the division of the country. The news of riots between Hindus and Muslims ignited by this division pushes Gandhi to once again fast. After much fasting, he soon recovers and is unexpectedly shot while on his way to a meeting. Gandhi spent his last days trying to induce peace between both Hindu and Muslims. He believed the only way to change the law was by means of provoking a response. This has a lot to do with World Religions in the sense that Gandhi was a very respected and inspirational man. He had a vast amount of followers who stood by his side during his nonviolent protest campaigns. He claimed that truth and love would always win against tyrants. Not only did Gandhi fight hard for the civil rights of his people but he also preached the importance of nonviolence and unity. Most importantly, he led his country of India to independence, which to this day, continues to be celebrated.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have to say i enjoyed the second half of this book more then the first. It is a bit slow in starting. Once it gains momentum, it takes you into a great murder mystery adventure. I enjoyed trying to put all the pieces together. I would recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i love the game and how real it look my only problem was that it wont load sometimes and i waited a day to play ot again
1579128149|5.0|Beautifully photographed and cleverly written, this book provides an engaging overview of all the elements with informative stories and vignettes written nicely into the text. The hardbound book itself is of superior quality. A bargain at twice the price. I bought this for my son for Christmas, but was captivated by it and ended up reading it all the way through myself before it went under the tree.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|This movie was really good that I would recomend it to my friends and family. For a remake it was great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you read the first two books , Hunger games, Catching Fire  this is a great last book. I wish it would keep going
B00007BK2N|5.0|Great movie chronicaling the exciting life of Tony Wilson and Joy Division/New Order and The Happy Mondays Factory Records operation.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|My 6 and 8 year old girls LOVE this game! They figured out how to play on their own and have gradually advanced and get very excited when they master each level. Hours of fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great graphics are good and fun!!!! You can change characters and buy new hoverboards!! Totally worth downloading
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Loaded the game a few times. It never worked. Always said the game has stopped working. I just went ahead and uninstalled it.
0765325950|5.0|Awesome end to a wonderful series. Didn't disappoint. Am going to re-read the entire series now. If you have read the first 13 books you have to read this one.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Easy to learn and provides more hours of entertainment than the kids Nabi tablets hold the charge! At least the fun lasts longer :)
B00009YOQW|5.0|Received for Christmas for my son (born Nov. 2011.  So, 13 months at Christmas).  He has played with it, literally, everyday since opening it.  I have been inclined to write a review because I despise most of the toys in my home that make noise.  This little drum, this tiny, beautifully made, simple drum is a welcome 'noise'.  It doesn't annoy, it's isn't deafening and, dare I say it?...I think it is much more educational than all those toys that flash, blink, scream and repeat the same songs over and over and over. Tonight, however, I had to write a review.  3 days ago I found this little drum in a sink of water.  Submerged.  It had been there for probably an hour.  I dried it out and gave it back to my son tonight.  It's fine.  It is as if nothing ever happened.<br /><br />I don't pretend to be a musician but I see how my son tries to affect tone by hitting certain parts of the drum (I found him hitting the side of the drum tonight. He was surprised by the different sound and concentrated very hard to hit the same spot. )<br /><br />The only downside is that I constantly have to take away the drumstick from him because he likes to walk around while chewing on it...not safe for a wobbly, barely-walking kiddo. That is not a reflection on the toy itself, just a safety reminder if you have a freaky weird fear that your kid is going to knock his teeth out like I do:)
B0017SWPXY|4.0|While it seems kind of cute, writing a book through the eyes of a dog, I found the book to be thought provoking and especially to promote peace rather than revenge in difficult circumstances.  Something our world and media very seldom does.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Good action, but no real story.  Basically just Jeremy Renner running around beating people up.  The characters are superficially interesting, but that's it.
B001GWK2MC|5.0|Awesome for the younger set, ours is 2 and at her birthday we had 2-5 year olds. We just kept the time in separate n everyone had fun.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Kind of thought it would be a fiesty girl out to prove her independence (based on the trailers).  It was actually a fiesty girl trying to fix a problem (no spoiler alert).  Could have done a much better job.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|This was an amazing read for me...I cried, laughed, and sat in introspection. While I know it was Aristotle philosophy it was a great book to read for a time in my life that I needed validation for my feelings of uninteresting in a shallow life. Hope you enjoy :)
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|About half way through I thought, &#34;Uh, this is kind of nuts...&#34;  Great story and very well done.  But yeah, more disturbingly violent than any animation I have so far, including japanese anime.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|This is a well written historical novel.  Followed closely to her other novels, but focused on the different cousins during this period.  Gives a more indepth look at the female characters.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I appreciate the patriotic themes that are displayed throughout the show. It makes for interesting science fiction and they aren't afraid to discuss topics like God and faith.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The novel was a light romance.  Easy to read.  Good characters but predictable plot.  A typical Nicholas sparks novel.  Enjoyable.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel did a good job, but the subject line was disturbing and the movie was mostly a downer.  Not something you want to see before flying!  I guess it makes you appreciate how people struggle with addiction, though.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|thus far I'm enjoying this - good graphics and not too much work! good way to pass the time and not have to think too hard.
B007IK44CK|4.0|I like action adventure super spy thrillers,and the irony of Mission Impossible is everything is possible the super spy's accomplish! Stunts keep one on the edge of the seat at times, I won't get too technical in this review either.Good show.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I dont know why other people seem to despise this film, but for myself I found it quite disturbing. After getting shot off the train Bond seems changed, drinking Rolling Rock beer, my favorite as well, living I guess in some Island or Tropical location that is off the map as though he has lost his nerve. M is under the gun to explain the latest disaster to befall the MI-6, actually a  plot against M herself. For a while you don't know if Bond, grizzled and looking like something the cat has brought in, is OK upstairs. He looks old and tired and you get the feeling that the person looking to destroy M, may well succeed and Bond while not playing dead, is out of touch and lets people think that if they wish., the last words from M he knew was for a stationary agent to take a shot and take out the traitor that Bond is fighting with one a fast moving trains roof attempting to retrieve what amounts to is a complete list of agency's spies and it seems to be connected to some decision M made in the past as cryptic messages tell her to confess her sins.  But it is Bond who is hit, feeling betrayed by someone who he thought had his back and had faith in him, that he wasn't trusted to finish his assignment and that M*s course of action could have been a fatal one, Bond is shaky upon his return, unable to shoot straight or make it thru a series of tests to see if he is stil lup to snuff and we don't know if he has something in mind for M himself in way of payback. The movie is not typical Bond, its more about the character of the people who work for the M-16 and whether under M they are fighting today's spy wars with yesterdays tactics.<br /><br />  There are tense moments all along yet the action scenes are tepid, I will grant the less then thrilled folks that, but its not the action that this movie is about. Its about the old world and the new world of counterintelligence and the irony of M being in the same position as Bond. Of being shot down to avoid any more catastrophesfor which she takes full responsibility and intends to correct before her forced retirement. Like Bond she too feels that she has not been given the fair chance to fix this dire threat.<br /><br />  All in all it was an interesting psychological piece on Bond and M, and what happens when they are questioned by their employers for whom they have worked hard and never let down. Till the finale epilogue I was certain that this was where Bond having had enough was going to retire. Im going to miss Judi Dentch as M. I dont know what I think of the new Q, who seemed quite green and wet behind the ears.<br />  So yes between the shootings and chases I did find a very disturbing mental profile that one can extract as one sees it, about Bond and M that make the movie a must see.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! In standard Martin fashion, things happen constantly and it reminds me of a tv show.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the most exciting and beautiful shows on television!  The acting is superb, the plots exciting and suspenseful as well. I have always loved Masterpiece Theater productions. This one is incredible!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! In standard Martin fashion, things happen constantly and it reminds me of a tv show.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed the game while doing free trial. Wish they would make more a purely free ones ironed that once you buy it you get sequels free.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! In standard Martin fashion, things happen constantly and it reminds me of a tv show.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a GREAT movie!!  Clean and VERY funny!  Great for everyone kids and adults! We will be buying this one!!!
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|There was a lot of action, but, that was about it... The movie was pretty hard to follow as to what they were trying to accomplish.
B007TKBE40|5.0|Love his sound its so addicting to listen to and playing it on vinyl just seems right for this album.<br /><br />Got this on vinyl shipping was fast as always and record was packaged well so no damaged occurred. Vinyl is thick and it is a book style sleeve. Great price
B003THHIEM|5.0|I enjoy the insightful banter in this series. I must also admit that Nathan is very nice to watch at work. I also like the fact that the male star of the show does not have to be the macho stereotype.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|One Foot In The Grave (Night Huntress #2) by Jeaniene Frost<br /><br />Cat & Bones continued<br /><br />This is my second time reading this book and it didn't get any easier to digest!!!  Ms. Frost was breaking my heart at the end of the last book and sustained the break at the opening of this one.  What a great story; tons of action, sex, comedy, and foul language to keep me glued to the kindle screen!!  Nothing too dark, but the story sure does take some extreme twists... I think you'll like it!<br /><br />I was glad to see the introduction of more \\"important\\" future characters and the use of them.  As always Cat had me in stitches just reading the banter between her and her team.. love me some Tate, Juan, and Cooper!!!  Don, eh, he could kiss my butt for all I care... he's not one of my faves... but Bones.. oh Bones, he's got me wrapped around his beautiful creamy white pinky finger!!!  Definitely a panty dropper for me!!!  Cat also has the most amazing best friend in Denise... She's so accepting of Cat and her heritage, I just love that girl!  Now Justina... that woman just gets on my last damn nerve... Seriously, a mother acting like that... she needs a swift kick in the butt if you ask me!<br /><br />I was glad to see this one taking more steps forward then back... I feel like Cat and Bones actually accomplished something this time.  Dealing with Master Vamps, being under a Master's line, how to get out of one, How to capture a vamp vs. killing one.  Very good story Ms. Frost!  The book (kindle version) was 384 pages and well worth the discounted price of $4.74... I will forever cherish this series and one of the ones that broke me into the vampire world!<br /><br />5 STARS
1451683405|4.0|I actually listened to the audio book version of this from audible.  Sam Harris does a fantastic job of reading his own book.  This is a pretty short book and the audio book was a little over an hour long, but was very unique.  For the lack of pages/audio I don't want you to think the book doesn't cover a lot of material because it is fairly deep when it comes to the idea of free will.  I don't want to give away too much, but basically the book talks about how free will is an illusion and doesn't exist.  I realize some people might not appreciate that topic and wouldn't enjoy a book that talks about such a thing, but if you want to see the world from a different set of eyes this is very interesting.
0792839749|5.0|Very cheap but so worth it! Works perfectly, nothing wrong at all with it.<br />Came very quickly in the mail.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is pretty cool and yeah so this is my review! loved it so much will play for a long time
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|We read this with my book club.  During our read time Sandy Hook happened. Needless to say our discussion was lively and heated. The writing style took me a little while to get used to but her storyline is so gripping it became hard to put down. Every mother wonders what they would do in this mothers position....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing and has good grapics.so if you love horses i recommed this app.i love playing on this app!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|this app is worth every penny you pay! i almost own the whole set of the flippix chain and I find it to be relaxing and enjoyable every time I play. definitely give it five stars!!!! fun for all ages and be warned it can become addictive! !!
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Great move. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Met req limit.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game is very much like the show with how the ponies are and there are lots of things to do in the game.
0765325950|5.0|Finally Closure to a very huge series!<br />From page 1 to the ending never a dull moment... Battles, destruction and you do not know until the end how it will turn out.<br />Way to Go!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't know much about the series when I started watching it. I actually heard Joan Rivers mention it & that peaked my interest.  I love this series, it is so different from what is popular on tv right now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton abbey has to be one of my favorite shows and I love the ease of watching it at the Click of a button.
B007R108WA|2.0|I was expecting this movie to be different than most & I was right! It was pretty slow moving but not a bad movie if you are looking to kill some time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My son would read this book all day and night until he finished the book he said it was a real page turner
0761536434|5.0|If you like video games and want to learn about their colorful past, then buy this book. Really, you wont be disappointed.
B004U52VPS|2.0|I bought this game as a gift for someone, but when I got it in the mail it was clearly used. I had purchased it &#34;new&#34;, and there's a sticker on the box saying that it's new...but it clearly is not. The box is really worn in, and there is tape all over it. When I opened it, all the pieces were there...but the cards were thrown underneath, and there were no directions! Please don't sell me a used game, when I purchased a new one. Very unsatisfied, and I am returning it. First time I ever had to return an item from Amazon.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a complicated, page turning book. I absolutley love it and cannot wait to read the next one in the series. The TV show also follows very closely, which is a nice surprise. I would recommend this  book to anyone with a hunger for reading. This is a long book, so don't expect to get through it on a weekend. ;)
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I like all Lee Child's book each book I have read. He keeps me wanted to turn each page not want to put the book down. I can picture in my mind the story,I am reading, almost like I'm telling the story or there. I like that Lee Child don't give to much details that is not needed. I would suggest his books to anyone.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game.  This is the runningest guy I have ever seen.  The game is not altogether mindless so it does keeps me interested.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game!!!  Ive never played a game like this before. Just match 3 for money to build the perfect fish tank and I'm addicted!  However... after a while you cant go on to more trophies or tanks because you have to buy the full version. 5 dollars is a bit much for a game but let me know when it goes on sale.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It was a compelling read in the sense that I wanted to find out what happened next, but I did not care for the book at all, and wish I would have checked it out from the library and not bought a copy.  You win some you lose some. I thought the novel was disturbing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game is kind of fun. I got it for my niece and she loves it. I give it three stars she gives 5
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Me and my husband absolutely love it. We watched all first season in one week to catch up. Maggie Smith is superb.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love this movie and the blu-ray definitely is the way to watch it. Worth the extra to get blu-ray
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app on my kindle fire for my kids. They loved the first one and love this one even more! Great entertaining app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found myself to to see who would survive and what would happen next. Excellent series- can't wait to start reading the next in the series.
B00683JK9K|5.0|These are the best puzzles! I have purchased a few types and like these the best. First off, the pieces are off to the side in a column where you can see them and choose which piece you want to place. I like to do the border first! Very organized without pieces all over the place.  The pictures are very pretty and the HD graphics are great! Challenging but not hard. Get it!!! Enjoy~
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very fun game. It shows you that taking care of a horse is not easy, but it is worth it and it is fun. The part of this app that is not the greatest is that you run out of diamonds an  money pretty fast. But saga over great game!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I'd not heard about the Jack Reacher novels until after I saw the movie starring Tom Cruise.  I found out there are about ten books in the series and went to Amazon to order book #1.  I was not disappointed.  I read fiction and watch movies with only one goal in mind:  to be entertained.  And \\"Killing Floor\\" will keep you on the edge of your mental seat every page of the way.<br /><br />I am now midway through the second novel.  I've already reviewed it with one star.  I cannot get past the fact that Lee Childs does not know his political left from his political right.  Adolph Hitler was not the leader of the National Capitalists; he led the National Socialists and that is as 'left' as it gets.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Stupid movie. Silly plot. Actually we rented it by mistake. Don't waste your time and money. It won't be difficult to find something better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Like all social networking institutions, trivial is as trivial does. If you think looking at 436 pictures of shoes every day makes you a shallow person, POOF!, you're a shallow person. However, if you're like me and aren't hung up on things that steal my own joy, then this app is for you. Everything is beautiful and no one gets hurt. The peace of mind I used to find in the tumblr community is now bountifully plentiful in pinterest.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My nephew likes this game. We play it together. It shows how much work goes into having a horse. He likes to play with the horse.
B00821PCJS|4.0|My husband and I are thoroughly enjoying this show!  We have been looking for an entertaining show that doesn't insist on throwing in sex scenes and cleavage, and, aside from a few minor infractions in that dept., it's been very good.  It's not high art, but it's a fun show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting!!!!!!!!!!! I love this game.I play it all the time with may friends. I really really really love it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon (i.e. Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Angel). Firefly was recommended by a few people who love sci-fi. Its a great series, has a little bit of everything. Interesting storyline, acting is suburb, its comedic, romantic, action-packed, nerdy and creative. Definitely worth renting and/or buying.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Even my mom likes it...I mean l Don't blame her it is a lot of fun but that proves that the game is fun for all ages but she sometimes takes over my kindle. I will be happy with it any way.

B005H9B44A|3.0|I'm tired of evil (the Ice Men) characterized as (pick one) monsters or the Devil.<br /><br />I'm tired of intergalactic travel (or whatever it was) portrayed with noisy roaring machinery and flashing lights.<br /><br />Portrayal of purported government intervention was the same as every other sci-fi/fantasy portrayal of government intervention.<br /><br />But it was still entertaining on an otherwise sleepless night.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is one of my favourite authours who rarely ever disappoints. This was quite a surprising plot and I anticipate the next Mitch Rapp book.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Within the first few minutes of the movie, R rated nudity scene comes to the rescue to grab the attention of the viewer. Then I recall the 5 min. scene of the flight scene, which was just acceptable in terms of movie effects. Then, many viewers will be turning their smartphones, to see if there is something else. For those who are awake, there is the redemption at the end of the movie. \\"Powerful\\" ... not really.  Not the best material from DW.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I Love this Pac Man Lite game.  I have always loved to play Pac Man and this sort of has me reliving my childhood days:)  I would recommend it to my friends and family members that have a kindle!!  It is simply an amazing game!!
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|I didn't think the acting was so great and the script certainly was sub-par. With great movies like Argo and Lincoln around, why would this get four stars. I'm sorry I wasted a Redbox freeble on this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfer rocks. Free version is great. I love this game and it keeps getting better. I recommend Subway Surfer.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was available as a free download due to Prime membership--yet another superb advantage of this fabulous program.  Prime Membership is a great conveniences and advantages.  Worth every penny many times over.  And Downton Abbey?  Well, you know how fabulous it is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|quick read, happy ending I enjoyed it<br />All three books were enjoyable, I would recommend them.  Not what I expected
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Action Pack! HD at it best. If you like fast action then this is the movie for you. Like the other Mission Impossibles, good job.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Had me thinking about how many shades I am as well as my husband.  Well written and thought provoking, just a excellent book.
0307744434|1.0|This book, despite all the hype, was a huge disappointment.  The writing style is jerky, jarring, and difficult to follow.  The characters are flat, static, and undeveloped.  The plot is unappealing and difficult to follow at times.  By the time I finally got to the halfway point in the book, I was confused, bored, fed up with the uninteresting characters, and ready for the circus to pack up and move on.  This book was a huge disappointment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book just had to move onto the second right away.  Thought provoking and makes you want to relook at what you think is normal.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I've heard nothing but how funny this movie is for months, so I finally rented it thru Amazon.  What a waste of time and money.  Awful cannot even describe how bad this movie is...and I watched the whole thing hoping it would get better somewhere along the line. It did not.
B007MC0IAG|4.0|Like most of Richard Dawkins books this one gives you lots of food for thought, his writing is always precise and interesting.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I would watch this over and over. Love John Wayne! Would recommend this movie to everyone. Good old fashioned western!
1400032717|4.0|I needed this novel for my college English class. I'm only a few chapters in but I love it already. It is about a boy named Christopher and he is autistic. Learning how he views the world around him is sometimes sad, but very interesting because you learn more about autism and how autistic people perceive things.
B0095P29EG|4.0|First time we saw this movie. Very entertaining and exciting. A little slow in the beginning but finished strong. I would recommend watching.
B0084670FU|5.0|Brad Pitt at his finest - Production, Directing and Acting keeps the viewer riveted to the screen. It's movies like Babel that makes being an Amazon Prime Customer well worth the investment.

B004TI5N38|5.0|I love the way David Baldacci writes.  Keeps one on their toes and goes very fast with the words.  Keeps right to the point.
B00AF6B22E|2.0|In Flight, Denzel Washington plays boozer alcoholic jet pilot Whip Whitaker who is always living on the edge of disaster. Frequently before flights, he drinks himself into oblivion, then snorts lines of cocaine to get himself in shape to fly. This occurs sometimes less than an hour before taking the lives of his crew and passengers into his hands.<br /><br />In the opening minutes of the film, Whip's routine jet flight takes a turn for the deadly when his plane carrying 102 passengers experiences a mechanical failure which causes it to nosedive towards the ground. Making an unorthodox and risky aerial manuever, Whip is able to crashland the plane with minmal loss of life. Of course, after the accident, a NTSB investigation team arrives and one of the first things they find is that Whip's blood shows that he was intoxicated and high on cocaine at the time of the crash. Suffice it to say, things don't look good for Whip.<br /><br />Flight asks a great question of the viewer. Should Whip get out of his predicament because he saved the lives of almost all of his passengers and crew, or should he be punished for his substance abuse? It's a tough question, and it's one that Denzel's character wrestles with most of the movie. I mean, yeah, he might be able to beat the charges and walk away a hero, but then again, if he gets off, eventually his boozing and drugging are going to get people killed. It's just a matter of time. It's an age old question really. Does one heroic act make up for criminal behavior. Should he be forgiven? Should he be able to beat the system. Does his saving of 96 lives make up for the fact that over his career, he has put thousands if not tens of thousands of lives at risk? The more I think about it, to me the answer is NO.<br /><br />Denzel Washington has been nominated for Best Actor for his role as Whip, and I would have to say he might win it, because the Academy has a soft spot for roles portraying drug addicts and the mentally and physically disabled. But he's gonna face stiff competition in the form of Daniel Day Lewis, who I predict will ultimately win the award. The problem with Flight is that too often when Denzel gets drunk in this movie, it almost comes off as comedy or even a parody of alcoholism. It isn't helped by John Goodman's farcical take on a drug supplier that makes the audience laugh. Some people say it's not pleasant to be around a drunk. I would codify that more. It's ANNOYING. They get on your nerves. Everytime Whip got wasted in Flight, I was like rolling my eyes and muttering \\"OMG, do I have to see this AGAIN!\\". When you see him fall into a coffee table, instead of being horrified, it strikes you as akin to a Saturday Night Live sketch.<br /><br />There's also an underlying religious theme at work in Flight as well. Time and again we are reminded that God Himself is making this movie happen. That God caused the deaths of the innocent people on the plane just so Whip could be taught a lesson. That part came off as so much hogwash. That God would allow people to die just so a drunk scumbag could see the truth of his life. Ugh.<br /><br />It was nice to see Bob Zemeckis try his hand again at live action moviemaking instead of his bizarre and disturbing experimentation with performance capture, which I feel had driven him to a 10 year dead end. He's like George Lucas, but to an even worse extreme. But unlike George, I feel that Bob could return to making good movies if he tried. Much like Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi in the gloriously flawed Prometheus, I think Bob is rusty at doing what he used to be one of the best at. Here's hoping his next film will be better.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Dear Gameloft,<br /><br />I don't know why some of your older games aren't compatible for kindle fire. This is really annoying because some of them seem really<br />cool and I would be willing to buy. Can you please at least put some of them back on. Thanks
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love that there are 5 pages of sounds, including binaural beats,  to choose from on this app. you can adjust the volume of individual sounds, play multiple sounds simultaneously,  and you have the option to play the sounds on a timer or indefinitely. I wish some of the musically based sounds were more than a few repeating measures, but that might be ideal for someone else. overall, a fantastic app.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think it was great.Greg Heffly is funny,and he's always looking for girls.When I read this book I imagined it was really real

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app it is sooooooooooooo fun and challenging I love love love love love love this fun app
B0026KX5PO|4.0|This is a dark film with lots of homage to the thriller/mystery genre films. It's sort of a psychological piece, but you never fully understand why Mr. Ripley is as messed up as he is. You get clues, and they do help support the plot, but you're left feeling a little in the dark sometimes. This is a nice departure for Matt Damon, who typically plays the good guy.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Personally I love this game. It's really fun but too easy for me. I restarted the whole game 3 times already and the Doodle God 2 needs to come on Amazon.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|IT'S A BASIC CALCULATOR. I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS ON THE KINDLE (LARGE) MY EYES ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Fantastic follow up. I wish I had gotten into this series after all the books were written, I hate waiting!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great way to kill time! Fun game. If you like SIM city of comes highly recommended!<br />Great for travel and road trips!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would get this game compared to the original the other one sucked this one has better graphics and more stuff to do.too bad it dosent have all the people.but still five stars
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun. Keeps me busy for hours, Hope to think it sharpens my mind too.Colors are bright and fun too.
0765325950|3.0|BAM! It's over... But what happened after ? People died, what happened to the hiers ? How did the kingdoms continue on ? What of the seanchan ? One of the great things about endings is when the story ends we generally know what happened to the people after the final battle/event/etc. But this ? It's ridiculous, its as if the publishers or Jordans widow put some major pressure on Sanderson to finish the book up double time and left little room for an epilogue.<br /><br /> It was just extremely disappointing, there at the end, we all were left with nothing but questions, to which there are no answers.
031237674X|5.0|I used to have a weak belief in reincarnation based on an experience in my own family.  However, Mr. Tucker's objective and thorough research has led me to give more credence to the possibility of past lives.  I should add that it was great reading this book after reading Carol Bowman's Children's Past Lives.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great game for kids.  If my son cannot solve a puzzle he aks for help and then solves it himself the next timw.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read Gone Girl and just had to find another book by this author.  It's a great read that I highly recommend my only complaint is that it was too short.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you're even a tiny bit of an Anglophile you'll love this series. If you're a fan of Dame Maggie Smith you'll love this series. If you're looking for something to watch that doesn't treat you like an idiot, please watch it. You'll be glad that you did.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My six year old loves animals and especially horses.  She really likes this game.  Parent assistance is needed for reading the tutorials and getting her stated, but after that she's gotten the hang of it pretty well.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read the first two books in the hunger games trilogy and couldn't put them down. This one not so much. I felt it dragged on a lot and she exaggerated a lot of katniss feelings and thoughts just to fill space. Obviously if you're reading the trilogy you'll want to read the last book but to me it fell very short.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I feared that the second book would fail to live up to the first, but I was happily wrong.  Great job.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game deserves ten stars!! it's  so cool! I can clean my horses stable and groom my horse! download  this! !!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love the series, but the final book's characterization of the major characters was a disappointment.  I felt it was rushed and not as well structured as the first two.  I still enjoyed it, but wished that the romance could have been better handled.  The final fight was only slightly interesting.  Perhaps it was because I read all three books in one long weekend.<br /><br />Still, I do recommend the series.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I recently bought this game. I was a little reluctant at first, because I'm usually a little iffy with drawing games. They usually have a lot of glitches. So I bought this, taking a risk. I love it so much because it's totally responsive to my Kindle Fire screen, and I can draw literally anything I want with all of the drawing materials. There's marker, paint, crayon, colored pencil, stamp markers, stickers, and background paper. It's so easy to use... Definitely worth the pay!
B0058O84G0|5.0|This is not the first Ken Follett book I read.<br />And each time I take one of his books, I simply can't stop reading it.<br />In Fall of Giants, I love the way Follet describes the era of WW I.<br />It is extremely interesting to learn about the history and fun learn about it through this book.<br />I also loved to get familiar with the way the simple (and rich) people lived.<br />It is a fun history book.<br /><br />I recommend !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a good game because you unlock new people and new skateboards. pwow it isxthe best game I ever played
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.  I am still thinking about the ending.  I might reread it to get more clues.
B0070P95K4|5.0|What do you do if you have everything you \\"should\\" want and are still unhappy? In Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert shares her story of leaving it all - a promising career, a comfortable home, and even her marriage - to travel the world in search of happiness. Like Cecilia Ahearn, I expected Elizabeth Gilbert to be too \\"girly\\" or emotional of an author for me and was pleasantly surprised. Of course, the book includes many emotional topics, such as the author's agonizing divorce proceedings, but she describes everything in a relatable, humorous way. She comes across as very down-to-earth and comfortable laughing at herself and never became too angsty.<br /><br />The people described in the book are just priceless. They're so unique and so interesting that it shocked me in the middle of the book to remember they were real. They just make for such a good story that it's hard to believe they weren't invented expressly for the purpose of being in the book. Something others have pointed out correctly is that this isn't really a travel memoir, because the focus is these characters not the locations. You get a little bit of a feel for the culture of each place the author stays, but the physical journey is definitely secondary to the emotional journey the author experienced.<br /><br />The organization of the book was a tiny bit contrived and the division of the author's time in each country into an equal number of stories sometimes made the pacing uneven. I'd just be getting into the plot connecting the chapters and suddenly I'd reach a section where the chapters were individual stories. Despite the occasional lack of flow, I was hooked on this one. The short chapters made it easy to indulge my desire to find out what happened next by reading just one more chapter. And then one more. And then another, late into the night.<br /><br />Like the other characters, the author seemed like too good of a protagonist not to have been made up for that express purpose. She reminded meof Meg Cabot's characters, managing to be both fun and relatable enough to make me think \\"I could be friends with her\\". At the end of the day, that reputability and the character driven narrative were what drove my late-night reading binges. Highly recommended.
B0084670FU|4.0|It wasn't hard to determine where this movie was going (6 degrees of separation) but after watching the moving I concluded the best part of the journey was the anticipation of what &#34;might&#34; happen to the characters.  Good acting (not sure why the ad claims &#34;Brad's Pitt's Best Performance&#34;) and nice job building suspense although some people might be disappointed if they were hoping for a different ending to the individual stories.  Enjoy...
1400052181|4.0|I admit, I approached this book expecting an entirely one-sided account, very anti-science. What I was most impressed with at the end was the even-handed treatment this topic received. Although it is clear that the family was treated poorly and with little compassion, it is less clear who should have what sort of rights to tissue samples taken at hospitals today. To help us see both sides of the issue, the author shares with us the opinions of many doctors and scientists on both side of the issue. The author clearly spent copious amounts of time interviewing the Lacks family and the specialists, because she seamlessly incorporates quotes from both into her narrative. In addition to learning about Henrietta, we get to know the backgrounds of many of the people who touched her life. These tangential background stories also melded seamlessly with the main story.<br /><br />The organization of the book was perfect, switching back and forth between the past and the present easily. A time line at the beginning of the chapter kept me from getting lost and the integration of Henrietta's story and that of her cells helped keep the connection between the two at the front of my mind. The author also does an impressive job integrating the science behind Henrietta's cells, with enough simple analogies that I could easily see how a book on a somewhat esoteric topic went main stream.  Before wrapping up, I believe I should warn you that their were a few sexual assault scenes that totally caught my off guard but which were part of the family's history. Other than that, what stood out to me most about this book was the incredibly diversity of topics covered. All of these topics - the family history, the family today, the science, the ethics issues, the lives of the researchers - were integrated extremely well and were always fascinating to read about.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Enjoyed it - made for a good movie night. need more words to submit  - who came up with this minimum # needed?
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is all about the singing style and voice of the artist.  She could sing anything and it would sound great.  It's slow, soft, soothing music.  When I first heard it, had to own it,
B001J1S4F2|4.0|Good movie. It has a very twisted plot which makes very interesting . It is awesome to watch. I have watched it several times.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Interesting time travel type of story. Not the typical Stephen King fare though the results of saving Kennedy had King-like implications. The story itself was pretty compelling and kept me wanting to finish the book.
B008Q086AC|5.0|Great movie, amazing performance by Samuel L. Jackson. Recommend to anyone. It was not was I expecting but turned out to be better.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A wonderful book. Excellent incite on all the cabinet members and of course Lincoln. Very interesting perceptions on personal relationships that these powerful people had.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I bought the app and it will not even let me download the rest of it! it stole my money!!
B00AFEY354|5.0|I'll be getting the movie in the mail in a few days. I can't wait to share this with everyone I know. It's excellent.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Mesmerizing - watched all episodes in one night! The actors were perfectly cast for their roles.I can't wait for season 4!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so different from temple run 1 it has more variety in the course and is much more fun because it has many other options too. I recommend it strongly especially to those who loved the first temple run
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I didn't think that they could pull off a 3rd MIB and have me enjoy it just as much as the first two, but, they did. The acting job by Josh Brolin as a young Agent K was nothing short of superb.....he nailed the voice and expression of Tommy Lee Jones!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Well besides the fact I love angry birds it's fun and cool plus it's many levels for free. It's not disappointing
B004SIP8SY|4.0|I am a fan of Uma Thurman. Add in the supporting cast, action and, yes, even humor, to this twisted revenge movie and I can watch it over and over even though I know the outcome!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I updated my kindle last night and now it won't even open! Very upset as I paid for some of those books. Please fix! It worked before I updated. I enjoy the kindle app but recently the updates are so big I had to choose between some other apps to put the update in. Going to delete and re-install. If it doesn't work I'm calling custmer service for my money back on the books I paid for.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|This is one of the rare times that a movie equals an original hit TV Series without having to give any credit to the advancements in filming or special effects....this movie holds its own on acting and directing. The performances of Harrison Ford & Tommy Lee Jones were spectacular and director Andrew Davis did a great job of telling the story in just a few hours.<br /><br />As big of a Harrison Ford fan as I am, Tommy Lee Jones stole the show....his mix of humor and seriousness drew you in to liking him so much that you wanted him to catch Ford, even though he was wrongly accused. His speech after the train wreck is a classic!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Mr Follett takes excellent care to present a story about people and placeing tem in what happened. This is the second book in a trilogy and I enjoyed reading the continuing saga. Most of all I really love relearning the events of an importatnt era, the time of WWII and what led up to it and why so much loss of life became necessary inn order to restore sanity to a world gone mad. I look forward to the third book with great anticipation. Mostly to see what the people he created do next.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|I am not one of those Tarantino fans that thinks he can't do anything wrong (although I DO like most of his work!), however, Kill Bill is one of his best. I AM a HUGE Uma Thurman fan and when you combine her with the rest of female villains that are ALL easy on the eyes and do an excellent job of playing their twisted roles, you have a clear winner!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey knocked it out of the park with this one.  It is absolutely an instant science fiction classic in my book. I should mention as well, as much as it is science fiction in time and place, its a true piece about people and how we interact with one another. Howey does such a great job in vividly describing this place and these people in a way that was so easy to see in my head, that I truly felt I was living along side them and going through their struggles.  Pacing and twists came at a perfect pace and the suspense at the end of some of the chapters had me putting sleep on the back burner just to find out what awaited the many beloved characters you meet along the way.<br /><br />Bravo Hugh! I will be following your work closely from now on!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great app. its alot of fun and it is definitely very additive. its easy to understand so its great for children 6 and up
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose this book because everyone recommended it & I was definately not disappointed! Alot of Nicholas Sparks books are way to sad for me but this way a great read! Looking forward to the movie this week.
B008X6JP3G|4.0|Good story and good acting. Could have made the action a little more intense but it does manage to hold your attention. I did like the final meeting of Costner and Quinn.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I saw the movie in theaters and when I came home I had to buy the soundtrack. I listen to it all the time. It's wonderful!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely awesome! Just when you think you are reading a typical romance novel, it throws in twists you never see coming. I could not put it down!!!
B007MU85D0|4.0|If you like Mumford and Sons or the Lumineers, you'll probably love Of Monsters and Men. The entire album is enjoyable, not just their hit singles :)
B0085TKAW6|3.0|This book was interesting to read and all the characters had big stories but didn't engage me as much as the first book. Interested to see how the Author goes for his third book.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34;. I enjoyed the simultaneous plots because I like to be challenged. The death of a character running through it gave it some poignancy. As a first attempt after a series of wildly successful children's books, I thought J.K. Rowling did a passable job.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is great! I only have one criticism: THIS APP WONT LOAD! IT CLOSES DoWN! I know most reviews don't say this, but its true.<br /><br />  Thank You For Reading My Reveiw.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so AWESOME. I can't even believe that it's a real game! I suggest that you get this cool app. I really like this app because you have so much to do with it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Typical scifi premise of invasion by a technologically superior and destructive alien enemy of mankind and humankinds response against what seems like overwhelming odds.
0765325950|5.0|Very great book. The whole series is awesome, even though it is written by two different authors. Great finish. Thanks
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This man has so much talent and this album shines. It is very well produced, excellent sound quality, and a talented backing band showcase the brilliance of these songs. Leonard Cohen himself sounds fantastic, all time worn and warm at the same time, love this.

B0063GORYU|3.0|One of my favorite games on my regular computer, however, do not enjoy it near as much on the small screen of the Kindle Fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The plot was so intricate that I had to keep watching.  The characters were fascinating. The show just flew by quickly.
B0040I09RM|4.0|You will love this series snd the story line between the cast of characters ...great to be wstching it on demand since there is no waiting to find out what happens next...
B0086213XW|2.0|With Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman, I automatically assumed I'd be watching a good comedy.  Instead I found a dreary, drama-ish, tale of searching for greener pastures instead of making the most of what you have.  It felt awkward.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love these types of games. Always fun for my son and I to figure out together. G5 always comes through with great graphics and an excellent story line. Looking forward to the next one in this series.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|Stutter and crashing are still problems in delivering streaming video.  Better than in December, but not on par with NetFlix.  (Note that I am on FIOS, 35/25 and experience these problems over wireless or LAN.)
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I ordered this CD for Christmas for my Dad, and I'm not sure who likes it more, him or me. It is definitely a great CD with some killer music. I had only heard the song I Gotsta Get Paid before buying this, and was even more impressed with the rest of the album. If you like ZZ Top, rock music, or good music in general, I highly recommend this CD.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Her voice mesmerizes me. I can't seem to get enough of it. Very old time sultry. Her music is sexy and relaxing.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|This is a very good film, with good writing and fine performances... and an airplane crash scene that is one of the best ever put on film (okay, digital media).  Assured direction by Robert Zemeckis (who also directed \\"Forest Gump\\", \\"Cast Away\\", \\"Contact\\" and \\"Back to the Future\\") and an intelligent, MATURE plot, and actual dialogue and character development (wow, what a concept in today's world of rehashed action/adventure movies) make this easy to recommend.  Those of you who are criticizing the film because (gasp) it has nudity (one scene) and cuss words (hello? it's rated \\"R\\"), or who think it was \\"slow\\", need to stick to movies for children and tweens.  Seriously.  It's an adult drama about one man's struggle with alcoholism.  I found it ultimately inspiring.  Denzel Washington's performance is excellent, and he has a fine supporting cast.  Overall grade: B+.
0307887960|5.0|I have been struggling with 20 lbs for about a year! I am over 40 and nothing seemed to work until a friend recommended this book to me! It was the easiest plan to follow, I dropped 25 lbs, and now weigh what I weighed in college! I did not lose any muscle mass, and went from 27% bodyfat to 19% bodyfat ! Love it, and have kept it off for 6 months now!
B0095P3ULC|1.0|This movie was terrible.  No plot, action was written by a 10 yr old Shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name I'm not going to bother to look up can't act and wasn't much to look at either.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|Great album with songs that will last forever. I can do without some of the live-stage theatrics but stil a great album.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|If you're looking for a few good spooky scares, this is the film for you! Not all horror films have to be fast moving or gory, there should be some storyline, albeit being a bit slow, but always keeping your interest. Daniel Radcliff has definitely come a long way! So, turn off all the lights and hit the play button! Picture and sound quality are both very good!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a very well written and acted TV series. The Wild West in space, the stories are intriguing and the acting engaging. Just the right blend of quirky, clever, intelligent and humorous. Highly reocmmended.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|It's one of the classics of Raygun Gothic. It tries to immerse the viewer in all of its eccentricities and introduces people to its ideas without resorting to exposition when it can. I like it. There's also Robby the Robot!
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|Just an awesome movie to \\"take you back\\", to the time when America was just beginning to discover the off road fun and excitement of motorcycles. This film documents those days. You'll see the old bikes that are now passed into history and seldom seen anymore,...if at all.<br /> I enjoyed trying to identify in my mind the bikes of old,..i.e., Hodaka, Husky, Sachs, CZ, Bultaco,...etc.<br /> A great way to spend a rainy day,...sit back, enjoy, and remminisce about the good ol' days.
B00A757EFW|2.0|It's was really really cheap. Luckily it was free & easy to delete.... save your time by not downloading this free app
B0069SG4W0|5.0|Awesome! With this album and it's layout you can enter the recording room with the Doors. Jim Morrison and band allow you an opportunity to engage in the making of these songs,..there is talk,...joking around,...some insight into the band members individual personas.<br /> The music is classic Doors. Although some lyrics are different and some songs somewhat changed you'll find them all entertaining and a welcome change to the old &#34;cleaned up&#34; tracks produced and distributed back in the day.<br />I find it refreshing and love to spin these vinyls when I'm working in my mancave...
B0056BMK6K|5.0|According to Locke you start marketing. Locke clearly lays out his strategy which is labor intensive but as in the title \\"I sold 1 million ebooks\\" it surely works. Not to give away everything (if I did why would you buy the :) Locke 's main suggestion is to determine your targeted audience and build relationships. If you think about it building relationships take time but good ones last forever. What's great about this book is it puts the process on steroids. Like speed dating with a lasting outcome.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|My intentions in writing this review is not to argue with or to duplicate that which has previously been written. Rather, there is a plethora of commentary on the so-called recent music \\"Big Box\\". This is a very especially well done collection of well written music. I have listened carefully to every disc and all I can do is to thank Liszt, Howard and Hyperion for the many hours of enjoyment they provided me and for the positive thoughts I endured while listening.<br /><br />To my music loving friends, please be assurred that this collection is one of the best I have ever encountered. Furthermore, the price is incredibly reasonably and the production quality is exquisite.
B000W089XS|5.0|Very pleased with the quality on this movie.  Arrived the day before XMAS.  Would purchase & recommend this to all
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am a brain tumor survivor and I found this story fascinating and comforting.  It is the story of a fairly young Neurosurgeon who contracted a rare form of bacterial Meningitis, was in a Coma 6 days, has a near death experience, and recover to tell us what he saw.  If you are struggling with an illness, read this book.  You will be glad you did.  There are a few pages where he gets into the scientific, Neurosurgeon psychobabble that I could have skipped.  But, overall, I enjoyed this book and recommend it to you.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Nice and creepy!  This one makes you think as well as having a few good scares.  There are few horror options that lead you to try to figure out the plot the next day.
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Coach Carter should be on the list of any coach or educator.  It paints a pretty good picture of life at a high school and some of the struggle young adults face these days.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was hard to get into in the beginning.  It is a very slow moving story, but I enjoyed discovering the main characters as the story progressed.
B002RI9PKO|4.0|The extensive research and all the connections he proposes are so interesting and thought-provoking that it made for a real page turner and a great conversation starter.
B0035V35PI|5.0|This is a great marital arts movie and the actors are good looking too. One of the best in a long time
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|It's okay.  There are definitely laugh out loud moments, but for the most part I find myself not very excited to read this book and I'm a huge Tina Fey fan.  If you're expecting something more like SNL or 30 Rock, this isn't it.  I'm not sure what it is, but maybe her humor just reads better on screen.  On the page alone, it feels like something is missing.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|As always well written and engaging. McEwan is one of the best authors alive today.The story has a fascinating ending.
B000SCHC0Q|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book because I liked the Kite Runner.  This book has neither coherence nor power.
0374533571|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK! I laughed, I smiled, I cried. The story of how two people that have been taken from their lovers in the worst ways possible heal each other and their lives.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|By the time I got it and tried it out, the window for returns had closed.  I think it's bull that now I'm stuck with a dvd of a movie I love, that I can't actually watch!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a lot better than what I expected. Looking forward to watching the movie. Recommend this book to anyone.
0307341550|5.0|I read Gillian Flynn's books out of order. This one had me on the edge of my chair, my bed, my car seat (just kidding).<br /><br />I feel like my friends who ever read one of her books, and didn't tell me, may not be friends anymore. I will ask people about this book and they've all read it. No one told me about it! I downloaded this one and her second book after reading \\"Gone Girl.\\"<br /><br />It's amazing to discuss this book with other people. Everyon says the same thing, \\"she has a way of capturing a mood that is so rare.\\" You are biting your nails and dying (pardon the pun) to see who could commit these crimes. This book, just like \\"Gone Girl\\" had me wondering what would happen next.<br /><br />I can't wait to read her next book!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|horribly written there is sex evry 3 seconds and the plot is a pice of s***. ana is bitting her lip rolling her eyes and blushing and flushing repetitively. i bet if you took away all the blushing and lip bitting you would have a decent story 2stars. it would also be 50pages long.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Very good book for the price.  Received as described.  Will probably do business again.  Would recommend to others.  Very satisfied.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Does what It's supposed to do.  Nice and simple. Wish other apps that I have did the same. Also allows downloading other sounds too.
B003U51EE8|4.0|I love this series so far. The downloads sometimes take a little longer than I would like but not a big issue.
B0080MJYR0|1.0|Set back in the time when objectifying women was normal in the movies, Jane Fonda represents a heroine who can think.  I was not able to watch the entire movie because it was so cheesy.  I wish I could have watched it through
B000RZOR2U|5.0|My husband really likes it, he said this is his best Christmas gift ever. The box is great to keep them together.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good read. Not the most literary, but intense and full of meaning. Eight more words required to complete this review.
030758836X|5.0|Loved this book, it was a fast read..great story.  Would highly recommend reading it, it definitely kept my interest to the very last page.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|Damon is great in this movie.  He seems to play very witty types of roles.  This is one of them.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Very good history of the second World War. Beats the others that I have read or seen .Very complete.Parts of the war haven't hit home before seeing this movie.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Great Show just as good as the 1 first season.  Nice that it is free to Prime customers  Thanks Amazon
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I didn't get into Lord of the Rings ,one doesn't have to like every book or movie but this was interesting enought and very easy reading. Adults don't like books with big words all the time. Make believe is wonderful to take the tention away for awhile before heading into the real world again.
1600597963|5.0|If you can only buy one book on bead embroidery for jewelry it should be this one. I have a half dozen bead embroidery books, including the author's previous (and excellent) \\"Beading With Cabochons,\\" but this is the most comprehensive book on the subject to date. It's a book to teach techniques, not a pattern book, though it does have nine projects. The instructions are great and the diagrams are outstanding. And because the publisher is Lark Crafts you can count on quality editing and printing.<br /><br />Most of the techniques in this book can help you with any type of bead embroidery, not just jewelry. This is the one book to get.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A movie that got a lot of attention the year it came out,up for an oscar.Good enough  for me to want to see.Had to know how it came out before I bought it. WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME. I am interested in other things besides my genealogy and family history and this struck my fancy
B00821OX98|4.0|Just watch season 1. LOVE IT. It is well balance between actions and drama. Human relationships and history are nicely interwined
B00821OX98|4.0|This series has an interesting, if not a bit over used, story line that is well acted and executed. The pace drags a bit between significant scenes.
B007P06DOK|4.0|I had seen a television program showing how the Graceland album of Paul Simon came to be and like the music on the tv program.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Great movie and special effects.  I'm not much into sci fi but I enjoyed this and plan on watching the other ones!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|A movie that you can watch  and enjoy.  Also brings back  of those years of history that I watched on TV but didn't know anything about!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Great season of downton abbey, cant wait for the next one to come out. So many twists this season !
030758836X|1.0|I love to read.  I read a lot.  But I do not like to read books that have language like this, and would like to have it rated.  I do not know people who talk like this for which I am grateful.  I did struggle through it, and the story was interesting, and could have been so much better with proper English.
B001XULSG6|5.0|Their best movie. Love this series and the characters. A must see for any Star Trek fan. Patrick Stewart is the best.
B006PTNQGU|3.0|It is a good movie just when you want something to watch without being very intense. That is all I have to say about that
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|After reading the review by HAZ I just had to try this app.  It downloaded on my Kindle Fire quickly with no glitches.  I have a first generation Kindle Fire.  I was amazed at the puzzles even though the review I read had commented on them.  I played the first round and was hooked.  I actually had to stop myself from playing. I especially loved the music. This is a beautiful puzzle game.  I can't wait to get back to it.  Big Fish hit a home run with this puzzle app.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Like countless others, I have been a Batman fan since the 60' and 70's as a boy growing up reading comics. I wished the latest Batman trilogy of live action movies would have gone this route. The leader of the mutants here made Bane look like childs play.<br /><br />I read this graphic novel years ago, and Warren Ellis's version of an older, over-the-hill Batman was intriguing, and really stamped the 'dark' in Dark Knight. DC did a solid job here at re-creating the graphic novel, and not making it childish or stupid, but darker and grittier for adults, as well as keeping it like Ellis wrote it.<br /><br />Can't wait to see Part 2. I hear it is even better.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Laugh out loud funny! It even managed to entertain my two year old daughter for over an hour! Would recommend this movie for anyone looking for a good family movie.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This series is one of the best shows on television with interesting characters and thoughtful plot lines. You can definitely relate to the internal struggles they all go through. Love everything about this show.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run. 2 is an addictive series of jumps, twists and turns that leaves you wanting to run over and over again. Such an improvement over the first Temple Run game. Opportunities to score higher and run further. Highly recommended !
0811833887|5.0|This book had been on my &#34;must-haves&#34; for years and am so glad to have received it. The pictures are beautifully drawn and truly inspiring.
B005PK553C|5.0|Can't wait to watch the next season.  Psychological thriller with believable, strong, likable and unlikable characters with lots of good twists.
B000HKYN74|4.0|A long time TNG fan, I missed critical arcs of both DS9 and Voyager and so was looking forward to Enterprise when it first came out.  Unfortunately life was just too busy and I only saw one or two and thought &#34;meh.&#34;  Going back to watch while streaming, I've enjoyed them.  Some classic trek themes and moral dilemmas, torture to save the world, or no?  Worth watching.  Hard to believe there isn't *some* form of Trek going on anymore.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|If you're kind of whimsical and you love Paris, you'll like this.  Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams are good and it's the familiar Woody Allen charm.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent story.<br />well done with good insight into history, entertaining humor and drama.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this program.<br />can't wait for next season...
B0063GORYU|5.0|very fun if you used this on the computer it works the same and is very enjoyable for me to play
B007GE2H3G|2.0|Animation was terrific--everything else left me, well, unsatisfied.  It would be a great film for kids, except that there's a lot of violence.  The plot and and characters are far too predictable for adults to enjoy . . . so who's left?  People may disagree with me and that's fine, but I didn't enjoy it very much.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Me and my son play the card game when we have family night and I had to try this out and its fun
B005LAJ16I|5.0|What can i say except this is the best show i have ever watched and Season 2 is even better . if you don't have showtime you should purchase this series it is exciting well written and keeps you guessing every minute ... i miss homeland and can't wait for season 3 !!!! the acting is phenomenal and you just never know what's coming next. i love the suspense
B005KELW26|5.0|This is nice to hold the kindle and purple is my favorite color so i like this a lot and it works well
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is an Awesome alarm clock!! I love it. I gave it Five stars. I would wake up with the alarm clock on...
B003OUXECE|4.0|Bioshock: Rapture is an excellent companion novel to the video game series. It's a welcomed addition for any fan that wants to delve deeper into the characters and stories that Rapture has to offer. This easy and enjoyable read made my re-playing of both Bioshock games much more interesting, because I had a greater understanding of Rapture and its beginnings. Highly recommended for fans old and new!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A great game that keeps the kids occupied for hours if I would let them play that long. Great for road trips .
B002BWP49C|1.0|I am sure it would have been great but I never got the dvd, maybe it got lost in the mail or something.  Didn't get a chance to chase it down.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its an awesome game but I changed the resilotion and now I cant even get to the main menu. it just goes back to my kindle screen before it gets past the. loading screen. why wont it work?!?
B0030M3SBI|5.0|If you like Hendrix this is a great live album with Buddy Miles in which the two jam on perfectly.  The songs are all frameworks for each musician's virtuoso abilities.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This book was excellent. I can see why it was considered a classic. I had never read it before and got it because it was free. I will definitely read it again. Lots of action and a great story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been using pintrest for the last few months in planning my childs dinosaur birthday party!  It was a huge success and everyone loved the ideas.  Not to mention they have great ideas for everything from makeup and hair tips to decorating your house.  I love this app.  Def. get it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I had never read the book, though I had seen the movie many times. I really enjoyed it and would read it again.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This CD is awesome.  I had never heard of this band before but took a chance after I heard one of their songs on the radio. I really like the variety of sounds; each song is unique with it's own style.  The songs don't sound all the same like with some artists. You can't go wrong with purchasing this CD, you will not be sorry!  I Love It!
B003L77G6A|5.0|We watch this show as a family. When nothing else is on, we put in a disc and watch episodes that have become our favorites.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Fast moving, easier to understand than the previous MI films.  Very stunning action shots.  The story is believable.  I enjoyed this more than the most recent Bond film.  Took me two tries to lock on, then the streaming was good.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Anything Big Bang is great in our book. We watch this show as a family and wanted to catch up on what we missed.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Although there is good chemistry between Sherlock and Joan Watson, the show can be hard to follow.  Sherlock speaks too fast at times and has a mumbling British accent.  The plots are interesting, but there is no depth in the lives of the other characters.<br />However I plan to watch it next season because I have some hope for the show.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|We watch these episodes over and over. Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, Penny and Howard, we love them all. This show will become a classic;
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this video for my husband for christmas. He loves it and loves the video. it is one of his faves.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have been using this app for about a year on my KF 7, + KFHD 8.7. After using just about every other app out there worth having, I find myself always returning to PicsArt. It is the easiest and most rewarding. Whatever is produced on this app never disappoints. Your motto is so true, with PicsArt everyone becomes an artist. Thank you very much for so many fun and rewarding hours. Nancy Bettac Barton, grammacozy62
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app sucks!!I bet you are wondering why?well here is your reason I tried typing in my password and it said ,&quot;please check your password I think you typed it wrong.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This really is an excellent look at thinking outside of the box.  Billy Beane has made the Oakland A's a successful baseball franchise with limited funds and limited resources by applying common sense and statistical analysis tools. The lessons learned have helped me to do my job better. Additionally, and importantly, Michael Lewis tells the story very well.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|This is the 2nd time I have watched Lost series. I love it. Thanks Amazon Prime for having Instant Videos. I enjoyed Lost season 2. Thanks again  Oh, by the way, I LOVE AMAZON too.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have owned my swivel sweeper for about 3 years now. Yes, 3 years. It just recently started to have some problems holding a charge so I am in the market for either a new battery or a newer sweeper. I'm probably going to get the new sweeper because my handle did break but not because of poor quality but because I dropped it down a flight of stairs. Nothing a little duct tape couldn't fix. I use it a couple times a week to clean debris around the baseboards and under cabinets. My house is much cleaner because this thing is quick and easy to use, so I use it more frequently than having to drag out a vacuum or dust mop. I also know it is not meant o be a vacuum but just a little picker-upper between those big cleanings.  I also want to mention how great it is for doing stairs. This little thing is allot easier to haul around than my dirt devil hand vac with the cord that is so long it wants to trip me. And the only reason I dropped it was because of the cat. Truly a nice machine.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|My grandson had never seen the Trilogy so I rented it on Instant Video on Amazon. This was a great movie. My grandson loved it too.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I love this show and really miss it. thinking about watching the whole series again. i love watching it on Amazon
B0059A149C|5.0|This movie is fantastic ! My grandpa was a ball turret gunner in. B-17s during the war And he really liked this movie because it was very accurate and it pays homage to all those who served our country! What a great movie and great cast.
0316228532|1.0|I'm still trying to read the \\"set up\\" - I get lost in the many characters being introduced & have to go back and try to remember who is who.<br />When I encountered vulgarity, I almost put the book down - but I kept thinking, \\"This is J.K. Rowling, it HAS to be good.\\"<br />I am not so sure about that. I will try to continue reading it because of who Rowling is - but at this point I can't imagine how the death of a city council member can be earthshattering enough to affect so many people.<br />I will continue reading...because I am curious to see how she will pull out of the bogged-down beginning to the story, and hope for some great mystery to unfold - and hopefully less vulgarity. And IF the pace picks up and the story becomes captivating, I will come back and change my rating of the book.<br />Donna
B0084670FU|5.0|I had no great expectations about the movie. In fact I was not sure I would watch the whole movie. I liked it so much that if there had been a sequel availablie I would have watched it the next night.
0062082353|5.0|I am by no means a book reader. The last book I read cover to cover was in 1995. I saw the story on him and got to read a little bit of the book before purchase, I felt compelled to get it. When it arrived I opened it and put it on the shelf, picked it up the next day and did not stop until I had finished it. I saw that he was killed state side after all the mess he had been through. Wanted to give some support to his family and thought this was a good way to show it.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|If you are a fan of South Park, you will likely find this movie enjoyable.  It was developed by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of South Park.<br /><br />Not for the easily offended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is better than the original; if you enjoyed Temple Run you will definitely enjoy the sequel. With a new train cart section and zip lines it is definitely less repetitious.
B0081336FO|5.0|Absolutely riveting, Moriarty brings heightened suspense. Hounds of Bakersville made me jump twice in one show, only other times were Psycho, Wait until Dark, and Jaws, pretty darn good company.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is without question worth experiencing. It is a beautiful work of art and has some of the most memorable moments I have ever had in a game. All in a slick two to three hour experience.<br />While the short playing time may seem like it is not worth it, the game is rewarding enough to replay multiple times just to experience the beauty and relive it. In some ways the less is more is to its benefits. For adults playing a game for a few hours is more likely in our busy lives, and all the better if they have the evocative feel of journey.<br /><br />Much has been written about the game, but it, like Ico, set a new standard for art in gaming. Hopefully, one that other development houses strive fore. It is a time for more meaningful gaming experiences.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The story lines are incredible, the acting superb, the villains unique. Wish it was closed captioned, though. While I'm English, it is beyond me sometimes!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its ok,but I think that it could use some better directions on why your horse is upset or not fit to be in a race. I fed my horse 5 times and gave it 6 treats but it still wouldn't let me compete. I do have to say that the graphics are pretty good for a kindle fire &lt;3 peace out peeps!
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to have the digital download before I received the cd in the mail. Very satisfied customer!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Mt grandkids have watched this over and over. I have to say I have enjoyed it myself. Come on..Johnny Depp!!
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Had to use hints alot to find out what to do. Disappointed it was a $4.99 game - $2.99 would be a more accurate cost. Giving it a 3 as I skipped sub-games because I couldnt figure them out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game ever. I love that you get to pretend that the horse is a real horse. the only problem is that you don't get coins very easy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My kids absolutely loved this book. Like usual the book is better. My little 10 yr. old reader threw a fit when she finished it because we don't have the next book for her to continue on with the story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Okay, so I was never a fan of temple run anyway, but I went ahead and got this one and it is awesome on my kindle fire! I love the objectives and the new obstacles, along with the fact that I can collect gems and coins and I dont have to pay real money. so awesome.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was good book!!! I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. I may read more books by her.
B00ADYYY50|3.0|Decent album could be better if every other song wasnt the same. The tunes behind the lyrics saved this from 2 stars
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really enjoy the puzzles, just wish they had more free ones since I can put them together pretty quickly I don't want to spend the money on them.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|This series appeals to an Anglophile and history buff.  Not perfectly accurate to the history, but pretty close.  Gorgeous settings, good casting, good acting, especially Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey and Nick Dunning as Thomas Boleyn.  Johnathan Rhys Myers is doing very well as the young Henry; I'll be interested to see how he ages.  Queen Catherine of Aragon is a more sympathetic figure than I'd imagined.  I've only watched a couple of episodes, but look forward to rest.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|the black box. always a great read from michael, however this latest one was a bit ho hum in places but ended on a high note . would still read this author again..
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a little confusing at first with all the different characters.....but once you figured them out, it was great.  Always a new unexpected twist.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is an amazing book that keeps you captured from the moment you start. I personally love Rick Riordan's books and this is one of the ones that I retread every now and again. I have read it 8 times and plan on reading it through several more times. BEST BOOK EVER!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|fun and entertaining.  I would suggest this to anyone.  interesting and keeps your attention.  Good for all ages and sizes.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A friend recommended this book and I am glad he did.  While fiction, I assume there is a lot of grounded history in this book.<br />Seeing the different issues facing many different countries in the early Nineteen hundreds is amazing.  Sometimes mirrors todays world (different issues but same hatred) a little too much.<br />I immediately ordered the second book in the trilogy Winter of the World.  Highly recommend for history buffs.
B000TXG3YA|4.0|Wow I am glad amazon recommended this to me based off my current musical likes (eg Mastodon)<br /><br />These guys are amazing and this is just their first album. I've heard some negative reviews about their third album but from what I have sampled I am looking forward to that as well.<br /><br />The Music: These guys love long songs with intricate intros. Their music melds prog rock with sludge metal with basic hard rock. Sometimes it sounds very experimental, which is something I like.
B007IK44CK|3.0|It is as action packed as the previous films, just not very interesting. Likely made for the teenage boy market.
B008220BLG|5.0|I was pretty skeptical when I heard about Warm Bodies, a story of a zombie falling in love with a human (YES, falling in love). Besides, this movie comes from the studio that released the whole Twilight Saga, but the trailer was so promising I decided to take a risk, and I'm glad I did. This unconventional (but refreshing) story delivers everything that a romance movie should have: funny moments, drama, twists and Nicholas and Teresa's chemistry is undeniable. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing and now I want to get the book!<br />Get the movie if you're a zombie a fan, give it a chance before thinking wrong ideas, you will love it!
0553801473|5.0|Very Surprised not more of the characters from the series were in this book but that leaves room for the next one! LOVED IT!!!
B000SGSU58|5.0|excellent as always michael connelly is at his best with his famous la detective harry borsch  i cant get enough of this character just when you think you figured it out connelly always put his twist on it .  only have a few more of this series to read, print out m connelly list in order of publishing date and check off as you read them.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Found the text a bit clunky but interesting ideas.If free will is illusory as it must be what are the implications for living a meaningful life and how should social values be reassessed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best thing ever. I love this. There is ropes and tunles. Also theres gemes,with that you can buy cool sutff and you can come back to live!
B00A77II0U|4.0|It was just okay game. If it had had actual talking in it would have been better. Do not mind the reading was just looking for more suspense.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show combines character development, historical fiction and story lines with twists and turns. I can't wait to watch season 3!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is mostly about jumping and English riding I personally am a Western rider so I was pretty upset whenever I saw the way this app recreates barrels.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I really loved this book but it does take a while to get into it, with a lot of characters to keep track of.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't have stuck with it if it wasn't written by J.K.Rowling but in the end I'm glad I did.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Traveling across the stars, living life on the edge, battling daleks... I could not have been happier with this purchase. One of my favorite doctors. Now, to finish purchasing my collection. LOVE!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I used to LOVE this game. I played it for hours on end, without ever getting bored. And then, today, it crashed multiple times before I deleted it. I am quite upset, because this was quickly becoming my favorite game. I won't recommend this game to anyone because of it crashing, even though it was so much fun before.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Every character in this show is funny in his/her own right, but the chemistry between the cast members gives this show an extra edge!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Did not like this book at all hated the ending especially. Sorry I spent the money for it don't know what any one would like about it
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Well illustrated, well written and plenty of projects to try. This book is a good value for the $. I bought the E version and wish I had bought the paper version instead. I just find it easier to work with a paper book when it comes to technical things like knots, but that's no fault of the book.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I use this app so I can print from my phone and from my Kindle.  It works very well and I use it all the time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wasn't too sure if I needed/wanted my PRIME subscription, but once i realized that DA was streaming on PRIME I was sold on the service!
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This is the coolest thing ever it helped me maximize my power very smoothly. It helped me select the best brightness settings.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book 2 is every bit as much a page turner as Book 1. Can't wait to start Book 3.  They're still having sex on every other page, but the sub-plot(s) thicken(s).
B0058VW36U|3.0|My friend loves this game so i got it too. it is really fun but gets boring after a while. the little monster is really cute though! i like games that are addicting and this just isn't one of those games
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun and entertaining!! clever game to keep people entertained for a while!! but it is really hard to get the gems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot like temple run but more modern and a lot more fun. The moving trains make it really interesting and it has great graphics. This game is definitely a must have.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows on television.  PBS has done it again.  The acting is superb especially Maggie Smith.<br />Really worth watching
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|I played this game on my kindle fire and it worked fine. I loved it at first but the controls were really sticky, like you would keep running at times and wouldn't jump and instead fall into lava and loose the game! ugh! It is extremely frustrating.  If you get angry easily like I do, beware this app.
B008476HBM|4.0|I am about 75% of the way through this book and can say it is enjoyable, even for a guy.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun, easy.  Like the idea of freeing birds rather than killing pigs. Colors are bright and music pleasing.<br />Good job on design elements.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This was a good movie.  I think this movie is about the climax of the acting skills during the whole series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Liked it as much as, or perhaps more than the first.  Looking forward to completing the series.  A tiny bit slow to start, but still enjoyable beginning to end.
B003HARV4S|5.0|I am glad to have finally purchased this movie.  It is a really interesting film and well worth the wait.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Had me hooked from the first page, wondering where it was going to go, was he a bad guy, was he a good guy wronged. Fabulous!
B004EPZ00C|5.0|I sat to watch this movie begrudgingly, as I was sure it wasn't something I cared for. My husband had selected it and I was obligated to keep him company.  Before long, I was laughing hysterically.  My grandson now knows the movie by heart, and I learned that my college-age niece is a big Rowan Atkinson fan (so I sent her a copy).  I think it's better than the first in the series.  A good lesson in being open-minded.  I would have missed this gem if my husband hadn't forced me to watch it.  Laughter IS the best medicine!!
B007TK77QE|3.0|Having never read a Harry Potter book I had no preconceptions. I described it to my husband as 90% of the book establishing characters who were people we wouldnt want to know, then last 10% exciting but a real sad let down. Too much sad drama for me!
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist provides an enjoyable story riddled with deep, underlying philosophical ideas. The plotline could capture the attention of many young adults, especially when described as a book about a journey to find buried treasure. What that treasure is, however, must be discovered by the reader. It has the adventure, romance, and intrigue that one would wish to find in a good read while opening up the possibility for conversations surrounding fate, perseverance, courage, and life lessons. The text should be made readily available to students for the reasons listed above, but teachers and librarians should be aware of the age group to which they recommend the book. While the novel's writing is simplistic, its ideas are more complex, and ideally, students in grade 8-12 would likely have the maturity necessary to appreciate the novel for what it is. While students in younger grades could potentially enjoy it, they might require some adult guidance in order to understand its deeper messages. Reading it only on the surface level, a student could easily misinterpret the plot as a simple fable, and to allow a student to take the novel at face value would be to deny that student access to a truly moving story.<br /><br />If choosing to use this novel in the classroom, there are various possible ways to incorporate it into a unit or to build a new unit around it. The most obvious way to use this text would be as a basis for teaching/discussing allegory and analyzing the various symbolisms that exists throughout the novel.  Even the title itself is an allegory as Santiago turns into an \\"alchemist\\" of sorts by taking setbacks and turning them into treasurable lessons. The text also opens up a lot of possibility for discussing perseverance and could extend into lessons about other characters or real life people who have persevered through challenges. Furthermore, if wanting to discuss author's perspective, Paulo Coehlo wrote a book titled, The Valkyries, in which he is the main character and in which he references, The Alchemist. The text offers an interesting perspective on The Alchemist, and the two could be read together and then compared. If looking for how the text can help with literary elements, its use of setting and imagery could easily lend to some quick mini-lessons.<br /><br />Teaching this text, or merely having it available to students, has various benefits, one of which is the novel's accessibility. It is written in simple prose and would therefore be a useful text to give to struggling readers who may need practice with decoding or with building fluency. The fact that it is a relatively short text also makes it a good recommendation for reluctant readers who may be intimidated by lengthy books. As a whole class novel, it is beneficial in terms of the conversations it can evoke both relating to literary terms and the profound lessons of the text. Its only potential drawback is that students may need a solid amount of teacher support in order to interpret the text in a way that allows them to draw meaning from it. If recommending the book as an independent read, a teacher may want to consider the student's maturity level and whether or not they will be able to easily access the book's underlying themes. Overall, though, the novel is a pleasant read that has the potential to shift a reader's perspective on life and to convey to them some important messages worth learning.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|The cast of McLintock was very enjoyable and being a big fan of the Duke makes it that much better.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Some pretty outrageous stunt scenes where you have to push the &#34;I believe button&#34; but it was on par with the last few MI movies for entertainment value.  The new BMW  i8 hybrid was the star of the show.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I just love El Dorado with the &#34;Duke&#34;, Robert Mitchum and James Cann. This cast is much better than the cast of Rio Bravo. The cast of Rio Bravo didn't have the same chemistry as in El Dorado.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have always read a particular type of author; but through your book suggestions; I have explored different venue publications of different authors.  The result is fantastic.  Please keep sending me your recomendations.
034580404X|5.0|Amazing book I'm not a reader but this was recommended to me..... And we'll needless to say I couldn't put it down!! Highly recommended :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have always read a particular type of author; but through your book suggestions; I have explored different venue publications of different authors.  The result is fantastic.  Please keep sending me your recomendations.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|'Twas great until I ran out of money for neededs.The game is good in its simplicity, makes you always want to be the victor, which is why the need to buy extra 'tools' for the advanced levels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't wait to read book two.  I really enjoyed the love story between the two lead characters.  Christian was too good to be true!
B005HJU7HA|3.0|The nature of the writing was dated, dated to an era where I did not enjoy as I would've a century ago.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Book One of the Fifty Shades of Grey was a great book.  I usually don't read this kind of books but I couldn't put it down.
B004ZQRJFO|3.0|Eminem mad another sloppy album with too much back ground noise with other ft. artist singing along. Save the money and just buy the song you like.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite of the three books.  I really liked the love story and the way that it ended.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|This album is well worth the money; it is amazing workout/driving mix also. If you want to get the party started play this album.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|You just can't beat Bruder for quality.<br />If you have a truck lover this is sure to<br />Please for years!
B005SODYGA|3.0|8. Not the best all out album from this band. Has a few great song after that is more of a collector’s item.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Over the course of a month or two, I've watched every episode. The show, I would give 4.5 stars, but the fact that there doesn't seem to be a &#34;subtitle&#34; option was where I chose to knock it into &#34;4&#34; territory, rather than &#34;5.&#34;
B000SVZIR6|5.0|I consider this better than the Broadway show or the Yul Branner movie.  Chow Yun Fat is convincing as the King, and Jodie Foster is as willful as she gets.
B00AOB5I1Q|4.0|We love this movie, as it is geared towards kids from 9 to 12 years old.  It is a fun movie.  My wife and I saw it years ago and really liked it.  It has some pretty neat special effects.  It is not a big budget film, just a simple, but fun film.  If your kids like aliens and space ships, they will love this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The story is a heartwarming one but the wisdom of the main characters is well beyond what is believable at theiir ages .  Nonetheless one is kept entertained.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|All of my friends raved about Downton Abbey and I was way behind. I started watching it on Amazon Prime and couldn't stop! I was watching them into the wee hours of the morning. I can't explain it, but you get sucked in! If the scenery, costumes and one-liners by Maggie Smith weren't enough, the stellar cast and the plot twists and turns will keep you watching. I highly recommend it, but start watching it early in the day!
157421327X|5.0|Very good beginner book on zentangle. The basic ideas are good and illustrations are easy to follow. Great. Great. Great.
B007HACDLK|5.0|i really enjoy all of vince flynns books & this one is no exception; very fast, enjoyable read that i recommend to anyone who likes these types of stories
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The only negative thing about this series is it had to end.  This story sucked me in and I couldn't put it down. Now at least I can catch up on the sleep I missed reading these books!
B0090XLDKY|5.0|great movie, good quality, and wonderful as ever. if you've never seen it and like good musicals, get it! if you have seen it, then know that it's well worth the buy.
B008YMHORI|4.0|Loved the collaboration of piano and cello by these two artists.  I listened to it again on a snowy day and found new pieces to appreciate, and one rather innovative work which I I have come to appreciate a little more each time I hear it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love this game and would recommend it to any who has or loves horses. very fun and easy to understand. wish you could earn money and gems quicker thou
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Like its predecessor TV series, this latest movie installment of Mission: Impossible is very action-packed with a quite good storyline.  Acting and actors are good.
0345803507|5.0|I was so glad this couple ended up with a family. Even though Ana wasn't into the rough kinky sex that Christin was into, she wanted to experiment with that type of lifestyle just to make her man happy.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The mark of J.J. Abrams, the producer of this series and also of Lost, is quite evident.  The individual episodes have unique, very entertaining storylines that makes us eager to watch the next episode.  While not science-fiction, the series certainly has the enticing aspects that Lost had.<br /><br />Acting and actors are quite good and convincing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun. Even my 3yr old son knows how to play. Fun game!<br />Would recommended it to others
B00821OX98|1.0|The description of the series is inviting, but when we actually watched the first couple of episodes, we were disappointed in both the acting and the storyline.  We made it almost half way through the second episode before we gave up on any chance that the series would improve.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Hours of fun. All classes are well worth developing. Easy enough to advance and you don't even have to spend real money to do well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just finished reading Safe haven , it was fantastic.  When or if you read it make sure you have a box of Kleenex it's a tear jurker.  It's a page turner you won't be able to put it down.  Read it
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I have been captivated since the first page. So much death and loss but never a disappointment from the character loss. Queen Cersi`s demise was the real big shock that had me in awe!!! Great read!! On to the next book. Sad that I'm on the last book already.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun keeping yourself entertained while dealing with the daily humdrum of riding a bus to work. It is a good deal.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the perfect accessory for my kindle. it always is ready when ever I can't find one or one needs batteries.also, there are no ads
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is a very creative story. it is definatley going to be a movie at some point. i would stongly reccomend
B00AKYRCNY|3.0|I gave this app three stars.  It was not a bad app but wasn't really what I was looking for.<br />I got it for my two year old grandson to play. It was not quite what I needed. He had trouble<br />Dragging the pieces and getting them to fit.<br />I think it might be ok when he is older.
0765348780|3.0|I just finished the 10 books in the series.<br /><br />There were times when I wasn't sure if I would continue.  I'd put it down for a month or so at a time before picking it up again.  To be honest, the only reason I finished it is because I already had a lot of time invested in it.<br /><br />This is a difficult one to review actually.  I think Erikson is actually very good writer.  When looked at on smaller, individual parts or entire books.  However when looked at as the series overall, he seems very scattered and poor at being able to bring forth the aspects with important relevance.  And, vice-versa, to just eliminate the stuff with little or no relevance or at least put them into a much smaller role.<br /><br />If this series was edited down to 5 books, stripping away everything that was useless, it would have been great.  However there is just so, so, so much that has no reason to be there.  It really seems that some books and their individual storylines exist simply so that the series could end up being 10 books long.<br /><br />Storylines and characters often have a lot of focus, only to never be heard from again.  Campaigns run which seem to be distractions with little reasoning behind them, only to bring characters basically back to where they started with little resolve.<br /><br />I'm not even saying that an epic series shouldn't have such distractions.  The time invested in these distractions though is just too grand in this case in the overall scope of the series.  Seriously, entire books are completely irrelevant in the overall picture.  Maybe if the reasoning behind them was better flushed out it would have been more enticing and tolerable, and even enjoyable to follow these scenarios.  That's not the case though.  It just feels so scattered.  Unnecessarily.  Amateurishly (is that a word?).<br /><br />I almost feel bad for this series.  There is lots of potential for it to have been great.  If it had been written until completion and then edited asa whole, I'm sure the outcome would have been much more succinct and better for it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this series.  I've read far too many epic series in this genre which are much, much better.  However, if, like me, you've already read so much of what's out there and just want to pick up a series that has a bit of a different spin, sure, read this.  There's entertainment value in it.  It's better than the worst and worse than the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love The Hunger Games. It's my favorite movie and book. My friend challenged me to read 3 other books before reading the 2nd book of the trilogy. I only have 2 more to go
B004SRNH10|2.0|I downloaded this app because 3 game apps I downloaded, one of which I paid for, needed Adobe Air and I didn’t know they needed Adobe Air until after I had downloaded them and days later attempted to play them.<br /><br />Since installing Adobe Air, I have noticed that my Android tablet will just shut off on its own and will not come back on, like the battery is drained but the battery was fine when the tablet shut off.  I would then have to plug in the charger for a few seconds to reset the tablet so I can turn it back on.<br /><br />I suspect Adobe Air is responsible for one of my inventory files disappearing on one occasion.  I had the file open, made a few changes to it, and then minimized it in case I needed to return to it later.  I decided to pass time by playing a game, the game I decided to play REQUIRES Adobe Air.  About 30 minutes later I returned to my file and it had literally disappeared!!  It was gone like it never existed!!<br /><br />As I thought more about this, I realized that every time the tablet turned itself off and that one time when my file disappeared I had been playing a game that REQUIRES Adobe Air to be installed.<br /><br />Since the problem only happens AFTER playing a game that requires Adobe Air, I think in my case I should only play these games when I don’t have another application open.  I usually leave my tablet on standby but after I am done playing the games that need Adobe Air  I think I will turn my tablet off then turn it back on when I am ready to use it again later.  This way the tablet is properly rebooted  instead of being crashed into a reboot.<br /><br />If it wasnt for the game I paid for I would consider uninstalling it.
B00139XTG4|4.0|The Black Swan is a discussion of what we never plan on. They occur more often than we care to admit. Or know it all educators will discount their existence.<br />A must read for everyone who has designed or developed a product.  The parallel liability issues of the cases discussed in this book are to be taken serious.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games books on my Kindle. They were interesting and imaginative. I ended up reading all three over a weekend.
0525953728|5.0|This book is not high brow literary prose.  It will not leave you reaching for the dictionary, looking up some word you've never read before.  It is not a philosophical examination of life as we know it with thousands of words dedicated to a moral examination of the subject.  Rather, it is conversational, matter of fact even.  And therein is its power.<br /><br />The reality is the everyday inner workings of a job never live up to the hype.  Like a championship NFL football team, we see the 3 hours every Sunday, but not the countless hours of practice and sacrifice that the players endure to be the elite.  Mark Owen and his fellow teammates are arguably the best in the world at what they do.  However, instead of throwing footballs, they're removing bad guys from the world so no more good guys get hurt.  Say what you want about the morality of it all, but warriors are a necessary evil in society.  And if you're not ready to praise them for their sacrifice, it's best to not say anything at all.<br /><br />This book was an incredibly easy read and, like many reviewers before me, I finished it quickly.  Owen's style is conversational and that makes it move smoothly.  There are many places where the reader, if not part of the military, would be confused by some of the acronyms and lingo; Owen predicts this and does a good job of explaining these \\"military-isms\\" so the reader doesn't have to pause and leap for Google.<br /><br />I'd seen, at least twice, the 60 Minutes interview with Owen and had read or watched a number of documentaries on the raid.  I felt comfortable that I had a pretty good idea what happened.  What I was looking for was the back story leading up to the raid and an insider's personal view of Special Ops.  I got what I'd hoped for.  Almost half the book is dedicated to Owen's childhood, extensive training and previous missions.  This information is, in my opinion, vital to understanding why Owen came to be one of 4 team leaders on the Bin Laden raid.The amount of training, preparedness and attention to detail that these men have for their jobs is nothing short of astounding, even down to tucking shoelaces into a boot prior to the raid (probably to cut down on noise and/or getting snagged on anything).<br /><br />Like professional athletes, these men sacrifice everything to be the best at what they do.  They are always on high alert, always seem to be training or on a deployment, and are never home.  Friends and family might know what their job is, but can only guess at what they do.  Like his teammates, Owen pays a price for his desire to be the best and hints at it in this book.  But, like any humble professional, he never dwells on it nor asks for our pity.  Nor does he brag or ask to be put on a pedestal.  Like most humble professional, he's just doing his job.<br /><br />Owen doesn't spend a lot of time on his contempt for those in authority, but he does touch on it.  I didn't find this out of character nor particularly anti patriotic.  As we become senior in our jobs, we are more aware of the hypocrisy of our leadership; those that have never done the job spend a lot of time taking credit for its successes.  Instead of continuing up the chain, Owen decided to retire from the Navy and write this book.  He has taken a lot of heat and is, most likely, ostracized for doing so.  Operators are supposed to stay quiet and go about their business like good little soldiers.  According to Owen, he wanted to make sure the story was told correctly.  Having never had the honor of serving, especially in Special Ops, I can't comment on the right or wrong of his decision, only that I'm glad he did.  Otherwise, I never would have been able to live, at least through his words, the story that was one of the most important ones of my generation.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed reading this book.  It filled in many gaps and gave me a flavor for the sacrifices our men and women in the armed forces endure to protect our country.  To protect me.  Freedom tastes sweeter for those who have risked everything to defend it.  I can only thank Mark Owen, and others like him, from the bottom of my heart for doing so.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the Hunger games books. They kept me in suspense and the story line was interesting. I couldn't put them down.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. A lot of my friends at school are like this is an amazing book you should definitly read. And since I hate conforming to what my friends like (I know reading a book isn't like I'm a conformist, but still it bugs me) it took me forever to get around to reading the book. Soooo, Yeah. It wasn't great it wasn't bad, it irked me. I have never really liked Cassandra Clare, to tell you the truth. I don't know her, but the whole Harry Potter fanfic plagirism thing bothers me. I love Harry Potter and I didn't really read the fanfic, but a while ago I read a review and it mentioned it and I was like huh. Well anyways I digress, but I will come back to this later in my review. So here's the breakdown of the book.<br />THE PREMISE<br />In the pandemodium club where Clary and her friend Simon are, Clary witnesses a murder. Except there is way more to this murder than meets the eye, possibly because Clary is the only one who can see the victim and the attackers. So Simon (who I don't like) and the security guards (who I mildly disliked) thinks she's crazy. Clary then gets into a fight with her mom and meets one of the attackers. His name is Jace. He is a shadow hunter. He is perfectly willing to tell her this, even though it is breaking the rules. Clary, Jace and company meet the bad guy with possibly the worst name in history of the bad guy universe. He is the dreaded Valentine. *Cue evil music*<br />THE PROS<br />1. The characters were mostly good. The usual, interesting back stories, the norm.<br />2. The concept. I liked the whole idea of Shadowhunters.<br />3. The follow through. Clare did have a really good story here, and it definietly held my attention. It just wasn't a one sit read.<br />THE CONS<br />1. Back to Valentine. Really the name come on there aren't any better names for the villian. How about lollipop or gumdrop. It would be an improvement.<br />2. The ending. Really.... It just seems obvious that it isn't true. I don't want to give a spoiler, but if you read the book then you know what I'm talking about. It seemed so illogical...<br />3. Simon. I just didn't like that guy. He made me mad with his this and that and when he was talking I was like, ohhhh, page skip!!<br />4. UMMMMMMM, antone else seeing the Harry Potter resemblace?? Like the circle reminds me of death eaters, Luke's a bit like Snape and Lupin. I'm not saying that she like intentionally copying HP, but a few things stood out a bit too much for my taste.<br />5. Jace and Dad. Even without knowing Jace's dad, it was disturbing. And interesting. I suppose.... I mean that relationship is twisted, but I get where Clare was going with the whole thing. Like abusive relationships still have love if the person is deluded into thinking that...<br />OVERALL<br />I don't hate Cassandra Clare's book, BUT I don't like it either. I think I went into this book slightly biased about the plagarism. Now if you've read other reviews you'll know she wrote fanfic about Draco. She used some of that fanfic as part of Jace's story. I guess its her own work so whatever, but still weird.... So yeah, I guess looking back I'm biased, but what can I say I'm an HP fan all the way. I don't want to dislike the book and author, but subconciously I do.<br />WOULD I READ THIS BOOK: YEAH, it's a popular book with a movie coming out, so there's gonna be some hype and reading the book might help to determine if that said hype is well deserved.<br />WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK: NO, I would remain silent on the subject, BUT if someone asked me weather they should read it, I might say yes, but they would have to be direct.<br />WOULD I REREAD THIS BOOK: NO<br />WOULD I BUY THIS BOOK: DEPENDS on the price<br />WILL I READ THE NEXT BOOK: YEAH, I hate leaving a series unfinished.<br />WILL I WATCH THE MOVIE: PROBABLY NOT, its not really my parents or my brothers thing and I DO NOT want to go with my fangirl friends and definitly not alone...<br />AM I HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK: NO, it's okay, but not making my top reads shelf.<br /><br />*EDIT* Just wanted to add one more thing. Everyone is talking about how awesome Jace is and how much they love him. Am I like the only person who thinks he's kind of creepy? Like I dunno, but I get a bad feeling about him.ly not alone...<br />AM I HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK: NO, it's okay, but not making my top reads shelf.<br /><br />*EDIT* Just wanted to add one more thing.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautifully cast and filmed!  Don't miss it!  I'm trying to find season three now as I've missed the first 3 getting caught up.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My son loves these Diary of Wimpy kid series.  He reads the book in one day.  I bought all of them for him so far.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show. Belong to Amazon Prime and watch for free. Very good investment and well worth the annual fee. Check it out.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love to buy from Ebay so this def a app to download.  It makes it easier to purchase and keep track.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved the constant action. I was in suspense with every page I turned! ****SPOILER**** I'm a little disappointed that there won't be a love story between Jace & Clary. Simon seems like more of a brother versus a boyfriend. Maybe another dashing boy will come along in the next book & sweep Clary off her feet! :)
1450419895|5.0|Absolutely amazing book.  Great for any person who is just beginning their new fitness routine or someone who has been working out for a while but wants to focus on a few underdeveloped muscles.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|Make no mistake about it - the intended audience for this film is the younger teenaged crowd - though with themes that glorified promiscuity and betraying your parents for a boyfriend, I'm not entirely sure how well suited it would be for most adolescents. That aside, there were occasions when 'Red Riding Hood' did attempt to rise above the teen romance (or rather, lust) genre. Coming from someone who was both on the fence about watching it and unimpressed with the opening, I have to admit there were many redeeming qualities within. This was not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, and yet, it was not nearly so bad as some reviews here have suggested.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />- Both male leads. I refer to them as Donnie Brasco and Elvis.<br /><br />- The dialogue was sometimes fair, occasionally good, but usually corny. In one scene, Donnie Brasco steps up and says \\"We can't give her to the wolf. That's human sacrifice.\\" Yes, thank you, Captian Obvious. But I really don't think 17th century villagers being picked off by a werewolf with a grudge did much stepping onto the 21st century politically correct soapbox. Instances such as that, and the classic referral to the other villagers \\"judging\\" her, made me feel like I was in high school again.<br /><br />- The stupidities, such as running water flowing from a well in the dead of winter, and pretty boys/girls flouncing about with naked arms and collars open halfway to their naval in the same weather.<br /><br />- The overall theme. While the ending was satisfying, it was also redundant. (!!!Minor Spoilers Ahoy!!!) Valerie kills one werewolf only to hook up with another. And who that first werewolf was makes me lament for the priorities of your average teenager.<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />- The mystery element, which was not overly obvious and did keep the viewer suspicious of everyone and constantly doubting their own conclusions.<br /><br />- Very well paced. The storyline flowed, and every scene was important to the plot.<br /><br />- It wasn't a traditional horror movie, but the stunning visuals, which were mostly not comprised of computer imagery, only contributed to the creepy atmosphere. It was eerie, and something of a light thriller/mystery with werewolf lore thrown in.<br /><br />- The werewolf. After watching practically every werewolf movie under the sun, and ALWAYS being disappointed, this, in all honesty, was the lycanthrope I have been waiting all these years to see. I don't want to spoil it by giving too much away, but it was wolflike without too closely resembling a normal wolf, though not overdone with the CGI. It was actually frightening for its believability factor.<br /><br />So, if you're like me and are constantly on the prowl for a good late night werewolf flick to sink your teeth into (apologies for the puns), this is certainly not great cinema, but was very entertaining and definitely worth a watch.was important to the plot.<br /><br />- It wasn't a traditional horror movie, but the stunning visuals, which were mostly not comprised of computer imagery, only contributed to the creepy atmosphere.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|It was Woo much fun wheni could play it. then it wouldn't let me play it. can you please tell me what's keeping it?
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1981. This album is a masterpiece. Not that most of the others aren't, but you'd think they'd have run out of steam by now. :-)
B0084670FU|5.0|Very nice movie! Acting and suspense were very well done...Will keep you engaged and interested during the entire movie...worth your time
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|The show premiered all at once and awed me enough to get me to watch the entire season with very little breaks between episodes. I highly recommend this and will purchase it on Blu-ray, despite being able to watch it on Netflix. The cast is fantastic, with Kevin Spacey nailing his role as the smart and evil Francis Underwood, the series is also well written and has enough twists to shock you.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Sad and depressing this small West England town has nothing to redeem it.  I was sad to read this hopeless tale of families so dysfunctional they make The Manson Family look good.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|@namesping.  New to it but learning.  I would have never used it but entered a contest on The Ellen show with it and won so guess what. I use Twitter now.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Product is what was expected. I was very satisfied with this transaction. The product arrived quickly and in good shape.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome!  I was so delighted to be able to catch up on the episodes I had missed before the show returns to TV with live episodes.
B002KGEORM|2.0|There is just too much drama, side deals, back deals, back stabbings, secrets being kept and plot twists upon plot twists.  The writers must feel that if they don't have at least a dozen plot twists for every episode then they haven't done their job.  The show is very frustrating to follow.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Quick & easy read. Geared towards pre-teen to adult. Explains things more in detail than the 1st book. The speed is faster as well. I read #1 and thought it lacked a lot. Didn't read #2 for several months because of that. Once I finally did, I really enjoyed it, and I had to read #3.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My wife and kids love it! Easy to start and lots of fun!<br /><br />Not time consuming and great for kids.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|I am really annoyed I bought all these books, I was intrigued with the first book and the story however as I read on the author just annoyed me with her repetitive language. &#34; delicious&#34; anyone??? How many times did she use that ONE word to describe everything!!! I found myself skipping over all the sex scenes because they were just plain boring. All she had to do was look at him, or roll her eyes, or bite her f******* lip and he was all over her, no matter where they were. I am really pissed that E.L James has become a millionaire with this trash, when there are a million better erotic books out there from people who can actually write. Want my money back!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This series was so well done. I love period pieces and The Tudors did not let me down.<br />That time period in England is just so interesting and exciting and crazy.<br />I have watched all 4 seasons twice and now I just go back and watch some of my favorites.<br />If you like period pieces, you will like this.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|love this game but, I can only play it 2 or 3 times then it won't load. so I delete and then re-install play 2 or 3 more times ect, ect, ect. get this B.S. fixed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is an awesome game.you should defeinetly get this game. my mom steals this tame away from me. love it.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Love this movie.  It is so romantic; every women would like to have a man so gentle and sweet as Leopold (love Hugh Jackman)!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This used 2 be the best game but since they download the so called &quot;New&quot; version it's a total Rip Off!!!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this app very much.  All the variety of animals keeps the game exciting.  I would recommend this app.
0307474259|5.0|This book and the science explained within, covers what the dieticians, nutritionists and the food pyramid don't.  It explains why some people struggle with keeping weight off and what they must do to achieve and maintain results.  It truly explains why some people get fat, and why some people don't.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie, the cast is just fabulous.  And the plot is a great twist on the classic love story.  I buy it for everyone I know.  Just a joy to watch.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Well at least like this. I listen to it all. If it's good it's for me. Mumford and Sons truly now how to capture the art of songwriting and keep a folk but current vibe. This band and album are a great listen!
B005SZAEYO|5.0|american horror story kept me on the edge in every episode. all the characters were extremely intriguing and i love that all of them had shades of grey in them. jessica lange and zach quinto stole the show for me
B0018GRAE4|5.0|I love it all. These guys nailed it! The melodies are great, and brutal where they should be. The vocal styling is reminisecent to me of early PTW meeting Soilwork. I really enjoy this album!
B005721W9O|4.0|Great play on the &#34;Star Trek&#34; fan convention scene. Not real deep but incredibly  funny. Who thinks up these things?
B001MDXOBQ|5.0|LOG is by far one of the best out there today. The caliber of musicianship and out of control redneck partying is awesome. These guys are truly in a category of their own. Throughout the years the have only gotten better but this holds a special place for me, helping me realize the metal is truly being carried on by gentlemen like this gives me hope for our musical futures.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!  Super fun, its great for horse lover's and those who cant have horses. I definately reccomend
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|Has an &#34;old school&#34; classic rock style sound. Liked it from the begining song until the end of the CD.
B0059A149C|5.0|enjoyed it very much<br />Highly recommended to everyone,  people should get their kids to watch it to understand their countrys commitment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a good read~nothing short of what you expect from Nicholas Sparks. Couldn't put it down, then realized I was almost done.
B00571F26Y|1.0|This is the first - and last - ebook that I will buy WHICH HAS RECIPES. You cannot print out the recipes to take into the kitchen. I don't like my computer to sit on the kitchen counter to get flour all over it while I'm following a recipe.<br /><br />The book is a very good book except for lack of a print capability, but I am very annoyed because the recipes are useless to me.
0679805273|5.0|Excellent reading for all ages.  I have purchased it for a graduating high school senior and, now, for a retiring senior citizen! Both loved it.  I recommend it for anyone beginning a new phase of life.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|This game is fun to play and brings back memories when I used to play Pole Position.  The games grafics are very similar.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Having a glimpse of an early to mid 1900s Brittish family has truly been a treat. There is something so compelling about the characters, you never want to stop watching! This is truly a classic!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Writers for this show are top notch. The characters are believable and not plastic.<br />Some of the stories are cliffhangers and keep you wanting to immediately watch the next one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This does what it is supposed to do. I don't see the quality being any better than anyone else's, but I lets you play.
0679805273|5.0|I received this book years ago when I graduated from college.  I recently purchased it as a Christmas gift for my son who will graduate from college this year.  I love this book as much as I did when I received my copy many years ago.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The new update did not save my world. It changed survival mode to creative mode so I lost all my diamond I had.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I think that more of the story and less of the bedroom would enhance the story.  The actual story has merit.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I feel like I am playing Mario again.  Very cute game. GREAT GRAPHICS as well.  My kids love it, my 5 year old plays it all the time.
0307010856|5.0|The illustrations in this book are straight out the 70's in the best way possible!  The story is funny and good for kids 2 - 3 especially if they are afraid of monsters.
0765325950|3.0|Pretty boring battles followed by more battles. The first book was so much better than the last. The characters seemed lost in a continuation of plots from the previous book. No real twists not much gripping reading. Just too much going on and way too many trollocs. The ending was not great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|In the second book of the Hunger Games series, the suspense does not let up. You're almost forced to read the book straight through, it's just that good. Can't wait to read the last one!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 4&amp;6yo enjoy this game and I enjoy watching them play it!<br />It gives them a chance to get good eye and hand coordination
B005HSL626|5.0|I thought this would be a silly game and I would be getting rid of it...it is the best non-thinking game. If you just want to waste time this is the game...lots of fun and keeps you returning to it.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|It was easy to forget that this film was subtitled... it's a great film.  Gorgeously acted, filmed and thought out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great new story, please keep them coming. I will stay the course to the end. Begin with the first book and keep going.
B000QY9WOU|4.0|Unbelievable how good you can keep a human body looking despite her age.<br />She is the ultimate entertainer and what a looker.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|In order to get the alarm you must upgrade for $1.99. False advertising! That's why I am giving one star.
B009MO5G90|3.0|The resident evil film series is cool. The concept and special effects are just awesome, and it remains so in Resident Evil: Retribution. Unfortunately, it lacks any semblance of a good and logical story. The entire movie wasn't even relevant to the series. They create a new goal and introduced a new conflict at the start to prevent that goal and thereby spend the entire movie trying to resolve that conflict to achieve that goal. They get her captured so they can spend an entire film getting her out. Lets face it, it could of been twenty minutes of a film then gone to a serious issue. What is the real issue? Actually saving the human race. Yeah, I know, hasn't that always been the goal? Well, this time its for real. Now, its no mind bender but is at least worth one watch because, like I said, Resident Evil is an awesome series, and this movie's short comings isn't enough to completely destroy it. After-all, they never were very good with the writing and if you've stuck around this long, why stop.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought this based on the reviews, and I couldn't have enjoyed reading it anymore than I did. If you're looking for an entertaining read at a very good price, purchase this, you won't regret it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great show! Good if you are a fan of Sherlock, not like those versions where they change everything except the names.
1449410243|5.0|Everyone got the biggest kick out of this book at Christmas. This book got quite a laugh. Our son just got 2 kittens.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|Even if you don't like the Star Trek original series (TOS), you'll probably like these movies (as is the case for me). Star Trek VI is the last of the TOS series of movies before moving to TNG.<br /><br />This one is excellent overall. Good plot, characters, and believable.
1419705849|5.0|Our Grandchildren love to read books, this is perfect for them. A very cute practical story. I hope they will learn from the story.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game.  My only complaint is itmakes you go back and forth to different locations.  I dont mind doing it but it would be better if you could jump from location to location with the map.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|I really liked this telling of the old story. Johny Depp was great as always and I don't remember when I saw him suck in any role. As long as you can forgive 21 Jump Street, gag. The Alice character is great and the women who played her was great.
