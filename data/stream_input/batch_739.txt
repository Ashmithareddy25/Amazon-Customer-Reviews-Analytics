B000EDWL82|4.0|The Editors are a blend of The Psycadelic Furs, The Doors, Joy Division, U2, and Johnny Marr's early guitar work.    Tracks like 'Lights', 'Fall', and 'Munich' are sheer class!    'Blood' is my favorite track, and sounds like it could have been on some dark John Hughes flick.    Definitely worth checking out!
B00005221M|3.0|I cannot think of a film where I didn't enjoy the Director's Cut more than the theatrical release of a film.  This one is a strong exception.  A few of the scenes that were expanded were nice to watch, but none were essential. With one exception:  Russell Means' long lecture at the end about the fate of the American Indian.  His character was a man of few words, yet here he is giving a speech that sounds more like one he would have given as president of AIM.  (and by the way, the work he has done outside of film is worthy of respect, and it has earned mine, so it wasn't the content of what he said that bothered me--it was that it was out of place and out of character and destroyed the flow of the film at the end).  It is what was cut that was troubling. Some scenes (graveyard) are incomprehensible now, and some of the best lines (and of course that \\"song\\" as they are searching for the women) were omitted, and it isn't clear why.  Overall, the original release tells a more coherent story.  We have learned why Michael Mann isn't an editor.  Great film on VHS.
B000I2MRHE|1.0|We had hoped this would make tummy time a happy time, instead it seemed to make her so mad and uncomfortable, I just put it back in the box after 3 tries even adding padding for her stomach.  I do not recommend this for any baby, not if they have the same reaction like my granddaughter.
B000001F29|5.0|I had never heard of that album before somebody made me listen to the vynil version of this one. And it is really awesome! It's really a classic of his genre; the title track is really incredible. I recommend it to every Yes and Vangelis fans of course, but to old progressive rock fans too.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my father for Christmas. He was so excited, we had to watch it on Christmas morning. It was a big hit with him!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This is a masterful work of Yo-Yo-Ma that can best be described as evoking the sublime.  Its richness and depth lead us to a place neither earthly nor spiritual, but to a place where all is united in the purest of harmony. It achieves what no words can express, and by doing so brings us to a state that is fully experiential.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|This was a great documentary on one of the greatest rock bands ever..Get this along with The Kids are Alright...has a lot of great old school footage including some rare \\"high numbers\\" clips
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Someone said in one of the reviews here that Norah Jones is twenty-five going on fifty. I am supposing that has to do with her musical style.  So that puts her in a grouping with James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Van Morrison, Bonnie Raitt, Carly Simon, and Carol King.  Hmmm, I wonder what is wrong with being in that grouping.  Her father influenced the Beatles. So, when an album as good as Not Too Late comes out and people basically call the music &#34;old&#34; by comparing it to the people above, I say &#34;kudos&#34;.  This album is melodic and beautiful from top to bottom.  Every single song is hummable.  It has a certain pace, as do many of James Taylor's albums, with a little Cassandra Wilson thrown in on the side.  It also has no bad songs.  And there is depth to all the songs as well.  So Norah Jones is a twenty-five going on fifty year old prodigy.  I say Yippee Ki Yay to the most listenable album this year.  There is a reason that it is the number one consumer album on Amazon by their rating.  Give it a listen and after about the hundredth listen you might, and that is an iffy might, want to listen to something else.  Oh, and if you want to hear her lighter side, get The Little Willies.  She is who she is and her music reflects that.  And thank you very much Norah, for being the best you you can be.
0937381888|5.0|Palmer's book is the best \\"how to brew\\" book on the market for the following reasons.  1).  The format enables a beginner to start brewing very quickly; 2).  The depth of the book is outstanding.  Consequently, as the brewer becomes more experienced, he/she will be able to turn to this book as a reference again and again;  3). The book does much more than tell the reader \\"how to do it.\\"  It tells the reader \\"why.\\"  With this book, the beginning or intermediate brewer will have solid understanding of the science behind brewing.  This is essential because one cannot make great beer without knowing the science behind it.  4). Despite teaching some science, this book is not over anyone's head and you don't need to be a scientist or professional brewmaster to gain from this book.  Anyone who is interested in the hobby of homebrewing can learn the science of beermaking from this book.  Because of this book, I was able to immediately get into all-grain brewing and other fairly advanced stuff.  I would not have attempted this, without this book.  I've since looked at other books and I have not found anything that is as good as this one.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I love the old movies, definitely the great ones. This is an excellent job of creating a new movie with stuff that I'd love to see in an old one. Thank you Kerry Conran, et al.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|It was really smart to make the Blade Runner movie in such a nice presentation as they did, because the people that are the early adoptors of HD movies are the people that made Blade Runner what it is today.  A cult hit.<br /><br />With that said, the box is is fantastic and worth every penny.  You can read what is in the box, but have to say it was my favorite christmas gift this year.<br /><br />The HD DVD Blade Runner is the best I've ever seen.  The sound is fantastic, the picture is fantastic, and the fact you get every version is just awesome.  I recommend the 5 disc set to everyone!
B00005JNS0|3.0|The film itself is great. My son was a little frightend at the beginning because the motor noise was so loud. This actual \\"being there\\" grandstand sound only works when you've been there. We have'nt. The story is good, the graphics are great. A girl race driver could have made the film appeal to more girls. Would still recommend the film to others.
B00005JPKE|1.0|Did not realize that it was all subtitles.  Very difficult for elderly to keep up with the conversations.  He lost interest in just a few minutes and wouldn't watch the remaining movie.

6305127646|5.0|Val Kilmer does an awesome job as a super Thief that has lots of looks and tricks up his sleave.  Hired by a corrupt Russian businessman to steal a formula to Cold Fussion for a British scientest whom he not only makes a connection with but eventually falls in love with.  The originally play a little cat and mouse and join sides to fight the corrupt Russian.  In the end he gives it up for her love.<br /><br />A really good and clean movie that will pull you into the story.  One for the library.
B000RW3VD4|5.0|(Note to those who complain about Amazon's price: YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT. Go elsewhere, then.)    This is one of those rare movies I could watch over and over again, and/or rewind a scene to watch it a couple of times more. That especially applies to the montage of frenzied traders, where Stone makes a brief cameo. There are many visual subtleties, from camera perspectives to item inclusion, that a less talented filmmaker would happen on only by luck. It's a shame the theatrical version cut out the extras on the 20th anniversary DVD; not a frame was wasted. Well, I take that back: the obligatory bed scene with Bud and Darien. I don't say that because I'm a prude, but because it didn't add anything to the story.    It's nothing new to say that Michael Douglas gave the performance of a lifetime -- perhaps anyone's lifetime. Martin and Charlie Sheen, the latter noticeably less muscled than later years, also gave strong performances that were Oscar-worthy. Also of note is Hal Holbrook, who I wish had more lines. However, it fits with the story: if his character had had more time with Bud before the latter got in too deep, Bud wouldn't have needed the shocks of the liquidation meeting and his father's heart attack.    Simply a masterpiece of a movie.
B000VR824S|5.0|I myself am not a big big fan of Eric Clapton but my husband is.  I bought this DVD for him and he LOVES it.  He watches it and that doesn't always happen with DVDs I buy for him.  He has even watched it more than once and that NEVER happens.
B000W4KT64|5.0|we saw this movie at theater & teenage girls wanted it for Christmas & were very excited to get it.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|ordering this item was easy enough. I recieved the package a week before it was expected, which was very lovely indeed. it was placed carefully in a box and was in no way damaged when i opened it up. The CD plays perfectly, without a scratch on it.    i would definatly recomened order this product from here.
1416911049|5.0|Uglies is the first book in a trilogy written by Scott Westerfeld. This book was very interesting and kept me turning the pages. I read the entire book in three days. I've never read a book that fast in my life! That says something right there. Tally, the main character, was well developed and entertaining. I really identified with her (as I think many girls and even boys will too) because she wanted to be beautiful like everyone else, she was self conscious of herself just like most teenagers in today's society, especially girls. We're brought up to think that we're all supposed to look like pencil thin movie stars and guys should look like weight lifters but what people don't realize is that imperfections are what make is human. They're what make us special, interesting and different from everybody else. If we all looked the same life would be extremely boring. Right? This book really made me think about how much the American culture focuses on looks and outer beauty and not enough on inner beauty. Your personality is a major part of who you are and it's more important that what you look like. Not only was this novel insightful but it was also an interesting science fiction book as well. It explained how a society like our own could be turned into a \\"perfect\\" world. It also made you realize that an entire world could cease to exist because of one person's mistake. Life is valuable and you shouldn't take it for granted. The biggest lesson I've taken from this book though is that our society needs to learn that looks aren't everything, personality is key. I'd recommend this book to everyone of all ages. Although it's categorized as a young adult novel, I think that boys and girls, young and old, will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully written book. I know I personally plan on reading the other two, Pretties and Specials and you should too!
0440238609|4.0|Despite all of the controversy (Pullman obviously takes issue with organized religion/monotheistic belief system), the story is very creative, well written, and worth the read. I don't believe that reading this story will yank any \\"faithful believers\\" away from their roots. I don't believe it will cause anyone to question their faith as a result of reading it, either. I would not recommend a child younger than 13 attempt the series- because there are some mature situations involving adultery, graphic violence, and subtle reference to sexuality.  All of those warnings aside, I am glad I attempted the whole series.  It gave me a lot to think about.
B000YAA6AU|4.0|So here is the thing. I don't watch many regular television programs so  have never seen some of the supporting cast and their trademark 'acts.'  I have never read the novel, P.S, I Love You. Or any other Ahern  writings. Never have seen any of the actors except Hilary Swank, Gerard  Butler and Kathy Bates. I don't know anything about walk-up apartments  in New York. (Seemed to bug some people.) I'm not an 'expert' on Irish  accents.    I caught the film for the second time 12/30 at the 10:35 a.m. showing;  there was an amazing crowd for a Sunday morning. The projection was  perfect. No microphones (complaints on some boards) on view. The sound  was great. That end song over the credits is a winner! And I loved it  more that I did the first time on the opening Friday morn, the 21st.    Holly is a real person, imperfect and annoying at times. Hilary Swank  is perfect. Those who want a 'babyface\\" child/woman to play Holly are  not living in the real world. There are more look-a-likes for Hilary  than the usual cookie-cutter cute young things Hollywood usually casts.  And Hilary has the chops to make us understand this childish woman and  how she starts the healing and growing up, with her Gerry's memory to  help.    I loved Lisa Kudrows questions to potentials. Very funny. I loved  Holly's quirky sister and thought she brought energy and sunshine to  her scenes. The boat scene is cliché' but funny all the same.    I still say the ballpark scene was not needed. They could have cut it  and the expense, and had the reading of the letter as voice-over.  Daniel and Holly 'were over' in the restaurant, and the audience knows  it. Daniel is an interesting \\"other man\\" and a new type. More  interesting than usual. But did anyone really think they would end up  together? Not me.    Bates is always good, but I just don't see that her part is 'wonderful'  as others keep saying. It's a part Bates can do in her sleep. The  Mother had never reconciled to the marriage and seemed waspish. Holly  had to overlook her disapproval while trying to find her way with her  husband.    I wonder how many scenes with James Marstars and Gina Gershon were left  on the cutting room floor. They were hardly in the film.    And Jeffrey Dean Morgan, although good looking in a grinny-goofy way,  hardly has any lines to say. And they are one-note. So not a great  impression.    The cinematography is gorgeous, from the streets of New York to the  Irish countryside.    Our audience today clapped when the 'Mustang Sally\\" scene started. More  energy and excitement there than in all the rest of the film. Gerry  Butler is Mr. Wonderful. Singing, flirting, great body language, and a  delicious deep kiss, at last. *sigh* I've upgraded my rating to a 9  from a 7.     Postcript: I didn't read this book and I have promised myself that I  will never buy a book thinking I will see it on film. Never happens. I  have promised myself I will not see every preview and teaser of a film  before I go to the theater.    The previews of PSILY were clips chopped up from 5 to 10 seconds and  did not show what the scenes they were from were about. I went thinking  I was seeing quite a different film, just from all the clips we were  able to see online and on TV. My first viewing was clouded by that  fact. I did not see what the preview seemed to say I should be seeing.    From now on I will go in like I did for \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\" -  knowing nothing, never having seen a preview. But I knew I loved the  music.    Or last years \\"The Departed.\\" I had never even heard of it and went  because I wanted to see the \\"300\\" preview on a big screen. But I loved  it.    This has taught me a lesson. I've seen one preview of \\"Nims Island\\" -  the next Butler film, out in April, and love what I see. Don't want to  read the book. I'll not be watching or reading about the film. Don't  want any more information than I have right now. That way, it is just  me and what's on the screen - and that's what it'sall about. One  person in the dark, reacting to what the director, crew and actors have  made for them. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. :) Jane
B000VNMMR0|4.0|I Just watched this movie and being a big fan of the franchise I didnt know what to expect. For me personally it exceded expectations and I really enjoyed it. 4 stars seems to be a solid rating for this movie. It really depends on what your own personal expectations are.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|The music is one of my favorite parts of this movie, so needless to say I enjoyed the soundtrack.  It contains all the music from the movie, including the drums and war-cries from the final battle.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|With so many impeccably credible refutations available from so many sources, it's amazing that 'new world order' politicians continue to get traction from this fraud. The public's acceptance of this scam betrays their addiction to feel-good sensationalism and intellectual laziness; ignoring lawsuits from scientists to force the IPCC to stop misrepresenting them, and, proclamations from the U.S. National Science Foundation invalidating Gore's high temperature claims. Neither has the British High Court's ban of the film - pending the correction of blatant lies such as the likelihood of coastal flooding - nor the Czechoslovakian president's warning that this movement represented \\"a greater danger than communism\\" registered with the public, at least as of yet.    What is most sad however, is that attacking CO2 (which results from rather than causes global warming), could deny its considerable agricultural benefits to many peoples and regions desperately in need of better nutrition and living conditions. Unfortunately, most people won't understand, until after the fact, that the Kyoto gang's objective is to shift the focus of taxation onto increasingly higher valued energy expenditures; away from decreasingly valuable payroll revenues as rising Asian productivity further depreciates Western wage bases. Gore actually explained this in his 2007 Congressional testimony, for anyone willing to open their eyes and ears. That's why The Washington Post's reaction to \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\" DVD was, \\"Devastating\\".
B00005JPTI|1.0|Boy was this a huge disappoinment.  I am a big fan of the two previous versions of the novelette by Richard Matheson but I don't think that even Jerry Bruckheimer could have made a bigger of a mess out of this storyline.           Why was Neville a legend and to whom was he a legend?  He was a legend among the still-half-humans (the ones who hadn't gone full-blown vampire yet) as the daystalker who goes around and kills them in their sleep.  He wasn't a legend because he found 'the cure' as this movie states at the end.  In the two previous films, the Neville character spent the daytime hours hunting and killing the vampires totally unaware that there was a small population of infected humans who weren't eating people yet.  In this latest remake they even show a scene of Neville marking off on a map the buildings that he had checked but this is NEVER explained in the film.  They completely removed the vampire hunting aspect from the story which makes the 'marking-off-buildings-checked' scene totally nonsensical.         This movie is yet another example of Hollywood signing a big star and casting him in an expensive CGI spectacular where he can run around doing amazing things before ultimately saving the day.  Well, they should have tried to save this story first.  It stinks.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This script is a poem, set to music.  The dialog is written with a distinct rhythm and tempo to match the awesome music!  The direction is absolutely brilliant with images reflecting the mood of the dialog. For example, when Scott is meeting with Barry Fife in the kitchen, the chef comes along and grabs a large piece of raw meat from in front of Scott - showing that the Dance Federation is treating Scott like a piece of meat, rather than as a person.  This movie is filled with imagery such as this, making it an absolute incredible work of art! I've seen this movie well over 100 times, and I still get chills whenever I hear those wonderful opening notes of The Beautiful Blue Danube. This is an awesome movie!

6304602944|5.0|To all ladies, this film is a real treat for the eyes!  I first saw this movie in a theater, and when Stallone and Russel are shown walking naked through the building, the entire audience of women collectively sighed in awe! The plot is great, and the banter between the two heroes is genuinely funny.  The action is never-ending, and both men and women will truly enjoy this fast-paced thriller!
B000003BD3|4.0|The Stones, John Lennon, Eric Clapton, The Who: A snapshot in Rock and Roll History, (before everyone grew to hate Yoko). I think one of the last live Stones shows with Brian. The Who are at their carnival best. Clapton does Yer' Blues better on the Live Peace in Toronto album, (when everyone started to hate Yoko). The rest of the players are just OK.
630460288X|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I did so because there was nothing else on the boob tube.  It quickly became one of my top 5 favorite films of all time. This script is so wonderfully fresh, and Stallone really shows his comic genius with his delivery.  Sandra Bullock was teriffic in this role, and although I've seen this film at least 50 times, it still makes me laugh and marvel at the clever plot and hilarious dialog.  I highly recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a great comedy and thrilling action!
B000VKW7AK|4.0|although this set may not have everything on it the dvd is worth the price of the whole thing to me. ive never saw them on dvd or live play better that they did there. though i was hesitant on buying this because of my dissapointment of the cannibal corpse, slayer and kiss boxsets where i pay over 50 bucks for a set of stuff i already have 75 percent of the material. this set from the awsome packaging and selection of songs just blew my mind. i just wish they would hve put everything that was xtra on the remaster on this and is why it dont get 5 stars. but they have to make their money somehow. this is just a great set for a longtime or new megadeth fan to get their hands on.
0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell could write about paint drying and make it fascinating. His New Yorker columns (sadly far more infrequent these days) are a joy. This book was fun to read - his usual flair for thought-provoking and interesting examples, well-written.<br /><br />Why only 4 out of 5 stars? Because I thought this book lacked a coherent overall argument. What is the bottom line? You should trust your gut instinct .... except in those cases where you shouldn't. He fails to make clear exactly what it is that distinguishes one situation from the other. As a result, the examples, while interesting to read, leave the reader unsure in the end what point Gladwell is really trying to make.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|this is the set ive been wanting for many years after all the teasers on their past vhs/dvd releases. no more just having one or two sogs from these shows now i have most if not all of these landmark shows. and with the msg bonus disc though short in lenghth and pyro is still a great added bonus to a already awsome set. and the added tv spots and the cadillac mini documentary make thi set all the more the special to own and view. i just hope volume 2 can be half this good.
0807126063|5.0|Is it just my perception or is the plot in this book exquisitely crafted?  There are no loose ends, no incidents that are not essential to the climax & denouemont (as it were). The first 20 times or so that I read it (no exaggeration), I read for humor, voice, characterization and all those things reviewers have mentioned. Then the crystalline beauty of the plot structure began to reveal itself to me.  There's not one extra incident in the book, even Miss Annie's hanging slip strap contributes, no, is essential. Everything is set up like a row of dominoes in the first two-thirds of the book; after that, everything that happens HAS to happen the way it does, yet for all that you don't see it coming.
B000JJRIP2|3.0|ok i went to best but to get the version with bonus tracks which werent included anywhere else (or at best buy lol). they sent replacement discs to the stores which i never got cuz some great mind put the 2 bonus tracks on a site for a week to download. now everyone knows kiss alive is one of if not the best live album ever. i think alive 2 is but thats probally because it was my 1st 8 track tape and it holds special memories fo me. but now on here they made it possible to sueeze rock n roll all nite onto alive 2 so all 4 alive have it included, oh joy. alive 3 was not the best live album ever but damn solid and half the material was from the non make-up days back when they still liked to create music and the added track of take it off is nice to have on cd. now the show formerly known as alive 4 aka the millenium show is probally a pretty good show if there was video backing it up. but on cd it may be nice to have as a fan but not a enjoyable listening experience. now for some reason alive 1 and 2 were always 2 cd sets when seperate. now they cram them on 1 cd each now that they dont have to worry about socking you for them a 2 cd sets. but overall it is nice to have this all together but why not throw the unplugged show in there that was live? and there was a lost alive with songs that wee on alive 1 that could have ben included to make it more worth the money. but again like the big box set this has great packaging and a nice booklet inside. but heres just another way to get the die hards to cough up 40 bucks on something they already have 75 percent of. 3 stars for awsome packaging.
1594481717|5.0|I was very impressed with the information provided in the book and the new thought processes of people... esp the newer generation.

B000VWYJ86|4.0|The Bourne Ultimatum may bring a close to the Bourne movies.  As one of the series, it is a great movie.  As a closer, it still leaves too much to be desired.    This installment is very rushed and at times I had a feeling things were being left out for the sake of time.  However, it is still a great ride, with amazing special effects and fight scenes.  The only real downer for me is the crazy camera work.    Bourne remembers more about who he is now and where he came from and succeeds in taking his fight to those made him into what he is.  That is essentially the movie in a nutshell.  There is no romance, no real insight into Bourne's inner emotions (like there was in the first and second films).  In the first film we got a feeling for what Bourne was struggling with and in the second film we got to see an emotional side of him followed by what he could be when he was a cold and methodical agent.  Here, though, it seems like Bourne isn't getting fleshed out as much into a person so much as he's just another actor caught up in the roller coaster ride.  We see what is driving him, but never much about his feelings as much as his reactions.  As others have already said this movie is all about action.  Not all...but pretty close.  And that is OK, it just makes it a poor closing chapter in the trilogy.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I LOVE Dexter.  Michael C. Hall is an amazing actor.  I loved his character on Six Feet Under, so I was very excited for him to be in another series.  While this show has many dark tones, it stays upbeat with humor.  Cable TV has ruined regular television programming for me.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I was captured by the atmosphere in this enchanted movie the moment I saw it. Jane Eyre played by Ruth Wilson is magically present with every fiber of her being and the love between Mr Rochester and herself makes me really believe it every inch of the way. For me this is not just another love story, it also tells the story of a woman who is born with an inner strength most of us would envy. With very few woman to admire in my upbringing, this has actually become a valuable peace of my life.
0345494997|5.0|Loving Frank is the astounding story of his relationship with perhaps the great love of his life--Mamah Borthwick. While the book centers on her as a biography, the reader is able to capture the nuances of the architect's life and talent. The ending of the book is shocking, so if you are not up to tragic endings, you probably should not read the last few chapters.
B000VBP38C|5.0|I had seen this movie previously in digital and there were so many details that are missed in that version.  Near the beginning, you are aware that the Bennett family is not well to do just by looking at the porch of their house.  It's a wonderful story and the outdoor scenes are magnificent looking.  Keira Knightley has a face born to be in the movies and hd does very well by her.  If you like this film and have an hd dvd player, I strongly recommend you add this to your library.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|If you loved the original film, you will be mesmerized by this remastered version. Everyone who viewed this film by Stanley Kubrick commented on its period details and mastery of characterization. Bravo!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|The Gilmore Girls series was a Xmas gift for my Grand Daughter.  I am not familiar with the show, BUT I was the \\"Mistress of gift giving\\" when she saw what I had gotten for her.    Have since been told, the DVDs are of excellent quality and I apparently got a good deal on the price.  Saw the same item priced $60 higher at a local store.
B000XFVIMQ|3.0|Edit: For once warner actually heard the voices of America and did something about that mess. I received a replacement blu \\"fixed\\" of those problems. I am giving it an extra star for that!    If you use that, it's the only way to watch the show in 1080p. If you just played it, it'll go straight into 1080i! I really regret this purchase and wait a response from warner on that issue.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|Someday someone needs to shoot the definitive biopic of Johnny Cash, one of the American music scene's most storied and talented figures, because Walk the Line isn't anything like that. Yes, it's not supposed to be about Johnny Cash as much as it is about his stormy early relationship with his soul mate June Carter, but even insofar as it is that, Walk the Line is not even a very strong love story. Good performances are here, though, from several actors, but I was disappointed in Walk the Line, mostly because this film wasn't what it could have been or should have been or what I wanted it to be. I know it wasn't my production and others, including Johnny Cash, who gave his approval to the project before his passing, made this the story they wanted to tell, but speaking personally, I think this was both a needless assault on a cherished myth and a bit of a tall tale in itself that sacrificed fact for drama and re-wrote entire timelines. I know we live in the golden age of bringing down heroes and showing that the famous are as fallible as the rest of us, but why on earth concentrate on the aspects of the Cash's relationship that were so overly emphasized in Walk the Line? And then why re-imagine them when the truth made a better story in itself? Johnny Cash was a legend and deserves his own tribute in film. Maybe someday.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I picked up this DVD not expecting much, having not heard anything about it.  I was pleasantly surprised and entertained throughout!  Some of the comedy of the film seemed to be right out of Monty Python.    Tristan is the son of an enslaved princess from a forbidden fantasy land behind a long wall which is guarded by an old man.  One day his father gives him a letter from his mother and Tristan decides to go beyond the wall to find her.  The old man prevents him from getting past and Tristan must resort to a magical candle to propel him to the fantasy land.      When he arrives he encounters a Star in human form (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The star is being sought after by an evil prince as well as an evil witch (Michelle Pheiffer).   The movie goes along as Tristan must protect the Star from the evil forces.  Along the way he meets a \\"sky\\" captain (Robert DeNiro) and a band of sky pirates that help him.    This movie had me drawn in from start to finish and even with some really silly parts thrown in, it is a very entertaining film!
0525457585|2.0|I have heard it said that you should not judge a book by it's movie, which is usually supposed to mean that the book is better than the film but in this case the opposite is true (if comparing it to the first 80's movie because they go seriously down hill after that).    The book starts off well and contains the same or similar and additional scenes as seen in the movie and it was interesting to see how things were different and to experience the things left out of the film.    The first half of the book is pretty good, once in the middle that is where the first movie ends and from then on up until the very end Bastian spends his time going from one random wish to another venturing through Fantasia which is a real drag up until the last 8 or so chapters. It was so boring I almost stopped reading the book.    Basically what happens from the middle onwards (I'm going to tell you because it is not worth buying this book) is that Bastian gets the AURYN which gives him the ability to wish for anything so he goes from one wish to another which usually involves him going from one place to another meaning there is little in the way of character development. All the places he goes to are pretty strange and at times very unrealistic.    Bastain, Atreyu, and Falkor fall out quite soon in to the second half of the book because Bastian ends up being very arrogant because he has all this power and after trying to crown himself emperor of Fantasia Atreyu marches an army to the Ivory tower and attacks Bastian there, sadly the tower is destroyed.    Eventually Bastian gets it in to his head (after many people trying to tell him) that all this wishing is causing him to loose his memories and he will get stuck in Fantasia if he does not return to his world ASAP, so he is magically drawn to this place where he meets Atreyu and Falkor and they help him to return to the human world and finally Bastian runs home to his daddy like the little boy he is.    This book is definitely aimed at kids so that is probably why I did not like it so much. The lack of character development and any real plot put a dampener on things. Basically all the latter half of the book contains is Bastian wishing for thing and then his wish coming true and he goes to some crazy place. The book does try to save itself near the end and it was interesting to see what was going to happen to Bastian and how he would get back to the human world.    Other things that annoyed me about the book where the really long and stupid character names, for example \\"Vooshvandervool\\" or something like that or one of the characters. Also quite often throughout the book the author says \\"but that's another story for another time\\" to avoid having to fill out story for a number of characters.    While the green and purple text was a good idea, the green text is a little hard to read in some light (my bedside lamp) and on many pages in my copy of the book some of the characters that made up the words were not well formed. The author also seems to have an obsession with colour because many of the people and things in the story are some strange colour, for example Atreyu has green skin and Buffalo are pink.    While this book was probably pretty good back when it was written in the late 70's I doubt that today's kids would find it that interesting. Ask them to choose between the likes of Harry Potter and this book and Harry Potter is going to win just about every time. Also I don't like the thinking behind this book, what it will teach kids is that if you want anything just wish for it and then nearer the end of the book it gives off the idea that you should not wish for anything otherwise you will loose your memories and become stupid because you can't remember anything; I don't want my kids learning such things.    So to summarise, if you really liked the 80's movie when you were younger it's probably best to leave it at that. If you are looking for a good fantasy story with some depth, realism, grandeur or character development then you will probably be disappointed with this book.
0823013626|5.0|Donna Kato's new book, with photographs by her husband Vernon Ezell and a foreword by Carol Duvall, covers a wide range of techniques and styles.  Kato's work defies categorization, covering nostalgic pieces, modern pieces, whimsical items, Asian-inspired items, and even sculpture.  Her versatility is amazing.  Her teaching ability is wonderful, and through the many photographs we get to see her flawless craftmanship in action.  I was especially intrigued by her Brocade Technique and by a watercolor-y bead, done with alcohol-based inks and a rubber stamp of some handwriting.<br /><br />Always breaking new ground, Kato gives us a collection of stylish, artistic and creative techniques.  She carefully explains each one, along with reasons why she chose the materials she used.  She includes work from other artists as well, making this a well-rounded and extremely useful book.  It doesn't get any better than this!

B000YENUI6|5.0|When Vigo and Cronenberg teamed up for A History of Violence, I was intrigued by the house the two of them built. The character Tom Stall (portrayed by Vigo) became more and more interesting as the tallies of personal viewings went onward and upward, and the little things Cronenberg brought to the table were much more amazing than I first thought. The ideals denoted in a simple array of light and dark, the layers of persona wrapped inside a puzzle that was more interesting as it was poked at and slowly drew moths to its flame, and this seemed all-the-more promising when Eastern promises debuted.<br />Cronenberg and Mortenson; I never thought that one would act as a tributary that expressed itself through-and-through.<br /><br />In Eastern Promises, the viewer is again given a puzzle and asked to see it through by starting them off with a pregnant \\"woman\\" (her age is a sad affair in and of itself) begging for someone to help her. By the end of the day she is dead, there is an Eastern European baby that sets unclaimed, and one doctor that wonders what this all means. Helping her find footing amongst the broken pieces of this \\"woman's\\" life is a diary find amongst her thins, and the trail of breadcrumbs the book (written in a language she can not translate) leads her to some REALLY bad people with REALLY bad habits.<br />You really have to love Cronenberg's idea of what the baddies do.<br /><br />When watching Eastern Promises, I felt that the movie engaged me from the get-go and asking me deeper rooted questions along the way. It asked how far a person should go to do something they believed in, and it asked how much someone should sacrifice when dealing with all types of proverbial devils that did something you found hard to ignore. I personally liked that because, much like History of Violence, it engaged a viewer on a mainstream front and it allowed a person to question the legitimacy of the way the characters saw the world. Chronenberg likes duality of things, too, and that duality sometimes works as the stepping stones to help a viewer connect with the idea a director is portraying. Seeing the \\"mafia\\" going to town on a set of fingers and then setting up a child's party by putting balloons on a ceiling - the notion of family and the notion of loyalty may become extreme depending on the moment BUT you can see what makes it important.<br />Ideas like this become the gateway drugs that make some terrible things almost understandable and Cronenberg makes me happy with the way this comes through.<br /><br />The same can be said with the people on the masks of both horror and hero, with Vigo leading the way and really pulling off his role. When I heard that he would be adding \\"accent\\" to the role I was somewhat afraid, knowing how he had done a lot of things well but not really envisioning him wearing a chilling vocal overcoat cast of the Eastern European persuasion, but he as amazing as it did so. Equally impressive was the persona he took on; tattooed to the gills and seemingly Siberian in the cold manner with which he went about his work, he sold the role and added in feelings I was unaccustomed to in that type of killer. The rest of the cast was solid as well, making the world Cronenberg crafted one that I could see existing.<br /><br />Well worth seeing, gory plus story plus a little something-something that detaches digits at an alarming speed; to me that's everything a Holiday tale requires and especially so when you tire of the tinsel and the Carolers and all that other frill.etimes works as the stepping stones to help a viewer connect with the idea a director is portraying.

B00008PX8P|5.0|If you consider yourself a true Zeppelin fan, you will want to watch them in concert anywhere, anytime and anyhow!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I never used to be the kind of obsessive fan that shows like Star Trek, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Twin Peaks can turn their viewers into; I never camped out in front of movie theatres waiting for the opening of any chapters in the Star Wars saga or any of the Harry Potter films. I was never one for analyzing those types of movies or television shows looking for the hidden philosophical meaning or contemporary social metaphors. I never contributed to online fan discussions where people share theories or talk of character development. That's not who I was. I enjoyed those shows and movies on a very superficial level; I watched (sometimes half-watched) for the snappy dialogue, the eye-popping visuals, and the emotional payoff. Then, in September of 2005, the first season of LOST was released on DVD; almost a year after the show premiered. My friends and I watched the entire first season in one and a half days; we did not eat and we did not sleep. We canceled whatever plans we had for that weekend and just planted ourselves in front of the television set, getting up only to grab a drink from the fridge or to use the restroom. We were hooked. In between episodes we would ask questions. What do you think the monster is? Where the hell are they? Do you think Locke is good? There was something building up inside of me; something foreign and powerful. Then, when Locke and Jack were staring into the hatch and the screen cut to black and the familiar thump and flash of the show's title burst on the screen, the feeling of some powerful emotion growing inside of me burst forth and overtook me completely: my new obsession was born.   The minute the first season ended I was on my computer looking up anything and everything I could find about this crazy, mysterious show. I checked out fan sites and reviews and blogs, absorbing all that I could. I would nod my head in emphatic agreement about some fan's theories, or I would yell and wave my arms in dissent at a post I felt was way off the mark. LOST is unlike any other show I have known because it turns television viewers into active participants, inspiring people to theorize and analyze and criticize. People are writing books and blogs and long-winded DVD reviews. This show gets people talking. It's nice to know that I am the only one not obsessed.    To be clear, my obsession has not been steady. There have been times when I don't even think about the show. When the second season premiered my friends and I were once again on the couch, with the kind of nervous anticipation and excitement one usually experiences when a lover returns home from months of schooling or working abroad. I was wondering how the show has changed, if the show has changed. How have I changed? What secrets were being held in that damn hatch? Then it was revealed: the hatch was some kind of bunker or station for a group performing scientific experiments on the island. There was such a feeling of disappoint. I wanted the contents of the hatch to be something far more sinister and mysterious, supernatural even. My friends shared my feeling of being let-down and the show lost them forever, they went back to their lives. I stayed on hoping for the best. With each episode, I felt my obsessions waning. The monster was shown to be a malevolent plume of black smoke that flashed pictures; something mechanical when I wanted something organic or, again, supernatural. Nothing was turning out like I thought it should. The characters were changing. What happened to the strong, naturalistic, Locke? For much of season two we were given a button obsessed, cry-baby. Then came the Others and Henry Gale. Slowly, my faith in the show was being restored. The Others were introduced so beautifully, effortlessly woven into the mythology of the show. Michael Emerson's portrayal of Henry Gale was mysterious, powerful; it's amazing how that little man can turn everything upside down with just a few manipulating words or a sinister little smirk.The character of Henry Gale breathed a new life into the show and my obsession, something the introduction of the tail section failed to do. I began asking questions again. What exactly were the Dharma Initiative studying? Were the Others the last vestiges of the Initiative? What did those images in the smoke mean? How can smoke have killed the pilot of Flight 815 as violently as it did? I was once again, as intrigued as ever. It was at this point when I realized the creators and writers had something bigger planned.  Season three premiered. Ratings fell and interest in the show declined. This was blamed on the first six episodes, which were considered to be weak, and a long thirteen week hiatus. Viewers jumped ship while loyalists like me stuck with the show because we knew there was a plan. To confirm this knowledge was the announcement of final ending in 2010; three more season, sixteen episodes each. As the season went on the episodes improved considerably. There were some misses accompanying the hits; I could have lived my whole life without watching Hurley and the guys drink beer and fix a dilapidated ole' VW bus. But some of the show's most brilliant episodes were in season three: \\"The Man from Tallahassee\\", \\"The Man Behind the Curtain\\", \\"The Brig\\". The season finale, \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", is still being discussed. I loved season three and am constantly defending the caliber of these episodes when they are compared to the first and second seasons.   When I am in a social setting and bring up LOST, there is such a sense of relief when someone else says, \\"Oh, I love that show!\\" This not only validates my obsession, but gives me a conversational companion for the duration of the event. But when no one shares my feelings, and I am alone in a room filled with non-viewers, I am almost hurt. When the naysayers talk about how confusing the show is, or how they can't believe LOST is still on the air, I am extremely protective of the show. I find myself using horrible arguments in the show's defense: \\"You're just too stupid to understand what the show is trying to do.\\" \\"It makes sense that you don't like this show because you have the attention span of a five year old.\\" \\"Why aren't you watching this show? Too busy watching The Hills?\\" This is the wrong tactic. I need to be tactful in my efforts to convert people into loyal LOST viewers.  I need to tell them that LOST is a mysterious, often scary, often touching, layered story, not unlike a novel. I need to tell them that getting involved in the LOST world is like reading a good book on a rainy day. I need to tell them to devote a couple weekends to the first three DVD sets before trying to get into season four at the end of January. I need to tell them to take a little time to read the blogs and the theories and listen to the podcasts hosted by executive producers, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. I need to tell people that there is a definite beginning, middle, and end to this story and it would be a mistake to miss out on it.  In other words, non-viewers, please share in my obsession.
0142000663|5.0|This novel follows the travails of the Joad family as they migrate from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression. Because very little internal dialogue is presented, the Joads and other characters seem just plain stupid. However, by their actions one realizes they have a dignity and intelligence that is not obvious at first. They struggle against misfortune as best they can. In depicting the life of the Joads, the novel offers a vivid portrayal of the lives of many who suffered through the Great Depression. On a broader level this work also provides a commentary on government, religion, and politics. The climactic scene is meaningful but does not flow from the preceding chapters, and the ending is odd and will make you wonder what the message is.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, one may realize that this story is not just about the Joads, but a story of all Americans, no matter what the background. This is truly one of the greatest novels of American literature.
B000066RZ6|5.0|I'm surprised about the reception of this album even with fans as there has been a lot of negative banter regarding this album and most of it, in my opinion, is misplaced. Heathen is most probably David Bowie's greatest work and high water mark of his career. Heathen is definitely as I have stated before, one of the best albums of the past decade.<br /><br />Sure, people could start going on about Heroes, Bowie's Berlin years, Ziggy, the eighties ad infinitum, but I think all that pales in comparison to this album. From start to finish, Heathen not just delivers as a solid album - but it continues to deliver like one of those forever present concept-albums that people often talk about being timeless, like Weezer's Blue Album, U2's Joshua Tree, The Beatle's Sgt. Pepper, Clapton's Unplugged or Moody Blue's Day's of Future Passed. All these albums are looked at in their sense of inhabiting the overall. Heathen is now, another addition and Bowie pulls it off masterfully.<br /><br />I became aware of this album after watching Conan O'Brien one night and seeing Bowie perform two songs (I think Cactus and Everyone Says Hi) from this and was absolutely floored at the man and his uber-ethnic super group ... a band that would put even Supertramp, or Sting's World Band Collective to shame. About a week later, Bowie was on again and preformed two different songs and directly after, I left the house and went looking for this thing in the middle of the night like a dope fiend.<br /><br />Heathen starts off darkly and almost like a mass with Sunday but then goes directly into a confession with a song that seems like a real-life problem from Bowie's everyday grind. Cactus comes across like Bowie is reading a letter, sent to his wife from a crazed fan who wants Iman's dirty dress and a sample of David Bowie's / The Great White Duke's / Thomas Newton's blood. The First Act closes with Slip Away, a story about a fading TV celebrity and his puppet which is probably one of the best tracks on the entire album and has Bowie playing a litany of strange, almost unnameable instruments.<br /><br />From this point in the album, it seems to almost separate with its energetic mid-section which is more reminiscent of Bowie's work from the early nineties. Act two is: Slow Burn, Afraid, and I've been waiting for you.<br /><br />Act Three is I took a trip on a Gemini Spaceship and 5:15 the Angles have gone, which also seem separate styles of Bowie's that hearken back to his early days, the Berlin years and even his days as his alter-ego Ziggy Stardust, but 5:15 seems connected to the closing portion of the album as many have stated which is Everyone says Hi, my favorite A Better Future, which sounds as if the writing is a lost track from Heroes and the grand exeunt - Heathen (The Rays).<br /><br />During the release of this album David Bowie went on tour, but apparently toured strictly near his home in the five Burroughs of New York playing to sold out crowds in small pubs, bars and local nightclubs. The idea of this alone is absolutely enthralling and gives this album added depth knowing that the people who got in to see the show, heard this album live and in an intimate and very fulfilling setting. For Bowie fans this was probably the ultimate gift to them. Anyone who speaks ill of this album probably hasn't really listened to it ... or hasn't `heard' it.and has Bowie playing a litany of strange, almost unnameable instruments.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|probably the best, or at least one of the best pixar movies created so far. The animation seems so real yet is nice and cartoony at the same time, and the story line is not predictable and stays away from cliches that are plaguing so many kids movies. A true family movie since just about everyone will enjoy this.    And the music's great too.

0385513755|5.0|I don't really get into reading books very often. Never seems to hold my attention, but this book was great. Could not put it down. The book writes much about symbolism and refers to many works of art so the illustrations help considerably. If you liked the movie, you will love the book. There is much more detail to learn of.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|My only complaint specifically with the last few seasons of Gilmore Girls is that the case has each DVD overlapping another, so you can't take just one DVD out of the case, you have to take two out and put the one back that you didn't want.  Same thing to put them back in.  They also tend to wear more quickly with this kind of packaging, nor do they lock in as well.  Why they decided to change the packaging from the first few seasons to this I'll never understand, but other than that this was exactly what I expected.
B00005AUC4|5.0|How good is this movie?  With over 300 reviews on this site, most of them 5 star, it's probably all been said, but for my own 2 cents, George Clooney re-impresses me again with his utterly hilarious playing of Ulysses Everett McGill.  I start laughing just when I think of these guys!  Pete and Delmar!  Dapper Dan hair gel!  And the rockin roots blues and bluegrass that give a whole other level of earnestness to the story. For soundtrack and cinematography alone the movie could take awards.  But it's greatest acheivement is the performance of the actors and the very hilarious dialalogues and scenarios that run throughout the movie. Nothing less than 5 stars will do!      My import version (Japan zone 2) has lots of interviews and behind the scenes shots as well as a video (\\"I am a man of constant sorrow\\"), trailers, etc.  It doesn't have subtitles in English however.  Japanese or none.
031286504X|5.0|I AM LEGEND is a classic apocalyptic survivor (at least for a while) story.  When you consider that LEGEND was written in 1954, the story concept is even more outstanding.  It is very well written and fascinating in its charactor depth.  It is no wonder that LEGEND has been made into three successful movies.  If you have loved any of the movies, read the origional story.  You won't regret it.  The book also includes some short stories that are less outstanding.

This movie delivers what it's supposed to and that's plenty of non stop action! Of course, it's all over the top but who cares.

0743486285|5.0|I can't begin to describe how powerful this book is.  If you are from Gen X, you can relate to some of the things that Nikki went through, even if you didn't 'experience' life like he did.  Whether or not you did, this book is a fantastic example of how 'human' our 'idols' or 'role models' are.  Yes, you can argue how much entertainment stars or athletes are 'role models', but like it or not, people, especially kids, try to emulate them.  It also makes you wonder how lonely other musicians who aren't 'living life after death' (read the book if you don't understand)really were: Kurt Cobain, Andrew Wood, Hillel Slovack (spelling?), Shannon Hoon, etc.  I gave the book and soundtrack to my nephew who wasn't even born until 1989, so he can hopefully see how strong drugs and alcohol can be and how they can alter your life.  He didn't know who Nikki was, but he has already said, 'Wow' to the pages he has thumbed through.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Just like the book, I can't describe how powerful this soundtrack is.  I have actually seen people cry because of how their lives are reflected in some of the songs: Accidents can Happen, Life is Beautiful, Permission.  If you've ever struggled with addiction or wonder what it's like, listen to this soundtrack and read the book....
B00005JPNW|5.0|Some changes were made in the sequence of events, and some characters were changed/combined (to make the adaptation flow better), but overall it was very true to the feel of the novel and to the personalities of the main characters. It has an amazing cast. On top of all that, the theme song is by Kate Bush. This is by far the best film I saw in 2007. I hope the sequels get made!
0374280967|4.0|This book is fun to read; it is done with a light touch by its talented author.  Its premise, that QEII's life is altered by serious reading, is clever and believable.  The theme is similar to one found in Chekhov's short story \\"The Bet,\\" in which a man is transformed by extended reading under different circumstances.  The author has several light jabs at those in power who do not read for pleasure.  All in all, it is good; however one suspects that those who pick up this book will be those who are already convinced of the joy of reading.
0439882826|5.0|This Pop Up Book is AMAZING!! We saw this book in a book store in Las Vegas, but could not get it home so I went searching fot it on line. We got it completely protected in plastic so it can be preserved. Each page has a pop up inside a pop up. It tells a story and has light up light sabers. It is utterly unbelievable! A true collectable or coffee table piece. A definite must have for any Star Wars buff or anyone that likes interesting books!
0688101364|3.0|I haven't yet attempted any of the recipes in this book yet, but I have looked through it. There seems to be a lot of unique and little known cookies. Some of the recipes seem quite complex. I would not recommend this for someone that just wants a good compilation of easy Christmas cookies. There are quite a lot of ethnic recipes that might be good for surprising grandma or grandpa with something they haven't had in quite a while.
B000002KIE|5.0|Shame upon those unfortunate gobsters whose only appreciation for this album has led them to reckless self absorbed navular gazing. As a confessed teenage punk in Britain in the Seventies John Lydon and Mr Ritchie were my prophets of doom, snarling and sickly scintillating, and NMTB was my DIY manual to anything and everything I wanted, even though I didn't know what that exactly was; I just knew I had a desire to be something, somebody, somewhere... and through the mists of the Dole I survived as an artist (of sorts), a writer and a culinary chef... and to be equally fair to the heavenly powers that be, I have had more than my equal share of fame.    But this is not all about me... I only wanted to indicate in a suitably appropriate fashion the impact that this music can have on the mind of one  in active thought, seeking, embracing and prepared to fight their way out of poverty and depression, social injustice and economic oppression... NMTB inspires a revolt against conformity, it is provocative, it is the voice of anger, bristling with rage, boiling over yet also finely disciplined and prepared to last the course.    Many of the tracks have become classics; Anarchy in the UK (the only true anthem of dissent; listen up Wat Tyler!), God Save the Queen (even John Peel was prevented from playing that on air!) EMI (the music industry - still too true), Pretty Vacant (a very good reason not to answer the telephone other than to tell your dictatorial boss where the next full stop is), and all the rest.    And so to sum it all up; raw, undiluted, primal, undigestable, provocative and cursive... sometimes its hard to bare the anguish of an imposed desolation, a society that doesn't seem to care too much but these tracks stand as a testimony; the ultimate proof that with the right attitude anybody can accomplish their dream.    Forget all the other fakes, choose the real thing and be it!

Murnau's NOSFERATU look like it was shot YESTERDAY!  Thank you gods of modern restoration technology for the absolute thrill of seeing a silent classic I've adored all my film loving life in a way I never thought possible!  It is an astonishing experience to see NOSFERATU so clean, clear and pristine! Add to that the original score in 5.1 surround, and you have a true cinema lover's definition of Nirvana. I nearly wept with joy watching this! My mouth was agape in wonder and disbelief! Every 5 seconds I kept saying, \\"I don't believe this! LOOK AT THIS!\\" My dear fellow movie lovers...trying to explain HOW BEAUTIFUL...HOW AMAZING this restoration truly is...well...it just can not be expressed in mere words! YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!! It is an accomplishment of epic mind boggling proportions! IT LOOKS BRAND NEW!!!! When I think of how Bram Stoker's widow wanted all prints destroyed...not to mention all the various crappy public domain versions available...I was sure this would be one of those silent film classics that would always look like a scratchy, old, beat up mess.  And even THEN, it STILL was amazing! Now...be still my heart!! Dracula truly has risen from the grave with fresh new virgin sprocket blood and he will now live forever...beautifully ugly, cinematically young and vibrant!  The extras are fun too...especially the excerpts from Murnau's other films...scenes that really show what a true genius he was...years ahead of his time...and still unmatched in originality, vision and brilliance! (And what a difference seeing it at 18 frames a second makes! It's a whole new movie with performances that no longer have that typical sped up feel and exaggerated silent movie overacting.) This DVD set is one for the ages!  Thank you Kino for making my life all the more sweeter by restoring yet another cinematic silent masterpiece.  In a word...\\"Wow!\\" Not to be missed.silent masterpiece.  In a word...\\"Wow!\\" Not to be missed.
B00005JPTI|5.0|I thought this movie was very good, and wanted to see it again the next day. The CG was a little unbelievable and reminded me of the movie \\"The Mummy\\". Other than that, I felt the story was very good, and the acting top notch. The end was a shocker, and was totally unexpected, but it just made the movie that much better. I plan to buy this video when it is released and will be in my special collection of favorites.
1594489505|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than \\"Kite Runner.\\" It gives us a view of the Muslim world, while depicting the unstable events in the recent history of Afganistan.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|What can I say? LOST is the best.<br />Behind the scenes and bonus features on these DVDs are excellent. Well worth the money.

B000OYC7A8|5.0|David Gilmore is an excellent guitarist that does not rely on flashy playing to get his message across to the audiences that he plays for. David has his own immediatly recognizable playing style, that is often imitated by others. You could always recognize his immense influence on all of the Pink Floyd Records, from \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\", to the very latest albums.    This DVD is very valuble to me, because it shows David as a very down to earth performer, whom is always interested in releasing only the best product that is possible. This DVD has Pink Floyd songs,and songs from all of David's excellent solo albums, especially from \\"On An Island\\".    You can't go wrong with this DVD if you want to see what life is like on tour now days. It is nice to see that David now takes his family on tour with him. Gone are the days of the wild parties, and groupies.
075640407X|5.0|My son received this book for Christmas but I read it before he did. He is reading it now and has loved every word so far. Rothfuss is a talented storyteller. He does not rely on tense moments full of blood and gore or intrigue to keep you hooked. His gift is in telling the story of a man who is bigger than life but still just a man finding his way through life like everyone else. The characters are well developed, humorous at times and well fleshed out. He doesn't feel the need to go into every detail of the culture, politics, history or religion at every opportunity but takes his time filling in the gaps, slowly building Quothe's world. I would not compare the author to George R.R. Martin, Terry Goodkind or Robert Jordan, all of whom I love. Patrick is poetic in a way that reminds me of a bard coming to court and telling a story over a period of days. Those stories stick with you a long time. If you are looking for something different from the Fantasy currently on the shelves, then I would recommend the book.
0590259385|5.0|I love this book! It is so cute! I bought it as a gift and had to get it for my kids too!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|what a beautiful compilation...great sound...and the dvd is wonderful...it is a bit of a teaser for other video collections which have come or are coming out...if you don't already have a substantial zep library, or if you want this wonderful track list in a more compact format, then grab this...
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|this is a case where technology is slightly ahead of the film industry...i cannot say whether the movie was filmed in hd...but i think it probably was not...the sound is stunningly accurate, the sonic separation fantastic, but the image quality is about what a regular dvd would have been...so i think the movie industry is progressively catching up to the blue ray medium...enjoy...
1427201412|5.0|I've been hooked on Austen and now I'm hooked on Austenland.  I haven't actually read it but I love listening to Katherine Kellgren reading it to me.  She does a great job of doing the different voices of the various characters.  She could make the dictionary interesting. No slight to Shannon Hale's abilities meant.  This was my first of her books, I'm reading Goose Girl now so I'll have more of an opinion after I've read more of her books, but so far so good.       Lots of fun.  L.A.M.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you've ever hung out at the local music store. If you've ever carried around a beat up instrument, If you've ever longed for an instrument you couldn't afford. If you've ever felt most comfortable with people, who enjoyed the same music as you, this is definitely a film with which you can relate. I would agree, it's not Citizen Kane (ho hum), but it's definitely uplifting and honest. I played this on Christmas day and as the music unfolded, my relatives gradually congregated around the TV to watch and enjoy Guy and Girl. Smiles and Tears. Please buy or rent this film and experience what we found to be truly uplifting. \\"If your mind's made up......\\"

B000YABYLA|5.0|Her parents didn't see it coming.  They were hoping she'd been expelled, into hard drugs, anything but pregnant.     Well, Juno (Ellen Page) was hoping that, too.  It took 3 pregnancy tests to convince her.     Juno tried the abortion clinic first, but couldn't go through with it.  Her friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) convinces her to check out the Penny Saver for adoptive parents--or as she puts it couples 'desperately seeking spawn.'    She finds Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), who seem to be the ideal couple.  Vanessa has always wanted to be a Mom--and Juno and Mark have so much in common.       \\"Juno\\" takes us through a year of young Juno's life, including her relations with the father of her baby and her best friend, Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), school, and the pregnancy and aftermath.    The film takes you on the gamut of emotions, but leaves you feeling good. I saw this film with my husband, who loved \\"Juno\\" as much as I did.  We'll probably end up buying this DVD, because it's well worth another watch.      Warnings:    Some mature subject themes may not be suitable for really young kids, but I'd definitely take my young adults to this film.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Ok, so I'm going to go with the hundreds of reviews previously who indicated that this movie is FANTASTIC!     I just want to add that the HD version is even more spectacular! When I first got my HD Player 11/07, this was the first movie I purchased (and watched) and was blown away by the new depths of detail and color. The space scenes are phenomenal and I have been hard pressed to find a HD DVD that has lived up to the quality of this one. It is even SO much better than an upconverted DVD.     If you have a HD player (or are thinking about getting one), this movie should be purchased and viewed in full HD! It's the only movie I own multiple copies of :) !
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), wife Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), and their baby daughter live happily in their tiny upstairs rooms off Fleet Street until Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) takes a fancy to Lucy. His Honor sends Barker off to Australia on a false charge.    15 years later, Barker returns a much changed man.  He's Sweeney Todd now and set on getting regaining his old life.  When Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) advises him that Turpin raped his wife, Lucy, causing her to take poison, then took his daughter Johanna as his ward, Todd swears vengeance.     And a bloody vengeance it is.  It begins with the 'necessary' killing of a man who recognizes Todd for who he is and wishes to blackmail him. But, Todd's silver knives are hungry for blood--and so is he.      Meanwhile, Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) falls in love with Johanna (Jayne Wisener) as he passes beneath her window.  The pair plan to elope. He takes Sweeney into his confidence, little knowing that Sweeney is not as sympathetic to the cause of young love as he seems.     The tale is filmed dark as only Tim Burton can do it and accompanied by Sondheim's glorious compositions, full of ironic humor and just plain gorgeous orchestration. But don't let that fool you, \\"Sweeney\\" is not a musical you could take your choir class to on a field trip.  It's a story that'd put Upton Sinclair off his feed.      Warnings:    Blood and guts--if you have a hard time with these, \\"Sweeney\\" may not be your kind of film; however, the blood's been tinted strawberry red, so the effect is greatly lessened.
B00081U6EG|4.0|I finally picked up a copy of this DVD as a Gary Moore fan after reading the mixed reviews here on amazon.  This concert, somewhat similiar to Eric Clapton's Crossroads guitar festival, has recieved some negative reviews here mostly because of the guitarists who were not included in the show. I judged this show by the performances in it instead of worrying about who was left out and I wasn't disappointed. Despite the absence of Eric Clapton and a few others I would've liked to see, this is still an enjoyable presentation with plenty of strong performances by Albert Lee, Hank Marvin, David Gilmour, Paul Rodgers, Paul Carrack, and jazz star Jamie Cullum who delivers a spirited keyboard arrangement of Hendrix's \\"Angel\\".  The only two disappointments are some pretty crappy singing attempts by Ronnie Wood and Amy Winehouse.  Everyone else is just fine. Hank Marvin's classy, gorgeous version of the classic \\"Sleepwalk\\" is so perfectly soothing I could listen to it for hours.<br /><br />The definite highlight for me was watching the great GARY MOORE walk out on stage and show everybody who the most criminally overlooked blues-rock guitarist in the world is!  Moore makes the most of his brief slot with a powerhouse version of \\"Red House\\" that simply blows Jimi Hendrix's recording right out of the water. Gary calmly takes the stage, greets the audience politely, and then proceeds to TEAR IT UP with an electrifying performance that only Stevie Ray Vaughan could have matched!  You can hear the crowd roar their approval during Gary's SCORCHING extended solo, and he ends the song to a well-deserved standing ovation.<br /><br />Some have asked why Eric Clapton did not show up for this concert.  I ask why Gary Moore was never invited to Clapton's Crossroads festival the same year this show was filmed???  After witnessing the overwhelming power and intensity that Gary displays here, you have to wonder if Clapton has any desire to get blown off the stage by this guy...and I say thisas a Clapton fan with no disrespect to Eric!<br /><br />If you are a guitar lover with an interest in classic rock, this DVD is a nice addition to your collection.  For Gary Moore fans, this DVD is a must-have that is easily worth the 15 bucks you will pay.
B000YABYSS|5.0|Please allow me to give a brief summary of life for African Americans, circa 1935:      *  \\"Jim Crow Laws\\" were in effect In the Southern US, requiring \\"separate but equal\\" facilities for Blacks and Whites, including schools, bathrooms, etc.  *  African Americans weren't issued birth certificates by some States, thus denying them basic rights of existence   *  African Americans were called Negroes--or worse, and treated accordingly  *  If an Afican American wanted an education beyond high school, most went to private segregated colleges    Forgive me if you already know this, but for some, this brief history lesson is all the African American history they've had and this small amount will help understand the times and the people.      \\"The Great Debaters\\" takes place at Wiley College, a private Negro college, in Marshall, TX.  The semester has just begun and it's time for tryouts for the debate team with Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington) as the coach.     Out of 45 students, only 4 make the cut.  That's two team members and two alternates.  Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams) is the only returning student.    Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) is obviously the pick of the crop.  He's so much of the same mind as Tolson, they could easily be enemies if they weren't aligned, but both men have their own demons chasing them. Samantha Booke, alternate, (Jumee Smollett), wants to be the third Negro woman to practice law in the State of Texas.  She's ambitious and she nearly lets romance with Lowe get in her way.  James Farmer, Jr., alternate, (Denzel Whitaker), is only 14 years old and being strongly pushed by his father Dr. James Farmer, Sr (Forest Whitaker, who is not related to him) to excel in his studies and not let the debate team get in his way.      Tolson's got an ambitious program started.  From the beginning, he's writing top schools, challenging them to match wits with his students.     As the team wins, more invitations come in.  Meanwhile, Tolson is privately leading an effort to form a union for the Black and White sharecroppers of the area.   Unfortunately, the local farmers disapprove and the meeting's attacked with the local Sheriff in the lead.  Tolson himself nearly goes to jail and loses one member of his team because he's got a dangerous reputation as a Communist.    \\"The Great Debaters\\" may not be completely accurate about the histories of the people it depicts, but it is an education to the times themselves.  We learn some poignant lessons about the origin of the term lynching and see an example.  We also learn about civil disobedience and what it really means--and costs--to stand up for what you believe in.      Some describe this as a 'feel good' or 'team' film and I don't dispute either of these findings, but \\"The Great Debaters\\" is also an opportunity to demonstrate the history of a time and of a people.  In my opinion, this is a very good film to show to history classes of all colors, because too few people do realize the conditions of the past and the price African American people paid for a better education and more chances to interact and compete on an equal basis.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|As a die hard \\"Kraller\\" I can only say that this CD does what it was intended to do...namely?...give an \\"across the board\\" look at what Ms. Krall is capable of doing.   My only regret is that the producers didn't include her version of \\"Dancing in the Dark\\", which, in my humble opinion, is brilliant!!!  Not only because of her superb interpretation of this old standard but also because the \\"background\\" string orchestration is GENIOUS!!!
0553583182|4.0|This book was very interesting.  It caused me to think more about what I think about, what types of perhaps self-defeating thoughts may be going through my mind, sabotaging what I truly desire.  It made me take an evaluation of my mental framework, and giving me a blueprint on ways to change.  It emphasizes driving deep into your subconscious your dreams and desires, be it health, wealth, harmony, etc. through the use of talking to your subconscious in a prayer.  It could have been summed up much quicker, because each method is the same, only with a different request, yet it made me think of the many different ways faith can and will effect me.  All in all, it was an interesting read.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|If you want to sit back, relax and listen to engineering at it's finest, this CD is for you. Not to mention it's the Beatles! George Martin and son have really done fine work on this CD and I recommend listening to it with the use of headphones. You will hear every detail.
7119005901|4.0|The historic novel of the three kingdoms was a fantastic read. The literary style was, at first, difficult to get used to but the story itself is told in a very straightforward fashion and the characters are very rich. The constant turn of events will have you rooting for the splendid victories throughout Shu-Han's campaigns and lamenting their bitter losses. I noticed many typos throughout the entire novel but they're few and they're small enough to avoid confusion as you read. Overall I think this particular translation was excellent. It was recommended to me and I would gladly recommend it to anyone who has an affinity for this great age of chivalrous heroes and tyrannous villains.
0812565886|5.0|Persuasion is an utter delight to read. This book was written almost 200 years ago but the story could just as well have been written today. It is still fresh and gives a tremendous light on the life and mannerisms of people that lived long ago - nothing much has changed i take it! Jane Austen is witty and has the tremendous ability to describe situations and relationships. She is also the master of suspense. Persuasion is a moving story that describes the human ability to patiently and agonisingly wait for happiness or love as it were. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will never forget the character of Miss Anne Elliot. A delightful read indeed.
B000002LIX|5.0|This album is a masterpiece by my fav band, Jane's Addiction. Three Days alone is worth the price of this album, it is such a well written epic that twists and turns with different emotions. Plus you get other J.A classics like Stop!, Ain't No Right, Been Caught Stealing and Classic Girl. Then She Did is another epic that is beautiful, grand and somber at the same time (actual title was Then She Died). No One's Leaving, Obvious and Of Course are good too. If you have not gotten this album yet you really should, it's an all time classic. The cover art done by Perry is great as well.
B000VR824S|5.0|Smokin DVD , quality of filming excellent, Film crew took super shots of the musicians playing there hearts out. Being a professional drummer for 40 yrs .I look for ,of course the Drummers,. And what a Line up, The Great and Fabulous Vinnie Colaiuta, with Jeff Beck and an Amazing young beautiful  girl all of maybe 14, bass player ,absolute killer. The only disappointing thing on this video is they don,t mention the names of the other players who are performing. That to me is a complete bummer, an in injustice not to give the proper mention who they are. After all the instruments they play are displayed so should they. But thats the only thing I can bitch about. Get this you won,t be dissapointed.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Look at the film's title closely. It is \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" not \\"Beowulf vs. Grendel\\" or \\"Beowulf the Warrior.\\" It should be \\"and\\" because it is a revisionist version where Grendel is not just a monster and Beowulf is a fighter who has self-doubt. In a sense the 2007 Hollywood blockbuster is more faithful to the original poem as Ray Winstone's hero never hesitates before fighting Grendel or \\"the monster.\\"    So don't expect traditional heroic tale of warriors, bloody fighting with flesh-tearing monsters. Heavily bearded Gerard Butler plays Beowulf, but his character makes a marked contrast with his King Leonidas in \\"300\\" where the good is always good, the bad is always bad and the warriors fight and kill without doubting their actions. Here Butler plays Beowulf who is caught between the two sides.    Of course, whoever wrote the original epic poem must have intended it to be read literally and the film's beautiful cinematography captures the world of the original poem. However, the filmmakers added several elements to explain the background of Grendel, who is a troll sort of misunderstood or ill-treated. I do not disagree with the idea itself, but unfortunately the idea is done in a heavy-handed fashion.     I watched this partly because it stars gifted Sarah Polley. Sarah Polley plays a \\"witch\\" who has something to tell, something Beowulf (and we) should know. I really like her, but her presence and her words look and sound too modern and somehow we are supposed to believe every word of her while it seems one character (always raving something) represents Christianity. That is too crude a way to present balanced perspectives.     I am not saying this is a terrible film. It was not just my cup of tea. Still I think the slow-moving film spends so many words (including f-words) that before we start to really think, they give us answers. Or maybe we have seen too many revisionist versions of old tales when we want them in an old-fashioned way, like the old poem where no one questions the values of fame and glory.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful chanting, well recorded and well produced. Every track transcends one into a peaceful state of consciousness.
B000WQWPJQ|2.0|This blu-ray version only has the movie, no extras.<br />What blu-ray manufacturers are thinking?  The disc suppose to have 50 Gb of space.  But they decided to only put the movie.  Plus the quality is Ok, just a little bit better than the dvd version.  What a waste of money.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and He was thrilled to get it.<br />I must say that of all the websites out there these days and the concern about idenity theif, where one has axcess to your creditcard information. I have been using Amazon for years and it is a very trusted website.
B00005JMEW|3.0|American film makers have a tendency to follow a certain career cycle. At first, they seek studio approval, so they make a couple of films to the specification of pushy producers or totally independently but on low budget. Either way, their initial successes are then followed up by the grand opus syndrome. Coppola is a case in point. So is Bertolucci. There are other boy-wonders who have fallen into the trap of believing their own hype, as have the studios who ultimately green-light whatever their favorites come up with, including ideas without story-lines. \\"Kill Bill\\" is going to please some, as it should. It is, after all, rather different, and does celebrate a certain genre that no doubt many find appealing. That said, the slaughter-house opening struck me an over-indulgent rather than artistic. Don't get me wrong. I loved \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" But this is \\"Pulp Fiction\\" without the brilliant story-telling. This is lots of effects, but no acting.  No doubt some would have it that this is exactly what the director had in mind. I'll give Tarantino credit for pulling off what he set out to make, but from my point of view the fact that the director had fun making his film is not the same thing as the audience having fun watching it.

0805079831|5.0|Shock Doctrine is packed with stacks of facts Bush does not want known. Reading this book has made me so much smarter, I'm sure my reading Shock Doctrine has landed me on the FBI's \\"watch this guy because he's too informed\\" list. Klein deserves medals.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a suberb writer.  The book offers a fascinating insight into another culture.  The characters are created with  true understanding.  The reader knows and empathizes with each character, even while disagreeing with and very well disliking some of them.  What a wonderful read!!
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Wow, this movie is terrible.  The plot, dialogue, and main characters are rife with horrible cliches.  The special effects are over the top and the action is totally unrealistic - yes, I realize this is a comic book-based movie, but come on.  Everyone is invincible until the contrived plot calls for the heroes to defeat the evil doers.  None of the characters are likable - particularly Peter Parker, who was so unbearable that I constantly was hoping for his quick and painful demise.  There's a dance scene or two which are so intolerable it defies words!  This movie is  rubbish plain and simple.
B00005OM4K|4.0|This set contains all of the CCR albums plus prelude and live material.  As such it contains some of CCRs lesser moments as well as all the great hits. Thankfully the lesser moments were few and far between so what you have here is a (mostly) superb overview of a great band.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie is really good. Several other reviewers are unfairly comparing it to the the 1971 Gene Wilder version, \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\\" The Johnny Depp version is actually much closer to the children's book written by Roald Dahl. In fact, Roald Dahl completely hated the Gene Wilder version because the film makers changed everything in his book. One reviewer says that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka was scary and wierd. Well, if you've read the book, you'll know that Willy Wonka is supposed to be scary and wierd.<br /><br />Brandon Simpson,<br />[...]
0060566108|4.0|Briefly, Although this book was written some years back;yet it is still strongly valid and valuable for today's business cases.
0439882826|5.0|We got this for my 7 1/2 year-old son for Christmas and he loves it!  He is a Stars Wars fan and loves to read all about it.  I would suggest this for ages 7 or older, he is careful and knows that it is fragile.  My husband loves the book too and they both will have a lot of fun time looking and reading it.  Love the light up light sabers too!
B00081U7HC|4.0|I love this movie, but I am disappointed that there are all these scenes in the DVD that were not in the original movie.  The scenes are not added features -- they are just part of the movie, so you can't wathc the movie without them.  The additional scenes are OK, but they add little to the great original movie.  There's a reason why those scenes were cut in the first place!
B000PTYPAC|4.0|there is some very good songs on this album that i can never get bored of, but the other songs you just i skip because they aren't  memorable and like a million other songs. thats really my only complaint.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|I bought this movie on blu-ray just to hear the high quality sound track.  The DTS-HD Master Audio sound is warm and rich and makes the movie so much more enjoyable than the relatively low quality dolby digital sound track found on the regular DVD.<br /><br />If you're going to watch this, watch it with good sound- it is a musical after all!!!
B000VI70WM|5.0|They say that this album is a tribute to their old dance roots.  First listen it doesn't sound like Duran Duran but it grows on you.  It's one of my favorite CDs now.  I could do without Justin Timberlake and timbaland, but DD was always mainstream... Definitely worth it even for the diehard DD fan.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The season finale was so good that I couldn't sleep that night.  I just laid in bed thinking about all of the surprises and twists.  An amazing series that I highly recommend.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I love it. The story to it is good and the acting is equally good. The special effects and cinematography rock too. You want a good action film this is one of the good ones. I don't bother with the sequels though, for they are not good in my opinion.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Seaon three of Lost did not have a great start, and Palo and Nikki did not help. However, the last handful of episodes pulled out all of the stops and brought Lost back to form. The extras on this set are great. I always enjoy watching deleted scenes and bloopers.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I was very pleased on how fast this product was shipped. And how easy it wss to find. Thank you for your help. I will continue to shop here. Also, my son was very happy in recieving it .
B00005MP58|3.0|This is slow comparing to other versions of Pride & Prejudice, but it's still a good romance movie.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a fantastic addition to a D40/D40x.  The unit is lightweight and is very simple to operate.  If you want to keep the ISO down indoors and prevent unsightly wash-outs and red-eyes that come with using a direct flash, this flash really works well when bounced off a ceiling.  The only thing that keeps my rating from being 5 stars is the lack of a built-in diffuser.  I have read it is easy to make one, but it sure would be convenient to be able to flip down a diffuser for a few quick close photos in a room with a 15' ceiling.      Battery life and recovery time is excellent (using rechargeable batteries).
0440238609|5.0|You will find that these books provide a fast paced journey with fantastic creatures, characters and plot development. There is a good flow to the writing and it will keep you turning pages whether you're 15 or 25. The polarization of reviews to be found are religious in backing. You won't find a one star rating from someone based on the story or the prose, but on their distaste for any themes they find against their own dogma. The story does attack tyranny and religious domination. A snippet from the book: \\"I met an angel: a female angel.. She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\" Its really a sum of that; independence and critical thought over suppression, dogma and dominion.<br /><br />Lyra and Will are the two heroes of the series. Each has an instrument that provides them some fantastic power. The books are filled with parallel worlds and various other entities borrowed from theoretical physics. If you are looking for science fiction and fantasy mixed stories in marvelous settings with plots to keep you jumping, this is a good bet.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|The thing about a musical is that if you don't like the music, it really sucks. Fortunately, I knew I loved the theme because I copied it from Donald's iPod. It's just so haunting, isn't it? How about the movie? Let's watch.<br /><br />It's a Joel Schumacher film. Hey, didn't he kill the Batman franchise? I asked Google. Yep. That's because he was supposed to be making this movie, not those movies. It's just so atmospheric, and the acting is secondary to the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and to the scenery. His style and this movie are a perfect fit.<br /><br />I do want to warn you that, if you go out and get this, the first music after the theme is supposed to be bad, so don't give up on me yet.<br /><br />We have a love triangle, petty intrigues, manipulative people, over-the-top humor, shades of AMADEUS, some chuckles at the lyrics when they get playful, spooky chilling stuff that literally gave me goosebumps. The original novel was obviously powerful, and nothing's been lost in translation here. Since about 90% of the dialogue is sung, it's a good thing I love the music. A love scene or two seems painfully long because it's sung, but that's okay. If I can be patient, so can you.<br /><br />As for the plot, everything you already know about it happens quickly, so it's no plot spoiler to say the hideous guy in the mask is in love with the lovely lady and does something about it. My life, actually. I'm pretty hideous, and Jan's a beauty. Except that in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, I believe we all want ugly to win.<br /><br />And then the second of my two VCDs didn't work. Damn! I read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia after that. Schumaker wasn't 100% true to it, but I don't mind. I've got a feel for what it's about now, even though I'm sure I missed the best part. Now I can enjoy my MP3s even more. And if I stumble upon the DVD or VCDs in a store, I'll pick it up just to see how Schumacher's version ends. It's a rental I strongly recommend to you.
0375842381|5.0|You will find that these books provide a fast paced journey with fantastic creatures, characters and plot development. There is a good flow to the writing and it will keep you turning pages whether you're 15 or 25. The polarization of reviews to be found are religious in backing. You won't find a one star rating from someone based on the story or the prose, but on their distaste for any themes they find against their own dogma. The story does attack tyranny and religious domination. A snippet from the book: \\"I met an angel: a female angel.. She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\" Its really a sum of that; independence and critical thought over suppression, dogma and dominion.<br /><br />Lyra and Will are the two heroes of the series. Each has an instrument that provides them some fantastic power. The books are filled with parallel worlds and various other entities borrowed from theoretical physics. If you are looking for science fiction and fantasy mixed stories in marvelous settings with plots to keep you jumping, this is a good bet.

B00005JLEU|5.0|All of the movies by this director are wonderfully imaginative. Spirited Away was our first introduction to studio ghibli and since then we've watched (and eventually bought) almost all of the titles available in English. Some of this movie may be a bit scary for very young or sensitive children, but with parents to explain what's happening and to remind that it's pretend, it should be fine.

B000W4KT64|4.0|This version of \\"Hairspray\\" is a pleasant enough diversion but it doesn't hold a candle to John Waters' original version from 1988.  Waters, with a lower budget, was able to deliver high octane entertainment on a grander scale.  What this flick lacks is any coherent style from director Adam Shankman.  It seems to be a paint-by-numbers affair that barely rises above the mundane.  What's also glaring is Shankman bludgeons the film's anti-segregation message to the point of noxious preachiness.  Waters was able to get the point across in the original with more subtlety.  Imagine that:  John Waters accused of subtlety.  The songs are generally good but are no match for the r'n'b chestnuts that Waters scored his film with.  What elevates the film is the highly energetic turns by the cast assembled here.  John Travolta, as Edna Turnblad, makes the character his own and makes you almost forget Divine's superb turn in the original.  I smell at least Oscar nomination here.  Though Christopher Walken has limited screen time he makes the most of it particularly in a number performed with Travolta.  Michelle Pfeiffer drips malevolence as the whitebread TV station manager.  Nikki Blonsky is a revelation who opens the film on a promisingly energetic note with her rendition of \\"Good Morning, Baltimore\\".  Not bad but not all it could have been.

1563890119|4.0|I didn't really care for the artwork in Sandman, but the story was phenominal once you get past the first couple issues. Especially the issue where Morpheus goes to Hell. That alone is worth the price paid for the entire first volume. I really look forward to reading the rest of The Sandman.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Warner Bros. has doena great job on transferring an older movie to Blu Ray, the ultimate in HD technology. The video was great considering its age, far better then the DVD version I once owned. For those interested, I watched the film thru my PS3 connected by a HDMI to DVI cord, and thru a Toslink optical audio output to a Pionner 660W 6.1/7.1 receiver on a Hitachi 42\\" 1080i plasma. Hopefully, Warner Bros. will make a smart move and become Blu Ray only, ending this drawn out and pointless format war where only the consumers are hurting.

0374105235|3.0|I enjoyed the book, and I have no doubt Ishmael Beah had to serve in the army as just a boy and witnessed the horrors of war, but some points of the book just struck me as very unlikely to have occurred.  One example was the fight in the rehabilitation center, which included not just knives but a GRENADE, which left 6 boys dead.  I just wonder whether everything happened 100% as he describes it or whether there wasn't some artistic license involved.  I hate to say it but in this day and age, you can't necessarily take a person at their word...did the publisher fact check where possible to make sure this is the unadulterated truth?
B000TUXL2A|4.0|It is a typical Mark Knopfler album and the best music for my christmas  holydays.   Handwerklich gediegene Songs in altbewährter Mark Knopfler Soundstruktur, eher etwas ruhiger angelegt wie auch schon seine Vorläuferalben. Gegen Schluß hin werden die Songs noch stärker und man möchte fast sagen: so nun noch weiter !  Insgesamt ein prima Album zum Entspannen.
B000I2J2XQ|4.0|The Harry Potter series is made for the HD DVD format. Although not as audio intense as Transformers or Star Wars, the aural impact of this movie was impressive nonetheless. Any Move with TrueHD that takes advantage of it gets points in my book!<br /><br />I am not going to go into plot, because if you dont know what the Harry Potter series is about, you probably have been living in a cabin writing your manifesto in squirrel blood on toilet paper. Just understand that any movie where kids are casting spells, riding broomsticks and fighting three-headed dogs, the audio better be up to the task, like this HD DVD.<br /><br />The Picture was more than aceptable. Like King Kong, however, some of the CGI special effects were apparent at the high HD DVD resolution. Unfortunately this HD DVD lacks the wow factor of a helicoptor tuning into a robot or Megan Fox bending over a Camaro.<br /><br />The extra features on the first disc are astounding. You get about 7 deleted scenes in HD, background information into production - which is usually available on SD DVDs. The difference here is that it appears the studio tried to fill the disc with as much data as possible. If you like Harry Potter you will love how much deeper this HD DVD takes you.
B000NTPDK0|5.0|Although the theme, the actors, and the videography was well done, no one will know how this blu ray movie in our home was just like being in the theatre including the stereo sound.

B000XUUQQK|3.0|I was actually surprised at how much fun I had watching this flick. Some of these direct to dvd time killers are better than what's being thrown at us in the theaters. I'm still struggling with trying to watch the first bore-fest but this little gem got me hooked right away. This is a straight up slasher with some supernatural flavor used more as a decoy than for major thrills. If you like these films then get yourself a copy and you will definitely enjoy yourself. They spent less money this time but the addition of Tobin Bell (Today's Vincent Price) is perfect. I recommend this one for fans of the slasher genre, Mr. Bell, and cheesy little dvds. Check Tobin out in Buried Alive also.
1400079276|4.0|I am a prodigious reader of literary fiction, yet \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" is the first that I've read so far by Haruki Murakami. He is widely popular (particularly among the young) all over the world. He has won numerous literary awards including the Gunzo New Writer Award (1979), the Noma Literary Award (1982), the Junichiro Tanizaki Prize (1985), the Yomiuri Literary Award (1996), the Kuwabara Takeo Award (1999), the Franz Kafka Prize (2006), the World Fantasy Award (2006), and the Kiriyama Prize for fiction from the Pacific Rim (2007). His fan base is worldwide and legion--most are rooting for him to win the Nobel Prize sometime soon. So, I thought it was high time that I read one of his novels. I am glad that I did.<br /><br />I found \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" intellectually intriguing and compulsively readable--overall, a stunning surreal Cirque-du-Soleil kind of literary experience. When I finished the book, I was intellectually stimulated and exhausted. I was also a tad bit let down by an ending that did not seem to measure up to the magnitude of the whole. But most of all, I was powerfully confused. I am the type of reader who loves to uncover thematic meaning within works of literary fiction, but this book had me stumped.<br /><br />The book is a surreal coming-of-age tale. There is an eclectic mix of genres, including sci-fi, fantasy, psychological, detective, erotica, mystery, thriller, spirit quest, and romance--they're all here--and the scaffolding that holds the plot together is nothing less than a postmodern Oedipal myth! It's positively brilliant, deliciously bizarre, and enjoyably brazen.<br /><br />The more I struggled with uncovering the thematic meanings hidden in the whole, the more it became obvious that enjoying the journey thorough the story is far more important than deciphering whatever themes and riddles may be there. Nonetheless, I persisted, trying desperately to piece together a set of coherent symbolic themes. Yet every time I thought I was onto something, the interlocking concepts fell apart in the details. It was a pleasurable mental exercise, nonetheless.<br /><br />Personally, I found the book intellectually profound mostly because of the small bits and pieces of stimulating intellectual dialogue and description that pop up routinely throughout the book--discussions of philosophy, symbolism, metaphysical systems, modern culture, musicology, etc. These make the reading complex and fascinating, and contribute to making the surreal appear real.<br /><br />As an academic research librarian, I was challenged to try to find what interpretive spin others had placed on this novel. So I did my research as thoroughly as I could, given the time and resources I had at my disposal. There are countless reviews, on blogs, in academic reference sources, and in newspapers worldwide. There are also numerous interviews with the author about this work and others. I have digital access to all these resources and have spent many more hours than I would like to admit combing through them trying to find whatever there was that might shed light on what the author meant to convey with this work.<br /><br />In the end, I actually found precious little in terms of a cohesive thematic unraveling of the meaning behind the text! What I did find that seemed significant, were various interviews with the author where he shares with us how he writes, what themes he is trying to convey when he writes, and what he was trying to do with this book in particular. Here are some of the most relevant quotations I found from these interviews.<br /><br />1) SOURCE. \\"Author's Q and A\\" for \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" posted on the Murakami's Random House Website.<br /><br />QUOTE. Murakami writes: \\"'Kafka on the Shore' contains several riddles, but there aren't any solutions provided. Instead, several of these riddles combine, and through their interaction the possibility of a solution takes shape. And the form this solution takes will be different foreach reader. To put it another way, the riddles function as part of the solution. It's hard to explain, but that's the kind of novel I set out to write.\\"<br /><br />2) SOURCE. Interview with Murakami in the \\"Irish Times\\" (May 17, 2003, p. 60).<br /><br />QUOTE:  The interviewer writes: \\"Murakami writes as if in a dream. Not a sleeping dream--he is no richer in night dreams than anyone else, he says--but a waking dream, one he can control. And he demonstrates--hands outstretched, fingers moving on an imaginary keyboard, eyes drooped. 'And dreaming like this, this is fiction,' he says. 'It is exciting. I don't do any planning when I start to write. I just begin and follow my dream.'\\"<br /><br />Further on, Murakami says: \\"Young people today are so helpless. The world they are in is so controlled it's not easy for them to find a way out. They are very thirsty and they absorb anything, naturally and eagerly. And stories, if they are good, they offer a way out. Not in reality perhaps, but in their heads, and that's a help. In that inner-space world you can find a special place for yourself. My books offer a sense of freedom from the real world.\\"<br /><br />Later in the same interview, Murakami says: \\"I believe the purpose of writing a novel is to write in a very simple, neutral prose and to write a very complex, deep story...Some writers do the reverse. They are using very complex language to make up a very simple--I would even say shallow--story. And I don't think that's right.\\"<br /><br />3) SOURCE. Interview with Murakami in the \\"Paris Review\\" (Summer 2004, Issue 170, p. 115-151).<br /><br />QUOTE. Murakami says: \\"We are living in a fake world; we are watching fake evening news. We are fighting a fake war. Our government is fake. But we find reality in this fake world. So our stories are the same: we are walking through fake scenes, but ourselves, as we walk through these scenes, are real. The situation is real, in the sense that it's a commitment; it's a true relationship. That's what I want to write about.\\"<br /><br />4) SOURCE. Interview with Murakami in the \\"The Times\\" (London, Jan 22, 2005, p. 36).<br /><br />QUOTE. Murakami says: \\"In this age, you don't know who is a friend and who is a foe--terrorism is just one example...They could be anywhere, any time, in any form. It's a more postmodern world than the Cold War era, but that's the reality whether we like it or not. Honestly speaking, this world is getting closer and closer to the world of my fiction-- more chaotic, more surrealistic and risky.\\"<br /><br />Further on, the interviewer comments: \\"As the Sixties became the Seventies, the student avant-gardists were transformed into obedient salarymen. 'We said that we could change the world, but nothing has changed,' he (Murakami) has said. 'The world has changed us.'\\"<br /><br />Later in the same interview, Murakami says: \\"I want to be optimistic, but as a writer I tend to be pessimistic. If you don't believe something, you're nothing as a person or a writer. I want to see the good side of society but I know that sometimes it doesn't turn out that way. I guess I write about bad things in my stories, I write worst-case scenarios. Fiction is just like a dream. You have nightmares--worst-case scenarios of your mind--and they release possibilities. I try to keep dark sides in my stories--it helps to keep the balance in actual life.\\"<br /><br />Further on, Murakami says: \\"When I was young I thought I could write anywhere, I wanted to be free. But as I got older I realized that I can't be free. No one can be free.\\"<br /><br />5) SOURCE. Interview with Murakami in \\"The New York Times\\" (New York, Oct 15, 2001, p. E1).<br /><br />QUOTE. Murakami says: \\"What I write are stories in which the hero is looking for the right way in this world of chaos. That is my theme. At the same time I think there is another world that is underground. You can access this inner world in your mind. Most protagonists in my books live in both worlds--this realistic world and the underground world. If you are trained you can find the passage and come and go between the two worlds. It is easy to find an entrance into this closed circuit, but it is not easy to find an exit.\\"<br /><br />Later Murakami says: \\"In Japan most people think that terrorism is the United States' own problem. The U.S. is the strongest country in the world and Islamic people don't like America, therefore there is a terrorism problem. But that isn't right. The same thing can happen at any moment, in Tokyo, Berlin or Paris, because this is war between closed and open circuits, different states of minds. This is not about nations or countries, and not about religion, but about states of mind.\\"<br /><br />6) SOURCE. Interview with Murakami in the European \\"Wall Street Journal\\" (Brussels, Dec 11, 2006, p. 12).<br /><br />QUOTE. The interviewer writes: \\"The protagonist in 'Kafka on the Shore' is uneasily semiconscious of a murder he may have committed in the past. Themes of history and memory clearly run through Mr. Murakami's books. Yet he seems loath to analyze his own work for political messages or historical lessons, saying that he just wants to 'write a story.' Sending overt political messages is simply not the job of a fiction writer, he says. That's not to say that Mr. Murakami's colorful prose doesn't address serious issues. It just does so in an indirect way--which, in Mr. Murakami's view, may be even more effective. 'If you say, \\"I'm very sad, my dog died,\\" it's a message--a statement. Nobody sympathizes with you,' he explains. 'In that case, you have to change your statement into another kind of story. When you're sad, when you lost your dog, you should not write about your dog. You should write about another thing. If you write about the dog, it's an essay, not fiction.'\\"<br /><br />I hope these quotes prove helpful as you think about \\"Kafka on the Shore.\\" They were helpful to me...in the end, they helped me to stop trying to find answers to the riddles.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|A movie for the entire family. Fast pace entertainment with musical classics. Carrol Burnet is marvolous as usual and so is the entire cast. I have the newer version but I enjoy this version more (so does my granddaughter) It has more songs with entertaining scenes so as not to be the boring stand still slow motion. Very well made, I'm glad I bought it and would bye it again just to have a spare.
B000XPU5NY|1.0|Just listened to this on Napster and could not sit through one song in its entirety.  The key changes ruin the songs, and they sound slow and lethargic.  I saw these guys play at that Live Earth gig on TV and they looked so bored.  I'm glad I passed up the chance to see them on this tour - I saw them many many times in the 80's (too late for the PG/SH era), and they were awesome then.  Do yourself a favor and see the Musical Box in concert for a true representation of how great Genesis was.  My guess is that this will be a good keepsake for all that saw them on the tour.  Even Robert Plant could sing most of the Zep tunes in their original keys.

093183841X|5.0|Although ostensively a price guide to cameras and other photo-related equipment \\"McKeown's\\" is much more.  Over the years this volume has grown to encyclopedic proportions as it updates and adds to its huge inventory.  In fact, I find the price quotes to be the least important of its features.  Here in one giant volume we get a vast array of great illustrations, camera histories, and specifications.  This is the kind of volume that won't let go once a photography enthusiast flips through its pages. Pretty soon he/she will jump to another section, as each entry induces one to look up something else. As the \\"Guide\\" takes pains to suggest, prices quoted here are not carved in stone, and various factors ultimately determine the price one pays for such photographic treasures.  I only hope the publishers will avoid the temptation of printing future releases in color, as the black and whites add to the antique \\"feel\\" of the book. Though a bit pricey, it's undeniable how much work goes into producing this comprehensive book, and for all the pleasures that this book delivers the price is well worth it!
0440418569|5.0|The final book in the _Dark Materials_ trilogy is bittersweet.  There are no loose ends as plot points, characters and clues are tied together, although things don't end quite the way I had expected (or wanted) them to.  I hesitate to go into further explaination for fear of spoiling the story; suffice it to say that readers will not be disappointed with the way the trilogy is concluded.  What struck me most was the number of allusions to literature in this book - many more than the previous two in the series.<br /><br />The most obvilious similarity is with Milton's _Paradise Lost_: the idea of a menachean battle between angels is not new - that Pullman is criticised with claims of an anti-Christian bias seems to demonstrates an ignorance of this fact.  Yet the allusions do not end with Milton.  I found connections with Homer (as Lyra journeys to the Land of the Dead), with Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_, even with Dante.  While Pullman is no Dante (or Milton, for that matter), I was impressed with his retelling of these stories and of his new take on an old theme.<br /><br />Much of these connections, of course, will be lost on younger readers - this is fine, as it is very well told with plenty of action and suspense to keep younger readers interested.  For those with broader experience, the connections will surely not be missed.  Regardless of whether there is an agenda in the stories, they are imaginitive and captivating.  Highly recommended.
006085880X|3.0|[[ASIN:0061150142 The Pact: A Love Story]]    I did enjoy the book and recommend it but want to warn the reader that it is not a happy ending and they will probably be haunted by the characters for several days at least.  I was disturbed by this story on several levels.  First, it is not love if you are pressuring the girl to have sex. (SPOILER) Second, Emily never tells anyone she was molested and the molester gets away with it. The main thing that disturbed me however was the ending. I wanted the families to be friends again or for Chris to find out about the creep who molested her.  I found it a bit unbelievable that Chris would have kept quiet about her desire to commit suicide.  If he truly loved her he would have told. It was just so very sad.  I literally bawled.  It took a week and a very light weight book with a  happy ending to get my mind off of Chris and Emily.  Good writing, but you might need a prescription for Prozac to get over the depressing ending.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|If you don't own any discs by Led Zeppelin and are thinking about picking one up, this should be the one you buy.  It has all their great hits on it.  That's two solid discs of blow-the-roof-off-the-dump rock.    This was a Christmas gift for me, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it also includes a dvd, which contains about two hours of concert footage.  I was never lucky enough to see these guys in concert, so the dvd was a big treat for me.    My only complaint about the disc is the packaging.  It's one of those cases where the discs are enclosed in the cardboard case and you have to pull them out.  I have three problems with these cases.  First, it's hard to get the disc in and out, without getting fingerprints on the disc.  Second, the sliding in and out is going to scratch the discs.  Thirds, after you have these for a while the cases get a bit loose and there's danger of having the disc come out too easily.  Other than that, it's a great collection and one that any fan of Led Zeppelin will enjoy.

B000FBFMIO|5.0|Originally posted at Fantasy Literature<br /><br />“Alone again. It isn’t fair. Truly it isn’t. You’ve the saddest song of any man I’ve ever known.”  ~Starling Birdsong, minstrel to Queen Kettricken<br />I squealed with delight when I recently opened a box from Brilliance Audio and found a review copy of Fool’s Errand inside. This is an old favorite that, for years, I had planned to re-read. Since Hobb’s new book comes out next week, this seemed like the perfect time to get back into FitzChivalry Farseer’s world.<br /><br />We first met Fitz back in Assassin’s Apprentice when he was a boy. As bastard son to a Farseer prince, he was brought to court and trained as the king’s assassin. He inherited the Skill, the magic that the Farseer family uses to communicate telepathically, from his father. Unfortunately, he inherited the Wit, the maligned “beast magic,” from his mother. He has had to hide this magic, and his wit-bond with his wolf Nighteyes, from others. Folks in the Six Duchies are suspicious of Wit users and often burn them at the stake. The next two FARSEER books, Royal Assassin and Assassin’s Quest, follow Fitz as he grows up, learns to use and control his powers, falls in love, and does the ugly duties that are required of the king’s assassin. By the end, Fitz has served the Farseers well, but he’s lost just about everything in the process.<br /><br />I remember how devastated I was, years ago, when things didn’t turn out well for Fitz. A few days later I found out that Fitz’s story wasn’t over. As soon I realized that it continued in Fool’s Errand, the first book in the TAWNY MAN trilogy, I immediately sent my husband to Barnes & Noble. (I had the flu that day.) I don’t think I was ever so happy to get my hands on a particular book, and I felt that way again when the audio version showed up unexpectedly at my door a couple of weeks ago. D&eacute;j&agrave; vu!<br /><br />And so Fitz’s story continues. For the first half of Fool’s Errand, we see Fitz and Nighteyes in their little home in the wilderness. Fitz is 35 years old and he’s been away from court for fifteen years. Almost everyone, including the woman Fitz loves, thinks he’s dead. Occasionally Fitz gets a visit from someone at court who urges him to come back. He is a Farseer, after all. Finally, Fitz is convinced to return when Prince Dutiful goes missing and the Witted Piebalds are suspected of being involved. (You can read the Piebald origin story in Hobb’s recent novella, The Willful Princess and the Piebald Prince.) Fitz’s partner on his quest to find Dutiful is his best friend, The Fool, who he hasn’t seen in years.<br /><br />The brilliance of the FARSEER stories is that Fitz feels so real and evokes such sympathy due to his circumstances that I am content just to be around him, even if he’s doing nothing more exciting than feeding the chickens or fixing the roof. I just want Fitz to be happy and content and to find a place where he belongs. I suppose I might get bored if Fitz fed chickens for 700 pages, so at just the right time Hobb takes him away from his cozy little home and he goes off to have an adventure. First we get to revisit Buckkeep, where Fitz grew up. Then he’s off to find Prince Dutiful. His quest is dangerous and he uncovers a plot that is sure to result in a major political upheaval. In the end, Fitz loses out again and it’s clear that his old comfortable life with Nighteyes is over. It’s devastating. And now we have another boy to worry about: Prince Dutiful. In many ways his situation is similar to Fitz’s.<br /><br />This is the series I recommend first to anyone who asks me what they should read. But if you don’t want to get involved, I won’t blame you. FitzChivalry Farseer’s life is one of the most bittersweet (emphasis on “bitter”) stories in epic fantasy. He struggles with his identity as an orphaned bastard. Now that he’s an adult, he knows the importanceof having a father, yet he has sired two children who he can’t be a father to. He has been bullied from all sides and has been hated and mistrusted because of the Wit. He has been overworked nearly to death by the people who should love him most. He deals with addiction and difficult moral choices. He loses so much. In the entire world there are only a couple of people and one wolf who truly understand and love Fitz. That makes these few relationships so powerful, which is part of the beauty of his story.<br /><br />James Langton narrates Brilliance Audio’s version which is 25 hours long. I loved his voices for all the characters and I’m looking forward to re-reading the next book, Golden Fool, in this format. I really hope it arrives soon.father, yet he has sired two children who he can’t be a father to. He has been bullied from all sides and has been hated and mistrusted because of the Wit.

0553582461|5.0|Originally posted at Fantasy Literature.<br /><br />I shouldn't even have to write this review. Fool's Fate is the last book in Robin Hobb's TAWNY MAN trilogy, following Fool's Errand and Golden Fool. If you haven't read those (and preferably also the earlier FARSEER trilogy), you have no business reading this review. If you have read those books, there is about a 0.00416% chance that you're not going to pick up Fool's Fate, so it doesn't matter what I say here.<br /><br />But, since you are here, for whatever reason, I'll make it short and just let you know that Fool's Fate met, and maybe even exceeded, my very high expectations... which I knew it would because I read it ten years ago and have thought about it longingly in all the years since. This time I listened to Brilliance Audio's recently released audio version which was superbly narrated by James Langton who is now, for me, the official voice of FitzChivalry Farseer. I absolutely adored his performance.<br /><br />The story begins just where it left off in Golden Fool. Fitz is back at court, acting as Skillmaster and somewhat of a father figure for Prince Dutiful. The prince has gotten himself in a sticky situation -- he impulsively accepted his fianc&eacute;e's challenge to behead a giant dragon entrapped in a glacier. Not quite believing that such a thing actually exists, he sets off with his retinue (including Fitz) to do the deed. Fitz is concerned about what they'll find when they arrive because the Fool seems to think that this event is the culmination of his life's work and that his death is imminent.<br /><br />That plot summary (and even the title of the book) makes it sound like Fool's Fate is just another silly fantasy quest, but the quest, though it is integrally tied in with Hobb's other work in LIVESHIP TRADERS and THE RAIN WILD CHRONICLES is mostly a vehicle for Hobb to give us both an epic tragedy and an epic love story. That's what she's so good at -- giving us characters who we care deeply about. These people feel almost like family and we're with them as they navigate the entire spectrum of human experiences. Each of Hobb's protagonists goes through much pain, sorrow, and defeat, but each of them loves deeply and the pain makes that love even more beautiful. The story is powerfully emotional and few readers will come away with dry eyes.<br /><br />As I've said in previous reviews, the FARSEER and TAWNY MAN trilogies are, in my opinion, the best that fantasy literature has to offer and my first recommendation for friends who ask me what they should read. Though I've read thousands of fantasy novels, these remain my favorites.<br />It surprised me this year when Robin Hobb gave us Fool's Assassin, the first in a new trilogy about Fitz and the Fool.

0553582453|5.0|Originally posted at Fantasy Literature:<br /><br />Robin Hobb's TAWNY MAN trilogy, and the FARSEER trilogy that precedes them, are some of the finest epic fantasies ever written. FitzChivarly Farseer is probably my favorite character in all of fantasy literature and he's at his best in the TAWNY MAN books. Golden Fool, the middle book in the trilogy, is nearly a perfect novel, and so is its successor, Fool's Fate. I re-read Golden Fool last week because it's just been released in audio format by Brilliance Audio (superbly narrated by James Langton) and I wanted to re-visit the series before reading Hobb's newest book, Fool's Assassin. Though I've read over a thousand fantasy novels since I first read Golden Fool, the book was just as superior as I remembered.<br /><br />[Please stop here if you have not read the previous book, Fool's Errand. Spoilers will follow.]<br /><br />Once again, Fitz has been ridden hard and put away wet. When we caught up with him in the previous book, Fool's Errand, he and his wolf Nighteyes had retired from royal service and were living quietly and anonymously in a rural cabin. Then they were called out of retirement and asked to find Prince Dutiful who had been kidnapped by the Piebalds, a group of Witted folks who know the prince carries the dreaded beast magic and are trying to blackmail the queen into giving in to their demands. Fitz, accompanied by his best friend, the Fool, managed to save Prince Dutiful, but Nighteyes was killed in the process.<br /><br />Now Fitz, who is trying to deal with the overwhelming grief of losing his Wit-bonded partner, is back in Buckkeep because he's the only person who can teach Prince Dutiful how to manage the Wit and the Skill. Dutiful begins seeing Fitz as a father figure (and in some ways this is very appropriate). Fitz has always had Daddy issues and now he must be a father to both Dutiful and to Hap, the young man who he has been fostering for years and who is now ready to begin an apprenticeship. The boys are so dissimilar and offer different types of parenting challenges. Fitz is also aware that his daughter Nettle, who doesn't know he's her father, is beginning to use the Skill magic, too. Fitz has to navigate these (and several other) relationships carefully while he deals with all the current court intrigues -- a marriage alliance with a former enemy, a trading alliance with the Bingtown Traders, a possible war with Chalced, and the local problems with the Piebald rebels... all while pretending to be someone other than FitzChivalry Farseer, the hated Witted bastard who was supposed to have died in Prince Regal's dungeons. But Fitz learned long ago that serving the Farseers means that he can never have a life for himself.<br /><br />As I said, Golden Fool is nearly a perfect novel. The characters, most of whom we know from the previous FARSEER trilogy, are fully developed, easily distinguished, and impossible not to care for. The plot is nicely paced with plenty of action but also plenty of the quaint restful moments that Robin Hobb is so good at. A small amount of delightful humor is present in the scenes in which Fitz talks to a cat (Hobb is so good at portraying cats) or interacts with Thick, a mentally-challenged man who has a powerful connection to the Skill. The best part is, as usual, Hobb's way of describing Fitz's thoughts and feelings as he considers his life, his duties, his successes and failures, the people and animals he's loved, and all that he's lost. I'm not ashamed to admit that I burst into tears more than once.<br /><br />Golden Fool can't stand alone. You really must read the first three FARSEER books (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin, and Assassin's Quest) and then the first TAWNY MAN book, Fool's Errand. Fans who haven't yet read the LIVESHIP TRADERS trilogy will be fine, but there are some references to some of its characters so if you plan to read LIVESHIP TRADERS (and I highly recommend the series), it would be best to read them between FARSEER and TAWNY MAN, which is the actual publication order.<br /><br />At the end of Golden Fool, we're left with some intriguing questions about the connection between this story and that of the LIVESHIP TRADERS trilogy. We also must wonder why Prince Dutiful's fianc&eacute; has demanded that Dutiful prove his love for her by going on an impossible quest. One thing you probably won't be wondering, though, is who will be accompanying Dutiful on that quest in the next book, Fool's Fate.... I'll give you two guesses...the actual publication order.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have the unfortunate privilege of having paid $119.95 for this set several years ago, and see the price being on one-third that. Be that as it may, I remain very glad to have this set of 5 DVDs.    Whether this is \\"the definitive history of the second world war\\" as tauted on the box, is open for discussion, but make no mistake that for anyone interested in World War II, these DVDs are a must.    This collection not only draws on a wide amount of material, but includes many primary interviews with people such as: Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, Karl Wolff, SS General and Hitler's adjutant, Marquis Kido, Emperor Hirohito's chief advisory, Heinz Linge, Hitler's valet, Mitsuo Fuchida, leader of the Pearl Harbor attack, James Stewart, film actor and U.S. pilot, recently deceased Paul Tibbets of the Enola Gay, etc., etc., and etc. And while most of these people are deceased, their words and thoughts live on in this magnificent production from the 1970's brought up-to-date and re-released.    I have viewed these discs several times and still value them. Cannot stress their importance enough for anyone interested in an in depth view and review of the Second World War.    Semper Fi.
B00005JPTI|5.0|My standard for judging \\"I Am Legend\\" is not the [[ASIN:0765357151 original novel]] by Richard Matheson but \\"[[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]].\\"  I watched the 1971 adaptation starring Charlton Heston last month in anticipation of going to see this new version, a master plan thwarted by classes not ending until December 21st this year.  I also tried to avoid hearing what other thought about this movie, but I did hear whispers about how the premise was great but that audiences were disappointed by the ending.  This might be an inevitable complaint about this story because after establishing the whole idea of being the last man on earth (a point hammered home in the omnipresent trailers for the film), the movie has to deal with the fact the hero is not the last man on Earth, albeit the last one living on the island of Manhattan.  If you think about what Will Smith's Robert Neville life has been like for the last three years, then what happens in this film represents a series of significant changes cascading through the end credits.<br /><br />I think \\"I Am Legend\\" is way better than \\"Omega Man,\\" which is why its rating ends up being two stars better.  Director Francis Lawrence (\\"[[ASIN:B0009MDPYM Constantine]]\\") has the advantage of the stunning transformation of New York City into a true urban jungle, while the screenplay by Mark Protosevich (\\"[[ASIN:B00003CXKM The Cell]]\\") and Akiva Goldsman (\\"[[ASIN:B00005JN0T I, Robot]]\\") constructs a mixture of set pieces (e.g., Neville deer hunting), simple moments (e.g., Neville picking up a video), and flashbacks to the last time Neville say his wife and daughter.  The irony that a cure for cancer could turn into a plague that decimates the Earth is palatable (never trust a virus), and this time around Neville is a virologist, so he is still searching for a cure three years later.  The best parts of Smith's performance are done in silence; this might be a science fiction film but his work here is solid.  I also like the way things play out in the end, both in terms of the harsh reality of Neville's tenuous situation and also with regards to the psychology of the character that motivates his words and deeds during the end game.<br /><br />There is no attempt to explain every thing that Neville is doing, which makes sense given that unless he is dictating a report in his lab the only other living thing he could talk to is his German shepherd Sam, and the need to explain everything to Sam passed long ago.  The plethora of zombie films in recent years, especially those that have decided zombies no longer lumber around but constantly sprint (to wit, \\"[[ASIN:B00008G8L9 Day of the Dead]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000TJBN8K 28 Weeks Later\\"/\\"28 Days Later]]\\") might be misleading viewers into thinking the monsters in this one are zombie-like, but the specific evidence supplied in the film clearly indicates they are vampire-like.  One of the neat things I know about Matheson's novel was that he came up with scientific explanations for the key tenants of vampire lore, and I do wish those parts of the movie had been more explicit, but at least the film is consistent in leaving it to the audience to figure things out.<br /><br />I have yet to see \\"[[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]],\\" so it would be premature to say that \\"I Am Legend\\" is the best version of Matheson's novel, but the bottom line is that I was quite satisfied with this movie.  This is not to say that the film is perfect: when other humans show up it seems impossible, given the isolation of Manhattan and who the humans are, that they are able to get there and and do what they do.  But I round up on \\"I Am Legend\\" because it rings true that Smith's Neville would have slipped over the line into madness given the personal isolation and demons that have tormented him for three years.  His descent is tragic, which makes the resolution of this film so much more preferable to what happens with Heston's character in the other version.  Besides, I likeNeville's taste in works of art to appropriate from MOMA.works of art to appropriate from MOMA.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|As is known, Amy has had a rough time since her big splash. I was introduced to this CD after getting her Back to Black and this finally being released in the U.S. On it, Amy definitely sounds younger, and I like Back to Black better, but Amy shows so much promise and talent in this debut. The songs have a certain feel to them that I can't put my finger on. It's the kind of CD to add to one's collection who is looking for varied, eclectic but good music. Vocally, she lets the listener have it. It is certainly, without question, a solid debut project.    Standout Tracks:    Know you Now--This jazzy cut shows Amy's vocal abilities well. She interprets this song, as if she's been singing jazz for the longest. Plus, the song itself just sounds catchy.    I Heard Love Is Blind--This slow, jazz cut also shows in a more slower vein, Amy's vocal, interpretive abilities. The girl just has natural soul.    In My Bed--This has a familiar beat that's used in a Hip-Hop song I've heard. It's a nice mid-tempo.    To sum it up, this is a nice CD to add to one's collection especially if one already has her 2007 Back to Black. It shows a different side of Amy, but one that is just as strong.

B000YXMMAE|4.0|For the concept (which I'm sure will be imitated slavishly) of releasing mp3's for download and bypassing the music industry, Radiohead are geniuses but that's been talked to death already by everyone so let's focus on the album. \\"In Rainbows\\" with its glitchcore/hiphop backings to its quasi anthemic songs is certainly a return to the sound of \\"Kid A\\" though nowhere near the wild experimentation of it. However, \\"In Rainbows\\" is certainly a more focused album than the great but uneven \\"Hail to the Thief\\" and thus could be entitled a return to form. Is is stylistically groundbreaking? No. Is it the first purchase you'd make if you are new to Radiohead? No but you probably own \\"Ok Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\" already and want to hear their new album so buy it anyway. From what I can see Radiohead are not going to be breaking any trends musically from now (conceptually with marketing yes but as I said that's been discussed) so as a fellow reviewer of mine (give credit where its do)has implied with each new Sonic Youth album, you know you're a getting a Sonic Youth album (though there is certainly more stylistic variation in their recent albums than Radiohead) but you're getting a solid product musically. The same is true for \\"In Rainbows\\". If you've heard their previous albums, don't expect anything dramatic or new (for Radiohead that is) but expect a quality album, eminently listenable. Enough said.

I recommend this video even for those who do not regularly watch nature type programming, as the amazing HD quality makes you feel like you are on a real life adventure, and not just in a classroom learning about nature. This is truly what HD was made for, and if you already have HD, I highly recommend this video for your collection.
B00006AVRK|3.0|Other reviewers have addressed the contents in great and helpful detail; I will comment on the reproductions, which are rather poor.  There seems to have been some sort of ill-advised pan-and-scan at work; some parts of the picture are cut off, which is most noticeable in the opening credits, where parts of the credits for the author and crew's names vanish outside the frame.      In addition, I am dismayed by the quality of the picture representation; these episodes badly need remastering.  The picture quality is blurry and indistinct, and there seems to have been some color loss or color shift.  The sound is rather less full than I would have liked, as well.    Perhaps this is a result of the quality of the original recordings, but I do not remember such poor picture quality on my initial televised viewing.

0143036556|5.0|Jared Diamond, Professor of Geography at U.C.L.A., has written a brilliant sequel to his Pulitzer Prize winning book Guns, Germs, and Steel.  In Collapse, Dr. Diamond looks at the flip side of biogeography: why do some societies fail to survive?  He argues a variety of factors both environmental (natural resource misuse, global warming, etc.) and sociological (hostile vs. helpful neighbors and decision making structures) determines whether societies thrive or pass into the distant memory of time.  Collapse is an expansive book both in scope and detail.  At 535 pages readers will find it challenging but well worth the effort to understand our current plight compared with past civilizations.  Dr. Diamond begins by looking at natural resource issues in Montana where he has spent the last fifty summers.  He analyses many ancient, failed societies like Easter Island, the Anasazi, and the Greenland Norse.  He even takes a fresh and fascinating look at current societies like Rwanda and Haiti.  I am currently planning a unit on biogeography for my AP Environmental Science class using the material from this book as a case study.  This book is so interdisciplinary that almost any science teacher would gain great insight from reading this book and then incorporating some of the material into his/her classroom. This book is also very readable for the general public and is a warning for our society that is so consumer oriented.

B000A2H812|5.0|The first song I heard from this CD was \\"Start Wearing Purple.\\" I hunted it down online, found out it was from Gogol Bordello, and got the CD as fast as I could. I am constantly finding my self singing along with the songs. I can not wait to get their new CD!
B000LC4CVA|4.0|In my opinion this is the best staged performance of the three recorded so far. Best performance also by the Celtic Woman. Unfortunately, the audio suffers from over-editing and use of studio recorded material for some songs. The poor syncing of voice and lips can be annoying and detracts from an otherwise great performance.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|I have never been more disappointed with this series since I started purchasing the DVD sets several years ago. My entire experience with this series has been through the DVD releases and while I have enjoyed most of the seasons, there have been more than their fair share of poorly produced episodes, yet I've stuck with the series.    Having purchased every set of the Stargate SG-1 series as well as Stargate Atlantis, I was amped up when I purchased this DVD, the final battle with the Ori and never, in my life, have I been so disappointed in this series than I have with Stargate: The Ark of Truth.    First off, MGM had overhyped this release to death giving fans of the series the impression that this was the end all battle with the Ori. After finally purchasing this DVD I was so severely disappointed with the movie that I felt robbed of the $18 I had spent on it.    Instead of getting a feature length movie of SG1's battle with the Ori, we're treated to an hour and ten minutes (1:10) of battle with the Replicators. The Ori are nowhere to be seen with the small exception of the opening of the movie as well as the ending of the movie during the final battle with Adria.    While I'm not dismissing the series at all, I would suggest that if you're thinking about buying this movie, don't. Save your money. Hopefully, the next project due out from MGM will save the series: Stargate: Continuum.
B000X3VN46|5.0|I have been a Tarja fan ever since I heard my first Nightwish song, Sleeping Sun. The band went from strength to strength with Tuomas' compositions and Tarja's amazing vocals. I find that it is no coincidence that this talented woman has given a virtuoso performance in her \\"first\\" solo album, My Winter Storm (MWS).    MWS is an outstanding offering from a talented and versatile singer/musician. MWS moves from one tremendous song to the next and Tarja uses her amazing range to bring an eclectic mix. She has the perfect balance of the softer and harder songs and watching her new videos brings me back to her days with Nightwish.     As one reviewer mentioned, \\"I Walk Alone is a great lead off track.\\" I agree. One of my favorites is Ciaran's Well, it ROCKS and the metal Tarja is back! I also love Damned and Divine. Oasis and Ciaran's Well brings  tremendous atmospherics into the mix.     This is a very excellent CD and the mix of songs/styles provides the listener with a rare experience from this wonderful talent. I look for even greater things to come!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|my father called me to tell me he loved the DVD set.  he didn't think he'd enjoy it.  my dad says that the dvd shows all the highlights of the johnny cash series and was enjoying it.  he just had to call me to tell me how much he was enjoying it.  i did good with this purchase :)
B000CPWDO4|5.0|Paladin made some great music-there is at least one really annoying tune on this, but buy it anyway  CD-is ONE CD
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched the Broadway show, too, and also thought that was great. I have seen this movie a bunch of times and will gladly see it again and again. Very worth it to buy!
B00000J7J4|1.0|Bought it as a gift. I LOVE Santana, and Carlos was brilliant to merge himself with todays top artists, BUT, I think todays artists suck, and so the album isnt good. However Santana made a great career move on this
B000WMEAKC|1.0|The 5 star reviews for this album are hilarious.  This is probably the best example Ive ever seen of 'manufactured music'.  It is very safe, and blends two boring radio bands (coldplay and radiohead) into one boring radio band.  If you enjoy being spoon fed garbage, please, by all means get this album.  If you enjoy your music with an ounce of feeling, you may find this album offensive to your very core.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|What is there to say? Cats has good tunes, and is a great performance--just had to own a copy of the show
074356619X|5.0|The commentary on this isn't anything that you'll remember and the content is just okay.  Anyone who believes The Secret, obviously has no relationship with God, but I had to listen to see what the big hullabaloo was about.  It's no secret anymore.  The Secret will pass into oblivion.
B000EPFPVU|4.0|I've just been listening to the import cd next to an mp3 10,000 days album that I downloaded and I can't honestly really tell any difference between the two.  I'm using a pair of Sennheiser HD595 headphones with a Sound Blaster Audigy 2 Platinum sound card so I'm using a pretty decent setup.  If you're buying this album thinking that you were going to get some type of far superior product, then you're going to be a bit disapointed like I was.  The cd may be superior, but even with good audio equipment, It's very hard or impossible to notice.  I give it 5 stars for the album, 3 stars for the value.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Great acting, super story and wonderful drama and suspense!  Need more movies like this around.  All actors are truly Oscar worthy here.
0446577391|3.0|It was a good read, but I don't buy into \\"the CIA is a bunch of criminals\\".  Also, claimed hero was a Navy SEAL, yet called him Sargent!  That is a pretty basic detail to screw up!<br /><br />Signed Master Chief Steve Ryder.
0060920084|1.0|I usually like Bill Bryson's books - Notes from a Small Island, a Walk in the Woods, I'm a Stranger Here Myself, A Short History of Nearly Everything, all made me laugh.  But not The Lost Continent.  This one was one long complaint of a roadtrip; Bryson doesn't seem to find anything he enjoys until he gets to Yellowstone.  There's no detail of his travels, just a repetitive litany of how bad the food is, how horrible the motel, how fat the tourists, and how dull the road.  It's not worth the read.
B000UJ48V8|1.0|Although I enjoyed seeing the training part of this move (my brother recently went through it and became a Marine), the movie does end up feeling un-American and un-Patriotic. But this is not a surprise, since when does Holly Wood create anything positive about the nation that gives it the freedom to create boring unpatriotic movies.<br /><br />The main reason I took time to right this review is to warn everyone that the video quality is truly horrible for an HD DVD. If you like this movie for its story or for some other reason, maybe you should just get the DVD. This HD DVD is definitely not one you would want to show someone if your trying to convince them to upgrade to HD.
1400064627|5.0|Before deciding to read this book, I have never wanted to actually sit down and watch the Fried Green Tomatoes movie. Now, however, I'm really looking forward for the chance to see it! I loved the complex setup of the story through the use of different narrators. I've heard numerous times that Evelyn Couch was the most disliked character. I, however, liked Evelyn and disliked Idgie! Yes, call me strange...    This was a wonderful read, though. I'm very glad I got the chance to read such a wonderful story, especially through the eyes of the dear Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode.
0805079831|5.0|Many other reviewers have already made excellent comments about the content of this exemplary work not only on the dangers of \\"free-trade\\" and other laissez-faire doctrines pushed by a small but powerful minority in this country and others.<br /><br />I will not attempt to add any more to the discussion of content, which I must say is rather startling in its depth of knowledge and clarity.<br /><br />I will recommend however, that if you want to know what is going on in this country, if you want to know the disastrous outcomes that happened in other countries from the United States/Chicago School philosophy, and will soon be happening here, GO READ THIS BOOK. I will certainly be recommending it to anyone who is willing to read it.<br /><br />I must also add that the ending is inspirational as it highlights the Latin American revival, a formula a social activism and popular movement that I hope will emerge in the United States... before it's too late.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I bought this for our 5-year-old grandson for his birthday, and it is one of his favorite toys ever.  It encourages creativity and imaginative play, and I can see that he'll enjoy it for many years.  It seemed pricey, but is definitely worth it--deceptively simple.  I wish there were more depictions of projects included.
B000YENUI6|4.0|How sad.<br /><br />Here we live in the Western world where dreams abound--the immigrant arrives from the home front, running from a situation in which he can no longer abide hoping that with a change in venue super-charged with new opportunities life will proffer that mythical cup of ambrosia.  The actuality approaches a bleakness that builds to a wave of silent paranoia.  Instead of that cornucopia fraught with starry-eyed promises, he discovers a microcosmic facsimile of the world from which he left, filled with some good--the bittersweet albeit confusing sounds and flavors of the familiar translated and assimilated within the confines of the new surroundings--but mostly bad--a recreation of the same infernally instinctual caste system the &eacute;migr&eacute; sought to initially avoid but robotically approaches like a moth to the flame.<br /><br />In the 2007 film \\"Eastern Promises\\", director David Cronenberg (\\"A History of Violence\\" and \\"Dead Ringers\\") and screenwriter, Steve Knight (\\"Dirty Pretty Things\\") explore the nature of this imbalanced seesaw of disillusion.  Setting their story in the London of various Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, they imbue the film's overall ambiance with a distinctly Eastern European miasma that suggests a steamy blood-colored borscht filtered through the cold and quintessential gray pea-soup--a far cry from the shining yellow emission of Dick Wittingham's city whose fabled streets are reputed to be paved with gold.<br /><br />Swirling about in all this grittiness, float new Londoners of various assimilative degrees.  The pretty midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) serves as a shocked onlooker openly and vocally reflecting the thoughts and reactions of the unseen audience.  In the course of her work, she comes across the tragic Tatiana, a pregnant teen found hemorrhaging on the floor of a local pharmacy.  In failing to save the life of the ill-fated mother, she feels obliged to discover a family relation for the newborn child, the only clue to this a diary written in Russian that Anna has not the linguistic skills to translate.  A business card found within the pages of the journal, leads her to the formidable Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), owner of a red velvet Russian Tea Room clone replete with the homey music of \\"Ochi Chernye\\" and balalaikas that act as a cover for the operations of the criminal syndicate `vory v zakone' not unlike the facade of the Genco Olive Oil Company shielding the Corleones.<br />And like the celluloid gangster family, Semyon boasts an heir-apparent to his throne.  Kiril, played with a wicked insecurity by French actor Vincent Cassel oscillates between party boy and hot-headed killer in a psychotic conglomeration of the Sonny/Fredo archetypes of \\"The Godfather.\\"<br /><br />Best of all is Nikolai, Kiril's driver and aspiring vory v zakone climber, the taciturnly menacing Viggo Mortensen who flits along the fringes of a somewhat desired normalcy, flirting with Anna while fixing her motorcycle and cautioning her alliance with the steel-cored Semyon, yet wearing his gangster curriculum vitae on his body in a series of rank-stating tattoos and grisly actions that speak louder than his non-words.  Mortensen's performance borders on brilliant--I didn't think he could top his Tom Stall role in \\"The History of Violence.\\"  Nonetheless, he does and does it well, particularly in two scenes where his nudity shows his vulnerability and empathy for the parts of his job that are distasteful to him and displays a primordial flare for survival that transcends the boundary of the typical action-packed fighting segment and becomes a strobe-lit sequence of the masculine form that suggests a sculpture in motion.  Cronenberg and Mortensen form a fascinating film-making alliance which I hope continues.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Director David Cronenberg teams up with lead actor Viggo Mortensen and writer Steve Knight to tell a tale of disillusioned hopes in the film \\"Eastern Promises.\\"  Despite somegritty depictions of violence amidst themes involving the seedier money-generating operations of the Russian mafia, the combination of talents manages to balance the darkness with some light and generate an entertaining film with distinctive performances, especially in the case of Mortensen.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is the best christmas movie. We watch it every year. We just got a new big screen TV and had to have this movie on DVD.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Absolutely Fabulous.  I became hooked with Baldacci after reading the Camel Club and this is the great and supreme sequel.  I finally get to find out the real story about John Carr aka Oliver Stone.  The justice at the end is the supreme climax for the Camel Club and John Carr.  The book is action packed.  I couldn't put it down.  I read my Kindle version in one day.  I feel bad because a good guy dies,  and typical of Baldacci, you are left hanging for a sequel.  Does Stone live or die?  Will John Carr emerge or die, or is the man really dead and new team is about to take the Camel Club to its magnificent novel addicts.  Great Job, David Baldacci.[[ASIN:0595265189 Bear River Spirit]]
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an incredibly realistic portrayal of WWII.  It is one of my favorite TV programs ever, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre.  This is a 10 hour series in the style of Saving Private Ryan, and it is worth every minute.  The show is definitely violent, and there is a substantial amount of blood, but it is always tasteful and never overdone.  Hanks and Spielberg give you a picture of the war that is exciting and interesting, while at the same time avoiding the tendency that many directors have to glorify it.  Easiest five stars I have ever given in a review.
1881273377|4.0|It all depends where you are in the relationship journey. If you are a connoiseur, been to workshop, read lots of books, has created great friendships and  lived amazing love stories, then you won't find too much on this CD. If you are in the beginner stage or you just can;t figure out this relationship thing, definitely get it, you will get some insights.  On the side, it could be just my impression, but the author kind of creates this aura around himself of a relationship saver. This \\"aura\\", by the third CD, starts  to be annoying to me.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This was the WORST book to movie translation!!!  I stumbled into this movie and throught it was pretty good, so I ran out and bought the book...shouldn't have done that! RUINT, RUINT I tell you, the movie should have been made like the lord of the rings or something!! Totally slashed the book, anialated it, the movie should have never been made like this!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I bought this right after it came out on DVD without knowing at all what I was getting.  It was probably the most worthwhile purchase I've made in years.  North & South is the best period piece I've seen, better even than well-beloved adaptations of Jane Austen.  It's beautifully scored and beautifully filmed-- some of the best scenes are those within the cotton mill, really otherworldly and wintry and gorgeous.  I love the story-- it deals not only with the society and the romance and the family dramas, but quite a bit of the social commentary and class conflicts that typify Elizabeth Gaskell's novels.  It's just a pleasure to watch.    If you like this you would probably also like another recent BBC miniseries-- Dickens' Bleak House.  A lot darker and about twice as long but well made.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Simply wonderful.  That's the best way to define it.  Granted it's not always an \\"easy\\" watch (near-real war scenes never are), but the quality and overall presentation of this series really hits home.  Every year, we get further and further away from what happened in WW2, and sadly, the important lessons that we learned.  Band of Brothers reminds us of the things many of us have forgotten or never knew.
B000002OVJ|5.0|My mentor mentioned that playing \\"The Who\\" would help me when I am writing... especially those late night deadline crunching 2am stints to get the assignments in by 8am the next morning...   Doesn't matter what time of day (okay, yes it does... The WHo are not quite as effective before 12noon :) )... this has truly proved to inspire my creative energy and helped me flow much better.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|So, I know there are people out there who still want to continue living their life as they always have, not being concerned about how their actions and inactions affect their legacy, but I say to them, at least give your children a chance to decide for themselves.  They've heard your rhetoric all their lives, so why not let them hear another viewpoint for a change?  If you are right, then they'll see through all this BS, right?      Personally, I am also still open to the possibility that we may be over-blowing how much impact our human endeavors are having on the biosphere, but I am not so reckless and pompous as to say that protecting my lifestyle is more important than addressing the possibility that there is a global crisis that we may be able to do something about.    The film does a great job of spelling out the issue and some of the data supporting the basic assertion of the movie (and anyone who follows current events will know that more recent data paint an even more dire picture than the movie paints).  Be a good parent and let your children get involved in shaping the future.  If you are not a parent then be a good citizen and consider being less selfish.....what do you have to lose except some of your excesses?

0385751532|5.0|Coming from South Africa, where I grew up as a child in the heart of the apartheid regime, this book moved me immensely. As a child I was vaguely & uneasily aware of something being wrong, but it is just the life that I was born into. Children accept and try to make childish sense of their lives. This book should be read and discussed in high schools across the world.    It is so simply written that the ending is a shock that lives within me. I devoured the book in half a day. It left me with ambivalent feelings of horror and satisfaction. I am interested to read more of his work.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Richard Farnsworth at his best, wonderful humanistic story.  Badalamenti's haunting music.
0374105235|3.0|A Long Way Gone appeals to the reader's emotions but achieves little else.  I would congratulate the author's courage in relating this tragic and horrific tale, but as a true memoir it falls very short.  There is little reflection on his experiences, as he uses lovely but mostly repetitive imagery describing his inner turmoil.  Perhaps that will come later in his life.  Some details didn't fit together.  His cassette tapes are very important to the story, yet are only mentioned a couple of times and the reader wonders how they could have possibly survived through repeated drenching with rough weather and difficult travel conditions.  I think the glowing reviews reflect only our obsession with our own emotional reactions to tragedy no matter what the quality of writing.  I applaud Mr. Beah's courage in surviving such carnage but hope his future writing moves beyond retelling just the facts to offer some insight into his and his country's experiences.
0792164903|4.0|I really had no expectations before watching this movie but REALLY enjoyed it. I can't add much to what has already been said by others, and agree it is destined to become a classic. Johnny Depp plays another nervous, eccentric, brilliant character and Miranda Richardson & Christopher Walken do not disappoint. Tim Burton puts his macabre signature on a classic tale with some strange new twists. Every time I thought I had it figured out I was proven wrong and the figurative fog lifting at the end was a nice touch.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I still nurse a grudge against Joel Silverman for mucking up the Batman series by stuffing it with way too many villains in the belief that it somehow bolsters the franchise.  And yet I understand: each supervillain means another toy, another lunchbox, another backpack that gets created.  They are literally worth millions, and to justify the budgets of superhero movies, action figures and other returns add up.<br /><br />But that's a cynical way of looking at it.  What happened to just focusing on making a good movie?<br /><br />Spider-Man 3, as you guessed, fell victim to the same problem.  And that's a shame.  At one point my wife turned to me and said, \\"you know, this movie isn't nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be.\\"  I agreed with her.  It was the scene when Peter was talking to Aunt May about proposing to Mary Jane.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes later, she changed her mind.<br /><br />Raimi does an excellent job of taking the superhero foibles and following them to their logical conclusion.  In a lot of ways, it's not unlike being a famous actor.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) learns that just because he's Spider-Man doesn't mean he can kiss girls in public while hanging upside from a web, ESPECIALLY if she's a hottie (the delectable Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy).  When things are looking great for Parker, Mary Jane Watson's (Kirsten Dunst, seeming a bit deflated in this film) career is tanking.  Sounds familiar, like something you'd read in a tabloid...<br /><br />Raimi and his cast handle all of these issues with grace.  And I don't mean Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock and later Venom.  There are no less than three villains in this film, one being Sandman (Thomas Haden Church playing Flint Marko, and he nails the look), the other being Venom the alien parasite. And we can't forget Harry Osborn (James Franco) as the new Goblin.  At various points in the film, it feels like bad guys just get thrown at Parker while he's driving down the street.<br /><br />Mind you, the special effects are amazing.  This is the first true, knockdown, drag out superhero battle that pulls no punches.  Between Goblin's aerial antics, Sandman's shapeshifting, and the amazing acrobatics of Spider-Man, this movie is so action packed with amazing feats of strength and agility that it's hard to look away.<br /><br />There's a convoluted connection to Marko that at least explains why he's in the film.  But Venom is another story.  He literally drops out of the sky, sneaks into Parker's room, and then takes him over.  The concept of Venom is already ludicrous to begin with: an alien parasite that bonds with people but mimics Spider-Man's powers during the Secret Wars on Battleworld, placed there by a being known as the Beyonder.  Hey, it was the 80s, give Marvel a break.<br /><br />A lot of the back-story is jettisoned in exchange for...no back-story at all.  The parasite just shows up in an asteroid.  It bonds with Spider-Man's suit.  It turns him evil.  For no reason.<br /><br />Other stuff like this happens.  At one point, Osborn threatens Mary Jane, forcing her to break it off with Peter or he'll kill him.  And she does.  When Spider-Man defeats Goblin (and, near as I can tell, killed him), nothing further is mentioned.  Doesn't Mary Jane want to explain what she did and why?  How come the police weren't called, when the first near-death experience with Goblin ends up (realistically) in an emergency room? Don't even get me started on the amnesia that strikes Osborn at a convenient moment...<br /><br />And so it goes.  Sandman is practically invincible, so fights with him are pointless.  We get an interesting back-story about his drive to save his daughter from illness, but then the film does nothing with it.  And since Sandman can fly (news to me), he's like a ghost.  You can't beat him.  Which makes one wonder...why fight Spider-Man at all?  And certainly, why would a powerful immortal-level being like Sandman team up with Venom, acrazy alien nutjob?<br /><br />We don't get our answers.  Spider-Man has an overarching theme of forgiveness, but I found it difficult to forgive the obvious cramming of too many ideas.  I suspect this is the installment where principal actors bow out.  I can't blame them.ng theme of forgiveness, but I found it difficult to forgive the obvious cramming of too many ideas.  I suspect this is the installment where principal actors bow out.

0143038419|4.0|This book is well-organized; the structure and numbering of the chapters is a clever touch that grounds the memoirs. Gilbert is a talented writer whose vivid descriptions move the stories along at a good pace. The ending was a bit weak - the third part of the book was not as strong as the first two and didn't have as solid a conclusion as I was expecting after being so firmly drawn in.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Remy is a rat who, deviating from his rat clan, pursues his penchant for cooking gourmet food by infiltrating an upscale Paris restaurant. To accomplish his quest, Remy must free himself from the limitations of social and economic class (his rat family speaks in the intonations of working-class Italians) as he ascends the social and cultural latter in an animated film that pits the limitations of social class against the idea of individual freedom and ambition. With this simple conflict and plot, the film makes fun of the snobbish food culture. The film's most striking strength are its visuals, as Ratatouille ups the ante in Pixar animation.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Okay first of all, yes, advertising this release as being the complete soundtrack is bad form.    This is speculation, but I think the release of this 3 disc album broke down something like this:    Vangelis's people would have made him aware of the various bootlegs that have sprung up over the past 15 years. (I think it's safe to say that there have probably been more bootleg variation of the Blade Runner soundtrack than any other movie, some 3 dozen of them in fact: go check out such sites as vangelis-rarities for a list of some of the examples.) So what I think happened was this: Vangelis took a look at all this stuff and thought, \\"Well, if die-hard fans already have all this stuff, or even some of it, then what's the point of me giving them it all over again?!\\"    (The point, of course, is that it would have been 'official' and would have been in digitially remastered sound, but of no moment...)    So instead of repackaging all the cues from the bootlegs into an 'official' release Vangelis decided to give the fans almost entirely new music.    It's interesting to note that almost all the fans over on the International Vangelis Forum are delighted with this release. Why? Precisely because it's 'all new music'! The ones who are whining are the film's fans who simply want the actual soundtrack as it appears in the movie. (In which case virtually all of these fans already have it, in the form of the widely available bootlegs, such as the Esper Edition and the Deck Definitive release.)    Now, mind you, I'm a huge fan of the movie (like most people here I have the 5 disc boxset) and I can understand people's wish to simply have the soundtrack's cues sans sound effects and dialogue, and to that end I would have preferred if Vangelis had removed the dialogue from the first disc of this 3CD release, as opposed to simply including the '94 edition unaltered.    It helps, however, to remember this: Vangelis has NEVER revisited the soundtrack to any of the movies he's worked on. Blade Runner is the exception. It's interesting to note that nowhere - unlike ALL of his other official soundtrack releases, including the recent Alexander and El Greco - does the legend 'Original Motion Picture Soundtrack' appear on the '94 release, or for that matter this '07 release, other than that red sticker. This is a 3CD 'album' in celebration of the movie, NOT a soundtrack.     Vangelis has NEVER been interested in taking the exact edits of his cues from a movie and packaging them onto a CD. THIS is what Blade Runner's film fans want. Vangelis will never do this (and precisely BECAUSE there are so many bootlegs that do exactly that he no doubt feels, \\"What's the point, you have all this material already?\\") Instead Vangelis prefers to have his soundtrack releases stand on their own as legitimate albums, and not merely a collection of cues, to the point where he will often rearrange certain tracks for their official album release. This is clearly evident on 1492: Conquest of Paradise and Alexander, where the tracks are not only shorter - or in some cases even longer - than how they appear in the movie, but in addition they have been subtly rearranged. Both of these movies boast 2CD Complete Score bootlegs. Both of these bootleg releases are inferior to the far shorter official single disc releases. Why? Because they're bland, flat - THEY'RE TOO LONG! They don't stand on their own as albums. Most film cues are only a minute or two long, especially in the case of Blade Runner, and whereas these work terrifically within the context of the actual movie, they rarely stand on their own, or even if they do they simply don't flow properly if ran together with the film's other cues when placed onto an album.    Vangelis has always been more concerned with his soundtrack releases maintaining their own sense of cohesion than simply taking the easy route of lazily throwing a whole bunch of cues onto a disc. Sure, this would have delighted the film's fans, but the film and the separate release of the music on CD are two different things, two different mediums.    The majority of Vangelis fans are happy with this 3CD release because it gives us two CDs of brand new music which COMPLIMENT the bootlegs which almost all of us already have.    And, for those few who don't owned the bootlegs, please don't buy them from eBay. Members of such sites as the yahoo group bladerunner_soundtrack will happily provide them free of charge.    Blade Runner's film fans are simply going to have to learn to listen to this release as they would an ordinary album; it's clear that this release was meant for Vangelis fans and not Blade Runner's film fans per se.

1592332803|5.0|Ther are so many reasons to love this cookbook as well as the author.First the cookbook is beautiful. Second the recipes are to die for especially the lemon cheesecake. My husband who is not vegan loved ever bite and was shock to learn it contained no animal products( i waited until he finished and gave his comment on how good it was)to tell him.Finally I visited the author's blog and she renewed my commitment to becoming and staying vegan.Thanks Colleen for caring enough to write this cookbook and have a caring heart for the planet and animals.
B000001GPW|2.0|Clever.  Perhaps cunning even.<br /><br />But this music is anything but pleasant.<br /><br />This is music for intellectuals, for the bookish, for nervous moles.  This is music to be looked at -- not experienced.<br /><br />Typically Bart&oacute;k, this selection provides the predictable clever quips and hiccups, the cacophony and dysphony for which we know him.<br /><br />It is studied disillusionment.<br /><br />It is pre-post-modernism.<br /><br />Picture a gaunt, twenty-year old youth, dressed in black, unshaven, with chunks and patches of an incipient beard here and there unevenly across his face.  A long, dark hair here, a soft bit of fuzz there.<br /><br />One wants to buy him a good razor.<br /><br />No, the music is not pretty, but one can imagine Bart&oacute;k flipping through music books, picking a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  And just when one begins to fall asleep, the volume rises and a bit of arrhythmic disharmony jars one awake.<br /><br />I think Bart&oacute;k envies the athletic kids, but in the end his attempt at energy sounds but pale, clumsy, and nervous.<br /><br />The music has great potential, if only Bart&oacute;k got a good shave.<br /><br />&lt;sigh>
B000E1MXSW|5.0|One of my childhood favorites has lost nothing over the decades since its original release.  I saw it more than once then and plan to do so now.  Great acting and an incredibly gripping story.  It's a winner and I'm delighted to have this high-quality DVD in my collection.
B000HEWEJO|4.0|I had heard great things about this movie and had never seen it.  Good movie...very old time but good.
B000TLTUL0|3.0|So my wife tells me that she wants to see this movie. No surprise she's a Johnny Depp fan (I'm not). It took everything within me to hide my reluctance. Did I mention I'm not a Johnny Depp fan? Anyway, My wife and I stroll into the theatre, sit in our over priced seats, and I prepare myself for what I'm convinced will be two hours of absolute torcher (did I mention I'm not a Johnny Depp fan). Much to my surprise this movie actually had some quality to it. A musical version of a barber who loses everything, goes mad, and starts to murder everyone. That aside, I was actually impressed with the movie as a whole. The singing was good, the plot was decent, and the acting above average. Of course my favorable review could be somewhat tarnished by the fact that the last film I saw Depp in (Pirates of The Caribbean 3) was HORRIBLE... I doubt he could have disappointed me less with this film. Keeping that in mind I will give this film 3.5 stars. A decent plot, good singing, above average acting (by hollywood standards), and I can honestly say I could sit through it again. Given that this is not my choice of entertainment this is probably about as glowing of a review this film could have hoped for from me. After all this is just one man's honest opinion.<br /> Take Care,<br />Marc :)

B00004IC9G|5.0|ManOWar is the best of all Heavy Metal Bands.  This was their first album unleashed to the world.  I recommend this to all ManOWar fans and any heavy metal fan!  The guitar rifs and the beats are outstanding.  Its no suprise as to why these guys hold the world record for the loudest concert in the world.
0316018953|5.0|I am an avid Connelly fan but this was one of his best. The characters were well develolped and the plot with so many loops that suspense built by the second. I finished the book in one day as I could not put it down. The ending, although a surprise, flowed naturally from the plot development. Connelly uses descriptive language masterfully. He is exciting to read.
0679411585|5.0|This book is extremely well written.  I'm not a soldier, but I could easily follow the battle sequences, in fact, they had me riveted to my seat.  I couldn't put the book down.      There are numerous detailed reviews, so I won't get into the minutae of the book.  I'll only say that this book gave me a true appreciation for what our Soldiers and Marines went through during the ground war in Vietnam.  Many of the battles are written in such gut wrenching detail I felt like I was in the trench with the soldiers.      I highly recommend this book.

0007113323|5.0|My military service has given me the opportunity to travel around Europe for the past 15 years and this is the best bird guide I've purchased.  The drawings are accurate, the text filled with interesting and helpful facts and, best of all, the range maps make for rapid (and accurate) field identifications.  This book is a keeper.
0375815996|5.0|This is a very fun book!  Our son (11 months) lights up whenever we sit down to read it together.  He loves taking the baby bird out of the egg and then through the story.  (We did cut baby bird off the ribbon because it seemed sort of restrictive.)  I read the original version at a bookstore the other day, and I think that the cloth version is better.  It sticks to the action and moves more quickly.  I would recommend this for any baby's book shelf.

0321525655|5.0|This is everything that I want my presentations to be when I'm up on stage...  Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery by Garr Reynolds.  This will make you rethink everything you've known (and likely done) about how a presentation should be designed.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Introduction: Presenting in Today's World<br />Preparation: Creativity, Limitations, and Constraints; Planning Analog; Crafting the Story<br />Design: Simplicity - Why It Matters; Presentation Design - Principles and Techniques; Sample Slides<br />Delivery: The Art of Being Completely Present; Connecting With an Audience<br />The Next Step: The Journey Begins<br />Photo Credits; Index<br /><br />There's so much good stuff here that it's hard to figure out where to begin.  Reynolds advocates for a departure from the ordinary style of presentation involving PowerPoint.  You've all sat through those (or given them)...  Pages of slides, chock full of text, gratuitous use of special effects, etc.  Presentation Zen is more about simplicity and storytelling.  Your slides should support *you*, the speaker.  If someone can get all the information from your slides, why do they need you?  Your slides should not overwhelm the audience, but should draw their attention to the point that you are making in your talk.  Couple this approach with the ability to tell stories rather than recite facts, and you can put together presentations that will be appreciated, remembered, and best of all, acted upon.<br /><br />He also gets into how best to design appealing and arresting slides.  Reynolds uses sites like iStockPhoto to avoid the overused and cheesy clipart that comes part and parcel with PowerPoint.  And rather than just pasting a graphic on the screen under some text, the graphic *becomes* the slide, and the minimal text is positioned on the graphic in such a way that the slide becomes a work of art.  Since I do technical presentations, my first objection was that this doesn't give the listener anything to take away in terms of content.  But rather than make your slides the take-away, Reynolds suggests that you put together a separate \\"handout\\" document that can be given out after the talk (or downloaded).  That document can contain the details and facts that you present, without overwhelming the listener during the actual talk.  It's a simple concept, but not one that I've seen done often.<br /><br />The bad thing about a book like this is it points out just how bad I actually am at presenting.  The good thing is that it challenges me (as well as shows me) to get a whole lot better.  This should be required reading for anyone before they start to put together anything in PowerPoint...content.

B00004YA66|5.0|Excellent movie ! Jolae
B0000DJZB9|3.0|Why is \\"You Could Be Mine\\" not included here?  Maybe it's related to Arnold or the song being in the movie, but it's very unsatisfying to watch this and see no YCBM on it.  Also, I wish Sweet Child O'Mine could have been the full version of the song (without the truncated intro), but that's not the band's fault I would guess, but the record label.  Anyway, this is a standard DVD so it looks lame in terms of picture quality, but converted to 320x240 AVC and playing on my PSP it looks great!
0143038419|2.0|I disagreed with the author from the first time I heard the premise of her book. I thought she was looking for a way to justify and perhaps even capitalize on what was essentially a midlife crisis. And, after having read the book, I can't entirely discard my initial harsh opinion BUT parts of her journey, spoken in her voice did resonate with essential and basic parts of the human experience and she decribes these moments in an engaging way. So, her writing was good but I still poo-poo her attempt to justify an ordinary midlife crisis by dealing with it via a uniquely privileged method. Not to mention the media sensation and cult it has created in it's wake.    I wonder if she did not have her career (writer with connections) as a vehicle to carry her through her self discovery if she perhaps would have focused instead on the philosophy of not harming anything because we are all part of the same cosmic goo. Would she then have \\"stuck out\\" her marriage and her ultimate choice of ending a marriage (so cliche these days, dontcha know)and found enlightenemnt by looking beyond her own needs and Id?    Uh oh I may have just sown a seed for another author's next book (Live, Grow & Enjoy?).....sorry all! That might not be so bad though if a million people could jump on THAT bandwagon--self-sacrifice, eschewing egomania, decency, morals. Wow, look at the time! I gotta go, America's Next Top Model starts in 5 minutes!
0743486285|4.0|This is a true account of a man that had it all and didn't know how to handle it. It was alittle boring in some places (got up, did drugs, hid in the closet again) but I really enjoyed most of it. The art in the book is amazing and supports the hell he was going through.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I saw Neil Young on this tour, and it was one of the best shows I've ever attended. Greendale is a concept album, and he played it start to finish; he had an ensemble of maybe 20 people with him on stage that helped act the story out with the help of various props and multimedia. In between songs, Neil talked to the audience about the story, filling in gaps in the plot. All this helped drive the thing home -- for me, at least. Others weren't as impressed, and either heckled Neil to play his old stuff, or just left.<br /><br />I mention all this because if you are going into this album cold (w/o the concert context) there's a good chance you will be either disappointed or disenfranchized. It's nice that this cd includes a dvd of Neil doing the album live, because that has most of the between-song talking to help fill in the story, plus it's accoustic so you get reworked versions of the tunes. However, you still miss a lot of the effect from not seeing it in full production. For example, during \\"Leave the Driving\\" Neil was running video clips of (I think) Dick Cheney giving a press confrence, which puts a new spin on the line \\"Don't raise a fuss, just leave the driving to us.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, it's been four years or so since I'd seen the show, I finally picked up a copy of the album. I was actually disappointed by it; most of the songs on here seem fairly weak compared to Young's vast corpus, and just didn't have the impact of the live show. Partly it's the studio performance: done live when I heard them, they all had a grungy anger and energy, but that just somehow seems missing here. I dare say that most of the songs on here are ultimately forgettable. Sure there are exceptions, notably \\"Sun Green\\", but I doubt that anything off this album has entered Neil's live set list since its release. [I'm sure some Young fan will leave an angry comment proving me wrong, so mea culpa if so.]<br /><br />This really is a difficult album to rate. I'm tempted to give it 5 stars out of concert nostalgia, but I strongly suspect that if I were listening to this now for the first time, I'd only give it 3 or so. I can also see die-hard Young fans hating it -- as many did during the show. Then again, I thought it was their loss.a, but I strongly suspect that if I were listening to this now for the first time, I'd only give it 3 or so.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|Bruce Willis really is at his best in Live Free or Die Hard. The movie is just the perfect action film except for one scene (where Bruce is attacked by a F35 fighter aircraft) which borders on ridicule.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I bought this set for my husband for Christmas.  We didn't start watching the show until the second season and we just love it.  We were looking forward to seeing the first season.  I was a little worried it might not be a funny as the current shows since it seems that sometimes a new show needs some time to gel but - no worries.  The first season is just as great as the show is today.  I am not one for watching re-runs, ever, but this is one of the very few shows, I can watch over and over.

B000YAA6AU|5.0|After forcing my girlfriend to sit through Walk Hard & Alien Vs. Preadtor 2 I was dragged to see P.S. I Love You and I have to say that I was pleasntly surpised. Unless she's playing a man Hilary Swank in my opinion always plays Hilary Swank in every from The Core to Freedom Writers. Mrs/ Swanks gave one of her better performances as Holly and earned a new respect from me. The chemistry between Swank and Butler is charming and heartbreaking when their love is lost. The emotions are geunine and the tears are earned and not forced unlike some romantic films. I want go into anymore deatil about the filn as the trailers pretty much give away the plot, but if your romantic at heart then this is a film you'll enjoy.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|This movie really surprised me as being great in suspense and acting.  The two old twins who used to own a copy of the book, (\\"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow\\") in portugal for example are just weird and spot on.  The story keeps you interested and takes you to many locations.  I loved the detective work of Depp examining the two other nine gates and how they differ.  Who is the mysterious green eyed girl?  Why does Balkan, the rich book tycoon, want all three existing copies?  What does the nineth gate actually do?  Find out!
B00005JLD4|5.0|Word of mouth via email is all it took for me to get this movie from Amazon.com and I'm so glad I did.  What a great movie. Even my husband liked it, and he's not usually into these kinds of films.  Great story-line, great acting, superb dialogue, beautiful scenery, just a well put together movie.  The under-current message of this film reminds me a lot of the phenomenal Ron Paul for President campaign and movement.  Powerfully positive.

B000002UB3|4.0|Big fans of The Beatles can automatically bump my fours stars up to five. As for the rest of us (I consider myself a 'Classic Rock Fan'), I'm going to approach this review by rating \\"Abbey Road\\" against the numerous past works of The Beatles. And, because I have lived through the entire era of Beatlemania, and bought each of their ablums as they emerged on the market, I have a good Woodstocker's handle on the 'then and now' perspective of this music and all their other yield as well.<br /><br />Here we have 'the [1969] Good-bye album'. The Fab Four were pretty much sick of one another at this point (and can we blame them?) and at least three of the four (Paul, John, and George) were clearly all for going their own ways -- this album is a clear reflection of those aggregate paradigms.<br /><br />The music on \\"Abbey Road\\" is quite good; however, as a complete work it's a sort of mix-match of incongruent compositions (both long and short songs), and varying styles. We get a taste of The Beatles from all three of their musical periods (but mostly from the final period) and it would have been nice had the final album been a reflection of 'fluid maturity tenoned with a culmination of brilliance'. But this is the real world and we have to take what we can get, or perhaps endure it.<br /><br />I call this one 'the last [The] Beatles album' but, to be technically correct, \\"Abbey Road\\" was the last album commenced by The Beatles prior to their disbandment. It's way far from being their best work (if you want that, grab \\"Revolver,\\" \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" and \\"The Beatles\\" [The White Album], the first from the tail-end of their 'early period' and the latter three from their psychedelic 'middle period').... but \\"Abbey Road\\" is nice, very nice.<br /><br />On \\"Abbey Road\\" each of The Beatles hazarded 'a stab' at composition and at singing leads, even Ringo with his \\"Octopus's Garden.\\" The top cuts are clearly \\"Come Together\\" (Lennon) and \\"Something\\" (Harrison). THE Beatle, Paul McCartney, contributed a mediocre \\"Oh! Darling!\\" and could not seem to emerge from his middle-period mindset. In fact, \\"Abbey Road\\" might well represent The Beatles step-child composer, George Harrison's, Magnum opus because his gum-drop rock \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" also received a LOT of radio play when this album first hit the streets and I still hear it occasionally on classic rock stations.<br /><br />And, of course, the album's cover conveys one of the huge 'Paul Is Dead' trivia entries, all the way from Paul's bare feet to the cigarette in his right hand to the license plate on the Volkswagon Beetle. There are more (supposed) clues but such minutia are mostly of interest to only the more rabid, drooling Beatlemaniacs. By the way, if you acquire the CD you'll need a really good magnifying glass to check all this out! *.*<br /><br />I should note for the record that by early Fall, 1969 when \\"Abbey Road\\" was released, not only were The Beatles sick of one another, but hippies in general were sick of one another too. This was two summers beyond the so-called 'Summer of Love' [1967] and the euphoria of those great days was quickly wearing off. The enthisiasm for certain types of rock music was changing quickly and radically and I really believe that The Beatles had pretty much drunk their well dry anyway.<br /><br />So to summarize, as art, this album/CD has its notable flaws. As music of The Beatles, not even the most casual fan could hardly pass this one by (no pun intended).ibuted a mediocre \\"Oh! Darling!\\" and could not seem to emerge from his middle-period mindset.

0743487486|5.0|This is a book that is very readable, however, it has so many wonderfully deep ideas that I found myself taking breaks from it every few chapters just to absorb the information he presented.  It is probably a book I will reread a year from now as well.  I am so glad I found this book when I did.  Very well written and thoughtful premises.

They would have loved it just as Caitlin and my 9-month old grandson does.  A great little book that can be used for many years and at many depths.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|When I was 12, I saw this thing so many times I can't even remember. It was my favorite movie for a long time. Prior to getting this disc for Xmas, I would say it has been 10 years since I had last watched it. And I was impressed, still. While I don't feel the same about this now as I did when I was younger, I was def. very entertained. But the look on blu ray totally blew me away!! It really does look as though it was made last year picture-wise; There were still a few cheesy things here and there(the sped-up chase footage in one part was a little obvious; the over-use of school athletic gear was amusing; one of the girls in the good guy's camp looks like Baby Spice from the Spicegirls...), but this movie was way ahead of it's time back then...One of the greatest chase scenes comes at the end! A great action movie, even after 25+ years.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|We and our 3 and 5.5 year-olds are big fans of movies like Shrek, Wallace and Gromit, Cars, Madagasgar, Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., but Ratatouille disappointed us.  The story has scenes that are unnecessarily violent and/or scary, and there are plot elements that are complicated to explain to a five year old. Unlike the above movies, sustaining our adult interest was a strain.  It's visually well done and has good moments, and if your kids have been immersed in violence to the point where they don't mind seeing a protagonist repeatedly blasted at by a shotgun-wielding old woman, then they will probably find this movie \\"enchanting\\" as others have.  It wasn't for us though.

055358894X|5.0|This book I easily rate 5 stars on the Amazon scale, but if it were possible, I would give Scott Lynch and this book a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5!!!    I am very picky and hard to please as an avid reader of fantasy, sci-fi, fiction, children's books, fairytales and more, and having read hundreds upon hundreds of fantasy books over the years, while I may not be a book reviews person (but I used to review movies online), I believe I am an expert on the area of fantasy, and I would liken Scott Lynch and this piece of work to greats such as Robert Jordan and his have to read \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, Steven Erickson and his wonderful series with amazing characters \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\", Rowling and \\"Harry Potter\\" (always fun), and even the great J.R.R. Tolkien and his amazing epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series and \\"The Hobbit\\" to!    Scott Lynch is I would say, an expert who has reached and accomplished the 3 things that I think a book needs to be a success. For a story/book/series to be a success the 3 things it needs to captivate readers and make them want more are: 1. a story (you didn't see that one coming did you!;) and I mean a good story, as unfortunately there are many works that are just blah in the story and are not really entralling. 2. Character, Great Characters! and 3. A great ending. Scott Lynch has all 3 of these things, and more, with a creative and fun story that is fantastical and a bit cheeky and a lot of fun! He has created really wonderful characters that you really have fun reading about and enjoy! He also has some little quips and great pieces of humor in there to. And with the end, let's just say the end is great, full of action and the entire story along with the end, has many twists and turns and the end is pretty darn good by Scott Lynch with his wonderful story!    I am just starting to read the sequel, \\"Red Seas Under Red Skies\\" and only a few pages in it already looks great and I am happily and very enthusiastically reading and will post a review of the sequel once finished, but for now anyone who loves a good, fun fantasy story and adventure, with great characters, lots of twists and turns and a great ending, check out \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" and you will not be disappointed!    And to Scott Lynch, thank you so much for the wonderful book and please keep them coming, I look forward to more!!!    James

1401902197|5.0|The first book I ever read by Louise Hay was \\"You Can Heal Your Life.\\"  And I loved how she used beautiful pictures and words to tell her story and to help others.  She's done it again with \\"I Can Do It.\\"<br /><br />In this latest book, she includes affirmations covering:<br />- Health<br />- Forgiveness<br />- Prosperity<br />- Creativity<br />- Relationships<br />- Job success<br />- Stress-free living<br />- Self-esteem<br /><br />One of my favorite affirmations from her book is, \\"I let go of all fear and doubt, and life becomes simple and easy for me.\\"<br /><br />Louise Hay is an amazingly positive person and by the time you finish her book, she'll have you saying, \\"I can do it,\\" too!
B000TEPF7K|5.0|Probably have purchased this recording 4 times in my life. A MUST HAVE...<br /><br />Sounds like the genesis of the My Life in The Bush Of Ghosts recording with David Byrne, or the Talking Heads, at times (which happened not long after, produced by B Eno) on King's Lead Hat....<br /><br />Phil Collins makes a couple appearances, doing excellent drumming.<br /><br />Mellow, sublime moments as well, (Here He Comes, Julie With...., The Spider and I) along with the Herky-Jerky tunes, which all were a major part of the Early Ambient Electronic movement.
B00011F5DK|5.0|[[ASIN:B00011F5DK Blokus Strategy Board Game]] We gave Blokus as gifts to families this season.  Blokus is a great family board game, easy to learn, fast moving, with plenty of strategy. No game is the same. Family members of all ages lined up to play at Grandma's during the holidays. I would highly recommend Blokus.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is one of the great racing movies. If you like Le Mans or Winning, or just love car movies,  this too is a must have. Once you've seen this though, you'll want the \\"making of\\" DVD too.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|My brother bought the DVD because he liked it so much, and insisted that i watch it too. I did today, and it was well spend time. It is a German movie based in East Berlin in 1984, which won a bunch of awards - deservedly i might add.     It is an excellent portrayal of how a repressive regime can shape people's psychology, whether they are of the oppressors or those against.  In 1984 the Stasi (GDR's secret police) had agents trained on how to spy the 'suspects' (anyone thought to not follow the regime's ideology) and how to extract information from them. Human psychology is shown to be a valuable tool in the hands of the agents, and so is their \\"research\\" on how to break down a suspect to talk.     The story follows Gerd Weisler (who actually reminds a lot of Inspector Finch character from V for Vendetta), a man who works for Stasi and is shown to be a loyal robot-like person with no life of his own, living by the rules. That changes when he is assigned to spy on a couple - Georg, a writer and his companion Christa-Maria, an actress. He seems to be discovering through them aspects of life, morality and relationships not known to him before, and against his previous beliefs. His transformation is very interesting to watch and at times i was not sure whether he would follow the Stasi code, or his own conscience; but that was true in a sense for all characters, as their actions were hard to predict. Acting is excellent, and so is the music, as well the literature/art references, which create a certain atmosphere for the audience to enter.     Yep, it is very relevant in our days, where surveillance is becoming accepted by the vast majority everywhere, without understanding where it can/would lead to, or without the knowledge that this has happened so many times in the past and will do again and again, until we learn to study history and learn from it.    This movie kept me on the edge of my sit - there's no dull or boring moment in it - and with tears on the edge ofmy eyes throughout. It gets 5 stars from me and i highly recommend it! :)
B000UJBYD8|4.0|bought this album last year after reading many reviews.I must say i am confused to what people were listining to. This completey rocks like any cult album.The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars ,was one completly different song that should have been left off.Other than that it great.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|In Rainbows....A brilliant beautiful, majestic record that every band hopes to create. The sounds are lucious, smooth, and pleasing to the ears and soul. Radiohead have outdone themselves, which isn't surprising concidering their past record, but this is bloody B R I L L I A N T. The opener, \\"15 Step\\" will have you dancing before you can even contemplate what you are doing. Everything about this record is stunning. Nothing compares to the beauty of \\"All I Need\\", and \\"Reckoner\\". I might sound like a fool, but there is nothing that could be any better than this fabulous piece of art. For anyone who truly apprieicates and wants to save the music industry, Radiohead are the salvagers and heroes out of the wreckage of mass populated waste that line the shelves. In Rainbows is the tightest, most hard driven record of the year of 2007 and it will still reign on the charts way into 2008. My favorite band has done it again, and will continue to amaze. Thom Yorke's voice will seep into your soul and make you feel a sense of calming, or just about whatever you want it to do. He is a brilliant musician, and the musicianship on this record proves such opinion.<br />Get this record and understand the feeling and emotion of a band that actually makes sense in this world nowadays. Love the Radiohead. LOVE.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is a great DVD/CD if you're a fan of classic down home blues. This is as basic as it gets. It's definitely not your normal Kenny Wayne so some may be dissapointed by it. It's great that a young musician pays tribute to the roots of the music he loves. I'm impressed!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is good to have in the DVD library. It can be viewed over and over, and still learn something.  The acting is memorable.  My husband could look at it many times, as he is an retired History teacher, and reads everything he can get his hands on, of the Second World War.
B00004W4UB|5.0|My Top 10 list has not changed in over a decade. Mary Reilly is totaly on my list. I was pretty dissapointed with the book, however, & would love to know where to buy or downloaad the script. Everything about this movie is so cool...great acting, appropriate lack of make-up, unresolved remonatic tension between Mary & Jekyl, unresolves sexual tension between Mary & Hyde, the costumes, the buildings, everything looks & sounds right for the time it's set in.
0446401307|5.0|I'm amazed and puzzled by the number of critical and tepid reviews this latest Harry Bosch novel has received here. Perhaps it isn't as good as the previous books in the series, but since I didn't know we were expected to keep score, I enjoyed it when I read it as it was serialized in the New Yawk Time Magazine and again when it appeared as a novelette. I suspect that the nay-sayers were merely not in the proper mood, because none of their critiques are very cogent.<br /><br />Certainly there are many faults and weaknesses that one could cite in Michael Connelly's writing. He is occasionally prone to lapse into purple prose - \\"A Darkness More Than Night\\"? [i]Woah! Duuude! You talkin' dark, huh?[/i] And the first sentence of this novel is the modern equivalent of \\"'Twas a dark and stormy night!\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, that whole maniac-serial-killer-plot vogue really peaked in the '80s, when every movie and every paperback was about a serial killer - as well as Serial Killer toothpaste and Serial Killer breakfast cereal. (It was a killer cereal!) So much so, that it must've seemed to those living in the civilized nations that every city in the USA had at least ten head of serial killers running around loose wreaking mayhem on Americans, and they were glad to be living in the relative safety of Bosnia. By the time Michael Connelly began writing about his serial killers, the whole device had become shopworn and hackneyed.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is, of course, Michael Connelly's most popular character, but in retrospect, the entire series is just [b]Michael Connelly writing the same novel over and over again![/b] They're all basically the same book because<br />1.) Harry Bosch has always just returned to duty after having been (wounded/suspended/prematurely retired/ held in abeyance while Michael Connelly's agents negotiated the movie rights).<br />2.) Before he can get rolling on the case, however, he is always confronted by his nemesis, (Captain/Deputy Chief/ former Chief) Irving Irving, who menaces Bosch with the threat, \\"You are going down this time, Detective! We are the Higher-Ups, and we, the evil Higher-Ups, are intent only on making things impossible for detectives!\\" The concept of the dastardly and meddlesome superiors in the chain of command - as well as the maverick cop - has likewise been done to death and became threadbare with the Dirty Harry movies.<br />3.) Unlike your grandmother, Bosch is still too stupid to use a simple search engine.<br />4.) In each novel, Bosch unexpectedly meets his old flame, beautiful (former/active) FBI agent (Eleanor Wish/Rachel Walling), and they promptly end up in (her/his) bed. Alas, the romance never works out, and by the end of the novel they once again go their separate ways, leaving Bosch, the loner, alone again, naturally. (Sigh!)<br />5.) Confounded in his efforts to apprehend the suspect, Bosch consults a psychic profiler, who - as with real-life profilers - spouts so much psycho-babble and dime-store analysis (that the female was stabbed 143 times with genital mutilation is cited as evidence of \\"hostility toward women\\" -  diagnosis: it's because the killer couldn't get a date to the prom), but this episode seldom offers any service in finding the real killer.<br />6.) On page (323 to 405) of each novel, the case takes an unexpected (90'/180') turn when it is revealed that the (pervert/slime-ball) Bosch has been chasing is in fact NOT the killer. Instead, it's always an inside job, and the culprit turns out to be a character who has been appearing on the periphery of the story all along. It always turns out that the (reporter/wife/dirty cop/dirty FBI agent) done it!<br />7.) The threat from the sinister Higher-Ups is realized, and Bosch is taken off the case. Disobedient as always, Bosch puts his career in jeopardy and strikes out on his own, and in doing so gets even (Edgar's/Rider's) disapproval.<br />8.) In his perilous chase after the (reporter/wife/dirty cop/dirty FBI agent) murderer, Bosch must crawl through a tunnel or hole (something Freudian going on there) while the insider-villain is shooting at him, and this brings back traumatic memories of his similar experience while serving in Vietnam.<br />9.) Bosch wins the gun battle, but now there's one more unexpected twist to be revealed - another peripheral character, the (reporter/wife/dirty cop/dirty FBI agent) is in on it too, and Bosch has to take (him/her) down as well, although this is done without gunplay.<br />10.) All the Higher-Ups are ungrateful that Bosch has stopped the serial killer, and they yet wish to persecute him, but by some lucky detail, he is allowed to keep his job.<br /><br />I suppose others could add to this list of similarities in all the novels, but follow that recipe, and you could write your own Harry Bosch thriller! It'd help, though, if you had the marvelous talent of Michael Connelly. None of the above should be taken as a dismissal or disparagement of these books, because not only have I read this novel/novella twice, I have reread every one of Michael Connelly's novels (the record being four times for \\"Angels Flight\\") - always at one sitting, not because the books are \\"impossible to put down,\\" but why would anyone want to put one down? What writer offers more reading pleasure than Michael Connelly? Perhaps finer novels have been written, but there is no other writer who has shown such consistent merit. More than anyone else, he's the Great American Novelist.<br /><br />Ignore the clich&eacute;s and formula! Michael Connelly has a superb ear for dialogue - equal to that of Elmore Leonard. Whatever their creative plots, other writers (e.g.,  Patricia Cornwell) produce stilted dialogue that you could never imagine having been spoken. There are also clever turns such as in this novel where Harry Bosch says, \\"That's exactly what I wanted to hear.\\" (The set-up having been placed two pages earlier.)<br /><br />And in Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly has sculpted the perfect American hero - the one man who fights for everyman, who fights for the forgotten man. Need I tell you that the whodunit facet of these books is of no significance? What's important here is the existential dilemma - one man versus an unjust and uncaring universe. What paladin can rescue us from the evil and woe of our poor circumstances? It is certainly not our masters and chiefs who have for centuries kept the spoils for themselves and worsened our helpless situation, and nowhere is this more evident than in the epitome of the pits, Los Angeles - where millions of primates are confined to struggle in a battle royale.

B000VR824S|5.0|If you're an Eric Clapton fan, a Blues guitar fan, or a live blues/70's rock/country music fan then this is the DVD for you. It is so good. I didn't like every single act, but I did like the majority and there's a LOT to pick from. Plus, I discovered quite a few musicians I'd never heard of which led to a bunch of new CDs I had to have. If you do buy this DVD, be sure to watch the extra stuff too, it's worth it! My only regret, where was I when this concert was announced? I only live 2 hours from where it was held!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|As the title for this review suggests, I absolutely loved this film. In fact, I really can't find much to criticize in it. It is highly accurate historically (with a few very minor exceptions - for example, I'm told that they were a little off in how long John Newton was a slave trader), has a very engaging and inspiring true-life story about a great Christian statesman, and was very well done artistically. This isn't your low-budget B movie that many associate with the Christian film genre; unlike films like \\"Left Behind,\\" the production values of this film are great (in fact, it was produced by one of the major Hollywood studios and has production values comparable to other major Hollywood films). To make a long story short, it has everything you could want from a truly great, possibly even classic, movie. The acting was great, the sets were great, the writing was great, the cinematography was great, and the editing and all the other technical aspects were right on target too.    My only minor complaint was I'm not sure I agree with how they portrayed John Newton. They portray him as being plagued by guilt about his past. I'm not sure if that was a historical reality that they had to portray or a decision they made about how to portray it.    With that said, I thought this was a wonderful movie. If you didn't catch it in theaters, you'll definitely want to see it on DVD.
0061544493|2.0|This book was   1. No duh fashion advice and   2. Blatently promoting her brand dVb.    I love fashion and I am not a snob about it, but this book provided no solid advice for me except to try out Elizabeth Arden's Eight-Hour Cream. One exerpt was \\"do not wear a white bra under a white shirt - it shows! Wear a nude bra instead.\\" Not sure about you ladies, but I have known this when I was 12 getting a training bra. It would have been a much better book if it wasn't meant for UK women and if it had more pictures/drawings of what is in style. Reading it simply does not do the trick. On the bright side, it is a fast and easy read.
B000001F9E|5.0|Thin Lizzy's 1976 album, Jailbreak, is not only the band's most successful album but also one of the best hard rock albums of the 1970's. Unfairly called a one-hit wonder by the majority of music fans for their now classic track \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\", Jailbreak proved that Thin Lizzy were anything but that.  Whether it's on a beautiful ballad, an intense rocker, or something in between, everything here is done with passion. Phil Lynott was one of the best songwriters in the genre and his vocals were always spot on, possessing plenty of soul and bite. Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson's guitar work was excellent and would prove influential to a newer generation of heavy metal bands. Brian Downey was a top notch drummer whose performance always matched the song's mood. The album truly is one long highlight as there's nothing even close to a bad or mediocre song here. \\"Running Back\\" and \\"Fight or Fall\\" are great ballads that never become sappy while \\"Angel from the Coast\\" and \\"Romeo and the Lonely Girl\\" are memorable story songs similar to what Bruce Springsteen used to write, only heavier. The tracks \\"Warriors\\", \\"Emerald\\", and the title song are great hard rockers full of menacing riffs. \\"Cowboy Song\\" would become one of the band's most cherished songs, most notably due to its guitar solo, one of many that Gorham and Robertson, would play in unison. Finally, \\"The Boys are Back in Town\\" is their signature song, still in regular rotation on AOR stations 30 years after its release. All told, Jailbreak is one of the best hard rock albums of the `70s and still doesn't fail to impress. Highest recommendation.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|The new digital transfer print of this classic sci-fi movie gives the movie a new life for another generation. Watching this gem you will be able to see the influence that it had on the directors of today, Riddley Scott, George Lucas, James Cameron & Steven Spielberg.<br />The extras are all worth watching, there are no \\"filler\\" special features that really aren't worth the bother. The clarity of the images printed on the tin box are amazing. All up, a definitive version well worth owning.<br />Note: My multi-region player had no problem with the region 1 enhanced coding.
1416523359|5.0|The first part of the book was a little hard to get into...like singing as song you don't know by just looking at the words. But once I got to feel of the pace I couldn't put this book down. I was sucked into the world of Lisey, Scott, and Manda. I kept reading cause I really felt in my soul that I WANTED to know what their world was like.    The \\"smucking\\" \\"bool\\" and \\"ra-chere\\" was in my opinion a glimpse at the intimate language of a couple. Every couple has an inner set of phrases and made up words. This added depth and realism to the story of the pair.     The fact that Manda's mental illness was much like that of Scott's was a little cliche but it did help the story out. I felt the story however could be possible.(Remember Ralph?) Strange things happen even in reality. So who's to say they can't happen in the fictional world.     I really loved the use of music as a means of telling the story and showing readers the world. But in my opinion...Lisey should have had the cops waiting on Dooley....although his ultimate fate did make me give a big \\"whoop whoop HURRAY!!!\\"    I loved this book and I'm gonna keep it for years to come. I might even take a trip to that pool that we all come to and drink, cast our nets, swim.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Finally this masterpiece is available in Region 1 DVD format.  Besides the various anti-science forces at work these days, there is a lot of bad science documentary being churned out.  So it's important for kids to see the high quality educational material, and The Ascent of Man is the best.  It is also beautifully filmed, a real work of art.    This piece was a reaction ot Civilization, the BBC's excellent documentary on art history.  Bronowski convinced them that they needed to have a history of science as well.
0439882826|5.0|I purchased one of these for my 8 year old grandson for Christmas and after receiving it I ordered another one for my 7 year old grandson.  Both of them said it was the best present they got and believe me they received some expensive items.  Star Wars seems to be very popular with a new generation of fans.   Needless to say I was #1 Grandma this year.  They thought the light sabers lighting up on last page was really cool.  This is really special so buy it your child will love it.
B000TYWAUA|4.0|I had to comment here, because some of the other reviewers got it completely wrong. This is a movie adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel, 300...thats right, a comic book! If you want a history lesson, the history channel has a great documentary on the subject. If you are into alternate history, graphicly intense action films, then I highly reccommend this. But please, if you are a history buff, please write a review on a non-fictional film...not a graphic novel made into a CG movie.
1416524800|4.0|After spending the fall semester reading textbook after textbook, I was ready to read something for fun. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down and finished it in 4 days.<br /><br />Brown's book is meant to be realistic but not ENTIRELY realistic. Thats why its called fiction. If a book can take you to another place and help you forget the real world for just one moment in time....its a good read. And thats exactly what this book did. From the moment I picked it up I was enthralled by its plot, characters, and the danger.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my step-father who was in the 101st during Vietnam. He feels a special attachment to the men in the movie much like these are his older warrior brothers.<br />Great movie at any price.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|Shakira fans already know they want this disc. Blu-ray Disc collectors can rest assured that this BD offers REFERENCE qualitiy 1080p video (appears to be 24p) that pushes the envelope of visible detail that can be captures in 1920 x 1080 pixels. There is both a 5.1 and 2.0 PCM 24-bit/48 kHz lossless soundtrack and a conventional Dolby 5.1 (640 kbps) soundtrack. The 5.1 PCM soundtrack cannot be beat. Incredible.
B000VWYJ8G|1.0|The cinematography in this film is laughable. It is filmed in such a manner that you are made to believe you are in the action...not a bad concept, however the execution here is awful. the screen is so violently unstable, it is near unwatchable. I actually did get a laugh noticing that in a situation where you would expect screen movement, there is none and vice versa. In an intimate moment between the two leads, the scene is shot from several angles including the closet, hall ect. The camera is shaking as if a child who ate too much sugar is holding a handheld, hiding in the closet. Conversely, a scene shot through a snipers scope (where you might expect a little screen movement) is so steady I did chuckle. The movie gets one star from me for some good fight sequences. My advice, spend your money elsewhere, or rent it if you loved the books.
0307341550|5.0|I'd like to know what the people who thought the characters or the book  boring usually read.  This book is utterly absorbing.  It is very dark, gruesome, graphic and even shocking.  A well-written book, there is quite a bit packed into  250 pages. I'll look forward to  her new book.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|This was an enjoyable movie to watch, but honestly, it lacked pace, action, and adventure.<br /><br />I bought this movie because of the cast, and they performed brilliantly as always. It's not the actor's fault the script was slow paced.<br /><br />I do recommend this movie to add to your collection. It's enjoyable, but not a blockbuster in my personal opinion.<br /><br />I give it a 3, right down the middle.<br /><br />Give it a shot, and judge for yourself.<br /><br />--James Michael Collins--
B000Y179KO|3.0|Was expecting great things on this CD, but a little disappointed.  Still the same Eagles, but the cuts are not especially memorable or outstanding.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|It's been awhile since the last Bond film was released, and I don't think I'm alone when I say that the Pierce Brosnan Bond films were poorly written, poorly acted, and all-around poor quality. Casino Royale is changing all that and reinvigorating what had become a flagging franchise. What we need is a Bond who is ruthless. We need a Bond who bleeds. We need a Bond who spends less time looking pretty and more time taking care of business. Enter Daniel Craig. Check. Check. And Check.<br /><br />With the introduction of Daniel Craig as Bond, we have entered  new era in the Bond franchise. These films have finally given us something to be afraid of--terrorism--and given us a hero who will not countenance our fear--he'll do something about it. A bomb maker is a bomb maker is a bomb maker to our new Bond and, rather than look at the big picture, he'll take them out one at a time. Then we'll take care of the big picture.<br /><br />This movie is visually stunning, entertaining, and gives me hope for the future of the Bond franchise. Whether this is your first or your fifteenth Bond film, you'll enjoy it and all it offers.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead- In Rainbows<br /><br />In Rainbows is the best album of 2007 and 2008. In 07, it ruled as an innovative download (in both marketing and sound) and in 08 it will be the top conventional release (I'm confident it won't be topped in the next 364 days). Radiohead delivers their best material since OK Computer while barely breaking a sweat. Don't be fooled: In Rainbows is not the minimalist record one might hear when taking it on its initial spin. There is nothing simple or plain about In Rainbows. The bass carries most of the tunes while guitars, synths and Thom Yorke's mesmerizing voice blend into an intoxicating brew.<br /><br />The complexity of this disc reveals itself during repeated listens. Rarely has a record rewarded a listener with more gifts of nuance and brilliance. The tenth listen trumps the first; the hundredth bests the tenth and so on. Yorke and company spin their web and once you're caught they won't let you go. I have heard it said that this is a boring, mid-tempo record. This is not true!  Imagine the beauty of Sigur Ros mixed with the minimalist art-rock of Can launched into an unknown future of what constitutes a song.<br />That, my friend, is what In Rainbows sounds like. And feels like. And looks like. Like layer upon layer of well, a rainbow.<br /><br />The first three songs best exemplify what it is Radiohead is trying to achieve. The opening track, \\"15Step\\", bounces along to synth riff while a desperate Thom pulls you into the void. \\"Bodysnatchers\\" is a stone cold rocker set in a place where guitars sound like chrome. Next up is \\"Nude\\": beautiful, haunting and seamless... And that's just the beginning! There is not a weak track in the bunch. You could ask ten listeners to name their favorite song on the disc and get ten answers. By the time the ninth tune, \\"Jigsaw falling into place\\" lifts you up and carries you away in a swirl of guitars, one thing becomes obvious: In Rainbows is a masterpiece. Run, don't walk to your nearest store or computer and buy or download this CD. The future is closer than you think...load this CD. The future is closer than you think...

0446528056|4.0|This was a great book like many of Sparks's books however the ending was just wrong. In a fairytale like this book I think that love should win. John spent his live waiting on this girl and she in return loved him jsut that same and I just wish it had a better ending for both of them. I feel like the book has left me hanging and I wish I knew what went on after she looked at the moon one last time.
B000W1V7K4|2.0|Even thought this film pretty new release this year, but the transfer is very bad in many scene especially in dark, the scene on the elevator is probably the worst scene i see in blu-ray full of grains and a lot of inconnect color display.  The sound is bad, are they kidding me no PCM or HD audio instead of crap dvd audio dolby 5.1  This is major film, how can they be lazy with the transfer.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|What a great concert,David Gilmour performs great Pink Floyd tracks as well as solo sides!!! There is also great guest stars too,David Crosby and Graham Nash provide(of course)some great harmonies,ex Soft Machine Robert Wyatt plays a beautiful Cornet(I never knew he could play a horn,I knew he played Keybords an percussion,but not horns, and does it so well being a parapalegic to boot!)solo,and legend David Bowie sings on a few numbers!!! This is one awesome concert!!! This 2 DVD set also has lots of extras to enjoy as well!!! A very well rounded out package!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way Up! Five stars!!! A+
0953104907|3.0|This book does have useful information and reference, but is not the 'Fantastic', 'Electric guitar bible', that it has been touted to be here and on luthier sites.  Book is organized logically, but it doesn't exactly flow, and even though some bits are humorous it doesn't make up for drab writing. Melvin is a great builder and does make nice guitars.    The book probably is worth the money for the first time builder, but not for  someone who has built one or two already.
0440238609|5.0|books arrived early and in perfect condition.  i recommend these to anyone who likes sifi/fantasy.  story is similar to The Chronicles of Narnia, even though Lewis was a professed Christian and Pullman is a professed atheist the stories have a similar feel to them.  All are told from the perspective of a young child as the main charter.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The BBC series \\"Planet Earth\\" is extraordinary!  With technological advances in photography, this series is able to show animals and insects as you have never seen them before.  I bought one set for each of our sons, as well as ourselves.

B0009UC810|5.0|I have always been a big fan.  Who knew that 2 comedians could be this good and entertaining?<br /><br />I love watching the movie!  Yes, it's ridiculous, campy, overboard, and pointless; but it is also entertaining, funny, heartwarming (trying to save the penguin) and action packed.<br /><br />It's one of the few musicals that I can sit through without skipping ANY of the songs.  I recommend getting the sound track and the Briefcase Full of Blues album as well.
B000002IPZ|4.0|This album is a must have if you are a Testament or a ThrashMetal fan! The title song is simply awesome and one of the best Metal songs ever!    This album has not been remastered but the soundquality is very good.     Buy this album now...      ...or wait for the remastered version :)
0393327655|2.0|Despite the appalling wrongness of this book, there is something rather appealing about Sam Harris. He is so sincere and full of good - well, good faith. It is surely a bizarre irony that his most attractive quality is the one thing he is trying to attack. But that is, apparently, the kind of guy Harris is: blisteringly sincere, surprisingly honest, and totally confused. Despite disagreeing totally with most of what he says, I feel that I would like him if I met him.     The problem he has set himself is to try to make sense of current events, particularly 9/11 and the terrorist problem generally. Unfortunately, his solution is no solution at all. And I'm sure that he has inklings of how wrongheaded it all is, despite his determination to see it through to the end.     He is clear in his own mind about what he believes: he thinks the greatest problem in the world is \\"unjustified belief\\", which leads people to do terrible things. But this only leads to the problem of defining what is unjustified, and ultimately all he can do is fall back on the usual non-explanation:  that anyone who believes anything different from what he believes is unjustified. What he believes, of course, is what he has grown up with: the typical grab bag of \\"liberal\\" attitudes and misunderstandings we have all seen a thousand times before. It is the same belief system that has been kicking around for the last 40 years, except that the liberals of that age would never have condemned Communism the way he does. At least he is honest enough to see that the problem with the Communists (and the Nazis) was that they passionately believed that what everyone else believed was wrong. His one blind spot is that he can't see how passionately he himself believes the same thing.    Of course he has no solution, other than the \\"end of faith\\" that he announces in his title. The way out of our current mess is for us all to stop believing, or at least to stop believing strongly; but since he can't even practicethat himself, how can he expect everyone else to do it?     It is simply in the nature of us humans to believe, and to act on our beliefs. The challenge for all of us is to make sure that our beliefs are true. Sam Harris obviously realizes this, but having made his stand on the \\"end of faith\\", he can only get himself into a mess.    Most of the details of this book are pretty forgettable. It is the same litany of accusation, without bothering to analyze the issues seriously, that characterizes the current wave of atheist literature. Except that Harris does not appear to suffer from the arrogance that characterizes the rest of the movement.    And that honesty of his keeps getting him into trouble. While the rest of the unbelievers are content to hold contradictory attitudes, he has a disturbing habit of looking a little more deeply into things and seeing at least some of the contradictions. His criticisms of relativism, pragmatism and pacifism are in fact excellent - well thought-out and completely logical. And I could scarcely believe it when I found him justifying George Bush! If he only keeps on with this habit of logical examination, he will probably work himself out of his confusion. He may even find himself becoming a Christian.
B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer is a masterpiece. The songs are great and the sound is great, what could possibly go wrong?    The best KISS album?      Maybe...
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I have had fear about this changes on the STOS; as I know it when I was young (I am 56 years old),but I find that this new presentations put the o.s. at the level of the rest of the saga. And if I want to see it in the past manner...well, no problem!, I bought the older DVD with the former versions.  I think this is a gift to all  fans. Thanks!. I am waiting for the other two  sesions.

B00007FOMP|5.0|If you are looking for the best album Marvin Gaye has made: this is it!  Each track is a gem and Marvin is at his best! Due to his lifestyle, the studiorecords are always preferable to the liverecorded albums. Every inch of his talent and qualities is to be found on this Motownalbum.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead has always strived to set themselves apart from the rest of the noise you hear these days. Over the years, they have come very, very far from their first release back in the early 90's and have since revolutionized the way music can be heard. After their Magnus Opus, 1997's OK Computer, their sound took a different route and everyone expected later albums to sound exactly the same or close to it. What the world got was a complete change, almost overnight, with 2000's Kid A and 2001's Amnesiac. During these years, their fanbase was polarized, but the band remained as an example of how far you can push the boundaries of sound and imagination. 2003's Hail to the Thief was a combination of their early work and their years of change. It was, at best, a decent effort from a band that was up to its neck with its record label. With the release of IN RAINBOWS, the band has brought out something different YET AGAIN. they have revolutionized the way fans praise the music and have done away with the pressure of having a record label breathe down their necks. the music sounds as if the band had fun writing the music and it is evident that they sound as if they are indeed IN RAINBOWS. Beautiful, enigmatic, challenging. Radiohead has indeed outdone themselves and have, once and for all, cemented their place in the Pantheon of Rock Legends.

B000K15VSA|5.0|This is home video history in the making. The definitive Blade Runner box-set. No one ever imagined that this film, which virtually made nothing at the box office, would become the most inspirational science-fiction film after its release in 1982. Those who have marveled at its incredible and breathtaking depth will agree that this box-set is A MUST OWN. Every cent invested in the box-set was worth its price. I don't need to say much more because the film HIGHLY speaks for itself, so if you're still deciding on which version to go with, invest your money in this one and I guarantee you will be incredibly satisfied, and then some!!!
B000OPOANE|5.0|I can't say how much I love this band here at amazon.com...<br /><br />For lack of much else to say, this album is another \\"must-have\\" for any RUSH fan out there.  The band's virtuosity is STILL unmatched!!!  And, they certainly show it off in Snakes and Arrows.<br /><br />This is another RUSH album added to my list of \\"music I will listen to until the day I die,\\"--that's how much I like it.  Grab the DVD--not the CD!!  96KHz, 24-bit makes a difference!!<br /><br />Other comments:<br /><br />If I was going to die tomorrow, I'd set foobar2k to Rush - 1974 - Rush - 01 - Finding My Way.flac, and keep my headphones on forever.
B00005JPFH|5.0|I bought this for my son as a Christmas present.  Although I didn't get to watch it with him, he was really excited and said that it was just what he wanted.  Thank you!
B000VBJEEG|3.0|My husband wanted to see this movie, so I bought it and figured it would make a cute movie to watch with our 3 and 5 yr old.  WRONG!  I've tried popping it in twice, and the kids have ZERO interest in watching it.  So far, this is the only movie they've had no interest in watching. It's a little long, and to be honest, a little boring.  I'd rent or borrow first before spending the money to see it.  Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo were much bigger hits with my crew (all get asked over and over again to be watched).
071563318X|4.0|A book for all those willing to make a stand against any impending zombie attacks.  Well thought out and presented with fool proof ways to avert your potential death.  I will survive.  YOU????

B000TGCR38|4.0|The Netherland's `Black Book' has many attributes on its \\"list\\".  Glossy cinematography, excellent acting, and fine direction lead a movie with the look and feel of a classic.  The best thing about the film, though, is its distinctive story.  \\"Inspired by true events,\\" director Paul Verhoeven gives us a unique survivor tale during The Holocaust.         Like many survivors, singer Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), flees the Gestapo by ferry with her companions.  While many are brutally shot and killed, she manages to survive.  With little time to conceal herself, she changes her identity to avert death.  Thinly and vulnerably hidden, she has an affair with a top Gestapo agent (Sebastian Koch) in (then called) Holland while keeping her ties to an underground resistance movement.  Moving tip-toe with her comrades, she experiences a horrible juggling act that entails too much deception to keep her safe on either side.    While I thought that the story and execution were totally absorbing, and van Houten's performance is enough to give Marion Cotillard ('La Vie en Rose`) a run for her money as best foreign actress, some of the tension lacks the worthiness of the tale.  When  Rachel plants a bugging device in The Gestapo office, I didn't feel the same nerve-wracking ambience of movies such as `Schindler's List' or `Army of Shadows,' (another Nazi resistance movie also based on true stories).   Also, the made-for-TV score didn't give the movie the emotional backdrop it deserved.    Despite a couple of flaws, 'Black Book' is a very worthy movie to put on your \\"list\\".
B000YXMMAE|4.0|Radiohead famously self-released its 7th studio album in October, 2007 via a name-the-price-yourself digital download, and now almost 3 months later comes the actual physical CD release. The way Radiohead went about this (one of the biggest bands in the world forgoing the major label structure completely) made as much news, if not more so, than the music itself. So hoes does the music actually stack up?<br /><br />\\"In Rainbows\\" (10 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with \\"15 Step\\", which for about a minute makes you think you're listening to more of Thom Yorke's brillian solo album \\"The Eraser\\", but then electric guitar crashes in, reminding you this is the full band. A bone-crushing \\"Bodysnatchers\\" follows, then giving way to \\"Nude\\", which is reminiscent of \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" from Kid A. \\"All I Need\\" caps off a very strong first half of the album. On the second half, the band turns more introvertly, quieter, check out \\"Faust Arp\\" with a beautiful acoustic guitar intro. \\"Reckoner\\" again reminds me of \\"The Eraser\\" sound. The album ends in a great 1-2 punch, the uptempo \\"Jigsaw Falling Into place\\" and the piano-driven ballad \\"Videotape\\".<br /><br />In all, \\"In Rainbows\\" is a return to the more traditional (if there is such a thing) Radiohead. Indeed, since the release of \\"OK Computer\\", the band has taken a number of sideroads: the brilliant experimental \\"Kid A\\" and its baffling and underwhelming companion album \\"Amnesiac\\", followed by the unfocused and sprawling \\"Hail to the Thief\\" have finally lead to \\"In Rainbows\\". I saw Radiohead headline Bonnaroo in June 2006, where they played several of the \\"In Rainbows\\" tracks. This album is further proof (to the extent that was still necessary) that Radiohead is one of the most important rock bands out there these days.<br /><br />(As an aside: the CD packaging comes with a do it yourself kit, including stickers, to make this into a proper CD jewel box release. Amazon has posted a hilarious short video on here that shows you how to properly assemble the CD box.)ble the CD box.)
0143038419|1.0|I was so excited to read this book after hearing good things and then seeing the author on Oprah. HOWEVER, shortly into the book I noticed a political reference that had no relevance to the particular point the author was making. It was a let down, but I moved on. Several pages later yet another political reference...this time much more critical and again totally lacking importance to the topic at hand. I couldn't help but drop the book to my lap, taking several minutes to decide whether I even wanted to continue reading. This is an excellent writer, she had me salivating at her brilliant style...till she had to infuse her political barbs (which I found insulting!). I don't care what her personal political beliefs are, just wish she would have kept them to herself! I read for PLEASURE...if I want to read about politics, I'll choose a book on that subject!
0143038419|4.0|I found Elizabeth Gilbert's narrative likable and unpretentious.  I was swept away by the sensuality of Italy, a bit bored with the India section, and found the Indonesia portion very gratifying.  It would be easy to develop a bit of an inferiority complex when reading about a woman who has traveled the globe as much as Ms. Gilbert has, but the way she reveals her own fears and weaknesses endeared me to her... her writing is very warm, and human.    Overall, I found the book difficult to put down except about halfway through the \\"India\\" section.  It got a little new-agey for a bit, and her descriptions of her spiritual practices felt repetitive, especially when they leaked into the \\"Indonesia\\" section.  But this is a small criticism of an overall intriguing read.    I was surprised to see the level of hatred some of the one-star reviewers have for Ms. Gilbert.  It doesn't even seem to be about the book necessarily, it's often aimed at HER personally.  I'm guessing this may be at least in part due to the growing cult of \\"Eat Pray Love\\" that was heavily featured on Oprah.  \\"Eat Pray Love\\" *parties*?  Dude.    In any case, what I liked most about the book was traveling with the author on her journey to become comfortable in her own skin.  It can take a lot of strength to combat those (often internal) voices that constantly say: \\"You can't... you SHOULDN'T... who do you think you are?\\"
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a superb work! the photography is amazing and one of the best presetations to help us who never get to the locations in the world that they captured and preserved for us. The extras that they included that go behind the scenes to show how they did their photography work is fascinating. The perspective on the thousands of creatures in some of the scenes is awe inspiring and a strong reminder of the vastness of God's creation on earth.    The final disk has a valuable role in helping us understand the seriousness of the environmental and species conditions developing around the world. It certainly should help overcome many skeptic's views that we are damaging the world that God gave us to care for and use wisely. Hopefully more of the viewers of this set will come to realize our need to do better at \\"Creation Care.\\"

B000YXMMAE|5.0|You should buy this album because it could change your life like it did mine. Buying 'In Rainbows' has been the single best decision I've ever made.  This album cured my depression, insomnia, and overeating of chocolate truffles.  Previous to buying it, I had only a few friends but now I have made many new friends.  It also solved my constant monetary difficulties. I even met a beautiful woman who I am planning one day soon to marry.  I've tried to change my life in the past by reading some of those hokey new-age books (like, e.g. 'The Secret', which seemed to me utterly pointless), but listening to Radiohead works a lot better.  Plus, the songs are absolutely incredible. Try it! You won't be disappointed...
B00005K3NR|4.0|Based on Stephen King's first novel, \\"Carrie\\" delivers on all levels. De Palma assembled a stellar cast to create the simple story of a small town high school girl blessed (and cursed) with telekentic powers. We immediately sense that Carrie is a sheltered, naive girl by the famous opening scene. Released in 1976, the opening scene also reminds viewers that girl's groom themselves quite differently today than they did 30 years ago.<br /><br />While Spacek is terrific as the troubled teen, it's Piper Laurie who gives the biggest chills as her fanatical mother. \\"Dirty Pillows!\\" she bellows. Mama was apparently dumped by her husband, and has turned to the Bible to assuage her misery. The only problem is, she tries to take her daughter along for the ride. If Mama can't have any fun, neither can her sinful daughter. Of course, Carrie just wants to be accepted by her peers. She's not pretty, and is unbearably shy, so it's no surprise that she's shocked to be asked to the prom by \\"the most popular boy in school,\\" Tommy Ross (played by William Katt--The Greatest American Hero).<br /><br />What happens at the prom (back when prom's were held in gymnasiums and not banquet halls), is the stuff of legend. Like Carrie, you'll never forget the prank, and we can only cheer on the little psycho as she systematically exacts her revenge. John Travolta (fresh from his stint as one of the sweathogs on \\"Welcome Back Kotter\\"), makes a cameo in his first theatrical feature. Amy Irving plays the guilty teen who tries to help Carrie, and ultimately provides viewers with a shocking ending that really grabs you. \\"Carrie\\" will no doubt continue to thrill a new generation. Of course, they've already tried to remake this for television, once again trying to improve upon the wheel for a bit of pocket change. Skip the television remake, especially if you want to hear the echoing words of Carrie's mother in your head, \\"They're all going to laugh at you!\\"

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|This book is a page-turner and very well-written (for readers who demand good prose as well as a griping story), but I have to warn you that it isn't for the squeamish. This is among the few books I'm actually embarrassed to admit I read -- and every word.<br /><br />The title character, Dexter, is a psychopath and serial killer who treats the reader to a first-person narrative of his crimes. There's enough macabre humor to permit the reader to tell herself that it's OK to get deeply involved in the story. The author, Lindsay, also manages to convey a sense that a psychopath is detached from humanity -- feeling no emotions, godlike, swatting flies when he kills -- so the reader can pretend the book takes the moral high ground.<br /><br />That said, the book glamorizes carnage, even though I suspect Lindsay tried very hard to avoid doing this. Yes, even the anti-hero narrator knows that he's a very sick person. Unfortunately, he justifies his crimes to himself and his audience: Dexter piously claims only to target serial killers more evil than he himself is -- except that occasionally he has an uncontrollable urge to kill someone else. In this case, he targets a woman whose crime is stupidity (granted, that's a crime) and ambition: his step-sister's rival on the police force. She proves her stupidity when she can't figure out who the killer is and then wears high heels in the final chase scene. Yup, I guess that makes it OK to chop her to pieces.<br /><br />So, I probably won't read another Dexter novel, unless it's the only readable thing in the airport bookstore. But I did find this book fascinating.
B00005JOHC|5.0|It's funny, witty, a bit sexist sometimes because it's primarily from 2 middle-aged mens' point of views. I love Charlie's charismatic yet nonchalant approach to life and how much he gets off picking on his younger, less-experienced-in-sex brother.<br /><br />His brother is cool too. They're both laidback, yet his bro is by far the smarter of the two. He's divorced and overly-content with his standings.

B000U7169M|5.0|Well, maybe not.But the fun in this film is that it takes a standard idea in horror(child with supernatural abilities) and mixes in some regulars like the town that is not what it seems, and adds a \\"much older\\" prophecy that is telegraphed to a Priest by fiery edits of his photo collection.  The Characters are developed well, and  the story is layed out very carefully  until the climactic end, which also leaves a sufficient amount hanging to allow for a sequel.I had been waiting to buy this item, and I have not been disappointed, good watch, very good audio 5.1 mix.Also, it emerges in the extras that this film was one of a number that were affected by Cyclone Katrina ( I had thought SKELETON KEY was a similar one, but I think it was pre-Katrina).    The DVD is unfortunately a double sided disc, which is a format that has its own problems in many DVD players ,so I hope they fix that in later releases.The small number of extra material is nice, but this might have benefited from a track commentary.
0064430227|5.0|This book presents an excellent opportunity to use during guided reading for grades 1st-3rd.  Students are able to relate to the character and understanding that by using our creativity and strategic plans we can have fun and accomplish many things.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|At the end of Disc one, the so called Bon Scott Era Disc, Bon is talking about how they write and basically, the more they toured, the more they wrote and recorded; Well, an Eerie comment to make in a period not that long before his passing, but one that seems to show the way the ACDC formula worked.  Through a Mixed bag of Very Good Quality Video to some not so great Quality video, that still sounds awesome.This is more of a full on, warts and all ACDC-ology instead of the somewhat Sanitized KISSOLOGY series( and yes I have all three of those, and Yes I am a KISS fan, but more of the Original lineup)... anyways, I just mention that for comparison purposes, which is basically, KISS talk about pleasing the fans, where-as ACDC very much lived this Ethos ( and if you have heard the story behind \\"A WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE\\" then pleasing the fans assumes a whole different level there).  The 3 disc set is definitely the way to go, as good as disc one and two are, the added items like the variation on the Angus Stutue animation on disc 3 is a great watch ( you will know what I am talking about if you have the 2002 Live in Munich concert that has a superb version of the Angus Statue going through Munich, also if you saw that tour with the Statue and what it could do, this will be a big plus as well).  Anyways, all I missed was BIG GUN. And whilst I think about it, the track with Angus and Malcolm on stage with the Stones playing a Song is a wow... ;the Gibson  , GS I think, looks almost bigger than Angus's upper Body; how he played that thing I don't know, but he cruises and \\"Blues-es\\" his way with the Stones as only Angus can.  Wins my vote !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Just a few notes on the Quality of the DVD Pack presentation: its fabulous.The design is so obviously for the fan and the collector that they deserve full marks on this set. Few Packs have this kind of quality. You may want to laminate the extras in the inserts as well as the poster, alternatively buy an additional copy. I know that with the KISS Orchestra Pack, I bought a second copy because the package was not good quality, and the Sabbath 2 disc set Collection with the Guitar Pick ( so called Digipak) needs some care taken with it. The ACDC pack is built to take repeated opening and closings, basically made for regular use, like the EDDIE'S  ARCHIVES, and for those who recall it,  the  EDDIEs  HEAD  pack released in the 90s was a good idea but poorly presented, however the discs inside were the best of the Beast. The point of what I am saying is that few bands take care with special releases that fans like, and ACDC  have done PLUG ME IN as a great pack.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This movie is very good in that it was funny and romantic just like it was meant to be.  The only mistake was in casting Jack Black for the part he played.  He was the only actor who was not funny.  He needed to be taller, thinner and not have a comedian's face.  Sorry Jack this was just not for you!
B000V4UFZK|3.0|Documentaries of real Poltergeists and Hauntings, don't want it. Yeah, we get a full featured \\"Real World of Poltergeists\\" included with this special edition, but who is Warner Brothers kidding here? This is not Unsolved Mysteries, this is a classic movie. Where is the making? Where is the story of the poltergiest curse which includes death of cast members and some poeple in involed with the movie? Where is the story of Heather O Rourke's sudden death? Where is the controverisal heated story between the director Tobe Hooper and producer Spielberg?  You're not going to get anything about it. No cast interviews, no storylines about the movie's infancy,  nothing about the making of the movie, just another decent documentary about hauntings and poltergesits and contacting the dead which has nothing to do with the movie itself. In all seriousness, there is nothing wrong with the documentary included with the film, but it just doesn't belong here.     As for the movie itself, we know how awesome it is, and yes, it does look like it's been cleaned up quite a bit. Boasting it being digitally restored and remastered it probably true. It's defintely the best looking poltergeist I've ever seen on my TV. The audio even seemed to get an upgrade too. As fans know, this came out 25 years ago in 1982, wow, has it been that long, but amazingly, it has still withstood the test of time as is still considered to be one of the best movies ever made. I personally believe the movie is Spielberg's best, more than E.T., Close Encounters, you name it, Poltergeist is probalby his best work. While Tobe Hooper takes credit for being the director, that's where the controversy starts between Hooper and Spielberg. And I can honestly that's why WB has ignored a full fledged making of the movie knowing the controversy it may spawn between Hooper and Spielberg. But even without the interviews or making of the movie, if you haven't bought this movie yet, now is probably a good time, just don't expectany good extras that have anything to do with the movie.
1427201439|5.0|Undoubtly, Frank Herbert's DUNE is an undisputed science fiction classic. A masterly crafted tale of adventure combining romance, politics, religion, ecology, intrigue, and space opera into a grand epic. At 22 hours on 18 discs, it might seem a bit long, but you owe it to youself to get this if you like the book. Excellant narrators, accompanied by an accomplished cast transport the listener to the exotic world of Arrakis and all the adventure within. Besides...ever tried to read a book on a bicycle?
B000W4HJ44|5.0|If you never thought joy could be translated into filmic form, then you haven't seen this movie! You can't help but smile & hug yourself by the time it's done & then you just want to watch it over again.  Movie musical fans, rejoice!  This flick's for you!
140120306X|5.0|What an end ! this book may be the final chapter of the League of extraordinary gentlemen and also the final chapter of Alan Moore's writing in mainstream comics, so... he put everything he could into it : tons of literary references, mature contents, parody, satire, in a word : extravaganza, both in the story and in the form of the story.  Certainly an UFO in comics today, maybe a masterpiece, anyway a must have for all those who claim to be comics readers (even if several readings are highly recommended)
B00005JPTI|4.0|This is not a cheesy vampire/zombie flick.  I found it to be a thought provoking and frankly a frightening `what if' movie.<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\", is loosely based on Richard Matheson's 1954 short story of the same name.  Most of earth's population has perished due to a plague caused by a manmade virus, originally intended to cure cancer.  This manmade horror kills the majority of what it infects and what it doesn't kill it turns into devolved humanoids that roam the streets at night and feed on the uninfected.<br /><br />Will we outsmart ourselves right into extinction? Will Smith plays Lt. Col. Robert Neville, a military scientist who is immune to the virus, hunting for a cure, and slowly being driven mad by loneliness and frustration.<br /><br />Will Smith's performance was riveting and left me wondering how a person might cope when faced with the realization that you are quite possibly the last intelligent human left on earth. Overall, this movie was more than worth the price of admission.  It doesn't rely on over the top CGI effects; it relies on an intelligent audience allowing themselves to get caught up in the story.
B000VR824S|5.0|Claptons \\"CROSSROADS\\" is one of the best live albums I have ever heard. It's like being there with out the crowd. Just great and I recommend it to all Jass, Rock and Classic Rock fans.
B000Y44LBG|4.0|I just loved this movie...a non-stop action movie that does what most movies are incapable of...makes you care about the characters. You learn just enough about the characters so as not to get burdened with details...you either love them or hate them....this cast along with the director just work! You truly can't go wrong with Washington...he is a remarkable actor....throw in Crow on top of that and you have the perfect cast for this based on life action packed thriller. I highly recommend...your dollar won't be wasted on this one.
B000NA28I4|2.0|Chris Paolini, with author of the book that the film \\"Eragon\\" is based on, was only 15-years old when he began writing his fantasy fable.  While the age at which he wrote it is remarkable, the end product is predictable from someone that age.  It is a very shallow and derivative story that translates to an unsatisfying movie experience.    \\"Eragon\\" tells the tale of a young boy, the titular Eragon (Ed Speleers), who comes into the possession of a magical dragon egg that hatches to become Saphira, the blue dragon.  With the help of Saphira and a former dragon-rider named Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon seeks to avenge his father's death and defeat the evil forces of Galbatorix (John Malkovich).      The tale is as old as literary time and it has found itself manifested in such phenomenal tales as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.  So, while the tale is nothing original, a new angle on its telling can still make it memorable.      Alas, \\"Eragon\\" fails in that regard.  This story is merely generic retelling with very unremarkable characters and adventures.  It is unfortunate that this film should be this way, but is it simply a product of an unpolished scribe (Paolini) whose work I'm not certain most directors could make into something compelling.
0060555661|5.0|If you want to consistently make money, this is the book to read. Amazing book.
B000O7EJZ6|4.0|The Beatles' \\"White Album\\" (1968) marks the beginning of their solo careers - evidenced by tracks such as Lennon's \\"Julia,\\" McCartney's \\"Blackbird,\\" Harrison's \\"Long, Long, Long\\" and Starr's countrified \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\" Nevertheless, the group rocks harder than ever with \\"Birthday,\\" \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\" and the heavy-metal precursor \\"Helter Skelter.\\" The throwaways are relatively few (\\"Wild Honey Pie\\"), but John & Yoko's experimental \\"Revolution 9\\" belongs on another album. Too bad there wasn't room for George's \\"Not Guilty\\" and his acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" Regardless of its flaws, \\"The White Album\\" is a remarkably diverse collection. A special nod to Paul's unlisted (and unpublished) \\"Can You Take Me Back?\\"
B000YMBBH0|5.0|I bought this before Christmas for $50. At that price its like a \\"Buy 2 Get 1 Free Offer.\\" All 3 are great movies. Usually when it comes to sequals, or trilogy's, the movies seem to trail off after the first one. In my opinion, each one of these gets better and better.     One other thing, this set got a few 1's from buyers that bought this and don't have a HD DVD player. If you don't have a HD DVD Player don't buy this, it won't play. If you are buying a HD DVD player for your HD set,or have one already, this trilogy is a great way to start. All 3 movies get top marks for HD Video Quality & Sound
1582701709|2.0|If one were to sum \\"The Secret\\" in a single sentence it will look like this: \\"What you think and what you believe, is what you get. Always.\\"    This idea, of-course, has some truth in it. But the naive treatment that \\"The Secret\\" gives this idea is simply laughable. The book describes the world as genie who's ready to fulfill your every whim. No matter what the whim is. No matter what the material and/or moral and/or philosophical limitations of reality.    Does it really work that way? Of-course not. How many times have we heard of some poor gulliable fellow who lost all his money in a scam he truly *believed* in? Or of people who died after drinking poison which they truly *believed* was juice or water? Our thoughts and beliefs are certainly part of the equation, but they aren't the whole story.     What's really missing in this book, is an explanation of the other side of the coin. When you truly believe in something and still fail to achieve it, what should you do? Believe harder? Or perhaps you should back up a little and try to understand why you failed? Yet \\"The Secret\\" doesn't address these complications. It doesn't even acknowledge that they exist at all.     At this point you might wonder why I didn't give this book one star. I ask myself the same thing... Quality-wise, the book certainly deserves it. But I did find some of the quotes in there, and it is still standing on my bookshelf. So a one-star rating from me would be a little unfair.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Martin Scorsese's fascination with America's crime scene examines low-life in Las Vegas in Casino.  Though long, this movie remains one of The Master's less heralded production, and I can't figure out why.    Robert DiNiro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci all put in admirable performances.  For me, it is impossible to delineate whose is superior.  DiNiro's eastern cowboy, Stone's addicted, insecure hustler, and Pesci's violent punk all shine with acing eloquence and nuance.    The picture is pretty -- there's no other way to say it.  And, as always, Scorsese's use of contenmporary music creates a soundtrack that tells a part of the story by itself.    This gem has been polished up in this presentation to the point that it shines like it was meant to.  The seventies never looked so good.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|\\"Forget the hype. Forget the hoopla. Forget the format. Forget what you want it to sound like. Just listen to the music and decide for yourself.\\" This is what I told myself when I downloaded Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows\\" in the early hours of October 10, 2007. I told myself this to avoid any disappointments that I may have incurred from having preconceived notions. It didn't work. After 4 years of waiting for a new Radiohead album (the longest stretch the band has ever had between albums), I was ready for something amazing. What Radiohead has delivered isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it is Radiohead, and it is good. For that, I can't help but be happy with my experience with \\"In Rainbows,\\" even if I'm a bit disappointed that it's not as amazing as I would have hoped.<br /><br />I don't consider myself to be a hardcore Radiohead fan and I say this only after meeting people who do. I'm more of a moderate fan, myself. I believe \\"Kid A\\" to be their best album and \\"Paranoid Android\\" is my favorite song ever written, but I don't go scouring the net every day looking for the latest Radiohead news and such. I think Dead Air Space is unnecessary and pretty lame for the most part and I can't understand why people actually read it. And I think that Radiohead is absolutely at their best when they are pushing musical boundaries and forcing us to rethink our notions about rock music; what it is and what it can be. That's the Radiohead that I enjoy listening to the most, but unfortunately that's not the Radiohead on \\"In Rainbows.\\"<br /><br />For what is probably the first time in their career (not counting \\"Amnesiac\\"), Radiohead shows very little progression from their most previous album, and are hardly expanding upon their sound. \\"15 Step\\" is probably the most progressive that the band sounds on the album, heavily featuring an unrelenting hip-hop beat and a ridiculous bass line that underscores Thom's vocals perfectly. The shouts of children can be heard occasionally in the background, and is a nice touch that most casual listeners will unfortunately miss. \\"Bodysnatchers\\" is another fantastic song, and it's probably the hardest that Radiohead has rocked since \\"The Bends.\\" Thom's vocals are absolutely insane here, too, especially towards the track's end. It may very well be my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />Both \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Faust Arp\\" hearken back to an earlier pre-Kid A Radiohead sound. While hearing Thom sing something as soft as \\"You are all I need, you are all I need\\" may be a bit jarring at first, by the time the song comes to a close he's totally redeemed himself. \\"Faust Arp\\" is even better. A largely acoustic song with crooning strings and Thom's subtle but excellent vocals, it serves as a sort of midway breather, if you will. However, dismissing it as such would be a terrible oversight. \\"Reckoner\\" features some excellent production (listen to it with a good pair of headphones) but is generally unaffecting and, dare I say, boring. The instrumentation is mostly stale throughout the song and Thom's melody is downright repetitive and easy. It's a definitely low point on the album.<br /><br />\\"House of Cards\\" scores another point for the quality team though. It's infectious guitars are complemented beautifully by Thom's vocals and some truly excellent peripheral noise. It runs head on into \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place,\\" the album's first upbeat track in a while. It has an unavoidable groove to it, led largely by persistent drum and vocal lines. It's one of \\"In Rainbow's\\" more exciting tracks, not just because it is faster, but because the band really clicks on it. Again, the production value here is through the roof. \\"Videotape\\" ends the album beautifully, in classic Radiohead form. The song has been getting a lot of criticism from the hardcore fans because it sounds a bit different than it did when it debuted, but I've found it to be a worthy closer to the album. While the drums can get a bit distracting at times, everything else is virtually without flaw, and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />A lot of fuss has been made about how Radiohead has decided to release \\"In Rainbows.\\" For what it's worth, I think they are geniuses for choosing to release the album online, not because I want the RIAA to burn (I do) or because I hate paying for music (I don't), but because \\"In Rainbows\\" is probably Radiohead's most accessible album since \\"Pablo Honey\\" and this may be the only way that a non-fan would be willing to give the band a listen. Despite it's lack of inventiveness, \\"In Rainbows\\" is still the best Radiohead album since \\"Kid A\\" and a marvelous example of what a talented band can do when given a little time and freedom. Though I may be disappointed at it's less than groundbreaking approach, I am more than happy with what I have been presented with. The fact that I didn't have to pay for it is just a bonus (I'll buy the hard copy when it's released in '08).<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Radiohead and anyone who wants one of 2007's better albums!<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"15 Step\\"<br />2. \\"Bodysnatchers\\"<br />3. \\"Faust Arp\\"<br />4. \\"House of Cards\\"<br />5. \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\"<br /><br />7 out of 10 Starsnd I couldn't be happier.

0440418569|3.0|Despite Pullman's never subtle dislike of Christianity, I find these books compelling.  Pullman is a wonderful writer, gifted with language.  I managed to swallow his anti-Christian rhetoric because of his writing skill and because his critique of Christianity stands on the very worldview it attacks.    That said, I was weary of the evermore explicit anti-religious diatribes by the end of this final book.  The characters make little speeches about the perils of authority, the evils of the Church, the \\"mistake\\" of Christianity, and the need for a Republic of Heaven instead of a Kingdom of Heaven.  The story could've ended with a bang but trickled on needlessly into the whimpers of adolescent love.  On the whole, however, the trilogy has strengths which manage to outweigh these weaknesses.  A thoughtful and open-minded reader (exactly what Pullman claims to want) should manage to enjoy a good story while discovering the Christian truth Pullman unwittingly voices.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|I love Zombie's music, I really do. (My mother's still praying for me.) I hav to say, I wish I'd never bought this album. Some of the songs are OK, not Zombie's best, but still OK. The ones that aren't OK remind me of a hair band flashback. They don't even sound like Zombie. Overall, the songs are forgetable, nothing there will stick with the listener after the CD's been put back in it's case, nothing here I want taking up space on my iPod, nothing destined for a future \\"best of\\" album. My advice would be to skip this one, it's just not worth the money.

B000WQW988|5.0|Never in any other nirvana mercandise, can you get such raw emotion from this timeless and amazing band. You can see by every body movement how nervous Kurt Cobain was on this very night. Its such, in a way, a very emotional and beautiful thing to watch. I have never felt so in touch with any band until I watched this. It makes you feel like you are there, back in 1993 just watching him goof around and be real. It shows him and the band in the most raw footage ever. Every facial expression, every word, every comment... its just Kurt through and through. I nearly cried, and believe me I'm not one to show emotion. But, for a moment it felt as if he was still alive I guess... I always wished I could have met him or gone to one of his concerts. And now with this dvd I can experience the true Nirvana experience anytime I want. There is nothing I could say that would in anyway be a critic of this dvd. It is Nirvana in its perfection. The way you remebered them, the way you always will. This truely does the band every bit of justice that they deserve. I swear I have watched it several times within the last few day in amazement, of course driving my fam crazy...lol. I fell in love with the band all over. That is amazing. If you wern't a Nirvana fan before, you will be now. And if you are still not, then your just messed up in the head like that *&$%*# who killed him.
6304698798|5.0|The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is not only the penultimate of Sergio Leone's Western trilogy, it is a masterwork larger than the genre itself.<br />Technically brilliant, the film paints a legendary tale of three forces in human nature depicted by three outlaws. Set before the back drop of the Western Cival War, the characters pass through the lives and deaths of the people they meet leaving their signiture influences and impressions. Very few movies capture the irony and futility of human greed, ambition, and folly while still holding out hope as cryptically and successfully as this Western.
B000002JEV|5.0|Which should you buy? Both, but if it must be one, I recommend How the West Was Won. The biggest reason is sound quality. How the West Was Won has fantastic sound quality - the best of any Zeppelin album, whereas BBC Sessions seems average or below average, worse than the studio recordings. This opinion seems to be contrary to most of the reviewers here, and I certainly know nothing about mixing recordings, but to my ears the HtWWW sound is much fuller, more alive, and better differentiated than BBC. In terms of musical performance, leaving aside sound quality, I love both albums, but again I would pick HtWWW first.    The first CD of BBC Sessions is early Zeppelin (1969), and very bluesy. This stuff is great, especially Something Else, Travelling Riverside Blues, and both versions of I Can't Quit You Baby. If you love the early blues side of Zeppelin most, this is the CD for you. HtWWW has much less of that, although it does have some - obviously including Since I've Been Loving You and the Whole Lotta Love medley.    The second CD of BBC Sessions is from a 1971 concert. All the songs on it, except Thank You, are also performed in the 1972 concert recorded as HtWWW. Thank You is a truly great song, and its ommision from HtWWW is unfortunate, but on the other hand HtWWW contains several tracks not on BBC CD2 (some are from Houses of the Holy, which did not exist at the time). All these songs are great (HtWWW does not contain a bad track), but especially Over the Hills and Far Away, Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, The Ocean, and Bring it On Home. If you are looking for more classic live songs from Zeppelin at their absolute best, HtWWW is the album for you.    A brief comparison of some of the best songs that are on both BBC Sessions and HtWWW with the studio versions:    Stairway to Heaven:  HtWWW version is better than both BBC and the studio version, BY FAR. Plant's voice on the HtWWW version is fantastic, including all the asides he makes throughout (\\"Wait a minute..\\", \\"Remember laughter?\\", etc). Page's guitar on the the HtWWW version is perfect (and longer than the BBC and studio versions). Perhaps the best performance for each of them I've ever heard on any song. The BBC version is great. Both versions prove that this song deserves every accolade it gets, but I like the HtWWW version better.    Going to California:  Again, I prefer the HtWWW version. It is extended, with extra guitar work between the verses, and it is lovely. The BBC version is also great, and I think both are better than the studio version. Plant's performance in the BBC version might be better than HtWWW, but the extended guitar makes up for it.    That's the Way:  I prefer the BBC version. It is a bit simpler than the HtWWW version, and in this case that is better. Great stuff. Again, both better than the studio version.    Whole Lotta Love medley:  HtWWW is longer, and I prefer the songs in the medley, especially Hello Mary Lou. Both BBC and HtWWW are great, but HtWWW is again better.    Dazed and Confused:  I like the BBC version more. The violin bow playing is gentler on my ears than in HtWWW :). Very cool.    To summarize, BBC Sessions is a very good CD. It is especially fun to notice how Zeppelin tweaked the songs and lyrics. However, How the West Was Won is BRILLIANT.
0374105235|5.0|I heard Ishmael being interviewed on the radio and was so impressed with his eloquence, I knew I had to read his story.  It is honest, sad, and inspiring.  I felt like an ignorant American, not knowing that lives were and are being lived in such conditions.  I have been catching up on world events ever since reading \\"a long way gone\\".  I'd like to use the book in my junior high reading classes.  It is an eye opener just as the classic \\"Diary of a Young Girl\\".
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Dire Straits is a band that would form in the late 1970s.  Throughout their career, Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place.   In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.  In latter years, Dire Straits would migrate toward more complex and progressive arrangements and somewhere along the way they would become pop stars.   However, the early days of Dire Straits would demonstrate their roots around Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and Country.    This was demonstrated on their self-titled \\"Dire Straits\\" which showed a simpler, more-stripped down sound than what they would eventually become known for.  The follow-up album, \\"Communique\\" would continue this sound but focus much more around a County and Folk sound.   Some consider \\"Communique\\" the weak point of the Dire Straits catalog, but I think there is plenty of good music on this album.    For the most part, Dire Straits is the brainchild of its lead guitarist and vocalist - Mark Knopfler.   Throughout his career, Knopfler would assemble a group of musicians that would comprise Dire Straits.   Like on their debut album, \\"Communique\\" consisted of Mark Knopfler on vocals and lead guitars,  his brother David - also on guitars, John Illsley (who would be the only constant throughout the life of Dire Straits besides Mark Knopfler) on bass, and Pick Withers on drums.   On latter albums, Dire Straits would demonstrate more use of the keyboards (for example Roy Bittan would add a new dimension by playing keyboards on the \\"Making Movies\\" album), but as on the self-titled \\"Dire Straits\\" album, \\"Communique\\" would continue to focus around a guitar-oriented sound.  \\"Communique\\" is not a hard-Rocking collection and will have more of a soft feel, yet this still is a very good collection.    As for the lyrics,Mark Knopfler does some of his best songwriting on this collection.  I like how he makes use of metaphors and storytelling.     Here is a track by track review of this collection:    \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" This song demonstrates two themes on this album....the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" demonstrates the storytelling capabilities while \\"West\\" demonstrates the Country-Western feel. The guitar work is going to be the signature of this song - highlighted by the \\"twanging\\" sound that is heard throughout this collection.    \\"News\\":  Similar feel to this song as \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\".   This song combines storytelling with the Country-Western feel of the guitar.  I particularly liked the instrumental ending to this song - which is highlighted by some haunting drums by Pick Withers.    \\"Where Do You Think You're Going?\\": This is one of the stronger songs of the collection.  Instead of sung as a story, this one is song from Mark Knopfler's point of view.   The guitar strings sound three dimensional as they provide another Country-like feel.   The ending of the song has a great guitar jam.    \\"Communique\\":  This song starts with a strong Country-like feel to it.   This song took a few listens for me to get into, but after a few listens, it definitely is worthy of a title track.   I particularly like how the vocals \\"slow down\\" right at the end of each chorus with \\"Communique\\".    \\"Lady Writer\\": This song picks up the tempo and is one of the earliest of examples of Dire Straits pulling off a faster tempo song.   The result is the album's strongest track and one that stands up with the best of Dire Straits' tracks.   Still the Country-like guitar feel is prevalent throughout this track.  There are some also nice background vocals on this track.    \\"Angel of Mercy\\": Here is another track that highlights the Country-Western like guitars by Dire Straits.  Here is another track that took a few listens before I got into it.   Once again, this song is highlighted by some good background vocals by the band.    \\"Portobello Belle\\":  Same story here....more guitar-laden instrumentals with a Country like feel to the melody.  This song also has a storytelling feel, but this time from Knopfler's point of view.   The chorus is subtle, but very effective.   This is one song where Dire Straits highlights the use of keyboards.      \\"Single Handed Sailor\\": This song maintains the Country feel to it, however this song is going to contain some outstanding guitar riffs.   The end result will not only be a very catchy melody, but a very good song.  I particularly liked the instrumental about 2/3 into the track that will wind things up. The song also follows a storytelling pattern.  I've heard many call this one of Dire Straits' most underrated songs - I couldn't agree more.      \\"Follow Me Home\\":   This song opens with the sounds of ocean waves.  These waves segue into some very gentle guitar sounds (with the Country-like \\"twang\\" that is found on so many of these tracks).   The vocals don't start until about just a little under two minutes into this track.   I actually found this the collection's weakest track, but it still isn't a bad track.    The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to it.   Overall, this album demonstrates the songwriting, vocal, and guitar talents of Mark Knopfler.  It also demonstrates the musicianship for the rest of the band.   This album does a nice job in expanding on the foundation that was established on the self-titled \\"Dire Straits\\" album.   On this album, you can understand why it wasn't so unusual for Mark Knopfler to record with EmmyLou Harris.   .Yes, Dire Straits have recorded stronger albums, but this album still does a very good job at holding their own.  Highly recommended.
038572179X|5.0|I really enjoyed the read.  Once into it, I could not put it down.
0374530718|1.0|Writing about historical philosophy can be extremely monotonous. The never ending details of each philosopher and their accomplishments find a way to all sound the same. Jostien Gaarder tried to take a different approach on this subject matter.  He tried intertwining historical philosophy with an intriguing novel. This resulted in 500 pages of never ending details and subject matter that was presented the same way every chapter. The plot became extremely confusing and difficult to follow and at the same time there were so many philosophers to think about. Jostein's attempt was an unsuccessful scattered 500 page mix of history text book and story.

1400095204|5.0|Brilliant book! Ms. Adichie's historical references to life in the late 1950's and 1960's Nigeria - especially in South-Eastern Nigeria, is so realistic that I could actually imagine myself in that time-line. As a fellow Igbo - born shortly before the Biafran war broke out, most of my information about the Igbos comes from conversations with relatives and associates who witnessed the British colonial rule in Nigeria, the Nigerian Independence and from those who survived the devastating war that killed millions of Igbos. \\"Half of a Yellow Sun,\\" explains and adds to the information I have already recieved about human capacity for love, understanding, misunderstanding, jealousy, hatred, greed and terrible destruction.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|What can I say besides that this is one of the best shows on t.v. right now. I watched only 4 episodes before I decided to purchase the first season. Dexter is a smart, funny, and dark at the same time and you cant help but to love this character. This season is strong and will leave you on the edge of your seats while you get closer to the final episodes. This is a must buy, a must see, and a show that will stay with you for a while.

B000I9U972|5.0|This movie is not like revenge of the nerds at all. It is very unique and only has a nerd as the leading role.  We all knew someone like Napoleon Dynamite in high school, or maybe were that person.  There is no stupid potty humor or dumb funny like in ROTN.  It is witty and dryly hilarious! If you enjoy movies like The Big Lebowski, Old School, or The Weatherman you will love this

0451209338|2.0|Let me start by saying that I did not finish the book.  I made it about 2/3s of the way through before I put it down.  It was not that the book was boring; the story about terrorism and counterterrorism was somewhat compelling.  The problem was with the characterizations, especially of the protagonist, Gabrielle Allon.  I read this book based on a recommendation of the author by an online pundit.  I think I know why he recommended the author; his worldview, at least as it comes across in his blog, is pragmatic.  This is a pragmatic book.  There were no \\"good guys\\" in this book; there were no heroes.  The message of this book is that to beat the \\"bad guys\\" we have to become like them; we have to become \\"bad guys\\" as well.  This is a thoroughly pragmatic worldview, and it left me feeling \\"slimed\\".  Perhaps if I had finished it I would have discovered something uplifting.  But life is too short sometimes, and I have other books to read.

B00005ASGI|3.0|Parallels to the Vietnam  war  are given in \\"A Private Little War\\" as Star Fleet Captain James Kirk must make a fateful decision to interfere with the  natural evolution of a tribal planet  at war, which has already  been compromised thanks to a Klingon agent who has armed one side  with advanced weapons to give them an unfair advantage.   While it may never be popular or even politically correct to criticise government, Star Trek has an impressive history of taking events from our day and put them in  futuristic settings to  make social commentaries that are far more perceptive than what one will find on the six o'clock news. This is is no exception.  The question this episode begs to be answered is how far should a supposedly advanced nation become involved with a so-called lesser culture. Watch \\"A Private Little War\\" and see what happens.    In \\"The Gamesters of Triskelion\\"  the  timeless message of slavery is  addressed as Kirk, Chekov and Uhura are captured and enslaved for the amusement of another so-called advanced race. Things really heat up when Kirk takes the ultimate gamble to save his crew!

Instead, I got ten gorgeous tracks pure of lush and mellow warmth and I wouldn't want it any other way.

0156029065|5.0|Usually when I receive a Christmas present such as this, a fictional tale with several hundred pages I employ it as a dust-catcher on a distant shelf.  Thus are my rooms filled with barely read gifts, and yet something attracted me to this curious volume. Not being wholly familiar with the author I found myself reading the (albeit fictional) account of a medieval man of the 12th century in Constantinople during the crusades.    Now, this trickster of a fellow was born into rural peasantry and through an imagined vision became the adopted son of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. By this stroke of good fortune he is able to cultivate his natural talents toward writing and is sent to the cosmopolitan city of Paris to study. Here begins his journey and the story of his life; which he narrates to a Greek official (called Niketas) during the Latin sack of Constantinople.    It took me the best part of five days to read the entire book, and to be honest it was extremely hard work. Not only does it lean toward a poetic narrative but it is interwoven with many literary allusions, medieval theology, history, philosophy and symbolism. The fact that I had studied medieval society at college helped but it appears that the author has a far greater command of the literary milieu of that time, and incorporated so much of it into this volume that I felt a little overwhelmed.    The principal theme of the tale is the meaning and basis of authority, the question of historical fact; if all recorded history is solely the written thoughts of individuals does this equal that it is completely reliable. How much personal opinion, what dreams and visions, preferences and choices enter into that record of events. Ultimately Baudolino is the man who investigates this principle through his life and relates to us his discoveries; just how much of a good liar must a poet become to be recognized as talented and creative... Baudolino enacts and experiments with all the possible variations of 'communication' and dances daily with reality and fiction. The story invites us to contemplate the existence of an 'eternal truth' by which all phenomena can be measured and related.    In terms of style I found it an almost beautiful combination of elements; a mixture of Dante's divine journey, Froissart's chronicles, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Monty Python and the Search for the Holy-Grail! The Grail is another key element of the tale; a sacred object whose whereabouts is unknown but for which everybody is constantly searching, prepared to kill and die for... the notion of a self created fantasy, a dream which we desire as reality, the search for an ideal is brought forth for serious contemplation. In the final analysis, how much of our temporal lives is a result of our own creation? Umberto Eco has cleverly drawn us out to consider the quality and color of the fabric of our existence; what is sacred and spiritual compared with the ordinary and carnal, can we truly exist without fantasy and fiction, and can we really exist as definable entities without our constructed illusional systems of belief?

If you still want to read it, go ahead.  Expanding your experiences and reading other philosphies on life through reading is never a bad thing.

B00000DR5I|5.0|Definitetly one of TG's best (along with Phaedra and Ricochet) from their IMO golden age (the mid seventies). This album consolidates the german band's somewhat dark approach towards \\"space rock\\" with it's ondulating moog sequences (probably a Moog modular V) and mellotron-driven melodies creating the style known today as \\"The Berlin School\\". Makes a nice contrast to the more melodic Vangelis and JM Jarre (masters in their own right too). A must have in your collection.

This song is upbeat and pleasant.  \\"Weird Fishes and Arpeggi\\" and \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\" are excellent bass driven tracks.  Colin Greenwood shines on these tracks.  \\"Videotape\\" is a spiritual song about the afterlife.  The piano playing by Jonny Greenwood is lovely.  \\"Body Snatchers\\" is an edgy rock track and another highlight on this disc.  Phil Selway provides a pulsating drum beat on this track  \\"House Of Cards\\" is a romantic love song.  I really enjoyed this disc.
B000YENUI6|5.0|With Spider, then A History of Violence, and now Eastern Promises Cronenberg has explored duality or dual personality traits in the main character of each film. While Eastern Promises is the most subtle and least Cronenbergian of all 3, the exploration is still there and Vigo's character eventually, SPOILERS!, reveals that he is actually under cover. This character within a character is what he has been playing with for the last 3 films. While it is true that he has always done this with his films, the last 3 in particular do not rely on any sci-fi machinery, drugs, abnormal video signals, or the paranormal to induce such inner dualities. They are rather, just straight psychological explorations of their characters inner dualities and motivations. Naomi Watts, while the main protagonist and the driving force behind the films unraveling plot, takes a back seat to Vigo's amazing performance and intense scenes. Still her character has a touch of duality too, flirting with danger and sensing, perhaps, something good lurking in Vigo. She never finds out, as we do, that he is in fact working under cover. Despite her ignorance, she is still drawn to him and he to her. Ultimately she cares for the baby and goes back to her normal life. Vigo however, goes back to his undercover post as mob henchman, having risen in rank, overthrown his adversaries, and satisfied his real bosses as well. At the end he does seem to have the feeling of regret that he is stuck in a life he wishes he were not a part of. It is essentially the opposite of History of Violence. He is a good man, willingly acting as a violent man in this film. In History of violence he was a violent man who renounced that and became good only to have that violence revisit him. These themes are the crux of what Cronenberg is exploring. The details are there to hang these concepts on. Overall this is a great film but as Cronenberg films go it is a departure from his more visceral enigmatic works like Videodrome (my favorite), and Existenz, and Dead Ringers.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, all Cronenberg films deal with duality in his main character and how they themselves deal with the issues at hand. This new more subtle approach is a change for a more normal route but it is still good. The fly, was perhaps the most intense approach where the main character is completely transformed. In Scanners the main character jumps bodies. In Videodrome he looses his mind, and in Dead Ringers there are two twin characters with a psychic connection. In the Dead Zone the main character is transformed by an accident. And in  Existenz reality can not be trusted since the character or characters are in an artificial reality.<br /><br />Cronenberg is one of the few directors who consistently produces thought provoking films today. If you do not know his older films I suggest starting with Videodrome and working your way forward in time.rite), and Existenz, and Dead Ringers.

B000002MH5|4.0|This is a very good album, by a very talented artist in J.Mascis. It is now 15 years old, but still stands up, particularly for those people who enjoy unbelievable guitar solos. You won't be disappointed. I brought this album purely for Track 6 (Get Me), and once you listen to it, you will see why. The manic guitar riffs throughout and to close it, it must be one of the all-time great efforts recorded. I just wish I saw him live back in the 90's. Hopefully he'll tour somewhere in Victoria again one day!

0786715103|4.0|This book was heavy ready and to be honest I didn't read every word!

B000XA5K48|5.0|Three words: Over the top.    Over the 39 years of my life, I've watched thousands of movies, read thousands of books, watched more TV than I care to state, and I can safely say that this movie had scenes that I've never seen in any media form before.     Ever.    Did I enjoy it?    Immensely! Never doubt that for a second.     Note that my review contains spoilers, so don't read further if you want to see the movie, or don't care about spoilers.    Have you ever seen a couple in the middle of hot monkey love get into a gunfight and CONTINUE to engage in carnal relations? I haven't.    Have you ever seen a gunfight take place during skydiving? I sure haven't. If I have, I don't remember it.     Have you ever wanted to teach some jack-off on the streets a lesson about signalling, or speeding? This movie is for you.    Ever wanted to deal with someone dealing out corporal punishment in public? This movie will give you satisfaction.     Plot wise, it was pretty complex. What appears to be a homeless man gets involved in trying to rescue a pregnant woman from someone who is clearly out to kill her. It just gets weirder from there.     He kills men by the dozens, all the while helping her deliver. Make that yet another scene I've never had the privilege in witnessing.     Sadly, the woman doesn't survive the ordeal, but the infant does, and more and more people continue to come after the baby in order to kill it.     Later in the movie, it's revealed why the baby has to die, and despite this, Mr. Smith does everything in his power to prevent the death. All the while the body count continues to grow, and the stunts, not to mention the gunfights, get more and more outrageous.     If only the Li, Statham movie War had been this enjoyable.     Many years ago, I read tons of adventure novels while going to school and for years afterwards. Mack Bolan, Able Team, Stony Man, Deathlands, Survivalist, just to name a few.     The action in this movie was like taking scenes from these over-the-top adrenaline filled, lactose laced pieces of pulp fiction and putting them on the silver screen.    Don't take this movie seriously, and you will enjoy yourself. Oh, and I'll never look at a carrot in the same light again. Who'd figured you'd be able to use it for that purpose?    As for the DVD, it has your usual offering of special features. There are nine deleted / extended scenes, with only one being a true deleted scene. The best of the bunch was the extended torture scene that really expands upon Clive Owen's character, Mr. Smith.     One very unique special feature is the animatics - one that the writer / director produced in order to sell the movie. The only way to watch these animatics without being confused is to have the director comments on.     Finally, there are five making of featurettes included.    Pure fun, 5 out of 5.

B000UPSKO8|5.0|This is the COMPLETE version of the Baden-Baden Concert on July 2007, available on DVD from DG, whereas the CD is the excerpted version.<br />By ALL means get this DVD version, since it contains double the contents of the CD, with some BEST performances NOT available on the CD version. (Plus stunning visual effects, of course).<br />Having reviewed the CD version earlier on, I must say that the complete concert reveals some thing quite different and interesting.<br />DG, in its inlaid leaflet, claims that its two artists Elina Garanca and in particular Anna Netrebko alone would have made the concert a success.<br />True - but only to a certain extent, and the truth lies mainly in the VISUAL aspect.<br />Without doubt, both Netrebko and Garanca are top-notch singers. Netrebko owns a voice whose unfathomable lyricism is hard to beat these days from any lyrical soprano. Garanca is a top-notch coloratura mezzo-soprano in the league of the late Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Both ladies attired in Escada's gowns and Chopard jewelry, really presented a wonderful blend of commercialism and artistry.<br />Having said that, IMHV, the best performances that evening, rather from the two ladies, came from much less well-known (allow me to say so since I do not reside in Europe) French baritone Ludovic Tezier.<br />Right after the Norma duet from Netrebko and Garanca after the opening sinfonia, Tezier gave the concert its 'morning call' by his Il Puritani solo aria, a wonderful display of lyrical baritone, rich in tone and flying in coloratura singing. Garanca's Rossini aria from La Cenerantola is the second showpiece, fully demonstrating an agile coloratura. Her Italian diction suffering slightly from comparison with Tezier's, who, by all standards, is a great Verdian baritone in the making judging from his impeccable Italian and wonderful Verdian interpretation in the two Don Carlo excerpts that evening. All these wonderful pieces, apart from Tezier's Don Carlo solo, are NOT available on the CD version.<br />The two MET stars Ramon Vargas and Anna Netrebko were the natural spotlights in this evening, but Vargas, with a significant reduction in body weight, suffered also a reduction in vocal prowess. His shimmering upper register, so famously beautiful, lost some of its usual lustre this evening. On the whole, his performance could be termed 'passable', but short of brilliant.<br />Anna Netrebko's voice being as stunning as ever, the focus got onto her diction as she sang in Italian, German and French on this particular evening. My alien ears however failed to catch the differences, and had to reort to the subtitles' search to find out in what language she was singing, as all sounded so much alike.<br />The Lehar encore piece by Anna included a stunning dancing stint from the soprano, and would otherwise have been perfect but for the slight hiccup in the returning section, luckily speedily picked up by conductor Armiliato. This piece certainly was NOT included in the CD version.wo MET stars Ramon Vargas and Anna Netrebko were the natural spotlights in this evening, but Vargas, with a significant reduction in body weight, suffered also a reduction in vocal prowess.

6305078181|3.0|I've owned this DVD since around 1999, and it is by far the worst transfer in my collection (the old DVD release of \\"[[ASIN:0790729628 Blade Runner (The Director's Cut]]\\" comes up a distant second).  Jaggies everywhere, the coloration is bizarre and, it looks bad even on a standard 25 inch TV set. IMO this DVD is well overdue for a re-release giving it the attention it deserves.  This one looks like somebody sorta randomly twiddled the dials on a digitizer and drop-kicked the film into the machine.    Fun movie though -- this is my favorite version of \\"dracula.\\"  I like the Gary Oldman version as well, but not as much as this one.  Frank Langella really has fun with his role, hamming it up... if you can get past all the jaggies, digital nasties and utter lack of features (the main menu is the chapter selection screen), you'll probably enjoy it a lot.

It is hard to believe a lot of these tales and stories, and his obsession over the Dutches.  I can not see anyone surviving all these drugs and accidents.  Moreover, I never found the book funny.      In addition, there are too many unanswered questions and gaps as previous reviewers pointed out.  I would like to have learned how he started the firm, what the SEC had on him, and what happened to all his money?  What happened in the five years before he went to jail that he mentioned was interesting?  What is he doing today if anything?  Maybe I shouldn't care.      Finally, it did not surprise me about the sleaze and corruption that exists at some of these firms of this size and stature.

B000K15VSA|5.0|The Five Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition release of BladeRunner is a wonderful treat for the eyes, ears and mind of anyone who loves this highly influential film.  I've been a fan of Ridley Scott's masterwork since I first saw it in the fall of 1982 and subsequently I suspect I've viewed it well over 200 times in various forms.<br /><br />I've marveled at the far-reaching influence of the graphical elements, costume, set design and tone have all been paid homage and incorporated into every day life as well as other art forms.  To finally understand Harrison Ford's reluctance to discuss the project was well worth the kit alone!  The extra goodies, the spinner and unicorn are fun, nicely designed additions to the set, as are the beautifully presented concept art panels.<br /><br />Anyone who loves this film will be delighted to receive this set, however please understand that they'll be missing in action for a few hours or days at the very least as they pour over the contents, but rest assured they'll be gleefully, giddily, happy doing so!

B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin's third album was a bit of a departure from the previous two albums, blues and rock-riff oriented, respectively. On their third go `round the band expands this to include a more folk-oriented, acoustic-based attack. You really get the sense that Zeppelin simply wasn't interested in going to the same old well each time or risk becoming stagnant, although the band hardly discards their signature sound altogether. It's a high risk, high reward proposition. On one hand, it keeps the chemistry interesting and the material fresh, but on the other hand the potential to sidetrack and befuddle the fickle fan-base exists. So how does LZ III hold up despite its creative detours? Let's see!    1. Immigrant Song: Simply put, one of the all-time classic Zep songs and a fantastic album opener. A riff that fits right in with those on II, the tune is unrelenting...featuring Plant's signature shriek-laden wail and a thundering rhythm bed. The ascending bass line during the \\"...with thrashing oar...\\" lyric line is merciless. The song is an exercise in giving fans too little of something good, because it's over almost before it's begun. (Ironically Zeppelin sometimes is a bit long-in-the-tooth, arrangement wise...so this is an unexpected twist). Nothing but compliments here. No solo is needed. You're pummeled by the riff alone. (A +)    2. Friends: I'd almost forgotten about this tune to be quite honest with you, as it's one of about 10 Zeppelin songs not usually played on the radio every single day. Imagine my surprise returning to this song that I can only describe as deliciously-haunting behind the lush, Eastern-flavored strings. (It's one of the highlights on the orchestrated Page-Plant Unledded performance, as it's done up quite enthnically and properly). This tune is quite high on atmosphere and ambiance. After a more familiar opening in Immigrant Song, this is your first hint that the album has some surprises in store for the listener. The droning descended note atthe end is an excellent touch. Quite overlooked. (A-)     3. Celebration Day: Didn't have much memory of this song either and initially it struck me as a bit unmemorable, but a few listens had me bobbin' along and singin' Pagey's slide licks, sounding like an interesting amalgam of the first two albums. Pretty simple little rockin' number that subsists on pure adrenaline, workmanship, and solid structure. Good tune. (B)    4. Since I've Been Lovin' You: This tune is straight from the first album, flavor-wise. Wonderful blues number...popping with little Page runs and set over a bed of some lush organ chords. Plant's smokey-throated vocal melody is seductive and subdued in the first verse and perfectly emotive from the second verse onward. A great building dynamic is happening here in the song structure and you can feel the build. Page rips off a guttural solo that draws on all his influences and inspirations from the genre. A pitch-perfect blues companion piece to Babe I'm Gonna Leave You from LZ I. (A+)    5. Out On The Tiles: My relative unfamiliarity continued through to this song, which I have to say I'm still struggling to fully enjoy and have increasingly realized why this isn't amongst the oft-played in the Zep catalogue. It really reminds me (both melodically and tonally) of Rush's Take A Friend, which is to actually say that Rush really reminds me of Zeppelin here...the horse coming before the cart and all. But I'm afraid it's not an overwhelming compliment in any order. It's not a particularly offensive song, but it lacks a real dynamic. It has a generic feel to it, especially given some of the creativity rampant on II and III to this point. Banality is its biggest roadblock. Average songs earns an average score. (C)    6. Gallows Pole: I've always loved this song. Great up-tempo romp that starts with a mournful intro and subdued vocal. The dulcimer (and what sounds like a banjo later in the song) is a wonderful touch, another example of Zeppelin diversifying their layers and textures. The tune slowly and deliberately adds layers of acoustics. Bonham's intro signals that the song is just getting started. The background vocals and bluegrass fiddles in the final 90 seconds are quite un-Zep-like and I can see where some fans mightn't have dug this turn initially. But it's quite the success. I enjoy this a lot. (A-)    7. Tangerine: Gorgeous little ballad with a simple-but-effective acoustic intro and some fine vocal melodies throughout....accented by some tasty wah-wah chords from Jimmy in the back of the chorus. The fuzzy and distorted solo is a nice textural contrast to the lush sound. Another little victory here. A fine song. (A-)    8. That's The Way: I rediscovered this song somewhat accidentally on the Zeppelin DVD, Earl's Court performance. It was quite captivating done at the front of the stage, unplugged and stool-bound. Here in the studio almost nothing is lost. Quite honestly it's a top 3 Zeppelin tune for me and on most days of the week, it might just be my favorite song in their entire catalogue. It's an almost perfect marriage of textures here, specifically the haunting steel guitar fills simply crying and wailing underneath those crystalline acoustic strums. Plant's vocals are wonderful and in an ideal register for this song, even when it picks up in the chorus. The slight flanger effect on his vocal track gives a slight ethereal quality to his voice which works well with the music. Lyrically it speaks to me as well. What a marvelously simple and understated tune. Sometimes the best songs are this way. (A+)    9. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp: Another highlight of the Earl's Court performance, this folksy song (about Plant's dog) is a literal foot-stomping pleaser. Not for every Zep head, surely, this country-flavored, porch-aspiring diddy works for me. It's a fitting addition to the flavors afoot on III, featuring some incredible picking and strumming from Page, simple-but-impossible-to-ignore kick drum beats, spoon-clacking and corresponding claps. Again, while it's not in the same category as Heartbreaker's hard rocking edge, it's another facet to Zeppelin. Rocker purists may or may not appreciate it, but fans of music and musicianship might. (B +)    10. Hat's Off To (Roy) Harper: I've read the full gamut of thoughts on this one, from brilliant to the band simply putting ANYTHING down on record and counting on fans to embrace it, no matter how apparently uninspired and lazy. While I'll concede that Harper isn't necessarily a song I'm going to list as a personal favorite, what I think it lasts in recurring listenability it makes up for in tone and, more so, intent. Perhaps more earnestly than ever, Zeppelin taps into a culture and sound that was very prevalent in the deep south of the United States and sticks it on as a footnote to this diverse record. Plant's distorted vocals, to me, are almost unnerving and disturbing in their warble and accent. I really feel him channeling the vibe and atmosphere of the men who used to play this music. The bottle-neck guitar is muddy and buried in the mix. The end result is a song that sounds like some ghostly remembrance. As a song out of context it's what you make of it. But as a part of the diversity of Led Zeppelin III, and in the context of the first three albums to this point in their career, it's less ignorable. I get it. (B-)    I can see where Zeppelin III might've been a bit underwhelming given the hardcore blues element of the debut album and the hard rock, riff-dominated guitars of the second release. III, while it has its rockin' moments to be sure, is content to be something...else. That understanding requires a bit of patience if you came to the album with expectations. With understanding, the album is quite satisfying and lush and full. It lacks the abrasive quality of each of the first two to be sure, but doesn't sacrifice sincerity, ability or effort in the process of sounding like its own thing. In the canon of the entire catalogue, it's as different as it could be from everything else, and a welcome thing for that reason.    Led Zeppelin III richly deserves an A-
0143038419|2.0|I wanted to like this book, really I did. A story of leaving behind a life that is not truly in line with who you are? All for it. Finding ones self through travel across the world? I'm there! Such a good read that people across the country will be inspired to cultivate their own authentic and meaningful life? Where do I sign up!? But this book isn't that, I can tell you and doesn't justify all the hype. Despite it being referred to as the go to guide for life transformation and waxed about poetic on Oprah, I found nothing amazing about it. There were a few funny parts, and I do mean a few, but this is largely an irritating, somehow disjointed story about someone who doesn't seem to appreciate what she has at any given point. There is something very forced and inauthentic about the whole thing. In a nutshell? I think the author is a bit full of crap. On the other hand, if you're looking for something to say, pass the time on a long flight, this could be a useful read. But if you're looking for anything deeper than mild entertainment, you're looking at the wrong book.
B0002WZTPC|4.0|The movie has always been great. The additional DVD about the making the movie was really well done.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This is a movie that must be watched more than once to be able to understand all that is going on.  Pay close attention to names.  Watch it and then let lots of time go by and then watch it again.  I found a few other reviews helpful as well.

1400079179|4.0|This was again, another situation where the book was a lot better than the movie.  So much important detail is left out of the movie, it probably would have been betterto go 3 or 4 hours like titanic. Book was a very good thriller.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|I've now watched the final cut. It cleans up the audio in several places, and the color is better overall; though there is something to be said for the orange-brown dystopic color of the older versions. This would be the definitive cut if it wasn't for one grating change, and that's where Roy says \\"I want more life ... Father.\\" In the older versions he says \\"I want more life ... F--ker.\\" Now the impact of the scene has been reduced considerably. Roy saying \\"F--ker\\" had a lot of impact and intensity because it's the only swear word in the movie, and it's uttered by a replicant.    Is Ridley Scott pulling a George Lucas here? He gets an A+ for all the other changes, but an F- for this one, for no F--ker. You can't make a change like this after 25 years has gone by.    As far as the rest: good.  I didn't get the 5-disc version because I saw no point in having a workprint version (which I hear is very similar to the Director's Cut anyway).  I'm a fan of the movie, not a fanatic that requires all the droppings off the cutting room floor. A part of me regrets this decision though.      Whoever put together the deleted and alternate scenes on the 4th disc did an excellent job of transitioning them.  It runs like a mini-Blade Runner movie.  One thing that annoys me about DVD releases is that they don't have an option to play all deleted scenes into the movie, or at least have the ability to play all scenes consecutively.    There's a lot of material on the 4th disc and most of it is worth watching.  The documentary is good, though it kind of put me to sleep in parts.
0374280967|5.0|This is the kind of novella you wish was a full-length novel.Like all good writers, Alan Bennett takes you into his world, this time with HM the Queen as your companion. Apart from the advocacy for the importance of reading, Bennett draws a convincing picture of the dreariness of that poor woman's life. When we start to expect so much of our leaders perhaps we need to ask ourselves why we want others to sacrifice their lives for us when we are perfectly capable of standing on our own two feet. This deceptively mild little book left me with many questions about public and private life, duty, literature, subservience etc and I am still reflecting on the ideas he rasies.<br />A wonderful read and you, the reader, can treat it as deeply or superficially as you want.
B000066NW0|4.0|I bought this a Christmas Gift for my 14 year old step-daughter and she was thrilled, it was exactly what she wanted.
B000K15VSA|4.0|From the very beginning of the FINAL CUT you can see and hear the incredible achievement that was BLADE RUNNER.  This is the last great ANALOG FX film and just look at the incredible detail of the miniatures work that was done vs. digital visual effects that are so common today.  The sound quality alone is worth the purchase, it will make your subwoofer work like no other film.  BTW, there is a great story, dark and detailed that stands up for multiple viewings.  Revel in a dark, steamy, crowded and multicultural version of the future with high tech and the medieval marketplace superimposed.  It looks just like parts of New York, LA or Hong Kong today.  It makes you wonder how Ridley got so close and another reason to look back to 1982 to see a vision from the future.  The documentaries show how there is still no agreement about the best version of the film and it's meaning.  I hope by now everyone has made some coin on this one who took the great risks to get this thing done.
B000004286|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack with all the emotionally-charged music from Braveheart, including the war drums and of course the pipes.  I have owned it for over a year and still listen to it all the time.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Mr. Smith is sitting on a park bench, eating a carrot and drinking a coffee.  A pregnant woman runs by him.  A mean dude in a leather coat soon follows.  There's a shootout in an abandoned train station; the woman gives birth; a wicked, intelligent killer named Mr. Hertz shows up.  Smith escapes with the child, and decides to take it to a lactating prostitute.  The three of them go on the run from Hertz, discovering along the way a scandal of tremendous proportions that could forever change the rest of their lives--if it doesn't kill them first.<br /><br />Are you laughing at the implausibility of it all yet?  You should be.  \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is what action fans such as myself have been dreaming of for years--a guilty pleasure without any guilt.  It doesn't take itself seriously, and you shouldn't, either.  As stated in the behind the scenes featurette: there are probably more bullets than words, and that's just how we like it.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, as Smith and Hertz respectively, bounce off each other like pingpong balls; both men are a delight to watch, Giamatti especially taking an immense thrill in the role of a sadistic genius.  Monica Bellucci adds some feminine wise-cracking allure to the film (which all action movies must have).  The movie--both the dialogue and action--is witty and intense; you'll laugh yourself off the edge of your seat, and yet shiver in suspense at the same time.  Never have I seen something so funny be so cool.  The action is as quick, the timing is impeccable, and \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is going down as one of the greatest action movies you've seen.  Not quite a farce--it's intentionally funny, but not to the point of parody--it's more a warm-hearted, warts-and-all homage to the great action flicks of our time.  Making it more than the sum of its parts, in many ways.  So watch it with popcorn in hand, and be prepared to be blown away.

0143038419|2.0|I had high hopes for this book and the first section in India was rather charming.  She eats great food, talks with interesting people and lives a life of ease that most of us can envy at least for a while.  Unfortunately, when she goes to India, the book becomes this self-indulgent drivel.  I just found myself not caring about how still she could become or how long she sat in a meditation cave.  The last section in Bali is OK.  The parts about the Balinese society are quite well done but there's an awful lot that was just dull.  It's obvious that Ms. Gilbert can write, but she needs to do it without so much whining.
0553208845|5.0|In 1984 i lived in Jerusalem. While living there i had the time to read, and to travel throughout that ancient land. Luckily for me i had the opportunity to be given this book which i eagerly read twice. Many of its lessons sank in deep. The ability to focus, the desire to find truth. Its lessons slowly sank into my being. And as i reflect on my life, and those lessons that have survived time, many of Herman Hesses words ring through the years. I would wish that all youth are exposed to these ideas. Surrounded by other youth and adults that have an appreciation for the inner life. In writing my own book - [[ASIN:0973095814 Living Education: The Power of the Circle]] I found some of Hesses words once again-this time an inexorable part of my soul. Read and enjoy.

630522577X|5.0|I saw this decades ago on the New York stage when it starred Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews.  The latter was replaced by Audrey Hepburn, a non-singer because the producers thought Andrews was not well-known enough to the general public.  What nonsense.  She was magnificent in the play and went on to become a great star without this cinematic vehicle.    Not to say that Hepburn is bad.  She is truly beautiful.  She could act, although her cockney feels rather forced.  The dresses she wears are gorgeous, as good as I've ever seen in the movies.  Unfortunately, she doesn't sing well enough to be permitted to sing--in a role that requires a singer.  So Hollywood dubbed in another singer and did it rather poorly, which is a surprise.  Frequently Hepburn's mouthing of the lyrics are not quite in sync with the dubber.  It's hard to imagine why the producers went to such lenghths on wardrobe and set, and then did such a poor job on the dubbing.    Other that that one flaw, this is a beautiful piece of work.  In a movie it is possible to go far beyond the narrows of a small theater stage, to a racetrack, to a very grand ballroom, etc.  Henry Higgins dwelling is almost a character in itself.  And Harrison is perfect in the role, as he was on stage, right down to his demand for his slippers in the final line.  In fact, all the characters are fine.    This is certainly one of the better musicals ever filmed in Hollywood, up there with Chicago, South Pacific, Gigi...  But I can't help but wonder what it would have been with Julie Andrews--or with Hepburn if she had been a singer.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|The Killers have a sound that isn't unique to them.  A far more eloquent reviewer in the mainstream press described them as \\"The best English indie rock band to come out of America\\", or words to that effect.    Their debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" might have gotten the fringe music fans excited but their second album \\"Sam's Town\\" drove them home to mainstream music fans everywhere.  This their 3rd studio release from the Las Vegas natives is a collection of released b-sides, rare recordings, covers and remixes.  Album highlights include \\"Ruby\\" a Kenny Rogers cover, \\"Tranquilze\\" featuring Lou Reed and \\"Leave your bourbon...\\" these tracks single out of the magic craftsmanship and patented forlorn love lost sound that The Killers have mastered and highlight the best side of their borrowed unique sound.  However the Album on a whole is a little uneven. Something that could also be said of \\"Hot Fuss\\". It sounds good, the production values on a whole are very high but it never manages to find its groove.  \\"Sams Town's\\" beautiful story book feel is no where to be seen here and by rights it shouldn't. Perhaps that is the key to enjoying this album,  stick it in the CD player and hit Random. You will enjoy it more.     In closing, I believe if you are a Killers fan you should be racing to buy this album. The linear notes highlight this, it says \\"for the fans\\". This couldn't be more true. As this album only really appeals to the obsessive fans with a driving need to own everything ever recorded by their chosen artist. If you are new to The Killers or just a casual observer, then start with Hot Fuss and work your way forward.
0810993139|5.0|My 11-year-old read this book in 1 evening!  I'll let him tell you what he thinks.    I loved it because its very funny and easy to read (like I said in the title) its very appropriate except for one part which is about the buttox. The book is about a boy named greg's horrible life with his idiotic nerdy so-called friends.
0679882820|5.0|I love this board book!  Although I grew up with Dr. Seuss, I wasn't familiar with this book until I bought it for my children.  I enjoy having it in the board book, since it is shorter and therefore more appropriate for smaller kids (and more durable, too).  My kids are 2 and 4 years old and this is a favorite book for both of them.  Beginning readers can start by reading just the sound words, which are set apart visually on each page.  So my younger child can repeat all the sounds and my older child can read them himself -- what a great book!
0316067598|5.0|I bought this book for my dad who served in the Army for over 30 years with 2 of those years spent fighting in Vietnam.  My dad loved the book, so I decided to read it myself.  I thought it was outstanding!  This book reveals an eyewitness account by Marcus Luttrell himself - not anyone else - and he never claims it to be anything else.  I enjoyed learning about Marcus' life before joining the seals.  I also thought that all the details about being a Navy Seal were very fascinating.  I know that I could never even think about accomplishing the tasks of becoming a Seal for 1 minute.  You have to be a very strong willed and Patriotic individual, to serve our country knowing that you have to leave your own family behind to put your own life on the line 24/7.   I would love to meet Marcus Luttrell and thank him personally for his service to our country!  All our soldiers need more praise and gratitude given to them daily.  I know that he is back in America now, however those memories and injuries have changed his life forever...He served in the Navy Seals so WE (all Americans) can go about our normal lives and be FREE!  This is a MUST read!!!!!
B0001HAHXW|4.0|I bought this when it first came out and was not overwhelmed because I was expecting \\"From the Cradle\\" 2. So, I put it down for a couple of years until I was spending alot of driving time between cities last year. Now, I can't get enough of it. So, listen again. Clapton goes way out on a ledge with this one in the same way he did with \\"From the Cradle\\" coming off of great success. Appreciate it for what it is, a non-compromising tribute to a great influence in his musical career. Don't expect a hard-driving blues record, rather a blend of old and new that keeps the legend alive. Thanks EC. No one else would have even tried this. I just finished his Autobiography which was more painful than I thought it would be. I give him credit for sharing this and I'm buying this for my brother's birthday who is also reading it.

0471463396|2.0|This book is not about value investing, it is about modern security analysis, which is exactly what Graham warned against. It places an emphasis on growth over actual value. One of Graham's fundamental principles was that future growth is completely unreliable and any analysis based on it is just a speculator's way of justifying his gamble. While I liked the book's coverage on franchises and competitive advantage it highlights the fact that fundamentals weren't discussed at all.    Here is the biggest example of why this book is so far off the mark. It highlights Intel as a value investment. The stock currently has a P/E of 25x and has always been over priced from a valuation standpoint. Not only that but Intel's only possible competitive advantage is size. Yes modern value investors look for good companies with long term competitive advantage but not at a high cost. Buffett was famous for sitting out the dotcom boom because they were not value investments.    The only reason this book was not a one star book were the biographies of value investors in the second half of the book.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|If you want to see how one man rids the earth of some of the worlds most evil scum then you have to see this show. OK what he does is illegal and he does work for a police departmaent but at least we can sleep better knowing that what he does makes it a safer place for us. Yes he's a killer himself but at least he doesn't murder innocent people, he only gets the ones who think they have gotten away with torturing, mutilating and killing just for a thrill. The wierd part is that his own father trained him to do this but in a way he won't get caught. It is a cleverly written show but be prepared for some major blood, guts and violence!

0374530718|1.0|In Sophie's World, Gardner attempts to present major philosophical concepts without the dense reading one might find in a textbook.  He is successful in that regard, this book reads like a novel and introduces one to basic ideas that would spark an interest in philosophy, he is concise and accurate in summarizing major philosophers and their thoughts.    Gardner weaves his history of philosophy around a plot that's sole purpose is to keep the reader from closing the book.   His plot does its job but is repetitive to the point of aggravation and ultimately ends up going nowhere.  Also his characterization is so unrealistic that the reader develops a dislike for many of his characters.  Had Gardner been attempting to cerate an appealing piece of fiction he would have failed, however, Sophie's World is meant to be informative.  Many intriguing ideas are covered, which for me were more of an incentive to read than the plot.  For this I would still consider Sophie's World and worth while read, it definitely gets you thinking in a new way.

1416523359|1.0|Liseys Story is not the best of King.  It is the tale of a widow of a famous writer who had a bizarre sense of humor.  It was long, had extended parts of  irrelevant banter, and had an inordinate amount of made up words.  Lisey and her dead husband practically had their own language of stupid words, and King makes the reader learn each and every one of them throughout the course of the book.  The book does start to get interesting about 300 pages in, when a madman pulls out all the stops in order to acquire the dead authors unpublished manuscripts.  However, by the time this occurs in the book I actually hated the main character and was cheering for the villain.  This book would have been a decent novella or short story, all he had to do was cut out 400 pages of the silly talk and get down to the action.<br /><br />Even the biggest fan should ignore Lisey's Story...<br /><br />Relic113
1594489505|3.0|OK, I enjoyed reading it page by page to see what would happen next.  I hated suspecting ahead of time that the next thing would be bad, and being right over and over.  The background war and unrest were as confusing and irrational as I've come to expect of the Middle East.  The brutality, hardship, and destruction were heart-breaking (and therefore well portrayed?).  I had this evaluative problem with McCarthy's _No Country for Old Men_, too.  No matter how you say \\"bloody mess and body parts all over,\\" you paint a strong picture, but strong might not be the same as well-painted.    I despise a society that bags up its women.  The excuse or compensation that the men are showing that they treasure the women won't fly.  That's the kind of treasuring one does with property.  The accompanying dominance / tyranny, neglect, and verbal and physical abuse give the lie to this \\"treasuring.\\"  This is not a problem with the book, except that I can't view the normal injustices sympathetically and the extraordinary calamities much differently.    Mariam is an excellent character.  I only wonder that she stayed sane, having endured a pathetic father, a crazy mother, a hostile hometown, and a domineering husband of convenience (his).  Her relationship with Laila, in all its stages, rings true.  Why wouldn't she be prickly at an intruder second wife, then a friend and ally with her under a common tyrant, and finally a mother to her and her children?      Laila is also well drawn.  I was jarred by the suddenness and completeness of her entrance into the book as the main subject of Part Two.  The later, more conventional, chapter-by-chapter alternation with Mariam worked better for me.  Laila's love relationship with Tariq is beautiful and believable.  Even Laila's urge to return to Kabul makes sense.  The attraction of home, no matter how ugly it may have been, is unaccountably, regularly strong in human beings.      I have trouble with Rasheed, and I think Hosseini did, too.  Rasheed has to serve as a vehicle for portraying good will and normalcy in the culture, but also as the finally unbearable representative of the culture's misogyny.  He introduces the off-stage political action -- the wars, the shifting alliances -- but artistically he can't be made to be very knowledgeable or insightful about them.  This tension hampers the author and the reader.      There's another artistic patch job in delaying Rasheed's anger about Laila's first child.  Hosseini needs a stable household to work with for a number of years, but then also needs a crisis to move the story to a climax.  I don't believe a man of Rasheed's temper and temperament would have held in his anger for a long time if he had learned the truth early in their marriage.  And I don't see anything in the book that speaks of a revelation just before the crisis point.      I really don't want to ask for more gore, but there should have been a lot more blood from a fatal head wound inflicted with a shovel.  The cleanup scene could have been powerful.  The women would have been desperate, grim, desolate, hurried, remorseful, triumphant, relieved, agonized.  The blood would have been life-red, fire-red, maybe even sun-red, sticky, elusive, endless, running out of control.  Maybe Hosseini got tired.  Maybe he wrote it and discarded it.  Maybe his judgment is better than mine.    The hometown Mullah Faizullah and the dying Talib judge are interesting, and sad.  There is humanity in both of them, and faith.  There is also ineffectiveness, and inertia to the point of evil.  The inertial evil is of course much clearer with the judge.  But it's not absent in Mullah Faizullah.  His affection and gentleness go along with constant advice to endure, endure, endure.  That's crazy Nana's mantra, too, and Mariam's burden.  We're reading Melville's _Billy Budd_ again.      A big question in the Hosseini book is what we can do in oppressive circumstances against the alleged weight of God, and when.  The offered answers go all over the map, from endurance to murder to love to war.  Perhaps intelligently, but perhaps inevitably, Hosseini leaves it to us.    1/1/8
0061142026|5.0|Another great tale by Gaiman.  Young Tristran in order to win the heart of his love must leave the safety of his village and find an impossible item - a fallen star.  Read this book before you see the movie, as the book is as the adage goes, better than the movie.  Tristran must contend with witches, a bizarre competition among royalty for the throne, and his own sense of morals in accomplishing his arduous task.  This is not just another fantasy book.  Anyone who has ever done anything for love should read this and remember that there is a reason that stars shine so bright.<br /><br />Relic113

038533348X|4.0|At the opening of the book, the narrator describes a time when he was planning to write a book about what important Americans did on the day Hiroshima was bombed. While researching this topic, the narrator becomes involved with the children of Felix Hoenikker, a fictional Nobel laureate physicist who helped develop the atomic bomb.<br /><br />Vonnegut uses his wit and humor to demonstrate the absurdities of religion and makes many other useful social commentaries on the human race.  The narrator describes his search for a mysterious substance called ice-9 that has mystical properties, and may have incredible benefit(or harm) to civilization, depending on how it used. It is hard to fully describe this book, as one isn't sure what it really is until the last page, but it is a book worth reading for fans of Vonnegut in any event.<br /><br />Relic113
0061122416|3.0|Not a bad book, but in my opinion not worth all they hype it receives.  I had the ending pegged very early in the tale.  While this is a good story involving a boy in search of treasure, the idea that the real treasure awaits at home is a tired motif.  I also am tired of the idea that all you have to do is have positive thoughts and life will work out well for you. I wonder if this applies to people that live happy lives until they are mangled in a car wreck by a drunk driver, or fall down the stairs and become quadrupeds?  While I agree that a positive attitude is important, it cannot save you from bad luck.  Just as alchemists throughout history have failed to turn lead into gold, a positive attitude cannot turn away the specter of bad luck when it rolls snake eyes for you.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story, but hated the moral preaching. If you want a simple tale to read in the period of an hour and half, get a used copy for the train on the ride to work, but please don't swallow all the hype.<br /><br />Relic113
B000BUYP4Q|1.0|Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the second disc. I sent it back not ONCE but TWICE, so in all I tried 3 copies of the movie, and the second disc still would not work on any copy. This movie is great, but DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION, unless you want a DVD that doesn't work. They really need to fix this problem.
B0011Z77Q8|2.0|I wish I had listened closer to the samples before buying this record. I thought the song from Guitar Hero III was cool, so I bought the record. The music is so awesome, it's a tragedy that the singer is so annoying. He really needs to listen to something other than Radiohead, and develop his own voice. After a couple songs, the impersonation becomes pastiche. Maybe the band will find a new singer(with better lyrics) and the next album will really be great.
9562911640|5.0|There is no time like the present, but if only I had been introduced to this wonderful publication years earlier....a must read!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Love it!  Can't stop singing the music...  Another great addition to our Disney DVD collection.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones. The inside of my ears are apparently small than the standard size by which ear buds are made. These ear buds are small enough to fit in my ear without rubbing against the sides of my inner ear and breaking the skin. I cannot find them in the stores anymore, so this is the only way to buy them.
B00000IQMT|4.0|Purchased this soundtrack simply to record a couple of tracks from it.  Not into classical musit, therefore it is what it is.
B00122O34O|5.0|all of the music in Juno is great. all through the movie i was hoping to get the soundtrack as soon as possible, so im very glad amazon has it right here :) great music. love the last one
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Thank you for the prompt shipping. The movie was in excellent condition when I received it and there were no problems with it. Thank you.
B0011Z77Q8|5.0|Muse has become one of my favorite artists. The lead singer has an AMAZING voice, I don't know what strange talker was thinking. I was enchanted by the song \\"Starlight,\\" and \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" I had heard from Guitar Hero III. After getting the CD, I was only more impressed with the band. Their lyrics are great, once again, i'm not quite sure what strange talker was talking about.
B0011ZVU5W|2.0|This is a fantastic album for anyone who likes Metallica.  I just wish they didn't call this album the explicit version when many of the songs are in fact edited.  If it were not for that fact this album would be 5 stars without a doubt.
0684859106|5.0|This cookbook has some wonderfully basic recipes that will be at the top of your list when looking for something really good to bake. My daughter has this and had baked the white birthday cake out of it for my granddaughter's birthday. It was so moist and really excellent. We use it for all birthday celebrations now. One doesn't feel special if any other cake is presented! The recipes are not difficult but the results taste like you have slaved for hours. This is a sure winner and I guarantee it will make you look great in the eyes of those you cook for.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The graphics are very good and the sound effects are even better.  We have watched it as a family and loved every minute.  It is very educational and entertaining at the same time.  I would purchase it again.

0099457164|3.0|I love the plot and I found it interesting, if not believable. However the book gets bogged down in overplayed descriptions of Italian history and mannerisms. The odd thing is that almost none of it ends up being relevant to the end of the story. If you can trod through the boring parts I think it's good enough to read. Also I agree with another reviewer who said the ending was a bit of a let down.
B000NA28I4|3.0|I loved the books, and this view of the literature was very entertaining. Some might get frustrated with what was left out of the movie, but this is only one interpretation of the book. No book to movie film is ever going to get it \\"right,\\" not until you get a semi Fahrenheit 451 stile of world. Were people won't just watch a film for just two hours and can devote time to watching an unabridged movie book.     This however is not just a review of the movie, but a review of the DVD as a whole. When it comes to extras there is only one as far as added delight, commentary of the Director.    All in all good movie and bad extras means a poor DVD. I would spend the extra money for those extras, not a Wal Mart, but here at Amazon for a better deal. Thank you and enjoy.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is an amazing series.  I had seen one or two episods (out of order) and did not love either of them.  When we got the series and watched them in order.  I found both my wife and I staying up late, trying to get in the next disc, because we just loved the characters and story so damn much.

0143038419|1.0|Very self absorbed with nothing of depth or value.  I got to page 105 and couldnt take it anymore! Poorly written, in that she threw in pieces of writing style that were clearly not hers and forced as they did not exist throughout the book such as her description of the meat hanging in the butcher shops in Italy, and the beginning where she starts with \\"I wish Giovanni would kiss me...\\".  an attempt to periodically inject a writing style that is by itself interesting but not her own or consistent throughout the book. It seemed to me that her overreaction to her awful marriage was pathetic and unwarranted and the person who probably really suffered a horrible marriage was her husband and not the writer - pathetically weak and melodramatic. I resent having helped fund this as well.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|Its not classic gilmore. Its not Amy Sherman Palladino's vision for Season Seven. But watching the dvd set, episodes back to back. The season grew on me. Its not that bad. Sure, some plots seemed rushed. BUT!Certain characters who barely spoke to each other in earlier years-start bonding and form mini families of sort.<br /><br />A major shift occurs in the second half. Episode 10 onward, the series experiences a major resurgence. The show becomes more about small town life which is big part of what made Gilmore Girls so unique.<br /><br />If you compare this season to early ones, you will end up disappointed. Amy's touch is gone.<br /><br />Watch it without judgement- save your opinions or analysis until the end of season. Like it or not this is your last chance to see our favorite characters in action. Try to enjoy it.
B000PTYUQG|4.0|Previously a full set of all of Stravinsky's work was well over $200 and since that version is out of print, it sells for far more now.  Where can you get 22 CDs of music for around $30?  I am thrilled with this set, although there is just one small booklet with very little material in it.  A nice plus is that each CD jacket does have the selections listed on the back.  It's a cheapo cardboard box and the CDs are in paper sleeves, but what can one expect for around $30?  If you have always wanted a full set of all Stravinsky's work without paying through the nose for it, this is the set for you.  This set doesn't always contain the best interpretations of Stravinky's work, but most Stravinsky \\"fans\\" will buy copies of their favorites as well as owning this complete set.  Includes some Stravinsky rehearsals too, as well as a clip of Stravinsky talking about the Rite of Spring.  Includes some suites as well as the full work.
0670034711|1.0|I asked for this book for Christmas because a large number of my friends were reading it and raving about it.  I now have far less respect for the opinions of my friends.     Well, I guess if you want to study the journey of a spoiled American twit, you've hit gold here.  To paraphrase:  \\"A successful writing career, a beautiful house in the country, an apartment in Manhattan, and yes, I'm even blessed with the kind of looks that make people flock to me ....  but it's just not ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!?????!!!!!!!\\"    Good grief.    Save yourself the money.  I'm so sorry my daughter spent hers on this and contributed in any way to this woman's \\"self-exploration.\\"  I truly feel like our family was taken to the cleaners by a snake-oil vendor.    ADDED AUGUST, 2008:    There are so many people that don't understand the negative reviews for this book, and why some of us see Gilbert as a self-centered fool.  I would like to try and explain.    Gilbert is lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.  But really she's one of those \\"poor little rich girls.\\"  Because her money and her good looks have been very detrimental to her development.    Many of us find ourselves in untenable situations.  But most of us can't get out of them by shaking our blond curls in people's faces, flashing a charming smile and .. oh, if that doesn't work, why don't we just take a whirlwind journey around the world at the cost of .. well, just several thousand bucks!    What we normal people have to do is find a way to make it work.    We can't just run away.  Sometimes this means we have to settle for a life we hadn't planned.  When we do this, we learn that we aren't the center of the universe.     Elizabeth Gilbert has not been willing to compromise her life enough to do this.  I didn't finish the book.  Maybe she finally grew up.  But she left alot of dead bodies in the dust along the way.    Look, the classic picture of a \\"spoiled rotten brat\\" is a little girl screaming that it's just not good enough, \\"I wanted strawberry!\\", when her parents are trying to hand her a chocolate ice cream cone.  My God, the woman had an apartment in New York, a second place in the Hamptons, a husband who loved her (poor sap), a successful WRITING career (do you know how hard THAT is to pull off?), good looks, money ... and yet it just wasn't good enough!      So what do you do?  Make it work??? Think about the other people in who have also invested THEIR time into your life and relationships?  No!  You run away, take on a younger lover and travel around the world ....      How can anybody miss what horrible behavior this is?  And to top it all off ... she doesn't even get it herself .. instead of being ashamed of herself, she tells the whole world!    She gets a lot of mileage from the depression angle.  Well, I'm sure the spoiled little girl can become very depressed because of her chocolate ice cream cone.  But there are certainly better ways of dealing with it than running away from home.    As an aside ... of course she didn't want children.  One baby in the family was enough for her!  Why would she want competition????    She's a twit.  I am embarrassed that I spent my money on her book (worse yet!  My poor teenage daughter bought it as a Christmas present to me!) and thus helped her buy her Strawberry Ice Cream Cone.
0740748475|5.0|I bought this set for my dad for Christmas, and it was absolutely a hit.  We own all the paperback C&H from when they were first released in the 90s, but they are dogeared and well-loved, so it's wonderful to have the full collection in such lasting and gorgeously presented volumes.  The glossy paper is really great.  Plus, it's neat to have the full narrative presented from beginning to end--brings a new experience to the re-reading that will occur over and over, I\\"m sure.

0374530718|2.0|Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder is a philosophic masterpiece for today's generation.  It is full of western philosophical ideas about the world as well a history of philosophy through the years.     Sophie Amundsen is a normal teenage girl.  However, things change quickly when she returns home from school one day to find two letters containing deep and thoughtful questions about herself and the world around her.  Successive letters show up every couple days, which send the young girl on a crash course in philosophy covering all the greats of the trade.             Sophie's World is an interesting, yet somewhat dry read.  The story line is transparent at times and hard to follow.  As a philosophy student, or someone deeply interested in philosophy, this would be a great book.  However, if you would like a book with a great plot, this novel is not for you.  It most certainly is not a page-turner, and it was hard to read more than a few pages at a time without getting bored.  Also, seeing as it was translated, some of the sentences do not make much sense and do not adhere very well.  I would only recommend this novel to someone studying philosophy or someone deeply interested in it.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|My three year old boy loves this movie. What is not to love about Mary Poppins?  The dancing, the singing, he loves it.  I found the movie very entertaining to watch.  There is also a pop up feature so you can read about interesting facts about the making of the movie, the characters, etc.  That is very interesting. There are some tidbits about Walt Disney's participation.  There are two DVDs and I've yet to see what is on disc 2. I highly recommend.
0786891181|4.0|\\"P.S. I Love You\\" is a story of learning how to live after a loved one passes. Holly Kennedy must learn to go on without her husband, Gerry. Gerry was diagnosed with a brain tumor and radiation treatments were unable to stop it from returning.<br /><br />The book opens with Holly going over the reality of Gerry' death being final and that she was alone. For awhile Holly can't think much past that. The majority of the book is about Holly's healing and the fulfillment of the monthly tasks that Gerry has left behind. Holly is greatly supported by her family and friends. This story doesn't have a traditional HEA, but does see Holly at the end of the book moving towards happiness.<br /><br />This book is far from all tears and I found myself laughing more than I did crying.
0810993139|5.0|I anguished over what to buy my 12-year-old grandson who is totally immersed in video games and anything electronic.  I gambled with the \\"Diary\\" and held my breath.  He immediately began reading it before our Christmas dinner and continued on after dinner.  A week later he told me he is almost finished, and that there was a sequel out already.  I got the hint and told him I would get him the sequel.  His 8-year-old sister is a rabid reader and she can't wait to get her hands on the \\"Diary\\".
1401322336|5.0|My son Chris really likes to cook.  He's very precise when he tries a recipe, so it is always guaranteed to turn out exact.  He is a big fan of Jamie Oliver, having met him when he was here in Seattle a couple years ago. He saw this latest book while at the mall Christmas shopping.  He came home raving about it, which of course gave me the idea to get it for him for Christmas. Chris and Jamie chatted about one of Jamie's recipes that my son made out of a previous cookbook of his.  Jamie was intrigued by my son, who was 17 years old at the time.  I remember Jamie asking him how old he was; he seems to have a soft spot for the younger generation, particularly the ones interested in cooking.  This latest book breaks it down so simply, which my son is excited about.  Good eating doesn't have to be complicated.  The more we learn about basic cooking and eating, as Jamies's latest book breaks down for you, the more we can enjoy quality food without breaking the bank!  I think as a society, we can be lazy about cooking, myself included.  There seems to be no time after work to cook a quality meal.  This book explains step by step how by having a few basic ingredients stocked in your home, you can turn out a quality meal in no time.  Highly suggest this book.
0790731940|4.0|I have two grandsons, 8 and 12.  I wanted a family film we could all watch.  Maverick filled the bill.  In spite of a fairly complicated plot, there is no lull in the action, the comedy relaxes any tension and the surprise ending is priceless.  A good choice for Movie Nite at home.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|An impressive achievement. The movie is truly thought-provoking and the fact that many people from all over the world could see and relate to this movie is great. Cast, cinematography, music, script and directing, they all come together to form a unique experience. See, Hollywood can, *sometimes* make something original and daring.
B000683VI4|5.0|I marvelled at the book and the film version did not disappoint me.  A celebration of love in the purest form.  The road of life takes many turns.  What the future brings, no one will know (until the end of the movie).  Not suitable for young children but ideal film for 19 to 99.
630521610X|5.0|It's a well known fact that Scream was single-handedly responsible for a major revival of the horror genre in the 90's, inspiring countless inferior productions and entering pop culture. Nearly 15 years after its release, and with a third sequel scheduled to start production in the next couple of months, I feel inclined to renew my vows as a ultimate Scream fan, even if I feel a bit scared of this new sequel.<br />Truth is, Scream might just be one of my favorite movies ever. I remember being totally shocked when I first saw it, and I could barely sleep that night. That ghostface mask both haunted and fascinated me. I was barely a teenager, and I was amazed that a movie could get to you like that.<br />It was a scary movie - simple as that - and it had memorable characters who you cared for. The story was interesting, original, and yet, simple. Straight to the point. Soundtrack was great. Acting was fabulous. I think I really started paying attention to technical aspects of filmmaking as I watched Scream and Scream 2 over and over, and listened to the filmmakers talking about it. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that my love for movies in general exploded with the Scream films.<br />And to this day, it holds up well. From the classic opening scene with Barrymore to the (then-)surprising end, we hold our breaths.<br />I'm glad I can still say \\"Scream is great\\" and not be ashamed to have a horror movie positioned amongst many dramas in my TOP-10 favorite movies list!!<br /><br />P.S. I AM Looking forward to Scream 4.... hoping for the best! It will be, at the very least, interesting to get to see where Sidney, Dewey and Gale are in their lives, what they have done!!
0920668372|1.0|I actually returned this book since I myself found it to be a disturbing tale.  The idea of a parent dying is not something that my children need to be indoctrinated to just yet.  I also think that the image of the mother crawling into the adult son's bedroom to rock and sing to him is just inappropriate.  There seems to be some boundary issues at play here.  Cap it off with the morose ending and I'd say you just spend $5.00 to basically feel bad.  There has to be a better way to convey the extent of a mother's love without resorting to morose and guilt laden sentiment.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is one hell of a movie. It simply leaves you dumb-folded after its depressing ending. The performances are outstanding, the script is very well written. You're dragged into the movie's underworld and it's hard to forget it. Everybody should see this movie.
0618680004|5.0|I found it amazing (and fun!) to read such an in-depth book about the \\"delusion of god\\", written by an atheist who is a brilliant evolutionary biologist and well-versed in so many other fields as well.  If you're interested in seeing why atheism is a viable way of living, then this book is a treasure trove of information, insights and thoughts that will captivate you like a good novel can.  Given that religion seems to cause as much (or more!) pain and misery in the world as it helps with, I can only wish that \\"true believers\\" would be honest enough to read this book, maybe then realize just how shaky the ground is upon which they base their fanatical beliefs (which after all, don't allow for empirical proof), and so tone down the \\"culture wars\\" that so divide our country.  It hurts us so much to have every election and every vote turning on such inherently \\"gray\\" issues as God, abortion, gays, and the mistaken belief that only by believing in \\"God\\" can you be moral.  We need to think better than this.

I've been an [...] customer for years, but this is my first written review and it is an emphatic one!

B00005Y6YB|5.0|Spoiler warning....<br /><br />Warning to men: what Steel Magnolias is to women, Lonesome Dove will be to you. I have never in my life been as involved in a character as I was that of Robert Duvall's portrayal of Captain Augustus McCrae, the loud and poetic,  often boorish, sometimes gentle old former Texas Ranger. He made me laugh, he made me think, and, be it when I first say him on the screen as an eight-year-old, or now as a twenty-seven year old, he made me cry when he finally tells his lifelong friend Woodrow, \\"It's been quite a party, hadn't it?\\" and the usually stoic and hard Woodrow, leaning over the dying McCrae whispers with a spring of tears gliding down his cheeks, \\"Yes, sir.\\"<br /><br />Lonesome Dove is about the pursuit of life and the lengths we will go to find contentment as we furiously follow our own dreams and wanderlust, even at the expense of our own security. It is also one of the great tales of friendship told in an extremely original, raw way. Two men, both retired Texas Rangers, have decided to embark on the greatest journey of their lives as they leave a quiet south-Texas town and lead a group of cattle-hands north to be the first Americans to ranch Montana. It is their swan song of sorts, a fitting culmination of a life lived wild and passionate but always with the purity of exuberant effort.<br /><br />It captivated, moved, and excited me almost twenty-years ago when I was a child and still does. I cannot think of a better western or a better tale of friendship between two men.
1596912855|2.0|Austenland could almost work. This very readable offering from a hitherto trusted author explores vital issues that need resolution in more lives than the fictional Jane's. I anticipated real resolution. Instead, we got to watch Jane set herself up for yet another unreal relationship, only this time, with a man who's given evidence of profound capacity for real commitment. It is almost tragedy.     I'll try to explain without giving too much away. Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy gets the blame for Jane's lengthy history of failed relationships, but the little vignettes about them reveal the real problem -- Jane's overeagerness to fall in love and to idealize her beloved rather than come to really know him and relate to him as a living, breathing, fallible but lovable individual. Prime example is the boyfriend of 5 months that Jane \\"experiences\\" without \\"trading psychological profiles\\", only to drop him cold when she hears him snort while laughing. That's not a relationship, but a failed fantasy. And yes, she collects creeps, but how could she avoid doing so when she persistently throws herself into a romance without first solidifying a friendship? She doesn't give herself time to discern whether he's a creep or not, or to discover the mixture of quirks and strengths that form the basis for a real, loving relationship.     Austenland is supposed to be therapy for Jane's penchant for fantasy. And it almost is, with a few twists and turns through layers of self-deception. At last, the moment of truth comes, Jane discovers that she's been deceived yet again and walks away. (Good for her)! And reality -- or the potential of a genuine, committed relationship, follows her onto the plane.     She is astounded. She is disbelieving. She says \\"you don't know me.\\" He says he thinks he does and he wants a chance at forever. He is seatbelted next to her for a transatlantic flight. A perfect opportunity for the best and lengthiest conversation of her life -- a conversation that could laythe foundation for forever. They don't have it. Instead, she pulls him close and kisses him... for the entire flight, only to continue romancing in her apartment once the plane touches down.     Reality has gone on a holiday. We're back in fantasyland, and dreading what's going to happen to this already wounded hero when Jane finally wakes up and discovers that he snorts, or does something else equally irritating.     A different ending could have made this a worthwhile read, although it might not overcome the improbabilities of finding a good man in a high-class-almost-brothel like Austenland.     I expected better of Hale.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|I thought the CD sounded alot like Rising, but not as good. Having played it 7 or 8 times, maybe it will grow on me, but the majority of the songs, for me, leave me wanting. Disappointing.
0316926345|3.0|Waugh's prose is a joy to read but the story itself is dissatisfying. The book begins with an intensely close relationship between the narrator and Sebastian Flyte, and for starters, Sebastian is neither interesting nor likeable. And as much as we are told of the intensity of the friendship and love between these two, it's really something the reader has to accept at face value. It's not \\"powerful,\\" despite several gushing reviews to that effect. Sebastian later becomes an alcoholic, exits the stage for points east, and there never is much of a sense of closure with him. Instead, his sister Julia, a minor character in the early chapters, becomes the love interest, while the most (only?) interesting, intelligent, independent and funny character, Anthony Blanche, flits in and out of the plot at odd intervals. In all, Brideshead Revisited is a stuffy soap opera about a pious upperclass British family, and as such it epitomizes Mark Twain's description of classic literature: a book everyone wants to have read but nobody wants to read.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|That's what I said to the person who suggested this film to me.  Then, I got a history lesson.  Turns out, the original or 'Traditional' skinheads in Great Britain were a multi-racial bunch. Reggae was even one of their primary choices of music.     Shaun (Tomo Turgoose) is going through a tough period in his life. He just lost his Dad in the Falklands War, and he's understandably not doing too well. Unfortunately, a wardrobe malfunction makes him the target of a group of kids needing someone to pick on.     Shaun finds friendship and respect in a skinhead gang. At the time, the gang's led by Jamaican, Woody. Later, the original leader of the gang Combo returns from prison and he's gained a whole new racist agenda there.     Still, Woody is welcome and even a Black member can join, because Combo sees his agenda as anti-Pakistani.      \\"This is England\\" covers a lot of painful and controversial territory:  student bullying, gangs, racism, war.  It's not an easy watch--but a good one.      I think the characterization is some of the best I have seen in British films.  Shaun, Woody, even Combo come alive on the screen.  And yes, Shaun grows up--getting older and wiser, but still looking like a cherubic innocent.     WARNINGS:    Use of strong language  Violence  Juvenile misbehavior including destruction of public property  Tough subjects in general

1881273156|5.0|This book offers so many interesting concepts for you and the people in your life to ponder.  Whether you're in a serious relationship (what this book speaks of) or not, you could surely benefit from the ideas presented in the \\"love languages.\\"  They will absolutely benefit any of your relationships, with friends, family or significant others.    The book is a quick read and great to read aloud to your partner.  Also, the tests in the back for you (and your spouse) to take to determine your love language are fairly quick and fun.  I absolutely recommend this book!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This was a christmas present and we are loving it so far.  It's absolutely breathtaking in HD!  We've really enjoyed watching it with our children and actually learning things in the process.  A definate must for your HD movie collection.
B000UFAURI|5.0|Excellent cd. A must own for any true rock fan. This cd really demonstrates the growth of the Foo Fighters. Stanger Things Have Happened is a great cut, with fantastic guitar playing during the extended solo. This is a direct reflection of Chirs, as he is truly an underrated player. As with all Foo Fighters CD's, the radio songs are great, but the true gems are usually found on the b-sides.
1401300529|5.0|As I read this book I felt I was reliving some of the most important events of my High School years. I remember sitting around the radio with my parents listening to reports of the North Korean invasion of the South. I remember hearing bitter comments as the war went from bad to worse and then to stalemate. I remember feeling that Harry Truman was vastly underrated in his conduct of the war and that he was duty bound to fire Douglas MacArthur. I believed then and I do now that the shameful lack of preparedness of our Army troops when they were sent into that war was unforgivable. And I still believe that the Korean War was the beginning of the end for Soviet agression.   And all of this is revealed in fine detail by David Halberstam in his magnificent book. It deserves  careful study by all who seek to understand the past so that the future will not see the same mistakes.  A great contribution to American history.

I highly recommend not using Unbox service until they turn it around or at least admit to the countless bugs it has.    The actual movie is fun for people that enjoy this genre.
1563890119|5.0|This series....but especially this graphic novel really redefined the concept in the way Alan Moore did. The creativity....the flow of the writing the use of the art.....I read a article in which Alan Moore talked about the graphic novel as an artform....why it was worth while...the ability to tell a story and put a subtle detail in one page that the reader flips back to look at after reading something else.....that is what gaimon really captured in this series.
0375758992|3.0|Fuller writes an honest (the book's greatest strength) but skeletal (the book's greatest weakness) account of her childhood in south/eastern Africa. Fuller's parents were of, perhaps, the last generation of white expatriates who hoped to govern in Africa. Her mother's wish: that one country in Africa remain white-run.    Although Fuller, by race, is of this European superclass, her family is not wealthy. So they struggle and they relocate. Her upbringing emboldens her to think her white self superior to the black native muntu.(She admits to this \\"Anglocentricity\\" in the best written part of the book, the afterword: \\"My Africa\\".)    {{And now a personal recollection. Fuller and I were in Malawi at the same time: she, a member of that expatriate white community trying to forge a life in Africa; me, a member--\\"two-year wonders\\", Fuller calls them--of the aid community trying to help in Africa. The groups did not mix well. When I asked the white manager of a tea estate how long it would take before Malawians would be able manage the farm, he said: \\"These boogers are only one bound out of the jungle\\". Racist, yes; truthful,. . .?  He, though, was willing to stay and work and live in Malawi evermore. I taught my three years at a secondary school, bolted, and kissed ground when I landed back in the U.S. Who deserves criticism? Who helps more?}}    The most moving part of the book: when Fuller visits the hut of a native family and then returns--as a gesture of thanks for their hospitality to her--to offer second-hand clothes to them. That recollection reveals the humanity of the family she visits and the humility and compassion Fuller started to feel as she matured.    That is the type of writing--unfortunately only found in this passage and in her afterword--which would have made this book great.

B000YPUF9W|4.0|Taking place not long after the events of Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Resident Evil: Extinction finds the T-virus spread all throughout the planet, leaving a handful of nomadic survivors in what has become a barren wasteland.  Among them is Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically altered hero and renegade experiment of the Umbrella Corporation, who searches for survivors.  Also among the zombie-ridden wasteland is Claire Redfield (Heroes' Ali Larter), who travels in a survivor-filled caravan with Alice's old mates Carlos (Oded Fehr) and LJ (Mike Epps).  As they attempt to make a trip to Alaska, where the virus has supposedly not reached, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) prepares a final plan to lure Alice back to continue his research.  More than likely the final live-action film based on the video game series, Resident Evil: Extinction is by far the best of the film series, boasting the most action and bloody violence.  Paul W.S. Anderson once again writes, while this time around Russell Mulcahy (the original Highlander) directs with plenty of visual and enough visceral flair.  Also featuring Ashanti, Spencer Locke, Linden \\"Johnny Cage\\" Ashby, and Jason O'Mara as Wesker (!), Resident Evil: Extinction also manages to pay the most homage to Capcom's video game series more than any of the previous films to boot.  That alone should be enough for you to check out Resident Evil: Extinction if you haven't already, as fans of the previous films and the games both should be more than satisfied with what they get here.
B00005ASHM|3.0|Pet Sounds was a groundbreaking album when it was released in may 1966. That doesn´t mean it´s a masterpiece; only a few of the songs are good.  How many people would give Pet Sounds a 5 star review if it had been released in 1968 or 1969? I think one should review the songs, not the release date.
0312330537|2.0|There may not be much new to add to the hundreds of reviews already written, but given that the overwhelming majority include 5-star ratings, i feel compelled to reduce the overall average, as this is nowhere near a 5-star novel.  With its blend of adventure, philosophy and mystery, it reminds me of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but doesn't live up to its early promise.  There's way too much effort on the author's part to \\"blow your mind.\\"       The novel is, of course, based on the exciting outlaw escapades of the author himself who sadly inserts himself way too much into the novel.  His characterization of the city he loves (Bombay) and its people are wonderful, and by far the best part of the novel.  His relentless explication of the many facets of his moral code are by far the worst parts of the novel.  A few scenes of Linbaba standing up for truth, justice and the \\"thieves\\" code of honor - to illustrate the fine line between perception and reality of good, bad, and evil could have passed. The relentless parade of thinly-veiled morality scenes with the fugitive Linbaba explaining each and every one of his actions becomes just plain irritating.     Some judicious editing to knock the fugitive off his moral high horse would have been much appreciated, and could have easily turned Shantaram into a 5-star novel.
B000YABYSS|5.0|Melvin Tolson, a professor of English and speech, was the organizer and coach of the Forensic Society of all-black Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.  He considered debate to be a blood sport in which victory was the only goal.  He was an autocratic individual who wrote the arguments that the debaters were instructed to deliver.  In his spare time, Tolson dressed plainly and risked his life to organize sharecroppers and other farm workers.  The year was 1935, a time when racism was ingrained in white southerners and workers were at the mercy of their employers.  It took enormous courage and commitment for Tolson to undertake such a dangerous task.  However, he was a man of conscience who refused to retreat from a struggle in which he so fervently believed.<br /><br />This is an old-fashioned movie about the importance of pride, self-respect, and dignity.  In lesser hands, such a film could have been boring, trite, and sentimental, but fortunately, Denzel Washington and screenwriter Robert Eisele imbue the film with passion and intelligence.  The charismatic Washington portrays the self-confident and dedicated Tolson with his usual flair.  His students initially worship him, but they eventually dare to challenge his dictatorial ways. One student in particular, the well-read and rebellious Henry Lowe, wonders why Tolson does not allow the debaters to formulate their own arguments.  Denzel Whitaker (no relation to the stars of the film) is James Farmer, Jr., a chubby teenager who is brilliant but a bit immature to be attending college.  He has a hopeless crush on Samantha Booke, played by the lovely and graceful Jurnee Smollett.  Booke, who is attracted to the flirtatious Lowe, hopes to become one of the few black female attorneys in the United States.  Forest Whitaker is magnetic as the stern James Farmer, Sr. a minister who is very demanding of his son but softens when he begins to appreciate James Jr.'s superb intellect and fine character.<br /><br />Lowe, Booke, and Farmer are the core of a champion debating team that makes history by challenging students who attend white colleges.  The final debate, which takes place at Harvard University, is absolutely electrifying.  As the contestants argue back and forth about the pros and cons of civil disobedience, the pair from Wiley College rise to the occasion.  What is most impressive is the fact that their words and ideas come not from their coach but from their own minds and hearts.<br /><br />\\"The Great Debaters\\" is not just about winning verbal contests.  It realistically depicts the discrimination and oppression that minorities and workers suffered daily at the hands of the racists and tyrants who subjugated them.  There was no rule of law at the time.  John Heard has the thankless role of Sheriff Dozier, a redneck sheriff who is determined to see Tolson behind bars or preferably dead for daring to challenge the establishment.  What makes the movie particular memorable are the quiet scenes in which the actors' expressions speak volumes.  James Farmer, Jr. is appalled when his father is forced to demean himself before a pair of smirking low-class whites after he accidentally runs over their pig.  James Jr. wonders how a man whom he respects so much could possibly behave in such a servile manner.  Viewers will be revolted by another scene in which the debaters happen upon a mob after they have strung up a black man and set him on fire.  This was the reality of the Deep South.  Men like Tolson and Farmer were just a few of the pioneers who sacrificed so much so that their children would no longer be forced to bow their heads in shame.<br /><br />Although \\"The Great Debaters\\" breaks little new ground cinematically, it is a poignant film with fine performances, capable direction, good production values, and universal significance.  High school teachers would do well to assign this movie to their students.  It should provoke  a lively class discussion.e core of a champion debating team that makes history by challenging students who attend white colleges.

0307387151|3.0|as some else pointed out, this book has the makings of a great novel.  the plot starts off from a rather unrealistic twist of events ( in my opinion ) and then reflects back on them along the lives of the main three characters ... ... unfortunately the author doesnt conclude it in a satisfactory way. the result leaves you hanging..   i think the author makes it a point not to make this book about the plot.. he even says so through briony's thoughts in the first part... did the author think that the modern story telling need not a story?.. the books seems to be about emotions.. very well captured emotions to be fair..  the writing was amazing, although can get very tedious sometimes... had it been much shorter, and the part about the war much compact i would have given it 4 stars... but the plot remains sluggish and pointless and that definately costs it a star.. i kept wondering about the book long after i finished it so that probably makes it a good book for me.. if you're looking for something to enjoy reading that would carry you along, then look elsewhere..   and the movie is better...
B0007WYFHU|5.0|I'm reading this book for my 12th grade literature course and I have to say, Arundhati Roy is a goddess amongst writers. Her style--whimsically descriptive, lyrical and lush hides a sweet sharp blade. Her characters--human, real, flesh and blood like you and like me. Ammu, Chacko, Baby Kotchamma, Mammachi, Pappachi, Estha, Rahel: all are reflections of our own families. The structure of the plot bewitches and bewilders--like a Tarantino film, flashbacks within flashbacks, mesmerizing and paralyzing all sense of time till there is no sense of time and THAT'S when you find yourself at the end of the book, beaten, bloody and aching for more--knowing that there can never be more.     It takes a patient and willing mind and reader to get this book. You cannot just breeze through it, you cannot enter into it expecting a clean cut story--a prepackaged ready to assemble story. Those sorts are mockeries of the the human drama, the human condition. No, you must bow before the god of Small Things and even if you refuse, this book will have you at your knees begging for mercy in the end.     The God of Small Things leaves a deep pain your heart, makes you reflect on your own relationships with your loved ones, makes you question your life and the way you're living it    --it is heartbreakingly beautiful, like raven-haired sirens on the sea.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|Before you start reading the rant below i'd just like to say that this review is geared towards people who for stupid reasons are giving this cd substandard reviews. If you aren't one of these people and your just reading reviews because your curious about van or want a good place to start and get a good sampler of his hits and essential tracks then, this is a perfect cd and i wholeheartly recommend it.    however if your a person looking to bash this cd keep reading.          after reading all the other reviews of people whining and complaing about that its only one disk and the track selection and alot of this aren't hits well, guess what Shut Up !!!.Van Morrison does not live to please you. You should be happy that he replaced the out of print vol.1 and 2 versions and realesed this comprehensive one disc version spanning his entire career from 1965 - 2005.Its impossible to boil down 40 years on a single disc and please everybody but all these are good songs and deserve five stars.if you want more songs from \\"them\\" or your mad that half of moondance isn't on here then go buy all the cds!(which are all being remastered and rerealesed this year). In conclusion from his albums with the band Them to his 2005 album Magic Time these are all great tracks and is the best possible cd to pick up if you want a van retrospective.    Thank You for your time and attention
0440238609|4.0|This is the rare book where I found myself nodding along with as many parts from the five-star reviews as from the one-star reviews.  I am honestly very torn in my intellectual and emotional reaction toward this series.  For me, the pure imagination, philosophical depth, and sense of adventure in this trilogy outweighed its flaws--making it a very worthwhile read, in the end--but it was these flaws that kept me from giving the five stars it had the potential for.  Yet because it is a story I feel quite passionate about, I have a feeling this is going to turn into a rather long review.  At this point I should say that it is impossible to discuss either the merits or the demerits of this series without giving specific examples, so read no further if you wish to avoid SPOILERS.<br /><br />In \\"The Golden Compass\\", Pullman introduces us to the wonderfully imaginative pseudo-Victorian world of Lyra's, full of daemons, armored bears, and intriguing and morally ambiguous people (including Lyra herself).  The richness of Pullman's description of the Oxford of Lyra's world as well as the arctic north remind one of the wonder the reader first experiences upon discovering Harry Potter's Hogwarts or C.S. Lewis' wintry Narnia.  I do not make these references lightly, for while the later books are more evocative of Milton or Dante, the first book has the familiar feel of the best of the genre-typical \\"ordinary boy/girl discovers extraordinary powers and embarks on an amazing adventure\\" theme, this time casting Lyra as an obstinate oracle with parents who happen to be two of the most powerful people in the world.  Lyra is given the alethiometer, an interesting \\"truth-telling\\" device that is the first of several problematic plot devices.  Even if one suspends their disbelief that Lyra (not exactly a Scholar-in-the-making, at this point at least) is able to intuitively use such a device, the problem with its existence is immediately obvious with the first time of many \\"Gee ... what should we do?\\" \\"Hey, let's ask the alethiometer!\\" patterns (it's ironic that an anti-religionist uses a deus ex machina plot device, but I digress).  Pullman's choice to have Lyra use the omniscient alethiometer at certain points in the plot but not others makes for a convenient (but transparent) plot device.  Imagine how different this story would have been if Lyra had done the obvious thing and asked the alethiometer \\"How come Dad's acting weird?\\" toward the end of the first book.<br /><br />We meet Will in \\"The Subtle Knife\\", and I must say that I was surprised to find that I liked Will a bit more than Lyra (who becomes oddly dependent and submissive as the series progresses--same as her mother).  Whereas Lyra is a tad schizophrenic at times (one second she awes the reader with her insights on human nature and the brilliant ideas she creates, the next she causes the reader to smack his/her forehead as she forgets lessons as simple as \\"don't take rides from strangers\\"!), Will is an intriguing young Byronic hero--brave and passionate, yet full of inner turmoil and doubt.  Being from \\"our\\" world, the reader is more able to identify with his perspective of Lyra, the \\"multiverse\\", and the other odd occurrences going on around him.  Pullman again creates a beautiful new world quite different from the ones we are familiar with, and we see the complex and touching relationship between Lyra and Will begin to blossom.<br /><br />The story begins to unravel with the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" as there was a lot of action but a lot of unclear motive.  Why exactly did Mrs. Coulter kidnap Lyra (and how did she get so quickly to her hiding place when it took her pursuers a rather long, hard journey)?  What was up with Metatron exactly?  Why exactly did Lyra go to the world of the dead?  I must say that that journey was a spine-tingling good adventure evocative of both Dante and ancient Greek mythology, but it seemed less a chance for Lyra to \\"make good on her promise\\" to Roger and more aneeded opportunity for Pullman to show what \\"really\\" happens when you die.  I realize that many of these questions were answered, at least superficially, in the text ... but few had truly convincing answers upon deeper thought.<br /><br />The anti-religious rhetoric reaches its peak (which is too bad because the underlying, humanist re-telling of the Genesis story was quite clever), often blurring the lines between the characters as they confessed their similar stories of how the Church is evil/empty/unfulfilling and avoiding/leaving it was the best thing that could've happened to them.  There are a number of \\"low blows\\" as well, such as the ... over affectionate, shall we say? ... priest Will encounters as he searches for Lyra.  Meanwhile, during Pullman's zeal to bash organized religion, a number of important characters and plotlines were virtually ignored or grossly underdeveloped, the increasing battles between Lord Asriel's forces and the authority are confusing and cartoonish, and after one of the most genuinely touching and beautiful romantic encounters I've read in fiction, Pullman creates a number of rather arbitrary rules about the metaverse to pull Lyra and Will apart.  I mean, come on ... can't we just have one more little open window?  Or an industrial sized rattrap for the Specter that would be created every time the knife was used?  Even Adam and Eve got to stay together in the Bible ... pulling Will and Lyra apart seemed unusually cruel for both them but especially for the reader who's invested all this time in them--and an odd (and unnecessary) departure from the otherwise parallel re-telling of \\"the Fall\\".  Their choice is a curious one, and sadly left unexplored--is a long life apart really better than a short life together?<br /><br />After all this complaining, you might wonder why I still gave this trilogy even four stars.  First, I cannot describe how incredibly imaginative and captivating these stories were.  Despite this trilogy's \\"warts\\", I was completely absorbed in a thirst to discover \\"what happened\\" as well as \\"why\\".  The basic message which I believe to be at the core of this trilogy--paradise is not something lost in the Fall, nor something to anticipate after death, but rather something to create right here on earth--is actually rather uplifting, and the extolling of \\"conscious goodness\\" rather than \\"childlike innocence\\" as the core element of virtue and spirituality is quite fascinating.  Even though the trilogy has numerous internal inconsistencies and Pullman commits the writer's mortal sin of selfishly valuing his message more than the enjoyment and stimulation of the reader, I might have been able to overlook those problems if the ending had been more palatable--the story might have been even all the more perfect for its imperfections.  Yet, in the end I couldn't help but thinking that for a story promoting love, wisdom, and humanism the ending was quite bleak and melancholy AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.  Pullman waited until the end of his story to add and change the laws of the worlds he created (a big fantasy/SF no-no) in a heavy-handed and artificial way to avoid a happy ending that seemed inevitable and deserved for his bloodied and weary young protagonists.  An epic will always be judged by its ending--the reader must believe that its characters lived, loved, and died with a purpose.  With the ending Pullman chose, that \\"purpose\\" becomes ambiguous at best.<br /><br />In conclusion, Pullman's underlying message is unorthodox yet uplifting, and this trilogy was both interesting and intellectually stimulating and it should be read *and discussed* by religious people, agnostics, and atheists alike rather than either blindly banned or praised simply because of its views.  Yet, because of the flaws mentioned above, I cannot shake the thought that he could've conveyed his message even more effectively and in a way that would be even more satisfying to the reader without sacrificing his core beliefs.  Rather than sermonizing, Pullman should have remembered his own advice--just tell stories.discover \\"what happened\\" as well as \\"why\\".

B00005JPLW|4.0|Much can be said regarding historic accuracy and depth of message in this film. Therefore, to fully enjoy the film you need to understand that this film is only loosely based on the resistance of King Leonidas of Sparta against the forces of King Xerxes of Persia at the Straits of Thermopylae. Also, the film is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and therefore the plot lines are very direct and the screenplay by Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad is written in maxims and declarative statements. That being said, the film is entertainment particularly targeted to adolescent males and young men. It is the exact opposite of a 'chick flick'. The film is violent but the violence is choreographed to a high degree, and even displayed in slow motion in many parts of the film. The film is archetypal in the Jungian sense in that Leonidas plays not only a king, but the archetype of a king resisting power over his range of actions. Xerxes is not only the king of Persia but he is the larger archetype of the forces that curtail and suppress individual expression and independent action. Thus the film will have an archetypal appeal to young males who sense the ever creeping social constraints upon individual action and who wish to strike back with heroic action.     The film is a visual treat even if there is much violence and bloodletting. The acting is over-the-top, almost operatic in its use of grand gesture. There is no way to over-act in a film that is attempting to push limits and provide an operatic grand statement.     Gerard Butler is excellent as Leonidas. He is the finest visual example of the archetype of the Greek King from Greek Mythology that I have ever seen on film. He is supported by beautiful Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo. These two lead actors are surrounded by a cast of virile men, revealing much of their beautiful bodies. Dominic West as the traitor politician makes a fine villain. David Wenham as the one-eyed story-teller Dilios does a fine job (you will recognize him as the tragic Prince Faramir in the Lord of the Rings films). Vincent Regan is allowed more dramatic range than most of the other actors as he plays a Captain who grieves the loss of his youngest son on the battlefield. Andrew Tiernan plays the hunchbacked Spartan who turns traitor. He is an excellent actor (see him in the Horatio Hornblower series as a mentally disturbed sailor). Finally, Rodrigo Santoro is over-the-top as the homoerotic giant King Xerxes. He appears almost nude in every scene, conveying a sense of both masculine and feminine power.     Relax and don't try to make this film into some historic or philosophical statement. It is visually striking entertainment. It is testosterone driven so as to appeal in particular to young men. However woven into the matrix of the film is a dream-like archetypal story of struggle and resistance against overpowering force.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Moore does a good job at really making you think about what is wrong with the health care system in this country in an entertaining way!  While he does seem to portray the systems in other countries as a bit more idealistic than they actually are, it serves to emphasize his accurate portrayal of the terribly flawed system we have here in the U.S.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|Basically this about 2 people who have \\"secret\\" jobs only to find out that they don't know of each other's secret life. After a twist they turn on each other but the flame of their past won't allow themselves to pull the trigger. They come together when they need each other the most. They're both fantastic actors, Angelina of course looks fantastic and the action along with pretty funny makes this movie an A+ in my book.
0439882826|5.0|My husband is a bone fide Star Wars goober and he loved this!  As suggested by another buyer, I bought one for him to read and one to keep as a collector's item.  The detail in this pop-up book is truly amazing.
0743486285|5.0|I was out and about with the family and noticed this book sitting on a shelf.  It caught my eye but I didn't stop to pick it up.  On the way back out of the store, it caught my eye again.  That time I picked it up.  I was stunned to see it was written by Nikki Sixx...... I guy I literally dreamt about as a kid.<br /><br />I came home and dove into it.  The beginning of this book tells you it's not an easy read.  I would have to say that's both true and false.  It's a bit hard to read because it's so raw but I could not put it down.<br /><br />I've never read a book like this one.  Nikki lets us all into his severely demented world for one year of his life.  There are excerpts from his journals and interviews with people that were in his life.  These interviews are NOT sugar-coated.  Nikki wanted people to be honest and I think they did a good job at not holding back.<br /><br />This book does NOT make Nikki look like a fantastic guy but it does show you a world that you, more than likely, would not be able to even have nightmares about.  It's hard to imagine that all of what's in that book happened in a year's time.  It's even harder to imagine that Nikki is still alive to be passing on his story.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly suggest reading this book.  Addiction has affected everyone's lives in one way or another.  It's a bittersweet thing to read this book.  On one hand, you have knowledge.  On the other hand, it is sad to realize that this really was Nikki's life.  It gives you a greater understanding about what addicts REALLY go through.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I won't go into the clever game of tagging all of Tarantino's references to cult films and music of the past. Suffice it to say, I know where he's been. I saw Vanishing Point four times while it played at my local cinema for a week and couldn't believe it didn't get an R rating for that naked chick (I was 15 back then). When my kids were little I taught them Dave, Dee Dozey, Beaky, Mick, and Titch as a nursery rhyme of sorts. I could go on.  In short, this should be my kind of movie. But along with the good, there is bad and ugly in this movie.  First, the good. Kurt Russell is excellent as Stuntman Mike. His take on crazy makes me think of where Warren Oates could have taken his character to from Two Lane, Black Top if there had been a sequel. It's a gem of a performance and he's the 440 under the hood that drives this movie. And speaking of driving, that's the real pay-off at the end. It's a magnificent hunter vs. hunted, male vs. female, Russ Meyer vs. Richard Sarafian car chase.  Now the bad. So the movie bombed in the theaters. At the time, I blamed that on his market audience just wanting to wait on extended, unrated DVD cuts (like me, except I can use the excuse of there's no theaters in my town). However, there could be another reason. In Pulp Fiction, those profanity-laced endless conversations were quirky and philosophical. What we get in Deathproof is endless, profanity-laced, bitchy, girl talk about who screwed who (please make it STOPPPPPPPP!!!) It gets to the point that the chicks just seem to argue about EVERY FREAKING THING and if only Stuntman Mike would just run them over, I'd buy his blessed pea-pickin' heart a twelve-pack of Rocky Mountain Coors (and not that lite crap). Maybe this is what drove Stuntman Mike crazy to begin with.  And now the Ugly. I've shown my kids Le Mans and they are big fans of Bullit. I noted to them that this stuff is the real thing, not CGI like in that incredibly crappy remake of Gone in Sixty Seconds. I grew up in the musclecar era. I had a screaming fast Barracuda. My point is, how could anyone who loves those car DESTROY ABOUT TWO DOZEN OF THEM???? OhMYGTOD, the INHUMANITY!! These babies are not exactly coming off the assembly line anymore. When the stunt crew proudly related how when one Challenger or Charger was damaged, they did the exact same matching damage to the other cars, I realized why some people call for Jihad in this world! This holocaust of Mopar dreamcars is hideous beyond measure (the Nova destruction was ok, because I hate those damn Chevys)! This, my Moparlover brethren, is what takes the joy out of this film. And this calls for action, before it's too late. For decades we have seen the disclaimer, \\"no animals were killed or injured...la dee freakin' da\\" and of course, it is politically incorrect to smoke (unless it's dope) in current movies. Now Hollywood must come to the realization that it is INHUMANE to damage and destroy Detroit muscle in the making of a film. Movies need to be monitored to see that the use of such wheels as these does not leave a scratch or mar their finish in the least. And as for you, Mr. Tarantino, I hope you don't lose too much sleep at night over every child who will never grow up to own a 1970 Dodge Challenger because you HAD to destroy them in your movie. In the balance, is the world a better place adding Deathproof to our respective Netflix queues or are we worse off for your subtracting the existence of untold number of Challengers and Chargers from our midst? I think you know the answer to that Mr. Tarantino. I think you know.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|this was a beautiful book. it took all the knowledge from Max's Zombie survival guide and applied to to the personality of the world during and after the war. very insightful in the politics and choices mankind would make in the (sad to say it) unlikely event of a zombie infection. he nailed the psychological and physical effects of a Zombie War. Even people who dont like zombies should read this just for how smart it is.
B000JLTRKE|2.0|After all the hype, I was disappointed with this movie.  I fully appreciate the horrow these two families endured while waiting for news of thier loved ones but I was a little shocked that only two family stories were covered. It seems much of the movie was spent watching the two trapped officers.  I didn't expect history to be re-written but a more comprehensive look at the events of the day would have been nice.
0714843377|5.0|This was a book that I stumbled upon quite by accident.  I was looking for  [[ASIN:1591841666 The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)]] when I found this. I flipped throught the pages and immediately bought it. I have read it cover to cover several time (Truly, something that can be accomplished in a matter of hours). It is a book, to my mind, more like the Dao De Jing in that it doesn't tell a story, but gives you a way to live a better (work) life. It also reminds me of [[ASIN:0143034545 Ready for Anything: 52 Productivity Principles for Work and Life]] in that that book is very \\"Dao\\" like. If you work with or around creative people, I have to highly recommend this book.
B000WO251Q|5.0|There are too many reviews on here already, but I just want to say that once you start reading this book, you will not stop. In the end, your heart will be broken as was mine. I really recommend this book, for I have learned a lot about love and the sacrifices that come with it. Enjoy!
B00117P0HE|1.0|If you interested in watching this movie via download, you will have to wait just like me. As of Jan 2 08 Unbox has not made this available for download. I have preordered the movie and have not been able to download it yet. I hope its worth the wait. Happy New Year..
0399237720|5.0|I purchased this book and plush as a Christmas present for my 2 year old niece.  Although I was not there to see her open the present, my brother said she was very excited, and had to have it read to her right away.  The plush caterpillar was a bonus, as she could hold it while the story was being read to her.  I recommend this cute storybook.
0595440096|4.0|With all the attention Alzheimer's gets in today's media it's still a personal experience difficult to imagine or share. Lisa Genova deftly manages to bring us into the heart of a woman life as she is gaining momentum on that downward slide to total loss and separation from the world she has always known. There is much humor and humanity to offset the pain of Alice's drama, and we are given the chance to empathize and appreciate her family's plight so that we never forget that Alzheimer's in its full fury takes no prisoners and leaves no victim unclaimed. A wonderful book, a superb achievement.
B000WQW988|5.0|Finally, the \\"unplugged\\" session for Nirvana was released unedited on DVD. The decor, the setlist (few hits and many covers) and the vibe make this performance completely unique from any other performance by the band. It was beautiful, yet haunting with the feel of a eulogy for the coming days of Nirvana's existence. On the lighter side, one can't dismiss the special appearance from the Brothers Meat! If you are a fan this is a must see.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I highly recommend this true story. It is greatly inspriational, and well-acted by Will Smith and his son Jaden. Also, google Chris Gardner to check out the whole story of this remarkable man's life!
B0009WFFS6|5.0|this DVD/performance is excellent. it is well worth viewing/owning.  it is wonderful to see these men matured and seasoned, playing the music from long ago with new zip and gusto. let me state here and now that for years i have been impressed by eric clapton as a vocalist alone!! no one ever says that; but its' true! he exudes pure soul!! he would probably be delighted to know that someone thinks highly of him as a singer. nevertheless, his guitar playing shines here as well.     as for jack bruce and ginger baker, both are also without equal; jack bruce having been on death's doorstep some time ago. ginger baker's performance is worth  the price of the dvd alone.    there is no 'arty' camera crap like on cream farewell and the sound is quite good. if you ever liked the cream at all, buy this; its' a keeper.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|My 9y/o son loves this spider. It works best on a smooth surface and definitely wouldnt hold up to rough handling, but overall he is enjoying it.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin is such a strong band.  This album should be part of all collections.  Simple.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, simon and nick were first seen on the big screen together in Shaun which was great, anyone who liked Shaun should love this movie. Its very funny and you'll need to watch it multiple times to catch every joke. Anyway, this is a great movie that anyone can enjoy. ;)
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|This is another fine album from Vangelis. True this may not be as complete as many fans hoped for but the fact that we are  getting a whole new disc (Disc 2) of mostly unreleased material composed back in 1982 is a cause for celebration alone. As previous reviewerers noted earlier, those fans disappointed with this release probably have the rest of the music in bootleg form anyway!  The fact that we are getting any new Blade Runner music at all should be welcome. The third disc of brand new material is a great addition to the BR universe. Thanks Vangelis for returning to Los Angeles 2019.
0446577391|5.0|Please read. I love this book. The \\"Camel Club\\" series is one of my favorite conspiracy theory story lines. I have come to really like the characters that make up the Camel Club. They are likable and funny and I think we can all relate to them to some degree. I do feel you will enjoy this book more if you read the series in order. The ending has me dying for the author to come out with his next Camel Club book.

B000K7VHQE|2.0|Wow. Wow. Are Academy voters sniffing glue? This was art-house ca-ca. Where can I begin? This was one of the most disappointing times of my movie viewing year. For the past 12 months, in my circles, I have heard nothing but praise and accolades for 'Little Miss Sunshine'. These accolades coming from 11 year old girls to 80 year old men, to film school students who praise this as a hidden gem of 'raw-art-situational comedy'. Everyone telling me in every way imaginable, \\"Oh Ken you have to see this movie. It's so amazing. It speaks to so many people on so many different avenues.\\" Hmmm, clearly I am driving on an isolationist freeway.<br /><br />While there were tender moments (Paul Dano (L.I.E.) talking with the gay Steve C. (Dan in Real Life) on the docks about doing what you want to do and screwing morals and society's judgements), I seemed to be wondering when in fact the movie would become something of importance or interest. It failed on all fronts to move me to understand it's purpose, albeit trying to be hilariously funny. While the opening scenes point to a storyline with depth and tender emotions, (save the regurgated use of the word cliche) it guts what little it can delve out, with unwitty righteous ensemble displays of earnest and ill will towards Alan Arkin trying desperately to be comedic. On a sidenote, Paul Dano has intense potential, despite anyone with a pulse being able to play his roll as the quiet, isolated teenage son, he comes through when he breaks his silence with his outburst in the suburbian field, and like Jamie Bell (UnderTow, Billy Elliott) he is not afraid to take on roles which clearly shows the depth of his craft as his performances are dynamic, intriguing, diverse and controversial. We should watch his career with great intrigue.<br /><br />Uniformly, LMS falls on almost every attempt to try almost effortlessly to shine as an art-house indie flick with that sub-genre of psuedo-intellectuals who think films like these are progressively artistic in their endeavors to speak to everyone in some way. In fact it can't seem to find solid ground, save Alan Arkin who's incessant use of the F word was uncalled for in its excess. I am sheltered in believing that this little film was to be a shining, roving example of what is lacking in Hollywood, and how a low budget movie can bring momentum to an often saturated industry filled with massive CGI mega blockbusters and B Movie straight to DVD trash. However, it can only take this movie lover to a certain level of cynicism in wondering:<br /><br />what...all...the...hype...was...about.<br /><br />Ken, January '08ir endeavors to speak to everyone in some way.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Seldom does a movie come around that is as popular or more popular than it was decades ago.  Blade Runner was a Box Office flop when it originally debuted in 1982.  Although the film quickly gained a cultish following of hardcore fans that enjoyed it as an epic Sci-fi classic.  Now in 2007 the movie can once again be enjoyed by it's masses.  A newly remastered collection of five discs has made it's way to hi-def world.  So how does it look and play all these years later.  Extremely well.<br /><br />I am probably one of the few to buy this movie who has actually only watched it once before.  I was a child when this movie first came out and it was hard to understand how good of a movie this is until now as an adult.  The story takes place in a futuristic world set in 2017.  From the first moment on you can realize the epic scale this movie was put on.  A corporation has created these cyber humans called replicants.  Nearly identical to real people they were created to do slave labor.  Although the replicants are very human like and that causes problems.  Thus brings in Blade Runners.  These bounty hunters go searching for rogue replicants.  The replicants have been banned from Earth which means the Blade Runner must find any that find there way here.<br /><br />Harrison Ford plays one of the Blade Runner by the name of Rick Deckard.  Fresh from his first Indiana Jones movie he shows why he is a action/sci-fi star.  Four replicants free themselves from a planet and have come to Earth to search for their maker.  From the first moment on this movie begins to raise philosophical questions.  Right or wrong and should all replicants be retired(killed) for just being a replicant.  Especially when these replicants become so human like.  This becomes evident in the character played by Sean Young named Rachael.  So human like and yet created by science.<br /><br />Most of the movie appears dark in many scenes, night seems to be when people live in this futuristic world.  Despite the darkness much of the color is illuminated in a light blue color which is fascinating to the eyes.  The music sets the tone thru the movie in which it can be rather pleasant to sometimes eery.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of this film is quite a feat.  The sheer beauty of it in high definition is the clear vision that Ridley Scott intended.  From the first scene to the last you can tell this movie went thru more than a once over.  The sound is excellent and really brings out the film.<br /><br />Blade Runner is without a doubt another classic.  Although a sci-fi movie the story delves much deeper than that.  This is a movie that should be seen by everyone.  Any fan of sci-fi or just a good plot will love this movie.  Age has only made it better.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I loved watching ONCE so much I know I will watch it again and again. The simple story of literally making music together is just the tip of the tale that blends brilliantly with the mesmerizing musical genius of Glen Hansard.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
074322454X|5.0|I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas.  Everyone (adults) we know has asked to borrow it.  It has a good reputation for being a true-to-life story.  It seems to be the kind of movie (mini-series) people don't mind watching over and over.

B000UNYJV8|4.0|First of all, I have to say that I enjoyed this film more than any recent film I`ve seen in the past 2 years. Some may say that coming of age is a gentre that`s been done, but This Is England gives it new life. How can you not root for confused pre-teen Shaun? He`s an average kid in 1983 Britain who is befriended by a group of older teens who dress in punk fashions and love reggae music. The early scenes of Shaun and his new friends really convey the jubilation you feel when you`re young and hanging out with peers, however clueless you may be at the time.  All is well until the appearance of ex-con Combo, an older guy who hangs with the neighborhood youth in order to recruit them to racist thinking and the National Front group. Shaun appears to take to his agenda at first, but then the plot goes down another path and there is a more positive ending than one would think.  The film does`nt sugarcoat adolescent behavior-Shaun and cohorts smoke pot and engage in  petty vandalism- but neither does it aim for shock value. Every character is just amazingly real, an archetype of people we`ve all grown up with, no matter where you live or what kind of music you like. Extra points for the soundtrack- lots of Toots & the Maytals. And yes, we learn a bit about the politics of 80`s England, which is fascinating since you don`t always hear about recent history in Europe or America. An underrated gem I know I`ll watch many times.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Cars on Blu Ray truly shines.  I purchased a PS3 for the sole reason to be able to play Blu Ray movies once Disney brought out their newer movies on Blu Ray.    I already own Cars on DVD, but watching the extra detail in the Blu Ray movie is amazing.
B000R7GKQE|2.0|I was truly surprised how such an interesting theme could possibly become so boring.  The only supernatural thing in all the series was the ability of the actors to survive their own selfabsorbance. Pretty faces with soap opera crying (sorry - wet eyes) + that neverending suffering - that manly sorrow deep in characters processing.  such a blabla..

B000UR9T8C|5.0|This was the best one of the three movies. They added a lot to it. I liked the plot. I think people should be over 13 to watch it. It might scare and be too violent for younger kids. I loved it!
B000EK76K8|3.0|This cable only provides Digital DVI and not Analog.<br />It should provide both.<br />The problem arises if one did not purchase a DVI-Digital ONLY cable, it will not plug in. Good thing a reviewer provided a picture of the DVI plug showing it will not accept a DVI (digital and analog) plug.
B00005JPCF|2.0|It was a good plot but I personally don't think that there should be that much sexual content in a children's movie. It was an ok movie overall but if I had kids, I wouldn't let them watch it.

B000OVLBHG|5.0|I saw this film in a theater back when it came out in '97 and saw it as being a clever and thought-provoking satire/social commentary.  I recently watched it again and found `Starship Troopers' to be so chillingly prescient that I cannot get it out of my mind.  While it functions (well, I might add) on a superficial level as an exciting action/scifi romp, this movie leaves you with plenty to think over.<br /><br />The basic premise is that after being `attacked' by a so-called an inferior civilization, all governmental functions, media, information, and public life on Earth become subordinate to the military.  Of course, an early bit of dialogue suggests that those in power assumed their authority in some kind of coup prior to the alien war.  Moreover, the film frames the alleged attack so that a reasonable person would rightly question who the real aggressor is.  Finally, the film suggests that Earth's treatment of enemy prisoners amounts to behavior that Americans once would have labeled torture.<br /><br />If we aren't currently living in a government that is deliberately patterning itself after `Starship Troopers', then we might as well be.  The fact that this film came out 4 years before the false flag operation of September 2001 amazes me beyond words.  I would recommend this film be mandatory viewing for every high school and undergrad student in the U.S. before too many of our younger generation forgets what life was like before the bloodless coup of 2000.
0316548189|5.0|Wow. I am in awe. I just completed this book and am blown away at what an amazing man Mr. Mandela is. What can you say about the man who gave up his small freedoms, but nonetheless his life and his family's life, and gave it all to his country to ensure that all who live there - black and white - can live there with freedom and equality?    I did not know what to expect about his autobiography and definitely was not  sure I could get through the entire book (it's over 600 pages). I thought I would get through maybe a 1/3 of it - but the politics of it all would bore me by then and I'd put it down to read \\"another day\\". Boy was I wrong! I read this book in less than a week! I could not put it down. I was totally moved by Mr. Mandela and his trials and struggles. I am amazed at how he is always able to find the best in people - even those who were trying to break him. His life is one of courage, determination and sheer will. What a sacrifice he and his cohorts made for their country.    I highly recommend this book, and like other reviewers, feel that everyone should be required to read this. If we were all like Mr. Mandela - there would be a lot more peace and hard working people in the world. Did anyone else who read this feel inspired to work out after reading that even when jailed he ran in place for an hour, did fingertip push ups and sit ups to keep in shape? I love it. He is amazing in all sense of the word.
B00062RBOA|4.0|I agree with some reviewers here. The orchestra could be a lot better but I'm sure they all treasure the experience of working with this great conductor. I'm happy to own this DVD. It's one of his last concerts and though things might not go as well as they did when he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic, it's still great music making.
B000YABYSS|4.0|I suspect that the makers of this film, and a large portion of the audience, did not see something utterly frightening here. Having taught in an inner-city high school, I know that:<br /><br />1) Probably none of my students could sit through this film<br />2) Certainly none of them would even understand what this kind of achievement requires<br />3) The vocabulary would lose them completely<br /><br />While the Wiley students were outside the norm of their era, they were nearly all poor kids from poor backgrounds who endured third rate schools and textbooks discarded by the white schools. And yet, despite these apparent obstacles, managed to be learn to read, speak, and think in an exemplary manner. Today, we beg young people to accept our proffered education, spending millions on facilities, books, and programs that accomplish next to nothing. The Wiley teachers had authority. And learners who knew what was at stake. Today's teachers have no authority, and today's students, bred on victimhood and endlessly recited oppression, feel the system is stacked against them and cannot be overcome. Teachers without authority supervising students without interest are babysitters or lion tamers, but they are not, and cannot be, educators.<br /><br />This is a breathtaking film. Oprah's money is well spent, as the look and feel is as genuine as I've ever seen in such a film. Clothing, cars, chairs, wallpaper, coffee cups all reek of the time. And with scenery I would never identify as Texas, I was amazed. Utterly gorgeous. But more than looks, this film has brains. Henry Lowe exemplifies a choice that fewer and fewer young black men make. He is tempted by the music, the smoke, the carnality. But he refuses, putting aside what he wants to do for what he must do. How many young men follow that lead today? Not one of the students I taught could have read Thoreau, let alone argued its ideas. Quoted poetry? Not happening any more.<br /><br />The film is not perfect. It allows the racial animosity of the time to create the obligatory hate whitey scenes. The debates all feel small and trite, with small arguments and way too much passion rather than reason. Civil disobedience is a fine topic to debate; neither side does much justice to their positions. But the idea that circumstances do not control us, opponents do not control us, only our ambitions and willingness to work control us, is not only beautiful to watch but inspiring to share. How can we get today's youths to follow in the footsteps blazed at such cost?e obligatory hate whitey scenes.

B000V3OKW0|5.0|After a couple of decades, I've gotten back to taking the time to listen to music.  I've set up my more or less twenty-five year old Spendor BC1 speakers with some new electronics, total cost not more than $250 for both an AV receiver and a DVD player which I'm using as a CD player.  The sound is very faithful: good recordings sound good, bad ones do not sound good.<br /><br />I mention all of this, because your state of mind and the quality of the sound reproduction make a big difference when you hear the Cello Suites.  If you have the mind space and some decent play back gear you will hear music from Bach and Fournier on this CD set.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|The movie nails the zombie satire, and has just the right amount of English humor.  Love this movie, can't get enough of watching it.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|What a great DVD!  As a professional musician myself, it's a wonderful experience to see one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century  (Bernstein) conducting a talented group of performers and musicians in his classic musical, West Side Story.  The video editing is amazing, and truly captures not only the brilliance of this amazing composer and conductor, but also the challenges of ANY major recording endeavor.  I highly recommend this to ANYONE who loves 20th century music, broadway musicals, the orchestral recording process, and Bernstein.
B000VECAEO|5.0|Amazon had the best price I could find for this season set.  Bought it for a birthday gift for my husband.  He LOVES it!  Great value!!!    [[ASIN:B000VECAEO Seinfeld - Season 9]]

B000YXMMAE|4.0|Radiohead's new album is definitly an awesome album. From the song \\"Nude\\" to the \\"Weird Fishes\\" and the trippy/sad \\" All I Need\\", and the beautifull \\"House of Cards\\". This is one of the best albums of 2008. Some rock fans may not appreciate their unsual ways of marketing their latest album, but I respect them. I recommend this album to any indie rock/alternative/revolutionary type of music. Rock On!

B000YABYLA|5.0|In the past month our local theater chain (we have but one in the Zenith City) has started listed \\"Critic's Choice\\" movies in their theater listing.  The only two movies selected for such an accolade at the present time were the Coen Brothers' \\"[[ASIN:B000YDDP7I No Country for Old Men]]\\" and \\"Juno.\\"  I have already told you everything I know about the former, but of the latter I had heard nothing.  However, Roger Ebert's review of \\"Juno\\" appeared in the paper, and after scanning the first two paragraphs, where he calls it \\"just about the best movie of the year\\" and raves about Ellen Page's performance, I decided I wanted to see the movie.  The accompanying photograph showed Page running down the stairs in front of her house in between Allison Janney and J.K. Simmmons.  Recognizing the cast was enough to confirm my decision and I did not bother to read the caption for the photograph or the rest of the review.  Consequently, I sat in the theater today to watch \\"Juno\\" without any idea of what it was about and I hope that some of you are fortunate enough to have the same experience because with all the time you know what a movie is supposed to be about and you are bitterly disappointed, being pleasantly surprised and falling in love with a movie is pretty sweet.<br /><br />So I am not going to say anything about what the movie is about, although as a teaching of Classical Greek & Roman Mythology I feel compelled to point out that Juno is the wife of Jupiter in Roman mythology and not in Greek mythology, where she is called Hera (Juno is a much better name for the lead character in this movie).  I am going to say that first time writer Diablo Cody should win the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen on the basis of his dialogue in this movie.  At first I was thinking that the dialogue is like a condensed compendium of the sort of language we enjoyed for seven seasons of \\"[[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy The Vampire Slayer]],\\" but that does not do Cody's dialogue justice.  The last time I heard dialogue that made me set up and take notice it was probably Quentin Tarentino's \\"[[ASIN:B000068DBC Pulp Fiction]],\\" but that was diction and timing rather than word choices.  Probably the closest comparison is between \\"Juno\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000UJ48T0 A Clockwork Orange]],\\" and that still does not do justice to the delightful verbiage that comes out of the mouths of these characters.<br /><br />The performance from the ensemble is stellar.  Those who have been debating whether Dakota Fanning or Evan Rachel Wood is the best actress under 21 are going to have to include Ellen Page in the debate.  I recognized her from \\"[[ASIN:B000HCO83Q X-Men - The Last Stand]]\\" and Michael Cera from \\"[[ASIN:B000WZEZGI Superbad]],\\" but clearly these roles go to the top of their resumes.  I know there is a bandwagon for Page for an Oscar nomination, but Janney and Simmons should be touted for their superb supporting roles as well.  \\"Juno\\" is the best thing that Jason Bateman has ever done and he is probably the biggest surprise here, although when Jennifer Garner's name came up in the opening credits I wondered what she was doing in this film, but seeing as how Bateman and Garner made \\"[[ASIN:B000Y7WGOW The Kingdom]] together immediately before filming their roles in \\"Juno,\\" I suspect that might be the connection.  I have to think that everybody who read this script, from director Jason Reitman (\\"[[ASIN:B000H0MKOC Thank You for Smoking]]\\") to the entire cast immediately signup for the joy of making this film.<br /><br />The one thing to be aware of is that you should stay for the end credits just to check out the songs that are in this movie, although once the Antsy Pants start playing \\"Vampire\\" you should want to stick around.  Be forewarned that \\"Juno\\" is one of those movies where you are going to want to get the [[ASIN:B00104W8T6 soundtrack]] on the way home from the theater (or, um, download it as soon as you get home).  The songs done for the movieare by Kimya Dawson, who is a perfect fit for Cody's screenplay, because she seems to be channeling Gilbert & Sullivan through postmodernist sensibilities.  But the great thing about the soundtrack is that all of the key songs that either play in the background or are actually played by (or sung by) the characters in the film are on the CD.  I should also mention that the [[ASIN:1557048029 shooting script]] is out there as well, if you want to read over the choice dialogue again while listening to the eclectic mix of songs on the soundtrack (while waiting for the movie to come out on DVD).ho is a perfect fit for Cody's screenplay, because she seems to be channeling Gilbert & Sullivan through postmodernist sensibilities.

B000UXKYWQ|5.0|I have waited for this to come to DVD. It is a excellent cast and fine acting. Well worth the wait.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I give this four stars instead of five, just because it is in the same class as [[ASIN:B000TJBNHG The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition)]]but doesn't achieve *quite* the same perfection (which is, after all, what a five star rating means). However it is an utterly charming tale, well played and well worth watching, and watching again. Claire Danes is particulary effective at letting us see Yvaine quietly falling in love with Tristan while he still thinks he is in love with the vain and vapid Victoria. We just purchased our copy and are looking forward to seeing it for the third time!
B0002U0UKS|5.0|when i saw the film i didnt know the soundtrack.  it was so emotional and beautiful that i start to looking for to find it in amazon.  the music is brilliant, amazing and like the score in the gretest classic compositors.  i can say that it id a cd that all the lover's music must to have.

B000P12LWY|1.0|This series caters to people who want history served up on a sexy dish, and nothing else. The Henry VIIIth portrayal is crucial, but we get a thin, short specimen of a Henry, and loud, exclamatory rantings, with a lot of sexual interplay. This series ignores the history of the sisters of Henry VIII, and also depicts one of them in a completely inaccurate way.     This is Tudor life as run through the off the top of head e-mails on religion, history, geography, and politics we get so much of these days.    This series should be titled \\"the Renaissance: The Declining Years,\\" aptly applied to the modern world as well as the series it spawned.
0307277887|2.0|This is one of the rare cases where the TV show substantially outperforms the original material. I'm a fan of the Showtime series so I decided to pick up the book - bad idea. The writing is poor and the characterizations are thin to the point of transparency. Someone obviously saw the potential in this (admittedly, the concept of a serial killer preying on other serial killers is great) and turned it into a decent show, but the book was incredibly underwhelming. The show takes its time and fleshes out all the characters, while the book trots along at breakneck speed (and with twee prose) and wraps up unconvincingly. Ignore the book, watch the DVDs.
B000089RV6|1.0|Why do people like Brian Johnson so much? His voice is awful, mustardy, lousy, absurd, stupid, pathetic, lame, horrible and he only screams, dosent sing at all and this is one of the worst hard rock albums ever. they mainly should have quit right after Scott died because he was a bad replacement for Bon Scott too. Dont buy this CD as you'll panic about it later.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Along with \\"Bambi\\" and \\"Pinocchio\\", \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" represents the cream of the first crop of full-length animated stories (as opposed to \\"Fantasia\\", which was not a story) that the Disney studio brought out between 1939 and 1962.  The other efforts from that era included \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", \\"Peter Pan\\", \\"Dumbo\\", \\"Cinderella\\", and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\".  Although each of these last five films have considerable charms to recommend them, as entire works they do not quite reach the levels of beauty, artistry, and memorability of Snow White, Bambi, and Pinocchio.  Snow White was the first of those story films, and its enchantment has not faded with age and modernity.  From the first frame, the viewer is carried away to a created world filled with a wide range of characters, all of whom are fully developed, from the smallest bird to the Wicked Queen, not to mention each of the seven dwarves, all with their own distinct personalities, voices, expressions, and traits.  The film is exquisitely beautiful to look at, with a softness and delicacy of tint lacking in later computer efforts.  The musical score, as was also the case with Bambi, is nearly symphonic in reach if not depth, the voices are closer to operatic quality than Broadway belting, and, of course, the score contains the legendary \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\", tenderly sung by Andrea Caselotti.  Some of the darker moments are truly frightening, such as when Snow White flees terrified into the forest after the Huntsman tells her of the Queen's hatred, and the transformation of the Wicked Queen into the old woman with her basket of apples.  Others moments remain amazingly moving, as when the forest creatures weep outside the cottage windows in the rain as they look in on the seemingly dead Snow White after she swallows the poisoned apple.  The tears slide down their faces as the rain slides down the windowpanes, merging into nature's expression of muted sorrow.    It's not easy to identify the reasons why some of these animated Disney story films succeeded better than others - later efforts also paid careful attention to character development, had catchy tunes, and were pretty to look at.  Yet some of the films have an indefinable magic that others do not, and for some reason, these tend to be among the stuido's earliest efforts. For example, the later \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is a nice film and also utilizes Tchaikovsky's gorgeous ballet music, yet it simply lacks the charm that characterizes Snow White.  \\"Peter Pan\\" is also fun to watch, but Disney himself viewed it as a failure, as lacking \\"heart\\" and failing to capture the wistfulness of J.M. Barrie's original story.    Only \\"Bambi\\", from the 1950s, equals Snow White in the power to move deeply, and even surpasses it in sheer beauty - some of the original cels from Bambi look like Monet paintings.  Pinocchio approaches and nearly catches these two in beauty and certainly is their equal in hand-created animation artistry.  In the early part of Pinocchio, the downward spiralling views of the little town, all the different clocks in Gepetto's shop going off at once, and Gepetto's legs showing through his nightgown when he dances in front of the fireplace, represent the pinnacle of hand-drawn animation achievement, before computers took over.    Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" remains enchanted and enchanting, one of the greatest hand-animated stories ever to come to the screen.  Disney ran out of funds before it was quite completed and had to talk his bankers into giving him more money to finish the work.  Fortunately, \\"Snow White\\" was an instant success, justifying Disney's faith in his creation, saving the Disney studio from banktruptcy, and paving the way for its later works.  Along with Bambi and Pinocchio, Snow White is a must for the serious collector.
B000002HMH|4.0|I like Load it is a great album and is not as sucessful as the other four albums like the Black Album, Master of Puppets, ...And Justice for All, and Ride the Lightning which were better because they play more blues than heavy metal but this is still an awesome Metallica album. My favorite songs are 2X4, Bleeding Me, King Nothing, Cure, and the Outlaw Torn. The next album Reload was awful.
B000K15VSA|5.0|We all know what a ground-breaking film this is -- but in my opinion it needs to be taught in depth in film schools -- using this box-set as the teaching tool.  The story holds up under multiple viewings -- and each version answers questions that another version poses.  It's also a wonderful lesson on how to screw up a great tale in the editing room (...yes I'm looking at you, US Theatrical Version...) and how to create an entirely new film by adding just one scene (...and I bow to you, Unicorn Dream sequence!).  Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on film textbooks, hand each student this $60 case and let the renaissance of sci-fi film-making with complex storytelling begin.      P.S.  I hope every person  who helped create this masterpiece is getting moola from this new release -- but if not, rest assured that we the viewers appreciate the work.
B000P12LWY|5.0|If you want undisputed history there is a channel for it and its called the History channel.  If you want fantastic, mesmerizing entertainment then Showtimes 'The Tudors' is the way to go.  Its got everything a good show should; drama, violence, sex, villians, mystery, etc...    The cast is brilliant, the set is realistic, the filming is great.  I highly recommend it!
B000024D4R|5.0|The order was recieved in a timely manor, it was new, and it will be enjoyed by the person I gave it to. After all he did ask for it by name and title.
B000J103OI|4.0|This movie is very well acted and directed, and a fun, light film.  Anne Hathaway is amazing, and I look forward to seeing her in more serious roles as her career progresses - she is just stunning!  Meryl Strep's performance is brilliantly wicked too, although I wonder if the fashion industry is really quite THAT wicked.  At any rate, it makes for a fun movie!
0307387178|4.0|Krakauer's account of Christopher McCandless' doomed venture into the Alaskan wilderness will certainly strike a cord in the souls of those who foster a wanderlust or yearning to see what lies beyond the sometimes suffocating constraints of life in contemporary society. While Krakauer portrays McCandless as a resourceful idealist on a quest for self-discovery as opposed to a reckless narcissist whose foolishness ultimately led to his demise, it is not difficult to imagine either. (He changed his name to \\"Alexander Supertramp,\\" for god's sake).    Given the facts as presented by Krakauer, it appears that McCandless was in fact a clever young man who survived an impressively long time under the near worst of circumstances. Had it not been for a freak occurence, he would have probably lived to tell the tale of his struggle with nature.    If nothing else, it is clear that McCandless did arrive at some life-changing realizations before meeting his demise, which I'd like to think made the journey worthwhile in his eyes.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|As most of us know its a great movie. The sound was great and picture looked better than the original. Under $20 its worth picking up just in case the old DVD dies. Now I start the long wait for #4.
B00005JPS5|4.0|we have seen this movie 4 times and plan to buy it when it's released. Its funny, innovative and parents can enjoy it too. Much better than the other kids movies out right now. We love Jerry Seinfeld and most of the other voices. We went yesterday with another family and they loved it too!
B000YENUI6|4.0|... and rightfully so, as Viggo Mortensen's naked bathhouse brawl was one of the most brutal things I've ever seen in a film. Other than that, the rest of the film is a sheer pleasure to watch, with great acting turns by everyone involved, especially Armin Mueller-Stahl as the Russian mafia head. I love David Cronenberg and this is one of his more accessible works, though the violence (surprisingly there's not too much of it save for the brawl, considering it's a Cronenberg film and all) may put off some of those who can't get past just the idea of violence. I really enjoyed this one.<br /><br />The DVD for the film isn't feature packed at all, with one tiny featurette devoted to a barely detailed making-of and another more interesting vignette focusing on the tattoos on Mortensen's character and their signification. My main beef with this disc is the lack of a Cronenberg commentary as he's one of the few directors that never fail to give great insight and anecdotes to his work.<br /><br />This DVD is pretty much the film presented in a slightly better than average transfer and a decent sound mix with few extras. I smell a special edition release somewhere down the line but I'd give this DVD a pass, especially if you enjoyed the film.
B000002HEP|5.0|This is \\"it\\" in my opinion for stoner rock albums.  Most fans will say Blues for the Red Sun is the best Kyuss cd.  I believe Sky Valley is without a doubt the best cd.  This album sums up the whole \\"Stoner rock\\" genre.  All of the Kyuss cds are great[ maybe except for Wretch], but this is by far the best in my opinion.  John Garcia has one of the most underrated voices in the music business and Homme is a pure genius with the guitar.
B000V698DI|5.0|Uhh its nevermind, one of the greatest albums of all time, though In Utero is even better, and you should own it.  Don't download a couple of songs; buy the damn album; then buy Bleach, In Utero, and the 2 live albums and Incesticide.  Its Nirvana and if you don't listen to them you don't matter.
B000ZFI1GK|2.0|The deluxe edition offers attractive packaging with a booklet and photos of each band member. It also appends two bonus tracks to the second disk, \\"Hole in the World\\" and \\"Please Come Home For Christmas\\". As far as these ears can tell it's the same recording that the Eagles released on 45 back in the seventies, though since that was one of the few Eagles recordings I didn't buy, I can't say for sure. It's worth the extra cost.<br /><br />The lyrics are the best element of the new songs. Regardless of whether one agrees with every position or issue raised, the better songs are those that veer away from formulaic love ballads in favor of articulate topical observations.<br /><br />Musically speaking, if you play either disk in the background, nothing will leap out to capture your attention. It's all tasteful elevator rock for aging boomers, well-played, well-sung, well-produced, but it fits uncomfortably next to things like \\"The Pina Colada Song\\" or \\"I Go Crazy\\". One number on the second disk you can tell is supposed to be the lone Joe Walsh song but the craggy edges are all sanded down and drowned under a creamy sauce of mood elevators. \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" has a lovely melody but winds down with an aerosol cheese saxophone. Whenever Timothy B. Schmidt assumes the lead vocals one recoils with eerie flashbacks of twee Michael Jackson ballads or a muted \\"Sometimes When We Touch\\".<br /><br />Because most of the tracks pretty much sound like the same song with a different melody, it could have been a single disk. You'll probably cherry pick songs like \\"How Long\\", the instrumental number, and the a cappella number for your portable player or the mix CD for the car.<br /><br />The first four Eagles albums had a distinctive flavor that no other band was able to replicate. I'm grateful that the Eagles have returned but after hearing this four member incarnation of the Eagles I must admit that I was wishing they'd returned with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner in place of Schmidt. To avoid becoming poster boys for AARP a little roughage would be a good thing.boys for AARP a little roughage would be a good thing.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|Magnifique édition qu'un fan de SF doit posséder dans sa collection, avec VF mono et VO sous-titrée 5.1. Le film est parfaitement remasterisé et n'a pas trop pris de rides, sauf le vaisseau spacial trop kitsch à mon gout. Les éffets spéciaux n'ont pas à rougir face à certaines productions Z actuelles. Pour les plus jeunes ce film est sorti en 1956...Enfin vous pouvez également re-découvrir Leslie Nielsen quand il était encore acteur! Aucun problème de lecture sur HD XE1...A+
B000002P6R|2.0|With 64 reviews already registered there's not much more to add but to chime in that although devoted Who fans will consume just about anything the band does, this is a Who album you can readily ignore unless you have the rest of their catalog. A couple of decent songs here, with the rest of the album filler. I eventually sent my copy to the used bins.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|There are certain things you expect from a Quentin Tarantino movie: Groovy music. Pop-culture-and-expletive-filled dialogue. Reinvented iconic actors. Sexy, tough chicks. Violence. \\"Death Proof\\" doesn't fail to deliver in any of these areas.<br /><br />Despite its quirks, this may be Tarantino's most fun and accessible film to date. Compared to the epic \\"Kill Bill\\", it's practically breezy. Tarantino takes a bevy of attractive actresses and a loose horror plot about a maniac stuntman who gets off on killing sexy women with his car, throws in some great tunes, Kurt Russell and a spectacular, amazing car chase scene and viola ... an entertaining thrill ride. It takes a real genius like Tarantino to make it all look as easy is it does.
0439882826|5.0|This is another work of art by Matthew Rienhart.  Every page has a huge center popup and two, three and up to seven smaller pop ups in side flaps that open independently.  The last big popup is cool since you can see Anakins face when it is partially open and it opens to complete Darth Vaders mask.  Also on that page are two side popups with light up light sabers.  Every page is packed with Star Wars information and covers episodes 4, 5, and 6.  I highly recommend this for any Star Wars fan.
B000002ADT|5.0|You can't own this record because this record owns you.  Period.  I only wish I was a teenager again so I can reexperience the pleasure of hearing this album again for the first time.  If Jesus had only one album, this would be it.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|When I picked up this movie, I was under the impression that it would be a typical love story that my boyfriend would hate - aka 'chick flick'. This was SO not the case. It's more a story of a love of music and where that can lead two people. I was highly impressed with this film and it's documentary style. If you are a music lover, I recommend this film. You won't be disappointed.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I never had the chance to see Celine Dion in concert in Las Vagas so this CD really made that wish a reality.  Thank you.
B00004RGUI|5.0|I got this CD as a gift the year it first came out, and even a decade later I enjoy it just like the first time I heard it, it never gets old and boring on you. If you like to meditate but sometimes find it hard to find a quiet place and time to devote to it then this CD will be the perfect match for you because you can just play it on the background after a hard day at work, or in the morning to get yourself calm for a busy day. I even noticed that my 18 months old son calms down when I play it. I downloaded mine to a MP3 and play it at my desk at the office when I need some calmness around me. You will not regret the purchase, the money worth spending. I also own The Forest Piano and love it a lot too (bought that one myself after listening to the cascades).
B000XA5K4I|4.0|While my title doesn't fully capture the true action panache this 86 minute rocketsled packs, it does provide you a quick snapshot of what you're in for; loads of guns, crazy stunts and just plain silly fun.    That is if hyperviolent action movies loaded with black humor are your cup of tea.    All other high-browed audiences only interested in CINEMA (conceited \\"sniff sniff\\" here), PLEASE, don't even bother.  Your finger waving and holding-of-the-noses are beyond tired.    Judge this film the same way you would judge an R-rated piece of anime' - not for the kiddies or the easily ruffled.    That being said (and hopefully taken to heart), I can honestly say this was my greatest guilty pleasure at the theater in 2007.  While I guess it does sort of fall into that \\"gun porn\\" slot, it's really a lot more clever and slapstick-ish (albeit in a sick way, lol) than one might be led to believe. Think \\"Crank\\", but with even better action pieces, music and much funnier.    Outstanding casting too - Owen, Giamatti and Bellucci were clearly having fun, and it shows.    I saw this in the theater, bought the soundtrack (score only, none of the rockin' tunes you hear sprinkled throughout the flick sadly - still good though) and today picked up the blu-ray and it only further crystallized my initial reaction - I truly and totally dig this movie.    And the blu-ray transfer is incredibly beautiful, both visually & sound-wise.  But maybe wait until it comes down a bit in price?  I dunno...perhaps rent it first before you plunk down 30 bucks to add it to your library.    Total shame this didn't do much better at the box office.  I think it was unfairly judged by critical pinheads in the popular press under the wrong light and far too harshly.    Can't wait to see what this director does next.
B000K15VSA|5.0|What a WASTE all these reviews written before the release!  The sound and visual cleanup make this set WELL worth the price.  I am a fan, a huge fan, who saw this in the theater in '82.  I can tell you that it looks and sounds better than that original theatrical debut.  I DO have a 50 inch plasma TV, but not HD playback so no blu ray or HD.  BUT, even normal DVD playback is STUNNING.  I've seen the final cut and its NOT a huge departure, but Ridley said, this is IT.  Will move onto the other 4 versions shortly!
0446605409|5.0|Great read...I finished it in two days! As always DeMille writes a thriller that is action packed and doesn't leave you disappointed in the end! Wild Fire is my all time favorite of his, then Nightfall this is 3rd. It's a great read and well worth the time.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Finally, El Cid to be released in a digital format.  I remember this film from 1961 when as a twelve year old I saw this movie while living on the navy base at Mare Island.  It prompted me to visit the base library to see what I could find on the Cid.  I remember being very disappointed when I found out he wasn't exactly what Hollywood portrayed in the movie.  It didn't matter....the movie is a gem and I saw it again and again.<br /><br />Anthony Mann hit a homerun when he put Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren together on the screen.  The magic is obvious from the first scenes of them together.  A gripping screenplay, great locations, terrific photography, and an excellent score by Miklos Rozsa make this movie a benchmark for film making of another era.  This, as another reviewer mentions, is the last great movie of Heston's to be released.  Shame, shame for it taking so long.<br /><br />Are we too sensitive today for the contents of this film?  Too politically correct?  I hope not.  The peaceful coexistence of Islam and Christianity, a topic touched on in the film, certainly is a topic of importance today.  But that shouldn't be the main idea behind viewing this film.  It should be viewed for the great picture it is.  If its relevant, great.  And what of Heston's stand on the Second Amendment?  What difference does a political stand have on the greatness of this movie?<br /><br />You'll want to buy this one.
0312360266|5.0|I'm so glad I gave this new YA book a try.  I thought it was fantastic and had a hard time putting it down, going so far as staying up late to get in a few extra pages and ending up falling asleep with the book from sheer exhaustion. Zoey is a young girl who wants nothing better than to fit in.  She doesn't fit in at home because she's considered the \\"bad\\" child (even though she really isn't bad, only not as sneaky as her younger brother and older sister).  Then there is the \\"step-loser\\"--her mother's husband of two years.  Since her mother married her step-father, Zoey's mom has changed dramatically and doesn't seem to know how to be a mom anymore.  Things go from bad to worst when Zoey heads to her locker at the end of school to find a vampyr tracker standing by her locker waiting for her, to Mark her.  Zoey is now marked to become a vampyr and has to attend school with other fledglings until her body completes the Change.  Only Zoey's change seems to be different from other fledglings, again, setting her apart when she only wants to fit in.<br /><br />Great book! I thought Cast did a great job with her characters and creating an interesting plot.  There is a lot more going on in this story, including a bit of mystery that Cast & Cast apparently decide not to include in this book but only elude to in the end.  I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am one of those people that has a short attention span for shows that tend to drag along in the middle.     This is not one of them. Every episode was engaging. I never once got bored. Amazing since the show was aired out of order!     I got this set on the day of release, and have since had to replace it SIX times. People fall in love with it and keep the set I loaned them!     If you truly love Firefly, write Fox. Write Universal. Write anyone and everyone who has a part in it and SPREAD THE WORD!     We got a movie from letter-writing. We can do it again and possibly get the series back if we keep it going.     This show never got old for me. I watch it over and over and always find myself enjoying it as much, if not more, than the first time I watched it.     Can't stop the signal, Mal. You can never stop the signal.
0307275639|5.0|Morrie had the most simple, insightful way of looking at life.  Although there were so many life lessons in the book, I was particularly impressed with his thougths about relationships. For instance, how we should look into a person's eyes while we listen to what they have to say.  We have all heard that advice before, but Morrie really brings it home. So often we are thinking about what we are going to say next or concentrating on a completely different subject while a person is pouring out their heart to us.  This was one of the most enjoyable and important books I have read.  My thanks to Mitch Albom for bringing us closer to this phenominal man.    Incidently, all of my family and friends received a copy of this book with their other Christmas presents with a note that I prayed it would bless them as much as it did me.    Thank you Mitch.
B000QCUB8I|4.0|Wow... I was listening to this for this for the first time, and was astonished when \\"Phantom I\\" came on... it's the theme song for the movie \\"Tenebre\\", a late 70s italian horror thriller by Dario Argento, composed and performed by \\"Goblin\\".    Justice added a bit more dance to it, but it's mostly the same as it was. Cool!    [[ASIN:B000000PIV Music Composed And Performed By Goblin: Their Rare Tracks & Outtakes Collection, 1975-1989]]
0307346617|5.0|Pros: Great premise, stays true to Dawn of the Dead zombie \\"rules\\", never dull, not much to complain about technically, a few really good zombie encounters. Characters from all walks of life and all parts of the globe. Excellent and believeable explanations of what happened and why, with only a couple of \\"yeah, right\\" moments. Very fresh style, very easy to read, and lots of variety.    Cons: Interview style prevents deeper character development, and if they are being interviewed then you know the zombies didn't get them! None of the stories last longer than their respective interview, and because of this, some don't fully satisfy. I would have liked even more zombie encounters (more horror and suspense).    Frankly I was tempted to knock off a star because of the non-horror feel this book has, but since it isn't a horror book, that wouldn't make much sense. But some of those stories told by the interviewees just *begged* to be expanded upon. I certainly hope that some other books get written that exist in this universe, as WWZ was very enjoyable, and could be the groundwork for a series of books for zombie purists. THE AUDIOBOOK IS TOP NOTCH ALSO.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I feel Radiohead took a step back for this release.  The songwriting is pretty good in some spots, but quite boring in others.  Here's my review and my 1-10 rating system for each song (1 of course being horrible crap and 10 the highest amount of enjoyment I can possibly get from a tune).     1. 15 Step- A strange beat opens the song, but the vocals are good.  It's a cool song in a very unusual kind of way.  It's not really a techno song, but it's memorable.  8     2. Bodysnatchers- Features a rough, garage-rocky vocal melody and a totally rocking rhythm section.  Maybe a bit too heavy, because the vocals tend to blend together after a couple minutes.  Still, pretty good.  These guys are good at rocking out.  8     3. Nude- I love the slow and dreamy musical section that opens the song.  It's adventurous.  The vocal melody is pleasant and rules.  Best song on the album, especially if you love the lead singers emotional style, despite the fact that certain parts sound quite similar to the Camel song \\"Mystic Lady\\".  9     4. Weird Fishes/Arpeggi- A basic, predictable drum beat opens the song.  Come to think of it, the entire thing is predictable and reminds me of U2 doing a techno song.  That's what it sounds like.  It drags.  4     5. All I Need- Kind of creepy.  The vocal melody is strange as well.  I don't really like it, but the strange vibes are interesting. 5     6. Faust Arp- They copied the Beatles \\"Dear Prudence\\" for the opening bit.  It's pretty, though. 8     7. Reckoner- Repetitive vocal melody and basic drums.  This song possibly shows signs of a band running low on musical ideas.  4     8. House of Cards- Resembles the Bruce Springsteen song \\"My Hometown\\" for its entire length.  It's a light rocker with not a whole lot of melody.  The lead singers high-pitched vocals are kind of annoying here as well.  I got tired of hearing him repeat \\"Denial\\" over and over again.  6     9. Jigsaw Falling Into Place- Features an upbeat vocal melody and a more pleasing vocal style for me personally. 8     10. Videotape- A sappy ballad with a slightly eerie vibe to it.  It's a bit depressing, but nothing alarmingly emotional about it.  They did a nice job copying Paul McCartney's singing style, though.  7     There are no longer any connections to Pink Floyd's atmospheric sound, and instead Radiohead has given us a more ordinary, singer-songwriter type album.  Not bad, but no classic.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This ten hour synopsis of the fighting men of Easy Company of the 101st airborne is someone everyone should see!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Could Radiohead's seventh album have come at a more appropriate time? Arriving on the heels of the major labels' ugly jury trial victory against a file-sharer (Jammie Thomas from Brainerd, Minn., was fined $222,000 for sharing 24 songs), In Rainbows is poised to drive a large nail in the RIAA's coffin and begin the \\"Industry vs. Internet\\" discussions anew. \\"It used to be just [having a release] on a major label was a source of prestige and status,\\" said Danny Goldberg, former CEO of Warner Bros. Records and Mercury Records. But that was before Napster, blogs, Myspace, esteemed indie labels, album leaks, YouTube and Tower Records' Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Slowly but surely, the industry-induced barrier between music and listeners continues to erode.<br /><br />When Radiohead asked fans to name their own price for the download-only version of In Rainbows (£0 was an option), I initially interpreted it as a moral conundrum, a test to see how much they would pay for something they could buy on CD for $18.95. Yet that tiny but powerful phrase on the order screen, \\"It's up to you,\\" seemed only to be the band's way of lowering the aforementioned barrier by placing control in the customers' hands, and another means of connecting with the millions of people who connect so strongly with them.<br /><br />In Rainbows is bound to resonate with listeners, but not in the way you'd expect. It's warm and inviting, densely layered even at a crawl, and surprisingly mellifluous. It isn't that Radiohead veers away from the function they've served since OK Computer (inverting their internalized anxiety with tropes and imagery), they've just found prettier ways to do it, and fans that have already heard the record consistently speak about the music above all else. The first sounds to flow out of the speakers are Phil Selway's serpentine drums, crisply teched-out &agrave; la Battles' \\"Leyendecker,\\" as though Selway were hitting the heads with live wires. Yorke's opening line, \\"How come I end up where I started? / How come I end up where I belong?\\" sounds a bit out of place alongside the Greenwood brothers' comforting guitar-bass interaction and Selway's fluid drum patterns, but when Yorke repeats it near the end, \\"15 Step\\" has morphed into a frustrated, minor-key Insides song for the 2000s, burning with repressed energy, and everything makes sense.<br /><br />Radiohead pays careful attention to their openers as scene-setters, and if In Rainbows can be distilled down to a single track, \\"15 Step\\" would arguably be it. Here and elsewhere, conflicting emotions meld together into a dizzying, dazzling tableau, as the chemistry between the band and their technology-wielding producer Nigel Godrich only continues to improve. \\"Bodysnatchers\\" finds all of them locked in a tight guitar-led groove that threatens to fly off the handle but dexterously maintains its equanimity, like the rocking midsection of \\"Paranoid Android\\" without the acid-tipped barbs. It's nicely followed by \\"Nude,\\" the dreamy comedown that Yorke actually performed in the late '90s and might have ended up on Kid A. In fact, several songs here date to various points in the 2000s, but In Rainbows sounds anything but cobbled together; clearly, Radiohead has gone to some length to fit the larger pieces of the puzzle as seamlessly as the elements in the songs themselves. Even \\"Faust Arp\\"--somewhat insubstantial on its own--works as a fine bridge between In Rainbows' two halves.<br /><br />\\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" is Radiohead at their most conventionally gorgeous, its stacked arpeggios from Yorke's guitar and Johnny Greenwood's Ondes Martenot keyboard pouring themselves over the track like so much nectar. Though Yorke's darkly imagistic language pops up here, the backing music is so dulcet that getting \\"eaten by the worms, weird fishes\\" may just be a metaphor for falling in love. Such smoothly executed dualities are all over In Rainbows: \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" is both upbeat and slightly sinister,while the song's protagonist watches the club she's in become blurry and finds herself caught between dancing and running away. In \\"House of Cards,\\" Yorke intones, \\"I don't want to be your friend / I just want to be your lover\\" over the album's most spring-like guitar lick. That Radiohead is now easier than ever to enjoy on casual listens is actually a big reason why they remain fascinating under the microscope.<br /><br />We might say that In Rainbows is fairly smooth going the whole way through, were it not for \\"Videotape.\\" I surmise that much will be written about this song, since it harkens back to vintage Radiohead closers (\\"The Tourist,\\" \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\"), but also because--unlike the rest of the album--it's spare and direct and heartbreaking, the way Cat Power's You Are Free became more devastating the fewer instruments she used. A lone piano plays in empty space, soon joined by Yorke: \\"When I'm at the Pearly Gates / This will be on videotape.\\" And over the course of the song, instruments and voices conjure a soft lament while the drums grow increasingly warped, like the tracking bars on some forgotten VHS carrying a precious memory. For better or for worse, Yorke and his band are back where they started and where they belong, yet wholly in their element and of their moment. Whether In Rainbows stands the test of time is entirely up to you.s the club she's in become blurry and finds herself caught between dancing and running away.

B000MR9D5E|1.0|One of the discs are a repeat of another. It is missing a whole section of the dvd. Extremely unhappy.
B000Y44LBG|5.0|I don't like crime or violence but I do love good movies!  This is a great movie with not as much blood and gore as The Godfather.  Huge congrats and thanks to all those involved in making this powerful film.  I don't care for lengthy reviews and don't particularly enjoy reading them so I'll just say, \\"Go see it, accept being repeled by the crime and violence, enjoy the excellent acting and cinematography of this story that will keep you on the edge of your theater seat.\\"  Advice:  get your popcorn and go to the restroom BEFORE entering the theater.  You won't want to miss a minute of this film.  THANKS again, Denzel!!
B000002TLX|5.0|I've been trying to track this cd down for quite some time now and Amazon is the only place I've been able to find it.  And for a great price, too!  Thanks amazon!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|THis is for the people that wrote such negitive things about this movie. This is not Disneyland anymore. This is now. If you are not mature enough to man up and face whats real then watch it. But if you want to be the biggest wimp and disgrace to the planet go ahead andwrite your little reviews 'eww it was so disgusting, I suggest you don't watch it.' Ok do you no what the food chain is. Do you know that animals must eat other animals for the whole food chain to survive? Apperently you don't. 'It is filled of kill after kill' no it isn't. Man up, grow up. I can't believe that you have to be told off by a young boy and a young boy is more mature and smarter then you. For everybody else I think you will enjoy it. It is full of buetifull animals and there life styles and habitats.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Very excellent.  Friends had recommended watching it on network TV but my schedule conflicted.  This set is very good.  I have only watched 4 episodes so far and am quite impressed.  Two-thumbs-up!
B000002U94|5.0|Great, I only wish it had a live version of Like A Rock on it!
B000UJBYD8|4.0|I've listened to this cd dozens of times at home and at work, and I still love it. It took a few listens at first, but it grew on me hugely. Certain riffs and solos are absolutely beautiful.    \\"Holy Mountain,\\" where Ian Astbury sounds a bit too much like a resuscitated Elvis, is about the only track I feel could have been left off or replaced.

She is the true definition of the word ENTERTAINER. She's so energetic and her personality shines through each performance.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Radiohead release since OK Computer.  It's the perfect blend of melody and production.  It seems to borrow from a lot of Radiohead's albums.  It has the songwriting of OK Computer, the ambient sound of Kid A, and the crooning vocals of Hail To The Thief.  All in all, it might be my favorite... and since I downloaded it for free six months ago, I'm off to the store to buy it right now.  You should do the same.
B000002J03|5.0|There! I've said it!<br /><br />I can think of no other single compilation of music that defines Classic Rock moreso than this album/CD. It's spectacular, brilliant.... phenomenal.<br /><br />Every cut on this album is a killer. They're all great, no stinkers, no kidding. When this one came out, we were all just bowled over. The most popular format in those days was 8-track (yikes!) because it made us MOBILE. I know that I had to buy three or four copies because the players were always eating tapes. BUT, you could sit out on the hilltop and commune with your honey, sip Ripple Wine, smoke..... whatever, and let the damn thing run all night long, non-stop!<br /><br />Perhaps that's the big deal for me, that is, the nostalgia. But don't be steered off by that. This really IS a great rock album to many ears other than my own.<br /><br />In the end, while I see \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" as the greatest rock album of all time, I personally like Led Zeppelin III better. It's NOT as brilliantly conceived but I just happen to like the songs a little better.<br /><br />Buy this CD. If you've not heard it, (like, if you've been on Venus for 40 years), then you're in for an astonishing treat.<br /><br />And I want to draw your attention to a big bonus if you like Led Zeppelin II. You'll want to hear/acquire this one -- it's unbelieveable!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004U45G Live at the Greek]]<br /><br />Git 'em!!!
0743554434|5.0|People Magazine's 'Best of 2007' had a pithy, pitch-perfect mini-review of Khaled Hosseini's second effort that succinctly captures its triumph:  \\"(it) makes Afghanistan's violent history intensely personal.\\"  And, for the author himself, the review states that \\"(it) proves Hosseini is no one-trick pony.\\"<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />Better than any history book, better than any government's attempt to inform its citizens as to \\"why we're there,\\" Hosseini's book masterfully traces the last 30 or so years of Afghan tumult through two lives filled with pain and misfortune.  It is both heartbreaking and, in the end, transcendent.  As much as I liked \\"Kite Runner\\" (and I've recommended that to countless dozens), \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is every bit its equal.
B000WCDI64|2.0|I looove Amy Winehouse! Her voice is rich, original and refreshing compared to what's out now. But I have to admit, I found the concert to be a bit boring. Not really \\"must-see\\" material. I found myself fast-forwarding through certain parts. I was more interested in just hearing the songs, which I could have done just by listening to the CD. And based on the performances, I would have rather just listened to the CD. There isn't much movement from Ms. Amy on stage, she even seems bored on some songs. I was waiting on her energy level to progress throughout the DVD, but it never did. I was expecting so much from the DVD, it was just kind of disappointing. This could have been a great concert. Her band had the energy, her back-up dancers were energetic, but she didn't carry her wait on the performances. She only seems to be having a good time on a few of the selections. So...my recommendation to all Amy fans would be to enjoy the CD, and just watch her live performances on you tube! (I should have taken my own advice)

B0000027RL|5.0|The early 90's, for me it was my rightful time as a teenager to stick it to the man and rebel against all who came before me. For later generations it seems music is less apart of their rebellion, with the internet being one of the many new things the old-folks don't get.<br />But in the early 90's, popular music was still the medium teenagers used to make their parents nervous. Back then grunge was the perfect sound to announce the restlessness of a generation that didn't understand 80's fluff and didn't think every rose had one thorn, instead we felt that we were being pricked to death by all sorts.<br /><br />That's what people forget about the early 90's, they sucked. The economy was in the tank so I remember teachers doubting the prospects of us student's finding future employment. Issues like the environment and Aids started to gain some light in our popular culture. And to top it all off we had the first war in sometime dance across our television sets with Desert Storm broadcast live and in colour on CNN. So you could imagine we teenagers were just a tad skittish about our prospects.<br /><br />Grunge and its chunky guitars, anti-rock stars and merging of punk sensibilities with larger musical ambitions was the perfect vehicle to attach this incensed energy to. As bombs on television and a recession on the front page greeted use Pearl Jam's Ten was the record that cemented the musical trends impact on the scene. Sure Nirvana's Nevermind rocked everyone at first, but overtime Ten was the record that in my opinion defined the movement. It contained big guitar riffs that defiantly announced each song and unlike Nirvana, Pearl Jam lyricist and signer Eddie Vedder at the time seemed to care more about straight forward narratives that people could grasp. Jeremy was/is a straight forward song about a student killing himself in front of his class. No interpretation of lyrical intention was needed making it a dark tale we all could sing along to. Same with Alive, as after you embraced its epic riff you soon realized that a dark story lay under the surface that was intensely personal to Vedder. In many ways Vedder became the Bruce Springsteen of his day as the tunes that Pearl Jam received the most attention for in the 90's (Alive, Daughter, Betterman) all told stories that were pretty clear to grasp. Vedder was a young storyteller unleashing the less than charming realities he was facing in a way we all could relate to in song. This gave, and still gives, Ten a down-to-earth feel that was desperately needed in the early 90's after a decade of Michael Jackson dance pop.<br /><br />The universal understanding of the tales on Ten gave it a layer of intensity that others of the grunge movement never quite matched. Sure Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and obviously Nirvana made their mark. But Pearl Jam's debut gave use something that took the anger many teenagers were feeling and focused it on tales that validated what many of use were going through. We were looking for a catharsis and Ten provided that in song after song, which spoke to the times we were living in more naturally than what others were providing.

0060575816|3.0|I had high hopes for \\"Sabriel\\" because of the rave reviews here, but was disappointed.  For a book labelled \\"dark fantasy\\" or marketed to young adults, it hardly dealt with any complex issues.  Worse still, it was not very entertaining even as a children's book.<br /><br />The ambitious premise of necromancy and 'binding' the Dead beyond the Gates using the bandolier of bells seemed cool at first, but Nix never fully exploits its possibilities, and his 'plot twists' were unoriginal and the character relationships were never fully fleshed out.  For instance, Touchstone and Sabriel never deal with the emotional issues regarding their positions/birth.  You're left with many unsatisfied questions by the end of the book (like what was Mogget?), but I wouldn't bother reading the other two to find out.<br /><br />Nix's unpolished prose also made reading a little jarring for me, and even action-packed passages did not thrill.  He tends towards unwieldy phrases such as \\"the fox fur-positioned Mogget\\".  All in all, definitely not worth five stars.  I would recommend Emily Rodda's \\"Rowan of Rin\\" and \\"Deltora Quest\\" series for those seeking young adult fantasy fiction but with lusher descriptions and stomach-turning plot twists!  She's an underrated Australian author whose books you simply cannot put down!
0316166685|3.0|We listened to Alice Seybold's unabridged, auto-narration of her own novel.  This must have been a real labor of love for her - it took her five no doubt painstaking years to craft and release 'The Lovely Bones.'  Imagine narrating - for over 10 hours - something where you had eked out and burnished every written word.  I'm thankful that Ms. Seybold read it in a straight, affectless (I mean that in a good way) manner and didn't try to put a unique voice into each character.<br /><br />But her narration isn't the issue.  I did enjoy the first 70 - 80% of the book.  The opening chapters, in particular, are gripping.  At that point, we were hooked.  The rest of the book held great promise.  We extended drives to fit in the rest of a CD.  So, it was very disheartening when the book took a turn that completely lost me.  I can pinpoint the moment:  it's when Susie Salmon 'dropped from heaven' to temporarily inhabit Ruth's body.  The book never recovers from that metaphysical twist.  From that point onwards, the book lost the grip it had held on me.  At the end, I was perturbed that I'd invested ten-and-a-half hours, only to be let down like that.<br /><br />By comparison, during the same trip we listened to Khaled Hosseini's \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"  Despite the unrelentingly bleak nature of that work, by the end I felt that every second invested in the listening experience had paid off in spades.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|There are some jaw-dropping songs on this album - the opening salvo of \\"15 Step,\\" \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" and \\"Nude\\" is worth the price of admission. I'm also a big fan of \\"Faust Arp.\\" But that's about it - the album itself feels weak and a little out of focus. A lot of this is just my taste (as if any of it wasn't): I prefer the world-ending-paranoid-beauty Radiohead to the more personal work. I kind of can't believe that \\"I don't want to be your friend, I just want to be your lover,\\" was even considered a possible lyric by the band, let alone make it into the recording of \\"House of Cards,\\" which I consider an embarrassment. So while there isn't a full album's experience of dread, swooning beauty, and transporting resistance, they pack a lot into a few songs that I'd recommend. It's disappointing to feel like I don't need the whole album, but oh man those good songs are great.
B000056HE9|5.0|I have now watched this film at least 30 times since the first time I was introduced to it by my Mum in 1976 when I was 6 yeas old. My mother called me to come and watch a 'nice film' and she was never wrong about these things! Attention span of a 6 year old is probably 3 minutes but I remember being completely engrossed in it and watching from beginning to end without leaving my seat. Even then I was able to follow the story.     Cary Grant plays a wonderful character with his own special brand of quirkiness that only he could. All the characters are special, my favourite being the Professor played by Monty Wooley, who to me is that kind old gentleman that used to live down your street and you would always get a merry quip, a cheery hello, a wink or even a nod as you walked by. You can read the other reviews for what it is about in detail - I would just say get it and watch it if you haven't as this film is just as good as 'its a wonderful life' (if not better) and if you like that film then you need to watch the Bishop's wife - you wont be disappointed. Get it and watch it with all the family and if you haven't got family near then invite some neighbours round and watch it with them!
0595440096|5.0|Lisa's portrayal of Alice is so real. Following the journey of someone with Alzheimer's can be terribly confusing, but as Lisa writes about Alice's life, you get a true understanding of what living with this dreaded disease is about.  I was diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer's over five years ago and I can relate so much to Alice that it is scary.  Alice's everyday thoughts, battles, struggles, highs and lows are shared with the readers through Lisa's creative style.  If you know anyone struggling with this disease or someone who is a caregiver this book is definitely worth reading.  It lets you get inside the brain of Alice and look at the world from her view -- which is always changing due to Alzheimer's.

I never thought I would truly enjoy watching a series about the war, however, it is so much more.  This depiction revolves around a group of men who develop close relationships with one another.  It is a poignant story that I believe everyone should see.  These men are true heroes in my book and I appreciate and am thankful that this story is being told in a \\"Band of Brothers\\".
B000YPUF9W|3.0|The first two movies only deserve 1 star. This one should get a 3. It's a big improvement but far from perfect or even what a Resident Evil movie should be. It's light on the horror and suspense and heavy on the cheese. Everything from the costumes to the dialog is just so cheesy that it ruins any kind of terror you might experience in one of the games. I think Silent Hill got it right in it's film adaptation. It was more on the dark and creepy side while this is more bright and almost a comedy.

It's big enough to capture attention for a longer time period than simple board books, and entertaining enough that you'll like reading it too.

B00004TS0E|5.0|While being a \\"makeover\\" film, it does well on its own if not compared to the original from way back.  What a great cast.  The also did a great job of allowing you to forget that its a makeover.  Its one of my favorites every year!
0375842381|5.0|I purchased this for my youngest sister - I wanted her to read the series before she saw the film.  Since she's 13 I wondered about whether I should get paperback or hardcover... her books get quite a bit of wear and tear.  Either way, I'm happy with my decision to get these.    Quick book review - I loved the first book, liked the second, and HATED the ending.  But I hated the movie even more than I hated the ending.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|If you are a Rocky fan and if you have lived through the previous movies then you will appreciate this one.  I haven't seen all of them but am a huge fan of the first movie.  My husband has seen all of them and received this one for Christmas.  Yes, it is typical Stallone writing and takes a while to get to the point.  Rocky may never be a classic orator but he makes some very poignant truths.  It is a good movie and I'm glad I viewed it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|My wife saw the Broadway production three times and loved it more each time. Bought her the cast album CD and thought she might like the original DVD.<br /><br />She has watched it several times ( I watched it twice too. ) and it is a very entertaining story. Great for kids and adults alike.

B00117P0HE|1.0|Well I decided that I wanted to get this first thing on Tuesday morning, so when I woke up I could watch this.  Big mistake, it is currently 2 January and it has not been able to be downloaded to my computer, whereas I could have gotten it from Wal-Mart when I was there at 1 am on the 1st.  Anyways this just goes to prove don't pre-order these movies...

B00005JLIU|3.0|Vivacious 1922 flapper Millie Dilmont provided Julie Andrews with one of her best screen roles, and a showcase for her skills as an excellent comedienne.  Career girl Millie loves life ( She says, \\"Now's the time for fun, especially for the new woman. The old rules are out and they haven't made up the new ones yet ... I'm going to learn to smoke, drink and, yes, if I have to, I'll even kiss you back!\\")  and she is determined to marry Trevor Graydon (John Gavin) her square-jawed, stuffed-shirt boss.  In an hilarious attempt to seduce Trevor, Millie lays down across his desk and says, \\"I never read  \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" Was he... Sexy?\\"<br />Chipper, hapless paperclip heir Jimmy Smith (James Fox) is a more obvious boyfriend, but it takes Millie an incredibly long time to realize that.<br />  Unfortunately, even the tremendous talents of Julie Andrews (whom I absolutely adore) can't sustain this silly farce. At 2 hours and 32 minutes, the film (obviously unnecessarily \\"padded\\" for \\"Road Show\\" length; a  common, but regretful, Hollywood practice in the mid-1960's)  is far too long! The film is best at the beginning (Julie sings the catchy title song over the opening credits; Millie and Jimmy meet and dance \\"The Tapioca\\") and the ending (Millie and Jimmy rescue innocent Miss Dorothy (Mary Tyler Moore) from a white slavery racket. To do this, Fox masquarades \\"in drag\\" (shades of Julie Andrews' later comedy classic \\"Victor-Victoria\\"), wearing one  of Millie's most provocative and sexy 1922 dresses). Everything else in between is a bit of a slog. Julie Andrews proves that she is one of the most talented people on the planet, and Carol Channing (as mad-cap Muzzy, a very poor copy of Auntie Mame) proves she is definitely a being from ANOTHER planet altogether! Some may regard Channing (in a role for which she inexplicably received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress) as the epitome of \\"high camp.\\" I always consider getting a gun when Channing is on screen, but opt to run into the kitchen for a snack instead! Ernest Lehman took one look at Channing here and wisely decided she could never sustain the leading role in a musical film. He promptly gave the lead in the film version of \\"Hello, Dolly!\\" (Channing's Broadway role) to Barbra Streisand-- thank God; and nobody (seriously) ever missed Channing in the film of \\"Dolly!\\" The comedy honors in \\"Millie\\" actually go to the incomparable Beatrice Lillie, who ascends to the heights of  inspired lunacy as white slavery dragon-lady Mrs. Meers.<br />  It's a major disappointment that, in the end, Millie appears to lose her spirit, spunk, and independence. She tells Jimmy, \\"I don't want to be your equal anymore. I want to be a woman\\", and she is finally described as \\"a good, old-fashioned girl.\\" Oh, well... the film is a farce after all. And, despite its length, the film entertains in its own silly, old-fashioned, fashion. I saw the stage version, which, without Julie Andrews and Beatrice Lillie, is God-Awful!! Flaws and all, the original movie \\"Millie\\" is a THOUSAND TIMES more fun and entertaining.into the kitchen for a snack instead!

6305897786|5.0|This movie really surprised me as being great in suspense and acting. The two old twins who used to own a copy of the book, \\"the nineth gate\\" in portugal for example are just weird and spot on. The story keeps you interested and takes you to many locations. I loved the detective work of Depp examining the two other nineth gates and how they differ. Who is the mysterious green eyed girl? Why does Balkan, the rich book tycoon, want all three existing copies? What does the nineth gate actually do? Find out!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I adore Charles Dickens, so ofcourse, its my favorite Christmas tale, a real sentimental tale that touches everyone.  This version is wonderfully funny, and Dickens fans like myself will appreciate the narration and the storyline being accurate and well presented, while at the same time being able to enjoy what makes Henson's creations so much fun.  What a great combination, a family movie for everyone to enjoy.  I recommend this very highly.

Planet Earth also has a great diversity of animals, places and scenery so it's never boring.The cinematography and filming techniques are excellent.I highly recommend this nature series.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I was looking for some new music without really knowing what I was looking for. When I found Muse, I fell in love. I'm a sucker for \\"emotional\\" music with all the vocal extremes, predictable heart tugging chord progressions, and a \\"wall of sound\\" where layers of instruments get piled on, and Muse has to be one of the best at all this. And every song is unique and interesting to listen to, the vocals are great and the lyrics (for the most part) make sense (as opposed to Radiohead).<br />They remind me of rock opera at times (sans the cheesyness), but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. :) if that's what you like.
B000669GAI|5.0|My CD arrived as promised on time and in excellent condition. This was a Christmas gift and my daughter loves this CD. It has ALL the best of Pearl Jam on it. So worth the price since it's a 2 CD set. I highly recommend this to all Pearl Jam lovers!
0449227545|5.0|A very interesting, and quite novel, approach to mystery writing.  Ken Follet is one of my favorite authors who never fails to create interesting characters, establish great tension and suspense, and leave you with a few surprises.  This was a very interesting read.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas. He loved it! He spent all day looking at it and has shown it off to all of his friends. The light up light sabers are really cool. Any Star Wars junkie would get a kick out of this.
1594489505|5.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini focused on the lives of two Afghanistan women, Mariam and Laila who had very different backgrounds but shared similiar fate. Mariam was married to Rasheed, a man more than twice her age by her father who wanted to be rid of this illegitimate child. As she was unable to bear a child for Rasheed, she was in his eyes, worthless. Laila on the other hand, came from a well-educated family and due to certain circumstances, was also married to Rasheed. Both women grew to rely on each other for support and encouragement as they were married to a violent man and living in a society where women's right was virtually unheard of.    This was an engaging read for me as Hosseini was such a mesmerizing storyteller. The characters were vividly described and the storyline was strong, leaving his readers wanting for more. After reading Hosseini's bestseller, \\"The Kite Runner,\\" I wasn't sure if he was able to pull another winner. I think that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was even more memorable than \\"The Kite Runner.\\" Highly recommended!
0689865384|5.0|I am an elementary teacher, yet have always been drawn to reading Youth fiction.  I think juvenile fiction does a GREAT job in not only being engaging reads, but also ones that stick with you long after you finish the book.  My all-time favorites are: The Giver (by Lois Lowry), Among The Hidden (by Margaret Peterson Haddix), Petey (by Ben Mikaelsen),and now THIS series!  I read this book within two days, and am almost finished with The Pretties.  These books make you really think about a utopian society and the flaws that accompany them when the government or \\"people in charge\\" make all of your decisions for you.  And like the review below, also reminded me of The Giver. I highly recommend this series as well as the books I mentioned above!!
B000YENUI6|3.0|When I first saw the posters for this movie, \\"Eastern Promises\\", I wasn't all that gung-ho to see it, mostly because I had no clue what it was about. I figured it was probably some romantic drama that wouldn't hold all that much interest for me. Later on, I saw a preview for the movie, and was surprised to discover that the movie dealt with the Russian mob, featured two very talented people in the lead roles, Viggo Mortensen (`The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and Naomi Watts (\\"The Ring\\" and \\"The Ring 2\\"), and boasted a critically acclaimed director at the helm with David Cronenberg (\\"A History of Violence\\"). After discovering all of this, I must say that my interest was indeed heightened; however, when the movie was released it spent so little time at my local cinema that I never had a chance to go see it. So, I was left waiting for the eventual DVD release, but was the movie worth the wait after all?    \\"Eastern Promises\\" is the story of how one action, no matter how benevolent it may be, can be enough to bring your entire world crashing down around you. Anna (Naomi Watts) was living a peaceful existence as a nurse when one night a pregnant teenager is admitted to her hospital, and gives birth, but dies shortly after. With this Anna begins her search to discover if the teen had any surviving relatives that would be willing to care for the newborn child; however, the deeper Anna gets into her search the more frightening the discoveries she makes about this young girl become. During her search Anna comes across the name of a local restaurant owner, but this is far from any ordinary restaurant, as it is merely a front for a Russian mafia family. As she tries to discover the teen's connection to the restaurant, Anna receives a warning from the driver/assassin for the family, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), to basically stay away if she wants to live. Now, Anna must try to do what's right for the newborn, protect her family, try to keep her world from crumbling around her, all while seeking justice for the wrongs that had been committed against the teenage mother at the hands of the mob.    As I stated earlier, I really wanted to see this movie after I found out what it was about. I figured the two lead characters were being handled by two very capable Hollywood talents, and the director had impressed me with his previous effort \\"A History of Violence\\", so I thought that this movie had a decent chance of being very good. After viewing it, I was somewhat mixed on my opinion of the overall film.    The actors were all very good in each of their individual roles within the film. Viggo Mortensen is definitely worthy of any awards he may receive for his role as the driver/up-and-coming assassin for the family. His character Nikolai was incredibly brutal at times, seeming to contain no shred of remorse one minute, then the next he would seem to have a genuine compassion for Anna and her family in his desire to protect her from the evil of his `family'. Naomi Watts was solid as Anna, a nurse who by only trying to do what is right puts all that she knows in jeopardy. The rest of the cast is comprised of various European actors, most of whom I had no recollection of seeing in any other films prior, but each were great in their various roles. Well, I take that back, I had seen Vincent Cassell in a film or two, the most recent was his villainous turn in the thriller \\"Derailed\\" co-starring Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen, and I believe he was much better in this film than the latter, due to his character being much more conflicted and not just a complete bad guy. His character was vicious when he had to be, yet also was so weak in front of his father that you almost felt sorry for him at times.    The story was good, though moved a little slowly at times. It was very brutal and bloody, shockingly so in some places (primarily the shower fight scene), but then other scenes were perfectly tense with great dialogue to move the story along, and then there would be these seemingly unnecessary scenes that just seemed to drag the movie down. There just didn't seem to be a good balance for the film, perhaps if some of the slow scenes had been trimmed up or removed completely the film would have been better.    The direction from David Cronenberg was strong, and he was a suitable fit for the film's gritty, ultra-violent subject matter and the consequences entailed, as he had shown with his previous thriller \\"A History of Violence\\". Sometimes I wonder if Cronenberg is merely trying to shock the audience or make them somewhat uncomfortable with what he puts on the screen. His last film featured very violent sequences that were incredibly realistic and hard-hitting yet not disturbing, but \\"Eastern Promises\\" seemed to go even further with the brutality, especially the shower sequence. That scene in particular was necessary to the story, but could have taken place in some other location. The shower location was probably chosen in an attempt to shock the entire audience with the graphic violence and nudity contained all in one scene. I just have to question whether Cronenberg is including these sequences to better the story or to satisfy a thirst for being as unconventional and shocking as he can be with his movies.    Overall, \\"Eastern Promises\\" is an alright movie, it's nothing great but not horrible either. The movie boasts some very impressive performances from each of its actors, and some of the hardest hitting fight scenes I had seen in quite some time, but some very slow periods throughout the film coupled with an overall dreary tone kept this film from being anything worth watching a second time.    \\"Eastern Promises\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Not much I can say about the movie itself, but let me make a few comments on this release.  As previously mentioned, the black & white version is no different than the 2006 release, and is the best B&W release you can find.  What sets this release apart is the colorized version.  I too am a film purist, and agree that B&W films are meant to be seen in B&W.  That being said, watching this movie in color is a real treat.  The scenes come alive, like never before.  Not only is this colorization better than the cheesy 80's attempt, but it allows you to see detail you never noticed before.  I don't think there is a bigger fan of It's A Wonderful Life than I am.  I've seen it literally hundreds of times.  And watching this colorized version, I saw items in the scenes that had always blended into the background when watching in B&W.  Take off your B&W-purist hat for a second, and give this colorized version a shot.  Even if you only watch it once, it's pretty neat!
B00020HEL6|5.0|This beautiful young lady is a great actor and to my suprise she sings like an angel.  She has a fresh new style to singing Jazz.  One of God's amazing creations.  Thank you Renee Olstead for bringing joy into my life and the life of millions of your fans.  Love you.  Dale....
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The Illusionist tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a magician, who arrives in Vienna with his manager and opens a show. Audiences are astounded by the illusions he performs - making an orange tree grow before their eyes, levitating things, etc. Hearing of these magnificent feats from an impressed Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) decides to attend a performance, bringing with him his soon-to-be fiancee Sophie (Jessica Biel). (Unbeknownst to the Crown Prince, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood sweethearts.) Convinced that he can debunk Eisenheim's tricks, the Crown Prince demands a private royal performance, and the magician obliges. However, once gathered before the royalty and the court, the Crown Prince is unable to explain away Eisenheim's masterful illusions.<br /><br />Perturbed by the magician, the Crown Prince sends Inspector Uhl to find out more about this magician and how he performs such wonders. During the investigation, Uhl himself develops a healthy respect for Eisenheim, even as he learns that the magician has rekindled his affair with Sophie.<br /><br />Although you'll see the ending coming, this is a great movie. What makes it worth it: the performances of Norton and Giamatti. (Particularly, Norton's lovesick magician. I only wish that being apart from me could inspire such anguish in a man.) The effects in Eisenheim's stage shows are nice as well, and I like it that the magician's secrets are not divulged. Also, I love how the script comments on some rather weighty issues. Eisenheim introduces each trick with a philosophical exposition, which serves as set-up, distraction, and fodder for the mind. Through these introductions (and via the plotline itself) movie plays with the notion of death, the idea of truth and falsehood (i.e. fraud), topics of politics/power, and the significance of public opinion.
B000MQ54OO|5.0|This was one of the movies that my wife and I had to get in a high definition format. The story is endearing and sufficiently sappy. The environmental message is gratuitous though understanding at the end. I was disappointed only that most of the extras were not in high definition and duplicated the same from the standard DVD version. Otherwise this movie is definitely recommended particularly to enjoy the surprisingly pleasant vocals from the selected film/music stars (plus tap dancing). Their voices add the soul to the high end computer animation that is a pleasure to see in high definition. Now how many follicles are bristling on that penguin?
0743298039|3.0|The backbone of this story is Vida Winter, the best-selling, captivating, masterful novelist of her generation, telling the secret story of her life to her chosen biographer, a reclusive bibliophile and occasional biographer Margaret Lea.  The principal challenge for an author with writing a book in which a masterful (captivating, eloquent, powerful) storyteller tells her story is that you expect the story within the story to be, well, masterful.  And when it isn't, you're disappointed.  (It's kind of like the old Tom Hanks-Sally Field movie [[ASIN:B00005UO29 Punchline]] where Hanks plays an excellent stand-up comic, but the stand-up comedy in the film isn't that funny.)      This novel starts out that way.  The storytelling isn't masterful, and Ms Winter - as she tells her story - displays the annoying habit of describing all sorts of feelings and exchanges that she would have no way of knowing about.  She describes the dialogues and sentiments of members of her household that took place before she was born or when she was just a baby (without providing a plausible way for her to have learned of them).  Maybe other stories make this mistake, but it stands out here, perhaps because Ms Winter is telling her story TO A BIOGRAPHER who realistically would not unquestioningly accept this kind of speculation.  At other times, when other characters are telling their stories, the author takes explicit pains to explain why the narrative seems smoother or more omniscient than it should.  Those explicit cases (sometimes a little over-explained) make Ms Winter's inappropriate omniscience stand out even more.    Although this is no [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]] [1], the plot picks up with twists and turns and red herrings, and finally the author adds a clever plot twist worthy of the film [[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense]], a twist that allows the reader to turn back and re-interpret the entire story.  Crafting a credible twist of that nature is no small feat, andSetterfield does it well.    I also enjoyed the ending.  The author clearly subscribes to the adage: Give the audience what it wants.  She ties up the loose strings and lets us know what happens to all the key characters with a wink and a nudge to her audience, indicating that she knows she is stepping beyond the immediate scope of the story but that she also knows we're interested in the next step of the characters' stories.    Well done. Not perfect, but well done.    [Note on content: The book has a few non-explicit references to sexual violence (no descriptions).]    [1] I actually read the original Spanish version of The Shadow of the Wind, [[ASIN:0974872407 La Sombra Del Viento]] (by Carlos Ruiz Zafon), and adored it.  I have heard many rave reviews of the English translation.  By no means should you listen to [[ASIN:0143057812 the English audiobook]], which I tried to listen to but couldn't for its over-the-top music and accents.
0937381888|4.0|I bought the book for my wife.  She likes it a lot; and it's full of good information.  My problem is that the author suggests using an aluminum pot and tap water.  Anyone who uses aluminum to process any kind of food item is a moron.  Most tap water has poisonous flouride compounds in it (calcium flouride has some benefit; but the waste material from metal purification that is foisted on our drinking water is toxic).  Use stainless steel or ceramic and for Pete's sake use filtered or distilled water if you value your health.

No more forgetting the dentist appt, music lesson or who is supposed to be where! I love it. Buy it today.
B000VBP38C|5.0|The HD DVD version was purchased.    My wife is thoroughly taken with this version of \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\" As I've seen with other movies the high definition becomes secondary to a moving story and you will forget until you encounter scenes with equisite detailing such as the several parties and painterly images framing the characters on the screen. The movie feels too short at the end and I would've loved to see some of the depth in the original work. I do not begrudge the effort in the cinematic translation as the pacing was excellent and the settings were quite amazing. The acting had some uneven moments but again the story particularly if you're familiar with it, will carry you to the end. Highly recommended. And if you do like this sort of thing, try viewing it with the subbing as certain lines are easily missed and sometimes misunderstood on first viewing.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've always wanted to get this series. I had only caught a few episodes while I was out of town in a hotel room since we don't get HBO at home. However, after seeing the few episodes that I did, I knew that I wanted to see all of them eventually. I finally bought this recently.    While there is great action and pyrotechnics like you would expect in a WWII movie, there also is a lot of heart to this movie as well. The screenplay really tears at your heart strings as you follow these men through training and all the way to the end of the war. Not only do you see their physical pain from their injuries, but you also vividly see the emotional and psychological damage that the war has on them. You are constantly amazed how the men survived this war and you are there with them when they see the friends die on the battlefield.
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|This awesome DVD has all the greats-Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, McCoy Tyner, Art Blakey and all the other Blue Note wonders. But the last performance with Cecil Taylor burnin' the piano is the most amazing performance I have ever seen. His playing is so fast and intense that you'd think he's a Super Human or they mistakenly sped up the video. If you'd like the best Jazz DVD available then this is the one to own.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|Even a bad James Bond movie has considerable entertainment value.  Unfortunately, Never Say Never Again IS a bad James Bond movie.      This time, SPECTRE has stolen a pair of nuclear weapons and is demanding tribute from the world's wealthiest nations.  Bond, played by Sean Connery, finds himself up against a megalomaniac and his own boss, M, who disapproves of the 00 agents.  The 00 boss disapproving of the 00's is one of a number of script elements that doesn't make much sense to the alert viewer.      Connery's acting is the only selling point of this film (Too old?  No way!)  Klaus-María Brandauer as Maximilian Largo is a peculiar villain that certainly comes off as mad, but not really threatening.  Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush is more than threatening, but perhaps she is hamming it up a bit too much for the cameras.  Kim Basinger has all of the beauty of a Barbie doll, but her character, Domino Petachi has only slightly more personality than a Barbie doll.    The Bond women have all of the sex appeal that you expect, but the gadgets, the stunts, the soundtrack, and the climax all fall short.  Viewers with some passion for 007 movies will not want to miss this.  More casual viewers have better options available.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I was hoping to find this movie as entertaining as Kiera Knightly's   Pride and Prejudice but it was not even close.  The actors were  good, but the actress playing Anne seemed too old for the role  (yes, she was very good).  She was supposed to be transformed somewhat  near the end, but I think they just plucked her eyebrows and added  a little blush.  I saw no chemistry between the two leads, and it   did not seem very romantic.  The kiss at the end just seemed weird  because they kissed on a busy street, which probably would not have  happened then.  If you are curious, I would rent it before laying out the money.  It was too slow for me to view again.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I think that this is the best edition of the classic Christmas movie by definition! The video quality is very good for both dvd's, the B&W and the color one.   The story is about a man that spent all his life to help the others; on the Christmas eve, after a lot of big problems, he thinks about committing suicide; at the point his guardian angel comes to try to change his mind....
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'm tired of all the negative reviews from people. Linkin Park does not have to prove anything to anyone.  Even though their previous materpieces Hybrid Theory and Meteora can never be re-created, this album rocks. I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed at first, but the more I listened to the cd, the more I liked it and realised that Mike and Chester are musical geniuses. The depth of their music is unmatched and this is a natural evolution - the frustration, pain, heartache, shouting-out-load, is still there but fans need to tune in their senses to fully appreciate what a great band Link Park is. There is also a new message in this album, just listen to \\"Hands Held High\\"... and understand it!
B0000029AP|5.0|This is the kind of 70s rock album that pretty much redeems all of the worst excesses of that decade. It's a collection of rock songs that really rock, that heave with sweaty bar band abandon and gin-soaked blues swagger, dripping with sleaze and mean excitement, with a few hazy ballads thrown in for balance. It's fun, it's crankable, and it rocks like a mother. I mean, this thing's got the gleefully sleazy \\"Walk This Way\\" AND the deathless rockstar anthem that is \\"Sweet Emotion,\\" for cryin' out loud! It's also got the storming title track, and the beaten reveries of \\"No More No More\\" and \\"You See Me Crying.\\" Plus, there's the sheer awesomeness of \\"Uncle Salty\\" and \\"Adam's Apple.\\" Now there's a rock album!

B00000J7SS|4.0|Electrified, funky, murky, energetic, experimental, pseudo-revolutionary, and controversial in the extreme, Bitches Brew is a double-LP full of dense soundscapes and strange innovation. As one of the founding albums of jazz-rock fusion, it has been criticized by some as representing a step away from jazz's complex harmonic and melodic (not mention rhythmic) ideals, and a step towards more commercial conceits. Of course, one listen to this thing will completely wipe out that notion- not only does this feature some of the most athletic and surreal musicianship ever heard on a Miles Davis record, but this is also not even remotely \\"commercial.\\" I mean, two of these songs last longer than 20 minutes, and the whole thing is full of dense, intricate, and unscalable walls of sound. It's not that it it isn't fun to listen to- at times, it's simply gorgeous- but it's exactly top 40 material.     Sound-wise, it takes the meditative extended compositions of In A Silent Way to a more aggressive (at times funky) level, often slipping into moments that verge on chaos. It's not as raw or as violent as some of his later albums, especially the live ones, would become, and it certainly does have some haunting melodic textures, but the overall sound is often dense and demanding. As usual, Davis takes an ensemble approach to his band, allowing his backing players to shine just as brightly as he does. As a result, there are plenty of show-stealing moments from diverse voices, with multiple keyboards, horns, rhythmic instruments, and a guitar all clamoring for attention. This lends an elastic, fluctuating sort of groove to the proceedings. One song (\\"John McLaughlin\\") doesn't even have Miles on it. Presiding over the whole thing is producer Teo Macero, whose approach to the music was every bit as controversial as Davis': He used the studio as an instrument, constructed the songs out of various studio jams, relying on edits, loops, and studio effects, sculpting and splicing the raw musical material into the album you now hear. One could argue that this drains the music of the spontaneity and improvisational focus that have long been jazz's most exciting features. To a certain degree, this is true, but there's no denying the jam mentality that lurks beneath every note on this album. After all, the raw material was improvised, and Macero's brilliance ensures that the listener never forgets that fact, even when he or she is listening to music that's been spliced and edited.    Which, in the end, leaves us with the music. How does it measure up? Well, for the most part, it's a strange, hypnotic, dreamy (sometimes nightmarish) sonic invocation. It's full of surreal clouds of rhythm and rollicking rhythmic vamps, as well as moments of eerie tranquility and raw beauty. It sounds, in many ways, like the album's cover. The songs spill into one another, creating an organic feel that supersedes any track listing. Listen to the shifting throb of \\"Pharaoh's Dance,\\" the way it ebbs and flows from a labyrinthine cluster of keyboard runs to a lopsided rhythmic lurch, setting the tone for the title track (and indeed, the rest of the album). It's really stunning stuff- I give it four stars only because it doesn't really manage to sustain interest across its double-Lp size. By the end, it's more of an unsettling sort of aural wallpaper or a dream soundtrack than a truly compelling listen. But it's still incredible stuff, and a classic album. Enjoy!
B000GFLEJA|4.0|This is a really good movie, Johnny Depp at his best. This is definitely not for everyone, if you find drugs or drug culture offensive, this is not for you.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens  DVD<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver is superb in this sequel to the movie Alien.  In this one:<br /><br />It is nearly sixty years (57 to be precise) after the conclusion of \\"Alien,\\" Ripley and Jonesy the cat are still quite happily sleeping away in their cryo-freeze compartment aboard the shuttle after sending the first alien out the airlock. The film opens with a salvage crew opening up the shuttle and finding her and the cat! After she's awoken, she learns that she's been floating around for fifty seven years and the company she works for is none to sympathetic to her cause, basically blackballing her. Unbeknownst to her, the \\"company\\" sends someone out to investigate her story and not too long thereafter nobody from the planetoid is heard from again. This of course prompts the company to send the space marines and Ripley as an advisor to find out what happened to the people.<br />What follows from there is one of the best and most intense Sci-Fi action/thrillers to have ever been made and I would highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films in this genre!<br />This review is for the June of 99 DVD release. I found that the THX and 5.1 Surround worked quite well for this film. The seventeen minutes of the restored footage for this film is quite seamlessly added to film and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of this movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Sigourney Weaver, science Fiction, and good action movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2007
B0000E6XH3|4.0|Interstella 5555 was directed by Leiji Matsumoto and set to the music of Daft Punk's Discovery album.  The film tells the story of the abduction and rescue of an interstellar pop band.  One of the most fascinating things about this film is the fact that the story is simply told through the animation, music, and minimal sound effects; there is absolutely no dialogue in the film.  However, the story is told effectively without dialogue, and the viewer can understand what's happening.<br /><br />The DVD has a few special features on it: interactive play, character files, animation editing for \\"Digital Love,\\" an interactive game, karaoke versions of three songs, the trailer for the film, and biographies of Leiji Matsumoto and Daft Punk.<br /><br />Overall, Interstella 5555 is an incredible viewing experience.  I would highly recommend this film to anime fans, regardless of whether or not they are fans of Daft Punk.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|There are only two shows that I have ever watched that have turned me completely obsessed. The first is Smallville, and the second-which has surpassed the first by far-is Supernatural. Tragically hilarious, this is probably one drama that just does not get enough credit. Both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki play their roles perfectly. At times I forget that they aren't really brothers, because they act the way that my sister and I do when we're together. The guest stars fit well into the framework, and somehow the creators managed to find the correct balance between humor and the seriousness of what the Winchesters are dealing with. The effects are awesome, and let me not forget the rocking soundtrack that has turned me on to a whole new breed of music.  Though this is definitely not the first successful show in the horror/drama genre, as far as I'm concerned there has yet to be anything like Supernatural. This is TV at it's best.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|The pricing is awesome and the material included in the package is unbelievable.<br /><br />Thanks to Warner Brothers for putting this together.<br /><br />The movie is great and will have an important place in the history of film.<br /><br />Beyond that, this package gives you all the different cuts of the movie.  The quality of the HD material is great, both audio and video.<br /><br />The interviews and background material are very interesting and insightful.  They provide a great background on how the film was conceived through its release, and all that takes place in between, and how the movie was made. If you are interested in film, acting, or technology, this material is better than what I have found in any other movie.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and I knew I had to have it in my collection.  This movie is off-the-wall, filled with action, gore, and comedy.  I give it a thumbs up!
B000VSBX34|2.0|This film is so silly (even by Beatles standards), it's almost unwatchable. There's not enough music (or at least their good music) in the movie and the silliness just takes control and causes the movie to hit the ground at 500 miles per hour.    A much better movie is Hard Days' Night. It's silly too, but the music overrides most of it and makes it a pleasure to watch.    It looks like about 15 people tried to write this mess. Are there funny parts? Yes. Is some of the music good? Yes. Is it worth renting? Probably.    But, don't buy it. Unless you are a hardcore Beatles fan, you'll only watch it once.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This set is one of the most amazing things i have ever seen. I watched the whole series on TV here in Australia, and fell in love. I couldn't wait for every week, and was a little anoyed when there was a gap of about 3 months between series 1 & 2. But when i saw that it was coming onto blu-ray i could not wait. One thing i can't believe is all the small things i missed in the backgrounds and in the shadows. Blu-ray picks up the smallest things, and this set is just brought to life. There are some parts where i have actually had to pause it for a minute as i felt a little motion sick. You get this feeling of moving when they do sweeping shots, like the way imax makes you feel (just a little smaller). This series is one of the most amazing things to be filmed you can see why it took 5 years to film. A definate buy for all blu-ray owners.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|Great album.  Very relaxing and beautiful music from Enya, as always.  Love it!
B000EGF0B4|5.0|Boy Oh Boy, what a joy. i have only seen this film very very recently and you have no idea what an impact it has had on me. Never before have  I seen two characters protrayed on the screen which have touched me in such a meaningful and extraordinary way. I cried and cried as their love affair fell apart from the 1963 Brokeback meeting right through to their final separation.This was a stunning love affair, between two people, which moved from the physical and sexual side onto a higher and more meanigful plain in the end. Sadly it took death to move it into this realm, a fact that all of us seem to forget, and with death it is to late to act.    I fell in love with Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar right from the start of this story and I can only take my hat off to the fine acting, wonderful script, and fantastic music.    It made me question myself and question my life. Am I Jack or Ennis, I dont know, but I might just Twist Again and play my hand a little differently in the future as we wont be coming back this way again.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This guy is an idiot.  This is the same mimbo that claimed to have invented the Internet.  He is not a scientist.  He's not even very smart.  I can accept info. from people with out PhD's etc. if they are smart and/or self-educated.  He is nether.  Global warming is a myth and has not been adequately proved by competent scientist.  There are so many conflicting reports and data out there.  The weather goes through cycles.  Should we reduce greenhouse gases?  Yes.  But it is not the conflict this idiot says it is.  This is one of those things politicians use to make a fuss that draws attention to him or his party.  He and some folks on the other side of the isle are proof that the 2 party system is broken. God save me from all the crooked and stupid folks inside the Beltway in DC.  The folks that should be in political office can't get elected because they are not crooks and won't take the money from Big business and Special Interest Groups.  I wish that they had hit the White House and Congress etc. instead of the  WTC buildings on 911.  We'd be better off.  These guys get away with murder (literally). Clinton and Ted Kennedy both killed people and LBJ had someone killed when he was running for office in Texas.  Someone once said, \\"we get the government we deserve\\".  I think they were wrong.  I hope they were wrong..
0606208356|3.0|This `roman à clés' is very original. The hero continues to live in different historical periods and undergoes a sex change.  However, it is written in an emotional, sentimental, superlative style: `society in the reign of Queen Anne was of unparalleled brilliance. The graces were supreme.'  Except for the first period, there are no conflicts, only rather superficial descriptions of the mood and spirits of the times. For V. Woolf, `to give a truthful account of society ... only those who have little need of the truth, and no respect for it - the poets and novelists - can be trusted to do it, for this is one of the causes where the truth does not exist.'  `Orlando' is a perfect flight from reality: `But let other pens treat of sex and sexuality; we quit such odious subjects as soon as we can.' `Whigs and Tories, Liberal party and Labour party ... should be left to the historian.'    This book is a clean, introvert, aristocratic, long ode to pure Beauty.  Only for Virginia Woolf fans.
0805079831|1.0|I cannot imagine a worse presented and argued premise.  Devoid of logic and journalistic integrity, Naomi Klein just insists that what she says is true.  Reversing causality from 'It is, therefore I want it' to \\"I want it, therefore it is', Klein uses every rhetorical trick in the bag (excepting facts, analysis and logical argument) to turn her hallucinations into conspriacy theory and asks the reader to accept it as real.      While any democrat will 'defend to the death' her right to say whatever she wants, to take her any more seriously that Lyndon LaRouche is laughable.
0446613444|4.0|Although The Black Ice is more than entertaining, it is not the most thrilling Connelly novel I have read.  I have been reading the Harry Bosch novels in no particular order and have enjoyed each one.  The Black Ice has more lulls in the action than most of the other ones I've read.  It is well written and we learn more of Harry Bosch in this novel.  He travels to Mexico in pursuit of a killer and the answers to mysteries involving several murders.  The travel and the transition to a foreign place requires more writing of the scenery and background than Connelly usually includes, so this creates the lull in action.  The mystery is a good one and Connelly provides an excellent twist in the conclusion.

0143038419|3.0|Dear Liz Gilbert, I asked for your book as a gift, and read it almost non-stop. I thoroughly enjoyed the first part and much of the rest of it too. Yet now that it's over I find the final effect is a sort of hollow thud.<br /><br />The first sinking feeling of something not-quite-genuine was with your announcement that you had an advance for the book before beginning your trip. I don't know what you promised would happen in your travels, but I imagine you had to by golly find God or bust. Did you pre-program your experiences to fit the pre-paid book?<br /><br />You are a good writer and some of your passages are beautiful and profound. Why go for the cheap effects? I don't want to know that you fantasize about Bill Clinton while masturbating! And isn't it tacky to reveal the exact moves of a man who may or may not end up as your husband? And what's all this disingenuous nonsense about protecting the privacy of your ashram? Anyone who ever got near the guru trail knows exactly where you were, and would know it even if you had not dropped a staggering number of clues.<br /><br />What disappointed me most was your claim near the beginning of the book that by the end of it you would be \\"very close to God, indeed.\\"  Somehow, it doesn't feel that way. It feels more as though you are awfully excited about being so darn cute and being able to attract so many people into your orbit. Well, you are young and you are talented, but maybe you could hold off on being a spiritual teacher for a few more years.<br /><br />And in the meantime, will you please stop using \\"commenced\\" when you mean \\"proceeded\\"!
0812971825|5.0|A novel that ponders some very deep questions -- One's relationship with God -- God's relationship with a community and the world. \\"That the world was now coming of age and needed a new understanding of God.\\"    This novel sneaks in great advice such as \\"being fretful so often that joy seemed impossible\\".  Much more than \\"a chick novel\\".
0743486285|5.0|I am and always will be a huge fan of Motley Crue.  Reading this book makes me wonder how in the world they did what they did.  An absolutely amazing read and very well written/put together story.
0060512806|2.0|I threw in the towel around page 550 something. I just didn't have it in me to make it to the finish line. This guy apparently will _not_ use 2 words when he can use 7. It _is_ well plotted and the author has a keen eye for details and arcane and interesting facts but oh man, is this guy wordy. He is the anti-Hemingway.     I love cryptography, which is why I picked up this book. I also enjoy anything related to WWII. The author uses a fairly standard present time-past time storyline. He does a credible job of weaving together a number of characters and several storylines.  He teases with a really interesting set of possibilities as to where his story might go involving Nazi gold, Nipponese gold, the Enigma machine, global communications and data and especially cryptography.     As I said, I got to around page 550 and just ran out of gas. He simply cannot get a grip on the narrative and after awhile, it just gets boring. He never delivers on the implied promise that things will start to pick up  get going. Cut this book in half, I mean it; take away about 450 pages and it would be a terrific techno-historical thriller but I found it just too long.  If you are graduate of the Evelyn Wood School of speed reading, you'll probably love it.
1582701709|2.0|Their concept is accurate--you can bring whatever you want into your life; however there is so much repetition in this book, mainly different people saying the same thing.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Absolutely awesome CD. It is not my personal favourite out of the Muse CD'S I own, yet it is still great in it's own way. I bought it after hearing Knights of Cydonia play at least once everyday on our local radio station here in Seattle. (107.7 The End)     My favourites include Starlight,Soldiers Poem, Assassin and K.O.C.    If you like Muse, I recommend this as an addition to your music collection.  But please don't let reviews that state comparisons between them and Radiohead PUT YOU OFF from buying their music. In my opinion they sound nothing like them. I am originally from the UK temporarily living in the USA and would say the only comparison between Muse and Radiohead is that they are both British too!!! That's about it!  The best thing to do is see for yourself :)
B000TLTUL0|4.0|I know a lot of people have difficulty with musicals. It is hard to sit and watch a story and have the characters spontaneously burst out into song. I enjoy them; good musicals serve to transport me and I suspend belief and go with the flow, accepting and expecting the characters to begin bursting into song at any minute. We have been fortunate to have a revival, of sorts, of the genre in the past decade or so. Disney Animation has kept up the tradition, but as far as live action musicals, the genre died for a number of years. With the release of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" (love it or hate it, there is no in-between), the genre was reborn. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" led to \\"Chicago\\", leading to \\"Dreamgirls\\", which led to \\"Hairspray\\".<br /><br />Many may not be aware there are actually two kinds of musicals created for Broadway and film. Traditional musicals tell stories and the characters sing songs to express their emotions and to move the story forward. There are also `operatic' musicals. These feature the characters singing throughout most, if not all, of the story. Stephen Sondheim's \\"Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is an example of an operatic musical.<br /><br />Even with the rebirth of the genre, musicals are a difficult sell. \\"Hairspray\\" did well because it featured a bunch of young stars kids and tweens are familiar with. \\"Chicago\\" did well because it received a lot of awards and positive press. But they are difficult sells which is why they probably always feature funny, romantic or upbeat storylines. So, I was surprised to learn \\"Sweeney Todd\\" was going to be made into a film. It isn't particularly romantic, although much of the story has to do with one man's love for his wife. It isn't particularly funny, although there are some moments of black humor. And it certainly isn't upbeat.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp, director Burton's muse) returns to London from prison. We learn Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman, perfectly cast) sent Todd away on a false charge because he coveted Todd's wife. While he is in prison, Todd's wife dies and Turpin takes in his daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) as his ward. When Todd returns, he meets Ms. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) his former landlord and sets up shop above her meat-pie emporium, where she proudly sells the worst meat-pies in London. Todd intends to use his former profession, barber, to extract his revenge on Turpin, Beadle (Timothy Spall), his accomplice and any one else who gets in his way, including an Italian barber (Sacha Baron Cohen) who may steal some of Todd's business. But as Todd's body count rises, he and Ms. Lovett have a problem. What do they do with all of the bodies? Ms. Lovett comes up with a plan and her meat-pie shop becomes more popular than ever.<br /><br />Directed by Tim Burton, \\"Sweeney Todd\\" seems to have found the perfect director for the subject material. Really, the only other director I can think of who might have been a better choice is Peter Greenaway. Both directors treat the screen as a canvas and create beautiful imagery out of strange and sometimes dark material. Burton brings London, in the mid 1800s, to life, complete with black smoke, dirt and grime. It is hard to imagine people living in this London, Burton's recreation, but that is sort of the point. Unless they were rich and well-off, like Judge Turpin, people struggled to survive. As the film begins, and Todd sings of London being a cesspool of despair, Burton makes us believe in this image of the world capital. This may be the first time I have seen London depicted in such a dirty, grimy state. Other stories have shown this side of London, but those films are usually filled with night scenes. Burton places much of the action in \\"Todd\\" during the day. There seems to be perpetual fogs (both literally and figuratively) hanging over the city, making everyone appear a little more sallow and unhealthy.<br /><br />As soon as Todd returns to Ms. Lovett's shop, she offers him one of \\"The Worst Pies in London\\" offering us more of a glimpse into her life and the life of people living in this city. This moment also helps to establish their relationship. Lovett appears to not recognize her former tenant, he does look quite different, but when he reveals who he is, she states \\"I thought that might have been you.\\" It is Lovett who reveals what happened to his wife and daughter, and this sets Todd on his murderous rampage. But Lovett is also a little attracted to Todd, even in his murderous state. Apparently, there are worse catches in London, the London of mid 1800s anyway. Maybe this is still true today.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is always a strong actor. He may not appear in the best movies (see the third installment of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" for an example) but he is always at least interesting. In \\"Todd\\", he further explores a character he has been building with Burton over the course of their careers. Sweeney shares similarities with Willy Wonka, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and all of the other characters Depp has played in Burton films. Burton really found his muse when he started to work with Depp and any actor would relish the opportunity to play such strange characters. It is really a match made in heaven for the two men.<br /><br />In \\"Todd\\", Depp also proves he can sing. He isn't a formally trained singer, but he does a remarkably good job with what must be a difficult role. If you look at \\"Todd\\" a little closer, Depp, an American, has played many Brits throughout his career, but to sing with a convincing British accent? That is the challenge and Depp pulls it off very well. I have a feeling this is the aspect of the role that attracted Depp to the film in the first place. He has played very strange men before but never one who sings. And to sing an operatic score? That is an even greater challenge for an actor.<br /><br />As Todd, Depp shows us the rage simmering beneath the surface. It is really amazing to see this anger boiling, threatening to pour out at any moment. But Todd knows he has to keep it in check. He has a plan and if he lets the anger overtake him, his plan is ruined and he will never be able to avenge his wife's death or rescue his daughter. Turpin is his goal; everything else is just a stepping stone to vengeance.<br /><br />He also seems to regard Ms. Lovett as a necessity. He clearly recognizes she is more interested in him, perhaps in a romantic way. While he doesn't seem to share the level of ardor, he recognizes he needs her to keep his plan moving forward, so he plays along, stringing her along until he reaches his goal.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's wife, is not a classically trained singer either and she does a very good job. Ms. Lovett is not quite as desperate as Todd, at least on the surface, but she certainly has things she desperately wants to have happen. She sees in Todd perhaps her last chance at happiness, strange as that may seem given the barber's psychotic tendencies.<br /><br />Has Alan Rickman ever turned in a bad performance? Like Depp, he has appeared in mediocre films, but anytime he appears on screen, he brings the project, good or bad, to life. Because he has played many villains, it was nice to see him play Emma Thompson's husband in \\"Love, Actually\\", a character similar to the role he played in his first big film, \\"Truly, Madly, Deeply\\". But villains is what he is best known for so, in \\"Todd\\", Rickman plays Judge Turpin, the man who changed Todd's life forever. Turpin's reason? He coveted Todd's beautiful wife and had Todd locked up, taking his daughter in as his ward. The beautiful wife? She couldn't stand the thought of living in Turpin's hands, so she committed suicide. When Todd returns, he sets his eyes on Turpin and would love nothing more than to get him in his barber's chair and give him a very close shave.<br /><br />During the intervening years, Todd's daughter, Johanna (Jayne Wisener) has grown into a beautiful young lady. Naturally, Turpincan not hide his feelings and tries to keep her hidden from the eyes of handsome young men. When this proves too difficult, he decides he will marry her. This man is truly despicable and Rickman manages to portray his desperation in a convincing, fascinating way.<br /><br />Timothy Spall plays Turpin's oily henchman, flouncing around, always at Turpin's side. When he is on his own, he knows his position carries a certain amount of power and prestige, which he isn't afraid to show.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen plays Signor Aldolfo Pirelli, the Italian barber who may provide some difficulty to Todd, stealing some of his business and hindering him from reaching his goals. The moment Cohen appears on screen, everyone recognizes him and the accent he uses is so ridiculous, it is hard to separate the actor from the role and it proves more of a distraction than anything else. It smacks of stunt casting and brings the film down a bit.<br /><br />There has been a lot of comment about the amount of blood in \\"Todd\\". Necks are slashed and a lot of blood flows, but the blood becomes cartoony and comical very quickly. It is ketchup red and flows so freely you can't help but laugh. Also, what else would you expect to see in a film about a barber who uses a straight razor to cut people's necks? In the middle of the film, as Todd works towards his goal, so many people fall victim to his razor during one musical number it is difficult to feel queasy.<br /><br />\\"Sweeney Todd\\" is a very good film. Definitely not for everyone, it is an acquired taste many will appreciate.He has a plan and if he lets the anger overtake him, his plan is ruined and he will never be able to avenge his wife's death or rescue his daughter. Turpin is his goal; everything else is just a stepping stone to vengeance.    He also seems to regard Ms. Lovett as a necessity.

Also, what else would you expect to see in a film about a barber who uses a straight razor to cut people's necks? In the middle of the film, as Todd works towards his goal, so many people fall victim to his razor during one musical number it is difficult to feel queasy.    \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is a very good film. Definitely not for everyone, it is an acquired taste many will appreciate.
075640407X|5.0|I absoulutely love to read fantasy novels however I hadn't read anything in years that captured my attention and held me enthralled all the way to the end.  I may be over reacting but to me this book ranks right up there with the classics of Tolkien and Lewis.  And this is the authors first book.  Highly recommended.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|I guess its safe to say Radiohead have finally run out of that eclectic weirdness everyone loves....As always, I give kudos to the band for their recording techiques...but...this new release is nothing more than them ripping off newer Queens of the Stone Age, Dredg, and U2.  Shame on Radiohead for copping to the \\"hip\\" low-fi sound thats 'in' these days... Why doesn't it work for them? The singing...that whiney voice ONLY works when the music is ultra-experiemental... here its nails on a chalkboard.
B0000029GA|5.0|I figured since everybody else reviewed one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all-time that I should add my two cents as well even if it's 2008....this is a timeless work of art before you....it will never get old....compare it to the mona lisa...from the intro \\"The Genesis\\" right on through Nas's vivid NYC narrative will hold you captured...With Production By Pete Rock,Large Professor,Q-Tip and Premier....you have some of the greatest beat makers to ever do hip-hop along with one of it's greatest lyricists...how could this FAIL...As Nas himself says \\"I Excel then Prevail\\".....nuff said....if you don't have this in your collection then you don't have a complete hip-hop catalog....
B000W07EKW|5.0|Excellent series. This collection was well worth the money. If you like Matt Damon you will No Doubt like this. Non stop action. The ONLY bit of important information about this series is that it MUST be watched in order: Bourne Identity, then Bourne Supremacy and then The Ultimatum, otherwise it will ruin the plots.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Not only is the concert awesome but the additional behind the scenes interviews and secrets of the show are worth every penny that I paid to buy this. You get the see what happens behind the lights on every song during the concert...including those fast custum changes. Celine is awsome and this is a real treat for any fan.

0099457164|2.0|Not a bad read but the ending (so called) leaves the reader suspecting that the author gave up on the book and went out for a cup of coffee, while leaving some beginning writer to complete the book in 25 words or less. What a let down.
038572179X|3.0|I suspect that most people who read Atonement will either love the first half of the book and hate the second half, or vice versa.  I deeply value a book that is able to balance an exciting, fast-paced plot with intense and thorough character development.  Unfortunately, in Atonement it felt as though, while McEwan is talented in both plot and character development, he is unable to combine the two.  The first half of the book describes, in oppressively long-winded detail, the events of a single day through the eyes of several charatcers.  While the reader is truly able to see into the minds of the characters, the plot itself suffers from mind-numbing inertia under the weight of all of the detailed descriptions.  Then, as exciting and fast-paced as the second half of the book was, it almost seemed superficial and glossed-over next to the first half.  I am glad I soldiered through the first half since the book as a whole gave me food for thought, but I can't say that I particularly enjoyed the experience.  The interesting and very deliberate way that the author switched points of view might make me want to read it again in order to pick up the subtleties, but I'm afraid I can't bring myself  to wade through that first half again.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|AT FIRST I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT AND I ONLY BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE GAMES. AFTER WATCHING IT I WAS COMPLETLY PULLED IN BY THE CATION AND THE PLOT.

6304779356|5.0|When their mom gets divorced, brothers Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric looking impossibly young and pretty) move with her from Phoenix AZ to their grandpa's semi-rural property outside the funky California beach town of Santa Clara.  Sam is about 14 and already suffering withdrawal-from-television.  He's not pleased when Mom drives them past a billboard welcoming people to town and he happens to see spray-painted on its backside:  \\"Murder Capital of the World.\\"  Plus, there seems to be a million flyers up all over town for missing people.<br /><br />Grandpa is a twinkly, eccentric taxidermist.  Mom is sweet-natured but understandably preoccupied with how she's going to get a job.  Sam and Michael who is about 18 are free to roam town.  What a town!  A never-ending amusement park, a boardwalk along the beach stuffed with colorful characters, bonfires on the beach.  Free concerts!  People of every ethnicity and size and shape!  All this is believable and great to look at:  it makes you wonder why Sam misses Phoenix.  Michael, in particular, is enchanted to spot a gorgeous hippie girl named Star (Jamie Gertz) at an outdoor concert.<br /><br />But Star (and a mysterious little boy whom she carries around like a pet) are in the orbit of a group of flashy teenage trouble-makers on motorbikes led by David (Kiefer Sutherland also looking impossibly young and pretty).  These lost boys, led by David, latch on to Michael in a competitive-threatening-possessive way.  Soon he's getting reeled into their dangerous company.<br /><br />Sam starts to wonder if something more metaphysical is going on.  Could these lost boys be ... vampires?  Is his brother in danger?  He's a comic-book fanatic and soon he runs across the Frog brothers, also about 14,  who help their folks run a comic-book store.  The Frog brothers are paramilitary in a hilariously over-the-top way, and self-proclaimed vampire experts.  Soon they are helping Sam to prepare for the epic fight of his life.<br /><br />This is a movie to be watched over and over again:  for its exciting sequences, fast-moving plot, and especially its laugh-out-loud funny moments.  It's a cult classic for good reason.watched over and over again:  for its exciting sequences, fast-moving plot, and especially its laugh-out-loud funny moments.  It's a cult classic for good reason.
0440238609|2.0|I believe in Pullman, not his publishers. Good Books. Great ideas. Should have had the courage to publish the British edition, not a dumbed down American edition.
0099765217|5.0|It appears that the negative reviews of this book are from people who consider this book as an actual theory for reforming society.  The result of Tyler's goals would obviously result in the horrible death and chaos.      However, if you are want to read an entertaining, different, and interesting piece of fiction then this book is great.  If your looking for theories on reformation of politics and society, look elsewhere.      In addition, this is one of the fews books that actually compliments the movie instead of making the movie look worse.
0938045695|1.0|It would be a good product if it concentrated on the exercise and not on Pavel's posturing and drivel.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|I had to have this soundtrack specifically for \\"The Lighting of the Beacons,\\" \\"The Houses of Healing,\\" and the extended film's sequence beginning with \\"The Mouth of Sauron and ending with \\"The Crack of Doom\\" (*especially* \\"The Crack of Doom,\\" so much more powerful than the theatrical version's soundtrack song \\"The End of All Things\\", which just hacks the emotion to bits, in my opinion).  \\"Anduril\\" is also one of my favorites, but I was pretty happy with it even in the theatrical version soundtrack. It's a little bit different (not in a bad way) in the extended version.    Of course, the extended versions of the films are the \\"real\\" versions to me, so if you're a theatrical-version-only fan, the extended version soundtrack might not be for you.
B000P12LWY|3.0|Yes, it's true, The Tudors is painfully inaccurate in its presentation of this particular period in British history and there is really no excuse for that.  Reference material is more than abundant not to mention that scholars and amateur historians on this subject are legion, but I admit that though certain things made me cringe and shake my head in disbelief, the naughty person in me, loved this sleazy, 16th century romp, populated with the best looking cast ever assembled for a television series.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is so indescribably beautiful as to stump the senses.  For crying out loud, Henry was thick (obese in his final years, but athletic and rugged in youth) in build and with reddish-brown hair.  JRM is a wisp of a fellow that though cuts a great figure, doesn't look capable of knocking a pre-pubescent girl off a horse during a jousting match, let alone a man.  This series should be viewed with a very open mind and not judged too harshly.  Showtime is hardly promoting the series as the non plus ultra of historical bio-pics. In short, it caters to modern sensibilities (not all together a good thing) and tastes.  If it were meant to be a valuable addition to the oeuvre of films dedicated to British monarchs, it would not have been produced by Showtime but rather by PBS or BBC.  If you want accurate historical depictions of the Tudor period, I highly recommend A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS or ELIZABETH R or BBC's brilliant mini-series from the early 1970's THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII.  However, if you want a real guilty pleasure that makes for both engaging and titillating watching and makes little to no demands on the viewer check out The Tudors.  But, again, be warned, it is not a history lesson, even in the most liberal use of the term.  This is history re-written for the sake of entertainment and little else.  Don't cut up your library card just yet, as you'll be needing it should really want to know what happened in the fabled court of England's arguably mosticonic monarch.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Excelent sound, picture and all. On my tv DLP 1080p looks great all the bright colours but not as well as the dark ones.   It's worth to have it unstead of regular DVD. I'd buy it again if back in time.
B000O1799U|4.0|I think that most people are familiar with the story even before seeing the movie - about a singing group similar to the Supremes, with enough fiction to keep the writers and producers from getting sued by Diana Ross or Berry Gordy.  Also, Jennifer Hudson's loss on American Idol and subsequent Oscar got tons of press.    The movie lives up to most (although not all) of its publicity. There are one or two scenes that run a little long, most notably, the scene where Effie finds out that she is being cut. My wife thought that the singing was too shrill, but I don't agree - but the scene is VERY intense and gets a little unpleasant to watch because Effie's pain is that intense and that raw.  And Jennifer Hudson is THAT good.    The truth is that it's a very good story, carried out by a cast that is extraordinarily talented.  Eddie Murphy hasn't been this good in years (except for the Shrek movies) and he shows why he was able to sell so many years ago.  Jamie Foxx handled the role perfectly without turning it into a caricature.  And Beyonce demonstrated that she CAN act.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I bought this dvd even knowing it was used, I took a chance because I had my doubts of what was going to come out of a used one. The result is as well as the ones I care and have in home.  This concert is a must to have, excelent sound and picture. I really like it.

B0002XMF5I|5.0|This awesome Metal release is not for bubble gum glammers. This is evil screaming heavy metal at its best. If ever you questioned Black Sabbath's status as a heavy metal band then question no more. This album is like many Rush releases as you need to give it a few listens to get it, but once you get it you will always want it. In my humble opinion, if there was ever a time for Black Sabbath to change their name then this was that time. Perhaps A Blacker Sabbath would be more suffice. This album is often overlooked and should be part of any metalhead's collection.
B00065MDSQ|4.0|Do these 30th anniversary editions come in digi-paks/cardboard sleeves (that scratch CDs when the CDs are removed), or are these 30th anniversary editions in nice, sturdy plastic jewel cases?    Thanks.    Long live KC!

0440418569|4.0|Of all of the Dark Material Series, The Amber Spyglass was certainly my favorite. The creativity of the writer in all of the books within this series is excellent but the last books really takes the cake. For me, if a writer has to spend a great deal of time explaining the mindset of the characters, then they are not always doing their job within the rest of the story.  Pullman does a great job spinning a yarn without the need to bloviate about the charters state of mind. The adventure speaks for itself...as it should be!
B000OLGCHA|5.0|Harry Potter's soundtrack always rocks.  This one is no exception.  Every track will bring me to the darkness and magics of the movie.  Like track 14, it is very dark.  Also, there are some relaxing moment.  That will be track 1.  This also includes the sadness music which is track 12- death of Sirius.  Overall, good music.
B000WCBPOG|1.0|Well intended with some good moments, but mind numbing when taken as a whole. I can't tell you how disappointed I was with this project in general. Don't waste your time getting the whole CD....listen to some samples, download a few hilites and be done with it.

0385720920|1.0|This was the first book of Chuck Palahniuk's I've read, and I can't say I'm a fan. I pretty much figured it out, so the ending just sucked. It was disappointing and a major waste of time. I do like his description of things, but was disappointed by the story. I have heard that Rant is a good book, but I am not sure I will give it a shot.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|This is simply an immensely enjoyable and timeless interpretation by Sir Colin and crew of one of the greatest operas ever created. What I love about this particular production, is not only the flawless performances, but the undeniable humor and playfulness of Mozart's deceptively simple but utterly powerful music and Schikaneder's ingenious libretto that often sends the audience into uproarious laughter. While the profound scenes and themes of Die Zauberflote are presented brilliantly and effectively (Dianna Damrau is truly incredible as the Queen of the Night), this cast doesn't take themselves too seriously. The caricature of Monostatos is hilarious! The sets and costumes are exquisite but not too much for your senses to appreciate. Any fan of Mozart or opera should buy this DVD as soon as possible and then get comfortable for a few hours pure musical and theatrical bliss!
B00000IN5G|5.0|Children of Bodom's second album, Hatebreeder, is, by far, one of the best metal albums out there, and their best CD, second only to Follow The Reaper in my opinion. Back in 1999, while most of the world was creaming itself over manufactured boybands like N*sync and the Backstreet Boys, there were really only a few albums that were released that year that deserved so much recongnition. Hatebreeder is definitely one of them, with complex guitar solos, fun lyrics, rumbling bass, pounding doulbe bass, and amazing keyboard melodies.<br /><br />This album is more neoclassical than the albums after this (they still retain the flavor, but this one has it the most front and center), and the result is truly ear candy that would impress anyone. The lyrics are mostly about death and a few are about personal issues (like Towards Dead End). The musicianship is top-notch, and it's amazing to think about how young these guys were and how talented they were back then. Alexi's black metal scream sounds more polished on this album than Follow The Reaper, which was always my one issue with that album. Here, it sounds perfect.<br /><br />Every song here is worth listening to. Warheart has a thumping bass intro with a very catchy chorus, as does Silent Night Bodom Night. SNBN has one of the best dual guitar-keyboard solos I've ever heard. Towards Dead End has a lot of riffs that sound like they belong in a Vivaldi or Bach song, which gives it a very unique atmosphere. The band's self-titled track, COB, has lots of catchy melodies and great solos as well. The harpsichord interlude in the middle is my personal favorite part. And then, there's Downfall, which has lots of amazing riffs, too, as well as another incredible dual guitar-keyboard solo, and a great classical guitar-keyboard arpeggio interlud, which kind of reminds of Dream Theater's Erotomania. All of the songs are great. Those are just my favorites.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good example of Scandinavian metal, Hatebreeder is not a bad choice at all. It's a gem that will shine throughout metal history, and unofortunately, probably remai in obscurity when it comes to most of the world. If you like this band, I also recommend Skyfire, Eternal Tears of Sorrow, Kalmah, and Norther, which play similar styles as COB.t all.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|So, it's been 4 painful years without a new Radiohead release. We were treated with Thom Yorke's solo album lost year, which was a welcome release, and definitely a good one, but I, like many other people I'm sure, we're ready for Radiohead to release a new album. They went on an extremely long tour and showcased many new songs, so they were bound to put out a new album sooner or later. So, finally, they release In Rainbows.<br /><br />So what is In Rainbows like? Well, I'll tell you this first off: It's a huge departure from the cold, other-wordly synth electronic that was present on the last 3 albums. The electronica is still there, but it gives off a different atmosphere. In Rainbows is much warmer, and a lot more quirky than previous Radiohead release. I have no doubt that many people will try to compare it to their previous albums, and say \\"this album sounds like [insert album title here]\\", but to me, this is something completely new for the band. Now, to be fair, the lyrical content is similar to the themes of Ok Computer: Fear, pessimism, and the feeling of concern and worry. But the music can't be found on any of their previous albums.<br /><br />The first song, 15 Step, shows off their new electronica style. The beats are quick and pedantic, and in stark contrast to those on Kid A and Amnesiac. Bodysnatchers will surely become a fan favorite, with it's crunchy guitars and frantic jazzy drums, as Thom Yorke sings \\"Make A Sound/move back home/a pale imitation/with the edges sawn off.\\" It's probably my favorite song on the album. Then there's Nude, which starts off with alien synth, and goes into a relaxing ballad with some rather depressing subject matter. The album picks up its pace with Weird Fishes/Arpeggi, with quick drums and mellow guitar riffs. I'm not really sure what the lyrics mean, but if I had to give any interpretation, I'd say that it's about conformity. There's a lot of reverb and echo in Thom's voice in this song. The keyboards in the song is very atmospheric. It's almost a collaboration of all sorts of sounds: rock, indie, jazz, electronica, ambient, and avant-garde. It's deiniftely one of my favorite songs off the album. All I Need is about isolation and/or the obsession with one person. It's the first song on the album that has any reminescence of Kid A or Amnesiac. It starts off with a lot of atmospheric, almost gothic, organs until it turns into a gorgeous synth-driven doom crawl. There's alos the use of xylophone in the chorus, as well as some sweeping effects. Faust Arp makes use of violins and slide/acoustic guitars. It's the shortest song on the album as well. Reckoner has a lot of jazz influence, but, unfortunately, doesn't stand out that much. Like others have said, the melody is pretty much the same throughout the song, and the lyrics aren't really anything to behold. However, it's by no means a bad song; it just doesn't stand out as much as the others. The album is saved with House of Cards, which reminds me of Weird Fishes/Arpeggi, in that it's a big collaboration of sounds, with droning synth, echoing vocals, mellow guitar and bass lines, and a simple, but catchy drum beat. The atmosphere is very chilly, but that's welcome, since it varies things up a bit, and it works well for the song. The next song, Jigsaw Falling Into Place, is another acoustic-driven song, but it's much more upbeat and varied than Reckoner. It's a very catchy acoustic pop song. I think it's about the troubles of every-day life, and how when you're about to forget them, they all come back to you and ruin your day as Thom sing \\"Just as they play your favourite song/As your bad mood disappears/No longer wound up like a spring/Before you've had too much/Come back in focus again\\". You can always count on Radiohead to sound human, which is something a lot of the fake, manufactured bands of today can't do as they try to look and appear like they're gods. Videotape is a relaxing piano ballad. It's hard to say what the lyricsmean, but I think it's about a person who's dying, so he's making a videotape for his loved ones to watch him say his famous last words. It's a very beautiful song and my second favorite off In Rainbows. In contrast to the somber piano, it has a lot of chaotic, electronic drum beats, which may or may not be symbolic. Weird Arpeggi is pretty much the same thing as House of Cards. Why this is I have no idea, or understand why they even wanted to do this. Nonetheless, it doesn't take away from the greatness of the CD.<br /><br />Even though it took forever for Radiohead to release an album, and even though there will tons of rumors about them breaking up, and even though they teased us by saying \\"Yeah, uh, we have some new song. Don't know if when or if we'll release them on an album.\\", I'd proudly say that In Rainbows is one of the best albums of 2007 and a worthy addition to their catalogue. Of course, you can be sure that all of the purists will be anal and tell you that this album sucks because it's not an exact clone of Ok Computer. Don't listen to 'em, and judge for yourself, although I have a strong feeling that you'll like if you're a TRUE Radiohead fan.<br /><br />P.S. What's funny is that I wouldn't even know that this album exists if my aunt, who's also a big Radiohead fan, didn't give me a copy of the album while it was being offered online only to buy.nk it's about a person who's dying, so he's making a videotape for his loved ones to watch him say his famous last words.

0061092037|4.0|I classified this Archer novel as \\"fun\\".  A story of a lifelong battle between two newspaper tycoons, it is fast paced and entertaining.  I enjoyed it immensely.
159562015X|4.0|I have been working on my weaknesses, and making progress.  But this book helped me undertand the value of leveraging my strenghths, as well as identifying them.  Yes, some stuff I knew, but I also learned some.   It will help you understand what you bring to the table, and if your teammates also complete the assessment, it will give you insights about how to work with them given their different characteristics. For $15, it's a no-brainer, go for it!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I bought the movie because I believe someday (hopefully in my lifetime) it will be looked at as the driving force that brought Universal HealthCare to the U.S. of A. Thanks, Michael Moore, for your courage and beliefs!
B00004SGNM|2.0|Putting the material aside, this disc is a dissapointment. If it had that \\"analogue\\" sound that just blows me away on many other SACD releases which were done better and in 5.1, (i.e. \\"Brothers in Arms\\" by Dire Straits), I'd find myself reaching for it 'time after time' for many hours of musical bliss. The singer does not come into my listening room but remains shrouded behind a digital realm. Alas, it is just ok and with not enough discernable improvement over a regular cd, especially considering the price, so it will likely spend it's life on a shelf undisturbed but for the occasional dusting. Recommended only if the artist is special to you.
B000XA5K48|3.0|Then this movie would get one star. This movie is extremely silly and is filled with some unbelievable stunts. Shoot em up kind of surprised me because I didn't expect some of the outlandish scenes. You got a guy who kills like 1000 different foes, while eating carrots and holding a baby?!??!?! The only thing that made this movie fly was that it was funny. It also helped to look at Monica Belluci. :) There is absolutely no plot to the movie at all, just a lot of bullets and some very ridiculous action scenes.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is one of my Mom's favorite movies and I ordered it from Amazon early in the Christmas season as a gift. Saw it on reduced price a few days later and was very impressed with Amazon's willingness to issue me a refund for the price difference. This is a lovely movie and it is always nice to get a bargain at Christmastime! My impression has been that shopping with Amazon gets easier and better every year.    The movie is pure fantasy, with beautiful scenes and unbelievably beautiful people. A real pleasure to watch. Also interesting to see goofy Jack Black as a surprisingly believable romantic lead. Very sweet movie, I highly recommend it.

B000Y179KO|5.0|This CD is awesome!!!  I usually buy used CDs or just download P2P files. I am very impressed with this album. I've been an Eagles fan since the early 70's. I wish that they would get back together until the end of time.  These guys really know music in it's true form & have worked very, very hard to accomplish all the harmonies & mixes they've done.  It is a vision of mine that these guys will be one of the greatest musicians in heaven because of their focus on reality & what this country has become. Listen-up folks!!! Can you be still long enough to grasp the messages in the lyrics? .....God Bless,  John.... (wirenut), ...(prairiemutt)
B000SQJ2SC|5.0|This deserves much credibility and alot of honor not since Kanye's mom Dr. Donda West passed (RIP), while listening to this album and following the previous two CDs that been grammy-certified, I felt this was it this time no interludes, no surprises. All we need is the music. He'll lead you thru getting \\"Stronger\\" and following and living \\"The Good Life\\", hitting more home runs as \\"Barry Bonds\\" and to the reach of being a \\"Big Brother\\". Every song is still Qualified Genius-ology. No where compared or matched. The album will lead you thru the journey of them all: John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Aretha, Michael Jackson, Duke Ellington, James Brown, Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Kurt Cobain, Tupac, Earth Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone, Boz Scaggs, and thru the use of film and tv score work of Henry Mancini, James Horner, John Williams, Ennio Morricone, Lalo Schifrin, Georgio Moroder.
B000002LN9|5.0|The premise of Eric Clapton's live double compact disc, `24 Nights,' to quote Derek Taylor's liner notes, was an undertaking \\"to celebrate his (Clapton's) music at the Royal Albert Hall over 24 nights with first a four-piece band and then a nine-piece and then a batch of blues giants and finally a mighty orchestra...\\" For any fan of rock, but especially for fans of Eric Clapton, there is lot to like about `24 Nights.'<br /><br />Recorded live in 1990 and 1991 at about the same time as Clapton's studio release, `Journeyman,' `24 Nights' includes classics such as `Badge,' `White Room,' and `Sunshine of Your Love' recorded with the four-piece band, blues standards `Have You Ever Loved A Woman' and `Hoodoo Man' with the blues band, `Pretending' and `Bad Love' with the more contemporary nine-piece band, and `Bell Bottom Blues' with the National Philharmonic Orchestra.<br /><br />As one would expect, many of the musicians with whom Clapton surrounds himself are legends in their own right.  The various line-ups feature such Phil Collins, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Jimmy Vaughn, and Johnnie Johnson.  There are quite a few names familiar to the fans of \\"Eric Clapton and His Band\\" releases and tours, including Greg Phillinganes, Nathan East, and Ray Cooper.  Even Jamie Oldaker, who was a part of Clapton's bands during the 1970's and early 1980's on the studio release `Backless,' among others, is the percussionist for the `24 Nights' blues band.<br /><br />Each of the bands produce a sound that combines both Clapton's blues and \\"Cream-y\\" roots as well as Clapton's mature and confident style reminiscent of the more recent Clapton releases.  The `Sunshine of Your Love' track is the Clapton/Bruce/Baker edition on steroids.  The energetic `Pretending' and `Bad Love' jump right through the speakers, while the version of `Wonderful Tonight' featuring vocalist Kitty Kissoon is literally erotic.<br /><br />The only criticism for `24 Nights' is relates to the collaboration with the orchestra.  While other rock band/orchestra associations really seemed to have clicked, Clapton's effort just misses the mark.  On the `Bell Bottom Blues' track, in particular, the band and the orchestra seem to be about a half or quarter note off, although `Edge of Darkness' is fairly powerful and quite a bit more on.  Maybe it just took a while for the band and the symphony to warm to one another.<br /><br />In all, `24 Nights' is bottled lightning.  Clapton's guitar riffs shoot right out from the tracks and, with the exception of the symphony tracks, the music and the musicians are tight.  `24 Nights' provides just about any music fan with a great listen, while dedicated Clapton fans will appreciate both the classic style as well as the experience and the maturity of a true rock legend.estra associations really seemed to have clicked, Clapton's effort just misses the mark.

0679720200|2.0|This book is required reading in many high schools - I'm grateful that I'm  a long-time out of high school, and nobody required me to read or even understand this short and depressing novel.<br /><br />The story is about a man (early thirties?) named Meursault.  In the beginning, he finds out that his mother has died.  He isn't sure exactly what day she died, or even how old she was and it doesn't seem to matter much to him. He confesses that he wasn't sure if he loved his mother and shows no appropriate emotions at her funeral.  Soon after he admits that, he's not so sure he loves his girlfriend either. He thinks that at one time or another, all normal people wish that their loved ones were dead. He tells a friend that it is his nature to let his physical needs get in the way of his feelings. What feelings? Then claims that he is like everybody else.?<br /><br />Near the end of the story he declares that he has never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.  It is only in facing his own demise that he displays any emotion.<br /><br />Okay, so Albert Camus is trying to communicate his belief that there is no absolute truth, that everything is relative and that reality is only found in those things that we experience physically.  I can buy into everything is relative theory, but without emotions, feelings and spirituality, is there any such thing as physical reality?
0451208706|5.0|This is my favorite of Ken Follett's work...    Like many of his earlier novels (Triplet, The Key to Rebecca, etc) it is fast paced and engaging. These are the precursors to the \\"techno-thrillers\\" of the late 1980s. But this is deeper....    This novel addresses the themes of WW1 and how it came about. It lightly touches on the contradictions of 'the establishment' versus the 'peoples movements' of the early 1900s and how the war came to be one of class struggle instead of one government vs another. As Feliks would have said, it was 'war killing people' instead of 'people killing people'...    Follett does a TERRIFIC job of showing one man's twisted understanding of war, politics, and the evolution of those times - but written for our world and understanding. Feliks, the protagonist Main Character, is not a communist but rather an anarchist revolutionary who represents the life as it \\"could have been\\" vs how it became. He sort of shows how life and politics could have changed our world had not it become a struggle between the capitalist West vs the communist East...duno if that makes sense, but its what I see in it....    Even if you don't like politics, you can like this book as a spy or adventure novel...and still get something out of it as a historical novel....    I highly recommend this book....
0156027321|3.0|The first half of this book takes place on land.  It deals with Pi's growing up, coming of age, understanding God and religion.  This part was wonderful. I enjoyed the all the scenes in the zoo.  I loved his discovery of different religions.  One of my favorite lines of all time comes when he is discussing Jesus and says, \\"You can keep your sweaty, chatty Son.\\"      The second half of this book takes place on the sea.  It was boring, monotonous and full of self-pity.  Now, granted, if you were stuck on a small boat with a tiger for months, it would be boring, monotonous and you would be full of self-pity.  I'm not arguing that this part of the book wasn't realistic.  I'm just saying it wasn't enjoyable to read.  How many different ways can the author say, I'm bored, hungry and want to die.  Understandable... I just don't want to read it that many times!
0805082662|5.0|This book has been a joy for my four year old grandson.  It also comes with a CD with the book read by Gwyneth Paltrow.  Zachary loves the rhythm of  the prose.  It is  lyrical to read aloud.  He has learned most of the words, through repetition.  But he can also recognize many of the words out of their context.  A great book for beginning readers.
B000YAA6AU|3.0|Holly and Gerry Kennedy (Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler) have been married nearly a decade and when he is suddenly torn from her, she gets a gift from beyond - monthly letters penned by Gerry to help her get through her first year without him. They urge her on to do stuff she normally wouldn't do - like attempt karaoke again after a disastrous past try; go on a trip with the girls; and he even encourages her to not close herself off, but to open herself up to the possiblility of falling in love again.<br /><br />Lacking a simple thing as chemistry between the two lead characters (or the potential new love interests for that matter), the movie version of \\"PS I Love You\\" falls flat and never really takes off. From the first ten minutes - one of their many arguments designed to show what a \\"real\\" couple they are - to the cheesy flashbacks to highlight their initial meeting. It just made me wonder how the heck they got together. And Swank's attempts at displaying her grief in a prolonged arc just didn't work - it was too contrived and unbelievable. She was channeling Diane Keaton in her annoyingly infamous crying scene in \\"Something's Gotta Give.\\" I could not be more disappointed in the movie. I was expecting a romantic comedy-drama in the vein of \\"Ghost,\\" but instead it was just a mediocre story. The only time I shed a tear was when she kept calling his phone just to hear his voice - it seemed really natural, unlike the majority of her performance. Other stand outs were Kathy Bates as her mother and Lisa Kudrow providing comic relief. James Marsden (Spike from \\"Buffy\\") as Gerry's best friend is completely unrecognizable in a very understated performance.<br /><br />Side note - did anyone else wonder why in the heck she packed up all his clothes and mailed them to Ireland? That must have cost a fortune.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Much has been written about great work done by Jackson to bring Tolkien's masterpiece to cinemas. Howard Shore participated in the job and created a music wonder withing the great movie. Like in the entire Jackson production every item was purpusefully designed so is the music. It is great to have it and be able to listen to it not being forced to see the movie because you can rarely find over 11 hours to sit in front of your TV. Contrary, you can listen to the music and use your imagination or simply recollect the scenes from the Middle Earth.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|Bought two for my oldest kids and they love it.  It takes great movies and can do so much......glad I went digital.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love The Beatles, and their music is flawless. We all know their story in the camera eye, but what resides in the songs they wrote and sang? Perhaps this film explains it beautifully, and not only do the actors perform it, they live it! I went to see this film on its last week of screening because I wanted to know what it held in store, and fortunately, it exceeded way beyond my expectations. As of now, this is my favorite film of all time, and that's saying a lot. My sister also enjoyed it to call it her favorite as well. Thus, the important message in life is always \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and it is something that will wake us up and bring tears to our eyes because that is a world we need.
B00005JPLW|4.0|\\"If you cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least warriors... Careless, mocking, forceful - so does wisdom wish us: she is a woman, and never loves any one but a warrior. - `Thus Spake Zarathustra' by Frederick Nietzsche.     You are invited to carefully peruse and gaze into the Coliseum of the imaginative mind, consider the lush and graphic gladiatorial battle between good and evil. Ancient warriors laugh into the face of death, amidst the oldest creation myths concerned with the eternal  dualistic struggle between light and dark. Even today these opposing energies infuse our daily lives and charge us with the necessity of choosing one or the other; from the simplest to the most immense. Do we stick with the lo-fat/cholesterol, free range, organic diet to remain slim, or blow everything away and eat the incredibly decadent triple chocolate extravaganza, and become enslaved, shackled and obedient to the infernal God of gluttony? Republican or Democrat? Capitalism or Communism? Bible or Quran? Death penalty or Liberal re-education and integration? Levi's or Wrangler's? And the list goes on and on, from the mundane to the exotic and extremely eccentric. At Thermoplye in 480 BCE the fight was between a localized democratic austerity and a world dominating religious mysticism, the Spartan king Leonidas attempted to halt the Persian invasion of Greece under Xerxes the man-god.     Some individuals have seen 300 as a cleverly disguised political commentary on the current situation in the Middle East and Iraq, but this depends on whether you view President Bush as a decadent religious divine or a self appointed, idealistic warrior of morality. I didn't see such interpretations in this movie. For me, Bush rarely even displays grammatical correctness never mind the greater intellectual prowess necessary for successful international dialog; at any level, be it militarily, economically or diplomatically. 300 doesn't play devious or subtle mind games, it laysthe facts bare and presents us with a main dynamic; the evaluation of human emotion and motive, although there are some undertones of nationalism and religion. This clash is depicted in comic book fashion, an almost surreal and fantastic parody of humanity, the distinctions are sharpened to resemble a `chiascuro-esque painting by Carravagio which is viewed with absolute horror, intrigue and beautiful sadness. The passionate totality of birth, life and death are here, but yet still one asks `What is the point?' to which a Spartan warrior might reply; `The point is that which is at the end of my spear!'    It is like one USMC recruitment video intricately woven into yet another, only different costumes in another part of human history. There are only two main female characters in the movie, first the lush and exotic oracle girl, and the queen and wife of Leonidas and who unfortunately is placed in the position of bargaining for her husband's life with her sexuality. But here again the emotional and domestic rivalries and disputes reflect those on a national and international level. Only Spartan women give birth to real men, is the sum total experience of her femininity within this society; a concept that is as difficult for us to understand today as it is to comprehend the traditional Islamic way of life. This is a movie by men for men and many of the scenes linger on the rich musky sweat of bold masculinity.    300 is incredibly sharp, I struggled to breath in the last sequence with king Leonidas standing against a mighty army of thousands with his little band of men. Their choice was to deal completely with that precise moment in time, not to avoid or consider the consequences of their actions but remain true to themselves; to accept total responsibility. If such a movie contains a lesson it is this, temper your imagination and increase your resolve in all situations, concentrate with all attention on that which you are facing... allow no distractions and proceed without fear.
B000YXMMAE|2.0|I love the late Radiohead.  For me, \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Hail to the Thief\\" are beyond 5 star albums.  They are extremely strong, and I turn to them again and again for their mood, lyrics, and energy.  \\"Rainbows\\" by contrast is far from memorable.  I try to listen to it, but after the first couple of listens, it actually got worse.  Lacks imagination and energy.  I'd take the monotonous spaces of Amnesiac over the thinness of this effort.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|this one was just another good addition to the resident evil series. these movies are explosive, all of them. my kind of movies. nothing beats the first one, no doubt, but they just keep getting better and better. i was not disappointed, and i honestly didn't expect to be. everything was good, the acting, the story, and all of the undead. the action was tops, and alice is sweet kicking all kinds of azz all over the place. man, milla jovovich was born for this role. can't nobody do it like her for real. she gots that hard core in your face appeal that you can't forget. the rest of her crew goes a long way as well. okay, if you don't know what it's about it's a continuation of the virus. it spread all over the world now, and there doesn't seem to be any stopping it. alice, as always is the key, and she's on the run. with only few survivors, who must fight and keep on the move to stay alive. while all the while the umbrella corporation needs alice to see if there is a way to reverse the infection. the battle continues, and there are to many undead and undead birds as well. nice part. new fighters are introduced, old friends reunite, and above all love is finally revealed. an action ride, with a little blood, some intense moments, and casualties that you just wish wouldn't have happened. blend it all together and you got an emotional flick on all these different levels. everybodies fighting one way or another. some of the scenes on here are pretty sweet. her main squeeze and action man, oded fehr, is once again dazzling. very nice. he does action like second nature. great actor. ali larter she kicked it here too. she gets down. ashanti, brief but good, and let's not forget mike epps. always nice to see a funny face. and milla jovovich was in her own world. all in all, i could see it over and over again.
B000VWYJ8G|1.0|I preordered this video and gave it as a gift for Christmas. Unfortunately the movie is defective.
B0010HOZS0|5.0|First off, I'll let everyone here know that when i saw this movie I've never seen [[ASIN:0782009980 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]](shame on me) and so cannot compare it to that movie. I've never seen a re-make of it before, nor have I read the book. I went into this movie with (mostly) an open mind expecting some virus fun, and that exactly what I got.<br /><br />Walking out of the theaters on opening night, I remember my sister calling Invasion a \\"glorified zombie movie\\" and I could not agree more. No, this is not a \\"Zombie\\" movie in any strict sense of the word. The infected talk, drive cars, never show emotion, and remember their past lives. They do not try to eat their victims, and cannot tell right away who is and who isn't infected. That said however, there is just something about the way they move, the way they don't require nourishment, and just walk around mindlessly infecting others with their alien virus that makes them very zombie like. They're not [[ASIN:B0002IQNAG Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)]] zombies, and they're not [[ASIN:B000TJBN80 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)]] zombies either; these binges are a completely new sort of zombie, sort of the Stephen King zombie for those of you who've read [[ASIN:1416524517 Cell: A Novel]].<br /><br />Anyway, to the movie. It starts out pretty awkwardly to be honest. The shuttle crashes and from the very beginning we can tell that something is wrong, other than the guy turning into goo in his bed. we start to notice, very slowly, that some people are just... not acting like people. Their smiling too much, their too nice, they start throwing up in your coffee, you know, friendly stuff like that. at first everyone thinks there's some sort of flue going around but pretty soon we start to realize that something terrible, or maybe not so terrible, is going on.<br /><br />The real horror is that some alien virus has infected most of the world's population without us even being aware of it. this virus, with is passed from one person to another though bodily fluids much like in 28 Weeks Later, changes a humans personality so that they become very mellow, emotionless, and their only drive is to infect others and kill the immune. As the virus spreads, instead of worldwide chaos and anarchy that we see in most virus movies, wars and violence seem to stop everywhere it goes. US troops pull out of Iraq, Israel and Palestine end years of fighting, and President Bush meets with Chavez from Venezuela. Almost all the world's problems end overnight as this virus takes a hold.<br /><br />And that's the terror and dilemma of Invasion. Is this virus something that should be stopped at all cost, or is it a god given cure for our aggressive tendencies? Is it the cure for violence, war, and poverty? Should we fight this change in our human nature, or should we accept it? That question is always in the back of your head while watching this film, but at the same time once you look at the infected, you know you don't want to be one of them. Even though you know that the world would be a much safer place if we were all like them, you still know that it is better to be violent and human than peaceful and infected.<br /><br />The only real problem I had was that the ending was a little too convenient and abrupt. I mean, I liked the concept that they were going for, but they needed to milk the ending more than they did. The movie was going on all cylinders and then, with little warning, it ends. Despite this though, I found the movie very enjoyable. I walked out of that theater praising Invasion as much as I could, and you should too.<br /><br />EDIT: Okay, I've finally gone back and seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie as well as its 1978 remake. As much as I loved this version of the classic tale, I have to admit both those versions are much better then this and can understand why some older fans would give this one a negative review. This Invasion is no where near as goodas the older versions, but that doesn't make it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.<br /><br />Re-watch value; high.ake it bad. It's still a very good film, if one can somehow put the original movies out of mind while watching it.     Re-watch value; high.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|Like most people I heard the single \\"Love Song\\" and was instantly intrigued. Based on that one single I took a chance and bought the album and what a pleasant surprise. It's good. I mean, quite superb. Great songs and great singing style. I like that she's soulful without trying to mimic another artist, y'know what I mean? She just sings the songs with her own soul and it shows. \\"Little Voice\\" is a wonderful album and \\"Love Song\\" is just the tip of this iceberg. Enjoy!

0345404475|3.0|Knowing the movie so well, it was interesting reading this book and drawing the parallels.  I've also read the original script of the movie which is a novel itself and worth reading since it slightly differs from the movie and gives more explanation for things (i.e. why German is spoken throughout).    The book reads like a good romantic detective thriller, which was the original intent of the movie.  It just happened to be in the future.  Some imagery dates itself such as references to CRT monitors and some imagery gives the future too much credit for advancement such as references to the development of androids in the '70s.  But the concept is sound.  If one could just remember this was written in the mid-20th century, it could just be seen as a parallel universe if things had played out differently.  A future that could have been.  Post-apocolyptic novels were less common in this time and thus I feel more interesting to read.    The book, like the movie, brings up the value of life whether it is real or artificially created.  This arguement is displayed through the romantic relationships between Deckhard, and android and with his own wife.  There are many other examples of this through out the book.  Any avid reader should read this book as an example of groundbreaking thinking of the time and just to ask themselves the question  \\"What if..\\"

I love most kinds of music, and I am an Emmylou fan from way back, but I have to say I was so impressed with this CD, I played it for 3 months solid.  If you like Dire Straits, folk, country, rock, you will love this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini series should be mandantory viewing for all Americans.  It accurately depicts some of the sacrifices made for our freedoms.  Today's younger generation would be even greater by having the experience of viewing this series.  It is mine and my grown children's favorite movie.  Although not suitible for young children.  There is a short sex scene that did not need to be included and there are some depictions of war injuries.  Anyone that knows I own it has borrowed it and raved about it.  They have bought their own and I have given copies as gifts.  Enjoy!

B000VR824S|4.0|Fret-grinders everywhere are in hog heaven over this edition of Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival.  I play guitar and EC is one of my heroes, and his playing on this video is very inspired, and believe so for two reasons: the presence of Derek Trucks, possibly the best electric slide man alive, and Steve Winwood.    Some of the ensemble rhythm sections that play behind the artists are beefy and sizeable (two drummers and percussionists), yet the music doesn't suffer (it's not easy to get a group of 7-10 players to play in unison, no matter how great they are, but these are obviously well-cast players who listen and are quick studies).    The highlights on the disks for me were Sony Landreth's smoking instrumental, \\"Uberesso\\", \\"Anyday\\" (an old Derek and the Dominos tune) by Susan Tedeschi and Trucks' Band, John Mayer's \\"Gravity\\", Los Lobos' \\"Mas Y Mas\\" and Clapton's visitations of his classics, like, \\" Tell the Truth\\", \\"Presence of the Lord\\" and the songs with Steve Winwood, who is in fine voice and form. It was nice to see Jerry Douglas playing slide on a Telecaster during the Willie Nelson songs, which is a rare sight. If there is one track that absolutely floored me, it was the blues tune Clapton fronts, entitled, \\"Little Queen of Spades.\\"  Frankly, it's some of Clapton's best live playing in a long time.    Jeff Beck: would loved to have seen his performance of \\"A Day in the Life\\", which is astonishing.  His lady bassist is quite capable, but he seems a bit too deferential towards her.  Great to see Johnny Winter playing his old Gibson Firebird, but would have preferred seeing him play \\"Highway 61\\" at his breakneck pace a la mid-70s. The ensemble jams, as they have been with both Crossroads editions, have been the weakest or mediocre at best, but nice to see if only for historical purposes.    Wishes for future editions: extras, like interviews with all the artists talking about guitar! If they were still alive, SRV and Jimi would be there, and would be interested hearing perspectives on them from the players.  Who else should play in future: more Nashville pickers like Brent Mason! Robben Ford and Larry Carlton, Bill Nelson from Be Bop Deluxe, jazz/fusion man Steve Khan, Chuck Berry, and Ricky Skaggs, to name a few.  More women players, like Bonnie Raitt.  How about some whackos, like Junior Brown, just to keep things a bit off kilter? However, Clapton has made it known that any guitarist that is an A****le as a person would never be invited to play at this event. I support that notion!  Rock on, Eric and Company!
0375842381|5.0|What could say in such a short space about a work so complex, rich and beautifully crafted?  On the surface, the story is superb and fast-moving, the characters are enthralling and solid, and Mr. Pullman's imagination cobbles together elements that have never before been juxtaposed -- magic, physics, religion, animalism, society.  I know that these books have layer upon layer of allegory -- how to start to tease them apart I do not know -- but I cannot wait to read them again, to try to get at that kernel that is contained in such an intricate work!  If I could give this work 6 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.
1594489505|3.0|TSS is honest writing but lacks elements of story-telling necessary to meet the objective of a story of this kind: to make the reader feel like he or she has lived another life. But it's not unlike most modern literature, so one knows what to expect: nothing new. I strongly recommend Wolf's Revolution in place of this [[ASIN:0615147720 Revolution]]. It's language is refreshing and loved. The story is exceptional.
B000OLGCI4|3.0|I don't have kids yet! Someday, but they're always be must haves for the kiddies. Of course, by that point, they're probably be newer, better editions out!<br /><br />I didn't really remember much about this movie, apart from the songs. But as soon as it started, it all came flooding back. It was never my favourite Disney movie, and it was also Walt Disney's last movie, before he died. There are also a few problems with this movie - a couple of scenes are directly lifted from previous films (the scene where Mowgli is met by his 'family' is the same as the scene from Sword In The Stone), Phil Harris who did the voice of Baloo went on to voice the Little John character in Robin Hood, and the snake is the same in this film as in Robin Hood again. It feels almost lazy at some points, but they're using the same artists, so it does feel quite familiar at some points.<br /><br />Why was Jungle Book never my favourite Disney movie? I'm not quite sure about that one, it just never appealed to me as much as some of the others. I never really enjoyed the book either.<br /><br />I got the UK edition of the DVD, which comes with the 2 disc DVD, and also a book. It's just a plain picture book, with key scenes from the movie, which is quite a cute addition.<br /><br />Disney are doing well with these reissues of old movies, even if the extras are always aimed at the kids - what about adults reliving their childhood? - but they're not coming out fast enough! I missed out on Beauty & The Beast and Aladdin first time round, can't wait to hear about those!
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Whether you agree with him or not filmmaker Michael Moore's Sicko gives its viewers lots to think about concerning the state of healthcare in the United States today. Moore makes the argumentthat we would all be better off with a system of socialized medicine in place.<br /><br />It is clear that there are problems with the private insurance system which maximizes its profits by denying coverage to the sick in this country. Working from this premise Moore contrasts the systems in place in Canada, France, England and Cuba to show that universal coverage is the answer.<br /><br />Moore has taken a lot of heat over his investigative methods and his ways of presenting information. The question as to whether this is true journalism or pure muckraking and Bush bashing is best left up to the individual viewer but hos film is a good source of material for the health care debate and on this point alone it is well worth watching.

I wanted to have it for the holiday season and quit listening to songs off of youtube.  It's a must have for any time of year.  Buy it and enjoy!

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Perhaps this album is not the monumental statement that was OK Computer, but it is a collection of songs that definitely rewards repeated listens.  The songs seem simply constructed, but there is a complexity that unravels over time.    The sound effects and lush soundscapes are still there, but they are not the focus.  Instead they provide the background for a band that seems more willing to get a little personal with the listener.  \\"You're All I Need\\" features Thom admiring a woman, even though from a distance.  \\"House Of Cards\\"  is about an affair with a married woman.  Quite a switch from the paranoid voice we are used to.  You can hear a little of the anger we know Thom can generate in track 2, \\"Bodysnatchers\\", which also features a pulsing beat with grinding guitar chords.  There are a lot of hard rock bands that are glad Radiohead doesnt do more songs like this, because this is a song that really exposes how weak many rock bands are.    Some have commented that the track, \\"Reckoner\\", is a bit on the dull side, but I happen to really admire this one.  It has a lamenting melody that really seems to stick in my head.  I havent really had a chance to really take apart the lyrics to this song yet, so Im not really sure what I am supposed to take from it.  It sounds like in the chorus (if you can call it a chorus) he is singing \\"Dedicated to all human beings, because we seperate, like ripples on a blank shore.\\" So perhaps this is a lament on our chosen loneliness.  Im not postive, but I love the song.    The final track \\"Videotape\\" is well known by fans and sounds like it could have been on Thom's solo effort.  It has quirky percussion effects over a piano and is a haunting close to a fine album.  The lyrics seem to question what exactly our lives are going to be remembered for.  Classic weird, but ingenious, Radiohead.
0061547832|5.0|General George S. Patton, Jr. was one of our greatest WWII generals, and I couldn't help but think of one of his basic principles when reading this book: Grab `em by the nose and kick `em in the pants.  That is exactly what Donald Trump and Bill Zanker did with Think Big.<br /><br />I have also enjoyed all of Trump's books, and Think Big is one I thoroughly enjoyed.  They are all motivating, and this one especially.  It grabs you by the nose and kicks you in the pants with motivating stories and lessons.  It is direct, easy to read, and contains many useful tidbits of advice.  IF a person ACTS on the advice given by Trump and Zanker, they no doubt would benefit and achieve increased success.<br /><br />I personally have followed similar strategies such as presented in this book, and they have helped me obtain a level of success.  I plan on taking the advice from Think Big to jump start my year and make 2008 great.  I believe each of us should strive to do better each and every passing year.  So do Trump and Zanker, so read this book and start thinking bigger and achieving more in business and life than you have ever done before.<br /><br /> The chapters and lessons presented start with Trump illustrating the key points with examples from his life and dealings, and then end with a segment by Zanker where he shares some of his story and how he took The Learning Annex to the multimillion dollar company it is today.  While I enjoyed Trumps section a bit more, I thought Zanker was right on the money with many of the points he made as well, and his story is quite motivating in itself.  I think the combination of both men's examples made the book much better than if it only contained stories from one of them.<br /><br />Chapters include:<br /><br />1. Do You Have What It Takes?: where the reader can take a short quiz that is obvious and illustrates success principles.  (I'll give you a hint - if you are not answering d for every quiz answer, start thinking bigger and kick it up a notch).<br /><br />2.  Passion, Passion, Passion!:  Trump is always talking about being passionate about what you are doing.  This chapter will motivate you to find your passion and love what you do.<br /><br />3. Basic Instincts: Great lesson on keeping your word, and learn to go with your gut.<br /><br />4.  Creating Luck: Trump believes in luck, but he also believes that the harder you work the luckier you will get.<br /><br />5. Fear Factor: The world is brutal.  Practical advice on not only surviving, but excelling.<br /><br />6. Revenge: Trump is extremely loyal to those he is friends with, but you don't want to cross him.  Some of his advice is when somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.  This message is a good combination of when to forgive and when to go for the jugular with those that deserve it.<br /><br />7. Big Mo: how to build momentum and keep it up.<br /><br />8. Never Take Your Eye Off The Ball: You must learn to focus and success won't be easy.  Take your work seriously and stay flexibly focused and you'll succeed.<br /><br />9. I Love You, Sign This:  This is chapter on prenuptial agreements, which Trump endorses 100%.  I was recently listening to Brian Tracy and he was discussing prenups in just the opposite vein.  As an attorney, I have drafted prenups for clients, however, I don't agree with Trump that they should be drafted for every marriage.  Situations dictate and I personally think this was the weakest chapter of the book.<br /><br />10. Think Big And Kick A.. In Business And Life: A chapter on what else -Thinking Big!  Great ending chapter to motivate you to do even more than you are doing.<br /><br /> After those chapters is an Appendix that includes an interesting section of questions and answers by Donald Trump from Learning Annex Wealth Expos.  There is also a suggested reading list.  I've read many of the books on the list, but found a few that I want to read in the near future.  There are also a bunch of testimonials that I could have done without, and some promotional things for The Learning Annex.<br /><br /> Overall I really enjoyed this quick read.  It was motivational and just the thing to kick start 2008.  I thank my wife and daughter for putting it under the Christmas tree for me.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.quick read.

B000127LW2|3.0|First, like several other reviews, I am docking this set a star because of the price.  I own a great number of television series on DVD.  This is not one of them.  Nor do I own any of the other Star Trek franchises.  I've never even considered buying them.  While virtually every other show that has ever appeared on DVD is available at a reasonable price (though there are other exceptions, in particular classic BBC series like Monty Python and The Prisoner), the Star Trek series are only available at exorbitant and prohibitive prices.  My only guess is that they assume (and perhaps correctly?) that there are enough Trekkies out there who will allow themselves to be willingly robbed of their hard earned money.  But none of these sets should be priced on Amazon above $40.  There is, for instance, almost no expenses to be paid for rights to music, one of the reasons for the high cost of other sets (and why ALLY MCBEAL still isn't available, since most of its music can't be substituted for less expensive songs).  These should be cheap!  Instead they are just about the most expensive DVDs out there.<br /><br />Although the Star Trek series were set far in the future, narratively each series in the franchise was actually quite conservative and devoid of innovation.  I suspect they made the deliberate decision to be conservative so as to make the futuristic setting less opaque.  But even though the eighties saw tremendous advances and innovation in narrative, moving more and more from an episodic, stand alone format to a serial, ongoing story arc format, Star Trek in general hewed to the stand-alone format.  So despite the great casts and despite the often-brilliant writing, there simply isn't much in the way of overall narrative.  There is also as a result relatively little in the way of character development.  While I enjoy THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE 9, and VOYAGER, I always wonder how things would have turned out if the producers had decided to follow the example of shows like HILL STREET BLUES, CHINA BEACH, L.A. LAW, and ST. ELSEWHERE (all shows that predated these three Star Trek vehicles) and attempted a serial rather than episode format.  I think we might have seen something rather magnificent.  Instead, we would have to wait for BABYLON 5, FARSCAPE, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (created by Star Trek alum Ron Moore) to see just what could be done with serial narrative in a SF context.<br /><br />The tragedy with VOYAGER is that few series in the history of TV would have seemed to need a serial format more.  The parallel would be with the original 1978 version of BSG, which also seemed to require a serial format but also didn't get it.  Instead of the series being about their attempt to get home from the other side of creation, the need to get home merely provided the backdrop.  It should have been a narrative feature to drive the entire series forward.  Instead, it was just there.  Anyone viewing either FARSCAPE or the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can't help but notice how much better both of those series are in large part because they each honored that central idea of trying to go home.<br /><br />I also have a couple of very personal bones to pick with VOYAGER as I do with all of the Star Trek series.  I absolutely detest shows with aliens.  I hate shows that use science as a form of magic.  I simply find ornate, speculative scientific solutions to problems to be narratively unexciting.  They almost always remove us from the characters and, well, bore me.  Finally, I hate innovations like \\"shields.\\"  To me personally there is no more loathsome sentence in any SF series than something along the lines of, \\"Shields down to 60%!\\"  As much as I love FARSCAPE, I detested the day when Moya got her own energy shield.  And although I'm not a huge fan of BABYLON 5, I love that they never stooped to using shields.  And BATTLESTAR GALACTICA demonstrates how much more exciting a SF series can be when a spaceship just has to eat a big bomb.And don't get me started on phasers and lasers and photon torpedoes!<br /><br />Despite all this, VOYAGER is frequently a very interesting series.  Like most of the Star Trek series, the show has a great cast.  I really like Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway.  Interestingly, she was the second Star Trek captain to take her role after the French Canadian originally intended for the part declined to participate.  The first was Patrick Stewart, who because Picard after Louis Jourdan did not.  In this case, Mulgrew took over for Genevieve Bujold, who quit at the very beginning of the production.  I like the presence and command that Mulgrew brings to the show.  Plus, she has really great hair.  I like Tim Russ as Tuvok.  And most of the rest of the cast is also first rate, but for me personally the best character on the show -- and the only one that really brings anything new to the table -- is Robert Picardo's The Doctor.  On TNG Data had become TV's first truly great android character, providing many wonderful reflections on what it means to be a person.  But Voyager's Emergency Holographic Doctor did not even possess in any conventional sense a body.  Although I almost universally hate aliens on SF shows, I harbor a great love for any kind of so-called artificial life forms, whether we style them as robots, androids, or cyborgs.  (Any short list of my favorite SF characters would include Data, The Doctor, Seven of Nine, Max Guevera, River Tam, Kyle, and Sharon Agathon.)  VOYAGER would later introduce an equally compelling character along these lines in the marvelous Seven of Nine, someone who biologically is human but whose mind is still that of a hive.<br /><br />All in all I enjoy VOYAGER, though it is the source of much frustration for me.  Aliens, shields, stand alone episodes.  All of this impedes the enjoyment for me.  Still, despite this I find much to like.  But I would strongly recommend anyone wanting to see this to rent it from Netflix.  It isn't merely criminal for Paramount to offer these discs at such immoral prices; anyone buying the discs at these outrageous prices are colluding with them.ed on phasers and lasers and photon torpedoes!

6304712936|5.0|`Amadeus' was one of the most refreshing spectacles I have had the pleasure of witnessing in quite some time.  I was personally blown away with what I was presented with and have thus concluded `Amadeus' to be one of the best motion pictures in the history of motion pictures.  If you have not had the privilege of witnessing this powerful film then please, stop everything you are doing and track this movie down, order it straight from this webpage if you need to, but please watch this movie immediately.  I don't think I've been this passionate about a single film since I saw `The Godfather' for the first time.  Truly all the praise and admiration that has been associated with this masterclass of a film is well warranted.  `Amadeus' is astounding from start to finish, a truly mesmerizing and utterly flawless production.  Milos Forman is God; seriously.<br /><br />As the film opens we meet Antonio Salieri, a man gone crazy.  He is living in an asylum and claims to have murdered Mozart.  In the opening scenes of the film Salieri is met by a priest who wants to hear his story and so Salieri proceeds to tell him how it was that he came to meet, grow to despise and eventually kill Mozart.<br /><br />Antonio Salieri was an aspiring composer who has reached a certain level of fame as court composer to Emperor Joseph II but he has achieved nothing in comparison to the fame and recognition as the esteemed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Salieri himself feels that Mozart's music is divine, something sent from God above (kind of the way I feel about this movie) but when he has the chance to finally meet this messenger of God he is let down.  Mozart is not the noble gentlemen he had expected but instead is a pompous arrogant vile thing that sends shivers down Salieri's spine.<br /><br />How could God use this disgusting man in such a beautiful and miraculous way?<br /><br />It becomes apparent that the Emperor is smitten with Mozart's talent though and this bothers Salieri, not to mention others close to the Emperor.  Salieri then decides that he is to make it his life goal to destroy Mozart, to strip him of his power and social standing and ruin him, yes, kill him.  He concocts a plan all his own to accomplish this and sets it all in motion, waiting for the time to be right to strike and make his dreams come true.<br /><br />`Amadeus', as I mentioned earlier, is perfect.  I seriously cannot find a single flaw.  The script is deliciously absorbing and never loses the interest of its audience.  The direction is nothing short of phenomenal and the acting across the board is superb.  The two leads are brilliant.  F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar for his performance, captures the very dire frustration and conflicting emotions that drives Salieri to madness and Tom Hulce (who should have won the Oscar in my humble opinion) dominates as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, completely fleshing out his talent as well as the demons that choked out the flame that was his life.  Elizabeth Berridge was sorely robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Mozart's doting wife Constanze is brilliantly crafted and expertly executed.<br /><br />The only word I can use to describe this film is ecstasy; pure, unbridled ecstasy.  Since seeing this film I've thought of nothing else and have a feeling that I will think of nothing else for quite a while still to come.  Please, I beg of you, experience this film for yourself.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />Consider me entertained.ion others close to the Emperor.

Events seem to lend creedence to his story-Ivy has  vivid nightmares and fits .She evn burns her hand on cold glass in a re-enactment of Audrey Rose's terror as she strives to escape the burning death car.Then things turn darker when he reveals that she and Audrey Rose share a common soul and Audrey Rose wishes her to die so she can prepare for a new birth.  Matters culminate in a trial for kidnapping as Hoover's defence attorney basis  his case on the  truth of reincarnation and a parade of witnesses for and against reincarnation take their place on the stand .The end will be uplifting or depressing ,depending on what stance you take on the issue of reincarnation   The movie is very well acted by all concerned and is a highly charged and emotional movie that willget debate started on the issues it raises .My big problem is with the script by Frank de Felitta -author of the source novel -which is overt propaganda for reinacrnation beliefs .This unbalanaces the movie  and lessens its impact  Robert Wise directs superbly and the movie is never less than engrossing .I just wish it were more even handed in its debate
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I think Fantasy movies are, as a general rule, pretty bad.  There are the exceptions (Lord of the Rings for one) that are pretty decent but still I can name more bad than good.  So I went into Stardust with low expectations and found myself pleasantly surprised.    The story follows Tristan on his quest to a magical kingdom to recover a star to prove his love to a girl back home.  Yvaine is that star.  In the process of trying to get her home they run afoul of Lamia, one of many witches that want to cut out and eat Yvaine's heart for everlasting life.  They also cross paths with the son's of the late king who are vying for the throne by killing each other off and recovering a stone that came to be in Yvaine's possession.  It is a cute story, very straight forward and you know right where it is going to lead.  The good guys win in the end and the bad guys pay for their badness.  There is a lot of comedy along the way (some I'm sure unintentional) and overall it is just a very lighthearted, easy to watch movie.  It is also a clean movie so you can watch it as a family without worry.  The casting is also very good, as are most of the special effects.    The movie does have its flaws.  I didn't care for the charachter that DeNiro plays in the film, but on subsequent viewings I found it best to just laugh at his over-the-top persona and let it go.  It isn't like it ruins the film for me, despite what some might say.    The movie is also extremely straight forward with no surprises and some lame dialog, but i think that is part of its charm.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and I think that is part of its success.

It a fast moving and powerful yarn which also has something to say about the darker side of the male psyche and is a blessed by some fine acting especially from Brynner who brings a cold ruthless quality to the role which makes the robot seem genuinely indestructible .Benjamin and Brolin are a tad bland but this is suitable for their roles .This is a splendid movie and heartily recommended to all
B0000019HU|5.0|This is one of those albums you need to listen to in one continuous sitting.  That being said, it is a fantastic journey.  Slow, melodic runs building into fuzzed out chaos and returning to tranquility, it is a formula now used by many many bands ranging from Tortoise to bands like ISIS and Pelican.<br /><br />Listen to this album a few times before judging it, at first it can be hard to take the almost nonsensical lyrics serious. It will all make sense in time, as will the utter genius of this album.  Essential for any music lover.

B000YXMMAE|4.0|Radiohead's newest release is a solid fresh sounding disc that blends rocking and dreamy tunes. I have no problem with the music, it's great, and it grows on you. A lot of tasty playing, signature intimate vocals from Thom, and the string arrangements are well done.      I do have a problem with the packaging. The disc comes in a cardboard foldout with two stickers included so you can \\"do it yourself\\" and make a normal CD, if you have a spare jewel case lying around. Once assembled, if you do it correctly, it looks cheap and crappy. The stickers for the back and the spine are too small. Also, if you screw it up, tbd records offers no replacement stickers, so your stuck with the cardboard foldout. It's good that bands like Radiohead are looking out for their fans and trying to save us some cash, but I would have gladly coughed up a couple extra bucks for a professional looking CD.

B000000H4A|3.0|while this is no abigail this is the begining of a amazing career. even king bad cds are good albums overall. this is not a story album but songs like dressed in white and halloween cannot be denied along with the rest of this. it only gets 3 stars because i hold kings stuff on a pedistal but like i said before even his worst album is a good album overall. plus on the remaster you get the amazing songs the lake and no presents for christmas. so get this and see what metal really is.
B000YENUI6|5.0|Eastern Promises was not at the theaters very long, but it will be remembered as a great film for years to come. Taut, captivating, and unflenchingly brutal in spots, this film is definitely one of the years best.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen (terrific here as he was in Cronenberg's other classic, A History of Violence) stars as a chauffeur to the son of the Russian Mafia Godfather in England. The son (played by Vincent Cassel) is an alcoholic incompetent who is a disgrace to his father (played by Armin Mueller-Stahl). Mortensen finds himself trying to be obedient to his boss while constantly having to help him get out of trouble.<br /><br />But Mortensen is stretched to the limit when a young woman dies in childbirth at a local hospital. The midwife attending her (played by Naomi Watts)goes through the woman's belongings and finds a diary she'd written in Russian. A card in the diary leads to the Russian Godfather's business. And things quickly become very complicated.<br /><br />Cronenberg, who became famous for making gross-out horror films like Scanners and The Fly, has become one of the great thriller directors of our era. And he has found a more than capable accomplice in Mortensen, who pulls off this role effortlessly. The film contains extremely graphic and brutal scenes, including a fight scene in a sauna that has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />The story is engrossing, the acting is terrific, and the end result is a film classic.
B000QFCD2W|5.0|Ok as with all king diamond cds i always find the stories uninteresting but thats how i find lyrics in general. i listen to the music and the voice no really the words. now the sonsg on here are he best bunch of songs since the house of god cd which i loved. and this cd has the best production since the just ok cd voodoo.and the playing from all members shines on this release.its abut time that the king get a grammy nod for his importance in the history of metal. if you love metal check out this cd.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|We got this for our 3 year-old son and it has helped with the bedtime battles. He is staying in bed watching his planets. We read the reviews before purchasing so were prepared for the noisy motor, and it really isn't loud enough to be distractive - both our kids have fallen asleep with it on. The main features I like are the glow of the sun - perfect for a night-light, the movement of the planets that entertain, and the 15 minute shut-off feature. My main gripe about the product is the battery power it takes. Three C batteries and those didn't even last a week! So this will be an expensive product to keep working. Overall I recommend this product.
B000RE1RR4|5.0|My title says it all.  This is a top-notch show with excellent writing and characters you want to know more about.  The southern accent gets a little old but it's pretty good.  The shows take unexpected twists and I really enjoy trying to figure out who did it and how/why they did it.
0060594896|5.0|This is not a \\"follow my approach and get rich\\" book. Rather it incorporates many useful principles - from psychological insights to specific business tactics - for personal and professional success. Canfield gets at the limiting beliefs we hold that prevent our growth and success in every sense of the word, whether you want to become a millionaire or lose 30 pounds. His advice will make you a better business person, a better parent, a better spouse, a better citizen, a better friend.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that success requires working on yourself. This book has been an outstanding tool for me. I came to it with a readiness for change. I have pushed up my sleeves and am taking countless steps to lead a better life and more closely follow my dreams.<br /><br />(Despite the name, I am not related to Jack Canfield...but wish that I had someone so motivational in my family!)
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Even my husband and 21 year old son enjoyed this movie. I loved the entire cast, but particularly enjoyed Russell Crowe in a different type of movie than what he usually does.  I thought he was charming and funny.  I hope he does more romantic comedy.  A funny and entirely entertaining movie to take you away from the dreary winter months to beautiful Provence!
B000056BOR|5.0|It's always a pleasure to watch and oldie that's a goodie. Cary Grant& Doris Day share fine screen sparks. Kick back, bring some pop corn, snuggle with the one you love, and be gloriously entertained by top entertainment~!
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|It is so refreshing to see a movie like Sky High, a movie that is pure fun to watch for the whole family. Solid performances by all the cast, a story that never slows down nor takes itself too seriously, good FX, it has everything you want if you want to have a good time and forget your troubles for a while. Highly enjoyable!
B00008J4P5|2.0|This album is good. If you like simple \\"three-chord-garage-bands\\" with good beat and good rhythm, then this album is PERFECT for you, it's as simple as that. DON'T READ THIS REVIEW ANY FURTHER.... BUT! if you want to buy this album and you do not fit the above description 100%, then read on. I am a huge huge fan of music, particularly rock. I own more than 200 cds and I live in a location where you can't find any cd anywhere on the entire country, only on internet, but it costs a month worth of recess money, so I have to make careful decisions on which album to buy. I took my chances and went with this one. Let me tell you why I think this only deserves 2.5 stars and not 5.  I love many many cds, but there are a few that are PERFECT & FLAWLESS, those are: Superunknown by Soundgarden, (What's The Story) Morning Glory by Oasis, Ten by Pearl Jam, Dirt by Alice In Chains, Audioslave by Audioslave and some others. Take these examples of what I think are flawless albums so you get an idea of what my taste is and based on my tastes..THAT'S the way I rated this album.  There are many simple \\"three-chord-bands\\" that have albums that are really really good and almost perfect, like Nirvana's IN UTERO and NEVERMIND, so there's no denying that I DO like these kinds of bands, just not 100%.    One of the first reasons in which I didn't give this album more than 2.5 stars is for starters the lack of variety and creativity from the band. I mean, of course there are great songs on this album, like SEVEN NATION ARMY, THE HARDEST BUTTON TO BUTTON and BALL & BISCUIT (being my favorite off the album), but there's still other notes, chords, themes, sounds, beats, style and lyrics to discover, so there is a BIG \\"not\\" in that area. I've also seen that some of the songs need a proper ending, like SEVEN NATION ARMY, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF and I WANT TO BE THE BOY THAT WARMS YOUR MOTHER'S HEART. The ending to those songs are really improper and weak, a good song needs an even better ending. Another \\"not\\" in the album is the sound, I know it's a garage sound, but the sound doesn't need to sound bad, with a good remaster from a good producer this album will definitely gain more stars, or at least one. Another downside is Jack's voice, his voice is really agrevating, at least for me, I really dislike it because it doesn't fit the potential of the songs. There are really good songs as there are really awful songs, like Hypnotize, Little Acorns, The Air Near My Fingers (which by the way it's a total rip off NIRVANA'S song Rape Me, shame on JACK WHITE) and In The Cold, Cold, Night being the worst. What I also hate is the over-recognition this band and album is getting, they are really overrated, both the band and the album, specially Jack White; I mean come on ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE, he can't possibly be the number 17th greatest guitarist ever, and put Van Halen on #70 !! Blasfemy. Anyway, another downside to this record is the duration or length, just 49:47 minutes long, of they have included more solos like the one from BALL & BISCUIT and more songs and greater riffs, the album wouldn't need to be too short and weak, I know better albums that are much shorter, but have more \\"mojo\\" and \\"spunk\\" than this one, like Franz Ferdinand's debut self-titled album, it lasts 38 minutes and has unbelievable riffs, bass-lines, vocals, lyrics and rhythm.  Anyway, another downside is the price. 14 bucks is too much for this or any White Stripes album, I don't know why we should pay more than 9.99 dollars for this album, there are 10x better albums cheaper, like Alice In Chains' Dirt at almost half the price of this one and The Clash's London Calling. You can get them at this same website. Amazon is the best place to buy these things.     Well there you got it, a couple of reasons why and why not to buy this record, if you have extra cash and want to buy an average interesting album that will not surprise you, but will keep you entertained for 50 minutes,buy this one. But if you are looking for a masterpiece, an album that will blow you away from your prime and at the end you'll feel obligated to applaud and listen to it again, then I suggest any other album mentioned above in this review, specially SUPERUNKNOWN by SOUNDGARDEN, maybe my all time favorite album, and also MORNING GLORY by OASIS.
0525950079|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read. I remembered Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", and was astonished to find out that \\"World without the End\\" is somehow a continuation of the first book (although both stories are separated by about 200 years). The \\"World without the End\\" has surpassed my expectations. It's a simple story of one small English town where the local politics and every-day life is mixed with church's greed and lack of innovation. It is also a story of lives of four main character's intertwined and enriched by excellent character development. When you immerse yourself in this book you can almost smell and taste the real middle ages England. The book deals richly with several aspects of live in 14th century England, and details the way people used to live, work, trade, use money and coins, and get medical help. Also, if you are a history buff, you have a chance to find out about the reign of Edward III and his mother Isabella (accused of assassinating his husband, King Edward II), and get a thrilling description of the battle of Crecy (part of 100 years war).     I never liked other Follett's books (political thrillers and mysteries) but I couldn't put this one down and despite 1000 pages, this story was never too long. I wish Mr. Follett wrote another historical masterpiece like this. This book is highly recommended.
B000YXMMAE|1.0|Radiohead was an amazing band from Pablo Honey to OK Computer. Then came the new millenium. Kid A... sucked, Hail To The Theif... sucked, pretty much everything they've done since KID A is lame ! They betrayed the first fans, I've been a huge fan of theirs since Pablo Honey in '93. Back then it was my favorite band because their second album just improved, their third surprisingly improved The Bends which I thought back then was waaay too difficult to follow. By OK Computer I idolized these guys, I knew their fourth album would be even better !! Guess what, KID A made me cry because they showed too much decline from their original post grunge, which would by THE BENDS become alt. rock, sound. I said \\"man, the fans will hate Radiohead after the stunt they did\\". In my opinion their new millenium sound is TERRIBLE AND DISGUSTING. I hate techno or electronic music, whatever you want to call it, it's the same bs that we hear at lame clubs and other mediocre non-rock artists. When I bought KID A I literally cried tears. Then threw the record away, 18 bucks I never ever saw again. Now, I've decided to give it a try once again. But they still suck after 8 years without me listening to them. So goodbye Radiohead forever. I'll stick to their early stuff and kiss 'em goodbye. You've lost a big big fan.
B000SEIDR0|4.0|I enjoyed the book for factual information on Corn, beef(feedlot)industry, big organic farming and pastoral farm of Joel Salatin. Professor Pollan has done a good deal of research on the subject to which he has added \\"on-the-job\\" experience. Pollan weaves the historical information with his narrative of visiting farmers, feedlots, and  farms. The book covers major foods and their production methods with one glaring omission - dairy industry. Writing flows nicely until he gets in to hunting - wild pigs and mushrooms. Here the writing becomes laborious, too personal and lacks the broad appeal of the earlier chapters.    I enjoyed his stay at Salatin's farm. But Pollan is being too generous on his farming methods. Salatin is already facing a difficult problem of disposing of discarded chicken parts for such a small operation. Imagine the problem if scaled up production, or if he did slaughter his own pigs and cows right on the farm.     The weakest part of the book is Chapter 17 on \\"Ethics of eating animals\\". It seems like a deliberate attempt, bordering on being dishonest, to completely ignore the 2000 year old history of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain thought on the subject and practices at being vegetarians.  Even now a large portion of Western and Southern India (probably in 100's of million people) have remained vegetarians for centuries. I wish Pollan visited India, stayed with some ordinary vegetarian families and reported first person account on how routine, but varied and flavorful the diet of these families are.  This is the only reason I took away one star.    Chapter 17 lacks in other aspects as well. For example, he skirts the issue of moral hypocrisies about avoiding - dogs, cats and horses, while still finding it perfectly normal in eating a cow, chicken or pig from a family farm even while you may have given pet names to these creatures, or as a child you grew up with these animals.    So in summary - an excellent researched book with the omission of dairy, Buddhist, Hindu and Jain thought,and scalability of pastoral farms.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you are into nature documentaries and have a decent rig (HDTV, Middle-of-the-Road DVD player, Surround sound system), then this series will amaze you! Brilliant insight into ecosystems that are rarely seen, much less recorded in high definition. There are also sporadic behind the scene sub-documentaries that expose how the photographers (adventurers) capture the videos that will leave your mind blown. Superb DVD set!!

0743486285|5.0|This book really gives you a great view inside the life of Nikki Sixx, the Crue, and what cocaine and heroin do to a normally sane, brilliant individual. All Nikki's relationships are brought up again and again as time goes on, to show the negative impact the drugs had over time.    Just a great read. I have never been so captivated by any single book my entire life.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|Awesome movie... I thought it would be the third and final one... Like the rest this one will be watching this one over and over again... Be sure of that....
0765316889|5.0|I was wondering how this book would be, since one of the major figures of the last book was gone...  But it was interesting seeing them all try to cope.  And the remaining characters did seem to step up to the plate a bit and try to fill the gap.<br /><br />The story itself was good, with the end satisfying, even though it's obviously a \\"middle book.\\"  The Lord Ruler's tyrannical thousand-year rule has ended, but of course that means chaos fills the power vacuum.  Lord Elend Venture, an idealistic, scholarly aristocrat who always championed the oppressed Skaa, tries to lead the Central Dominance as a king who establishes a council with power and rights.  But his ruthless father, Straff Venture, has gained kingship in the North and is now coming to Luthadel to conquer it.  And the minor king of the west has also brought an army to besiege Luthadel.  Trying times calls for decisive leadership, but Elend cannot compromise his belief in giving power to his people, even when he risks losing everything that was gained.<br /><br />Vin, with her Mistborn powers, renowned for killing the Lord Ruler, loves Elend.  She has to constantly thwart assassination attempts against him--and has to fight her own heart which tells her she isn't worthy of him.  She also battles her feelings for a mysterious Mistborn opponent who comes out of the night to challenge and intrigue her...<br /><br />I enjoyed these characters much more than I thought I would.  They were overshadowed by the very charismatic Kelsier in the first book, but they seem to be developing nicely in this installment.  I will certainly look forward to the next book in the series.
0807126063|5.0|is how I'd describe the reviewers here who have the audacity to rate A Confederacy of Dunces less than ten stars.  I pity those of you who don't find this book funny; you're obviously deficient in theology and geometry, with taste levels corrupted by the poor fare that passes for humor in this \\"Family Guy,\\" \\"Knocked-Up\\" culture. This is the funniest book ever written.  John Kennedy Toole killed himself, in part, because this great book was rejected by myopic publishers.  Thank God Walker Percy recognized genius, and thank you, Ignatius J.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Gilmour shines - a magnificent performance captured as well as any could be.  The sound is perfectly recorded, mixed and encoded in Dolby 5.1.  Guest performers Graham Nash and David Crosby do yeoman's work backing Gilmour - but the standout guest performance is a surpassing rendition of Comfortably Numb with David Bowie.      David's On an Island - a very personal project - is incorporated into the classic Floyd mix with care and it stands well with the early work.  Indeed, On an Island is contemporary \\"Floyd\\" and it is a work of art, too.    Few people have the luck and funds to attend a performance that is this visually stunning and musically perfect.  The show runs 227 minutes!  I cannot think of many other performers or performances that can retain your attention for nearly four hours!    This DVD is as close to the actual experience that most of us will ever have.  A real gem - shine on David Gilmour - you crazy diamond.

B000QYCXFU|4.0|This is a note to myself to remind me that I have read this book twice now. The first time must have been years ago. This week a friend offered a copy suggesting it was a good read and I should read it. Not remembering it by the title or author I took it home and started to read it and instantly remembered reading it before. Each page brought back the memory of how things went. It is a good read, and an interesting and informative story. Hopefully, this time I will remember having read it for a longer period than last.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Who says you need guns in a movie to make it exciting and successful? Certainly not Eastern Promises Director David Cronenberg. Not a pistol or shot fired in this movie.<br /><br />Cronenberg is on a roll. In 2005 Cronenberg did the awesome [[ASIN:B000CQLZ0Q A History of Violence]] (with Vigo Mortensen, and Mortensen is the leading man in Eastern Promises too), and A History of Violence was Cronenberg's best since Dead Ringers back in 1988. Strangely, Both A History of Violence and Eastern Promises were not big box office hits. But don't let that fool you. If you missed A History of Violence, don't miss Eastern Promises...then go rent the former.<br /><br />Eastern Promises is an episode in the life of a London chapter of the Russian mob and how an unsuspecting midwife at a local hospital gets mixed up with them. Now that may not sound too compelling, but let me tell you...you get a thoroughly entertaining film here complete with a hard R for brutal, bloody violence.<br /><br />The team of Cronenberg and Mortensen have done it again with Eastern Promises...another fast paced, engrossing film. The movie includes twists that you never see coming, and leaves an opening for Cronenberg to do something he's never done: direct a sequel to one of his films.<br /><br />Check it out.
B000XA5K48|1.0|I absolutely love action movies and I bought this one as soon as it hit the shelf. I understand that a certain level of acrobatic and death defiance is standard flare for this genre but after watching this film I had lost 90 minutes of my life that I can never regain. I want my money back, it's THAT bad. I will never watch this piece of garbage ever again.<br /><br />The acting was beyond flat, the scenes were so beyond impossible that I could only laugh at them and the dialogue was so lame it was painful to sit through. It actually got worse the longer the film ran.<br /><br />I blame the writer first and foremost for coming up with this steaming pile of film but after that there is an entire list of people to blame for producing this thing. The pitiful one liners are in every scene and the \\"You know what I hate...\\" stuff gets old after the third time let alone the twenty ninth. The writer is constantly pushing his attitudes on us regarding child raising, driving habits and gun control, none of which he seems mature enough to provide.<br /><br />This movie is portrayed at the level of intellegence of a teen ager yet the content is such that teens should not be allowed to watch due to the fact that it will permenently lower the viewer's IQ.<br /><br />If you like pathetic dialogue and mindless action without plot then this is the movie you have always waited for.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Back in 1954, Richard Matheson wrote a 'Legendary' novel that inspired many authors and film makers. Stephen King often gives partial credit to Matheson for his categorical success (see [[ASIN:0425104338 Stephen King's Danse Macabre]]). Three film adaptations have been made of this \\"Legendary\\" novel. None of the three have ever done the novel true justice. But the most recent adaptation of Matheson's novel called [[ASIN:0765357151 I Am Legend]] is perhaps the best movie of 2007.<br /><br />It's no secret that 2007's I Am Legend centers around the exploits of Will Smith playing the last man on Earth. And Smith is absolutely phenomenal as this modern day (2009 - 2012) survivor; he deserves an award for his portrayal as Dr. Robert Neville. The movie runs for 101 minutes and Smith occupies the screen pretty much solo for about 3-quarters of the movie...but rest assured...he's not alone.<br /><br />Fans of Matheson's novel should go into Director Francis Lawrence's 2007 film adaptation with an open mind. The key word is that this is an 'adaptation' inspired by the original novel. In fact, 2007's I Am Legend seems to not only be inspired by the novel, but also by the two prior film adaptations ([[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]] & [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]]; the 2007 film has elements of all three as well as some very cool original aspects.<br /><br />Lawrence does an excellent job at keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with taught suspense. Smith keeps you captivated from start to finish. The story is terrific. The action scenes are very well done. But the superhuman abilities of the 'night seekers' is a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I look forward to the DVD release of I Am Legend, because I will certainly add it to my cart.<br /><br />DVD RELEASE UPDATE - 3-20-2008 -- The DVD release of I Am Legend includes an alternate ending option to the theatrical release. Watch it. It is dubbed the \\"controversal ending\\", but it is actually more true to the theme of the original idea created by Matheson that the title of the story is derived from. Is Nevelle (Smith) a \\"Legend\\" for his work in science or is he a Legendary monster among the world's new society?created by Matheson that the title of the story is derived from.

0316067598|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a very good friend (Ex Ranger) who is a veteran of Operation Urgent Fury.  I have some knowledge of SF operations and I have on two occasions exercised with USN SEALS.  I was very disappointed with this book.  The writing style is terrible and the author really does not seem to personify the unassuming, quiet professional SF operator.  He seems to be the opposite.  At one point he talks of many years of training when in fact at the time of this operation he was a very junior operator with no real depth of knowledge.  I was appalled when he spoke of the team yelling out to each other and joking in loud voices.  No wonder they were comprimised, sound carries a long way in the mountains.  I applaud the amazing fighting spirit of his teamates who though all having been shot several times fought to the end.  I had some real questions about this version of events. I don,t think we will ever really know what happened up on that mountain, we only have Luttrels version which is very self serving.  My hat goes off to the men of the QRF who died trying to help the team and the 3 members who died.  They were brave men and they deserve their story to be told in a book worthy of their sacrifice.
0375842209|3.0|I bought this book because of the ratings and thought this book must be it. After reading it i can say that it is a ok story but the book was   waay too long. It bored me at times and i just pushed myself to finish it.300 Pages would have been totally enough.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This is a great show that I recently discovered.  The collection is worth it, and you will be able to watch this show numerous times.  I haven't even begun to watch the Special Features, but the episodes themselves are worth it.    I can't say ANYTHING bad about this show!
B00004U45G|5.0|This CD will knock you out of your seat!<br /><br />I don't know who had the great sense to record and market this fantastic live performance but they should be awarded both a Nobel and a Pulitzer. Just listen to the first track (\\"Celebration Day\\") and you'll have a sense of the entire brilliant work.<br /><br />Here we see combined a lot of cuts from both Led Zeppelin II and III, two of my three favorite classic rock albums of all time, by these masters of rock and, WOW, what a ride! There are also cuts from other great Led Zeppelin albums.<br /><br />The beauty of the songs found herein is that the band/singers stayed VERY close to the original sounds and guitar riff techniques. You'll swear that you're listening to Led Zeppelin in their early days when you hear the guttral, raw essence of these songs. I've been a guitar player for 40 years and this is some very fine work.<br /><br />I don't buy a lot of live performance albums, especially recent releases, but this one is a big exception to that rule. You can't listen to this one soon enough, folks!<br /><br />See my \\"listmania lists\\" for more great Classic Rock choices.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|There's no excuse to NOT get \\"In Rainbows\\", especially considering that the album is being sold for an astonishing $7.99 at the time of this writing and it's quite possibly one of the band's best albums, if not THE best. The album is a fantastic mix of ten songs packaged in a make-it-yourself cd kit (you're gonna need an empty jewel case to put it together and I'm pretty sure some of you have a cd or two that's worth stripping and tossing for it's jewel case) and that's part of the fun of this album, which from the beginning has been an odd event in musical history. Starting out as a download where fans could pay whatever they wanted to get their hands on it, the album finally arrives in it's \\"physical manifestation\\". I think what's so good about \\"In Rainbows\\" is that it manages to still be experimental yet more accessible than any of their albums since \\"Pablo Honey\\". Songs like \\"15 Step\\" and \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" grab you immediately in their immediacy while \\"House of Cards\\" (my fave track) and \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" allows you to just sit back and really pay attention to the intricacies of the track compositions.<br /><br />There's really not much more to say than that. I could go into an in depth breakdown of each track but in all honesty, this is an album that should be picked up by anyone who likes great music and doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. I recommend this without reservation to anyone and everyone, even those who only kind of like Radiohead. I promise you won't be disappointed.
B000002J1U|5.0|Yes, I think that there are, technically speaking, actually a FEW greater classic rock albums of the 20th Century, (e.g., Led Zeppelin II, Sgt. Pepper), but this one ties with Hendrix's \\"Electric Laydyland\\" for my personal all-time favorite album. I can play it over and over without burning out. The more I hear it, the more I like it.<br /><br />The songs are fairly short by Led Zeppelin standards and there are just a glut of brilliant rock music \\"ideas\\" on here, astonishingly innovative. The song \\"Tangerine\\" is an absolute killer and I think is probably definitive of the entire work. This is the true, raw Led Zeppelin that we savoured prior to too much studio polishing of subsequent albums.<br /><br />Folks, you won't get hurt on this one! Get it -- turn it UP!!!<br /><br />See my \\"listmania lists\\" for more great period classic rock choices.
0393327655|4.0|This was one of the first books I read on religious fundamentalism and I enjoyed it. A lot. This is a good starting point before tackling some of the harder stuff like Breaking the Spell or God is Not Great. Those books are aimed at an already secular audience, while End of Faith is a little bit friendlier. Still I don't like all the crazy meditation stuff at the end. Otherwise it is great.
B000GTJT16|1.0|First off let me state that I love Tim Burton films and Sleepy Hollow is no exception. I'm reviewing this particular release based on the HD DVD picture quality. I must say that I'm in the same ballpark as the other reviewers when I say that I thought this was the worst picture on any High Definition disc that I have seen to date. The picture was absolutely crawling in certain scenes and I found this incredibly distracting. It was the first HD DVD that I couldn't even finish watching. I would rather see the Standard DVD before I would attempt to watch the HD DVD version again.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm probably going to get torn to pieces over slighting the quality of this release due to people being gun shy over the \\"format war\\". However I am sick of hearing \\"Thats how the director intended it!\\". I know that Tim Burton had no idea this movie would ever get released in High Definition when he filmed it. I am 100% sure they can do better than this and I expect a better version to be release on High Definition Media sometime in the far future. I myself will take my chances and wait for that one.<br /><br />I'm glad I rented it first. I hate to give it 1 star because I do love this movie, but I also feel that most of you already have an opinion of the film and aren't here to read what mine is. Thats why this is just the HD DVD version of Sleepy Hollow review.<br /><br />(I think that if you'll take time to see my other reviews you'll know that I'm not here to slam HD DVD...just this release)
0694003611|5.0|My Daughter and I read this book nightly. We say Goodnight to the \\"Great green room\\" in the same rhythmic way every night. The familiarity of the book creates a ritual for us, we know as soon as we say goodnight to the \\"noises everywhere\\" next she gets bedtime kisses and then she snuggles into bed. As your child grows they can learn the names of other items in the room and create correlations, they can explore the solid colors and concepts (i.e. my daughter learned to point out Fire and say hot, and she recognized the window although not directly named) this helps to build their critical thinking skills. The book is like a tranquilizer for her little brain. We read a lot as a family through out the day, but we always read this last before bed.
B000000OUJ|5.0|I'm gonna do a track-by-track analysis of Liquid Swords.  That's the only way I could to this album justice.  This is easily stacks up in the top 3 albums I own, and that' s saying A LOT as I own tons of albums... the only track I didn't like on this was hell's windstaff, which is ironically enough the only skit on this album...      Liquid Swords - 4.75/5    This is an outstanding track and does justice to the \\"title track\\" title.  I'd have given it a 5/5 were it not for the obnoxiously long 1:33 minute intro.  It's an interesting intro to the album, but couldn't that have been a completely separate intro track to begin with?  Aside from that though, it's a flawless track.  Great hook, great beat, poetic lyrics as deep as the ocean... everything.      Duel of the Iron Mic - 4.5/5      Were it not for Mastah Killah's merely okay verse, this would be my favorite track off the album.  Why did he get a verse over Raekwon, Method Man or ODB?  Hell, GZA could've done a lot more with the extra space... still, though, there was one big, big reason why this was still a great guest track:  Inspectah Deck killed it with a mere 7 bars.  So good, in fact, that I need to post them.      \\"Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust  Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush  Out of town foes look shook but still pose  We move lioke real pros through the streets we stroll  Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six oh  So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold  Bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers  Bitches caught in airports, keys in they *******  No peace, yo the police mad corrupt  You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut  Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless  Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest  individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded  Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin\\"    The best guest appearance and some of the best lyrics on the album next to Method Man's appearance on Shadowboxin &Ghostface and RZA on 4th Chamber.  Not surprising, though; this is Rebel \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\" INS we're talking about.     Besides that, though, the beat was one of the best on the album; bangin.  GZA's lucky he was in the same boat as RZA.  Another interesting fact is that ODB did the hook.      Livin In the World Today - 4.25/5      It's a good song, but a good song is an average on on LS.  Probably my least favorite song on the album.  The lyrics are fire as usual, but the beat & hook were average in contrast to the rest of the album.      Swordsmen - 4.75/5      Dope song.  Hook's good, beat's a banger and the lyrics are fresh from hell.  I don't know if its just me, but GZA's delivery seemed to be especially on-point on this song.      Cold World - 5/5      Yeah, yeah, this is the joint \\"everyone likes\\".  Who gives a damn?  There's a reason why everyone likes it... it's one of GZA's best tracks, period.  It really showcases his storytelling ability; it's almost like he decided to make a track to try to beat Kool G Rap at their own game like Nas did with NY State of Mind.  In fact, that's the best track I can think of comparing this one to; detailed to the goddamned brim yet completely understandable; no comprehension is lost through the mix.    The beat is the best on the album (bar B.I.B.L.E, but that's not actually a track on this album).  It's beautiful, harrowing, and really does succeed at conveying a \\"cold world\\".  RZA really shows his merits as a producer on this one.      Labels - 5/5      Did GZA really just make a song about... record labels?!  He sure did, and the whole joint is crazy.  He namedrops almost every single record company under the sun, including Cold Chillin, the label that pretty much shafted GZA & RZA when they first started.  Thus the line \\"Cause I smother you COLD CHILLIN' mother*******\\".  The beat is dope too.  All in all, it's the best track on the album, perhaps only equaled and/or surpassed by Cold World, 4th Chamber & Liquid Swords.4th Chamber - 5/5      This is my favorite track off the album besides Cold World, LS & Labels.  It's another collab track, but this time not a single one of the spots is wasted.  Ghostface & RZA especially rip the track to shreds.  To quote two of their bars (one from each):    \\"Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with rac-coons  Corner sittin wine n***** sippin Apple Boone, this ain't no white cartoon\\"    -Ghostface    \\"Rollin with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen  Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions\\"    -RZA    For those of you who didn't catch that last line from RZA, he basically said PEACE.    GZA's verse was great too.  Killah Priest was the weakest one on the track, but he was still dope; THAT should tell you the pedigree of the verses on this one.  This is the best verse on the album second only to Cold World.        Shadowboxin' - 4.75/5    2nd best collab track on the album (4th Chamber takes that) and another outstanding track on the album.  Method Man really brought that hot **** to this track... beat's yet another banger.  GZA impresses as usual.         Hell's Windstaff/Killah Hills 10304 - 3.5/5      The only track off this album I didn't think was good.  The lyrics themselves are good, but I hate the beat & the whole intro.  I can't explain why, but I just did... useless track in my opinion.  Filler.      Investigative Reports - 4.5/5      Dope track.  Good hook, great lyrics, great beat.  Not my favorite, but an excellent track nonetheless.      Gold - 5/5      This is easily one of my favorites off the album.  While it isn't on the same tier as Cold World, LS, Labels or 4th Chamber, the beat is... out of this world, to say the least.  The lyrics are golden as usual, and... I dunno.  I just can't stop listening to this song, but I always make sure I learn to the aforemented 3 before I turn this up.  Still a spottieottiedopaliscious (OK, sue me ;) ) track; also one of the more slept-on on this album.      I Gotcha Back - 4.5/5      Another great track and a good ending for the album.  Beat's dope, hook's straight & the lyrics are good, but the delivery is what elevates them to great.      Now, there *is* another track on this album... technically.  The track itself though (B.I.B.L.E.) is actually a Killah Priest track off his album \\"Heavy Mental\\" another classic.  Still, it fits in with the album very well and it's also a 5/5 track, beatwise, hookwise and lyric wise.      Overall:      60.5/65 or about 93%; A- to A      I'm going to round that to an A, though; I'm doing that because were it not for that stupid skit, this would be an A to A+ album.  And let me tell you, you're doing good if there's only one song that's not that good and 12 that are audio bliss.  Simply put, this is a masterpiece hampered by the extra baggage.  An extraordinary accomplishment for any emcee, and it just adds to the rep of the Wu Tang.  Wu Tang Ain't Nuthin To F*** Wit' indeed.
0399226907|3.0|I really feel it was not worth our time to read this book. The pictures are cute, but the caterpillar eats fruit, then junk food, then turns into a butterfly. My child couldn't even sit through the whole book and she loves reading. It was not stimulating to her little brain and I was appalled that this book gets such good ratings. There are way better books out there.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Don't waste your time with this nonsense.  The story is altered to the extent that none of the characters' actions make sense, none of the original ideals are portrayed, and no understanding of the novel's intent is achieved.  The A&E production was of such high quality that I easily recommend it to those who don't wish to read the book; there's simply no improving on that one, and this piece of trash should be forgotten by the movie-going public.
0671449028|5.0|This colorful board book is a real joy! The moose, elephant, bunny and cat get ready for bed together in the most entertaining way. Boynton encourages children to take there bath, put on their PJ's, brush those teeth, and exercising in a nightly ritual. This so closely matches our child's bedtime ritual that she excitedly exclaims that she has PJ's also!! If you child is shy of the scrub, scrub, scrub of the bath or the brushing of teeth then this is a fun way to get them involved with their new friends who are also getting ready for bed. Enjoy - you can't go wrong with this one.
B000UR9T82|4.0|I would have liked to have seen Special Features on Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 & 2.1 respectively. Especially if this is really the only way to own the first two movies in the trilogy in HD. All that aside the movies transfer beautifully from Standard Def to High Def. and if you want the trilogy on Blu-Ray knowing of the lack of special features for all but Spider-Man 3, pick this up.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I saw this initially on HBO and was blown away.  Enough that I purchased it for myself and for my father who is a Vietnam vet.  The commentaries from actual survivors is an incredible touch.  This is a series I think everyone should see, especially young people who feel like WW2 is so far in the past it doesn't affect them.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|i didn't get to see the live show but i'm a beyonce fan since from back in the day. i love the dvd version of the concert. the colors are great the audio is good, i love the dancing. i feel like it's pure entertainment. i played a bit for my parents over the holidays while they were at my house and even they enjoyed it. again for the price you can't beat it for what you get, a high-energy, entertaining show.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I have FINALLY completed this series. SEE THIS IN HD! I have never witnessed such a beautifully filmed/documented compilation as this. BBC went overboard. 200 person crew dispatched to 40 locations worldwide, one of the largest budgets in history, in HD mind you, and things you would NEVER see in a lifetime. This HD DVD set is WELL worth the money and the camera follows the beautiful, fearful, bright, and dark ecosystems from pole to pole...continent to continent. An encompassing view of mother nature's beauty and fury. HIGHLY recommend adding this to your collection. This set is worth buying an HDTV just to watch.
B000Y179KO|5.0|How do they keep putting out such inovative and artistic stuff after all these years. I bought the DVD of the Australian live concert and was amazed at how beautiful it was recorded. the new CD has awesome harmonies we've all come to expect from the Eagles. I can't believe how little it cost to get a double CD in an industry where it is ok to put out 10-12 song for more than $18 or more. I especially Like the song Fraile grasp for its lyrical content. No more walks in the woods for its harmony and I could go on.
B000VR824S|5.0|I'm so pleased with this DVD. THis was purchased as a Christmas Gift, and my brother in law is thrilled with it.......I would highly recommend it
B000001EHS|5.0|If you are looking at this you should already know what is on the cd. If you don't the sampler will give you a heads up.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Those who don't love this film won't understand why you'd want a grand slamming total of FIVE cuts of one movie.  Considering how much time I spend  criticizing multiple releases, I don't know why I would either.  Except for this one.  \\"Blade Runner\\" was an enigma during its first U.S. run.  It created a gritty, dysfunctional, and totally real future.  It was difficult in the extreme to watch and understand, with the many layers of story, graphics, and complex characterizations.  It created the last great \\"film noir\\" in the most unlikely of settings.  And it was bleak.  My Lord, it was bleak.  This was a Los Angeles that no one in their right mind would want to live in, even if given a chance of a happy ending that Deckard seemed to get.    The dystopia as replacement to a bright and shining tomorrow was a touchstone idea, and drove the popularity of the \\"Cyberpunk\\" movement to follow.  The cinematic imagery would lay the foundation for much of the \\"new breed\\" of sci-fi film and television to follow.  The, true fans found out there was another version....    The later cuts would demonstrate that even beyond the U.S. release, \\"Blade Runner\\" was a difficult movie to pidgeonhole, and that's what made the journey through each successive cut so damned exciting.  Even without    them, the original had riddles that demanded we solved them through the same painstaking detective worl Deckard used.  The acting was so top notch, we knew we had a new breed of heroes, lovers, villains, and chorus members worth getting to know and love.  The ultimate question of even Deckard's identity, so beautifully clawed out of Harrison Ford (proving that, if anything else, he CAN act and has the chops to play so charismatic and troubled a protagonist) is but one of a multitude of deep questions.    Everyone in this movie has something to be proud of, and even with only \\"Blade Runner\\" as a successful project on their resume, they were a part of something special.  A few truly deserve to havetheir later careers reexamined for something beyond what audiences and their fellow creative types saw as \\"failures.\\"    The package itself is worthy of the complexity of the movie. Sure, there's the collector's goodies thrown in, which are fun for themselves.  What's finally done right for the movie is the sheer damn amount of video treasures included which demonstrates both to the longtime fan and those who want to get to know it why \\"Blade Runner\\" is worth all this time, attention, and, yeah, I'll admit it, obsessive love.    Which is why its so influential in the first place.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|This is the best one yet. Alice has more powers which came in handy. Well, its some what predictable you know like there being zombies all over and the good guys having to fight back. The ending was great though. There being hundreds of clones makes me wonder what will the next movie be like. Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to people who liked the first two movies.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|An absolute mess that tries to be an adventure story, a silly farce, a serious drama, and a scary mystery.  It ends up being none of the above, just a chaotic mess. It looks like a lot of beautiful sets were built for this movie, which made me keep thinking, \\"What a waste of beautiful sets.\\"
B000YXMMAE|1.0|Just what I need, some sissy boy whining over a clatter emanating from the IT closet. Chopsticks and voice-activated gameboy chatter; casio groans and simulated needlepoint pollution. I've said it all before, they've said it all before. Check out my laptop, me whackjobbin' over some phriendster phunk.<br /><br />I'm nice and sleepy now, aren't you? Lullabitch. Tonguesilled entreaties. \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi?\\" (Clap, clap) Didn't Steely Dan already steal that riff from Sly Stone back when Nixon was playing Caped Crusader in the broom closet? ...<br /><br />Anyhow, the main reason I'm writing this review today is to let everyone know that my brain surgery was a success and, keep your fingers crossed, the doctor says I might one day regain my wits -- but it's going to take years and years of therapy.
0552998087|5.0|This is without a doubt the funniest book I have ever read.  One of the kind that tears are streaming from your eyes so that you can't see the page funny. This is a fantastic read for anyone that endured car trips with their parents when they were young.
B000B5IOUW|5.0|good movie for people who like stuff a little on the bizarre side but still a good movie only works on the psp.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Last night I had the pleasure of watching Ridley Scott's masterpiece Blade Runner in beautiful HD DVD. Blade Runner is the story of a Deckard, a retired cop played by Harrison Ford who returns to service to hunt 4 Replicants - humanoid robots - built by the Tyrell corporation that threaten the peace and civility of 2019 Los Angeles. An erie look into human existence with technology in the future, Blade Runner is a dark movie. This HD DVD version has fully restored audio and video by Ridley Scott. In a :37 introduction to the movie the director says this HD DVD version is his favorite - we agree.<br /><br />Despite the dark colors and tones the image was as clear as you would expect from a our beloved HD DVD format. I have seen this movie many times on VHS and cable. In those formats the picture was grainy; sets and characters blended togather. On our HD DVD format the depth of the images was astounding and added new life to this cult classic. The TrueHD audio does not disappoint and adds to the future environment portrayed by Ridley Scott's images.<br /><br />Along with the 2007 HD DVD \\"final cut\\" version the 5 disc set includes a making of Blade Runner documentary, various behind the scenes featurettes, the obligatory director's commentary and some bonuses including the original theatrical release in 1080p, the international theatrical release in 1080p, the 1992 remaster in 1080p. On top of all that content included also is a first cut of the movie. Truly a collectors set. I opted to get the $34.00 5 disc set from Best Buy on my way home from work. I have to say it is quite a value, 5 discs for $34.00.<br /><br />So should you buy this movie for your HD DVD collection? Yes. absolutely. The picture is beautiful, the attention to detail comes to life in HD DVD. The audio is a  model for HD DVD mixing and the special features are over the top. Unfortunately it did not pass the wife test. She is not much of a film noir/sci fi movie fan.
B00005JKN9|3.0|talks about the prohibition era back in the 1860's good movie a little bit of violence. I loved Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie he's really good actor.
0691126658|4.0|\\"Birds of East Africa\\" by Stevenson and Fanshawe is generally a good field guide.  The layout is fairly standard, typical of most good field guides for birds.<br /><br />Some of the colours seemed a little off to me.  The yellow wagtails I saw in Uganda were not as yellow as the plates in the guide, although I may have been seeing juveniles (not shown in the guide).<br /><br />The poses of the birds were mostly a little static and did not show the birds in typical habitats.  The illustrations seemed mostly dead, lacking a sense of the live bird in its habitat.<br /><br />Usability in the field is an important design consideration, and the design of this guide could be improved.  To find a bird quickly, you have to flick through a 6-page table of contents, or refer to the comprehensive (but longer) indices of both scientific and common names.  Then you have to locate the right page, but the page numbers are quite small.<br /><br />Newman's \\"Birds of Southern Africa\\" uses a much better system.  The major bird groups with reference pages are on the inside of the front cover, making for rapid location.  Major groups are colour-coded, as are the corresponding pages.  Page numbers are large.  All these design features make Newman's mush faster and easier to use than \\"Birds of East Africa\\".<br /><br />Stevenson and Fanshawe have written a good guide, but it could have been so much better with more attention to usability and more vivid illustrations.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This show is so brilliant. The small subtile details that draw you into the story and make you apart of these quirky characters. plus.....I am pretty sure SHerilyn Fenn in this role was the hottest a woman has ever been on tv :) It's one of those shows that translates well into today too....it doesn't feel dated.
B000BCE918|4.0|The pictures for this product show a tri-fold case in a box that opens with two doors on the front.  This looks really cool, and is what I was expecting.  However, the one I received has the tri-fold case in a basic slip cover.  Not a big deal, but I was kind of looking forward to the cool packaging. Has anyone else had this happen?  Still 4 stars for the incredible price!!
0143038419|3.0|An open, honest acount of a spiritual, emotional and physical journey to happiness, contentment and fulfillment. It helped me gain some insights for myself. I feel it would be helpful for women (and possibly some men)  going through relationship breakups, and who are searching for more meaning in their lives. Contains some very rich imagery.
B0009A40ES|5.0|This movie is incredible in all regards. It involves the American Dream and how it has been corrupted. It shows the dark side of the yuppie culture of the 80s that no one could have ever anticipated. We see how pathetic, meaningless, and insane wealth and image can turn our lives. We get all of this in the form of Patrick Bateman, the successful Wall Street executive with chiseled abs and a model girlfriend. He lives in a society where the costliness of suits, the beauty of business cards, the quality of cocaine, and the number of women banged matter more than character and personality. In this culture, one gets friends by having the latest Huey Lewis and the News CD, the most posh designer suits, and the most enviable haircut. The fact that Patrick Bateman's violent crimes against humanity go unnoticed by his peers shows just how our MTV culture has desensitized us to the real issues of our world, such as war, poverty, disease, social injustice, etc. If you were happy enough living with your fellow Wall Street buddies, would you really care about the Africans with AIDS?  In this movie, Patrick commits the most horrendous of crimes. He kills homeless men, prostitutes, a cat, and even an old woman. He revels in the amount of blood that he lets flow. The sex in this movie is relatively intense and \\"sadistic.\\" After all, women are like designer suits for Patrick: things that you can dispose of as you please. However, the blood and sex in this movie are nowhere as disturbing or graphic as they are in the original novel.  Many people argue about whether those around Patrick don't know what he does simply because it's \\"all in his head\\" or whether the yuppie culture simply could care less about violent crime (meaning that Patrick actually commits the portrayed crimes). I feel that the answer is both. The shallowness of our modern society desensitizes us to our real problems and consequently distorts our perception of reality. This new fake reality is one of greed, lust, jealousy, frustration, and endless longing.  The beauty of this movie lies in how much it still applies to modern society. Though we don't live in the 80s, we still have many of the same problems of the 80s, including AIDS, drugs, warfare, and poverty. We still live in a MTV culture that has evolved into one of reality television. Many of us eagerly watch shows like \\"The Simple Life.\\" Knowing full well of the growing gap between rich and poor, so many people still envy the lazy lifestyle of frauds like Britney Spears. An interview with Paris Hilton can beat out an interview about health care on Larry King. Is that how shallow our society is? Frankly, YES. Many people still have little knowledge of the upcoming presidential election. Obviously, though, some Hollywood actor's new haircut matters so much, right? I may be ranting, but this is the reality of modern America. If you think that America has changed for the better, you are wrong.  Anyway, this is a brilliant movie, especially with regards to acting. As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale pulled off a sensational yet realistic performance that was so enthralling and eye-pleasing that he should have won an Oscar for his actor. It is very difficult to give a performance that requires the right balance between being suave and being sinister. The other actors are all perfect. Reece Witherspoon plays Bale's snotty and lousy girlfriend and does superbly well.  People label this movie as horror. It should be considered a black comedy. One cannot but help laughing during the business card, Paul Allen, and stray cat scenes, all of which are brilliantly crafted.  If you like this movie, I recommend the original novel and any other Christian Bale movies (e.g. Empire of the Sun, Batman Begins, and The Prestige).
B00005JPS5|4.0|I think the reviewer, R. Christenson (11/3/2007) got it exactly right with his review.  This movie has some great jokes and people were laughing aloud in the theater.  This movie isn't a Shrek, but as the other reviewer stated, it's definitely in the better half of animated movies, such as Cars, etc.  Overall, I really liked this movie...much, much more than I expected to.  I only went because my son wanted to see it.  I thought it looked like a real stinker.  The fact that it made me laugh and smile was a refreshing surprise.  I plan on buying this on DVD.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Wicked, watched the whole season in less than a week.  Living in the UK the only way to watch Gilmore Girls is to get it on DVD.  Great ending, couldn't stop putting the next disc in.  Give yourself a treat.
0590259385|5.0|I didn't read this book until my older kids (now 11&13) were in elementary school.  When my new baby (16 months) was born, they wanted to share it with her, too! She also loved it but the paper back was soon in pieces. The board book is perfect for her little hands, all her slobber and she loves the rhyming!
0060752610|4.0|I suppose that this edition--released after Jason Zweig released in 2003, the revised 1973 edition with his commentary jammed in between the chapters--was released to show people what Graham really wrote in his first 1949 text who might have not wanted a book with commentary inserted in it, and in its pure and unadulterated form.  I might say, however, that I'm reading the 2006 edition by Jason Zweig right now, and I find it far more readable.  The examples are more up to date there and the language is a little more modern.<br /><br />However, I must admit the merits of the 1949 edition: Graham himself said people need a better sense of financial history, and what better way to see the past than to read his original edition, and it's kind of neat to see what he was thinking when he wrote the book in the first place.  It allows the book to speak for itself, rather than telling you what it means in between each chapter, and I guess that's a positive in some ways.  It was written in the heyday of Graham's career on Wall Street.  Also, he warns on the first chapter that things mostly relating to specific securities would become completely outdated with time, but those precepts relating to human nature would remain the same.<br /><br />Boy was he ever right!!! Wall Street acts no more intelligently in 2008 than it did sixty years ago.  Just like a herd of frikking lemmings, all jumping off a cliff together!<br /><br />I recommend reading the 1949 edition first, to give you a sense of historical-financial perspective.  Then pick up a copy of the 2006 revised edition with Jason Zweig's commentary, and read that.<br /><br />What I don't understand is, WHOM did Graham write this book for in 1949 of all times, when only 2 million Americans, mostly upper-class, owned stock? Maybe he was prescient and saw ahead to now, when 90 million Americans of all walks of life own stock (and stock mutual funds).  If that's the case, this man is a prophet.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This is truly an amazing release for Blade Runner fans such as myself. The transfer is just spectacular. It really makes the films dark atmosphere shine. The special features are outstanding too, and I really appreciate the time and energy that must have been spent correlating all these interviews and fascinating facts.    However - and I feel bad making even one complaint about this release - but in all the 9 HOURS of special features there is HARLDY a mention on Vangelis's stunning score for Blade Runner. His work on this film was truly exceptional and I think the film would be a much less enjoyable experience without it. He really captured the brooding dystopia in his score. It really is a masterpiece of a score and I just find it such an oversight that there was NO focus on this within the myriad of special features. I understand that he's not one for interviews, but even a 10 min piece on the development and importance of his masterwork would have been much appreciated by fans... After all, he played such a massive roll in the emotion of this film.     I think scores in films are too often overlooked, which is a shame considering they add such a subliminally important roll in the emotion of film. A shame.    But I must end by saying WELL DONE to Warner Bros for an exceptional HD DVD release. Truly a stunner!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I will watch anything that Pixar makes. I was there at the opening of \\"Toy Story\\" and I fell in love with their charming animation. Woody and Buzz, even the little game-machine alien, were just as evocative as any big-name actor--and a lot more fun.    What I especially like about Pixar is they really do push the envelope. Think about it, they've made us come to care for bugs--and now a rat.  That's no mean feat.  I suspect Pixar's amazing talent could make a dungbeetle's antics hilarious and oddly appealing.     The story in brief, Remy (Patton Oswalt's voice) is a rat with taste. He's watched a lot of cooking shows featuring his favorite, Chef Gusteau and he's even learned to read Gusteau's book, \\"Anyone Can Cook.\\" He's hiding this information from his father, who has a different opinion.     Remy gets tragically separated from his family colony and begins to see the ghost of Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett's voice) and the Chef gives him some very good advice:    \\"If you're focused on what you've left behind, you will not be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around!\\"     Remy discovers he's in Paris, home of the best food in the world--at least, according to Parisians. And he's very close to Gusteau's restaurant.     Surreptitiously, he enters the restaurant to find there's a new garbage boy, Linguini (Lou Romano's voice) spoiling the soup.  Remy cannot help but 'fix' the problem.  The soup's a hit and Linguini's got a promotion, the problem is Linguini really can't cook.      So, Linguini and Remy team up.  Their communication and antics are hilarious.  Only the way, we encounter a hardbitten critic's critic, Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole's voice) who ruined Gusteau's restaurant in the first place and indirectly caused his demise, Skinner (Ian Holm's voice) who now presides over the kitchen of Gusteau's and hopes to inherit the empire.     The story's fun, and for the most part, predictable.  There is some wonderful French humor along the way too. \\"Ratatouille\\" was an interesting evening's viewing, but despite my Pixar Addiction, I doubt I will own this one.
0316010669|4.0|As with \\"The Tipping Point,\\" Malcolm Gladwell manages to be both insightful and entertaining with \\"Blink.\\"  A very easy and fast read, and yet there is a lot of thoughtful information presented on difficult topics such as racism and sexism.  It reveals the problems of trying our best not to be prejudiced, even toward ourselves.  If we slice responses thin enough, our intent is replaced with how we actually see the world - and we might not like it.
B000YENUI6|5.0|I don't see every Cronenberg film that comes out, but was intrigued by the premise of looking into the Russian mob.  GORKY PARK was my first venture into this subject, and, as with most movies about mob life, it repels and fascinates.<br />I admired A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, with it's message that violence begets violence---among the other several messages that come through---and saw that perhaps this film might be a further development of the theme in another context.<br />EASTERN PROMISES delivers on several levels.  Of course it contains violence, but most is implied, and the the touted bath house scene that I dreaded---since I am anything but a fan of violent films---was actually restrained.  The scene was utterly effective, not of long duration, and furthers the plot.  The acting is restrained and nuanced: the silence of Viggo Mortensen's character speaks volumes but gives little away as does that of Armin Mueller-Stahl, Naomi Watts, and Vincent Cassels.  It is photographed beautifully, capturing London the way I remember it---chilly, damp, and vibrant.<br />Cronenberg makes us think about his films whether we are inclined to do so or not.  I find myself haunted by the final shot of EASTERN PROMISES, knowing what's been learned about Mortensen's character.  Pity and terror have certainly been evoked.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I really like the new special features, but I didn't realize that it would just be a couple things added to the original DVD. (Although I'm super happy about the cast commentary. I love commentaries.) If you don't already own Serenity, buy this one. If you do, maybe just rent or borrow to see the few new features--the River Tam sessions are particularly interesting.
B00005JPD0|5.0|YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. IT IS ONE OF THOSE YOU CAN WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|While there is romance in this movie, it is not a romance, nor is it a cute costume drama.  William Wilberforce came to be known as the keeper of the Britain's conscience.  This movie shows us his struggle against slavery in the British Empire.<br /><br />The title of the movie comes from John Newton's famous hymn, Amazing Grace. Newton was a slave trader early in his life but when confronted by God turned his ship around and released the slaves he held.  While Newton was a friend of Wilberforce and is a part of this movie, the focus of the movie is William Wilberfore, (Ioan Gruffudd) who, when confronted by that same God, spent years working to abolish slavery and improve the life of man and beast.<br /><br />One reviewer has argued at length that Wilberforce was not a saint.  All who follow the call of God are saints, but they are also human and imperfect.  Wilberforce was both saint and sinner, but because he was not afraid to follow the call of God countless humans and animals had better lives.  In addition to his struggle against slavery Wilberforce worked to establish charity schools for children and also founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which continues to this day as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Britain.<br /><br />A few reviewers have stated the movie should have had more Africans or dealt more with the African experience, but the movie was not about Africa or Africans, it was about the parliamentary fight of William Wilberforce to make slavery illegal in the British Empire.<br /><br />Recommendation: As I mentioned in the title of this review the movie has history, drama and even a bit of romance. This is an excellent film.  I recommend it.  Five stars.<br /><br />Kyle Pratt
0375703764|5.0|Definitely not like any book you've ever read.  I found this book to be a page-turner and not at all as intimidating to read as I thought.  The actual book itself is 530 pages, and I admit I haven't read the entire appendix.  It was actually an pretty easy read, except for when you physically have to turn the book upside or hold it in front of a mirror.  The prose is mostly simplistic and straightforward with occasional forays into a stream-of-consciousness style in the footnotes.  The comparisons to Pynchon and Wallace are indeed absurd, as another reviewer stated... in terms of the strength of the prose or the encyclopedic intellect of their respective works.<br /><br />I found the Navidson story to be genuinely unnerving and unsettling.  I used to have dreams where I found myself exploring secret tunnels in the basement of my house or finding extra rooms that didn't exist in reality.... apparently Jung talked about similar dreams.  Supposedly in dreams, houses represent ourselves...so exploring a house correlates with expanding your own awareness. The Johnny Truant story did seem a little cliche in comparison.<br /><br />The innovations in the spatial layout of the text were constantly inventive and added an extra dimension to the narrative.  I have no idea how many of the ideas have been used before, as I am not familiar with the entire canon of modern fiction.  In addition to the layering and exploration of narrative art-forms (a film within a story within a book within a book being edited being read) you are never sure which sources are actual books or total BS...as he references both real books and invents his own facetious scholarly books/journals...as well as pens in cameos from famous artists and thinkers (D impersonating Kubrick for example) in addition to real quotes from literature.<br /><br />In the end, this HOUSE leaves you with the sense of experiencing someone  else's nightmare..similar to watching Eraserhead.  A HOUSE where you leave (but yet don't) to descend into the darkness, a HOUSE where the layout is as transient as the rustling of leaves...which is in fact where the couple ultimately end up... outside on the front lawn.  I have said enough, I will take my leave now.darkness, a HOUSE where the layout is as transient as the rustling of leaves...which is in fact where the couple ultimately end up... outside on the front lawn.

B00004XMV6|5.0|Mickey Rourke in my humble opinion has always been ahead of times, the Actor who displayed his talent in 1986 and rocking the industry ever since like todays 2005 Sin City and many more films coming up.  This film was simply a great movie, Kim is amazing and the director had done his homework keeping this movie on point with such mystery and endless topics one can talk about.  Amazon.com delievers fast and I gotta tell ya, this is the ultimate film among many of his work!
0425188809|5.0|This was a good Thriller.  I Love animals and the Way Dean adds man's best friend into his books is amazing.  Loved this book.
0060977493|5.0|It is hard to believe that the author of \\"The God of Small Things\\", Arundhati Roy, is a debutant novelist. Her experience as a screenwriter aside, Roy's literary genius knows no bounds her first novel. She is able to transform what is a rather ordinary plot, about a pair of twins whose lives are inexorably shaped by family and circumstance, into a haunting tale of struggle, passion, and the search for identity.     The effects of her linguistic skill can be felt in the indelible marks each of the characters leave on a reader. Roy infuses the plot and each of the characters with small, personal details which draw readers into the story. One will feel the humid, languid summer weather of Kerala \\"suffused with sloth and sullen expectation\\" and will convulse with anger and shock on behalf of Estha at the depravity of the OrangedrinkLemondrink Man.     This novel has been criticized for having a plot that is too convoluted, but that is, in my opinion, why it is so compelling. The book begins with a sense of apocalyptic doom, and as the story progresses, each layer of the mystery is peeled away with painstaking detail to reveal the causes of a family's downfall. The reader is pulled along through the highs and lows of the plot, often without being braced for what is about to come.     Although the book is set in India and is rich with details about Indian culture, it is by no means esoteric. Roy's writing is too exceptional, the story too heartbreaking and the characters too unforgettable for this book to be limited to any specific readership. After finishing the book, I was left with an importunate urge to go back and re-read it, this time on my own terms, savoring the lyrical prose, this time ready for the twists and turns.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|I can't add anything about the movie itself.  The only reason to buy these special editions is for the extra features.  Behind the scenes stuff, how the movie came about, interviews with actors who did the voices, ect.  If you care about those things, this is a great set.  If you don't, there is no reason to upgrade.
1400086035|4.0|Wonderful! In this busy time of year it's hard to find time to sit down long enough to read through the printed Dickens.  Having an unabridged copy of A Christmas Carol in an audio format is a great treat. I managed to listen to it twice, once on my own while wrapping gifts and baking, and once with my kids.    Jim Dale, as usual reads it beautifully, embuing each character with it's own personality.
0783219695|5.0|I liked the orginal movie and decided to upgrade to DVD when this edition came out.  In addition to the movie there are many special features showing how they made the movie, as well as interviews with the actors and astronauts.  Those feature alone are worth stepping up to this edition, even if you already own it on DVD.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|While this movie doesn't follow the original Spidey story lines from the comic books, it does a good job of capturing the comic action. I know they are looking at another sequel, but this really would make a good ending for the trilogy.

B00000K3CR|5.0|My VHS version was dying so I upgraded to the DVD and watched it for the first time in years.  It still makes me laugh after all this time.  This is truly one of Tom Hanks best early movies and is worth watching again.
0060989157|3.0|If you want to be totally grossed out, this is the book for you!!!<br />I knew it was going to be gross, but, I had NO IDEA it was going to be as bad as it was!Not a bad read, but will turn your stomach!!!!!!
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|The only reason to buy this version is the special features.  So I was very excited to put in the 3rd disk first and see what was included here.  The features there were a series of cast and crew home movies that were totally stupid and a waste of time unless you happened to be a member of the cast or crew and wanted to laugh at yourself.  The deleted scenes are interesting to see how some scenes were meant to be pieced together, but are not worth the price of the edition unless you don't own the movie already.    I decided to watch the actual movie and there are more special features about the making of the movie that you can either watch all at once, or as they are relevent to the scene being watched.  These are very good and are worth the cost of the edition if you have any interest in the secrets of how the movie was made.    The irritation is that by doing it that way you now have to switch disks in mid movie as if it were the VHS tape of the thing.      So if you are a real fan of the movie, or just movie making in general, this is a good collection.  Otherwise, don't bother.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My kids love to watch it. Has a good story line and good characters. I enjoyed it, as well.
B00005JPFH|3.0|I have been a Spider-Man fan since the early 1980's and have been excited as each of these movies has come out.  They are not 100% true to the comics, but generally that is ok.  Until this one.<br /><br />They have painted themselves into a corner.  With too many villains, no where to go with the love angle, so another girl must be found-at least for awhile-and trying to explore Peter's \\"bad boy\\" side, while the minor characters have their own issues to explore, which just muddies the water even more.<br /><br />It is too much to do well, and they do not do it well.  The fights and graphics are well done and the individual characters are done well within their own scope of the movie.  The cameo of Stan Lee was a riot.  But I finished this movie feeling very disappointed.  They can't cram 40 years of Spider-Man into one movie and should not even try.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is probably one of the best documentary movies I have ever seen in my life.  Everyone in Europe who is in favor of privatization of health care system should see what happens if you leave the HEALTH issues to the mercy of free market forces.. This was exactly what Karl Marx was trying to say a century ago but nobody listened to him...  With this movie Americans will understand once more that FREE health care is the moral debt of any CIVIL state to its society and it doesn't mean communism.  Bravo Michael Moore!... You are a great person!...
B000002LUB|5.0|I borrowed this cd from a friend when it was released in 1992 or thereabouts. I am a huge Dio fan as his singing and songwriting are second to none. Add in the metal Gods Iommi and Butler and a dash of Vinnie Appice and you have a great, and absolutely underrated metal classic. Powerful and catchy riffs that are as good as any songs of the Dio era. Perhaps better than most save for Heaven and Hell, Sign of the Southern Cross, Falling off the Edge of the World and Mob Rules. I'm telling you the songs I, After All, Letters from Earth and others off this album are right there with the best DIO/Sabbath classics. Those who gave this album one, two or even three stars are true idiots and were probably listening to their Winger albums when writing their reviews.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Definitely not for young kids but was visually stunning and a good story running through out. I added it to my personal collection and have shown it to many that have the same response. If you liked Gladiator, you will love this.
0143034901|3.0|It takes awhile to get into this novel.  It is very wordy.  You do (after about 300 pages) reach the point where you want to see what happens.  I had a good idea of the denouement, but had to finish the book to prove my deduction correct.  After a week will I remember the characters' names? No. Did I feel for the characters?  Not particularly.  Did it make me smile, laugh or cry?  No.  Would I recommend it?  Yes to someone who likes entertaining, romantic gothics, but not to someone who enjoys books who's characters you care about.
B000A6T262|5.0|This is an awesome collection for the true Trek fan, such as myself. The dual-disc editions for each movie is great, with special features, interviews, behind-the-scenes, etc. Awesome!!!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I have always been a big fan of Jim Hensons works and those that have followed since his passing. When I first heard about this movie I was very intrigued and couldn't wait. When the movie finally came out I went to see it right away and though it wasn't what I was expecting I was still overly happy with the movie in all.    Many complain about the movie stating that it's simply visual and the story is basic, and even a few others complain that it was too confusing and to these people I say Nay!    Yes the movie is very visual but it takes place in a world created by a young artist both through her artwork and dreams so of coarse the visuals are going to be over the top, I for one hate it when my imagination is over the top (sarcasm).    As for the story I don't quite see how it can be confusing or too basic, the only thing I can think of is that it may be a little to much to form with fairy tales. It isn't exactly a complex story but the story that is laid out before us is one that can be related to. Somone who doesn't like their life as it is now and dreams of something bigger, but then her eye's are opened and she realizes her life is perfect even though it isn't.
075640407X|5.0|This is ultimately a very standard sort of fantasy book done very well.  It's really the same fantasy story you've been reading your entire life: a boy grows up to become a legend and solves lots of clever and difficult problems along the way.  A bit of new ground is broken but this is no Erikson, Martin, Sanderson or Keyes.    Kvothe, our main character, is a great guy.  Maybe a little too great but charming enough that we can forgive him for it.  Smart, strong, brave and with a dashing mane of red-red hair to top it off.  This is the story of his life and the many things that he does.    Rothfuss writes well and has created a rich and interesting world.  The story reads as grown up sort of Harry Potter.  There's lots of great adventure, good friends and side characters, the hero is always heroic and as a reader its easy to get drawn in cheer along.    For me, however, it's about a 4.5 star effort (though I gave Rothfuss the benefit of the doubt and bumped it to a 5).  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it.  It's just that the book, unlike it's protagonist, isn't perfect and I did find myself getting annoyed with the writing at times.  The main character is just a little too good, too smart and too strong.  That won't be a problem for many but I found it difficult to swallow.  The story is very compelling but at times the conflicts seem a bit contrived.  I love that the heroine has a strong personality but ultimately I didn't find her to be that likable.  I'm guessing many would disagree but it's just my take.    While a bit of a cliched story, it's done very well and I can't imagine many fantasy fans won't find something to enjoy.  To compare it to more similar books I'd say it's less witty but better constructed than Brust.  It has better characters, better motivation and a better story than Feist could ever offer and I'd say it blows the likes of Terry Brooks out of the water.
B000VUDSH6|1.0|Where is Jackie Chan? I cannot believe the guy playing this super lousy film is J.C. Whoever he is, he is sooooo uncomfortable with his role. The whole movie is absurd, with no connection between scenes, ridiculous dialogue, impossible situations.  Funny? You mean grotesque.  Melodramatic? You mean ludicrous.  Action? You mean kicking and screaming like children. Female acting? You mean degrading women. In short, the worst movie by J.C. I have seen in a long, long time. And I will not go into considering the other guy playing J.C. sidekick. My goodness, what a miserable acting. And the rest of the players are pitiful, to say the least.  In short, do yourself a big, big favor, and forget this movie was ever made.
B00004TWZF|5.0|For those who didn't see the directors cut yet, this a must see. I saw the film years ago, & I'm happy I bought a copy of it. It's the type of film you'd like to watch more than once. Buy the soundtrack too!
B00009L1TA|3.0|Out of all of the films that I have ***ever*** seen,\\"Basic\\" is one with some of the strongest potential. The plot(a DEA agent investigates the dissapearance of one of his former military colleagues and learns two seperate stories about what happened,creating trouble)is just as intelligent as it is brilliant. Add that together with suspenseful scenes,twists,turns,and even dialogue,alongside a top-notch cast(John Travolta,Samuel L. Jackson,Connie Nielsen,Tim Daly,Giovanni Ribisi,Brian Van Holt,Taye Diggs,and Harry Connick,Jr.,with \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" director John McTiernan being the man behind the camera),and You've got quite a lot to make something very proficient.    Yet,despite all of the strong and admirable qualities of \\"Basic\\",there is something about it that fails. As opposed to \\"going by the book\\",\\"Basic\\" takes crucial parts of its story and takes the road less traveled and expected. Sure--it is something that can work great and make a film/television show/television show episode richly executed,if not better than the regular road. But,for \\"Basic\\",it completely fails. It is a method that turns \\"Basic\\" from being intelligent to being dumb--not making any sense in the end and leaving a bad aftertaste. Sure--it only applies for a few scenes. But--it applies for some of the most crucial scenes of \\"Basic\\". Once it is finished,there is no turning back. It is as dominant to \\"Basic\\" as anything in a real military base would be.    Overall,a film where the gamble didn't pay off. Worth to see for the unique and creative qualities--but be prepared for a large dissapointment in the end.    2 1/2 stars
B000002UAX|1.0|Wow - I had always heard that you must have the \\"WHITE ALBUM\\" by the Beatles and how great it is and diverse and classic.  Ummm...let me put it this way...I love Rock and Roll, I love the Beatles..but this is a compilation of experiments gone awfully wrong.  I could take a dump better than most of the songs on this album.  Granted there are about 4 classics on here that you should just download for .99 Cents but the rest don't waste your hard earned cash.  Use it to buy \\"True\\" toilet paper as this is expensive and is not as soft as Charmin but both can be used in the same fashion.  Buy Sgt. Peppers you will be happier.  Happy new year to all.

I suggest reading this book as well if you're interested in finding Mr. Right.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Ratatouille is one of my favorite films of all time.  It actually brought me back to thinking about one of my other favorite animated movie Toy Story.  There is a great story that both children and adults will enjoy.  It looks great on Blu-ray and is easily the best looking film on the format.  The sound is also very good as well.  If you're looking for a great entertaining movie that can also double as a reference title, look no further, this movie is it.
B00011KHTM|5.0|This product works well with connecting any Mac with a mini DVI port to a VGA cable.  The only problem I had is that Apple should have either included this WITH the computers at no additional charge.  No one should have to pay extra money for a feature (in this case the VGA port) that is normally standard.  One of the few changes I would make to the MacBook.
B00003CX5P|5.0|As in many of my other reviews, I shall start by saying that if you have a problem with the new movies, whether it be acting, directing, ect; and you only like the \\"Old School\\" Star Wars, then you are no Star Wars Fan. As a true fan I love all the movies. Phantom is filled with action and starts the series with a huge KABOOM! There are no continuity problems and it explains much that was not told in the original three. This just as Episodes II, III, IV, V, & VI is a masterpiece and should not be under rated just because you are over critical. If anyone has any questions about the movie or my review just email me at RevanFormVII@yahoo.com. I am willing to answer any questions to make this the most helpful review you have ever read.     May the Force be with you,    RevAnakin
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Must be seen/should be seen by young and old alike--especially by those who take freedom and democracy for granted.  Intelligently written and directed. Authentically portrayed.    Want to have some idea what it was like for the average citizen to exist in East Germany under Commie rule?  A living hell. Your worst nightmare.    See this film. Tell others about it.    Director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck  (believe me, I've had to consult--repeatedly--the box art the DVD came in order to get the spelling right) is a film director who ought to be saluted.
B000E41MS6|5.0|In late March of 2005, \\"Doctor Who\\" returned to television for the first time in sixteen years (Or nine years, if you count the sub-par TV movie from 1996). And the wait was definitely worth it! Russell T. Davies, executive producer and head-writer of the show, has done a terrific job of bringing a fresh spin on the old series, retaining many of the traits and characteristics that made the original a classic, while also bringing it into the 21st Century!<br />Christopher Eccleston proves to be a terrific choice as the Doctor, whose charm and humor are reminiscent of earlier Doctors, while he also brings more of a dark side than previous Time Lords. It's a shame that this would be his only season. Billie Piper is also excellent as the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. She has everything that you'd want in a companion: looks, sass, and smarts.<br />The standout episodes of the first season include: \\"Rose,\\" the premiere episode; \\"The Unquiet Dead,\\" the show's first period piece; \\"Dalek,\\" which features the return of the Doctor's oldest enemy; \\"The Empty Child\\" and \\"The Doctor Dances,\\" the two-part story set in London at the height of the Blitz in 1941, and; \\"Bad Wolf\\" and \\"The Parting of the Ways,\\" the two-part season finale that not only brings the season to an exciting conclusion, but also sees the departure of Eccleston, and the entrance of David Tennant, as the Doctor.<br />The DVD release is terrific, featuring great picture and fantastic extras. The only complaint I have is that the audio is a little off; the dialogue is buried under the sound effects and music at times.<br />Overall, this is a fantastic return for one of Britian's greatest icons. Fans and new-comers will not be disappointed!<br />Program/DVD Grade: A+

037571457X|5.0|Marjane Satrapi was a headstrong, privileged Iranian pre-teen in the 1970s when the Shah was deposed and Islamic rule came to Iran. Her story, told in stark black-and-white graphic images, is told here. Satrapi captures the cocky fervor of her youth as well as her fervent, sometimes-misplaced idealism. When the Iran/Iraq war brings enemy bombers to Tehran, she is as bloodthirsty as anyone about revenge -- when she isn't terrified of losing her parents. But mostly, the tale is about her adolescent attempts to subvert the increasingly repressive religious extremists who took over the country in the time of the Ayatollahs. Her secular family tried as much as possible to continue their western lifestyle, with dance parties and smuggled rock posters. But they lived always under the prying eyes of neighbors who were more than willing to denounce state enemies to the regime. The story ends with the family fleeing Iran for the West.<br /><br />\\"Persepolis\\" is part history lesson, part introduction to the Iranian perspective, and part memoir of a girlhood lived under frightful circumstances. The book is a quick read but imparts an enormous amount of information in its inked panels. I'm looking forward to picking up Persepolis II to see how things turned out for Satrapi and her family.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great series. Knowing that the stories are real and the characters are actual people who lived it helps to draw you in even deeper.  This is quite possibly the best movie or series about WWII ever created.  At the end of the final disk, if you aren't filled with pride, you aren't a true American, and if you haven't shed a tear, you aren't human.    The production quality is big budget blockbuster movie quality.  The camera work is amazing.  The actors do a phenomenal job.  Damian Lewis did a great job as Maj. Richard Winters.    I loved the way that each episode was done from a different soldiers perspective.  It allows you to get an better understanding of just some of the things they went through over there.  And having the interviews with the actual soldiers themselves just adds to the experience.    This quote says it all.  \\"I treasure my remark to a grandson who asked, \\"Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?\\" \\"No\\", I answered, \\"But I served in a company of heroes\\".\\"
0143038419|2.0|I don't get it.  What is all the hype about?  The author seems very naive and uneducated, especially considering she is almost a decade older than me.  I found the book so frustrating and irritating that I couldn't read past the first of the three sections.  All of the characters she described in her book were annoying- they reminded me of characters from a cheesy teenager movie.  The book is promoted as an insightful and spiritual coming of age book but don't let the hype fool you.  The book is simply boring and inane \\"chick-lit.\\"  I normally enjoy reading about other peoples' travels.  Judging from this book, she is definitely not someone I would want to travel with if I were to go to Italy, India, and Indonesia.

0440238609|1.0|Why is so much fiction in print full of bad writing? At some point, plot, characters, and imagination cease to be important. The glaring fault of this book is the writing itself - dull, flat, colorless. Philip Pullman, like so many other big authors of today, has absolutely no grasp of the power and beauty of the English language. His style lacks flow, ease, and grace. My opinion? Skip this series. The story isn't worth the poor writing.
0743496728|5.0|I don't really know where to start with this book review. This book made me cry and it terrified me with its treatment of the topic of bullying and insecurity and the very, very harsh, unforgiving world of teenagers. As a parent, I could all too easily place myself in the place of the mother whose son had always been shut out and bullied, and in the place of the mother of the daughter growing up far too fast, watching her daughter grow away from her. And the book will certainly cause you to stop and think of how YOUR life can be utterly changed, for better or for worse, in the timespan of 19 minutes. This book is not for the faint-hearted, nor is it for someone wanting a light unemotional read. This book is very real, the characters are very real, the situations are too real; this makes you think, and it makes you feel.
1563894696|4.0|I really enjoyed Batman: The Long Halloween. It was a really refreshing Batman story. Not quite as good as DKR or Year One, but not that much worse. The artwork was very reminiscent of old film noir movies, and the story itself payed a lot of homage to the Godfather. It gets a tad repetitive though. Nevertheless, Long Halloween is an original Dark Knight story which if you're a fan of Batman, you will not want to miss out on.
006085880X|5.0|I have yet to read a book by Jodi Picoult that hasn't completely engrossed me and kidnapped me until it's finished. Her books always, always take fascinating, often heartbreaking, topics and approaches them from directions you've never considered before. Her characters are very real, sometimes you love them, sometimes you really dislike them, but you're never bored by them.  I know one or two of her books have been made into movies (The Pact has, in fact), but I can't think of any of her books that wouldn't make a fascinating movie. This book was always hitting my heart and mind in unexpected ways, and I read it straight through!  A very, very, very good book.
0812523369|5.0|I loved it.  The characters, the conversations and the interactions between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were wonderful.  Even though it was written over 200 years ago, it was creative and enjoyable.  There was no sexual language and there were no sex scenes.  Setting: England.  According to Liz Ellerbe the setting was 1794.  According to another it was early 1800s.  I personally don't know.  Thank you to Liz for her input.  Genre: historical romance.

0451529308|1.0|After reading Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre, both written in the 1800s and which I loved, I thought I'd try another classic, Little Women. What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters.  Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.<br /><br />Data:<br />There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war. Genre: young adult fiction.
0143038419|5.0|Really, some of the reviews here are a bit harsh. Saying that she is self absorbed and all. Sheeh... Haven't we all been that way when we are unhappy and trying to find a way out of the situation? You truly cannot help anyone until you help yourself. Sure, people have bigger problems in life but none of us can help those people until we find our own center.     I loved this book and have for quite a while now. I ran across it at the library and remembered reading a good review about it. So I picked it up and fell in love with it and asked for it for Christmas. Unfortunately, it was a paperback. I tried to exchange it and pay the difference for a hard back but they are out of print. Sigh... Thats how much I loved it. Had to own it...in Hardback. Let me just say that I never buy books unless I plan to own it forever. Hers is one of those books.     In fact, my MIL was loaned this book by a family member and she found herself underlining stuff and dog-earring the pages until she remembered that it wasn't her book. So she had to buy a new book to return it. That's the kind of power this book has. Don't think about it anymore...Get it now!

0684853523|3.0|When 13 I read Stephen King's The Shining and was baptized into the horror genre.  I followed him through junior high and high school, and remember my English teacher writing \\"Keep Reading Stephen King\\" in my yearbook.  Eventually I moved on to other types of stories. Through the years I'd see King novels and in bookstores and was impressed at his longevity. After many years I recently picked up On Writing as it was highly recommended in the Modern Library Writer's Workshop.<br />The book was very helpful yet limited.  Positively, there was a good deal of great advice on the craft of writing. King's metaphor of writing being like a tool box, the need to ready widely and write continually, that the story is like a fossil needing to be unearthed and discovered (comparing a structured plot to a jackhammer that can destroy what might have been is classic), and discrediting the false myth that good writing and drugs go together. Also, his interactivity, in which he invites readers to write a story and send it to his website, is as populist as a writer of his success can get.<br />What limits On Writing is King himself.  His language throughout is not just vulgar, but is all out rancid.  He discusses this point, when writing about dialogue, and states that books must reflect life, even if the \\"Legion of Decency\\" (186) is offended.  Yet the examples he uses in this section are so far removed from the coarseness found throughout the book that his argument becomes anemic.<br />From the hindsight of eight years, King's chapter about his accident and against Bryan Smith seems aged, not belonging in a writing book that in some significant ways is better than other writing books I've read.  In retrospect Smith's tragic ending gives me more sympathy for him, and a writer of King's stature focusing so much on Smith makes King, in hindsight, look small.<br />King's book helped me as a budding writer: he reiterated things I've read before, brought my attention to things I'd not thought about, and took me through the writing process from first page to finding a publisher, plus included an insightful memoir of his early, fatherless years.  Yet he shows his own limitations and seems to delight in it.  Along with his teacher Miss Hisler (49-50), I too had hoped for more.took me through the writing process from first page to finding a publisher, plus included an insightful memoir of his early, fatherless years.

But I am certain to be addicted to this CD and book, The Heroin Diaries; and that is a gift.  Thank you Nikki Sixx and his band, Sixx A.M. for putting out the most incredible piece(s) of music I have heard in a VERY long time.<br /><br />Other than my favorite all-time band, Aerosmith, I have NEVER been more moved by a CD in my entire life.<br /><br />The book is bone-chillingly honest (I reviewed that already...) and this CD is just as mind-blowing, if not more.  The melodic, yet hard driven rock sound of these haunting songs, brings you to that place that Nikki so wants everyone to understand.  He so nailed it on this one, it is an absoloute masterpiece.<br /><br />During his addiction, the depths of darkness was as low as one can go.  Without his music, who knows if he had any other means of escaping.  I cannot imagine such despair, and I am grateful his god given gifts have saved him.<br /><br />This CD just blew me away; and does every time I listen.<br /><br />The lead singer is amazing; and has the voice to just pound out the passion of these genious written songs.  The remaining members of his band have more talent than the other members of Motley Crue can only wish for.  Sorry, but that's just my opinion.  Nikki is a poet, and an complete artist; and this collection proves that beyond any doubt.<br /><br />Nikki...  I never realized your talent; it's truly amazing.  I am so sorry for all the anguish you went through; it breaks my heart; as you seem to be an extremely intelligent man; so with that said, I shouldn't be as surprised to see you made it through.  There is a reason you are still here, and you know why also.  So keep going!<br /><br />I cry a bit (no, I cry hard...) when I hear some of these songs; the passion in the lyrics, it is just so strong and gets you right in that spot.<br /><br />I suppose I will never understand a mother and father's decision to just disappear, expecting others to raise their kids.  That is just beyond my comprehension as a mother.... who's witnessed it.  Nikki, I am sorry, and as a mother who's father of her son abandoned HIM.... I hug you right now.<br /><br />I am touched so deeply by this album and the diaries; it is rare, and it is a treasure.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind....  Parents whose wish for their sons or daughters is to JUST SAY NO... GET THIS CD! and his book.  The collection is your vehicle to open the lines of communication.  Isn't this ultimately what we want as parents?  The communication?  If you don't, and you don't subject them to this realism, you aren't doing your children any favors.  Drugs are out there, they are real, and they can destroy, anyone.<br /><br />Yes, it is raw, and yes some of the songs paint a not-so pretty picture; but isn't this the point?  The truth of the matter is....drugs give the illusion of happiness, they make one believe all is well in the world, all the while, they piece by piece, destroy your soul and leave you with nothing.  The more honest and open we are with our children about this fact, the more ahead of the game.... we can be.<br /><br />Drugs don't necessarily choose who they destroy, the bottom line is, they destroy, the ones we least suspect...period.<br /><br />Nikki's songs, and stories will educate them ..and QUICK.I suppose I will never understand a mother and father's decision to just disappear, expecting others to raise their kids.

1400063515|4.0|We are blind to Black Swans (unknown unknowns), because of the way our minds work. Luck has a much bigger role in our lives than we think. We should resist theorizing and stay forever skeptical. The information you have is probably incomplete or inaccurate. Don't jump to conclusions. And for all you investors -- Modern Portfolio Theory is junk science.  It is an enjoyable read but the author leaves you hanging out there. He does not tell you what to do with your money that might be sitting in the bank - at risk. Banks, he writes, are now so globally interconnected that they could now be hit by negative Black Swan. No practical guidance is provided.  On page 290, Mr. Teleb takes philosophers to task for believing and investing in the stock market. Their job is to ask all the hard questions about everything. They should know better. But he does not follow-up here and tell the professors a better place where to put their savings. The author does not in any useful detail disclose how he invests (and with what success) having the Black Swan, the philosophers can't see, always in his sight. As close as he gets to practical investment advice is on page 296, where he in vague terms states that he prefers \\"speculative ventures\\" (in small amounts) to \\"safe\\" blue chip stocks. That is it? With guidance like that the philosophers who have not \\"developed intuition from practice\\" are sure to stick with blue chips.   Benjamin Graham's \\"The Intelligent Investor\\", Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., gold and real estate (in my book recommend business-cycle proofed condos) do not even get a single fly-over from the Black Swan.  On page 106 Nassim Taleb writes that the tremendous success that certain CEOs enjoy is due to \\"...:luck. Plain Luck\\". Here would have been a good place to deal with Warren Buffett's extraordinary success (or is it luck?) over the long run.  Mr. Buffett says he is \\"wired differently\\". This suggest that he does not think it is just luck. Relating the impactof the highly improbable to the likes of Warren Buffett would have been an opportunity for the author to impart additional subtlety to his nuanced portrait of the Black Swan.  On page 57 the author writes \\"...that understanding how to act under conditions of incomplete information the highest and most urgent human pursuit.\\" I subtract one star because the author so obviously wise did not stick his neck out and do that with greater specificity.
0743486285|5.0|Let me start out by saying I was never a Nikki Sixx Fan, nor was I ever a Motley Crue Fan.<br /><br />I wanted the book because people like this are inspiring to me, and knowing who he is, I felt intriqued enough to put it on my Christmas list.<br /><br />I have read Nikki's book, The Heroin Diaries, and also own the Heroin Diaries CD, with his new band, Sixx am.

B000UO4F8E|4.0|To start, let's review the film itself.    The Jigsaw Killer is back, and he's got new test subjects to toy with. With the help of Amanda, his new apprentice, she sets the stage for their two unwilling participants in his twisted game: Dr. Lynn Denlon and Jeff Reinhart. Before the night is over, one will have the chance at life, another will have a chance at revenge, and another will have the chance for redemption. There's not much else I can say without spoiling the plot, and since this review is geared towards why this 2-disc DVD treatment is superior to the previous versions, let's move on.    Saw III has more plot twists than you can shake a broken arm at, and this film doesn't have too many characters to bog down the action as in the previous film. With a running time of 120 minutes, the Director's Cut of Saw III has more gore and violence than the last two treatments. If you think the directors have run out of trap ideas, believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of moments that caused seasoned horror movie fanatics to cringe and wince at the tortures unfolding before them on the silver screen. If you have already been introduced to the 'Saw' universe, Saw III is required viewing.    As for the DVD treatment of the movie, it's common knowledge these days that the first version of a DVD release is typically not the one with the best features, or the most complete version of the film. The most complete version comes later. The best example I can think of is the [[ASIN:B000K15VSA Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition)]] - I had to wait 25 years for that.    Thankfully, Saw III got the best DVD version (so far) within a year.     When you open the DVD, you're treated to a certificate allowing you to see Saw IV in the theaters for free. However, the ticket was only good until November 10th of 2007. Even if you buy this DVD after that time, the certificate makes a nice collectable for Saw fans.    When you put in the first disc, you have to wade through 5 movie advertisements before getting to the main menu.     At the main menu, there is an endless one minute loop of \\"Killer Inside-Messed Up World\\" playing in the background. It's my belief that DVD menus shouldn't have music playing, and this is a perfect example: The song is WAY too loud. I'm sure it was put there to direct viewers to the music video on the second disc - but it's simply an annoyance.    Some of the features on the first disc include:  -- Audio commentary by Leigh Whannell, the co-creator of SAW.  -- Audio commentary by Director Darren Lynn Bousman  -- Audio commentary by Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) and Shawnee Smith (Amanda)    There's one choice in the special features section for \\"D-Box, Mastering Motion\\" - this is a shameless promotion for a company that offers a new way of experiencing motion in movies with special chairs/helmets/etc.    On the second disc, there's a mixed bag of special features.     First, we start with \\"Jigsaw's Plan\\", a trivia game that tests your knowledge of the three Saw films to date. However, the questions are not randomized and if you get one question wrong, you have to start all over; making the replay value of this feature almost non-existent.    Nest, we have \\"Choose the Death\\" which allows us to view the scenes of 10 Saw traps from Saw 2 and Saw 3 with commentary from the director. Not a bad feature.    The next feature is \\"Looking Tortured\\" - I'm not sure who came up with this idea, but it was a pleasant little surprise. 4 people are chosen to have makeup applied to emulate their 'Saw' counterparts. The viewer is shown from start to finish how to create & apply the makeup to look like the perfect Saw victim. Anyone who wants to spend $25 on a Halloween costume can watch this and make a better one themselves.    Hydrovibe offers us a music video of \\"Killer Inside-Messed Up World\\" with Shawnee Smith offering additional vocals. This video wasn't bad, but it felt like it was tacked on at the last minute. You'll probably find yourself saying \\"Hey, isn't this that annoying song playing in the background on the first disc?\\"    \\"Filmmaker Faves\\": This feature is totally unnecessary. Do you lay awake at night wondering about Leigh Whannell's favorite line/scene/trap of the Saw series? This is good for trivia night, but it's really not needed. Plus, the font of the lettering is hard to read here.    The last feature is a \\"Sneak Peek at Saw IV\\". This scene is mainly to wet the appetites of those folks eagerly awaiting the next Saw movie to come out on DVD, and they will not be disappointed.    The first batch of SAW III DVD's were out in January of 2007, The \\"Unrated Edition\\" and the standard edition. Both of these DVD's had features that did not make it to this version, such as some deleted scenes, commentaries, and trailers.    If you are looking for the longest running, most complete version of Saw III, this is the version for you.     Gift Card or Credit Card...make your choice.
B00062I6TO|5.0|Carlos Kleiber is music himself. And since I'm such a big fan of this great musician, I just have to write this review. Kleiber's performances are always refreshing, so detailed and refined, yet so direct and simple, like there can't be another way since it's utterly convincing. You can  rediscover how wonderful music is from watching and listening to them. And whether he wanted it or not, Kleiber made the likes of the widely popular Karajan look like a business man on podium.  This particular concert would give you a joyous, energetic and exciting spirit for a beautiful new year. If you like the Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Concerts, this and Kleiber's 1992 are wonderful to have.

0316166685|5.0|This book was, quite simply, the most touching piece of literature I've read in some time. The author takes her readers on a journey that begins with a terrible, horrific event. Sebold's gift, however, is to gradually put distance behind us by perpetually moving us forward in the healing process, so that the shocking event appears smaller and smaller and in the rearview mirror of our mind. We, along with every character in the book, gradually travel through shock, grief, anger, acceptance... and healing.<br /><br />Well written, a good read (I couldn't put it down and read it in a day). Bravo!

0765357151|4.0|My 14 year old son gave me this book for Christmas since I expressed an interest in seeing the movie and he knows how I almost always believe the book to be better than the movie.  So what I have to say is that the novelette/short story of I AM LEGEND is very well-written, compelling and hard to put down.  I am frustrated that the book is marketed as one novel or one story.  It is actually a collection of short stories from author Matheson.  It is amusing now to think I read the whole book waiting for things to fit together after page 170.  Needless to say I became more and more confused and (STOP READING HERE IF YOU PLAN TO READ--PLOT SPOILER AHEAD)I kept wondering how the book was going to go on when halfway through, the hero dies.  All the time I was reading completely different stories.  SO anyway-----it is well worth the read, but it should say somewhere on the front or at the front that the book is a collection of short stories.  Thanks!

0061544493|4.0|I received this book as a gift and could hardly wait to begin reading it. I couldn't resist initially flipping through the glossy pages to get a sneak peek at all the great pictures of VB. I loved seeing some of her more famous outfits drawn on paper by the designer then to be realized on her.  Hey - if only we were all so lucky to have designers lined up to dress us. I'm a big fan and was happy to see she 'kept it real' with 'victoriaisms' throughout the book referencing her children, mother, sister or gorgeous hubby.  Each subject is broken out by intuitive chapters and truly a fun read to all the girly girls out there. I'm looking forward to trying some of her recommended makeup & treatment finds.  The only drawback was that many of the recommended stores were all based in the UK. It would have been nice to have seen a variety of niche US brands/stores other than the classic Saks, Gap or Abercrombie & Fitch.  Oh and one more thing - she prefers an 11cm heel... that's a 4 1/2 inch heel to US girly girls.

My husband asked for this book for Christmas, and although we haven't had a chance to peruse it thoroughly, he is very pleased with the gift.  He bakes bread often and is interested in her recipes for breads as well as other French recipes.

0805079831|5.0|I highly recommend \\"The Shock Doctrine.\\"  It has shown me many connections I had never seen before, and it is also an engaging read.  I got it because Randi Rhodes of Air America radio said if you read one book this year, let it be \\"The Shock Doctrine.\\"  Go on You Tube and Naomi Klein's website to hear further discussion about the book and to listen to Klein herself.
B0007939NO|3.0|A charming lyrical film adaptation staring the celebrated dance chorographer, Gene Kelly, collaborating again with distinguished Hollywood musical director Vincente Minnelli .<br /><br /> Another vibrant and melodious  world.  After loosing their way, two American visitors (Kelly and Johnson) eventually find themselves at a secluded Scottish village which holds a mysterious enchantment, where shortly (Kelly) is soon captivated by a young lass(Charisse).<br /><br />The film has a pleasant simplicity with duration of 108 minutes. Unusual for Minnelli, whose silver screen cosmos is like been on a continuous razzle dazzle merry go round. Kelly's energetic on-screen presence never fails to display magic and bliss and by the end of the film, you don't have a worry in the world. Sadly at the time when the film was made, it had received some poor reviews and received little recognition at its release.  For any Gene Kelly fan, there is nothing stopping you to view this great film.<br />Enjoy!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Hubby started watching this show this season so he hadn't seen Season 1.  I got him these DVD's for xmas and he was so excited.  I was a little concerened over the few negative reviews, but decided to buy the DVD's anyway.  With that said, I am so glad I got them.    As for the negative reviews, I have no idea why people are saying the video quality is sub-par or that you have to watch a clip from another movie, etc. before being able to see the 12 episodes.  We found these DVD's to be excellent quality and we had no problem putting in the DVD and going right to each episode.  As for the show, we are hooked (me included)!  Great show, great DVD's.  I Can't wait to watch season 2 now.  Enjoy!
0439882826|5.0|Got this at the last minute for my 4-year-old son without actually looking through it (I know, bad parent!), but was pleasantly surprised by the ridiculously complex paper mechanisms that make this pop-up book work. The painterly artwork style is also quite unique and works well throughout. My only wish is that there were more pages (I think there's about 10-12 spreads) but each page usually has a secondary flap or smaller pop-up surprise. You'll have tons of fun opening and closing the pages to make the characters and creatures look like they're moving, fighting, biting, flying, etc. Not to ruin a surprise, but this book even has batteries! Kids younger than 4 might ruin the pages by accidentally tearing certain pop-up mechanisms, but the paper stock is fairly rigid and I haven't had any problems yet.
6304602979|3.0|Someone told me they thought this was one of the most romantic movies of all time. Hello????? I must have missed out on all that romance with all the violence, blood baring, drug dealing and sniffing, and all the other shamful,  bad behavior going on throughout the movie. As far as an action movie, bad boy, crime movie goes, it is ok.Guys will like it that's for sure. I have to agree the cast is superb. I was really surprised at the gathering of wonderful talent in this movie. I was surprised because the script is an odd choice for some of the greatness of the actors.    Brad Pitt is a hoot! There are some good laughs in this movie. Very violent though, beware. Still I don't get the appeal with all the other mafia type movies out there. Can someone help me out here? I guess I worry about movies that glorify illegal behavior in the name of love.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This is a great movie...I loved it when it first came out and I still love it!!
0385040253|5.0|This book is everything I hoped for!  I previously purchased Graumont & Hensel's Encyclopedia of Knots, but as I did more research kept hearing about Ashley.  I finally got it and it does have material about most every knot known.  I would recommend it as an anchor for anyone who does fancy work, research, or uses rope on a daily basis.  There are other web sites and books that have better details for tying the knots, but nobody has all of them in one place like Ashley.  I would have liked to have purchased the first ed., but did not have the money and this edition does have corrections or clarifications.  Anybody who buys it should be well pleased with their purchase.
0141023384|1.0|I was at first pleased to find a book that was written by an African, as well as one that discusses African traditions and customs. Not only that, it has also garnered enormous acclaim and praise from critics. However, after finishing Things Fall Apart and mulling it over in my mind, I now feel let down by author Chinua Achebe. While I managed to learn much about the culture of West Africa, particularly the traditions of the Igbo people in modern day Nigeria, as well as the effects of British imperialism, I was not enthralled by the sharp transitions, harsh and simple minded characters, and lack of a well developed story.    With a title ironically derived from a European poem (The Second Coming by W.B. Yeats), Things Fall Apart chronicles the adult life and exploits of Okonkwo, a member of the Igbo tribe who rose from humble beginnings to become a simultaneously respected and feared farmer and warrior. Okonkwo's fervent adherence to tribal customs of manliness and his tendency to conform stem from his desire to retain all that he worked hard for and now holds. To ensure that his legacy will live on, Okonkwo instills these values in his eldest son Nwoye by any means possible, even through abuse and alienation. The first major part of the story is an exhibition and explanation of various tribal customs, and describes Okonkwo's role in the special events and daily occurrences of life. Extremely detailed accounts of tribal processes in practically all aspects of life, from cooking to farming to law are given by Achebe. These descriptions are interesting to readers like me who have never been able to acquire much information about African culture, yet I was not able to relate or even sympathize with any of the characters. Okonkwo is the protagonist, but is a misogynist and narrow minded savage who is only able to command the respect and admiration of those around him through fear and violence. Other characters are either colorless and do not possess personalities that appeal to readers. Extremely simple language makes the novel far too easy to read, and makes the themes of the novel too obvious for readers.      What I despised most about this book was its sudden transition from relative calm to swift and destructive action following Okonkwo's accidental shooting of another tribe member. Okonkwo is punished by being exiled from his village and sent to live in his mother's village for seven years. Upon his return, Okonkwo finds his world turned upside down by the British settlers and their lifestyles, which contradict all of his values that he cannot compromise on, leading to his suicide. It is this overly quick change from an exposition of sorts to an actual plot that completely derails the reader and damages the novel. I feel that this novel fails to provide an adequate link between the two stages of the story, and that the two parts should have been completely separated into two different books. Only the second half the novel seems to have any actual plot, which proceeds too rapidly and without much explanation of the facts. The novel ends with an anticlimax, just as much of the book itself is sobering and disappointing, but this conclusion suits the story well and provides an appropriate ending situation for a novel on imperialism.     The amount of description of objects and scenes in this novel was remarkably vivid, as well as its explanation of tribal culture. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed was that it provided interesting accounts of tribe life and the effects of imperialism on Africa. These qualities, however, pale in comparison to the bland and poorly structured story that Achebe has created, and the unappealing and cold characters that populate the novel. Critics have referred to Things Fall Apart as the quintessential African novel. This novel, however, has given me a poor image of African literature, and deserves to be read only by those who have the time required for progressing through its simpe language and unappealing plot.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|There are some Blu-Rays that leave one wondering whether it was stupid to buy the Blu-Ray version over the redular DVD.  This is not one of them.  As far as the movie goes, it is an absolutely awseome action packed film.  The video is what sets this movie apart from the so-so action films because the battle scenes just come to life off of high def. TV.  The sound doesn't take a back seat to the video as the surround sound of this film takes over the room.  This is a great buy for an action film lover.
B000W4KT64|2.0|After I saw the Broadway version of hairspray, I was smiling; on an immediate high that lasted for weeks. I was excited to see this movie especially with the addition of zac efron to an already pretty amazing cast. When the soundtrack was realizes I was SHOCKED to discover that Mama, I'm a big girl now was not on the soundtrack, a staple a felt to the Broadway show. When I saw the movie in theaters it just went downhill. Nikki Blonsky seemed energetic and cute enough but right from the start she didn't do justice to the play. Nobody did. My favorite scene is Ladies's Choice, a scene that was not in the broadway play so there was nothing to ruin. I was disappointed with the movie, it was good enough but the play is way better
B000002GQL|5.0|This 1972 release by the Moodies would prove to be their last studio release until the Octave album (1978).  Apparently, certain band members had become burned out, were not very happy, and were wrestling with various philosophical and spiritual issues (Mike Pinder was especially troubled on a spiritual level); all of which is documented in the liner notes of this reissue. As such, the band went on an extended hiatus. I have to say that, in spite of it all, this is an excellent Moodies album and a fine way to close out the series of seven classic albums released during the 1967-1972 timeframe.<br /><br />The lineup on Seventh Sojourn included John Lodge (electric bass guitar, vocals); Mike Pinder (vocals, piano, and Chamberlin M4 [the Chamberlin was invented in 1946 by Harry Chamberlin and is the predecessor to the Mellotron.  The M4 was built in 1972 or so.]; Justin Hayward (electric and acoustic guitars, vocals); Graeme Edge (drums and percussion); and Ray Thomas (flute, harmonica, vocals).  For a group that was on the verge of disbanding for several years, it does not show in their performances and everybody is in top form.<br /><br />Musically, Seventh Sojourn presents a collection of excellent pieces including the bright and cheery song For My Lady (another fine track from Ray Thomas) and loads of the beautifully sad compositions that make the Moodies one of my favorites.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is John Lodge's thumping rocker, I'm Just a Singer (In a rock n' roll band) which closes the album out.  I especially like the wispy, haunting textures of the Chamberlin, which is used a great deal on the album.  Despite the fact that the Chamberlin is cited as sounding better than the mellotron, I do not hear the difference.  At any rate, although this album does continue in the tradition of A Question of Balance (1970) and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1971), there is (to my ears) a greater evenness to the tracks on Seventh Sojourn.<br /><br />This remastered album is pretty good and features informative liner notes and excellent sound quality.<br /><br />All in all, this is another great album released by the Moodies during the height of their creativity (and popularity) and is recommended along with Days of Future Passed (1967); In Search of the Lost Chord (1968); On the Threshold of a Dream (1969); To Our Children's Children's Children (1969); A Question of Balance; and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.stered album is pretty good and features informative liner notes and excellent sound quality.<br /><br />All in all, this is another great album released by the Moodies during the height of their creativity (and popularity) and is recommended along with Days of Future Passed (1967); In Search of the Lost Chord (1968); On the Threshold of a Dream (1969); To Our Children's Children's Children (1969); A Question of Balance; and Every Good Boy Deserves Favour.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|i love this album so much. It has great songs 1 through 10 and i just think it is outstanding. My favorite song on this album is the song nude.  If you bought this album,  you at least have to listen to the song. I just have to say that the band is outstanding and is the most by far, the best band i have ever listened to. And as well,  i would rate this album a 5 star definitely.
0142004235|5.0|When I first found myself assigned the task of reading East Of Eden, I was intimidated by its length and wondering about its significance and how impressive would be. When I finished the entire novel, there were no doubts in my mind about its ability to apply to all humanity and meld the Bible into the lives of ordinary people. I was absolutely entranced by this book. It is a masterfully crafted work of literature that deserves to be read and digested by all people, and is rightfully placed as a classic.    What makes East of Eden such a masterpiece is that author John Steinbeck melds the theme to fit all humans, no matter what their background is. Steinbeck brings the Biblical tale of brothers Cain and Abel to prominence in the novel, focusing on this Biblical allusion above the many others also used. The feuding brothers Charles and Adam Trask represent one generation of the Biblical duo, and Adam's sons Cal and Aron carry on the symbolism. Although readers are inclined to sympathize with the slain brother Abel the two characters that represent him in the novel (Adam and Aron), Steinbeck skillfully blends good and evil to give readers a sense of empathy for Charles and Cal, who do not receive the same degree of attention and devotion from their fathers that their brothers possess. Cal is the person who constantly feels the need to change his environment, which in effect leads to harm, yet he is genuinely searching for love and recognition from his father Adam Trask. Using this situation as a major conflict in the novel, Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of love to all human beings and the need for love, and the dangers resulting from deprived love.     At certain chapters, Steinbeck diverts from the story and delves into philosophical discussions about human nature and the themes circulating in the novel. It is in these chapters that he explicitly mentions the ideas and motifs placed throughout the book, and the chapters further enhance the uniqueness of East ofEden. A wide variety of other Biblical events and characters are represented in the story as well, including Jesus, Jacob, Adam and Eve, the garden of Eden, and many more. The entire story is not a stale Biblical parable like one would think it is, but is actually an intriguing tale with a number of different storylines crossing together that succeeds in keeping the attention of readers. The major element that keeps East of Eden exciting and enjoyable to read is the constant conflict between good and evil, involving characters such as the thoroughly villainous Cathy, the sagacious Samuel Hamilton, and the wise, soothing Lee. Steinbeck uses these contrasting characters to depict the neverending struggle between good and evil that pervades the story. It is this battle that makes East of Eden such a constantly appealing book that all people can relate to. Steinbeck's skillful treatment of characters, conflicts and the themes of struggling for love and avoiding extreme actions succeed in making any reader interested and feeling relation to the characters. The message of the novel is best embodied through the character of Lee, the intellectual servant who introduces the word \\"Timshel\\", meaning \\"thou mayest\\", indicating that people are able to have control over personal futures, and carrying the story's idea that all people can choose their own paths in life. The strength of the book comes from its ability to apply to all people, which is what, according to Lee, the best stories are able to do.    The writing styles used by John Steinbeck in East of Eden are truly remarkable and something to admire. Steinbeck's skill in describing a scene or object in fresh and exciting methods and his ability to narrate in a dry voice that still captures the attention of readers is what makes the book enjoyable. When touching upon the themes in those certain chapters, Steinbeck writes as if he were engaged in actual conversation with readers, and immerses them into his explanations. Toadd humor to the novel, Steinbeck intersperses the narration with sharp and insightful comments about human nature and the motivations and actions of people. For much of the book, Steinbeck's language is simple but conveys deep meaning and accurately paints the images of the novel in a way that is easy for people to comprehend. Readers may feel that East of Eden is far too long to be read quickly, but the storylines and conflicts will keep readers hooked and eager to delve into the story and analysis.     Overall, East of Eden is a deeply entertaining novel that accurately reveals human nature and the difficulties and trials surrounding the lives of human beings. Steinbeck efficiently blends in Biblical characters and themes and elevates the struggles of ordinary people to as religious level that has relevance for all people. Such an accomplishment is rarely achieved by any author, making East of Eden a unique novel that is interesting to read and discuss.

B0002YLC24|5.0|After reading all the negative reviews for this beautiful movie, I felt compelled to write a more accurate review.  Most of the complaints I saw was that it was only talking.  Yes, the movie is nothing but the 2 main characters walking around Paris talking.  For me, it is the ultimate people watching.  The movie has a voyeristic feel.  It is full of romance, and tragedy.  It is fascinating and thought provoking, and leaves you wanting more, mostly because like the first movie it leaves you wondering what is going to happen to them.  If you prefer movies with minimal dialogue and more so crap getting blown up then skip this movie, but, if you enjoy movies that make you look at the world and yourself then don't miss this movie.  Word of advice, if you have not seen Before Sunrise, see that before you see this.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies-- wonderful music and a really satisfying story that improves upon repeated viewing.
B000QQH4YS|1.0|One of the major selling points for me in buying this from Amazon was that it was on sale for $8.99 and I believed that Robocop 20th Anniversary was only available in a Steelbook case! The picture on this site shows a case with rounded corners which regular plastic keep cases don't have and several of the reviews on Amazon mentioned it as the following examples show:    \\"Cool tin packaging aswell!\\"  \\"the box is metal and I loved it\\"  \\"I saw this steelbook 20th Anniversary Edition\\"  \\"a limited edition tin case\\"  \\"ROBOCOP (20TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTOR'S STEELBOOK EDITON) PUTS THE OTHER EDITIONS TO SHAME\\"    Unfortunately the Robocop (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)DVD I received came in a standard plastic DVD keep case which I didn't even realize was an option as it wasn't mentioned anywhere? This item has only been out a few months so when they say limited edition they mean it!
B000UJ48UO|4.0|I am A retired Marine (21 yrs) The movie did an outstanding job on the part of Marine Corps bootcamp.Anyone ever wondering what Marine bootcamp or Drill Instuctor's were like need look no further.

B0007IN318|4.0|Harris did an excellent job of merging historical fact around fictional characters and events, all set within the larger and all too real volanic eruption.<br /><br />The author has a very good writing style that I found very easy to \\"plug\\" into and was taken away by the story.<br /><br />This is a good page turner and anyone interested in Pompeii will find it an enjoyable read.
0930289234|5.0|This was my first serious graphic novel and to be honest when I first opened the book I was turned off by the art in looked like your typical \\"The Phantom\\" strip which as a child always thought was boring but after a while it grew on me and turned into an amazement at the detail that was placed into each panel as well as the dynamics of them. The story was not a turn off. From page one I was interested and had me reading late into the night. No wonder it was on Times Greatest Novels list. I can't wait to see how this movie is done. Hopefully it comes out more like the new Batman (Dark Knight) movies then Spiderman, Hulk, Fantastic Four (gag) or other pop superhero movies. A must read for anyone looking to branch out from typical reads (books) to more exciting mediums (graphic novels, web comics, manga, video games, interactive novels, etc)
B000O599ZS|3.0|Throw your hands up and gnash your teeth all you want, sure I'm probably stupid to you, but to this 24 year old this seems like something old republicans sit around and enjoy, and only halfway pay attention to at that. Call me what you will but I don't think westerns ever got good until the Italians started making them, and Clint Eastwood got involved. I know this is one of the most influential films of all time, I can see and understand it when I watch it. Its almost like a real film is writhing under the plastic old timey Hollywood coating just wishing it was clever and free enough to break out. Its hard for me to appreciate old Hollywood westerns, especially when at the same time the Japanese were making far more realistic portrayals of human conflict and violence in their own western setting with the samurai film, completely free of any hokey cornball BS you'll find in this fossilized turd.

B000F7CMRM|4.0|After having recently watched \\"Rescue Dawn\\" which had an unsatisfying beginning, middle and ending and \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" which was a beautifully done movie but quite depressing - worth it nonetheless - Syriana was refreshing. An intelligent set of plots that interweave throughout the film, coming to a satisfying though not particularly cheerful climax. It leaves you with no regrets however and, as my wife put it, it tackles some tough issues (the kind where too many directors would resort to demonizing to bring the point home) in a very mature, complex way. The world is complex and as much as we'd like to simplify it down to one full of angels and demons the truth is we all have a little of both in us.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Now that they've officially been killed by their own hype (back in the early 2000s (oh, what magical time!) they were dubbed nothing less than the Saviors Of Rock, and that was before their first album even came out), it's become much easier to appraise the Strokes and their music. When Is This It first arrived on the scene in 2001, people were expecting something along the lines of Elvis' second coming. Preferably, an Elvis who had payed careful attention to Bob Dylan,  John Lennon, Johnny Rotten, Johnny Ramone, Johnny Thunders, Ian Curtis, and Kurt Cobain. When the album didn't manage to live up to those standards, it was dubbed an overhyped false alarm by some, and a media-victimized classic by others. After that, the Strokes' moment in the sun was over: Their next two albums were all but ignored by the press, and now, a scant seven years later, people talk about this record like it's a period piece.     All of which is incredibly stupid. I mean, was the music scene in 2001 so utterly lifeless that people felt the need to get so worked up over (either for or against) this album? No, it's not an absolute masterpiece- the songs are fairly derivative, and a lot of them sound suspiciously similar. If you've digested the Velvet Underground, R.E.M., The Smiths, The Happy Mondays, etc., then this music should all seem pretty familiar to you. It's indie-pop plain and simple, with a bit of detached NYC hipness thrown into the mix, and the Strokes pulled off the neat trick of taking it to the top of the charts. In their wake followed the likes of Franz Ferdinand. It also happens to be a very good indie-pop album, full of catchy hooks and fuzzy guitars and frazzled vocals and clever little lyrics. I mean, how can you not love a song like \\"Last Nite,\\" with its bubbling 60s pop-style guitar line exuberant vocals? Same goes for the relentless build of \\"Take it Or Leave It,\\" and the spacey, hypnotic \\"Hard To Explain.\\" There's also a lot of beauty in songs like \\"Someday\\" and \\"Soma.\\" It really is a great listen. Just don't expect it to knock the earth off its axis.
0606229302|4.0|Exciting, fast paced narrative.  Reads well.  A wee bit disorganized, but not to avoid.
0312360266|2.0|I've read enough vampire/fantasy books to know what I like. And this book was not it.     I pushed through the first couple chapters, as difficult as it was. I tried very hard  to like the supporting characters, to like main character. I tried to be enthralled by the plot and story that was playing out before me.     I finally found something interesting when Zoey got to the \\"vampire finishing school\\". But alas, it didn't hold up. The whole story seemed very generic. Of course she had to be special, of course she had to have an nemesis in the form of a Mean Girl-esque Queen Bee.     Also, I usually look for that one romance plot to hold me over-that one couple I would \\"ship\\" for. Zoey/Erik is the usual couple I root for, but they lacked chemistry (disappointing really).    I feel like the authors had a great plot bunny on their hands. But they didn't work with it as best they could have. If its a YA vampire book you're looking for, try looking somewhere else.
0307387151|4.0|When my wife asked me what I thought of the book I said, \\"really good book but with an unsatisfying ending\\". The plot was interesting and well-executed although not the typical kind of book I would read. If I were to sum up the story without recounting it I would have to say it is about the consequences (positive and negative) of the kind of rash actions we all commit. The author takes us to outcomes that would not normally take place but that are believable nonetheless, especially in a country so recently free of war and yet on its way to another. As for the unsatisfying ending? Any of us who have lived long enough are well acquainted with unsatisfying endings. Sometimes it's nice to escape this reality when indulging in a piece of fiction.
0385720920|1.0|Not sure why everyone liked this book. I could barely read it be/c it was so weird and yet boring. There was no life to the book the character was so gray and dry. Don't waste your time.
0760748675|5.0|This great story could be called a psychological thriller, a horror story, or a morality play. Maybe even science fiction. It is a superb tale of the corruption within each of us. Wilde convinces the reader that Vanity is a part of every human life. The ultimate vanity is to deny this.<br /><br />Very enjoyable story from a witty author.

006112429X|2.0|Although very well written, and certainly a compelling plot, the story suffers some serious flaws. Is the reader to believe the mother's account of her son's horrifying behavior and not wonder why, over the course of his 15 years, indeed no one EVER broached the fact that he might be severely disturbed and in need of outside help? The title is misleading - not one person ever says to the two self absorbed parents \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\". For this reason the book didn't work for me.
0385504209|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, i wanted to find out what would happen next. good read.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|There are many positives about this recording. As always, the playing is great. Rush is a band of creative, skilled musicians; something we need more of these days. I also appreciate the variety of textures in each song. With only three band members, it can be easy to have the same sound all the time. This is clearly not the case with this recording. Geddy's singing, while it is not the reason people buy Rush CDs, is pretty good as well.     I was always a fan of \\"the good old days\\" of 2112, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, but I have always been open to what creative direction the group takes. There are a couple of issues I have with this recording, however, which were even more evident on the previous CD, Vapor Trails. The problem is that the music lacks direction. The songs are just \\"there\\" and don't seem to take the listener anywhere. In my analysis, there are two causes of this. First, the chords are not normally progressing chords that facilitate the tension and release that push music forward. Therefore, to establish the key they are in, they seem to return too often to the chord of the key they are in. The main chord in a key is always heard as a point of arrival. Since there are too many arrivals, there are too many places where any phrase could have ended, so the musical phrases seem to go on and on like a run-on sentence.    The other factor that contributes to the lack of direction in the music is the fact that there are virtually no silences in the songs. The volume and intensity level rarely breathe. It's like there is a constant underlying drone of sound in every song. Silences are needed to better set up accents and hits. Think of how well such silences are used in songs like the Overture on 2112, or Freewill (think of the phrase \\"I will choose freewill\\"), or \\"Show, Don't Tell,\\" or \\"Xanadu,\\" or \\"Limelight.\\" Think of the changes of intensity in songs like \\"Cut to the Chase,\\" \\"Territories,\\" or \\"Virtuality.\\" These are important ingredients in pushing music forward. A lot of fine musicians forget that silence is sometimes just as important as notes in music. So, as much as I want to like the recording, I can only give it 3 stars.

0525950079|5.0|I have just finished reading WWE and I feel as though I have lost good friends.  Ken Follet has again created a strong and intricate tale of good and evil, triumph and failure.  I only wish there was another one waiting for me to begin.  Since he ended this one in the 1300s, I am hopeful he will not stop there.  I will eagerly await the next one!
B000X9Q8A4|5.0|I love it. If you liked the movie, then this soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile purchase :D
0723257639|5.0|This set is costly, but worth the expense for a lifetime of enjoyment. My children love holding the individual copies, and each book provides a little background on each book and a picture of the author. Beautiful set!
0307387178|5.0|What a great book! I started out thinking that Chris McCandless was a crazy idiot, but halfway into the telling I found myself agreeing with his ideals and wishing he were still alive. I was totally engrossed by the writing, Jon Krakauer tells the tale of \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" with dignity and sympathy. However, I could have done without the two chapters dedicated to his own failed attepmt at climbing a mountain; it came off like unnecessary filler and/or unwanted self-promotion. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be inspired to make a change in their life, but is too scared to try.

1400079179|1.0|I will be brief, for there are plenty of reviews which you can read here that I completely agree with.<br /><br />This is an extraordinarily bad book, for any number of reasons you may imagine. It is, quite possibly, one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is so simple, bad, awkward, and cliched, it is (quite literally) painful to read it. After I did, I felt like I needed a shower.<br /><br />I prefer not to think that it was a great bestseller, and what that means for today's culture and people's level of general literacy. And I also prefer to forget that it was recommended to me by some people I otherwise respect.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: stay away from this book. Just about any other book would do much better.
