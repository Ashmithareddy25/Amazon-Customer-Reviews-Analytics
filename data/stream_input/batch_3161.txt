B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. The whole hunger games series is fantastic. Would highly recommend this book and the others in this series
B001EC3JME|5.0|Bought this for daily use with my streamlight strion. Works excellent for my needs. Doesnt have a lot of ruff edges or sharp points, which makes it very comfortable to wear while driving.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Frank Miller's \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" was one of the seminal comics of the 1980's - its gritty, violent re-interpretation of Batman as an aging vigilante brutally restoring order to a hellish urban landscape won widespread critical acclaim and, along with \\"Maus\\" and \\"Watchmen\\", cemented the idea that comic books could be authentic graphic novels with adult appeal.  The series re-popularized the character and probably helped greenlight the Tim Burton Batman films, which pretty much created the modern superhero film genre. I read the collected version back in 1990 and enjoyed it, but I never quite considered it the equal of its two aforementioned contemporaries.  This film is an animated adaptation of the first half of Miller's series.<br /><br />  SPOILERS FOLLOW:<br /><br />  The film takes place in an alternative 1980's some ten years after Batman's retirement from crimefighting.  A middle-aged Bruce Wayne is now drinking heavily and spending his time at racetrack driving hoping to recapture some of the old adrenaline thrill of superheroics. Many Gothamites consider the Batman to have been an urban myth, and the city is terrorized by the Mutants, a vicious juvenile gang.  The horrendous toll of violent street crime leads Wayne to once again don the mask, and his brutally effective methods inspire a young woman to become the new Robin.<br /><br />  From what I remember, this is a pretty close translation of Miller's vision.  The art is modeled after the series, and the dialogue and story are basically taken straight from the original, though some of Batman's interior monologues may have been condensed a bit.  The animation quality is quite good and probably the best of any of DC's straight-to-video superhero films.  Certainly the spirit of the story is very true to Miller, with his political satire intact (liberalism is presented as academic psycho-babble and capitulation to evil; Reaganite conservatism as pandering inept jingoism) and an interestingly unlikable protagonist - this is a nasty and thoroughly violent Batman with nothing but contempt for the law. Willing to break bones, spill blood, and even use guns, this is definitely not a family friendly interpretation of the character.  As with the original, the viewer is left to decide whether this Batman is a sociopathic thug, warrior-hero, or necessary evil.<br /><br />  Its certainly an intriguing spin on a character who can legitimately be called an American myth, and fans of Miller's original and those who enjoyed other animated interpretations of Batman and wouldn't mind seeing a darker version should enjoy it.  I think the film suffers a bit because the source material, while effectively dark and intelligently crafted, never really soared above pulp to become a serious exploration of its central character.  I remember reading a review describing the original as an \\"R-Rated Batman\\" and taken on those terms both the original and this version work pretty well, but there's a lack of depth to the characters that makes it fall short of greatness, at least to my mind.  I may be a bit spoiled by Nolan's trilogy, which proved it was possible to tell intricate, paychologically moving stories using the character. That said, things don't have to be great to be enjoyable, and if the idea of watching an iconic superhero sneer at society's sanctions sounds fun, you'll probably like this.  If not, well, you can always rewatch 2008's \\"Dark Knight.\\"

0307593312|5.0|I like Murakami!  Especially the calm voice, the surreal scenes that seem to blend nicely into realistic events.  Like a dream
B000LXQVA4|4.0|My baby has lived this since 4 months when I got it. It is too tall so I stick a board game under his feet so he can touch the ground. The bug and lizard are great but the tiger and rainbow on the back side are really dumb and uninteresting. The tiger only pops up less than 1/2 inch. The seat does not swivel easily to the back but I don't care because the back toys are not that fun and the front toys keep him happy.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Great book to find out what you're so naturally good at that you don't know everyone doesn't have the same talents. If you are looking to change careers or make different and better choices for yourself and want to see yourself in a new light, I HIGHLY recommend it!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Different look and vibe with this episode. Very immersive story and twist from the norm. Wish they would make this departure more often. Good to see another side to the Governor.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|The DVD is awesome.  Very high quality, very affordable.<br />Great piece of entertainment to add to my existing Aerosmith collection.

B00GIY5OGC|5.0|Awesomely entertaining!!  I really enjoyed this movie,  would love to have my Grandchildren with me would have been a true highlight,
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Okay, so now that you have watched all of the previous seasons, this is Chuck growing into his own. I thought the writers could not do more and better than the past, but, no they pretty much nail it.  (By the way, if you have missed the earlier seasons, start by purchasing them now!)  More action, more comedy, more surprises, more family, and, yep, more romance.  Lovely last episode!  You might as well get Season Five, while you are at it.
0399226907|5.0|Who doesn't like this book? It's colorful, the story is funny and babies and toddlers love it! I like the format of this book, where the counting of fruit has pages that are slightly smaller than the others, so you can basically peek behind them to see the next fruit.<br /><br />My son is 26 months and we only last week donated this to his daycare. He doesn't read it regularly anymore but he still enjoys it.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I liked the movie, BUT, I would not recommend this to someone who has not read the book. If you haven't read the book it could be a little confusing!
B008602KQI|2.0|It's a boring movie, I feel like I'm watching the Matrix again. The characters aren't interesting and story feels like a Matrix ripoff.

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|A good movie but not one I want to see again , I would recommend it to friends for a movie at home.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|the app would not install then when it did it would not open so I deleted it but I enjoy the app on my phone

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|simple and convenient, but wish there was a way to delete individual items off of the &#34;Most Recent&#34; list; don't like the all or nothing delete option there.
B00506NRBS|5.0|If you believe it is possible to have a financially sustainable -- even thriving -- business done with caring for others as the first priority, read this book.<br /><br />It is written very simply, wasting few words, with its key lessons as memorable lines such as &#34;Delegate, don't abdicate.&#34;<br /><br />Much of the book's content could be found if you searched on Derek Sivers' blog.  To me it is worth the $6 to have these inspirational lessons curated here in one convenient book.<br /><br />If you have read other biz books like this one -- brief, heart-based, lessons based in fact -- I'd love to know...  comment below.<br /><br />I also recommend going to Sivers' website and reading his book summaries.  They are very helpful, and paraphrased in his pithy and inspirational style.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and this app. works great.  Every once in a while it acts up, I just uninstall &amp; install it again.  That has happened maybe two times.
B00C6ZDBXU|4.0|I think this band is great. They are proficient on their instruments, and very professional performers. They have great taste in the songs that are chosen to cover, and their originals are strong as well. This is one of the rare instances when I greatly prefer them live on the various videos I've seen (like Jools Holland, BBC Radio 6, Glastonbury) over this CD. Being produced by Chris Thomas I was expecting a better recording and better mastering. The CD is very much part of the &#34;loudness wars&#34;, with mastering that is very fatiguing to listen to. It's a shame, The Strypes deserved better.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|match three game. enjoyable however you can not play at will have to wait for lives to be restored is kind of a let down.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the best YA books I have read in a long time. I use it with my student teachers this semester.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|Not very happy with the free version of the app.  More than 75% of the functionality is blocked, not enough to do a full evaluation to see if it's worthy of purchase for my 3 yr old granddaughter. Sorry....
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Having read Forgive Me Leonard Peacock and having seen the film Silver Linings I felt a need to explore that odd voice of mental illness. I felt Pat healing and could sense that slow but steady change in his narrative voice.  A good read. Rather surprising this day and age.
B005LLXB9K|4.0|I think it goes without saying that this is a must-have film for Pearl Jam fans, especially those who want to learn more about their history and get a more behind-the-scenes look at the interaction between them.  Cameron Crowe is a phenomenal filmmaker and obviously a huge fan of music, as his film &#34;Singles&#34; was heavily focused on the Seattle music scene that begain to dominate in the early 90's.<br /><br />The early parts of the film are focused on the death of Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood, and how his death affected the community.  Cameron included a lot of very early footage from those days, mixed with new interview pieces to provide a thorough backstory to the origin of Pearl Jam.  From there, it shifts into telling how they acquired singer Eddie Vedder and his integration into the band and the Seattle community.  I see this film as more of a character study than a simple timeline-based story of the band from its creation to current state.  The Foo Fighters released a documentary called &#34;Back And Forth&#34; which was similar in regards to showing how the band was formed but then closely followed what was going on within the band as each album was released.  I would have liked to see more of that in Pearl Jam Twenty, but there were some poignant moments that I did appreciate, such as Cameron sharing the actual &#34;Momma-Son&#34; demo cassette that Eddie recorded his vocals on, and Stone visiting his old apartment where he and Jeff first listened to the demo.  For PJ &#34;nerds&#34; this kind of footage is like gold simply for its nostalgic value.<br /><br />Even as closely as I've followed the band, I learned a lot about their early days from watching this, especially in regards to their relationship with Chris Cornell and how he was a bit of a mentor for Eddie when first arriving in Seattle.  It's a great film for PJ fans, probably not enough to turn non-fans but a great wealth of knowledge and footage for those interested enough to know more..
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Very very good movie. Another highlight of the Denzel Washington filmography. It start like an action movie but turns into a good and powerful drama.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Just the right amount of information for a beginner. Clear and organized. It will help me get something published online.
034580404X|5.0|Such an enticing story. I fell in love with every character and all they're stories. I so very much hope the author comes out with the Christian's version of the story. I also hopes she writes a few more trilogy's, so I can move on to another.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Nice to have these three books all bound together into one. I thought the series was sort of lame but the idea of the plot was very unique and so that made it fun to read.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|My daughter wants this so bad for Christmas she has not got it yet, but I'm sure it will be fine
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Absolutely loved, loved, loved this movie! I've seen it over and over now and can't recommend it highly enough!  my only warning is to make sure you have a full box of tissues next to you when you sit down to watch it because you'll need it - it's a tearjerker!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I read all 3 books in about two months. The entire series is a great ride in personal discovery, choice, friendship, and courage. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this genre. Looking forward to the movies!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the greatest book in the history of the world! What more can be said about it? Without this book in your hands you are doomed.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I completely love this game. It's fun, it's challenging at times and it's the only time that I feel like I can accomplish something.
B001DJLCRC|2.0|I remember back when I had cable AMC was a completely different channel. I know they are trying to provide edgier content to keep up with HBO & Showtime, but I was a little disappointed with some of their choices when making this series. It is well acted & has great writing with an dark sense of humor. Just could do without the cursing, nudity, & graphic sex scenes. Not having those in it wouldn't have detracted any from the show. I guess just not really my thing.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|One of the more useful utilities I've seen.  I just got it so I give 4 stars now, may revisit.

B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Ok,  this game is almost as awesome as me! Mining,  fighting bosses, exploring,  there's just so much to do! if you love this,  get the computer version on Steam. its only $10 !!! SO WORTH MY $$$!!!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is a great movie and has great plot. The main character Gerry (pronounced jerry) is a good man who worked for the UN and retired early to spend more Time with his family until the plague of zombies comes. The only problem with the movie is that they cover so much distance In a few days. It's not to gory or creepy. There is only a bit of language but not to much. Over all I really like this and I think you should watch it.
B00GSE92F6|1.0|Amazon, I'm disappointed in you. Yes, the original $3.99 price was substantially lower than the price on iTunes. Guess what? That's why you were going to get my business, and iTunes was not. I am a person who believes strongly in purchasing my online media entertainment legitimately in cases where it is not made available for free by the network, but even someone like me can find ethically supportable alternatives if necessary. In this case, I will probably view this product via DVR recording at a friend's home.<br /><br />Next time, may I suggest that you either research the going rates before launching a new product, and launch with your intended price, or stick with your original price out of respect for your customer base, who have made purchasing decisions using that information.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I think I'm well informed about what's happening weather wise in my town and other places I want to keep track of. I like the severe weather warnings have come it handy because I know if I need to cover outside furniture or bring plants inside.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|It makes a change to listen to some classical music once in a while and have several of Andrea Bocelli's CDS.
B00005JNS0|5.0|The best Pixar movie, period. We love it, our kids love it. It's classic. We only wish the 2nd one and Planes were better. Oh well. At least we still have Cars. We also like Mater Tales.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Can't get it to work on my Kindle Fire won't load like the one with ads that I just brought.
B00F522C7C|1.0|We were very disappointed with this movie. After watching nearly all of the Pixar movies we're wondering how they let this one out of the studio. It is boring, confusing and simply not good. The visuals aren't even extra special. The woman commentator voice is strange. Do not waste your money on this one. Get MU or Bugs Life or other classic, good Pixar films.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, but some levels take FOREVER! I think maybe it's to en courage the purchase of boosters.
B000QEIORG|5.0|Classic Foo Fighters album, re-released with some great new additions !..especially Baker Street, which is even better than the original.
B00ENXBUR2|4.0|In retrospect, I should've ordered the one with the mini figures.  This one is really cool, but I mounted the case high on a bookshelf.  Now, when I want to watch the movie, I have to get it down then attempt to replace it.  There are magnets on the bracket/stand to hold the case, but you have to have it perfectly balanced in order to keep it from falling over.<br /><br />I loved the movie.  I thought it was really well done.  I did have some issues with it, but I got over it.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|Superior game play and graphics and the detail is excellent. 're a lot enjoy it. Can't wait til I can finish the ending
1476758581|4.0|This is a good book.  Don't get me wrong.  But I was a little disappointed that Rhonda Byrne seemed to be ripping off a movie I saw recently called Finding Joe.  (Great movie, by the way.  I'd rank it up higher than The Secret, believe it or not.  If you haven't seen it, watch it.)  Finding Joe (the movie) talks about the Hero's Journey and finding the courage to break away from &#34;status quo&#34; (i.e. a crappy life climbing the corporate and social ladder) to finally do what you're really meant to do in your life (or your purpose).<br /><br />When I first ordered this book (via a pre-order), I didn't know what Rhonda meant about Hero.  In fact, I didn't really get it until I started reading through the first few pages and then I thought...&#34;Geez, seems like she ripped off Finding Joe with this whole Hero's Journey thing.&#34;  Don't you hate it when that happens?<br /><br />The rest of the book is a copy-and-paste job of a bunch of successful people's quotes which I found useful yet annoying at the same time because she puts these quotes amongst her own text, breaking the flow of her own writing.<br /><br />Okay, bottom line...was the book good?  Yes.  In fact, I've ordered it for 2 people I know who are having difficulties in their lives right now.  I felt that the basic message was good and it's inspirational if you're waffling through life, not knowing what your next step should be, and if it's worthwhile to break away from an &#34;average&#34; life to maybe create something &#34;exceptional&#34; for yourself.<br /><br />Will this be your end-all, be-all magic solution to what you're looking for in a self-help book?  Probably not.  The messages are solid and clear reminders of probably a lot of other &#34;you-can-do-it&#34; self-help material out there.  Some of the stuff may be obvious like taking steps toward your dream, even if it's little-by-little, practicing tithing and gratitude everyday.  And it's all a nice reminder in a motivating factor.<br /><br />However, if you want to know the story about Joseph Campbell in a highly motivating medium, get the movie Finding Joe.  You won't be disappointed.  In fact, I like Finding Joe much better than I'll ever like The Secret because there are more things you can actually use to change your life.r />However, if you want to know the story about Joseph Campbell in a highly motivating medium, get the movie Finding Joe.

B00DJYJPLO|1.0|Unbelievable. This is not even worthy of being called a film. This is more or less a very wordy play, as in for the radio. And boring beyond belief.<br /><br />It starts with man and child in airport talking for a long period of time. It was billed at redbox as this really cool love story, so I am suspicious from the get-go.<br /><br /> It moves to same man in car with his wife talking FOREVER. Seriously. We have one camera on them and we listen for at least five minutes as they talk about almost nothing.<br /><br />And then same man with 2 other men sitting on patio talking FOREVER. I am well aware by this point that I have been taken.<br /><br />We have the woman cooking with other women and again, scene is wordy and forever. Dinner...on and on they all talk. Then same man walking with woman talking again FOREVER. Why film it? You can look at the screen once and close your eyes and open them FIVE minutes later to the same people in the exact same spot! Talking.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Since we don't subscribe to cable or some type of regular Tv service (and don't want to), we use our Internet connection to keep up with the weather. It is a LOT faster to use this app on a phone or kindle than it is to use the computer or laptop...plus when you are in the basement waiting out strong winds (aka tornado) it is way more convinient to use (not to mention safer). :)
B00BEIYL6G|2.0|Note: This is NOT the movie based on the brilliant Walter Isaacson biography that came out in 2011 following Jobs' death. That is being adopted by Aaron Sorkin (writer of The Social Network and The West Wing) for some future release.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is one of my personal heroes. I wrote my college essay on him, and I'm a loyal apple fan. So I was surprised when they picked Ashton Kutcher to play Jobs, and more than worried before seeing this film. My worries were confirmed.<br /><br />What we have here is a poorly done, extended made-for-tv movie, that avoids the most interesting parts of Jobs' life (after he returned to apple and his time at Pixar) in exchange for boring boardroom drama with poor dialogue. Josh Gad as Wozniak was ok, as was Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, but neither was spot on. I only hope that Sorkin does this amazing man justice, as JOBS failed miserably.

B00BAXFDLM|4.0|Generally speaking, I loved this Ancillary Justice.  I will admit that I found portions around the half-way mark and perhaps the 3/4 area a little difficult to read, but the final quarter of the book starting bringing everything together for me.  The interview at the end says that this is loosely a trilogy, though I'm not sure how to take that... I really, really cannot wait until the next book!

B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|It does not matter if it is 3940087093 dpi, what you are looking for is the accuracy, which is a function of the hardware: quality of the laser source/sensor and how do you interpret it.. It has to have good dynamics: acceleration, braking etc. Also the contact and the ergonomics is also important. This one often makes extra movements when I stop the motion. Besides, it is a big, asymmetrical mouse.<br /><br />The way to test a high-end mouse is to draw a large &#34;8&#34; in quick circles and to jump from one point to far another. This mouse fails in both, falling way behind of Logitech G3, which is made like 10 years ago. Another way to prove is: I am a good Starcraft 2 player and my rank kept falling with this mouse. I had to revert to G3. I have tried almost every ambitious mouse except Sensei. To give you a rough comparison: G3 &#62; G1 &#62; G7 = Anker. But G7 is a wireless mouse with excellent design, battery and looks.<br /><br />So why in the hell I should keep this Anker? Well it was a birthday gift, so I  guess I have to :( I know you can't find G3, even used, so look for G1 or gamble with Sensei.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Liked this book a lot.  An entertaining reinforcement of  classical mythology. \\"Original\\" and creative characterization.  Looking forward to the next book in the series!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. Great for kids and adults. It gets a little challenging at times which keeps it fun. Lots of quests to complete and different power ups and costumes to buy with your bannanas.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Can't wait to read on there are 2 more books to this set. Loved it! There are a lot of emotions in this read. Very funny at times, sad, romantic. Can't wait to see what the next 2 hold.
1452101426|5.0|Awesome art book, been trying to get this one for a while.  It was still in good condition, pages were mint condition.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the free monthly puzzles.  The app does tend to have a few issues with forced closes but still provides hours of fun and challenges.
006202406X|1.0|I totally enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, and waited with anticipation for Allegiant to come out.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  From the first chapter I didn't like the switch off of persons.  I became totally mixed up.  And the little<br />reminders just confused me more.  I skimmed the last chapter and gave the book (I bought on Amazon) to the local library.<br />No more Veronica Roth for me.  And to have Tris die?  No thanks.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie!  I love the Blue Ray and it's very similar to the book!  Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and I can't wait to see the 2nd one!
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Terrible script.  Wooden acting. If you enjoyed iron man series and avengers this movie will seem like a huge step back in quality.  Don't waste your time.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie being a kid when the original came out many years ago. This movie was a deeper look into the development of Superman the person, loved the character development. Michael Shannon is just an under-rated actor and a great villain is a reason why super hero films are some of the best entertainment out there today.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It felt like I was part of the team throughout the book. The gruesome scenes almost sprang to life and it was almost unbearable to continue reading. As to all good fictions, we will always want to rush to the end but when the end is here, is left wanting more. With this realization hoping the movie will deliver.
B0068TJLSY|1.0|Have you ever actually HEARD something STINK?  Well, this is IT!  Can you hear it? Hahaha!  Save your time and money for a root canal!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Too smallIn didn't like Castleville on my iphone, it was small.  But this is turning out to be a fun game on my Kindle HD.  Just wish I could play it off line.
1476727651|5.0|love Stephen king  think I have everyone of his books  this book is as good as most of his stuff
B00B7Y0206|1.0|My Kindle would not allow this to be installed.  Could be a user error because it works great on my cell phone.
B000067IZ3|5.0|great movie--- played it for people who had never seen it and they loved it! ---- cant go wrong buying this one
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I LOVE THE BACKSTREET BOYS, they have Awesome music. They can Dance, Sing but I don't ever recall ever buying this video here on Amazon but oh well. I enjoy it, and it's so much fun to sing and dance along to. I LOVE YOU, HOWIE D.
B003WGM40S|4.0|I have never read the book and, quite frankly, don't think I would be able to handle it.  I found the acting and the settings and cinemetography to be absolutely wonderful.  The story is just a little too tragic for my liking (even though I do enjoy tragic endings, this just seemed too cruel to me).  I need something that will counter this story and am dumbsrtuck as to what could be the antedote.  Definately worth my time to watch, just wasn't wise to do so in one sitting.
B004529NKC|5.0|This is such a great movie, I enjoy all of the Step Up movies. Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan, Rick Malambri Alyson Stoner, they did such a Great job and I hope that one day I can learn to dance like them.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Overall, the best of the best.  His lyricism in writing is amazing, and his singing transforms any day into a great one.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did an AWESOME job in this movie, Alyson Stoner was so young in this movie but she's a good Actress. The Acting, and the Dancing was Great. And Mario is such a great Actor I would Love to see him in some more movies.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Just finished and can't wait to read the next book about Gabriel allon.  What a talented writer Daniel Silva is  Please Keep writing
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I Love to Dance, too bad I suck at it but I really would LOVE to learn. I Love music and I Love movies I mean, who doesn't? If I could dance and sing as good as these Actors in movies or in real life, I would make a career out of it in a Heartbeat.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so very addicting and fun to play. I just wish we had 10 lives instead of 5 each time!!
B0042KA4VO|5.0|I LOVE THE VMPIRE DIARIES, it is an amazing show, I Love the cast and most importantly I would LOVE to be on the show I think that would be totally AWESOME. I LOVE YOU, STEFAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was the most interesting book on early Ireland I've every read. It was both sweet and endearing and horribly sad at times. A great read.
6305291489|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Lindsay Lohan, she's a great Actress & an Awesome Singer. I don't understand what the hell happened to her but I'm still a huge fan of her, and I hope to hear more of her amazing music very soon.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it is a USB cable... not sure what more to say. It has a nice long cord and it works with my kindle fire, that was amazing was the shipping speed it arrived to me!
B000QXDE6I|5.0|Just Exelent,the best live of the group ,only a litle bit need a few more songs and maybe and extra with Steve Vai as a bonus tracks
B008VO3PA4|4.0|I Read it with my best friend Max the Terror of Tiny Town; yes that's his full name; sitting on my lap.  I read it out loud and he enjoyed it as much as I.  I recommend you enjoy these poems with your best pal all warm and cozy. And then compose a few of your own.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|this album could have been so great, if only Sting had sung it.<br /><br />to be as fair as possible, most of this album sounds a bit like Sting had a head cold when he recorded it. i half expect that they edited out the parts where he was coughing up phlegm. if you were expecting any type of vocal similarity to &#34;Brand New Day&#34; (a multi-Grammy Award-winning album that has gone triple platinum) or anything remotely similar to his work in The Police, or anything that has sold more than  a couple thousand albums, then you should NOT buy this album. whoever was Producing this album should probably have their hands slapped for letting this one pass through. if this was allowed through because he can no longer produce his signature sound, then i feel bad for him, because, at least for me, it was part of his appeal. granted, he is still quite the singer, but it does nothing to make me think &#34;Sting&#34;. if this is how he intends to sing from now on, perhaps it's best he goes back to calling himself &#34;Gordon Sumner&#34;, because this sounds in no way like the Sting people have come to know and love.<br /><br />that being said, this album is not half bad. in fact, several songs move me quite much, and if you can seoparate your expectations of it being &#34;Sting&#34;, it is indeed highly enjoyable as a Christmas album (i know it is touted as a &#34;Wintertime&#34; album, but let's be honest, it IS filed under &#34;Christmas Music&#34;).<br /><br />there are so many unique tracks on this album, several of which were actually written by him, and he uses the voice he has in a way that suits each song (although i still hold that MOST of the tracks would sound better in his signature vocal timbre. i have a similar sounding singing voice, and have tried singing these songs the way i had expected HIM to, and it just sounded better to me). but despite all of that, the album still seems to fall short, because of the one simple fact: Sting's name is on the front, and continues to beckon my expectations of what it &#34;should&#34; sound like.<br /><br />in some songs, it sounds as though he COULD'VE gone much higher, but instead, takes the lower road, seemingly intentionally. there are like, two tracks with a faint glimmer of Sting's sound, but you can tell on the one that there is a second singer that is NOT Sting, backing him, which leads me to believe that he has LOST his voice. but as i said, several of the tracks in this selection are pretty good, ias long as you can suspend what you had expected, and just go with it.<br /><br />the ones i am partial to are &#34;Soul Cake&#34;, &#34;The Snow It Melts The Soonest&#34;, and &#34;Christmas At Sea&#34;. but just try to listen to any of them, and picture what it would sound like &#34;as sung by Sting&#34;, and you will be back in the same caper, wishing for that signature sound again...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This set of books is the best you will ever read! It is brilliantly plotted and they contain an amazing theme!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Because it has Johnny Depp in it and it is really funny. He can be very funny if he chooses and this is one of them. How they do this is fascinating. They showed it on T V. Johnny is the greatest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All  I can say is awesome and addicting game! I can never seem to stop playing this uber awesome game.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. My only complaints were that it wasn't long enough and it took too long for the sequel. Brandon Sanderson is my hero though, so i can forgive him for releasing more amazing books before starting on the next Stormlight Archive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it you get all kinds of mini games and its so fun I love it you will find it is fun
B00DU74U74|1.0|I think giving one star is a little much for this movie.  I should have know, I can't stand the twilight movies, why should this be any better.  I had read the book and thought it was written a little bit better then the twilight book (of which I could only ready one, they are horrid).  I thought maybe that this movie would be a little better since it was her &#34;adult&#34; book.  I was wrong.  Save yourself, and don't watch.  :)
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|If you like angry birds you will love this.and of course it has a Star Wars theme which my grandson enjoyed playing this very much.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Problem is its addicting. Be careful how long you play the game. I was up till 2 last night. Have fun.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|This film created quite a stir when it was first released. I was a teen at the time and wanted to see it desperately but my parents would not let me. I finally saw it years later and was not disappointed. I've seen \\"The Exorcist\\" numerous times now and still enjoy it. The special effects and shock factor may seen mild by today's standards but the fact is it is a very well-made film with excellent acting, production values and music. Ellen Burstyn should have won the Best Actress Oscar for this. The films takes time to develop characters and develop a realistic feel. I think that is why it is so successful.<br /><br />I watched this recently through the Amazon Prime feature and was impressed with the HD quality and streaming. Excellent!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Its a good strategy game for thise that have the time. Its well worth it . I liked it because although its very simalar to most &quot; build your own place&quot; style of gamesit keeps u guessing
1451695195|5.0|\\"Proof of Heaven \\"is a book written about a near-death-experience that all - those who believe in heaven, and those who do not -  will find provocative. What makes this near-death-experience (NDE) story unique and interesting is the Author, Eben Alexander, Md, a highly trained neurosurgeon who spent fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School.<br /><br />Eben, like many trapped by science and the secular culture, was convinced that NDEs were caused by, and based on the natural shutting down of body's physiologic function in death. He repeatedly called God and heaven into question - how these could exist? His scientific world over the years undermined his ability to consider there was something larger.<br /><br />My interest in this subject began in late 1979 when my father shared with me that he had had an NDE while his body was shutting down due to uremic poisoning. My father, a proud man, told me that he had traveled through a dark tunnel towards a bright light when he found his parents standing his way, telling him that \\"he was not ready.\\"<br /><br />Two years later, participation an executive management program at Columbia University introduced me to Roger Blackwell, the top university-based consumer marketing expert in the U.S., who was part of a national task team studying NDEs. He spent nearly three hours sharing his team's observations and findings. I have been an eager student of NDEs ever since.<br /><br />Eben was not prepared for what he personally experienced in late 2008 when his body shut down due to an attack on his brain by E. coli meningitis. His consciousness found itself submerged something like  mud. He had no idea where he was, who he was, or where he came from. He was in a place of pulsing, pounding darkness, and a smell like feces. There was no sense of time. At first, he felt that there was no difference between him and the half-creepy environment that surrounded him.<br /><br />A light then appeared out of the darkness and he heard a living sound - \\"the most beautiful music one could ever hear.\\" The light came closer and found it was not a light but rather something he could see through, an entry to another realm. He then found himself in a completely new world. He felt like he was being born, not reborn.<br /><br />Below him was something that looked like earth but was not. Someone was traveling next to him, a beautiful girl. She gave him a look that exuded love beyond all the different types of love he had ever experienced. It was something higher, and pure. They were flying over trees, fields, streams, waterfalls, and people, people who were laughing. She spoke to him without words in three parts:<br />1. You are loved and cherished by God, dearly, forever.<br />2. You have nothing to fear.<br />3. There is nothing you can do wrong.<br /><br />She added he would see many things, but, eventually, he would go back.<br /><br />He then found himself entering \\"an immense void, completely dark, infinite in size, but also infinitely comforting. He then experienced God, the Creator, the Source, who is responsible for making the universe and all that is in it... While there was no distance between him and God, he could sense the vastness of the Creator and how miniscule he was compared to God... He was told that Evil was necessary because without it free will was impossible, and without free will, there would be no growth, no forward movement, no chance for us to become what God longed for us to be. Love was overwhelmingly dominant in our world and would be ultimately triumphant.\\"<br /><br />He encountered God while in a reality of consciousness completely free of the limitations of his physical brain. He learned that human experience continues beyond the grave and that life is not meaningless. In life and after, human experience falls under the gaze of a God who loves and cares about each one of us.<br /><br />\\"He was taught that only one thing matters - love. Love is the basis of everything. Love is unconditional. Love is the reality of realities, the incomprehensibly glorious truth of truths that lives and breathes at the core of everything that exists or that will ever exist, and no remotely accurate understanding of who and what we are, can be achieved by anyone who does not know it, and embody it in all their actions. This is not just the most important emotional truth but also the most important scientific truth.\\"<br /><br />Eben, \\"I was blind and now I see.\\" He now feels it his duty, his calling, to tell people about what he saw beyond the body and beyond this earth. We must end the big lie, culture's belief in matter as the core reality and that all else - thought, ideas, consciousness, emotions, spirit - were merely productions of it. A big mistake is to believe God does not exist or is impersonal.<br /><br />\\"There is no need to fear the world and build ourselves up through fame or wealth or conquest. Our truest, deepest self is completely free and has no need for the things of the world. We need to get in touch with this miraculous aspect of ourselves. We need to cultivate it and bring it to light. This being is within ourselves and it is the being God intended us to be. How do we get closer to this part of self - manifesting love and compassion?...prayer and meditation.\\"<br /><br />The author learned his beautiful companion was a sister who had died several years earlier, a sister he had never known and had never seen. He recognized her as his guide when another family member shared a picture of her after he returned.<br /><br />This is a very provocative book, one that all should read.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Challenging with nice graphics and many options to choose from. FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY! My boys love this game.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because she somehow managed to keep me reading until the end, but there are so many plot holes it would take me weeks to list them. Plus, the worst ending to a series EVER.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I like the game but the energy is too low, and the upgrades are too expensive. I understand with free game the in game purchases are what makes the company money, but don't make it a necessity to play the game. Make it something I want to do not something I will be forced to do.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A fun way to pass some time. Especially fun for Marvel fans and fans of Iron Man. I recommend this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is by far one of the best I have read recently. My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner.
0312383347|5.0|I just love the characters in the Stephanie Plum series. The &#34;between the numbers&#34; books feature Diesel, and he is quite a character, to say the least. Great book.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|very interesting, I am only into about 10 pages, I take time reading, but this set will keep me busy for a long time
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm a gamer who doesn't do much PC gaming, but when I started to get into it, I noticed my current mouse aggravated my hands tremendously when playing with it for long periods of time. I do have carpal tunnel syndrome, but it's gotten better over the years through physical therapy, but I was really very apprehensive to play anything on PC for at least a year because of my old mouse. Finally I buckled down and decided to get a new mouse. As someone who's never had a gaming mouse, I freaking love this thing.<br /><br />First of all, it's very aesthetically pleasing to look at. It glides very smoothly along the new mousepad that I also purchased ( a SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad - [[ASIN:B000UEZ36W B000UEZ36W]] ), comes with weights, though I don't feel a need for them, has plenty of extra buttons to program, not that I need too many but the option is nice, and features a button that changes your mouse speed without having to go into the computer's Control Panel. This is very helpful in situations where a game may make your mouse speed slower than normal, or you need a faster or slower speed for any reason. Note that it does not allow you to go back in forth with speed, it goes through its four settings of low to high, then resets after the fourth, highest speed.<br /><br />In addition, the software for it (that you download for free from their website) allows you to configure your buttons, change the color of the glowing Anker symbol to any that you wish, adjust DPI, and set macros, and is not necessary to still use the mouse.<br /><br />Now in regards to my Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, let me say that this mouse is very ergonomic for me. My hands are not large (they are a Medium in men's gloves), so I'm unsure if larger or smaller hands would be affected differently. I have been able to play games like League of Legends and Space Station 13 for hours on end without much, if any, pain. I'm not saying that no pain is present, but it certainly alleviates a lot of the painI would get from playing for even an hour with my old mouse. I do not feel apprehensive about playing PC games any longer in regards to my hand. My tailbone on the other hand... Well, that's a different story.<br /><br />I do have two minor complaints, though they are far too small to lower the rating. The first is that the cord, made of some type of cloth (I think teflon?) vs. the standard rubber, makes noise when I'm moving my mouse backwards as it scrapes against the end of my desk. This can be slightly annoying, but it doesn't bother me that much. The only other complaint I have is that the mouse itself is very bright, and only dims or shuts the lights off when the computer is off or the mouse is unplugged, and since there's no way to adjust the intensity of the lights, it can lead to problems at night for those who cannot stand things like night lights. Since this is our living room computer, this is not too much of a problem, since nobody sleeps there, but it should be noted.<br /><br />Overall I'd recommend this mouse to anyone who's fine with a corded mouse that's good for gaming. It looks nice, feels nice, and the company has contacted me several times asking for my input on the matter, which shows me a company that cares about its product. I have finally decided to oblige the folks at Anker with this review, and hope they will continue to improve in the gaming mouse market.
B00E9A656K|4.0|Love this... but comments about the waiting for GAS bling true.  1st purchase for gold coins to circumvent... will cost $9.99.  Way up from there!  A LOT of waiting... each event loads slowly and requires manic button pushing on my fire.  BTW... almost bought some gold.  I want to keep this game.  Wanted to rate a 5 Star.  Frustration level a little High however.
B000002C4J|5.0|Excellent condition!! I'd listened to my original for so long it was dying. Thank you so much for having it in great shape for such a reasonable price!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very interesting book.  MUCH MUCH better than the movie. Dont let the movie disuade you from reading it.<br />It does not have a linear story line and instead is more of a collection of short stories.
0375826726|3.0|Well their were so many events that took place that really frustrated me. It seemed like most of the book saphira and her rider were apart. The dwarf politics were daunting to say the least. What happened to Glade and his rider and what happened to Roran. I have book four laying on my bedside but I have to take a break from it and hope the last book is fulfilling.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I must admit this was the best of King I have seen in a long time. I have been an avid fan since junior high but, I had been deeply disappointed in his recent novels within the last several years. The biggest disappointment had been the last book in the Dark Tower series, needless to say I took a Stephen King sabbatical. This book was the old King I remember.
B00C6MYITO|5.0|I read quite a lot and must say the Pollyanna books are the best I've read in a long time. Will read them again and again. I expected a child's story but was mistaken. This fiction is for all ages. Such a pure story.
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|I am a total technophobe! and it has taken me 4 months to pluck up the courage to try this, but I found it great and loved the fact that I did'nt need to use my specs! the screan is big and clear,and the quality was good.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|is to much violence for me, to realistic. I don't like kill even an ant less the beautiful animal than you guys present in this game. is a beautiful  exposition of a naturalist a can tell that. if someone fill tempt to critics me, go head. I don't know English and I try to make me understanding
0143116177|2.0|A very tiresome read! There are more interesting books to take to bed.  Mr. Ferguson needs to read something beside economics stuff!
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Ryan Gosling is not a charismatic actor, but with good direction he can be a very cool actor, as the thriller &#34;Drive&#34; demonstrates.  Gosling will probably be defined by his role in &#34;Drive,&#34; a moody but subdued vehicle that rides gently and slowly before speeding out of control.  Carey Mulligan is luminous in this film, and Albert Brooks is terrifying in his calculating persona.  The plot may be gibberish, but the direction is very good, and in &#34;Drive&#34; we have a highly stylized and atmospheric thriller.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|The best game you could have on your kindle fire. Animation, voice acting, sound, strategy and level design are superior to any other TD game on the market. The enemy variety, tower variety, number of levels, and fun to be had is all top notch. Difficulty setting are adjustable for the novice to the advanced tactician. Can't recommend it enough. Easily worth every penny
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Really impressive look at the overarching problems of controlling the US nuclear arsenal during the Cold War and to awful realities of a single accident for the people involved. Amazing anecdotes about the people who lived with weapons day in day out, and scary lessons about institutional momentum and capture.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I felt like I was part of the story. The emotions were running high throughout the book.  The mixture of suspense and intrigue was worth the read.  I was on the edge of my seat until the end.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Incredibly profound case for life after death. Read with an open mind. For me , I found it very comforting to get a sneak peek at what we will all experience eventually.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I LOVE THIS KNIFE. Big beefy blade that will stand up to a lot of unconventional punishment. Blade, glass breaker, pry bar. It's small enough to meet local law requirements, yet beef enough to be impressive.
B00FJ30OD6|5.0|SCANDAL-JUST OK<br />THE GOOD WIFE--FANTASTIC<br /><br />I am so frustrated by those tv folk who rave every week about Scandal; don't these people ever watch The Good Wife. In my opinion (sound familiar) this show is far and above anything on television. I watch it on my Kindle Fire so I can go back and remind myself what happened the week before making it an even greater experience.<br />All the stars, all the plot lines, the court scenes  remind me a bit of Perry Mason--always pulling something out of a hat. The judges are a hoot; the whole cast is awesome and the writing is top notch.<br />I won't go into all the 'who's and what's' - I think I covered that in one of my other reviews of this show but suffice it to say this is one spectacular hour(s) and if you haven't seen it catch up; I guarantee you'll love it and put Scandal down one notch on the ladder of greatness and The Good Wife at the top!!!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|The Doctor's at their finest!!!! Matt Smith & David Tennant together at last, and unbeiliablely themselves. Funny, rich, and an in depth look at the time war at its finest.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|The What to expect when you're expecting movie was a letdown.  Not a great movie at all.  Wish I hadn't watched it.  Thx
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Such an awesome game. You have to have a Kindle to play it, as the game has not been released for all of Android. I have wanted to play it for forever, but it has only been out for the ipad and phone.
0744014956|5.0|This book has been very helpful and I am so glad I bought it, it's a perfect compliment to the game.
B001AFF25W|5.0|It is simple, it is precise, it is very graphic, it is really applicable. Changes your day to day, changes your life.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a truly amazing book.  I bought it because I saw the preview for the movie (I know books are always better than movies).  It did not disappoint me at all.  Such a great book with a good plot and character development.
B0018LMZOO|3.0|Unlike their previous six albums, this recording is in a mostly blase funk until the rousing closer I'm Just A Singer In A Rock 'n' Roll Band. Isn't Life Strange sounds like a mediocre Bee Gees song.<br />For prime Moodies, check out Lost Chord, Threshold and Childrens Children.
B00103584Y|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and excitingly gripping movie I know. I watch it over and over enthusiastically.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the game can be frustratingly difficult at times, especially on the timed levels. A good tutorial wouldn't. hurt either.<br /><br />over all it is a fun game
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I adore these tiny yellow hooligans I just wish the game wasn't so stingy with the gold. The best minions are out of reach. We can't save gold and be forced to spend it on goals or to go to different levels. I could see using a fee once to unlock a level but every time. I used to be addicted but now I feel I am going in circles with no pay off.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The product works very well. i wish there were more options for choosing movies but maybe that will come in the future.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Big fan of the Pendergast novels and White Fire is another wonderful entry.  It is also a nice place for  someone new to the Pendergast novels to start.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|I'm an adult, but a child at heart, and hardly could wait for the story to start!<br />From beginning to end, on the edge of my seat, would the children feel better and the 'gators defeat?!<br /><br />A delightful story with lively illustrations!  I highly recommend it for readers of all ages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Challenging but not too difficult, makes you think a little. I wish there was way more levels. It didn't take to long to complete. Please update soon!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works great. Price is right and convenient. I have a number of &#34;older&#34; chargers and this makes them all usable.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Great series if you like bookies opens up your eyes not surd how true to life these are but definitely entertaining to day the least not suitable for children
B00BATG18K|2.0|As an admirer of Amy Tan—and a Sinophile—I bought a hardcover copy of her new book, The Valley of Amazement, which I expected to love. Sadly, I must report it to be a total disappointment. For the sake of old times, I slogged through all 589 pages, unengaged in the characters or the drawn out story, and wishing with all my heart for a good editor. I now know more about courtesan houses in old Shanghai than I ever cared to. Some of this overlong part of the story was heartrending; most of it, however, was unpleasant and often so unnecessarily graphic that it called to mind Fifty Shades of Gray. And I’m not a prude. I found none of the characters appealing, and the repetition of the loss of a daughter by two generations of mothers bored me. I cannot recommend anything about this book.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I love this series and is worth every star the actors are fantastic and the storylines brilliant keep you guessing all the time
B00G4EXNNM|4.0|Sounds good though a bit repetitive. Follows the American folk tradition with guitar and piano. I was surprised by the previous reviewer's comments. Norah Jones is not playing the sitar and there is nothing &#34;Indian' in this album. Nothing 'punk' about this too.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Purchased this digital music during an Amazon promotion and can't beat the price for this Lady Gaga collection of music.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I bought this device to convert my father's slides (1954-1998); estimated at 4,000 slides.  I am half way through and I am pleased with it.  You have to blow it clean every once in a while, since the cardboard slides create dust and could end up as specks on your jpeg files.  It's pretty easy to use, and the price is right.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to save money by doing all the work themselves rather than sending their slides out to a service.  Also, I was a little worried about losing the slides if I mailed them, since they are irreplaceable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice little game of ten levels. Challenging but not frustatingly hard. Completed in about an hour. I'm looking forward to new levels.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|This was a very disappointing product. Gaga has gone to a place I don't understand any more. I loved her prior releases but this is simply out there. I have heard that she has fallen in love with herself, and perhaps that has led her astray.
B004AUFVU0|5.0|This was entertaining from beginning to end; great story of a man who has gotten himself in the position of letting supervisors use him to bring their girlfriends to his city apartment with promises of advancement in the company.  There are twists and turns throughout that finally force Jack Lemmon into a tough decision.  Shirley MacClaine is beautiful and Fred McMurray outstanding in this very fun romp!
B00138D2XA|4.0|After many listens to both albums, I found that the Verlaine produced tracks on disc one of \\"Sketches\\" had more staying power than Grace.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Grace, but for me it was a little over-produced.  I like the paired down sound on disc one.  Jeff chose Tom Verlaine to produce the album, over Columbia's objections, because he wanted a grittier sound than was on Grace. Verlaine considered these finished tracks, even if Jeff did not.  This was the album that was going to be released before Jeff had second thoughts, and may have scrapped the whole thing had he lived, which would have been a shame.  I like the variety of sound on disc 1.  Much of it is a hard driving sound, more in the rock vein than Grace,  but the more tender Everybody Here Wants You and Opened Once are also masterpieces.  Also they are all originals except for Yard of Blonde Girls, which blends in perfectly.<br /><br />Disc 2 is a different story.  I have no use for most of disc 2, with the exception of the tracks repeated from disc 1 and Jewel Box and Satisfied Mind (an old live recording) which are both very stripped down and unproduced.  Back in NYC is interesting, but not something I would listen to often.  Most of the rest of disc 2 is hard to listen to and sounds like Jeff messing around by himself when he was in an agitated state.<br /><br />I would give disc one 5 stars, but deducted a star for disc 2, which feels like an attempt to make more money by charging for a 2 CD set.  I am surprised that My Sweetheart the Drunk has received so little positive attention.  Disc 1 is the album, and a damn fine one in my opinion.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|We had originally seen it on tv, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is an exceptionally beautiful dvd of Celtic Woman.  We had to have a copy of it for our forever use.  We are fans of Celtic Woman, and love hearing their beautiful voices!!
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Her best release to date!  &#34;Undercover&#34; is simply amazing and I can't stop listening to it over and over again!
B0081336FO|5.0|Really well done show with likeable characters.  Long episodes, so each one is like a movie.  Very fun show to watch
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I couldn't 'shut it down' on Kindle (iPad). Grisham at his best, parodying small town politics and big time lawyers who are only full of themselves, never wisdom nor concern for justice or the US system.
B00BEMTP6I|3.0|Like people have been saying, the CD packaging appears homemade. The bottom of the CD looks like a cheap CD-R and the sleeve doesn't have any lyrics in it. (Atypical of John Frusciante albums) Tracks 4 and 5 are also listed out of order. Upon close inspection, it clearly says that it is manufactured by Amazon LLC. I know they can do a better job than this--- At least get the track listing correct!  The bottom of my CD also had a scratch on it right out of the package. With that being said, it doesn't appear to affect the playability of the CD. And as far as I can tell, the music is still CD quality. The album itself is phenomenal. One of the best I've ever listened to. But Amazon LLC needs to acquire originals or get their stuff together!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|OK I just do not have the time to use it so have not played in a while but when I do use it, works great.
B000093FLA|5.0|I don't care how old this movie is, it's so classic! Guy Ritchie is brilliant and Brad Pitt just makes this movie that much more awesome because you can't really understand anything Mickey says! &#34;It's for me ma&#34;....
B00CG5MVD6|4.0|Classic Depp, a must see for the lovers of his quirky characters. Showed this to the kids and they enjoyed it too.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I spent more for the digital copy. It was very easy to transfer to my Google Play account, and view on my Android device.  Now I just need for my daughter to enjoy it the way I did when I was younger...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King does it again! I honestly could not put this one down. Full of suspense and enough creepy fiction to make it a classic Stephen King novel.  It's definitely worth the read!
B00EDY5KTA|5.0|When it comes to Disney features, the music can make or break the movie. Many fans turned away entirely from Hercules because of the unexpected musical choices with the Gospel-style songs (although I am personally a fan), and to this day, I think that if Disney had made the music integrated into Tarzan the way they did the Broadway version, it would have ended up being a much bigger hit.<br /><br />Well, Frozen is an absolute win in the musical category, and if you’re a fan of Broadway, then you will be very, very pleased.<br /><br />The orchestral score from Christophe Beck is quite, quite lovely, and pulls you strongly in to the film right from the beginning. But as solid as the score is, the actual songs are where Frozen soars.<br /><br />“Frozen Heart” starts the film off strong with a solid, sea-chanty-esque rhthym, “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” establishes the relationship between the sisters and is heart-breakingly sweet and sad at the same time. “Reindeers Are Better Than People” is a cute little ditty featuring Jonathan Groff, and “Fixer Upper” is fun and energetic and will make great background music when walking through the Disney parks.<br /><br />But there are three songs that everyone will be talking about.<br /><br />“For the First Time in Forever” (and its reprise) is the adult counter-point to “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” and is absolutely essential to understanding who both Anna and Elsa are. It has a great build throughout, catchy lyrics, and really fun visuals. Think of it in the same vein as other Disney &#34;I Want&#34; Songs, and you won’t be far off at all.<br /><br />“Love is an Open Door” is a really lovely love-song duet, and in a different film, could easily be the one that everyone will remember at the movie’s end. The opening and closing of doors is a recurring theme in Frozen, and when the song plays, it is easy to see how Anna can be swept away by her handsome prince.<br /><br />Incidentally, although we’re past the point where this should be surprising, Kristin Bell has quite a lovely singing voice, and she’s really fun to listen to throughout.<br /><br />But the breakout hit song of Frozen is, without question, “Let it Go.”<br /><br />Anyone familiar with Idina Menzel’s career knows this, but that woman has an amazing voice, with a tone very unlike many others. She isn’t always technically perfect, but she is incredibly talented, and the imperfections in her voice are what allow it to bring so much emotion to what she sings. If you only know her from watching Glee, than this may surprise you. If you’re familiar with her from Rent, then you know she has the pipes, but you may not be prepared for her ability to reach in to your heart and twist. If you know Menzel from listening to Wicked, then you know what I’m talking about.<br /><br />I was introduced to Idina Menzel’s singing when she performed “Defying Gravity” at the 2004 Tony Awards, and fell in love, rushing out to purchase the soundtrack. Although I love the entire show, “Defying Gravity” was my favorite feminine power ballad of all time, and remains a regular on my iPod.<br /><br />“Let It Go” is better.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Great program! Very much enjoyed it. If you are a Doctor Who fan you will absolutely love seeing....well... the show. I can't say too much as it may give away a thing or two about the movie (which was a fun time).<br /><br />Not sure why people are so concerned about the tiny price tag. &#34;it's 2.99, or 3.99, or 7.99&#34;...who cares? I would have bought it for 14.97.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Makes  reading a document super easy. You can highlight or leave a note on anything! I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great way to keep track of battery life. I like the visual nature of the app. It works really well and stops me running out before I finish what I'm doing : )
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown overcame much. He showed the selfless service to all he came in contact with.<br />He gave God and Country 110%
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A group of us read this and all loved it.  We were still talking about it a month later.  Well written, really interesting story line.  Certainly does make you ask yourself, &#34;Do you REALLY want to know?  Is your life better or worse than it was before you knew?&#34;
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|So funny that I didn't want it to end. I can't wait to recommend her to my friends. Am going to search for her blog immediately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad this is finally available for kindle. I have tried to stay away for as long as possible and I finally caved.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My daughter and I love playing it together. I even sneak a few minutes after she goes to bed. Graphics are beautiful and it is easy to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm 10 and subway surfer is the best game I've ever played it keeps me busy and is available for all ppl kids and adults. My brother and i challenge each other to see who stays running longer. AMAZING THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS AMAZING = )
B000W93CHC|5.0|I loved Pillars of The Earth and this book is just as good or better.  Well written, unpredictable and engaging.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Genova gives the reader a compassionate and humorous look into the world of a family affected by Alzheimer's. It's a must read.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|A very good book-to-movie conversion.  All of the emotional parts of the book are here, some of the sub plot is missing, but nothing you will miss in the roller coaster ride that is this movie.
0307454541|5.0|Intriguing, smart, fast paced with lots of twists and turns you don't see coming...just the kind of book I'd been looking for.  Great read!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|The game is a lot like the PC game, but with one exception. I don't think this can be helped, but there is a way with the touch screen that can cause misfiring. Makes me crazy
1416563156|4.0|This is a great book, if you're a fan. It's especially fun to read when you're watching the movie. Have kids? They'll LOVE this! It's a fantastic, fun 'in world' companion to the film. I do wish it had a bit more information, or delved deeper in. I'd have really liked to have taken some of the information to a new level - additional background on things that weren't in the movie, or some secret character development - but that 'wish list' doesn't detract from the fun! The book is well made, the cover is lovely, and the content great
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is an excellent book, like all of his efforts.  It did not scare me as badly as did &#34;The Shining&#34;, but is still gripped your attention, and kept you going until the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me wondering what was going to happen. Well done all the way to the last word. Can't wait for the last book.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was the perfect ending to this series. I understand that many of the reviews here are upset with how the ending was resolved, but it was the almost the only natural way this could end. Any other ending would have been forced and fake.<br /><br />Veronica Roth took the leap and wrote exactly what the story needed and asked for. She understand her characters through and through, and how each character's emotional journey would evolve. And she knew that the world they lived in was broken, and the only way to save it was through sacrifice. As with all great books, victory must be achieved but at great cost. (Think Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc)<br /><br />Read it.
B004NGYXIM|5.0|Just as described, Works the way it should. great shipping time and good tracking. overall happy with this product, would recommend.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|There is no waiting for energy to rebuild, gameplay is constant, absolutely wonderful!<br />I play everyday, especially at night while I wait for my daughter to wake up for late night bottle!
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Just as described, Works the way it should. great shipping time and good tracking. overall happy with this product, would recommend.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like it. It is a very good game with very good graphics. I would recommend it to my friends.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|The Lean Startup Eric Ries<br /><br />Great for entrepreneurs and those who want to be. A different perspective in building a company
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Took a trip and never left the farm.  Fantastic journeys.  Great characters and story lines, with awesome space scenes and settings.  I've already watched it over and over.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally I can play the game my iphone friends have been playing for months!  Lots of fun, even when it's frustrating.
B00EH0K9H8|1.0|So disappointed.  ordered in advance.  Great cd, great band, no picture or sound on the Blu Ray in any of my Blu Ray machines.  I don't know what happened, but I returned it, full refund, but I want to see and hear this show.  Someone fix this and let us know it is safe for Blu Ray DVD in the US.  When it is fixed, it will be great!!!!
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This was an ok film, just not what I expected from a Denzel film, I guess I am so use to his action roles. it was ok.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Great show, great musicians, with perfect crowd and performance.  New drummer shows his stuff.  Yes he can carry this music and work in this mix of the truly greatest musicians of our time.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|this was not at all a good film it came across a bit rushed and eagered to pleased with cheesy scenes and boring action scenes.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Realistic, fun, in depth game. Long enough to play for hours and not get bored, better graphics the the cabalas hunting game for Xbox 360!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game turned out to be more fun than I expected.  Easy enough too. So far it has been fun and challenging enough.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun my son and I play every day and have a blast seeing who can run the farthest between us. I hope to keep playing especially the updated versions.
B0055S348W|5.0|This app does everything we wanted it to do.it was easy to install and is easy to understand how to use.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Helps pass the time. Enjoy it. Never any problems with the game working. Play it on my kindle all the time.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The ending more than justified this harrowing story of love and dismay within a seemingly normal family. It was a compelling read, well paced and carefully plotted. The subject matter, though disturbing, gave me much to think about.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Good read. Will definitely run u thru the gamut of all emotions. Still crying as I type. U should read it.
B008220C38|4.0|somehow I expected a better rendition of this morbid story as opposed to the first anna...but it did not come across.  the stars were okay but not exceptional.
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|Its a lovely book I liked it because it has many situations that most married women can relate to and its a book to have a different perspective on problem solving.
B001C4AFOY|3.0|to some this film might be the greatest...but it was quite a bit boring.  I will keep it but am not sure how often I will rescreen it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's a very simple and relatively cheap product. I've bought one just to try out and I was surprised at how easy it is to set it up and have it running. It is true there are only a few apps that can be used with Chromecast, but it works with Netflix and Youtube, so if you use those, this item is for you. I believe more apps are probably going to support it if its sales rise. But nonetheless it is a very good replacement for the more expensive Apple TV (which I also own), if you target Netflix. And it presents no difficulties to be controlled by your smartphone or tablet (including IOS devices). Its size is also well thought, as you can hide it behind your TV and no one will ever notice you have it there. That's it: simple, easy and affordable.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|this story will never die!!  it just goes on  and on and keeps getting better and better.  here is another classic in story and film form.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|An outstanding book for couples. It is Important for every relationship in your life. An essential for every home library.
B006FE83UE|5.0|this film is worthy of all its plaudits over the years.  Gregory peck is marvelous.  the story packs a thunderous theme.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Great mind-bending flick. Keeps you on your mental toes throughout the entire movie. Story, music, acting and effects all come together to deliver a full package of entertainment.
B0007939NO|5.0|great story, great stars, beautiful music, interesting dancing, marvelous sets. what more could you ask for?  it's a musical that will last.
B002PE0HCU|5.0|One of the best movies from the Master of Suspense. It still works today; even my 14-year-old son was apprehensive as Melanie Daniels walked slowly up the stairs (&#34;She's crazy!&#34;).
B005EJNAK4|3.0|It's more violent than necessary but an interesting theme.  Not for young kids of course but my interest held through the whole story.
0451232852|4.0|Great book.....Follett never disappoints.  I always learn something from his amazing research and detail.  Almost as good as Pillars of the Earth.... : )
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I got this for my 3 year old daughters Nabi2, I started with the free version, but quickly decided to buy it. it is super cute she cooks her customers meals and this app has other games like cleaning up, setting the table, washing dishes ect. I love playing it with her.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|The story was predictable but I enjoyed seeing the relationship develop.  It is a quick read.  It made me laugh and cry so I consider it worth reading.  I can see how it's ending would upset people but until you are in that place how do you know what you would feel.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|To me this CD is Acoustic poetry.  It's nice to hear lyrics that have a meaning.  The messages to each song are quite timely.... enough Musical Genocide!
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|For those who are having problems with gangstar Vegas and internal storage this is for you. Download es file explorer and go in to your sd storage. It will show you everything stopped in your sd. Delete troublesome games or terrible games or music or videos from there. Besides being a convenient way to clear your storage, it also enables you to change pictures of apps. Sup if your mom knows about gangstar Vegas change the title of the app and picture.<br /><br />Once you get to play this fantastic game you can thank me. I love this game
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Well i think its cool and all but it really does get older and older but its cool at first but i think they should add: a campaing,so you can make coustum suits,levels,open-world (like minecraft) and better powerups<br />I really hope the creators read this i really want updates cool updates<br />Buy i really recommend this game is great
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I necessarily like my opinion. I LOVE IT! If you bored get this game to experience action and actually load and operate the.weaphones.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|I am not sure if its my tv but the audio on this movie was all over the place. It was quiet in some areas and loud in others. Please tell me it wasn't the movie and it was my tv. Still good movie though.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I love the way that he looks into people's backgrounds and stories. There are so many details that play into who we are than we think.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cool. I got this and can't put it down. My mom couldn't figure it out at first so she let me try.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|Simply amazing! Great characters! Sweet love story and great way to show that love can concure it all! Read it you will love it!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very good for spending time. One minute your waiting the next your late. Very fun too. I highly recommend this game to anyone. Plays great on my kindle fire.
B007I2BYX0|5.0|My only complaint is, Give me more! This band always leaves me wanting more...the two live cuts are worthy inclusions, and I can't wait for the new album.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I really enjoy this game,it can be easy or hard as you want it. If you like to play solitaire games,you will like this one.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great book, loved the twists. Read this book in 2 days. I recommend this book if u enjoy this type of stories.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The middle rooms were the hardest, but very enjoyable. I needed to find helps but only after I had tried everything I could. I would recommend this to others.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best.  From the beginning, I've been unable to stop reading.  A friend and I have both been reading the book, and we both agree that it's a GREAT read.  We both really liked the Clanton setting and some of the previous characters as well as the twists and turns.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have had this game for over a year now and have found myself playing it everyday since June of this year. The only real complaints I have with this game are the high costs in gems like everypony else has mentioned before, and the wait times for some of the shops. However I understand that GameLoft needs the money to develop more content for the game and that is very reasonable in my opinion. I can't wait to see more from GameLoft for this game!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It took me a couple chapters to get into Night Circus because there are so many characters and the chapters jump back and forth over years of events, but once I made it through the first few chapters I was lost in my imagination. Erin Morgenstern is a gifted author whose writing opened my mind to possibilities otherwise unimagined. Loved the plot and the twists and turns along the way. Often times I am able the predict the outcome of the book ahead of time, but with this book I was unable to determine the conclusion until the very end. I am also not typically interested in anything &#34;circus&#34;, but I was drawn into the ingenious black and white world of the Night Circus. Overall a beautiful read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. But, some of the levels are really hard to beat but, it's worth playing. Thank  for getting me hooked.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Classic and enjoyable, rushing her endings in last few, still good and this is back to reliable scarpetta drama. Quick read
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I liked the first castleville by I like this one better and I can even play when I am offline which is pretty cool I like the quest the are fun as well
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The twists and turns of this plot are ingenious as well as the poetic justice meted out at the end..
B009O2XY12|2.0|I chose this rate because it isn't really fun because if u die on one level then u can't play again
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Been watching this master piece on the reg since childhood.<br />One of my favorites, I watch it over and over and have it playing in the background simply to listen to it.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I personally hate  games that have to be logged on to Facebook to get through the  levels this is one of those types of games. To me its  not fair we have  to give them access to our privacy to be successful, I guess the ideal is really being pounded in our heads. The game it's self honestly wasnt good enough for giving  it access to Facebook. After about  three seconds your storage is to small and game play stops. It's not nice
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Repeated finding of the same objects in the same pictures gets old fast.  ok for a free game, seems to be easy to play without spending on extras.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!!!!!  U need this app it is awesome and finally it is on the kindle Appstore!! I've been waiting!!
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|It's a great re-telling of the story. No spoilers but the format of the story done in flashbacks was pretty cool.
1476729085|4.0|Geneticist Don Tillman is clueless in social situations, but it would be unfair to say he has no friends. He lays claim to TWO friends, as a matter of fact, his colleague Gene and Gene’s wife Claudia. But he’s never had a second date, and he decides to rectify his lack of success in opposite-sex relationships by embarking on The Wife Project, an attempt to find the perfect partner by using a 16-page questionnaire he designs to weed out smokers, vegetarians, and other unacceptable candidates. Rosie Jarman is a smoking, vegetarian part-time bartender who asks Don for help in locating her biological father. Rosie is the antithesis of Don’s “perfect partner”, so we KNOW what is going to happen! The witty depiction of their quests is marvelous entertainment, even when the outcome is never in doubt.<br />Certainly Don is an extreme personality, but Simsion manages to bring him to life, and I enjoyed getting to know him. Despite his awkwardness with other people, he does not totally lack feelings for others. I especially liked his friendship with the elderly Daphne, whom he talks to about genetics and whose birthdays he celebrates by bringing her a daphne flower, just as her late husband did. Don might commit faux pas, but he is hard not to like.  Heck! I might even have gone out with him a second time!<br />There is one implausibility in The Rosie Project that the reader is just going to have to overlook. Don is a trained geneticist who is familiar with the autistic spectrum and Asperger’s. Although his own expertise is in the science behind the syndrome, he knows the behavioral manifestations. In addition, he had psychiatric evaluation when he was young and was diagnosed with depression and OCD but not as being in any way autistic. It is hard to believe that the realizations he comes to about himself by the end of the book did not occur much earlier, especially given his predilection for evidence-based reasoning. However, the book was light enough and the writing skillful enough that my own rational brain was willing to go on hold and just let the emotional part enjoy itself.<br />I was not surprised to read that The Rosie Project has already been optioned for a film.  The snappy dialogue and vivid images are sure to make it a hit!<br />A final caution: Do not judge this book by its opening. When I  read the scene scene in the Kindle sample, I felt it was a bit heavy-handed almost to the point of disrespect for the “Aspies”. I decided to give it another chance after reading some positive reviews from people who know the autism spectrum.  As I got into it further, it was clear that the portrait was much more sympathetic than I thought it would be.ting skillful enough that my own rational brain was willing to go on hold and just let the emotional part enjoy itself.<br />I was not surprised to read that The Rosie Project has already been optioned for a film.

B00AB7HESI|2.0|I love the game i played it on DS. However on my SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 it will not play properly. It keeps on shutting down and you have to reopen app and it doesn't save when it force closes. Please patch this!!!
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Acting and scripting were very good, especially acting by Julie Delpy.  Realistic in its treatment of topic.  l liked it better than Before Sunrise.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Movie was a bit long and acting was just so so.  The story line was also a bit weak.  If you can get it on sale, I might recommend it.
B001NA6096|3.0|Had difficulty suspending disbelief that a very intelligent young woman would get off her train with a total stranger who appeared to be less educated and less motivated than she and who claimed to be just bumming across Europe without any apparent means of income or destination.  Maybe because I didn't find Ethan Hawke's character compelling or interesting.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Seriously.You can do better.This game annoys me.In the game,why can't we decide  what stuff we want to sell instead of that lady who mostly just asks for apples.But I have to admit,the characters are very cool looking...
B00CBKVMG8|1.0|Jump around,jump around, actors acting as tuff guys, one guy is so cool he can flip his Zippo,wow, at least the people working on these get paid to take care of their family's, the only good thing .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game.Amazing graphics.I recommend this game for anyone.I'm so glad that it was free.I just don't like that on kindle 's the upgrades are behind...
B00DXP7L88|5.0|To wrap up the story in twelve episodes or chapters, that’s short, that’s fast, but that’s radical, &agrave; la Dexter. He manages to solve a ton of problems in these twelve episodes.<br /><br />First he finds a surrogate mother for Harrison, and that was difficult to find. Luckily the only woman he had loved and that was still alive, apart from his sister turns up and re-activates some fundamental mechanisms. And Harrison likes her. She is very special but she wants to become a good girl.<br /><br />He manages to solve the problem of his father and how his father, a good cop, could accept his adoptive son to become a criminal, how he managed to come up with the code, etc. In fact the symbolical mother surrogate of his, of Dexter, comes up to him and reveals who she is and what she did. She reveals that his father OD’ed on his heart drug when he could not stand what Dexter had become any more. Dexter hates that doctor Vogel that has nothing of a bird in that story, at most a vulture but that is no  bird you try to attract in your garden with a bird feed and a bird bath.<br /><br />He has to solve a last case of a serial killer who is aiming at both him and Doctor Vogel. Her past is revealed and she becomes extremely dark and deep with one son killed by another, you know the story of Cain and Abel. And the killing son is sent East of Eden in some institution in England, or something far to the East. And there he is tortured into medical blankness since he is a criminal who deserves to be punished even if it is with drugs or some archaic violent treatment like electric shocks or other forceful manipulations of the body or the brain, and why not the mind and the imagination.<br /><br />Of course the dear son who was buried alive in this institution plans a good case of arson, with seven dead people in the wing that burns, and himself among these seven, officially, because’ in fact he manages to get out, change identities and then move on, looking for mummy, Doctor Vogel, and all those she preferred to him, and first of all Dexter. And the blood trail can start under the police identity of the “brain surgeon” because he saws up the skull of his victim in a very special way and scoops out one very precise section of the brain and delivers these extracted sections to his mummy. A yummy appetizer for Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving celebrations.<br /><br />He of course has to save his sister from private investigation and then to make her a star in the Police Department. So he finally comes over his need to kill with his last victim and gives him over to Deborah for her to arrest him. But a Federal Marshall comes up and he completely messes the case, frees the criminal who kills him straight away, takes his gun, shoots Deborah who shoots him but in vain. And things will not turn honky dory and there will be some complications. Dexter then has to close up the file and clean up the plate. Deborah disappears in a hurricane.<br /><br />Finally he has to take care of himself and to protect Harrison and the substitute mother who has taken the boy to South America, and there is only one way. So he disappears with his boat into the hurricane. A tempestuous ending but it works.<br /><br />And yet they more or less kept one card up their sleeves, I mean the producers, for a sequel in let’s say five or ten years, when Harrison reaches teenage and starts moving towards finding his father and recuperating the father model he needs and remembers from his tumultuous first four years. Check amm by yourselves with the DVDs how they manage to keep one bun in the oven in slow gestation.<br /><br />You can always dream. But it is sure the author of the book series will be able to go on working with Dexter if he wants, though the last volume was announced a long time ago and will maybe finally come out next March (2014) and it is supposed to be entitled Dexter’s Final Cut, which promises quite some blood.<br /><br />We’ll see. Que sera sera. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? What will be, will be!<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUa. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? What will be, will be!<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00CUKTGW6|4.0|A nice little set. I think separating LC into two discs, and Sandi in three was a little bit petty: these are CD's, not analog remastered albums.
1476729085|5.0|I loved this book. It is so funny. A contemporary love story that had me laughing out loud. If you want a break from the over-erotic, the incredibly wealthy, and the too beautiful, read this. It is about ordinary people who have learned to cope in the world but still have questions about life and think there could be something special out there for them. It should give hope to anyone who has a friend with mild autism or OCD. Will that person be okay alone in the big wide world? According to the author, yes. And having a darn good time. Of course, they do not have to be alone. The style, from the man's point of view reflecting on his considered opinions, reminded me of Major Pettigrew's Last Stand.
B00F031WKE|5.0|Great for this to be released. The vinyls were flat (not the sound, the actual disc), but i had two pieces of white sticky 'dust' that i had to use record cleaner on, they were causing sticking.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Loved this episode!  I am from Texas, so when Sheldon's mom comes to visit, it's always a hoot with her Texas references - we all identify with what she does and says.  Love this show!
B00CL68BK2|4.0|The acting was well done; the story unique and it kept my attention. Worth watching for sure. Jennifer Lawrence is compelling to watch.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Wonderful love story. Excellent character development. A must read. Love the sex scenes. Hard to put down, keeps you wanting more every time.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I wish Michael Connelly could write faster!  This book is another home run with his Harry Bosch novels.  If you like detective books, then you really need to read this one.  You will be hooked on Harry Bosch, too!
B00902AKK4|5.0|This is a challenging but fun and addictive game. I love the rewind button...none of my other games have that. Another great feature is the link to youtube to watch the correct solution. These great help features keep the game fun and keep me from getting frustrated.
0811879542|5.0|My mom gave this book to my daughter for Christmas last year when she was only 6 months old.  She loved it right away and would ask to do this over and over and over!  She caught on quickly to quite a bit of it, too!  Here we are, almost a year later and she still loves this book.  It's a great way to engage the child in the whole experience.  Cool idea!
B00GSE92F6|5.0|Excellent episode. I was looking forward to purchasing Day of the Doctor and An Adventure in Time and Space together.<br /><br />Last night the price of An Adventure in Time and Space was only 2.99, from what I have read in other reviews Day of the Doctor was priced similarly. Imagine my chagrin and immense disappointment when I checked the prices this evening and the prices were increased!<br /><br />If you pull more stunts like this, you're going to drive away more customers than you retain!
B009NF54ZE|2.0|this game is not very challenging and is rather boring. glad I got it for free. better for young kids than adults.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|My rating for this book is more like 4 & 1/2 stars. I say that because of the peace and turmoil that it gave me as I read and reflected on my own journeys in this life.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most about the book is that for the most  part is that it is very relative, and easy to understand. The author lets you explore another place in your mind without any guilt or fear. He also allows you to understand how important it is to know yourself, and appreciate important people that you meet in this life. It was an interesting experience of things already known mixed in with things needed to master.<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy was the length of the book. It was over in a matter of hours for me. The author could have added about two hundred more pages easily. Still a very good read though, despite my urge to continue reading!
B005COO1X6|4.0|This is a classic King short story – just enough to scare you a bit, the descriptions of the characters and scenery make you feel as if you are really there and, despite the strangeness of this particular horror story he makes you sort of believe the storyline is plausible.  You also have your laugh out loud moments as he describes some of the thoughts of his characters, and there’s even a reference to his Christine novel.  I found this one enjoyable, and if you are a King fan I would recommend this one.
B00GT4V5DM|5.0|I used to use Norton on my PC and got burned. My IT pro friends said to ditch Norton and use Malwarebytes. You should have seen - right after I did a full scan with Norton and installed Malwarebytes, it found 32 items Norton missed, including some serious ones that were slowing my PC's processing speed greatly.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Hi, I won't be too long-winded, suffice it to say that I really enjoyed reading this book.  The idea of virtual reality and the attraction I suppose we all feel to feel contained within an alternative reality is totally compelling.  It was really well written, believable and entertaining...though I confess I didn't really get caught up in the love drama....but apart from that it was just a great read.  Congratulations to the author...I imagine you put a huge amount of work into getting it off the ground.  Thank you.  B
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for my son, but I had to give it to him early since I knew he would buy it for himself.  The movie is great and the extras are amazing.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Showed some of the problems with new ideas in entrenched bureacracies, and the triumph of the human spirit over obstacles.  Plus, it was fun.

B00640UICA|4.0|Fun way to pass time.  Goes from simple to challenging.  Still trying to figure out some of the levels, but enjoying working my brain to do so.
B005MJ883K|4.0|A nice game to develop hand eye coordination. My kids are really enjoying it. A little bit pricey but money well spent.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|I thought the price was a bit high, but since I missed watching it live, and I was determined to see it, I guess that's how it goes.  Loved the show and do not regret paying the price to see it and to be able to see it again and again if I choose.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like this game however, it takes so very long to sell anything by ship and also it takes a long time to gain money. It would also be great to be able to gain free crowns as you level up like in some games. It's easy to play and it's cute.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|The best stories are timeless, and many of the episodes from the original series hold up quite well. As proof, I offer my college-age son who is now enjoying what I enjoyed when a child many years ago. You can't go wrong with this series. No nudity, no profanity, no perverse characters.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I down loaded this app twice there was no way to contact site for help with the problem  So I paid twice the information but the app is a great  source of info on weather,local,and out of town. Would just like  easier way to add other cities.
B009APMNB0|5.0|As a serious photo-hobbyist, I know the importance of monitor calibration.  A combination of monitor calibration and printer profiling provide the best opportunity for accurate prints.  It's definitely frustrating to alter an image in photo editing software and then be unable to print the image with the expected color tones.  This is the reason I've used a Pantone professional calibration tool for years.<br /><br />The Pantone X-Rite CMUNSML ColorMunki Smile, made in China, is meant for photo hobbyists, design enthusiasts, and gamers.  The box includes software, a quick start guide, and the calibration device.  System requirements include Windows XP and greater or MacOS 10.6 and greater, 500MB RAM, Intel Core 2 or AMD Athlon 64 2X or better CPU, 500MB free disk space, a powered USB port and a minimum display resolution of 1024 x 768 pixels.  An internet connection is only required for registration and updates.<br /><br />Installation starts with inserting the software disc into the disc drive and running the program.  The install process installs several items; each one asking for permission to install unless a trust this software maker box is checked.  Once all the software is loaded, a restart is required.  Then start up the ColorMunki Smile software.  The first step will be to register the calibration system on the x-rite website.  Once registered, the next step is to plug in the calibration devise and set up on the monitor to use.  Once calibration is complete, the monitor’s color profile is updated.  The software permits a before and after look.<br /><br />During this process, the only issue I had was the length of the cord on the calibration device.  I have my monitor set up on my desk while my PC tower sits on a wheeled stand on the floor.  I had to move my monitor forward and twist it to the side just to get the calibration devise in the correct position.  For those with this sort of arrangement, a longer cord would be beneficial<br /><br />If you’re altering your images on a monitor then printing only to be disappointed in the color tone differences, a monitor calibration tool is a great first step to resolving the problem.  The Pantone X-Rite CMUNSML ColorMunki Smile is a simple to use tool well worth using.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Amazingly simple monitor calibration tool<br />Makes color management simpler<br />1 year warranty<br /><br />CONS:<br />Calibration device cord could be longerering your images on a monitor then printing only to be disappointed in the color tone differences, a monitor calibration tool is a great first step to resolving the problem.

B00D0OR5EC|5.0|I loved this book. I saw the movie first which helped me read the book. But it is wonderful and worth the read. It is short but there's a lot that goes on in just 168 pages
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the game is fun and addicting. I'm impressed with the constant updates. the game has improved over the past year a lot.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|As long as you don't expect a breakneck racing challenge, this FREE game should please a wide range of ages. If battle strategy is not your thing, an auto deploy feature (so far) handles things adequately. Or you can plunge into the complex permutations and combinations of weaponry and troops--and potions and spells--that allow you to defeat the Boggins (spelling?) or your friends.<br /><br />EPIC does require some patience to wait for building, training, ripening, etc., but is that really such a bad thing?<br /><br />As with many games, the smart thing to do at first is to build your resources and let the program walk you through things for a while. There is more than one way to acquire some items, and it pays to wait in this charming world.
0451232852|5.0|My son said he loved this one.  He's a 26 year old that's going to college, working part-time and sometimes need a break just for casual reading and this is the author he chosens.

0446310786|1.0|My daughter had to read this for high school and constantly complained how boring and horrible it was.  I decided to give it a try.  Wow!!  She was actually right!  I just don't get why this book is so highly lauded and why it has been required reading for almost forever.  It just drones on and on and on until you really don't care about any of them.  I am really shocked.  We also watched the movie.  I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Yipes.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|This is a good story for all Americans to know.  It tells of how the Navajo soldiers created an unbreakable code that saved many American lives in WWII.  Although a bit gory, the film is well done with a good cast,  And as always, Nicholas Cage is superb.

B00A429YF6|5.0|A strange tale told very well.  This is a &#34;little&#34; movie that has a lot going for it.  Weird setting, strange people and a great, heartwarming story.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|These games are getting way too easy. Fine if you get them free. Not worth paying for. I would expect a challenge from a game like this. I also think all the dialogue is lame, a waste of time, and highly discouraged in games like this.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|There is an unsettling trend that has festered its way into Hollywood. I guess you could say it has been going on for years, but this is a little different. An author writes a trilogy (or more) of books geared toward young adults, they become popular and then Hollywood milks the public dry with movies that have no ending until they actually make the final movie; which could be delayed longer and longer, depending upon how much milking takes place. \\"Harry Potter\\" was the poster child for this trend and that was followed by the \\"Twilight\\" series, both of which split their final books into two movies for more milking.<br /><br />I call this an unsettling trend because often what happens is bad film-making; movies with no payoff, stories that are interrupted for months or years until they film and release the next chapter, movies that their entire purpose for existence is a side-story and finally, payoff after 4,5, or 7 movies that makes you realize that 4,5 or 7 movies was really unnecessary. I say this because \\"The Hunger Games\\" is one of those franchises' of films and you should be fully aware of these downsides that I just listed.<br /><br />Fortunately for \\"Hunger Games\\", it is spectacular film-making. Most importantly though, it is gifted with an amazing actress that effortlessly achieves the one thing that I think is the greatest asset that any movie can; empathy. Katniss Everdeen is an unwilling and sympathetic anti-hero and if you as an audience member don't feel the emotions that she is going through or are moving in your seat as she runs, dives and survives, you may need to check your pulse.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is more than the action movie that you would expect. It is brilliantly thought-provoking. Each character is drawn to complexity with great thought and performed with vigor by great actors. When Woody Harrelson's character Haymitch tells Katniss that the upcoming exercise is to find allies, the message is clear to her and to you the audience. From that point on, you the audience member and Katniss Everdeen are one in the same. You are studying the characters and your heart is racing when the events begin to unfold. Who does she trust? Who do you trust?<br /><br />You'd have to have been in a Turkish prison not to know that \\"Catching Fire\\" is the middle book of a three-book series and the second of a four-movie series. Therefore, despite its qualities, the movie builds you to a boiling point, the screen drops to black and on the screen comes the crackling burning mockingjay icon, signifying credits and a wink to you that you'll have to wait until November 2014 for part 1 of the rest of the story and November 2015 for the concluding film. Thanks for your cash! See you then! Hope you live that long!<br /><br />On the good side, rather than make you mad, the movie achieves its desired goal and lights an appropriate fire in your gut. I have already drawn three 'X''s on my living room wall. When I get approximately 365 of them, I can see the next movie.m that point on, you the audience member and Katniss Everdeen are one in the same.

B00866JL96|2.0|Was anyone expecting a movie starring Zac Efron to be particularly good? You should not be surprised by a two star review, the acting was pretty poor, the story was okay but overall it just feels forgettable to me.

B001HC8516|3.0|I enjoyed the book more so the humor of Greg, but it is not always based on life and the things that happen every time we are in a relationship. Sometimes we make bad choices in the relationship, but have to remember we did it to ourselves. We agreed to be FWB or to hang out with a guy and then we expect more and it does not always work out the way we see it in our heads. Shame on us for thinking guys want more, when we do the agreeing! Then we torture ourselves for what? Mr. Right is always around if we look, but we are to busy obsessing over the one who we let hurt us.
B00E9E4E50|4.0|Uneven performances of the Liszt pieces on this recording prevent me from giving this project a perfect score. You Tube sensation Valentina Lisitsa does present an interesting and challenging selection of Liszt pieces on this recording. This CD presents three long concert pieces, including the rarely performed El Contrabandista S252, a Hungarian Rhapsody, and 5 transcriptions of Schubert's songs. The 56 transcriptions Liszt composed of Schubert's songs are among Liszt's greatest piano works. In his hands he gave them new life. Many of them are very lovely and lyrical. Ms Lisitsa's considerable melodic gifts work well with these pieces. She plays them beautifully; I just wish there were more of them. The longer pieces on the album either don't stand out or in the case of the Ballade No2 fall  short of good performance standards. The Ballade suffers from excessive sustaining pedal usage, causing a loud blur of noise. The only thing I found interesting among the long pieces was the El contrabandista because I had never heard it before. I believe that she performed it correctly but it doesn't contain tunes that one will remember and play them over in their mind. In summary I hope that Ms Lisitsa continues on with performing and recording the lyrical pieces that she obviously has a great affinity for and leaves some of the longer ones alone. I do recommend this recording but can't give it an unqualified endorsement.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Has many to mix and match, even some presets for specific things like brain wave generation. Even a timer would recommend to anyone.

B00DUE8IXY|4.0|I loved Birdy's first LP.  Even though it was mostly covers, it really piqued my interest w/ its downtrodden, simpler, piano-centric approach.  So I had very high expectations for her sophomore release.  It appears to be aiming for a broader audience, and is far more pop friendly than her last.  It makes sense to me she'd take this route, but I don't know if I'd recommend this one as enthusiastically.  It's not a matter of her talent, b/c she clearly has it.  Although there are lyrical cliches and some very dated electronic drum/digital sounds, this album still works.  I simply skip the filler tracks and focus on the deeper, more serious ones.  I doubt pop culture will embrace her on a large scale, so depending on your musical tastes, your mileage may vary.
B00006D295|5.0|A great movie - even if one can't add the touches that one enjoys when watching it in the theatre.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|Sarah just keeps getting better.  Her first two albums are beautiful works of art that still give me chills.  Her instrumental virtuosity  and angelic voice are truly of the finest variety.  She's getting some recognition for it and one hopes she has a long career and continues to churn out quality music for our consumption.  I can't say enough about her as an artist.  If you like acoustic music, her entire catalog is worth throwing down some hard earned dollars for.  You will likely be a convert almost immediately.

B0054XOMX4|5.0|Phantom Orion B:D is the best non customized beyblade in the world! My son is a huge beyblade fan and he absolutely loved this beyblade. Hell Kerbecs, L drago destroy and Basalt Horogium (son has over 50 beyblades) give it close matches. But with it's over 7min (stop watch timed) spin time, it cannot be outlasted. If you have a bey stadium with no outs, he will NOT lose.<br /><br />The Takara Tomy beyblades are just better crafted than the Sonokong or Hasbro ones, although Sonokong is close. Be careful and do a thorough inspection of the seller you buy japanese beyblades from. There are numerous counterfeit beys on the market on both ebay and amazon. If you see the name GG or Rapidity anywhere on the packaging it is FAKE. If a seller has a bey for sell with no package, no launcher and no rip chord, odds are it's FAKE. Mani and New boy are official beyblade distributors and if those names are on the packaging it is authentic product. I have learned from experience so be careful. Happy Beyblading!!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The concept of this story is brilliant. The first sentence introduces a mystery that drives you to turn pages all story long. The events and backstory--on a macro level--are awesome. One of the most creative concepts I've read and I read a lot.<br /><br />But the execution of these concepts was sloppy. Characters suddenly swing into rages, standing and yelling at each other. The health and fitness aspects weren't believable (some people run distances too easily and later in the story are winded by less, healing happens too quickly. The social dynamics aren't nuanced--they're pretty stereotyped. And for a long while I wasn't sure I liked the main character.<br /><br />So it's worth reading, but you'll have to be patient with immature writing. I'm hoping the author got better in the next books.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Purchased Google Chromecast today, and I have to say I'm pretty satisfy with it. The setup was really easy, and I was able to connect the device with my Macbook in less than 10 minutes. It did take a few minutes to update the software, but other than that, it went on without any glitch.<br /><br />I was able to stream the typical Youtube and Netflix with lighting speed and amazing image quality. With the new software update, you are also able to stream more contents like Hulu, HBO, and Pandora.<br /><br />It also allows you to stream your Chrome tab, which is extremely important to me.<br /><br />1) You can cast other media sites, such as ESPN, which is currently not supported by Chromecast. You can simply navigate to the site, play the video, and click on the Chromecast icon to cast the webpage.<br /><br />2) You can cast local contents such as movie files or musics. I personally have a lot of MP4 files, and I was able to drag into the Chrome browser, and cast onto my TV without any problems. For AVI files, I had to download the Plex Media Server to cast the movies. It's not as direct as others, but you still have ways to work around it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really satisfied with this device. For $35, you can really take your media contents on the go.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Very good quality case for the price.  I have bought this case for my camera Canon Eos Rebel XSI with EFS  18-55 mm lens.  I found this case a little big with this lens.  It will probably fit better with a zoom lens.  I bought another Case Logic DCB-304, this fitt perfectly with this lens.  I keep my DCB-306 for futur use when I will get a zoom lens.

B006FE83UE|5.0|Absolutely one of the best classic movies.  A must watch and own  movie for anyone's collection.  The sound track music is beautiful.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game is so fun. But it got a low rating because I purchased some coins, and I never got them. I'm so annoyed!  When I went to report the problem, the app wouldn't submit so now there's no way to report the problem. This game would get five stars if I was able to get my purchase.

0061440795|4.0|A seventeen year old girl and her father are stumbling through life after the death of her mother, his wife. The father is a poster child for poor parenting; he brings a series of women into the home and takes his daughter to parties and casinos where she interacts with much older men, dancing, drinking and smoking. (After all, this is France.) Finally he may settle down and marry one of the women but the daughter, dreading rules and regulations, bed-time and study hours, spins a web of intrigue around them. The result? Well, let’s remember the title translates as “Hello Sadness.” (The book is translated from the French.) As I was reading this very short book (you can read its 127 pages in one sitting) I occasionally thought that it was a bit of stretch to believe that a seventeen-year-old girl could philosophize this deeply about love, life and men, and then I read that the author was nineteen when she wrote this book. Amazing!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is very fun and addicting but the game being free is not entirely correct.  As you get to higher levels you just about have to keep buying more moves to get past that level and they are .99 a pop.  That is why I gave only 4 stars.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Saw this song on YouTube and had to buy the single. Glad I did!  It didn't help that I went onto the 24-hour video site to see how other folks got down and I couldn't help but dance myself!  Great for the kids too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! it works great! of course I love pinterest too! I recommend it to everyone i know!
0385537131|4.0|The style of this novel is typical Grisham.  The pace is a little slower than most of his other works.  The first third of the book is excellent, top notch character and plot developments.  The book bogs down a bit in the middle, where essentially nothing is happening.  I got the impression that a novella was being stretched into a novel.  The pace and interest picks up again in the last third.  In my mind the ending isn't as dynamic as other reviewers have opined, but it is interesting, although predictable.  All in all, an interesting work, worth reading particularly if you enjoy the genre.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|it is an awesome game u have to play its challenging but addicting.  I love it.  its probably my favorite game out there.
1476727651|5.0|I'm an old fan of Stephen King but haven't read any of his stuff since &#34;On Writing&#34;.<br /><br />I won't bore potential buyers with a long-winded review.  I'll just say, with much confidence, you will not be disappointed with this book.  King takes you to places your imagination couldn't get to on its own...and then leaves you there.<br /><br />It was great fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I enjoyed this book... it was well written,its very descriptive and it contains wry humor unique to Mr. Grisham. The story line is gripping...Once again, well done!

0670024856|3.0|When I see a book about a female botanist in the nineteenth century, I expect one of two storylines: either \\"woman fights sexism to pursue her dreams\\" or \\"unconventional woman finds fulfillment in romance\\"--or both. This book flirts with both narratives but settles down with neither, and is better for it.<br /><br />The Signature of All Things is a big, ambitious book, beginning with the world-spanning exploits of one Henry Whittaker, thief turned botanist, in the late 1700s, before moving on to his daughter Alma about 50 pages in. Alma grows up fantastically wealthy and encouraged to follow scientific pursuits, falls in love with a local publisher, and you think you know where this is going.... but then, well, it doesn't go that way, and a third of the way through the book she's 48 years old, and then the real story begins.<br /><br />One of the difficulties with this novel is that there's no real driving plot--or rather, Alma's life is the plot, though there are some significant time-skips--but it consistently defied my expectations and kept my interest. It's a book about the Enlightenment, with a lot of research and discovery and expanding of horizons, and I came away impressed with Gilbert's respect for science. Alma is someone whose intellectual life is as important to her (perhaps more so) than her emotional life, and most authors would have a hard time writing about that sort of character in a positive and believable way--which makes sense; writing a good novel almost always requires an author to be intensely interested in feelings. But Gilbert balances the science and emotion well, and even has me looking at mosses (Alma's specialty) with new eyes. Her writing style itself draws the reader in, energetic and engaging and far more polished than I expected from someone best known for a mega-bestselling mid-life-crisis memoir (judge me all you like for that).<br /><br />But too often in this 499-page book I felt Gilbert was perhaps getting carried away with her writing. Whole sections go on far longer than necessary (the Tahiti episode, for instance); at least 50 pages could have been cut without harming the story. Worse, the book feels weighted more toward narrative summary than scenes, which means we're being told a lot about the characters and their activities rather than being in the story with them watching events unfold. I've noticed this problem in a number of recent novels, and I don't know whether it originates with authorial lack of confidence or just the desire to cram in everything about a character's life, but it results in a less engaging and memorable story. When Gilbert gets into the scenes, it's excellent: the solar system dance tells us more about Alma's childhood than all the summary preceding it, and lingers far longer in the reader's mind besides.<br /><br />The biggest problem with all the summarizing is that it distances the reader from the characters. Alma is well-developed and believable, and I enjoyed her story, but my investment came more from curiosity to know what would happen next than any emotional connection to her (and for all the science, this is still a novel, so emotional connections are to be desired). The secondary characters are colorful and often intriguing, but suffer from being described more than shown. Prudence, in particular, is potentially fascinating but gets too little page time, leaving her relationship with Alma not quite believable (they grow up together from the age of 10, without access to other children, and maintain a polite distance the entire time?). Ambrose works because we see his relationship with Alma develop as she experiences it. Retta is bizarre--in fact, all Gilbert's women have extreme personalities of one sort or another, and by the time Retta was introduced my suspension of disbelief was breaking. Henry is a mess of contradictions not really explained by the 50 pages spent on his backstory, though beginning with his adventures rather than Alma's childhoodwas an astute choice. For the most part I believed in these people, but by zooming out too often Gilbert kept me from truly knowing them.<br /><br />Overall, then, I found this a worthy novel but not a great one, though it has great potential that a firmer editor might have captured. Not having read Gilbert before, I found it a pleasant surprise and an enjoyable read, and admire its bold choices. I just wish it had been a bit more focused.was an astute choice.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The book is really amazing.  Brandon Sanderson is definitely establishing himself as an Epic fantasy novelist to be reckoned with.  Have yet to read anything he has written that has not captivated me from the outset.  Highly recommend the Mistborn Trilogy to anyone who has not yet read it.  Being a long time fan of Robert Jordan, I was concerned about his ability to complete such a massive Epic fantasy project, but was surprisingly pleased at how he pulled of what must have seemed like a daunting project.  Can't wait to see more from him.

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|To be honest , Arcade Fire wasn't one of my best band because there were a little bit still inmature in a musical way .However, sometimes I realized that they have the carisma to create something out of the ordinary and this album it really shows how mature become and now I'm looking forward to their next albums to come. Every song ,every details of the melody, evey art work; has a vey complex philosophy like scrumbling the unconcious of beign an &#34;artist&#34; .<br /><br />The songs went to whole conectivity of emotions plus I bet that James Murphy and David Bowie ,were the one who leads Arcade Fire to a ground that not so many artist/musicians  has. This is like Radiohead's &#34;Kids A or In Rainbows&#34; strings or U2's &#34;Acthug Baby&#34; .etc... ...  Be a musician is about beign ready for the unknown .<br /><br />Reflektor, is the Arcade Fire's mystery and discovery.<br />We exist,  is the funky ...&#34;cool guy&#34;<br />Flashbulb Eyes, is about stylish mood<br />Here Comes the Night Time , is the bloody celebration<br />Normal Person, is the clasick rock n roll about how a normal person is mean<br />You Already Know , is the classic ballad ,enjoyment about life<br />Joan of Arch , is the string that makes that connection with 2 part ... the theme is the feeling of never giving up<br />Here Comes the Night time 2 , is how someone is recovering from those unknown injuries<br />Awful Sound and It's never Over , is the complexity between a man and a women<br />Porno, this distinguishable songs show how  kids looses  their inocence<br />Afterlife , this is the song from &#34;heaven&#34; that gives hope<br />Supersymetry , is the ending of this extraordinary adventure in whcih is tranquil and menlancholic .Everything else becomes from a big dream to reality.<br /><br />In the end, this album it might be unpreciated from some critiques because they change their &#34;STYLE&#34; but in my opinnion they didn't change , just become more intelligent and wiser musicians.ns.

B005ZOBNOI|2.0|It is very poetic, and overall not a horrible book. However, it's just not my cup of tea. I like books that lead me to read between the lines and think about the irony of everything instead of just being told what it is. This book plainly tells you what it is. For example, Gus having a cigarette in his mouth yet not smoking. Green could have just lead us into figuring it out, but instead he automatically told us exactly what it was supposed to mean. Give your readers more credit.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Such a great book! I'll admit that it's not great for e-readers since it does have such great images that don't look as great on a kindle, therefore I did have to take away a star.<br />It starts out as being something every child coming of age can relate to; figuring out all those stories you heard when you were little were fake. But Riggs takes the idea a bit further. What if it is real, and the only reason everyone believes it's fake is because they refuse to believe it as real?<br />Where some other reviewers wrote how they lost interest in the story towards the middle, I must say that's where I got even more intrigued, because that's where Riggs started develop each character and story lines setting way for everything that is about to happen, and hopefully continues on in the next book.<br />As for those who didn't read til the end, keep going! That's where all of the action happens (however if you're reading it for the first time to try to skip ahead. The middle part is important!!!)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A wonderful fact filled book that everyone should read. I doesn't change beliefs it just makes them real. Great research.

0385537131|5.0|This book shows John Grisham at the height of his career as a premier writer of legal fiction. The reemergence of characters so well known to us from &#34;A Time To Kill&#34; is comforting to the reader.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Ugh!  A very self indulgent, self absorbed piece of tripe!  It is so hard for the pretty and popular when they have to grow up even though they really never do!  This was worse than watching something about the hardships of being rich.  There was no real resolution, no sudden enlightenment, nothing.  Save your time and watch Heathers again.

B000FA5TTW|5.0|I know, I'm ten years late reading this, but it's as good as all the reviews said at the time. It's haunting, and thought-provoking, and a good story about how we grow after we lose the ones we love, and how they (surprisingly) grow as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Used to love Grisham until he started cranking them out, but I still try one occasionally, hoping against hope that I might find something of the urgency and excitement of his early work.  This one puts me to sleep every night although now that I have reached about 85 percent on my kindle, I am starting to become interested in the outcome.  I could go on and on about the inept and boring character development, dialog or lack thereof, etc. but I'm going to attempt to stay awake long enough to finish it tonight and move on to something worth staying awake for.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Excellent.  Not his best but well worth the read and I would recommend it highly.  One of my favorite authors of all time.
1616550414|4.0|This is a beautifully made book that attempts to and mostly succeeds at providing a consistent storyline to all the Zelda games.  The paper quality is good and the cover itself is gorgeous.  I would say the only negative is how much is spent on Skyward Sword.  It's not that the game is bad, but roughly a third of the book seems devoted to it.  However, this could be great news to fans of the game  as it's loaded with art and lore.<br /><br />This book should be considered essential for Zelda fans that would value a quality coffee table book at a great price.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|First - I know a lot of people are freaking out about the ending and saying the book was awful because of it.. but honestly, if you care that deeply about what happens to the characters at the end, then the author must have done a darn good job! If the books were terrible, who would really care about any of it??<br />Alright, on to my review:<br />Excellent way to wrap up the series. Personally, I would have taken chapters 52 and 53 and put them at the end of the book, I think they are the perfect end to the story... I liked the chapters that came after 53, because they helped to tie up some other lose ends... so I wouldn't delete them... but, I still would have liked the book to end with chapter 53.<br />The only thing I really didn't like was that the reader alternates point of view in the third book; some chapters being from Tris' perspective, others from Tobias'... it got confusing for me, and more than once I had to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself whose head I was supposed to be in.<br />All that said, I grew to love these characters, and will miss reading more of their journeys... which I think is the highest compliment a reader can give to a book.

B003G4W49C|5.0|It's very fun, if you don't mind the premise of a culture that thinks it's okay to force a child into doing things (after he agrees to the program of course).  The thing that pushes this beyond the ick factor is all the things he is able to do.  It is not just bullying - which it is at times.  He pushes through to really... well we don't want to give it away now.  I read it years ago and loved it.  I just read it again and wish the second book was more like this one.  It is dark, but also intense and meaningful.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Works well for youtube and Netflix but currently that's about it. I hoped I could stream whatever I was looking at on my computer onto the TV but it doesn't work that way. It only works with web pages that it is set up for. If you want to watch a show on your favorite TV channel website it wont work. Since I have other means of streaming youtube and Netflix (my Xbox) it was a waste of money.
0385537131|5.0|Grisham at his very best. Lots of zigs and zags. Loved every page. The best! Enjoyed the hell out of it in traditional book form....
B002BJGYV2|1.0|I bought Gilmore girls season five it was supposed to be new but the one I received has a big tear in the case that the dvd's slide into and it has been resealed over top.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game has great graphics. It is just a really fun game. Took a long time to download but worth it. I highly recommend it!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|1st 24 minutes of the film was action packed ! The rest of the move was fantastic as well. Glad I rented it ! I normally do not care for Zombie movies, but this one was far better than any I've seen before. A virus attacks the entire world ! Gut wrenching excitement.
B00G3HSF7O|1.0|I have never written a review before but this movie was so bad that I must warn others to prevent further suffering. There are just too many scenes that did not make any senses at all. I seriously regretted watching it. The concept of this movie was great but nothing else. There's so much I could point out that's bad about this movie but I am too lazy to type them all in detail. I'll list some in bullet points just to summarize.<br /><br />Pros<br />* Concept of the movie<br />* Matt & Jodie<br /><br />Cons<br />* Many scenes do not make sense<br />* Most fight scenes are just horrible<br />* Unexplained technologies<br />* State of the art space station with NO self defense system OR scrutiny in place. Their self defense system was an old ex military guy shooting rockets from earth.<br />* The ultra advanced Elysium system apparently can be rebooted in a Linux window by typing &#34;system reboot&#34; not even a nice looking UI ..........................<br />*There are just too many................... my god..................
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is very compatiable with the Kindle Fire because it allows you to easily access to songs, and ringtones. I love it, and highly reccomend this. :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the games but its too much to ask friends to help on advanced levels. i would rather play on my own.
0062255657|1.0|This book is really different. Did not enjoy it.  Appeared to be more of a fantasy than a normal novel.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|this movie is pretty much what one would expect, were it not for slightly higher expectations from as visually imaginative a director as Guillermo del Toro.  but, if you want to see giant robots battle giant alien monsters, this is what you asked for.  the plot and acting is not the draw here - it's BIG battles.  still, this film does underscore just how awful the Transformers franchise is...
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Kinda your average build a empire game. Not to say it isn't fun, it is. Good development trees and nice vehicle concepts
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I liked all the characters and thought the surprise ending,identifying the killer was well done. I would have liked to have learned a little more about the killer before the story ended.
1422188612|4.0|I was going through the process of looking for a new job and someone recommended this book for me.  This book is great.  I don't keep many books but I plan on keeping this one and re-reading it any time that I am changing position or simply looking for inspiration.  I think this is a must have if you are switching jobs.  It is an excellent work book to help you get started fast as well as evaluate your strengths and areas of improvement.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This CD is definitely a five star rating / If you like Dream Theater this is a must have<br />I love all music from this prog band<br />New drummer Mike M has been a great addition to this group, they've come up with a very good new music<br />Keep it going Dream Theater
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was the first Neil Gaiman book I had read in a while.  It was recommended by a friend.  It was such an engaging read that upon finishing I promptly bought three more of his books.  This is a story about childhood with the mind-bending twists that Neil Gaiman is known for delivering.  It is an easy and interesting read.
B001P5M7QE|4.0|Always a great movie. Picture quality isn't the best but I guess there's only so much they can do to fix that.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I've been looking for a new supernatural series to sate my need, and I just new that the cast team would not fail. I'm starting the next book immediately. I was a bit apprehensive at first with the alternate spelling of vampire, and the whole, marks/tattoos, but it's Awesome, loved book one.
B004JMY312|5.0|Classic Disney Halloween movie. I have been watching it every year around halloween as since I was a kid and it's great every time. Pretty clean movie, so great for the family. There's also a lot of corny humor which I always like. Great traditional halloween movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OmG my mom is so ADDICTIVE to candy crush saga she place all day all night all the time this game is so FUN
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Awesome series. The story line really pulls you in and keeps you on edge and the cast is amazing. A lot of great acting and exciting surprises.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Great game for all ages. Graphics are awesome and it passes the time. Only downer is that it takes a bit of time to load the game up.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My granddaughter loves characters like this, She's very visual and actually gets more of the dialogue that I would have imagined.
B00DQJJAB2|5.0|I wish I could give this beyond a 5 star ranking.  As for the music, there's nothing to complain about.  It is all perfect.  The surprises are what make this album so surreal.<br /><br />When it first arrived, I thought there was some mistake.  It looked way too big in the package.  But when I got it out, I saw why.  It comes not in the shape of a normal CD, but in a big hardcover book! I think there is about a 40-page layout of Kreator photos live worldwide. And it comes with a demo CD for &#34;Phantom Antichrist.&#34;  It is only a demo album, so there isn't much to expect, but it is cool.<br /><br />But what really pushes this product over the edge is the video.  It comes with a DVD and a Blu Ray (both of the same footage).  Watching this concert is amazing.  The way that the band commands the stage and the crowd is breathtaking.  And when you are driving around listening to the CDs, it is the same music that is on the video, so you can easily imagine it.<br /><br />And, on the back of the booklet, there is a picture of Mille flipping you off in front of some adult store.  Just when you think he mellowed out, there's that--ha!
B001FAFO3W|5.0|One of my granddaughters new favorite movies. Watches it evry few days and never seems to tire of it.Actually she rarely tires of most movies, but some are definitely more favorite tham others.
B00000HZH7|5.0|Even to this day, some metal maniacs get touchy  about when death metal began and who made the first album of the genre.  Generally, Possessed, Death and Morbid Angel are the three bands that are tossed into the debate.<br /><br />The times that these bands were formed seem to generate some controversy.  However, one thing cannot be debated.  That is that the copyright year of this album--1985--is earlier than anything that either of the other two bands produced.  Heck, the last song on the album is actually titled, &#34;Death Metal.&#34;  And it is a rip-ride to say the least.  So, for a historical perspective, metal enthusiasts may want to consider owning this album because it really is the first death metal album ever released.<br /><br />There are 10 songs on this album, and they are all as brutal as you probably imagine. Yes, they band was surely trying to employ shock rock to sell this album--hence the inverted cross and the devil's tail on the cover.  To this day, this sort of thing has a corny, nostalgic feel.<br /><br />Back to the music--the title track, &#34;The Exorcist,&#34; &#34;Holy Hell&#34; and &#34;Death Metal&#34; all warrant a 5 star rating.  The raw fury of this music aptly qualifies this band to call themselves, &#34;Possessed.&#34; It requires little imagination to see that this is perfectly foundational music for a growing genre at the time.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Not, problems-sleeping-that-night scary like &#34;Exorcism of Emily Rose&#34; but not completely jump-out-at you scary like other ghost movies, but a little mix of both.  The jump out parts are manageable because they are so obviously coming.  Movie was entertaining and interesting to watch.  Unique from most &#34;this was real&#34; ghost stories in that they also follow the ghost hunters as well as the family being haunted.
B0006HXXBA|4.0|This album is only a tick below &#34;Hordes of Chaos.&#34; It is hard to believe that a bunch of 40-somethings could rock like this, but here they are.  The only minor gripe I have with this album is that the mixture of slower songs is too overlapped into the second half of the album.  If &#34;The Ancient Plague&#34; had been moved swapped with &#34;Dystopia&#34; (swap tracks 12 and 5), I'd probably rank it as a 5 star album.  However, you can always use random track sampling to circumvent this.
0307271080|5.0|wonderful novel! I could not put down the book until I finished it and I wanted to read it again as soon as I finished!
B004YOEFG8|4.0|El Hubble y sus tomas son algo fantástico, fabuloso logro, que expande la idea que teníamos del misterio del universo. No obstante esperaba más tomas de otras regiones del cosmos mostrando más maravillas fuera de la imaginación, desde que el Hubble fue puesto en órbita y no tanta descripción del aprestamiento previo al viaje de mantenimiento de astronautas y equipos, porque eso es bastante conocido.
B008KE3960|4.0|I'm a aircraft lover but I think the gear doubler and collector must be free.<br />Also the sliverfinger doesn't kill tanks so I say lower the gear price.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I first had it on my iPod touch 4G, but it was slow and lagged a lot. I love the game on my kindle fire hdx, it's fast, fun, has great graphics, and keepers my attention for hours. Love it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was a great story; told with the authority that I have come to expect from John Grisham.  Several twists and turns that one wouldn't expect in a novel.
B008Y6RYDS|4.0|A classic 60's counter culture film with a fine soundtrack. Some headliner stars are in the film early in their careers.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have most of Michael Buble's CDs. He is just a fantastic singer. I listen to his last several CDs all the time and I am just in awe of how good a musician he is. He just knows how to make a song his own and sell it. If you like Crazy Love and Call Me Irresponsible, you will like this one.
0425252868|5.0|What a gift Adam Makos has given the world by faithfully researching, writing and sharing the amazing story of two men, each of whom were swept up in their respective nation's military during WWII. It reads like a novel, but has a much deeper meaning. Through these two mean, Makos shares the awfulness of war and the amazing fortitude of the human heart. Well done, sir. Well done!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I saw this same show in Las Vegas, and the CD captured the moment. It includes almost all of their well known songs and a few less memorable ones as well. Certainly captures the magic of their live performance.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|It's two A.M. And I can't put the book down.<br />She's back to her old great form ( both Cornwell and Scarpetta).<br />great characters, great story.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a wonderful story of love, risk, family, and loss. I couldn't put it down, and when it was over, I wished there were more.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Blows. Nothing like the TV comercial lag on a 1300mbps fast wireless is horrible.  get a roku or WD streaming box, they are more money but in this case cheaper is not better
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Amazon's app store has been considerable behind most app stores ex. Google and Apple. But has started moving in the right direction by starting to increase the amount of mainstream apps and games they are finally putting themselves in a sales smart spot. The only app they need left is an instagram app so we can have the full version instead of these cheap ones but hopefully Amazon is working on that. The only negative thing I can say about this app is that on kindled we get the normal updates much after Apple and Google does.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Great visuals. Uninteresting storyline. So, what more can I say. Hopefully the new Godzilla is better. We shall see, though.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This much anticipated final book moved slowly and erratically for the entire duration.  Roth's ending was unimaginative, disappointing, and pointless.  She does not have the depth, as a writer, that is required to pull this decision off and it is my desire that the masses leave Tris and Four's world at the second book.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This books starts off a bit &#34;cheesy&#34;.  I found it hard to get into initially because it was not particularly well-written.  However, once you get past the first thirty pages, the story really sucks you in.  This is a great book for discussion in book groups because this book covers a tough topic.
B00BATG18K|5.0|This book will forever change the way I value relationships and the power of forgiveness. A truly strong and moving novel. A must read for anyone who has ever questioned love, forgiveness, and the deep rooted relationship between mother and daughter.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|A fun time waster.  Doesn't require a lot of mental energy, so great for killing time.  My oldest enjoys playing it as well.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train was a story of children coming to fine a new family. It is very sad on how some of the children had to live. I live in NE and have heard story from some of the women who were children that come to NE on the Train. The book so ture some happy but so many sad.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|The story line, costumes, accessories, hair-do's make you feel like you're right there with them.  I was sorry to hear they have ended their story.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|I rather enjoyed this film.  I really don't understand all the negative chest thumping about this movie.  Yes, it definitely has it's faults, but overall I don't think it's getting the credit that it is due.  So, let's talk about the pluses for a moment.<br /><br />Great cast.  Russel Crowe is terrific.  Henry Cavill is great as Superman.  He's got the looks, the features, the mannerisms and he's a decent actor.  Lawrence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, etc.  All great actors.  Micheal Shannon nearly steals the show with a fantastic version of General Zod.  Finally we get a Lois Lane that is a knockout.<br /><br />Loved Krypton and the Kryptonians.  Great interpretation of the world of Krypton.  Instead of a shining beacon of civilization, it is a society in decline and mired in civil war.  Interesting concept.  The Kryptonians themselves were very well done.  You just can't beat the Gothic look with ancient suits of armor.  The entire opening act could almost be a movie in itself.  I should also point out the the costumes were great, especially the one's worn by Zod and his rebels.<br /><br />Great action.  Some really good no holds barred fighting scenes.  I liked that the movie didn't hold back in this area.  I grew up reading comic books, and fighting was always the payoff.  I'm glad the producers went away from Kryptonite.  That gets so old after while.  No, this movie relies on antagonists that are the equal of Superman.<br /><br />Special effects.  I know most movies have great effects, so I wont use this as a major selling point.  However, it's obvious that no expense was spared in this area.<br /><br />Characters.  Zod and Faora were a great surprise for me.  Terrence Stamp put the bar pretty high, and Shannon answered the call.  This time though, Zod isn't a maniac hell bent on ruling everyone at all cost.  No, this version of Zod is obsessed with restoring Krypton to its former &#34;glory&#34;.  That's a big difference and I liked the change.<br /><br />Like I said, there is plenty to like about this film.  That being said, I must also point out some of the minuses.<br /><br />Plot.  I've watched several times and the plot still confuses me.  I still don't get what the Codex is all about.  That definitely could have been improved.<br /><br />Overkill collateral damage.  You could definitely make a case that a war between super powered beings could lay waste to a lot of the planet, but it was a bit much.  It kind of mentally wore me out in the theater.  Reminded me of the chaos of the Transformers........which is definitely a bad thing.<br /><br />Jonathan Kent.  Oh, my.  This was the every worst interpretation of Jonathan Kent that I could ever imagine.  Ugh.  Terrible!<br /><br />Script.  Well, there were a few lines that made me wince a little.  Not the best script at times.<br /><br />To each his own, but I'm giving this movie a solid thumbs up.  The Blu Ray itself is great.  Amazing picture quality and sound.  You might want to go a little easy on the volume on your home theater for the final act.  It can get real loud.  I consider this a must see for any fan of super hero movies.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|Memories from the old days when I was a teenager in Belgium. It brings me back to the sixties in high school.
B000002UZ4|5.0|I'm 58, but still enjoy the offerings of many of the 80's groups.  This CD consistently offers music and beats that makes long car trips fun.
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|This is one of my favorites albums, I specially listen several times a week the song \\"If There Wasn't Something There\\". I also recommend \\"Nothin' Can Save Ya\\" with Fatoumata Diawara.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a wonderful insight to the way presidents make use of their predecessor. In many cases we see savvy politicians utilize a popular man, but often we see politicians use the wisdom of their predecessors. Obama does not come off well in sharing the stage.
1608838137|5.0|I really enjoy period movies.  The costumes, accessories,hair styles and location settings were perfect.  Downton Abbey has such a good script that you just can't wait to see what will happen next.  Looking forward to Season 4.
0061950726|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It's history.  It  tells the sory of the Orphan Train, taking children west to be adopted.  Often they are just used almost as slaves.  The story adds today's story of foster children, aging out and the problems that arise.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|I just received our Perplexus Epic and after reading other reviews stating that some had come without a ball I made sure to check ours.  Guess what?  No ball!  If you're buying this as a gift, ours was going to be a Christmas present, please make sure to check for the ball!  In the meantime, I will be contacting amazon for a replacement.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A great book worth reading.  It's a great story about a real character making his way back to his own humanity via the baseline of modern society.  Read it.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|I love Susan Boyle's singing and I especially love her renditions of the Christmas carols on this cd.  I especially love the last track on the cd which has a hymn that is new to me called &#34;Miracle Hymn&#34;.  It is a lovely hymn and Susan Boyle sings it so beautifully.  I could listen to this cd for hours.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This just happened to catch my eye. I loved it. Didn't see the ending coming and am usually good at predicting endings. This is wonderful.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|fun game but way too much tapping to get past the pointless dialog. hidden objects are not difficult to find unless you have extremely poor eyesight and the puzzles are easy enough for a kindergartener. glad this was a free app of the day or I never would have completed it
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|A very funny movie. I would have gave it a 5 star except the ending of the movie was anticlimactic.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|To this point, Josh Groban's &#34;Noel&#34; was the best Christmas album I've ever heard.  I still love it, but I have to say, these young Italian men are right up there with the best.  Their voices have matured from their earliest recordings...but they still have amazing harmony, yet they're all so good as lead vocalists. They hit some notes in &#34;O Holy Night&#34; that sent chills down my spine. I can't rate it any higher than 5 stars...but this is an absolute stunningly beautiful Christmas album.  If you enjoy singing at its best, buy this album today...you will be so happy you did.  They capture what my wife and I enjoyed about living in Europe (Germany and Italy)...the true beauty of the holiday.  Il Volo is magnificent!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Love Gilmore Girls until 7th season. 5 stars for seasons 1-6. Rumor is 7th season has a different writer, GG is nothing without Amy Palladino.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|Apparently Hemmingway captures the essence of life philosophy for the survivors of &#34;the Great War&#34;. The&#34; let's be miserable trying to have a good time while we attempt to figure out what life is really about&#34;outlook seems to be almost universal after experiencing widespread death and destruction. While I found this novel only mildly entertaining I do appreciate it's capture of the search for a purpose for living.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter's favorite movie.  She goes through different phases, but this one has lasted longer than most.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome. just an awesome game that everyone should play for hours on end. I highly reccomnd this game for all ages.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun app but I get so mad when I am stuck on a game that is impossible to beat.
B00AYYH71W|5.0|This brain maze was a birthday gift for my 9 yr. old grandson.  During his party, I think every adult in the room had asked to try it.  The puzzle ball will be a hit for years to come!

0330490702|5.0|Another great book by Ken Follett and a follow up on Pillars of the Earth, great reads. You will get hooked!
B00FN3HRFA|5.0|My God!  She's amazing...still!!!!!  At age 70, 71, she still makes the hairs on the back of one's neck stand on end.  What an incredible selection of songs...she says they're songs she loves by composers she loves, and that's exactly how they're sung, with such respect for the songwriter; and how flattered they might be to have their works in the overly capable hands of this lady.  I was so excited with today's release of this album.  I downloaded it and have made copies for friends.  And now I look forward to the PBS special the night after Thanksgiving.  I've been an avid fan of Barbra's since the 60's.  What amazes me is that she so often sounds just as good as she did forty-five years ago...no, better, for maturity plays a big part in the manner in which she puts over her music today.  If you don't have this new release in your possession, I hope that won't be for long.
B00E9A656K|4.0|why do they put gas it just waste your time of playing this app do you agree it takes away time of you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, can be a good way to use your mind and using logic. But then again it all can blow up.
1451626088|4.0|Very interesting and well written. Anne Neville is a very special character of English history. Born as the youngest daughter of the Earl fo Warwick, destiny reserves her a very special role to play. This book let us share her rise, her fall and again her rise in the time of the last Plantagenets kings. And with her we witness the last years of the Cousins' Wars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|like the title says...it's a simple calculator that works great and it's easy to see. what else do you need?
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is super great. I've had it for 3 months and I haven't once gotten tired of playing! I would recommend this for everyone!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My little sister loves this she plays it for hours and hours and she loves all the little pets, I like it too!
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|very well made movie that has great character development incorporating not only the passion and emotion of the fights, but also adds a family struggle in addition to other powerful themes to the storyline. really had no expectations and really enjoyed the movie! more of a guy movie, but still a tear-jerker/nail-biter.
B00FLNRN06|2.0|Cookie cutter formula. The only funny part was the 2 minutes of gag reel at the end of the movie.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|it is a fun game. but it has problems. when I tried to get on. only the coins and stuff showed up. the ponies and their houses didn't.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this game a lot.  I have it on both kindles and when I run out of lives on one I play the other.
1401234550|4.0|This was a pretty easy introduction to the Green Lantern universe without necessarily having to know the full history. Sinestro is great at driving the story and made this a quick and easy read. I didn't love that Hal was a loser without the ring but I understand using it as a starting position. It's a shame the final collected issue in this hardcover had a notably different artistic style, otherwise it's a 5/5 for me.
B00GS1DM2S|5.0|Music - The OST is great as always, just not as good as the previous installments. the intro is the amazing drum beat familiar drum intro  that I only know as EM20 =[ native to 2.22. The credits theme is Sakura Nagashi which was featured on the teaser trailer and will warrant sitting through the entire credits.<br /><br />Animation - The animation is great, almost so much so it could carry the film alone; amazing CG in the beginning will have you hooked. Pacing and animation quality just droops in the middle though for heavy dialogue  in order to keep us viewers somewhat oriented on what the heck is going on.<br /><br />Story - a truely dark, open-ended and tragic Mecha that lives up to the name &#34;Evangelion&#34;. The a 14 yr gap between this and 2.22 along with progressively convoluted endings makes 3.33 a prime showcase of Anno's relentlessly confusing yet mesmorising storytelling. It also makes this film a true &#34;love it or hate it&#34; experience with questions left unanswered and no garauntee that they will be in the next film.<br /><br />Characters - Kaurowu's deep devlopment and interaction with Shinji was a major plot line in the film, and its highlight; his sincerity brightens up the series to guide you through the dark and dismal story all the way to the end. I'm so glad Anno had a chance to rebuild his series, as Kaurowu deserved so much more screen time than he got in the original series.<br /><br />Awe Factor - by far the most convoluted ending (and begining for that matter) so far in the rebuild, but more traditional to Anno's &#34;WTF&#34; story-telling. Almost every character is emotionally screwed up and is just an experience watching them and their turmoil.<br /><br />SUB/DUB - The performances were all great in my opinion (still preferred Japanese ofc). I've had the chance to view the dubbed 3.33 premeir and meet Spike Spencer/Mike Mcfarland. Based simply on the fact he has been voicing Shinji for 15 years now, he does the job better than anyone else could; but you can tell (and he said it himself) voicing a 14 yr old conflicted, emotional, mentally unstable rejected introvert is no easy task and thus will always be a little grating on the ears. Aside from Shinji, you can tell the rest of the cast  were seasoned and very comfortable with their roles; Kaurowu excelled as a lead and new cast member. Actually kind of excited to own this dub.<br /><br />DVD - I'll update as soon as I rip open this package.<br /><br />Overall - 1.11 and 2.22 attracted as many new fans as possible with the classic &#34;flashy mech battles&#34; theme, only to be psyched out with 3.33, as Anno seemingly loves to do. Seasoned EVA fans will enjoy this visual/mental beating (in a spectacular new BD format at that), but those who hoped  the straightforward cast/plot and fast paced mech battles of 1.11 and 2.22 were going to last will be dissapointed.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I love Whitney Houston, but I did not enjoy the music selected for this Holiday Album.  I took a chance getting the album because it was Whitney.  I would have preferred more traditional Christmas music.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!!  LOVED IT!!!  This book really makes you realize what is important in life and how lucky you are to have your health!

B00DYFCYSO|3.0|John is talented and has a GREAT voice but there are too many ballads and not very stimulating!  I want to be excited when I hear music - even slow songs can draw you in, but this one doesn't.

B00GO95TAC|5.0|This is THE episode all Whovians have waited for. Anyone who hasn't it yet, don't make any comments till you see it! I watched it three times on the day it was released.<br /><br />That I think this episode is excellent is an understatement! Seeing David Tennet onscreen with Matt Smith, watching the the pair of Doctors interact was amazing!<br /><br />I'd love to give story or plot, but... SPOILERS! lol<br /><br />True Whovians, enjoy!<br /><br />-note- The worldwide simulcast broke a record in the Guiness Book! Go to BBCdotcom for more details!

B000WS4QJG|5.0|Michael is the BEST - his songs will remain some of the best music EVER!!  Never get tired of hearing him after all these years!!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I listened to this as an audio book.<br /><br />The woman who read this book did a great job. I didn't notice anything particular about her, which when listening to an audio book, is a good thing. She was engaging and well spoken. 5/5 stars for the reader.<br /><br />This book was really good. Cheryl was an entertaining writer throughout. I listened to Bill Bryson's 'A Walk in the Woods' a year or so ago and thought this would be like his book, just from a woman's perspective. That was an incorrect assumption. If that is what you are looking for, be prepared that this book, while it does talk of her hike on the PCT, was also about other things in her life.<br /><br />Cheryl hiked the PCT when she was 26, alone. She was completely ill prepared and alone. Sure, she met the occasional person who helped her out or was at least a companion for a few hours, but for the most part she was alone. Not really the smartest thing I've ever heard of, but to each their own.<br /><br />Cheryl's story is not just that of her hike, however. This book is half about her hike and half about her life leading up to it. Her mother had died 4 years before and she wrote of her struggles with the death, her marriage, heroine, and other difficulties as a child. At times I wanted her to stop talking about her previous life and tell more about the hike and the trail. But then, inevitably, her trail talk would turn into her brutally damaged feet (from buying boots a size too small and not knowing it until about 10 people had told her so) and her lack of money.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, don't get me wrong, but sometimes it became a bit repetitive with her lack of preparation and ignorance to the trail.<br /><br />If you like reading memoirs about hiking and the outdoors, you'll like this book.

B0063IH60K|3.0|Until today, I could play as many games in a row and not worry as about the game responding. Today, I've had the game stop responding at least 10 times.
B00BATKPBE|4.0|I received this book through a First Reads giveaway. Thank you!<br /><br />This book covers Dawkins' life up to publishing The Selfish Gene, his very popular first book. It seems as though this story is to be continued in a second installment as well.<br /><br />His early life, and before he was born, relies very much on his mother's journal entries. A time in WWII African while his father was involved with the war and he and his mother were moving around living with various other families. The story continues up through the years which is lived away at a boarding school in Africa and then in Europe.<br /><br />He then goes on the describe in great detail his years at university studying zoology, moving to the US to work at a university in California, then shortly thereafter going back to Oxford.<br /><br />Those early years I found the most interesting. Hearing about himself as a young child, the thoughts and beliefs he had and at what age he finally became the firm atheist he is today. His personality that shows through his writing is funny and very entertaining. It made for a very enjoyable read.

B00785P2QC|1.0|I would rate this 0 stars if I could.  After waiting for 2 days for this to download all it does is open the company's store that doesn't even load fully.  No game at all.  Major waste of everything involved.  Everything from this company takes days to install even after downloading from Amazon.  Huge disappointment!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|very good app.  i like the fact i dont have to be on wifi to play.  i am enjoying the game very much.

B004SH40BQ|5.0|Extremely easy to setup, very reliable.<br /><br />My wife became the &#34;DJ&#34; at her job aided by her iPod classic, the Kokkia i10s and a high quality JBL Bluetooth speaker.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I like this game a lot.  Not too challenging but still makes you think. Love the variety of different games, never gets boring. Wish you could skip past the story lines if you want to, can take a while to get to next game. Over all I really like and enjoy this game.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|What can I say, but ABSOLUTELY the best movie as far as I am concerned!  Have watched it many, many times already!!  Most certainly the inspiration for my cosplay as Hawkeye!!
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|One of the greats.  The whole album is a classic. This is a must have for any Led Zeppelin fan.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have fun with this game. Just started not too long ago but it would be nice to know where you can pick up certain loot.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I like the Tudors quite well , but I can see how some people will and perhaps should have a problem with it. His attitude is quite big and he is pompous and a womanizing pig. Now that might have been a realistic capturing of his personality but I know that some people would have preferred it to have been played down and perhaps a bit more politically correct in today's times. So I guess what I am saying is that while this series might have been true to facts (not saying it was, saying if it was) and I appreciate that some might not. That is the reason for the missing star.
B0041KX354|5.0|It was no use burning this version until the 24th of November and now I'm able to watch it. I was supposed to watch this around October. But then I was in a delay.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like that you don't have to spend money in order to play it.  Over good game. Moves along really well.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|This a great book for pony lovers and Fairytale lovers as well. I was impressed at the detail of the story. My daughter is in Second Grade and I bought it for her and she has read it many times already. I got her the DVD last week but the book she likes better for another read. I hope the writers will find a way to continue to have pony stories as the serries and to have these girls as well. So many of my little girls friends love them as well, the dolls fly off the shelf fast. Great idea for the Hard to buy for creative minds of the Early readers that dont follow the ponies. Anyone can enjoy this book that loves the ponies at any age,
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Forsyth had lost his touch a bit in his previous work &#34;Afghan&#34;. Afghan was a bit tame in the end, despite a strong build up. The Kill List marks his return. Its a phenomenal story, very well crafted and even better narrated. There are portions where you may forget that you are reading a spy thriller, it sounds more like a non fiction account of how terrorism work. That is the true strength of the book, it takes you behind the scene in real time and makes you a part of the narrative. It a single sitting unputdownable thriller
B0013FBS20|5.0|This is a great movie, i have watched it quite a few times now and i am very happy with it
B00F88U4J6|3.0|It just wasn't what I needed. I am sure it's fine for what it is for. But I needed a program that would read any screen on my tablet not just books and I misunderstood.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|My all time favorite!!! such a witty, sexy and amazing book. Drew is just perfect in this book. You truly get a glimpse into a man's head with this one and the way it was written is just awesome. He's hysterical and you'll totally fall for him.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A stunning read written by an extremely intelligent young woman considered sufficiently dangerous to the uneducated Taliban chief of her hometown area that she was marked for assassination.  The attempt nearly worked.  The book highlights the inherent dangers involved in a religious belief that considers women to be second class citizens unworthy of respect, ineligible for education and the property men.  Sound familiar?  Her story is so compelling that she was invited to speak at the United Nations to an audience of ambassadors.
B00EMGUT1I|4.0|Lemmy is still doing it.  Like AC/DC, Mot&ouml;rhead has a formula that works and they continue to make their own brand of rock.  Good album.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Don't get me wrong this is a wonderful game and it's pretty hard to suck at haha<br />But once I reached like level 12 it wouldn't let me get back into the game it didn't happen to my brother but on me so I deleted it and started over and it happened again so I'm pretty passed off right now so I recommend not getting this game but I would at the same time.
0316322407|4.0|This book is about a young Pakistani girl of 16 years old who on 9 October 2012 was shot three times by the Taliban and survived.They shot her as she was outspoken about education for girls but the Taliban is against this.She ended up in Birmingham hospital and survived.<br /><br />Her book is in three parts.The first is about how beautiful life was in her village in Swat ,then the second part is about life under the Taliban with no schools for girls,no music,wearing the Burka etc and the third part is about her recovery and life in Birmingham.<br /><br />The political side is a bit complicated and you can lose interest as there are so many organisations and ACROMYN which mean little to me.<br /><br />She was interviewed on TV which caused me to take interest in her book. Being 16 she is so mature and well spoken.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I don't care whether there are many inaccuracies or not, I strongly believe even with all the inaccuracies fixed, I won't get a very different painting on Amazon.<br /><br />The book is definitely not a full biography of Jeff Bezos, but it is for Amazon. The idea is about Amazon and then Bezos, simply because the author did not directly interview Bezos for this book (there are many indirect past interviews though), but the author did source first-hand information from almost everyone in Amazon (including the alumnus) but not Bezos.<br /><br />The book touched every department and the involved people in extreme details. By the time you finished the book, you might thought that you have worked in Amazon for 2 decades. Also, you can clearly feel the tense and the very harsh way Bezos treated his staff.<br /><br />Although I disagree on how Bezos manages his people (not Amazon), be it employees or suppliers, he is--without any slight doubt--one of the most intelligent entrepreneurs ever lived. His unconventional and long-term thinking is the main reason of how Amazon getting into what it is today. Despite of his &#34;poor&#34; management on people (you will read about someone leaving Amazon every 3 pages), he managed his customers perfectly.<br /><br />Just pick this book up!

B00846REIS|3.0|It was ok, I felt like it was a poor emulation of 50 shades, and was way too similar, I couldn't help but prepare the two the whole time while reading
159463176X|5.0|We read this for my bookclub, and everyone loved it. I have read his other works, which I thought were good, but this was by far my favorite. The story telling aspect of this book is phenomenal. Each &#34;chapter&#34; focuses on different characters, which all relate back to each other in some way or another. Normally I find the constant switching of characters to be quite jarring in books, but Khaled Hosseini does a wonderful job. A story would begin and before I knew it I would be completely enthralled. Then the chapter would be over and I would be left wanting more, so I could stay with the characters I had just come to love.  However, despite my hesitation to start anew with each character, their new story would in turn sweep me up and the cycle would begin again. In the end,  I feel the broad range of characters told a larger, more richer story than if it had been focused round a smaller few. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Colleen and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It really does have a huge twist in the storyline which you do not see coming.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|What more can I say other than this is the best film adaptation of this book ever. Perfect?  Not close, Outstanding?  Absolutely! You can read the other reviews here for the nuances of the characterizations, script, cinematography,  and how they compare to other versions. I'll simply say this is just plan good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great novel. Wonderful follow-up to A Time to Kill.  We revisit the town and the lawyer from that novel, and are introduced to new characters.  The question asked is why did Seth Hubbard, a universally hated resident of Ford County, leave the bulk of his considerable estate to his black maid and omit his own children?  The answer is as satisfying as it is surprising.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is sssoooo AWESOME! I highly suggest getting it! It is so worth the money! No glitches, and its fun for ANY age!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Every book is a better page turner than the last. George R.R. Martin has done no wrong so far in regards to these books.

B001BZRUR4|5.0|If we could all have someone to orchestrate doing the right thing - for others, our friends, ourselves - what a wonderful world this would be.  Maybe we can.  That's the beauty in this book: living up to our highest potential.  Thank you for this lovely book.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I was only interested in this because it was a free app of the day, I was hooked from the start, and even more so after I realized you could tap on the texts to make the story go by faster.  This is a fun time passer and will be looking forward to more !

B00GS1DM2S|5.0|Evangelion 3.0, in my opinion, is the most enjoyable of the three rebuild movies so far in the four part movie series. I guess one reason is because it was a film I wasn't expecting. In the last two Rebuild movies, most fans of the original series, like myself, already knew what to expect as their stories unfolded. The first rebuild move 1.0 covers the first 6 episodes of the original T.V series. The second movie does seem to take a different direction in some parts of the story, but overall uses the same plot elements from the latter half of the T.V series to help tell its story. While the movie was good, it didn't seem to work as a film, since it was treated more live its T.V counterpart, and the pacing of the film seemed to be too fast as the director was trying to add too much information into the film, which failed to set an overall tone. Evangelion 3.0 however, sets a tone for its audience right away that is so effective and mesmerizing to the viewer where he or she cant look away from the screen for a second. *Warning: the rest of this review contains spoilers to the film's overall plot. If you want to avoid spoilers, try to avoid the rest of this review if you'd like. What I will tell you though is that if you are one of those people who prefer answers right away and value a lot of character interaction, this may not be the movie for you. This movie leaves you with a lot of questions for you to think about and to guess as to what happened in the story. Some of the behaviors of certain characters are also different that the viewer may not like due to the events that take place in the film, which needs to be addressed for those who hold some of the characters dear to them. So without further ado, here is the rest of the review...........<br /><br />The story takes place 14 years after 3rd impact was avoided. Our main protagonist awakes inside a dark ship, where he finds his former guardian, Misato Katsuragi, as the captain of an anti-Nerv organization called Will-E. Their goal, as stated by Misato later in the movie, is to stop her former organization Nerv from preventing future Impacts from occurring. However what's so striking and captivating about the opening scene is how everyone seems to have a sense of hatred for Shinji. As he starts to ask questions about the past, he is treated with silence and looks of disgust from everyone on board. The environment feels as if Shinji is on the lowest level of Dante's hell itself. Was Shinji's desperate act of heroism to save Rei in the last film, the real reason as to why the whole world is wrecked beyond repair? Who knows?<br /><br />After the battleship Wunder successfully defeats the angel in the ocean. Shinji is again treated like crap from everyone on board. Even Asuka, the one girl he seemed to care for, has an unknown grudge against him, as she attempts to punch him through a glass wall. Did Shinji's actions alsso seem to have a bad impact on her. Once again, who knows? The fact that we as an audience know so little about the past and the effects it had on the people around him, icrease our intrigue in the film, as we demand to know these answers. Later on, Shinji is rescued by the woman he believed he saved, Rei, and is taken back to the old ruins of Nerv. These ruins seem to be hell itself, as there is no lush of life, or anything inhabiting the old headquarters. They seem to be decaying in structure, and are stained in red. However one area of the ruins seems to be full of life, as it contains a boy, a piano, and a plant full of life.<br /><br />Shinji quickly quickly befriends this boy known as Kaworu, as they bond by learning how to play the beautiful tune &#34;Ode to Joy&#34; Shinji also tries to talk to Rei, but seems to have no chance, as she doesn't remember anything about Shinji or what she did in the past. This leads to Shinji relying on Kaworu, as he appears to be his only chance at finding peace. However Kaworu cannot hide the truth of Shinji's past actions,as he shows Shinji the horrifying aftermath of the 3rd Impact he started. While Shinji does seem to be affected drastically by his actions. Kaworu later offers him the chance to redo the past by joining him in piloting an Eva.<br /><br />The most tantalizing element of this movie is the lost hope and despair Shinji feels as he is revealed little by little about how much worse he has made the world. The tone is captured just right, and the pacing is just perfect as it lets the movie tell the story itself through Shinji's perspective. Add to that a great musical score composed by Shirô Sagisu, along with great camerawork and lighting, this film is a fun and engaging experience for any fan that wants something different. While the film leaves many questions unanswered, it does help set up for an exciting fourth and final installment.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|First, this contains spoilers!!! Second, I enjoyed the trilogy, especially the first two. I would recommend the book and I wasn't really disappointed until the ending. I agree with some of the other reviews that after reading the ending it just brought down my day. I really get into my books and once the main character, tris, died and four found out I cried through the end. I just wonder why she couldn't have been severely injured but still survived. You tend to read books I get away from your own drama or problems for a little while and the ending just really ruined my day.<br /><br />Other than that I would have given it 5 stars.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|I don't write many movie reviews, but of the many John Wayne movies I've seen, this is probably the best. It has great acting by all of the principles, but best of all is the writing. The story is interesting. The dialog is witty. In fact, some one-liners are downright funny. A great balance of action with drama. And who wouldn't love Mitchum as a drunk?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I played the original Casteville, so of course I was excited about this one. While it is as almost as enjoyable, I wish game play went a little faster and collecting coins to buy thing didn't take so long.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! So damn good. This was such a good book on so many levels. I laughed and I cried (a lot). Once I started reading I just couldn't stop. Oh my heart. Just thinking about what happened makes me want to cry but it was such a good read.<br /><br />I &#60;3 Holder.
6305076995|5.0|Quality schmality this is one great dvd. My only complaint is that I wish they had captured the whole yessongs album. If you truly appreciate brilliant musicians this dvd is going to be one great feast for you. I have all the studio albums and I still prefer the live versions on yessongs best. Considering the archaic recording equipment used for these concerts the quality is excellent. It is just so good to see your favorite songs performed live by your favorite musicians. I first saw this movie when it came out at the local cinema and have hunted it down ever since. I was convinced that I would never see it again. I'm not sucking up but a huge special thanks to Amazon for making one of my wants a reality. All I can suggest is BUY BUY BUY this dvd a definate must for any Yes fan and a great rock concert for anyone who loves their music
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|I was hoping for great and got very good. Ragnar's mannerisms made me a bit uncomfortable in the last few episodes. It was too much like Floki; just a bit too odd. Otherwise, it was the overall composition was impressive. The disc menus (Blueray) were nice too.

B007XWFZSA|5.0|Victor explains the skills required for tackling interviews with management consultancies. He does it in a crystal clear manner, and the book is quite enjoyable to read. It opens my eyes to this industry and the analytical skills that it values.<br /><br />I am not a consultant, but I can see how these skills can be extremely handy in my own profession. Topics covered includes:<br />1. The two core skills required: math and case analysis.<br />2. The two main types of case interviews: interviewer led and interviewee led.<br />3. The most commonly used frameworks for analyzing a case.<br />4. How to present an analysis in a professional manner.<br />5. How to prepare for a management consultant interview.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved this book.  Rowell's ability to painstakingly describe the mixture of emotions one feels in the throes of young love is unparalleled (see also Eleanor & Park).  I literally gasped &#34;No!&#34; when I turned the last page and realized it was over - I wanted to stay in that world with those characters for a little bit longer.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I'm feeling all sorts of weepy right now and I'm just not ready for it to be over. This was a great finish to a truly amazing series. I've grown to really like and admire these characters and I'm happy with the way things ended for them all. I am just a greedy person and want more. I'm not ready to say goodbye.
B00G4EXNNM|4.0|This is a very interesting collaboration.  Although I was skeptical at first, Armstrong and Jones' voices mesh well together.  Armstrong's voice is very sweet, while Jones' is earnest, and they float well over the piano and guitar music.  The result is very easy to listen to.<br /><br />That being said, the lyrics on this album are incredibly depressing.  It's not headphone listening.  You do not want to hear every word, unless you like being sad.  It's good stereo or car music, where there are distractions from the fact that someone dies in half the songs.  Overall, though, I recommend it.  It is very beautiful, in spite of the lyrics.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Love the move but then I fell in love with Fantasy/SciFi with this book.  Good interpretation of the book with all the stunning scenery.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Quite enjoyable on a very technical subject.  Builds on a firm foundation of the Standard Model and how the discovery filled a gap.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging. Can't wait for more levels!!  Recommended to friends and family. Really worth giving a try...it's free...can't beat that!
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|Works every time!  I'll never go to sleep without it, again.  Unless, of course, I get sick of hearing his voice, in which case, I'll purchase someone else's!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|The game lets you get to a certain level then holds you there until you buy your way out. I refuse to break out my credit card so I guess this is it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|interesting way to train one's brain-eyes to recognize patterns, and to manipulate objects. One can create images anticipating results and gain some control.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a wonderful app jjjjjjjjhjhhhhhhbbnnbvhbb gvfvw defect the most important thing you want but I don't want him and I don't know how
B001IWV030|5.0|Enjoyed the characters and the dialog. A really great forum and format  for the stars of the movie<br />humerous film
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This is the same basic Nevosoft hidden object game.  If you have played one before, then you should know exactly what to expect.  It is the same HO game every time, just with new dialogue.  It's not a bad game at all, it's just getting very repetitious.  Easily recommended as a FAOTD.
B00CKKDZ2S|2.0|It's somewhat &#34;stupid&#34;.  Don't know what I was thinking, glad it was free!  It only covers yesterday and today, if you wish to find out about tomorrow, it costs $$$.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is a great game.  My kids love angry birds and Star Wars, so this is a great product.  I have it on my iPhone and have gotten three stars on all levels.  It is challenging enough.  Not too difficult but then not too easy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|We are enjoying this book so much with my son. These are great life lessons for my 8 year old...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love that I can now play on my Kindle. I have been stuck on level 350 a LONG time!! Help!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Great story with Grisham's usual humor, suspense and interesting characters.  Read this book on my Kindle in a matter of days, couldn't put it away until done.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I is so much better than the regular Castle Ville. Cool graphics for a little game. It almost seems 3D.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|the second one is soooo much better than the first by A LOT, i recomend this one if you like the first one.
B00D7OXUIK|3.0|The music is great and would rate a  5 because these are great performances. But the digital information for disk 2 is in japanese. Nice job ECM.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game I love it gets addicting an actually gets really hard! I will recomend this game to everyone I know!  best game on Amazon market forsure! really easy to learn and fun for the whole family?!!
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|The download is free but you have to buy credit to play. So, basically, it is not true that it is free.
B00FFVLYTU|5.0|Broadchurch is one of those shows that can get absolutely nothing wrong. The actors are brilliant, the director is brilliant, the writers are brilliant, the cinematographers are brilliant, the composer is brilliant. Just everything is perfect. If you try this, you will not be disappointed.
B004PYWRQC|3.0|The movie was shot in a typical Roman Polanski style, with good camera work, and Johnny Depp and his colleagues put on an admirable performance, however, the plot itself was a bit on the weak side.  It was an enjoyable film, but not one I would recommend whole-heartedly.
B00FMFEA68|2.0|I am not even sure if it deserves 2 stars.  But given that one star is &#34;I hate it&#34; - and I don't like to think I hate anything- and I did finish it.<br />This book is an egotistical rant with lots of very pointed revenge.  I got tired of the repetitive whinge about why he didn't get to No 1 in the Chart and seemed to blame everyone except maybe that it just wasn't good enough ! !  Several very tiring pages (about 50) where he recounts the court case following the breakup of The Smiths.  And throughout the book, constant reference to various poets and authors as if he needed to let us know that he knew they existed.  I think Penguin have definitely discredited the concept of 'Classic' .  Would not recommend anyone buying it - you will find it in bargain basements and charity shops soon.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Interesting, entertaining and extremely heartfelt.  I really felt for the characters and could not stop reading always wondering how their stories would end.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesomeffjfdjdjdjdjd. Chechens adds Dr s d dad's real number was and guess it in your room on a texting you sounding board members to get the country music louder and you should come to church camp and the sacredness the sticks out and mocked to be funny pictures in your chair but you
B00D1XDCKS|5.0|Simply put, I love the movie. I've seen it multiple times since I purchased it. Robert Downey Jr. was awesome as usual. He's gonna be the face of Iron Man for a very long time.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|The music on this record is timeless. This record was worth the wait! You will NOT be disappointed. Love it!!!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Excellent movie.  I had already seen it, but really wanted to share it with my husband.  It's worth seeing more than once.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Great at casting the likes of Hulu and Netflix, but the lack of cast from Chrome on Android and MacOS make it far less useful that we had hoped. Google need to rectify that and open up the API so that apps for casting the whole screen from smartphones and tablets can be developed and supported.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pretty cool app if you are a Pinterest fan. On my Kindle Fire it is a little difficult to pin stuff but better than having no Pinterest at all!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really good. Enjoyed a lot. Recommended it to anyone. I . Played it all the time. Couldn't be happier with an app
B00003CY0V|5.0|You have a combination of old Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, and Don Cheadle and one should expect an awesome, action-packed explosive thrilling movie. Add computer hacking and terrorism and you have the whole package.<br />Awesome movie.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I love the mystery in this game hours of family fun. It took me a minute to get it when I first played it but, what I realized is that this game works well to get your brain going. You will really enjoy it.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I don't know why The NY Times had such a good review for it. It's little more than fan fiction posted on a Jane Austen board. There was such a lack of consistency of character for every person & far too many inconsequential details about characters we never even meet. Further, there were a few lines taken directly from the original which was disruptive to the flow of the novel instead of being natural. It was certainly not a well-edited book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|easy read. enjoyed the story. kind of knew where it was going except at the end. wanted more so will read next inline
B0055JPM6I|2.0|This would have been a great kids movie ...<br />Accept for it's graphic penis references<br />Seriously this movie could have made a ton of money for year to come<br />But they had to yuck it up ... Danny McBride in my opinion is a looser end of story!
B00005JPS8|5.0|I love the Iron Man series. While I'm predominantly a DC comics fan, Iron Man (and The Avengers as a group) really hit the jackpot with me. I wouldn't mind seeing the movie again and again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have 29 years of experience with law and it's workings in the Deep South.  Grisham's characters are realistic with a story line that keeps one wanting more. Love a story with an unpredictable but believable ending.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is amazing better then most console hunting games don't think just download anyone who likes hunting or shooting Will love this game the slow mo<br /> Kill shots just add to awesomeness of this game very good app.<br /><br />BoDeezy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun game ! I love the fact that you get the mystery boxes and coins! Love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is good for creative people (or contractors :) it is sort of like playing with virtual legos... I usually play creative version just so I can build structures.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I cannot do much justice to this movie. This series is simply one of Bruce Willis' best. This movie is bound to become a classic.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is the best its a challenge but really fun my grandma showed me the game and I just love it!!!!!!!!<br />loving it ;) !!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham always tells a great story and this one brings up some things from history that I had not considered previously.  The book kept me reading up to the end.  That is always a good thing!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this game, I love Mahjong games.  You have a series of backgrounds, and games to choose from.  It is so much fun and the faster you go, the more fun it is.  Try it, it has colored tiles to choose from also.  I believe you will like this one.
B005USZYDU|1.0|I am confused I read as far as allowed but it was not the end of story!!! Where is the rest of my book ?? This has never happened before and I do not know how to get the rest of the my book
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|I have to say that I watched all 3 of the US broadcasts of this episode. I LOVED it. I laughed I cried it had a perfect ending. I was ok with Eccleston not being in the show as we saw him in the Night episode.<br /><br />Steven Moffat you are amazing and I finished watching this being satisfied. I can't wait to purchase the DVD so I can watch it over and over and share it too.
B00GO95BUU|1.0|Adding my voice to the price outrage.<br /><br />I logged in early this morning and saw the Standard Edition at $2.99.  I gave in and ran over to Bing to have my points redeemed for a $3 Amazon Gift Card, only to return to the show page and have it tell me the price was $4.99 for the Standard Edition!<br /><br />Now I see it's jumped yet again in 12 hours.<br /><br />What's more upsetting is that I'm a Amazon Prime member.  Although it would have been nice to see a free streaming version, and I know day-after releases usually don't have free-streaming, it would STILL have been nice if we Amazon Prime members were NOT treated in this manner, let alone how the rest of the faithful Amazon customers have been treated.  You DO realize that this becomes a part of a decision whether  or not to renew Prime membership, right?
0764137433|5.0|This book is amazing-while taking Russian 101, I got confused with verb endings but this book does it all.  Great purchase.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Oh my goodness....I love my cat.  I named him  AFRICA  He is the sweetest little kitten.  I am a grandmother and I talk to this cat!! Can you imagine that I love doing that and he purrs like a real kitten.  I love to feed him and he doesn't even require  cleaning out a litter box.  You will love this game and it is a relaxing one.  Any age can play this one.Amazon you have done it again...So good I give it a plus 5. Make sure you put him to sleep every night.  He loves his bed.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Well written like all of McEwan's work. The characters were developed wiyth his usual skill. The twist in the ending was masterfully underplayed.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A page turner to the end but still a couple of convenient final chapter character changes.  Also one person unaccounted for.  One has to wonder if this was to have been a series if four books.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|I like Hidden object games. So this is a fun way to destress.  If you like that try this one.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Refuses to work ie cannot  get into its own file storage. Keeps  telling me  to try again. Much too frustrating.
0743298039|4.0|When I bought The Thirteenth Tale, it was on a whim. All I knew of it was the title and that it had won a few awards. I didn’t know what it was about until I read the back cover. A book about book lovers has to be great, right?<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was the beautiful language. Diane Setterfield knows her way around a sentence. I enjoyed the story and the plot kept me turning the pages. The characters were intriguing and there was just enough mystery to hold my attention without pushing me toward frustration.<br /><br />The omniscience of the narrator was unusual for me, particularly because a mystery is at the center of the story. Having (limited) insight into each of the characters thoughts was disconcerting at times. The setting is obviously historical, but the reader never learns the exact time period. That annoyed me a bit.<br /><br />The twists at the end were very satisfying, but I felt the story ended before the book did. The narrator didn't want the reader to wonder what happened to the secondary characters. I found it unnecessary and a bit excessive.<br /><br />On the whole, The Thirteenth Tale is a very good book and I recommend it to fans of mystery and literary fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the first 2 movies before reading this book and they made me want to read the series because of how good they were and I figured that if the movies were good then the books would be as well and I have to say that I was wrong..the books were fantastic and I couldn't put them down! I'm not really much of a book person but I read these in just a few days and I'd read them again in a heartbeat
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|I like eminem's new album, glad he's still goin at it. Here's another up and coming white rapper Sammy Ray goes pretty ham http://youtu.be/nXqN0QjcOnE
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was very skeptical and had long assumed that this was twilight with a different dust jacket, but boy was I wrong.  The plot is gripping and well explained, and the author has a knack for showing true emotion in her characters. More than once I floated back to being sixteen and thought to myself, &#34;oh yeah, I remember that feeling.&#34;  If you enjoy literature, dystopian literature in particular, put your preconceived notions aside and give this book a try, you won't regret it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really good game. Good if you just need to kill time. And is actually FREE. You only have to bay for more bananas, and coins, but only if u want to. You can collect them...anyway, really good game.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Love In The Future is definitely music for lovers and the soul... John Legend delivered yet another fabulous album that I love to listen to in its entirety. I lost my husband earlier this year and find that Love In The Future reflects my process of healing the lover inside of me. Open Your Eyes pays homage to relationship endings and beginnings, with an upbeat tempo and soulful vocals of Legend that kind of makes &#34;rebound love&#34; a little more accepting and attractive... I guess (lol) Hold On Longer also inspires and caresses the dark nights of love, while Wanna Be Love is the classic Legend I absolutely love. I was intrigued with Asylum's overall composition and the &#34;ball and chains&#34; background music in Caught Up. Legend did it again and will continue to support his musical genuineness.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is an excellent history book  that details events and figures of the 1920's, culminating in the summer of 1927. The stories vary enough that you can experience several different events during one reading session. Fantastic!
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Wonderful and straight-forward explanation of all aspects of negotiation. I plan to use this text in my negotiating course for law enforcement.
B00AFPVPDG|5.0|I loved the range of skills that Josh demonstrated and how he went about acquiring them.<br /><br />Really a great blueprint to not only acquire skills, but how to decompose them.<br /><br />My strategy for acquiring skills has been to jump in, grab a heap of books about the subject, or do a course etc. Without planning, without researching the best tools and resources first to establish leverage points.<br /><br />Which is probably why I have 3 floor to ceiling bookcases overflowing with things I wanted to learn.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun for all ages you mite have to wait for stuff to grow but its Definitively worth the time. Easy fun very addicting
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It was fun to revisit these characters, and their stories, but I found the story to be too depressing.<br /><br />An awful lot of the story focused on the main character's struggle with alcohol abuse, which made this book largely the story of a sad and pathetic drunk, rather than the story of a powerful psychic.<br /><br />I really can't understand how you could have such incredible psychic powers, and just squander them away the way Daniel Torrence does.  Not that helping people pass on isn't noble, but it seems to me so much more could be done with it.<br /><br />In any case, the chase and the battle were fun and suspenseful.  And I was reminded of The Stand, as supernatural powers were used to save the world.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This heart warming story of a postmistress and two communities portrays life.<br />Well done, great setting, characters you can love.
B0089XH38M|5.0|GOOD protection . 5-star protection !  thanks for keeping this good software free. keep up the good work. very good at catching App-s which promote PUSH ad ( advertisements ) .  Please Amazon update to the latest version of AVG Antivirus Security: [ 3.4.0.1 ] for the moment i had to go to alternative market place to download the latest version . good and easy to operate program interface. multi language support and interface. you don' t have to follow the cleaning of the unneeded app-s by AVG. you can clean or remove the suspicious app-s afterwards from the Application Manager on your Android phone just by restricting the push up messages or un-installing the app.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Brilliant and useful book. Didn't think I had a fixed mindset, but realized there are some areas I do. Like thinking I don't have what it takes to be a great designer or programmer so haven't put in the real hard yards. Like throwing in the towel before the fight has even started.<br /><br />Also some areas I wouldn't have thought of like in relationships - thought my social skills were limited - that I didn't have the same potential as people who had &#34;the gift of the gab&#34;<br /><br />Overall I found I believed my potential was limited in certain fields, so I should focus on my &#34;strengths&#34;. As someone was quoted in the book - how can anyone possibly know what someones potential is or could be.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|I gave it to my father as a gift & he loves it......still working his way through all the discs
0385537131|5.0|I started this book and couldn't stop until the end, a truly great story and complements A Time to Kill,,one off my favorite books.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great read. Couldn't put it down and hated for it to end. Would make a perfect book club choice. Lots to discuss!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is the best game in the world you should have this game it is so much fun !
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Needed some extras so that I could alleviate moving these from vehicle to vehicle.  I have used these on two extended trips and extensively around town with no issues noted. Would purchase again.
098478280X|5.0|Good book for code interview. Elementary book you should have.Start your code interview with this book and won't let you down
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun but quite difficult to play through a touch-only interface, and I end up dying far too often as a result of the interface limitations. The night display is too dark for me to see anything if I'm playing under normal room lighting.<br /><br />It has taken me forever to understand how some of it works, but that is possibly age handicapping.<br /><br />The game has never locked up or glitched on my Kindle Fire, so I'll give it four stars for showing me what all the fuss was about.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a terrific series to get hooked on.  Although some would say, children killing other children is not such a good plot line.  However fighting against an evil, so called government is.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I played it on my cousins phone and decided to get it on my kindle.  it turns out I have made a great decision
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the best novel I have read this year. It holds your suspense throughout the entire book. Many twists and turns throughout the book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great way to pass some time. A lot of fun. Good choice of characters. You have to smile while playing.
1433537427|5.0|This is a very nice Bible.  The quality is amazing.  The only complaint I have is that the print is very small, but then again it has to be to fit all of this study information into a manageable size.  All-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This was a good read, until it started to repeat and was more of a story about Malala's father and history of the country. She is a very strong girl to have lived the life she has in such a country.
B00GWEPPE4|1.0|4th season is so boring, I'll watch one more and if it doesn't get any better I'm going to drop it.
B008JFUPFI|2.0|I gave it a 2 because the acting was good. But when did Superman become a liar and a theif? That is not who Superman is or what he stands for. My husband love the Superman comics and he just exploded over what they did to you.Hoolywood should stop changing up the goodness in people so they don't look so bad. give the kids someone to strive to be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool. Keeps you havi n g so m ethi n g to do. Comoetitions and stuff. Only get if you like horses
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have this game on my phone and was pleased to finally have it for kindle. It's simple, addictive fun. My whole family loves it. Five stars!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just love Katniss and all the characters in this book that moves so fast.  After devouring the fist in the series, had to go on and see what happened.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an absolutely terrific game. It is very relaxing because it is so easy to use. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B0036T31YY|5.0|Extremely well done film.  This movie begins simply enough but descends into mystery and chaos progessing to a point where I could not see how the author could possibly reconcile the plot.  Deeply engaging plot, well acted and cinematographically beautiful.  As the film progressed, I became increasingly engaged and enthralled with the seemingly impossible ireconcilable plot.  But the author connects all the plot lines into a shocking singular conclusion, revealing the underlying hopelessness of this intriguingly sinister film.  While I might ordinarily define this film as &#34;evil,&#34; it is only evil in that it evokes the deep, desparate, and hopeless panic and pain experienced at the very core of one's being as the result of losing a child.  I don't want to share too much about this movie, but if you do not have a strong heart and mind, don't watch it - the ending will pull your heart to pieces.<br /><br />One of the best films I've ever endured.
0762449306|5.0|I just got this it was on back order.  They were real good about keeping in touch with me .  The book had all the 12 Doctor's in it and  I like the light up tardis.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've loved it it's been a first book in forever that I have read that I have enjoyed<br /> The book is so detailed and wonderfully written
B003O86FMW|5.0|Our library is under reconstruction, so had to purchase this to re-read it for the third time. It is just one of those books worth re-reading for me.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!! DICAPRIO IS AMAZING IN ALL OF HIS MOVIES! AND NEVER LETS HIS FANS DOWN!! great for a sunday with the family
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|Got this game to replace real racing.  It keeps crashing when I go to race.  Wasted money on a kindle fire HD.  Stick with real racing, don't waste your time or money.
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|From the dramatic beginning, through the emotions involved in violent death, through the ripples of suspicion and doubt that tear a community apart, to the incredibly moving ending, this is simply an amazing show, well acted, well presented, broken up with gorgeous, gorgeous natural settings -- just amazingly good.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|Absolutely super duper for Clapton lovers! You can hear him, and then hear and watch him. Had no idea how much was in the package
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book even for younger kids, shows that people shouldn't get what they want, can't control you. The Hunger Games shows how much of the world is really there, how evil things are. \\"Evil is a war that must be fought, but can never be won.\\"<br /><br />  -AD
B008JFUUIA|5.0|great movie!! can watch this 100+ times and not get sick of it!! anna kendrick is perfect for this role and she did a great job!! shipped very fast to my house!
B001LM1456|3.0|the movie was entertaining and fascinating for a superheros story. The quality of the movie and the movie sets is pretty cool. It definitely needs to have a sequel, though.
B008602KQI|1.0|Why doesn't the sound work? I've tried everything to get it to work, updates etc, and still no sound. Help!
B00GINENG0|2.0|It's good but ever since I got this game my kindle started freezing when I go online,play games and other stuff I like to do. It looks so cute but when you get to level 2 it starts to freezers lot. Live of junk .don't get it every other talking animal friend is good. WHEn I firs saw this I got it but it froze right away.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|A very satisfying story, reasonably well acted, without any big-name actors, but with great real estate--both high and low--and landscapes.
B000TXNDUW|3.0|God this movie has some dumb moments, but it is known for a reason. This is a highly influential movie that I suggest watching if you plan on filming or studying the art of cinema. If not than this movie won't be as enjoyable.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|This was a great action movie.  Technologically better than the original Judge Dredd.  The only downside to this one was the fact that they tried making Dredd's face look like Stallone with that downturned grimace.  That grimace was so overacted that it distracted from an otherwise kickass movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love love love this app!!! It is the best thing you could hope for when you want to train for taking care of a real horse.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Can charge iPhone 5 about 4 times, yet packs small.  Holds a charge if unused for a great while too.  I carry it with me in my man bag every day.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I've heard it works great for Netflix and a few other services, but I bought it in order to stream from Chrome on my laptop. In that aspect this is terrible.<br />* The video loses sync with the audio occasionally<br />* The video pauses for several frames at times<br />* The audio is jittery at times<br /><br />When I switch back to playing from my laptop, everything is great again. I then switch back to Chromecast, and it's broken.<br /><br />Unless google fixes this with an update, I would say don't buy if you want to stream tabs from your browser.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Omg dis app is soooooooooooooooooooooooo cool I luv luv luv it! Every thing is sooooooo awesome except u have to pay fir him to fart and eat a bird but u can talk and he repeats and u can give him milk and u can make him scratch DA screen and make a recording and slap him in DA face and poke him and pet him  and he will always be sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo kewt!! :)
B00005JOA0|4.0|When I first watched this movie it was right after I read the book.  The intense scenes and Tara Fitzgerald's severe persona and period hairstyle were less palatable at that time.  However, I stumbled upon the movie a few years later and found it less audacious especially when I fast forwarded through the \\"rough\\" parts.  It is well acted and worth venturing into at least once or maybe twice with editing.

B009APMNB0|5.0|The big selling point of this calibrator, for me, is that it's low-cost yet still allows you to calibrate multiple monitors on the same computer.  Most other calibrators only allow that feature on their more expensive models, so it was refreshing to see that was possible, since multi-monitor setups are so common now.<br /><br />My monitors were already calibrated when I got this item..or so I thought.  After calibrating the monitor with the ColorMunki Smile, I switched back and forth between profiles, and realized that the old calibrator (Spyder4Pro) left my monitor with a slightly sickly-green tint.  It was subtle enough to not notice, but switching back and forth it was clear that the Smile did a better job.<br /><br />It's not all perfect, it's missing a few features that users may need so check its specs to make sure it does what you want.  On a couple monitors I had to calibrate twice because the first time was clearly way off.  Not sure what happened there but it looked great after going through calibration an extra time, so I'm happy.

006202406X|1.0|I've never thought this series was very good. The writing was hallow and juvenille, the plotline dry, the characters unrelatable, the struggles far-fetched. And this book proved to be the icing on the cake. I kept expecting the series to get better, especially with such an interesting concept and its great setting. But I have gotten nothing but disappointment back from this. I think Veronica Roth should have revised and edited several more times before being allowed to be published. Don't let this book series shape your idea of YA fiction! There are some truly excellent novels out there, and this is not one of them. It isn't even good. It's just crap.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan from way back and still love the original.  I enjoyed having these movies on an updated format so I can enjoy them again and again.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Haven't watched it yet but a great deal for this acclaimed motion picture. We will be watching it this week. Almost as cheap as renting. I buy only oscar nominated films for my collection.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Started slow with too many characters for my liking but was thoroughly pleased when the main story took hold. Loved the ending.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's so much fun to play. You create your own Dragon park and breed them in the breeding hut and it tells you what Dragon to breed to make a new one over all its fun free and is safe for all ages
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|was supremely challenging on the small screen of a kindle. otherwise I enjoyed the layered style and variety of interactive puzzles

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|The best movie.  Love all the characters and the story line.  Very good acting. Loved Chris Pine & Urban as the young Krk.and Dr. McCoy.
B00170MYIS|3.0|After about a year of occasional use, it's not holding a charge as well as the much older batteries that came with our cameras.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When someone told me about this game i thought it was going to be one of those fads. But when i played it i really liked it. And i play it SO much but never get tired of it.
B00F88H5K2|4.0|movie was a little creepy but well acted.  Micheal Douglas and Matt Damon were amazing.  you will be shocked to see Rob Lowe.This movie is not for the faint of heart.  it is graphic
B005MTHRAA|5.0|To get to see La Divina at work is worth the various directorial vagaries.  Maria Callas deserved a better movie than Pasolini gave her.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|i am a huge fan of fantasy stories and drizzt is my favorite charactar as R.A. Salvatore is my favorite author.  he does a great job describing combat and anything else that needs description.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The story unfolded slowly picking up speed as it climaxed with the answer to why a Mississippi man wrote an unusual & unexpected will bequeathing 90 per cent of his substantial fortune to his black housekeeper.  Grisham leads the reader through a fascinating probate proceeding with surprising, gripping revelations. An excellent read
B008VBYN80|4.0|So far really fun.  I hope it stays that way for awhile to come..and this review I know sucks<br /><br />But I don't like doing these

B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is okay...instructions are rather vague and the never-ending FB posts are annoying.  I am playing it a little longer to see where it goes.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Do you like minions?<br />Well if you do I highly recommend you to get Minion Rush. It's fun and makes you excited. I'm a kid and its really fun, so I'm sure if your a grown up and secretly a fan of minions it's a perfect game for you!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush I play it everywhere I go at school at home in the case I just love this game ....&lt;3
B000001EGE|4.0|I remember Honky Chateau from college.  Lively songs, great musicians, excellent production.<br />Honky Chateau is just as good 40 years later.<br />Forty years later ???  Yikes, am I finally getting old ???
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|No longer works since November. Pages can no longer be opened using the kindle fire. Required plug in does not load. Useless app now.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Great new music!  All the music on this album is good.  This album did not disappoint me!  I am impressed.

B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|My son is 3.  He LOVES this book.  He almost has it memorized by now.  And voices over some of the characters.  Its hilarious.  Highly entertaining.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I think this is the best sleep aid I have found. it has do many different sounds and choices that you can make.  you can customize your own sounds by choosing more than on sound and you can adjust the level of each sound you add. I also love the auto timer and program shut down after timer ends so no drained battery.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|The medical and scientific aspects are very intriguing to me.  This book keeps one guessing right up to the very end.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It is easy to use and very intuitive, It is free and I use it and would recommend it to a others.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Allows me to go back and forth between Facebook and my kindle to play. Love it<br />Minimal differences between the two.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Would love to rate this better, but it wouldn't download at all. This would be a great app to use on the run. Disappointed.
B00FLDG5BE|3.0|The 2007 festival is still the best by far. The musicians that showed up for that one came with the gloves off and started yanking and cranking. 2013 is better than 2010 but there is still to much acoustic lullaby stuff. The allman bros., Keith Richards, los lobos, and Clapton electric guitar performances are the best things to watch on this dvd. I like to see axe masters like jeff beck, doyle bramhall, and john mayer come out whaling away like in 2007. This doesn't happen. I found myself fast forwarding a lot.
B000GOY3I0|4.0|Great classic, entertaining and a good 80s flick. Recommend to anyone interested in a smart and clever kids comedy adventure.
1551525143|5.0|Beautiful story. It touched me at my very core and I could not put it down. The art is detailed and amazing. I love the color contrasts as well. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
0545626382|5.0|I got this in meant condition through Amazon. Anyone interested in a culturally relevant, drama-filled, and thought provoking literature will find it right here in Collins' trilogy.  As I am writing my senior thesis on the trilogy, I may be a bit biased, but it truly is a good read and worth every penny.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|A great story that moved along at a good clip.  I had never seen Twin Peaks, and after reading it, I started thinking about old Twilight Zone episodes.  This book was truly a fun read.  The only complaint I have, and it's a minor beef - was the occasional bad grammar.  A few sentence fragments here and there, and a few sentences where the reader had to assume the subject of the sentence (was it to much extra effort to type the word 'he')?  That aside, this was a fun read.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I finally bought this after having their greatest hits cd for years. Im so glad I did. There is music on this that I didn't know about. This album is really good.
034580404X|3.0|It's definitely an interesting story line.  I'm more drawn to the psychological piece of the story then the &#34;other&#34; allure to this book. The Crossfire series and the Breathless Trilogy are much better in &#34;that&#34; area, plus the intrigue of a a good story line.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is much better than Season 1,  my wife and I hated for the season to end,  well written and not cheesy like a lot of shows now days.
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|&#34;Did you bring a horse for me ?&#34;<br /><br />&#34;It looks like we're -- we're shy one horse.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;You brought two too many...&#34;<br /><br />Charles Bronson. Jason Robards. Henry Fonda. Claudia Cardinale. Jack Elam. Woody Strode. Keenan Wynn...Sergio Leone's, &#34;Once Upon A Time In The West.&#34;<br /><br />A veritable classic.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I'm half way through with the book, I love it so far and feel confident it will only get better. I want to finish before the movie comes out.
B001223BLU|5.0|awesome music .. brings back many wonderful memories.  We recently went to &#34;Jersey Boys,&#34; that's what prompted me to purchase this album
B004HO6I2E|4.0|Why isn't the soundtrack for sale?  I would totally buy it.  Funny movie, a bit over the top with raunch, glad I watched it cleaned up a bit on tv, but I still liked it.  I wasn't going to watch it because I'm tired of the &#34;switched&#34; mind/body story line, but it made me sit down and watch it.  I want the soundtrack all easy and ready to download.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she put it together in 30 minute. She likes the variety of different colors.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about this book at first but decided to give it a try... Once I opened it I could not put it down I had it completely read in just over 24 hours!!!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|My husband wanted this for our MP3 players, we hear it at the bar all the time. We love it
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Victor Frankl went through hell on earth while in the Nazi concentration camp.  Yet he survived with lessons to teach each of us about survival through our own hardships.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My wife and I absolutely loved this series. We're very excited to see the movies following the book so well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I had a hard time putting my kindle down. It is a good read, the story teller had an interesting narrator, and he played his part well. I am not sure who I would suggest the story to, it should be someone that has hope in the human race.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Your going to like these guys. They are still a little unknown, but their music is a great unique blend of rock, kinda rap, and actual singing. Give it a whirl, you wont regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing on the kindle and this has all the functionality of the game on my pc.  now I can play anywhere there is WIFI.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|awesome! I like the tournoment and how they have every player in the world.everyone should get it. it is also free!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is an amazing game!!! Would like it to be a little harder game but still awesome!!! Would also like more gun selection!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game was the best.  I love playing it, it is a nice time User.  It is one of my favarite game that I have.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I had started to read this in paperback a couple years ago. I never seemed to have the time to read it until I got my Kindle. I started reading it at nite in bed. I couldn't put it down. It was awesome! I highly recommend it.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|As time trials go, &#34;Dumb Ways to Die&#34; is a delightfully fun, cute, and chaotic way to pass the time.  I absolutely love the bold and simplified art treatment.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Love this app. It has the 2013 New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures and the navagation is so easy my 5 year old daughter can use it. Wonderful App for meetings and foeld ministry. I have this app on my phone and nook tablet.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you don't think you will be into a show like this you'r probably wrong I know that I was.
B00C1N9JWO|1.0|Too expensive to buy this series any longer. :-(<br /><br />It's a shame. I did enjoy these books in the past.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice large buttons. Uses the full screen in portrait mode. Only complaint is that it doesn't work in landscape mode. So I have to lay my kindle fire HD flat on the table to use it. It would be nice to be able to use it with my kindle when it's propped up with my case.
B0072OFM28|5.0|because i love  ALL EPISODES OF EACH SEASON, I MISSED THESE BECAUSE I WAS BUSY MOVING AND HAD NO TV AVAILABLE
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fantastic book. I really can't say enough good things about it. I loved the geek aspect, and the story was incredibly engaging.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Great CD...all songs are  'IPod-able'.  Wide range of styles, but all memorable. I would definitely recommend.  Going to have to catch them in concert.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app! When I was travelling, I was able to use it as an alarm clock. (My hostel room didn't have one) And, in the middle of the night, I could clearly see what time it was.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|AWESOME best book so far in this series action drama comedy combined the house of Hades is cool too. :)
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Can't stand the layout and functionality.  Use the online version instead.  Sometimes moble apps don't cut it.  OK  One Two Three. Publish.
B007X4ECMI|1.0|I'm still a little disappointed in myself when I think that I sat through this whole movie.  The &#34;hero&#34; is the kind of man I would hate to have to walk past to get to my car after dark.  And he hasn't changed by the end of the movie.<br />The story starts with a woman in a position of authority trying to do something good for people who are imprisoned in a maximum security prison that orbits earth.  Things go from alright to desperate in a matter of seconds and her father calls in the one person capable of going in and bringing her out alive.  Not that the &#34;hero&#34; cares in the least about her or anyone else on the station.<br />The story was disjointed at best.  I watched it in a sub-run theater and when I left I thought the theater had never looked so grimy and dingy and dark.  Now I realize that was just my reaction to the lousy movie.<br />Let's put this in some perspective.  I enjoyed the TV show Firefly and I grew up watching war movies (Desert Rats, The Great Escape, The Longest Day, etc., etc.).  I also grew up watching Humphrey Bogart movies.  I own Timeline, Paycheck, Spider-Man, and The Avengers, and will probably someday own The Bourne Legacy.  I'm not opposed to action adventure movies.  I just thought that this one scraped the bottom of the barrel labeled &#34;How despicable can we make a hero and still have the audience buy it?&#34;
B003J27WFW|5.0|What can you say ? It's Rush. Fantastic video , very good definition and just the perfect gift for a Rush fan like me.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Reading within a minute. I was recommended this book so I went straight to amazon prices are great and the delivery is immediate I love it
B005HEPN06|5.0|This season seems to make a little better anticipation new technologies and advances.  Also LaForge is using a more realistic scientific explanation for things going on.  But still the quaint mininimalistic props that try to look like advanced devices does not anticipate what we developed just a few years after the season ended.  Here you start to notice the actors are getting a lot older.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I would've named this The Kung Fu Kid, but that's just me.  I watched this in the theater and then bought it when I found it on sale for a reasonable price.  Then I rewatched it.  Just when I was beginning to wonder why I had bought it, I started to laugh.  I was engaged in the story!<br />Jackie Chan does a great job playing a man who seems as serene as a mountain lake.  Like most people, though, once we get to know him, we realize that he has his troubles, he's just found a way to handle them - 364 days of the year.<br />Young Jaden Smith turns in a performance that I found believable.  (Of course, I've never been an adolescent boy, so...)<br />Like in the original, the teacher helps his student realize that one of the secrets of a happy life is being aware of oneself and how we fit into the world around us.
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|Great concert, amazing sound but the blu ray quality of the dvd is  terrible. It looks like a bootlegged dvd.  Very grainy and just doesnt look HD. I saw the the film version this summer and the quality of the filming was fantastic. I have no idea how this dvd passed quality control. The people at Rhino and crossroads should be ashamed. I have a high end Samsung led t.v. and blu ray player so I know its not my equipment. I also own all the previous crossroads concerts and no issue with quality. Still worth buying just for the concert footage but somebody should have watched the dvd before releasing it.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|This book was awsome. It was totally worth eight or nine dollars. You should definitely tri it man. Increadibly awsome man.
B00EY8AL1M|5.0|Season Three is great.  What you really is that still in the 1980's people in the technical know still could not anticipate the level of technology we would find just a few decades later.  The 24th century version of tablets and touch screen computers is kind of funny compare to the things that came along just five years after the series was completed.  Also you will notice the films were high quality but still shot in old TV format and not modern wide screen which was available at the time.  It is very quaint.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|The cd is totally fantastic!! I can't wait to watch the dvd!!  Love Testament, they rock hard! So glad I have actually seen them live too!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is great. If you like sharks. You won't be able to quit playing. The sound effects are hilarious. And the graphics are awesome. I cajt believe this game is free.<br />Get it now before its too late.
B009IA9OLE|1.0|I just bough this app few minutes ago and I don't like  it. All I do is just click on boxes to take out the people in the case and the game repeats itself. I don't see the point of this and this game is not very enjoyable. I would like the coins I spend to be refund.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|I chose ***** because I love cats, and I like comedy comics. This is a great combination of the two.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie and I was able to add it to my Flixster account for mobile viewing. Great remake using the original characters.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun easy to play. Just the thing I need to help relax and free my mind. I will keep playing, VERY ENJOYABLE<br />Spider will continue to be my game
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|The 1920's were a fantastic time for adventure, invention, and heroism.  Bill Bryson does a remarkable job of capturing the significance of the time with a balance of the frailty of the humans that shaped and lived the events of the time.  I thought I knew a lot about this era in American history, but I learned a great deal more from reading this book.  I recommend this book to the curious historian.

0307719219|5.0|My friends,<br />I found a very interesting book in the book review of the Japanese Newspaper. The book is recently published in Japanese. What Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson talk about in “Why Nations Fail” is economic growth and prosperity. Their thesis is clear and simple. Understanding politics is the key to explain world inequality. Inclusive economic and political institutions generate prosperity and promote virtuous cycle for further advance of the people, while extractive institutions lead to stagnation, poverty, and ultimately into vicious cycle. Poor countries are poor not because of geography, nor culture, nor ignorance, but because those who have power make choices that create poverty. Dictators are unanimously strapped by the iron law of oligarchy. What caught my attention is this is also applicable to explain the struggle for power within an ordinary private enterprise. Candidate directors are seemed to devote all their time to infighting for the autocracy, without thinking of peer’s happiness.<br /><br />World inequality today exists because some nations were unable to take advantage of the Industrial Revolution and the technologies and methods of organization it brought. Their failure was resulted from their extractive institutions, which is a consequence of the persistence of their absolutist regimes, or by the outcome they lacked centralized states. Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson conclude the solution to the economic and political failure of nations today is solved by transforming their extractive institutions into inclusive ones. Replacing the vicious circle of extractive institutions by inclusive ones is neither automatic nor easy. Some preexisting inclusive elements within institutions, or broad coalitions leading the fight against the existing regime, or just the contingent way of history unfolds, can break vicious circles. They also mention about the transformative role of media in the process of empowerment by the broad levels in the society.<br /><br />To get rid of disparity in economic power between the North and the South, their assertion is quite understandable. However, for the social goodness and the human happiness of the world we need to find the solution from another dimension. Their advocated inclusive economic and political institutions are still founded on the global consumer societies. Considering the emergent issue of the global warming, the population explosion, and the widening disparity within the society, seeking the sustainable answer in much more locally and less consuming manner would be our urgent issue.ls in the society.<br /><br />To get rid of disparity in economic power between the North and the South, their assertion is quite understandable.

B009NX1YT6|4.0|It's a cult classic that idolizes an era where change and culture were thrown to the winds and then put back together.

B00BD6KPFU|5.0|The original plots, snappy banter, and quirky characters continue in this excellent and humorous drama revolving around suits in a Manhattan legal firm.  The arrogant and suave senior partner Harvey, cool and cerebral Jessica who manages the firm, the boyish and brainy assistant Mike, and the irritating rat Lewish will charm you.  It's worth watching for Jessica's wardrobe along if you like that sort of thing.  The plots thicken with the return of the firm's owner Daniel Hartman.  It's a great show - wonderful to watch it free through Prime.
B00838HSYM|1.0|Like many others, I was misled. I do not understand why I was given the UK  version when living in the US. Beware.  These will not play in your systems. I bought this when expecting my first child so I did not check the movie soon enough. Now I'm out the money. :(

B00ENXBUR2|4.0|Not the best starter for a Justice League franchise, like Iron Man was to the Avengers. But still a film where the good outweighs the bad. Everything in this set is available, I believe, is available on the regular Blu-ray. It's more of display price. Not like the MCU Phase 1 box set, or The Amazing Spider-Man Limited Edition Gift Set. But still worth putting on your shelf.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|I purchased this disc after hearing the early release of &#34;Miss Jackson&#34; and without hearing any of the other tracks.  i've been a fan of Panic at the Disco from the very begining so i didn't think i could go wrong with my purchase.  I was right!  This is still Panic at the Disco but with a more mature sound.  I can't stop listening to this CD especially &#34;&#34;Far Too Young To Die&#34;, &#34;Casual Affair&#34;, &#34;Girls/Girls/Boys&#34; and &#34;Girl That You Love&#34;.  If you're a Panic at the Disco fan, you won't be disappointed with your purchase.
1490313370|5.0|As some of you may know, I've become a particularly big `Stan' of James Altucher's writings.  In his most recent book titled \\"Choose Yourself\\" he has a chapter named \\"Don't Have Opinions\\".  What? Everyone has opinions, was my initial reaction to the title.<br /><br />The author begins with a question, \\"do you really think you are going to change anyone's mind?\\".  My answer is simply no.  He continues with a couple more questions, \\"What is the purpose of an opinion? To prove you're right?  You're wrong.\\"<br /><br />One very good point Altucher makes is when he writes, \\"I'm trying to eliminate things.  Not just material belongings I no longer need or never really needed to begin with, but all those things we've been taught from birth are \\"important\\" or \\"our way of life\\" that have actually become burdens and wastes of time because we cling to them and protect them like they are more precious than the time and energy we waste protecting them.\\"<br /><br />He begins the next paragraph with \\"opinions are a way of clinging to the past.\\"  In segment \\"B) One hundred years from now, everyone reading this book will be dead.\\"  It reads that \\"science has no limits.\\"  And in \\"D) Why educate people? he writes \\"only worry about your own happiness, which doesn't have to be limited by anyone else's stupidity unless you allow it to be.<br /><br />Then we head to point \\"E) I  could be reading a book.  Time is also a limited resource.  And \\"F) I think most people fight because they are alone.  There's nothing we can do about loneliness in the material world.  We've been trapped in these bodies since birth.  But we try.  We want people to agree with us so that for a brief second we can feel good about ourselves, establish a connection, and then make slow, sweet love.<br /><br />We continue with \\"G) I'm always wrong.  I have never had a correct opinion...\\"Opinions are like money.  No matter how much you know, there's always someone who knows more.  And they aren't afraid to flaunt it.  This paragraph concludes with \\"when I give an opinion, I know that opinion works for me, right then.  But that's about it.  I don't always need to fight for glory.  I find that if I dig deep and throw away one thing a day, then I wake up the next day a little more peaceful.  I don't need to have so may opinions.<br /><br />The next solid point is \\"I) Less.  I find that if I dig deep and throw away one thing a day, then I wake up the next day a little more peaceful.  I don't need to have so many opinions.  And \\"J) Bewildered.  We live in strange world...  Clues unfold...  The light is strange, your eyes are dilated (because of those eye drops the dentist people are very, very busy walking around you, paying with the currency of unhappiness now in order to reach their glorious futures someday... maybe.\\"<br /><br />He ends the chapter by saying, \\"the point is, don't focus on those things in the material world that you cannot control or possibly ever change, when you can focus on inner health, on your inner world, on the things that matter.\\"  I agree with all the above!s paragraph concludes with \\"when I give an opinion, I know that opinion works for me, right then.

B000KJU182|5.0|This dilemma is confronted with urgency on a British naval warship during the worst Napoleonic wars.  French aggression led to a desperate shortage of both healthy sailors and assertive crew foremen.  Therefore, the fatally naive Budd and dangerously corrupt Claggart were promoted to positions they would have been considered far too inexperienced for during peacetime.  Although every man on the ship empathized with Budd, war often forbade leniency regardless of circumstances.  The problem of superiors segregating themselves so completely that evil goes unchecked is worse than ever 200+ years later.

B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Seth Hubbard, a twice divorced sixty something year old rich white man hangs himself after handwriting a will leaving 90 % percent of his fortune to his black housekeeper, 5 % to a lost brother and 5 % of the church of his affiliation, nothing to his children and grandchildren He knows the will be contested by his family for reasons of insanity, so he sent the handwritten will to Jake Brigance, a lawyer John Grisham had portrayed as his main character in his masterpiece \\"A time to kill\\", Seth orders are, you must defend this will against my family challenge, no matter what. I would not call Sycamore row a sequel as there is not continuation of the story, but the scheme is similar, Jake Brigance facing a barrage of professional lawyer firms full of money,  resources, dirty tricks and no qualms to win the civil trial, middle chapters referring to legwork and research in preparations for the trial, a mild  description about  society customs in the towns of the State of Mississipi, probably the most racist of the US.  The book is gripping, colorful, well thought, following the same scheme as in \\"A time to Kill\\" Grisham lets the story go in the beginning working on character development, the middle encompasses jury selection, background research and legwork in preparation to the showdown in court, while he deftly keeps tension building up all the way to the ending, the reader keeps guessing and guessing, the final veredict could be for any side, at the end he drops a bomb a great emotional surprise  that could be deem contrived but actually was not, it was very well prepared from the beginning. Runs smooth, entertaining good read, will not dissapoint.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Received this compilation as an xmas gift years ago.  I've collected all of the Floyd's studio and most of the live albums and I still find this 2 disc set is a great listen.  Many negative reviewers lament the mixed-up order and the omission/inclusion of certain songs and/or claim that Floyd's songs need the context of their albums to be truly appreciated.  However, I think this compilation is enjoyable precisely because of the seemingly random order & wide variety of the songs.<br /><br />In fact, these days I find that I listen to this compilation at least as much as any of the other Floyd albums.  This is mainly because I don't have the song sequence memorized and I am always pleasantly surprised by what comes next.<br /><br />Yes, they could have included certain songs at the expense of others, but tough editing decisions had to be made to get all of the songs onto 2 CDs.  Personally, I would have liked this compilation to have \\"Cirrus Minor\\" from 'More' and probably \\"What's...Uh the Deal\\" from 'Obscured by Clouds'.  \\"Fat Old Sun\\", representing 'Atom Heart Mother' would also have been nice.  But then what tracks do you cut or pare down to make room for these gems?  And of course I can think of a few more favorite tracks that could have been added for additional variety.  But then a 3rd disc would have been required.<br /><br />One area of improvement:  I think they could have done a better job of mixing these tracks seamlessly together.  Some of the crossfade mixes are excellent, other transitions either don't work well or are basically non-existent.  I would have liked this to have been one long flowing set with no silence between the songs.  Most Floyd songs fade in and out, so stitching all of the tracks together without gaps shouldn't have been difficult with a little more thought & effort.  Despite this shortcoming, I still like the concept.<br /><br />A 2-disc compilation of a band with as much diverse output as the Floyd will never be complete or perfect, but to my ears this comes pretty close.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Factual or not I cannot say. Given the author's research I take his historical perspective at face value.  That alone adds depth to the life and times of Jesus.  But it doesn't speak to the motive of the man. Here then is the great divide in this book. The author may be correct is his assumptions about how the message of Jesus was interpreted by Jews living under the yoke of Rome.  But I don't believe he can speak with any authority as to the intentions of Jesus.  People may have seen Jesus as just another nationalistic rebel, but that doesn't make him one.<br />If you choose to read this book do so remembering there are many attempts to unravel the mystery that is Jesus the Christ. This is but one of them.

B00004XPPC|1.0|If you know anything about the real history involved, this film is a complete dud.  Ever since it was first released, this film has been universally reviled by the men who actually built the so-called &#34;Railway of Death&#34; (linking the rail networks of Siam and Burma to facilitate supplying the Japanese forces that had occupied Burma).  The first clue that this film is a joke comes from the title.  The bridge in question was not actually on the Kwai River,  but on the Mae Klong River (Kwai sounds &#34;cooler&#34; however so the location was changed).  The Japanese are portrayed as idiots who can't build a bridge and need the expertise of the prisoners to complete it.  If the Japanese were so incompetent, how did they build all of those aircraft, warships, etc. (and how were they able to kick the British out of Burma with ease)?  While the overall technology of the Japanese Empire lagged behind the Western powers, it was nevertheless respectable, and Japanese military engineers were certainly capable of designing and constructing a bridge.  In real life, the Japanese did not even build a new bridge over the Mae Kling anwyay.  They simply dismantled an out of service railway bridge located on Java, shipped it to the Mae Klong River, and reassembled it.  Hardly the stuff of an epic war film, and this is definitely not that.  I would give this film zero stars if I could because it is such an insult to the brave prisoners of war who were there and suffered grave hardships.  If you want a great war film that deals with the far eastern theater of the war, I suggest The Mountain Road instead.  There are many great World War II films out there, and to name a few others I will suggest Twelve O'clock High, The Sands of Iwo Jima, Das Boot, Downfall, and Under the Flag of the Rising Sun.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  It is just about the most complete piece of drivel ever put on film.  How this film ever won an Oscar for Best Picture I will never understand.

B008JFUS28|4.0|When Marvel Comics was ramping up its &#34;Phase One&#34; of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it seemed like the hardest character to get to connect with an audience was a Norse demigod. You had a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist who wore a metal suit and fought bad guys; you had a meek scientist that could turn into the strongest being on the planet; you had a brave and good-hearted weakling that was turned into a super-soldier to fight the ultimate earthly evil. But a dreamy god of Norse legend that threw a big hammer around? How could they make that work? Thanks to some star-making performances by Chris Hemsworth as the titular god of thunder and Tom Hiddleston as the seductive and duplicitous god of mischief, and quality supporting performances by the likes of Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, and Anthony Hopkins, as well as solid direction by Kenneth Branagh, we had a really good time with the first THOR. And after the events of THE AVENGERS, where Thor and Loki played a large part in, we felt even better about these charcters. Now, it's time for &#34;Phase Two&#34;, and a new ancient evil threatens all of existence and it's time for Thor to pick up Mjolnir again and for the Asgardians to take up arms and defend all the nine realms in THOR: THE DARK WORLD.<br /><br />The Nine Realms are reaching an era of peace that Thor and his compatriots of the Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander, reprising), and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, reprised by Ray Stevenson; Hogun, reprised by Tadanobu Asano, and Fandral. played by Zachary Levi replacing Joshua Dallas) look to stop the forces that threaten the peace on the separate realms, and Loki rots in a cell, with only his mother Frigga (Rene Russo, reprising) as a visitor. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Jane Foster (Portman, reprising), Darcy (Dennings, reprising) and Erik Selvig (Skarsgard, reprising) are investigating a very strange anomaly in London. This anomaly ties to a long-lost power once wielded by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svarltleheim want to use to remake the universe into nothingness again (as it once was, as explained in a spectacular prelude by Odin, again reprised by Hopkins). This power infects Jane, the love of Thor's life and he appears once again on Earth to whisk her away to Asgard. She meets his family and friends, but is soon falling victim to the infection of the power coursing through her. And Malekith, drawn to this power, attacks Asgard and causes a tragic death that spurs Thor to take the fight to Malekith and the remainder of the Dark Elves. But on order to get there, they must first free Loki, who has reasons of his own to stop Malekith. So Thor and Loki and Jane escape Asgard as fugitives to the barren wasteland of Svartleheim, and the fight continues on Earth as Thor and Malekith face off for the fate of the universe.<br /><br />Firstly, the film is much more visually stunning than the first one. Alan Taylor (a director of many great TV shows such as ROME, DEADWOOD, and THE SOPRANOS, but perhaps most famous for his work on GAME OF THRONES) replaces Branagh as the director here, and has the benefit of a much more remarkable visual palette to work with, with much of the film taking place in Asgard, but every place they go just looks more detailed than what was previously seen in the original. Secondly, the film has a much more distinct comic book feel to it thanks to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (this is the second of three Marvel films they've written together; firstly with CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, then this, and soon the upcoming CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER) as well as Christopher Yost, a great comic writer in his own right as well as the creative force behind the greatest of the Marvel cartoons, such as AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES and WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN. So there's a lot of behind-the-scenes talent at work. In front of the screen, there is, as with most sequels,more of an opportunity to expand character and not focus so much on exposition. You really get the feeling that with three films under his belt as the same character that Hemsworth is absolutely 100% comfortable as Thor. He exudes the strength, courage, sacrifice, charm and hard-headedness that the character is most known for. The other Asgardians get some more time as well, with more exposure for Sif and the Warriors Three and especially for the all-seeing guardian Heimdall (reprised by Idris Elba, whose work in films like PACIFIC RIM and shows like LUTHER seem to require he gets more screentime). Sadly, this is where the film makes some mistakes, though. Only the wonderfully funny Dennings gets more to do in this film from a character standpoint. Portman seems to be almost woefully underused here. She seems to be either a damsel-in-distress or a device for advancing the plot of those around her. The great Christopher Eccleston has almost nothing to do here except for appear in freaky makeup and look and sound menacing. At least the villain of the first film was given something to do, and it would have greatly benefitted the film if Malekith were allowed to speechify a bit to give his character a little more gravity.<br /><br />However, if this villain is a little on the weak side, it's only because this film's other &#34;villain&#34; is so incredibly strong, and of course, I'm talking about the genius of Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He walks away with this film, as he did from a performance standpoint in THE AVENGERS. The first film spent a good deal of time with Hemsworth and Hiddleston evenly balanced, and while Thor has more screentime, once Loki is on screen, all eyes must divert to him. Hiddleston's performance is so magnetic, so sleekly charming and so smartly crafted that he's created one of the great screen characters, let alone screen villains, in recent years. The scene where he and Thor are walking together as Loki keeps changing forms (and creates a BRILLIANT cameo) is easily the best scene in the film.<br /><br />The thing that I felt most about this film after it was over, aside from how interesting and exciting and epic the film felt was that there is a longer version of this film somewhere. The film clocks in at an exceedingly brisk 112 minutes (and that's including TWO post-credits sequences), and I think there's more there that maybe was cut for budgetary constraints, because I can't think of this film cropping anything for time when it's that short.<br /><br />All in all, THOR: THE DARK WORLD is by far the better of the two &#34;Phase Two&#34; films that Marvel released this year thanks to a stronger story, stronger performances, and a greater dedication to the comic book ideals that make these great characters who they are.more of an opportunity to expand character and not focus so much on exposition.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it's fun and I think it's great for kids who like cars and racing car games .I give it  5 stars.
0071762345|5.0|An explicit and insightful look at the power and promise of social media done right. Best book I've read on the subject.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|My children love Carly Rae.  Service was excellent and the CD is everything that my kids wanted.  Thanks for such excellent service.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|What is not to love about this classic!  (The language is rough, but does fit into film characters well)  This stupid review is telling me I need to add more words - so I did!
B00BATG18K|5.0|I always manage to get completely drawn into the lives of the characters in her stories. Also, feel as if I have a much better understanding of the history & culture of those times! I lays learn new things that enrich the story for me.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|Album came shrink wrapped and new, amazing record would not hesitate if you were thinking of buying. Beautiful record regardless the cost.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|&#34;Food Inc.&#34; is a well-crafted documentary on contemporary corporate agribusiness. It focuses on the consequences of increasing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and the wide range of unanticipated effects of government subsidies for corn. For those interested in the film as a tool for teaching about corporate capitalism, corporate capture of government institutions, and the contest between corporations and the rest of us for control of the circumstances of our lives, it's a pretty good film. it does bog down at points, and I'm not sure it's possible to make a documentary longer than 30 minutes that's not going to put some people to sleep, but all things considered, I think it's pretty good.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|At some point, we as a society will realize that we can't just put the pretty fish in a tank and think there won't be consequences. Blackfish is a provocative look behind the scenes at how these creatures are obtained, handled and treated. I believe the handlers and trainers at Sea World truly have the animals best interest at heart, however... the animals should not be at Sea World. This overpriced aquarium has rubbed me wrong from day one. I will never take my child there. Sea World should be closed down for their incompetence.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Flight is a superb story that unflinchingly depicts human frailty then follows up with the power of redemption. The movie is inspiring, primarily due to Denzel Washington's Oscar-worthy acting.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Funny movie, my only prob was that the disc was loose in the package and some of the disc art was scratched off; but hey what can you expect when the dvd only cost 1 cent plus shipping. the movie played flawlessly and I've bought other used DVD's before, i buy used when i javent seen a movie and don't know if ill like it; most movies i buy are from previews from other movies i already own.
B000SCHBGQ|2.0|As long as I was reading, I was immersed in the  story, but as soon as I stopped reading I found it difficult to come back to read more. I have nothing against the story, I am even considering reading the next however I didn't find it that remarkable.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|With all the new music- it is great to know the artist!!<br />I also like it for all the oldies but goodies
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a wholesome movie for all ages. I am  30 years old and I enjoyed watching it with my daughter. It has a over all theme of change can happen to anyone if you want it bad enough. I can't wait to purchase part 2
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I own all but one of the resident evil movies, and like the rest, they seem flawlessly in storyline and characters. even though its impossible, i love the shotgun shells filled with quarters.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Violent to an extreme, but a story I was unable to put aside.  Certainly, a skilled writer, but with the penchant of killing off characters as you grow to like them that eventually left me feeling cheated as if a long held investment became suddenly worth but nil.<br /><br />I found that with 150 pages to go that there was no way to end it satisfactorily.  I suppose that was the point though, how could such a story be concluded in a tidy neat present presented to the reader all pretty and clean.  The Dragon Queen developed nicely. But what of the Stark girls? Obviously room is left to both the imagination and additional books.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I think it's AWESOME nice graphics fun but it takes so long to get allot of coins I only have 10000 coins but I need 20000 to get what I want so that's why it's a 4.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The game keeps changing. Can't get to my challenges unless I go home first. Reward always pop up when  I go for my collections And you never are told when you reach an award.<br /> Some players are able to put hundreds on chips on the table when they own low chips and we have a maximum to put on which is much lower ( and those players tent to Bully with their chips.
B007B8H97Q|5.0|I rarely ever watch TV, but I absolutely love this show, so that's saying a lot! Downton Abbey has everything that makes a show great.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|They work great, and are  very  bright.  They light up a large area, and are wonderful when fishing at night.
1451696191|5.0|I got it for my daughter and she loved it!  she'd rather read the book than watch the movie.  Every time I walk by her room she's reading it.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I love this game. It makes my think logically without being too difficult. I only wish there were more levels.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great time waster, love that you can play off-line. Easy tap screen game to play and let my daughter mess around with when she is bored on a car ride and I am tired .of I spy, lol.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Anything Motorhead is 5 star - lifetime fan<br />They keep putting them out, I'll keep buying them up.<br />Long live Lemmy!
B0032SQCQI|1.0|From the previews of this movie I was hoping that it would be a film about greed, morals, principles, etc. but it would turn into some sci-fi crap which is a shame cause writers could have went somewhere with this film. I'm very surprised that James Marsden read this script and thought it would be a film to do, he's a talented versatile actor and this film is way beneath him. He must have needed a paycheck or something is all I can chalk it up to.<br /><br />I got confused watching this movie cause the plot was just all over the place. If you haven't seen it please don't waste your time. This film almost makes The Happening with Mark Wahlberg look academy award winning.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game you must get this the minions are cute and the graphics are amazing please get it &lt;&deg;&middot;&deg;&lt; kirby
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly  is a must read author.  His stories are so believable it is difficult to understand that he has not been a lawyer, detective, etc. for decades.  I always learn of a musician or song that is new to me.  Plus his characters always have a statement or take-away truth.  For example when Haller is discussing law with his associate &#34;Bullocks&#34;:<br />&#34;I just don't know why you can't have it both ways.  You know, give unbridled effort in your defense but be conscientious about your work.  Try for the best  possible outcome.<br />&#34;The best possible outcome for who?  Your client? Society? Or for yourself?  Your responsibility is to your client and the law, Bullocks.  That's it.&#34;<br />I gave her a long stare before continuing.<br />&#34;Don't go growing a conscience on me,&#34; I said.  &#34;I've been down that road.  It doesn't lead you to anything good.&#34;
B00DZPVS9O|4.0|Missed a couple in between this new one and the last purchase, but they are still a good hard beat.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great Movie. Old Trekkies will love the Rath of the Characters that are introduced.If your love Sci Fi. You will like this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I keep looking for more Mahjong games, but then always find myself back playing this one again. Easy to read tiles and lots of levels for a free game. I liked it so much I eventually got the paid version. My only complaint would be that sometimes the stacking makes it hard to see the free tiles. I don't know if that's a bug or a feature.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington's portrayal of an Alcoholic pilot was riveting!  From the first scene, where he expertly guides his plane through a horrific thunderstorm during takeoff, to his brave manipulation of the plane during the crash scene, and finally his breakdown when being questioned under oath, he made this movie very exciting!!  This movie was a combination of Apollo 13 and Leaving Las Vegas!!!  One of Denzel's best!!!
B006QKKMBA|5.0|Rare that you find a film that seems to understand it is not original, yet able to work with the principles and make them it's own.  This films works great!  You care about the characters.  It is not the blood orgy you would expect from &#34;number 5&#34;, though it does pay a kind of twisted homage to the previous filmsl over the closing credits.<br /><br />Love the way it ties in to the other films at the end.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved the Divergent series. I fell in love with Divergent. Insurgent was even better. I have to say that Allegient wasn't as good. But the end captured me. I cried and I read until I finished. I couldn't stop. And I felt like punching Veronica Roth for killing Tris. This series enchanted me. I am so psyched about the movie. An mark your calenders. April sixth (4/6) is official Four and Tris(Six) day. I am now reading the books about Tobias, and I love them. This has and will remain my all-time favorite series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you are in the quality control field, this game will help you in your profession. It will help you to see what others don't. Plus it will improve your observational skills!
B0031R5K8G|5.0|It was Good, I like the way it was set up.  :D I also like Christopher's Swiss army knife :))))
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|loved it so much especially the monkey and the china doll.  The story was very interesting and the special effects were breath taking but not scary for older children.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Glides effortlessly down a twisted road.  Glad I had four days to devote to nothing but reading because I could not put this book down except for a few breaks.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book thief is written wonderfully, and the story will capture your heart. I read the entire book within a week!
B00DQQSD3G|5.0|Great books in their hardback versions<br /><br />Exceptional ebook enhanced editions<br /><br />I got both!<br /><br />When are the prequel versions coming to print?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|excellent cast of very talented actors, fantastic plot and all! Loved the movie so true to the book. excellent movie must see
1742204147|5.0|Lonely Planet's JAPAN is a good introduction to the country. It has beautiful color photographs and thorough descriptions. It has useful itineraries and guides to the country's culture. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Japan.
B00E6F155E|5.0|THE MASTER INNOVATOR..THE GENIUS..THE BAND..TONY LEVIN..MANU KATCHE..THIS IS AN ART FORM,A MUSICAL EXPERIENCE..THIS ALONG WITH SECRET WORLD TOUR 2 OF THE FINEST MUSICAL TOURS EVER..GREAT QUALITY AUDIO AND VIDEO.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I just finished watching the final season of Dexter and I guess my review is very different from a lot of other people but I found it to be BRILLIANT! There were still bad people to kill. Debra came back whole. The story with Dr. Vogel was very interesting. I loved that Joey and Deb were kind of back together again and I did not mind at all seeing Hannah again. I think she really loves Dexter and he loves her. The fact that he almost becomes human because of love is a good thing. The only thing I did NOT LIKE is the end of the season for obvious reason but I will not SPOIL it for the people out there who did not see it yet. I think the writers did a great job with the final season EXCEPT for the end. The end could have been so much better but even though it did not end well, I think it is still realistic that they chose it to end this way. Great JOB, Great series!! Dexter, you will be missed.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|Little known, but Fantastic period mystery movie that even kids will get into.  Dame Maggie Smith is lovely, as always.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife came to me sharp out of the box. It works for what it's meant for. knives are made for cutting and a good knife full tang knife for batoning. If you need to chop, get an axe. There are ways to proses wood the right way without chopping with it. This is one of my favorite knives and for the money well spent.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|think you have the best hunting game we'll you thought wrong guys you like hunting your game is right here and you can hunt anything that I would<br />Want to hunt get this and you won't regret it and the best part is its free!!!!
B0000071ZV|5.0|America missed out on this rare talent of the 80's and 90's. Synth-jazz at its best with always great vocals and rigs.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Loved the Harry Potter books and movies, and this one is no exception.  Great movies that will entertain adults and kids alike
0141345659|4.0|Sooooo sad but great book! cried throughout the book. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars: the maturity of the high school girl was a tad unbelievable, they just don't speak like that. Overall GREAT read. Read from start to finish on my vacation. Recommended to my friends and family.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I did not feel any continuity between Allegiant  and the first two books of the series.  I felt book 1 and 2 in the series were about Tris and then wham book 3 is all about Tobias. And Tobias was so out of character from what he was in the first two books. For me a big build up at the end of Insurgent and then big let down with Allegiant
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Such a great series to have been lost so young... thank goodness for home video. At least we got the Serenity film.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I stopped playing Castleville on Facebook because friends didn't appreciate all the posting clogging th e news feed. T his game still has some postings, but a lot less. It's fun to play!
030758836X|5.0|This book consumed me! I didn't want to do anything else! I hope the movie does this book justice. A fantastic read and I definitely recommend!!!
B0073COMUW|5.0|Great price, very bright, and will save me $$ and I wont have to change this bulb again in my life tiome
140006922X|3.0|Recycled much of the extant history--not necessarily anything new.  You should read it, and then read some of the critical reviews by others.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Yes the price is higher than normal, but get over it.  Skip one fast food meal and you paid for the episode and are healthier too.<br /><br />Now on to the review.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Doctor Who then you will love the 50th anniversary episode The Day of the Doctor. Even with high expectations,  I still enjoyed it immensely. Action, suspense, time-travel, and great characters.  They nailed this one and it should please even hard core fans.<br /><br />Not much more to say.  No spoilers.
0399159347|4.0|I read this book in less than 3 days.. Great book. Would definitely recommend. Handed this book off to a coworker the day I finished. Reason I didn't give 5 star - I just finished Gone Girl and that book blows this one away.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Great CPU.. Increased my processing power by double!!!  I use this computer for video rendering and cut the amount of time to convert video from DVD to MP4 by half...  Great upgrade for anyone who has an older AM3 socket mother board and doesn't want to go through the hasell of upgrading their whole computer.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is a very good lavalier mic.  It comes with everything you need, even the battery.  Nice little clip; Good price too.  If you're going to use this with a 1/4 adapter for an amp, like I do, you need a stereo 1/8&#34; to mono 1/4&#34; adapter.  It's got a stereo 1/8&#34; connector, which is really 2 mono channels (Left/Right).
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie was very entertaining. It was a lot of fun to watch with my 15 year old son.  It is hard to find movies we both enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really like this calculator.  So easy to use and large enough to make it easier on the eyes.<br />I. Can easily figure out how much tax I will be paying with the percentages.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I could not get this app downloaded, I kept getting an error message saying this app could not be downloaded.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|I don't care what anyone says. I love all of the hangover movies, including this one.  Yes they are all deja vu and fallow the same story format, but when you think about it thats kind of the point.  4 people that keep getting trashed time and time again ending up in a the same situation.  Just accept the similarities and enjoy the movie.
0956721591|5.0|I didn't read the description too well I guess, as I was surprised to find a full English audiobook version on the CD as well! As the English reads well and is close to the French, it would make a great resource for someone studying English too.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I really loved this book and it is sad. I ended up making my husband watch the movie when it came out but the book was a lot better and more in depth. Some things didn't happen in the movie the same as the book so if you've seen the movie first...that may frustrate you.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game, good graphics but some images are very hard to see. A better zoom option would be nice. Fun!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book had one of the worst endings I've ever read. I felt like I wasted my time reading the whole series only to be let down in the end. I also felt like many of the actions taken by the characters throughout the book were not in line with the characterizations that had been built throughout the entire series. Much of this book moved very slowly in contrast to the first two books. I felt that the explanation for why the city existed was weak and left me wanting more. Ultimately I feel that the author chose an ending that was designed more for shock value and not for the integrity of the series.
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|GREAT!!!!  Is and always THE BEST!! Great voice and gorgeous! Nobody does it better! I cried 3 times. Bravo Barbra!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely loved this serious of books. The books (as expected so far) have been much more detailed then the movies and I found myself reading through these very quickly. Great writer and excellent story line.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Five stars  wonderful book.  I recommend it to everyone.  Five stars ,extraordinary book.it has changed the way I look at everything.  I
B000SOSS5W|5.0|The movie is awesome. The music, the mood, Paris. I recommend the movie to anyone; however DO NOT SEE IT ON AMAZON INSTANT STREAMING UNLESS YOU HAVE A GREAT EAR FOR FRENCH. For what ever the reason Amazon does not give you the English translation of the French dialog, like everyone else, and a good 25 to 30 % of the movie is in French. I called them about this they said the would get back to me. They neither got back to me or refunded my money. I guess they want to be pursued for 2 or 3 dollars. The movie is great, it's fun and tragic The music is awesome the acting is genius, the characters are well defined and multidimensional. I have seen the movie several times before. Even considering Amazon's flawed copy of the movie it was fun watching it again.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Fantastic fast paced and dynamic movie.  Just when you are SURE you have figured it out you are thrown a curve ball.  It does a great job of holding you to literally the start of the end credits.
0393327345|4.0|The book is essential to appreciating the movie most fully in my opinion. In fact, I think reading the book makes you appreciate how excellent the movie is. The book is great and this may be a case in which the movie is better because of how it brings the book to life. However, I don't find the book as comic as the movie and that is relevant. They are both so much to digest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game. I especially love all the new stuff that they keep adding. I totally recommend this game to anyone and everyone. If you like games then here is your game. So to all the people that keep upgrading this game hurry up, will ya'. Jk you guys are awesome. Keep it comin'. THANKS!!!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Awesome. One of my favorite movie this is. It was delivered very fast in a good condition. Very clean and it works well.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have every season of Big Bang and still watch the reruns that are syndicated. This show is witty, funny and very well written. All of the characters are great. I still watch it. I don't know anyone who doesn't like this show.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I don't care what the critics say, this movie rocks. I loved it. If you grew up in the 80s and know the pop charts you will know all the songs and love it too. Not for kids though...too sexy. Some singers definitely outshined others but it was still excellent and a must have or at least a must watch. Tom cruise is a great singer...if he had a concert, I would definitely go.
B004AP9W46|4.0|It is touching to the heart and your very soul. Anne you are either a genius or you have friends in special places ;)
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Awesome! Thank you very much. It's new and it works perfectly. Movie is also awesome as well :)  I strongly suggest you to buy this item
B001O03NCW|4.0|Still holds up after all these years. Some of the tracks weren't as great as I remember but still a good solid purchase for the price.
078518533X|5.0|Great book and amazing artistry.  This is the perfect gift for a teenager just getting into comic books with an interest in sci-fi.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Andrew Ender Wiggins at the age of six is a remarkable boy. The pain from the isolation that he endures is as hard for this reader to bear as the physical/emotional pain that is inflicted upon him by the 'enemies' in his life. I wanted to protect him.<br />I read this book because my son recommended it. He had read it in school some years ago and was looking forward to seeing the movie. I was curious, so I picked it up and was quickly caught up in this futuristic yet believable story.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|I love the Alex rider series , this book ,like all the others , was epic ,exhilarating , and AWESOME !!!!! Anthony Horowitz is a geinious !!! I can't wait to read the rest of his books . He has wrote other books outside of this series. I'll read them once I finish this series . Take my advice read the series ,watch the movies and look up Alex rider photos on Google , you won't be disappointed when you find out yourself how much Alex rider can leave you on the edge of your seat!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|You may be disappointed with this device if you don't see what Google says it can do. Specifically, what apps it works with. If you know it's current limitations you'll be much happier.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Easy to learn, fun to play, good fun.  Graphics are clean and crisp.  Plus its free, what else could you ask for?
B000GFLKEY|5.0|inside man was a unusual mystery.with denzel washington&clive owen.both were fantastic.it is a movie you could watch several times,still enjoy each time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I get stuck a lot but otherwise fun, they should update the emojis though. Also more ways to get free money
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was a joy to read and it was interesting all the way through with no boring chapters.  I found it very compassionate.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! Very addictive! I love all the costumes although I do wish you could buy more of them with bananas.......
1439153663|5.0|very well written.she is very postive on her subject.hopefully kathleen grissom will write more on this family future.such a great read.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really like this game.  Sometimes it seems like it takes too long for things to be created, but since I am just staring to play I am impatient.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It is like amazing!!!! I can add color to my pictures and get rid of red eye and more this is the best of the best.......a must have :)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|HAVING FUN PLAYING THIS! Even better because it was free. You really can't beat that. Try it for yourself. Winner!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this version! I have tried others and they don't compare in speed. This version suddently wouldn't apply the letters and I had to delete and re install; but it was ok then. I'm glad I figured out how to do it. I'm not reality tech wavy lol
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a remarkable book. Every girl needs a Christian Grey on her worst day. He is a little over the top but he needs love and trust. I recommend this book to all my friends.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Any book by Danielle Steel is a great book. I don't know how she does it I mean writes 4-5 books a year. I had a book published in 2010 unfortunately my husband was diagnosed with cancer so the promoting of my book had to wait. So at the moment I am working on a novel and a non-fiction book about mine and my late husbands great and wonderful love of 39 years. I will never be great like Danielle but I want people to buy my book(the first one) and learn something from it when their loved one is in a coma like I was in 2007. The name of my book is The Dreams That Changed My Life By Deborah Hodapp. [...] press.com/dreams
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|The video is fine, the commentary is far left.  Turn the sound off and enjoy the visuals.  (I knew this going in, and bought it anyway)
B00DZVKQGY|4.0|Well-written. It starts out a bit slow--which is one reason I'm always skeptical of the Amazon sample reads--because this book picks up pace a little further down the road. It's well worth sticking with it, though. The author captures the struggles of real life-family issues and the challenges of teenage drama. There are some graphic scenes, which I wasn't expecting. I'm not a prude--if you saw my reading list you'd know that!--but they caught me off-guard and seemed a bit out of place in the story. I guess what I'm saying is the story is fabulous without added shock value. The cover doesn't really do this book justice--I almost overlooked it until a friend mentioned I should give it a try. So give it a try! The characters are very well crafted.
B0009K7RES|5.0|There is a nice live feeling of the sound on this EP. They have more punch then the album version. \\"Song for sonny liston\\" is much better in this version. Sonics are good as always when it comes to Knopfler.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very challenging and is addictive. Iinvite friends to play with me and I know many people are in the higher levels but I am stuck on level 70.
0156030306|5.0|excellent condition with excellent delivering time.<br />i pay it for my daughter she love it  and recommend it to her friend.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This is one of the most touching and thought-provoking books I've read in a long time. It lingers with me still. I highly recommend it. It is worth more than five stars. You will not be disappointed.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I love the details and intimacy in this live recording.Much can be read about the good sound of this album if you google it. Most of it is true.
030014332X|5.0|This one is for children, but an adult can fill in some facts previously unknown. These are short summeries of key events in the written history of mankind. Over the long arc, you can see a tiny bit of progress, but also that we have remained the same at the core. It is good to see the rise and fall of empires and at certain times and places, peace was possible.
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|I really don't like Michael Connelly as an author. He just can't write them as fast as I can read them!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There are very few books in life that you know you can read again and again and always be captivated. There are many reviews of this book already that detail the plot so I won't do that. In fact, I hesitated writing a review because there were already so many…but this is a book that I want to scream to the world &#34;READ THIS!&#34; Excellent plot. Well-written characters. Amazing read in every aspect.
B003M98792|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid and loved it. It's a classic samurai movie with an amazing kid actor.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|absolutely perfect and the price was perfect too.  It protects my kindle and makes it feel more like a book.  I love it!
B009WUBERW|4.0|We gave this movie 4 stars because it had some pretty funny parts and it had a lot more action than the first Expendables, however, in our opinion the first Expendables was better than Expendables 2. I believe that all 1st versions of  movies are always better than all the other versions that are made after the first version.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Dark Tim Burton comedy, this was funnier the second I watched it. Not having seen the original series, I wonder if it was this campy. In any case, I liked the time and place feeling Burton created and the characters seem at home there...except poor Barnabas. Transfusing a vampire's blood, I hadn't seen that before.
0345494768|5.0|Excellent book. You'll like it if you're a StarWars fan. I learned about how it really seemed impossible that this movie came about. It's the relentless vision of an artist and luck in bringing together talented people
B005K17RU0|4.0|Would have given 5 but, it loads rather slowly.  In all fairness, it may be my ISP, its DSL, the only thing we have available in this remote location
B009QA3VY2|5.0|Friend told me that Forster's writing style reminded her of Chechov's works. We both grew up with Russian classics and I had to try this one - I know it is a famous work, but I will probably never catch up with all &#34;cultural gaps&#34; I still have in English written literature. Actually, I have read one work by this author - &#34;Maurice&#34;, so I was somewhat familiar with his writing, but nothing else. I loved it - I read a lot of genre fiction and mostly review romance books, but I had to say at least something about this one. Yes, it did remind me of Chechov a lot and mostly because author's look at his characters was so very sympathetic no matter how unsympathetic these people could act. It is a realistic book, that's pretty much sums it up in my opinion. Yes, it is also a portrayal of British culture at that time, but I did not grew up in that culture, so I cannot say how well it was done, I just enjoyed very well written story which felt like real life, but made sense.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|was good but the ending was off. Would have liked to see him end in a different way. but still good
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Strictly TRASH!  Skip this book as it has very limited redeeming qualities. Not worth your it if you value your time.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was crushed by the end of this book. I literally started crying. Over all the series was good. But I almost wish for a different ending. Veronica Roth is a great writer, I wish she just did something a little different with this book.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Great movie about all lights and shadows of an relationship. Perfect acting and much less sissy glamour than expected. This film asks all the important questions you can ask about why you share your life with somebody.
B00B2QG3K2|2.0|A disappointing new cd in my opinion.  I am not a fan of the changes to their sound and this is the first paramore cd that I had to remove tracks from my standard playlist and skip while listening to it in the car.  The final track &#34;future&#34; is the worst sounding track I have ever had the misfortune of owning.  I definitely hope whatever that noise was, is not going to be their future direction.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Great fit with my Nikon D90 camera. Used for a recent wedding. Used automatic mode for simplicity and was very pleased with the outcome.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love his music & lyrics.  Songs to pump you up & chill you out glad I went ahead and bought the whole CD.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Excellent knife, very well built. I've used it to cut down small trees, split firewood, pound in stakes and even pry my trailer hitch off the ball when it was stuck and I didn't have any other tools available. This knife is the real deal.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Nice game as a free app.  Some of the levels could have been longer, but overall entertaining.  Great way to fill a few minutes.
0783219598|5.0|This is a charming, funny, moving and most excellent story with James Cromwell and the other actors bringing the appopriate gravity and honesty yet levity to this very affecting story about Babe, a most special pig! It is great for all ages and for me is a classic film and one of a kind!
B004P2HMNM|5.0|It was fun putting it together and looks great.<br /><br />I just wish Lego would make a 6k piece so I would have something to work on for a longer period of time.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Daniel Craig is a more interesting (James Bond).  He actually looks like he can do the job. the writers have jettisoned a<br />quite a few of the cliche statements and actions that were present in the old movies.  It is less predictable and more entertaining.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great story, likeable characters and plenty of action. A great set up for the 3rd film in the rebooted series.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I appreciated the introduction to the life of Nikola Tesla, and was encouraged to think more deeply about the nature of creativity, but the text itself read like a high school report.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is an interesting book and I certainly enjoyed it. The story is well told, in a new, refreshing way. Loved the interview format, gives it a believable tone. But the insight, the social analysis... Not as deep as the author think they are. Not bad though, just not very good.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I loved the first two books of the series, but this one feel like the writer is looking it's way. The first book sets the laws and rules for the books, but I feel that the concept has been abuse. Mr. Martin's books go under the premise that in real life the good guys lose too, and can't always come out victorious. There is here the fault is starting show. I understand the concept, but he takes this to an extreme. They good guys are completely stupid in comparison to the ''bad'' guys. There is no real bad guys here because everyone acts according to their own plan, but the book give you a feeling, that only the spiteful come ahead and are so lucky...then author comes around doing 180 turn and every character that deserve to die...dies???<br /><br />After that turn the book leaves the \\"Starks must suffer\\" motto, and finally starts moving the story forward. He keeps on building the characters he has so masterfully created, like Tyrion, danearys, and Jaime. The writing is superb and is masterfully crafted, and even do the JOB changes from character to character, it chapters feel like a continuation. Little is left in the book's universe that is only showed to the readers knowledge and not other characters.<br /><br />Overall is fantastic book but it seems the series is going to serious of events that are just their for the shock value. I'm hoping the writer does not fall prey to this gimmicky trend.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Very engaging and fun read. Her method works by the way. I bought her book the joy of less and not only does it help me refocus it de stresses me.  Brings out more joy out of life.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Others have enumerated the many flaws of this popular trilogy but my summary says it all for me. I was aware that the novels were supposedly risque and involved some alternative sex but I expected real characters and story rather than a poorly written pornfest best suited for Penthouse forum.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Awesome reading. One of the best series that I have read. Keeps you on the edge of excitement. Must read.
B00021HBGS|5.0|we've had these for over a year and my boys still love them.  They stick to the tub and are cute.  My youngest likes to chew on them for teething and they hold up to his razor sharp baby teeth really well so far.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|An inspiring book that encourages the belief that anything with passion behind it can be something a person can make a (happy) living out of; I have recommended it to a few people. I like that it isn't another book on how to write up a business plan, but instead, how to wing it and lots of inspiring stories of people who have done just that. Positive message, ideal for the time we're living in.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great, easy read, love the plot twist! It is a real page turner and the unreliable narrators keep you guessing.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great continuation of the story. Nice progression of events. A must read for teens to adult. Keeps you on the edge of excitement.
B003O86FMW|5.0|More in-depth story of the lives of the hero's from District 12 and their struggle to defeat the Capitol. Exciting from the first page to the last. If you have read The Hunger Games, don't miss this one.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is very addicting!!!! Really enjoy the mini goals. Plus I am able to get my friends on to play as well.
