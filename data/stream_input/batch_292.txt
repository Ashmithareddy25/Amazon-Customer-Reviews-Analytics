B0000524CY|5.0|Okay.  Everyone already knows the plot, the outcome, and the history surrounding this movie.  I was fortunate to see it in the theater when it was re-released with all of the extended scenes, the spider walk, etc.  I even bought it when it was released on DVD.  From what I have seen from watching certain parts of the DVD, it is well worth the money.  Especially the new sound re-mix.  It's awesome on a surround sound system.  However, I still can't sit and watch it by myself!  After all of these years, it is still one of the scariest movies ever put on celluloid!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS ON!
B00005NWM3|5.0|I used to listen to that pop music stuff, which is a bunch of bull. I heard \\"how you remind me\\" on the radio, and got the damn song stuck in my head, so of course had to go out and buy the cd. When I first listened to the cd all the way through (keep in mind I was a newbie) I found it all to be a bit to grungy for my developed tastes for Christina Aguilera. I basically just listened to how you remind me over and over and over again. As I finally started to get sick of the crap known as rap and pop, I started listening to Nickelback more. I started to like the other songs (especially hangnail) and would listen to the cd over and over again. I have started to get into heavier rock bands, but I still think Silver Side Up is a great cd. I really think Chad Kroeger has a great voice, and some of his lyrics are really good. If you are a newbie to rock, or if you just like the softer stuff, this cd is for you!
B00004STPT|5.0|Actually...  it does.  It gets better and better every time you listen.  The Mediterranean themes of Gladiator seem somewhat bland or slow-moving upon the first listen, but play it again.  The Power of \\"Am I Not Merciful\\", \\"The Might of Rome\\", \\"The Battle\\", and \\"Barbarian Horde\\" leave you thirsting for blood and glory.  \\"Am I Not Merciful\\" is especially powerful, with breathtaking full chorus and brass that is quite intimidating.<br />The rest is equally good.  Soothing and uplifting best describes it.  Lisa Gerrard's voice in \\"Elysium\\" is one of the most haunting you will hear.  It calms you.  It expresses all the sadness and joy, fear and hope, you have ever felt, but says, \\"It will all be OK\\".  It is the kind of song you would want to die to.  And the softer side of Zimmer is heard in \\"Earth\\", \\"Strenth and Honor\\", and \\"Honor Him.\\"  These themes are filled with purpose and.... well, I'd be a fool to try and pin this music down with words any longer.<br />The tracks often continue from one to the next without breaking.  There are some cues from the film missing here; you may find them on the More Music CD and you may not.  Also the tracks are not always in the order they appeared in the film.  It's an emotional roller-coaster ride, one that was a huge factor in Gladiator's success at the Oscars.  <br />Unquestionably one of the top 10 Film Scores of all time.  Get this CD and you will not regret it.
0440237688|4.0|Lois Lowrys book The Giver is a book based on a community that lives in sameness to avoid conflict.  They have no memories of pain nor love which we hold dear.  They lived there lives unchanged until a young boy named Jonas is chosen to be the new Receiver of memories for the community.  During his training he begins to see how blind and ignorant the people in his community are only because they have no memories of the past.  Jonas starts to understand that you cannot truly learn if there are no memories of the past to teach you.  He realizes he must do something to help his community to see the error of the way they live now.<br /> This book inspires the mind to realize how important it is to learn from the past but not to try and take away individualism.  I believe this book is truly a one of a kind read that will defiantly open your eyes.
0316666343|5.0|It takes me a long time to finish a book.  I started reading this book one evening and found myself halfway through, trapped in it entirely.  Finished the book the very next night.  Not only is this book very well written, but it takes you to a place that few authors have explored before.  Have you ever imagined what is going through a person's mind right before their death?  In the case of this book, you nearly become one with Susie as she is enduring this initial torture, feel her relief knowing that she had survived and was going to make it through, then fall apart with her as the reality becomes true that she was not, in fact, going to make it at all.  Although the beginning is rather tough to take, you become entranced by Susie, her life after her death and have hope that you have loved ones gone by that watch after you and that you may be able to do the same someday.
B00005YXZH|4.0|The thing people need to understand about Wilco is that they care about one thing, pleasing themselves. That's actually a very good thing. You will never hear Wilco on your typical &quot;clear channel-style&quot; radio station and yet, you may not even hear them on a more independant alternative station. What sets these guys apart from the pack and what creates all this acclaim they are recieving is the simple fact that they create simpleness out of complexity. They are not afraid to throw in sounds and dynamic changes that normally would not make any sense and somehow they can blend it with off-key chords and come up with something inventive and pleasing to the ears. <BR>Don't get me wrong, there are songs that are strictly meant to be on-key straight forward ear candy and this album steers more toward this than most of their past work. With the expection of &quot;I'm the man who loves you&quot;, they don't have the cleverness that albums like SUMMERTEETH possess. Tweedy's vocals and lyrics aren't as sad and detailed as usual, but that also wins over a larger crowd.<br />HOTEL FOXTROT is a darn good album if you want something soothing and melodical with a little franticness thrown in. There is very little Wilco can mess up and this definetely is not a train wreck. If you want to feel something deep get their album SUMMERTEETH. If you want something in between, get this album.
B000089CJI|4.0|Now don't get me wrong. Although I'm a big fan of DCFC and All-Time Quarterback. I will never find something to like about an album just because the singer in it has proven to be amazing before. In fact I tend to judge a singer harsher if I love his earlier work.<br />However having said that, I have to say that this album is incredible. Ben Gibbard's voice soars over electronic heights that are at once both mesmerizing, and totally different from his work with Death Cab For Cutie. Although his voice still has it's characteristic fluctuating highs and lows, and the melody lines are (as always) incredible, the music is much more pop influenced on quite a few tracks, which he carries off perfectly. In fact Jimmy Tamborello (of Dntel and Figurine) creates perfect electronic nuances that Gibbards voice delicately touches as it glides above. Create a perfect combination of the two. <br />I have to say that lyrically I don't find postal service to be nearly as powerful, and image invoking as Ben's work with Death Cab For Cutie, especially Photo Album. However as Ben says on the sub pop site.<br />\\"Some of the songs are very much of a Death Cab mode, but people have been commenting, 'Wow, the lyrics are really different,'\\" explains Gibbard. \\"When somebody is just handing you music and you're supposed to sing over the top of it, it feels different than when you're sitting at home with a guitar trying to write a song.\\"<br />\\"'the district sleeps alone tonight,' 'brand new colony' and 'this place is a prison' are pretty much the only songs that border on autobiographical,\\" he continues. \\"But everything else is just kind of daydreaming and coming up with ideas for songs that aren't necessarily based in reality, and I think that was a lot more fun for me to do because I'd never really done that before. It didn't feel right for all the songs to be break-up-type songs - they just felt more like the kind of songs that you would want to dance to and you wouldn't want to have a lyric that's super heavy, especially on 'such great heights.' I think 'such great heights' is the first time I've ever written a positive love song, where it's a song about being in love and how it's rad, rather than having your heart broken.\\"<br />So although the fun, pop influence is definitely different from the beautiful darkness of much of Photo Album, and We Have The Facts. Songs like \\"This Place is a Prison\\" (One of my favorites on the album) are there as well, a beautiful mellow song of great intensity, with a much darker feel to it. <br />All in all, this album pulls off with great finesse an unlikely, but at the same time totally fitting mix between indie and electronica. Definitely recommended for anyone into DCFC, Grandaddy, Stars, as well as anyone that appreciates good music, or wants to get into something new.<br />Notable Tracks:<br />This Place is a Prison<BR>Such Great Heights<BR>We Will Become Silhouettes
B0000029AP|5.0|All the songs are great.  Here are my ratings of every song in order from best to worst.<br />1. No More No More- a history of the band, love the line \\"Baby I'm a Dreamer\\"<BR>2.  Toys in the Attic-This song rocks, great guitar work on this one, fast paced song about leaving the things you love behind.<BR>3.Sweet Emotion-their biggest hit ever, a song Steven wrote about a bandmates lover I think, amazing guitar riffs<BR>4.  Walk this way- catchy song and riffs, mainly about sex drugs and rock and roll<BR>5.  Adam's Apple- its about a Adam and Eve and the creation of man, good song, the guitar solo rocks<BR>6.  You see me cryin- a beautiful ballad, Steven must have wrote this about a girl<BR>7.  Round and Round- this song rocks, I think it almost sounds like an 80's rock hair band song, sound alot like heavy metal, definitaly the heaviest song on the album.<BR>Uncle Salty- I dont know what this one is about, it is not heavy 8.has a catch little guitar hook<BR>9.  Big Ten Inch Record-my least favorite song on the record, even though it gets more airplay than every song on this record besides walk this way and sweet emotion.  An old school rock cover,old school blues.
0452282152|5.0|what a trip this was...the author actually made me believe that she was the girl with the pearl ear ring herself.<BR>a lot of subtle stuff going on there...glimpses of society, feelings, relationships...lots of hints that allowed me to fill in the blanks as i saw fit.<BR>this is a \\"must buy\\" book!<BR>enjoy.
0060273224|5.0|One of the best series that I have ever read was Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. But it still couldn't hold a candle to Garth Nix's Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen series. Each one got better and better until it ended with the smash novel Abhorsen. When I picked up Sabriel I read until I was finished which took a mere 7 hours, which seemed like 7 minutes as the book was so amazing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who liked His Dark Materials, you will be astounded!
0385474547|4.0|Umofia was a very religious and great African tribe with many wise and respected men. One of these respected men was Okonkwo. Okonkwo was Unoka's son. Unlike many other sons who respected their fathers in Umofia, Okonkwo hated his father. He hated his lack of strength, his failure, and the fact that he had not taken a title in Umofia during his life. Okonkwo however had taken a title and became a well known and respected man at a very young age. Okonkwo lived in his own farm with his three wives and children. Okonkwo and the elder men of Umofia were called for a meeting. It was concerning the death of a clansman's wife of Umofia, who had been killed by another tribe. As compensation for the loss a young man and a virgin was brought to Umofia. Ikemefuna, the young man, was decided by the elders to stay in Okonkwo's care. Okonkwo and his family soon grew fond of the boy. Nwoye, Okonkwo's son, and Ikemefuna became very close and came to see each others as brothers. As the years passed Okonkwo was able to grow a good harvest. Nwoye was becoming a man in Okonkwo's eyes and this was because of Ikemefuna who had taught him so much. Ikemefuna had spent three years in Okonkwo's household. One morning a group of elders came to Okonkwo's house and called Ikemefuna to be sent back to his homeland. Nwoye cried over this. Okonkwo, Ikemefuna, and the elders set for the journey. After a long walk Ikemefeuna had been killed by the men and by Oknokwo as a sacrifice.When Okonkwo returned home Nwoye knew Ikemefuna had been killed. Nwoye feared his father after that night.<BR>Umofia was at mourning for Ezeudo's death and everyone in the village attended his funeral. During th traditional ceremony a cry of agony was heard it was Ezeudo's son. He layed dead on the floor. Okonkwo's gun had accidentally exploded and a piece of iron had pierced the boy's heart. Okonkwo's only option was to flee with his family to Mbanta, his mother's homeland. He would be able to return to Umofia after sevenyears. He build his own home and settled in Mbanta for seven years. During these seven years a white man had been traveling to every tribe spreading christanity. The white man and his followers built their own churches and schools. Among these followers was Nwoye. He became a christian and Okonkwo disowned him. Okonkwo returned to Umofia, but it was differnt then the way he had left it seven years ago. Okonkwo was angered and saddened by how christianity had changed his homeland. The only answer Okonkwo saw was war.<BR>A masquerader who impersonated one of the ancestors spirits of the village destroyed the church. A couple of days after the destruction of the church the District comissioner of the church sent for the leaders of Umofia to meet in his headquarters. Among the leaders was Okonkwo. They were held captive until they agreed to pay 200 pounds of cowries as a fine. They were held prisoners and were whipped and mistreated. After their release a town meeting was held and Okonkwo feared his tribe's lack of strenth to call a war. The district comissioner's messengers were sent to sop the meeting. Okonkwo drew his machete and killed the man. The comissioner and other clansmen arrived at Okonkwo's home and found him dangling from a tree. He had comitted suicide.
B00007LL7O|4.0|Stratovarius showed an evolution into this Cd. Sounds like Angra and takes orchestral pieces mixed with their characteristic raw power metal. A fantastic album....but Elements Part 2 could be even better.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD.  It is so relaxing and timeless.  It has an instantly classic feel to it, as if it has been around forever and will always be.  Smooth as silk!
B000002GJH|3.0|The etiology of this one is well known, with the non-singing members of Pearl Jam joining with Soundgarden's Chris Cornell for an affecting tribute to Mother Love Bone's Andrew Wood.  Not surprisingly, the album's finest moment is when Eddie Vedder turns up to provide a growling counterpoint to the soaring heights of Cornell's voice in &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;.  The two titans of grunge vocals on one cut.  That alone is worth the price of this CD.<br />If you're into extended noodling jam sessions of the highest quality, you'll love the 10 minutes of &quot;Reach Down&quot;.  The rest of the cuts are tighter, and it's nice to hear Cornell doing a lot more actual singing rather than the caterwauling that made so much of Soundgarden's output such an acquired taste.<br />Even more appealing is the fact that, despite the obvious standouts of &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot; and &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, the album is remarkably cohesive and devoid of filler, unless the middle section of &quot;Reach Down&quot; strikes you as just a bit too trippy.  As a result, this CD gives you more to chew on than your typical Soundgarden album, but not as much as early Pearl Jam.  Regardless, it is essential for a complete understanding of the development of the Seattle sound.
0446605409|4.0|I like the DeMille characters. John Corey is the kind of character that pops up in Vietnam as an officer or an enlisted man, on airplanes, or working for \\"the Company.\\" If you like that style of protaganist, wise-cracking, irreverant, rough around the edges, funny but self-effacing nonetheless, you'll enjoy the heck out of Plum Island. If you don't, go back to LeCarre and Furst, two distinguished authors who write great novels and where nowhere in their body of work appear anyone even remotely resembling John Corey.<br />Corey is a New York City Detective recuperating from a near fatal shoot out. He's staying out on Long Island where DeMille grew up and still lives, I understand, in far posher environs.<br />Corey, like all good protagonists, very reluctantly gets drawn into a web of intrigue, lies, arrogance, sex and murder that mark all DeMille (and all good) mysteries.<br />If this is your cup of tea, or glass of beer, or flute of champagne, you're in for a real treat.
0060916540|5.0|I disagree with some of the book reviews.  It doesn't make me want to climb, nor make me think that mountain climbers are sane -- not in the least.<br />But this is a true-adventure yarn of such compelling interest that even couch potatoes and non-readers should love it.  It is unbelievable, an unbelievable tale of survival, and it is a first -hand account (he wrote his own story!).<br />What this book is really about is the human spirit, body, and mind for SURVIVAL.<br />It is a fantastic read.
B00005JLO2|4.0|Entertaining to watch, but a little disappointed in the character development.  I enjoyed the 1977 version, for whats its worth, but this version is good, and well worth buying!
0316666343|1.0|This book is a feel-bad/feel-good adolescent fantasy that somehow through a blast of publisher's hype managed to glug up the throats of the literary critics and win their praise to become a bestseller.  But where in heaven have their literary standards gone?  This is a 328-page Hallmark card for adolescent girls and not the literary wonder they proclaim. The only wonder is the number of people who got suckered into buying this sappy comic book vision of loss and grief. <BR>It's characters are dull, flat and their motivations poorly conceived (e.g., the alcohol-soaked grandmother with the good heart); the dialogue doesn't sound like real people talking; the plot is clumsy, jumping years ahead in the second half only because the author didn't know what else to do; its style is pretty at best, but usually saccharine and forced.  The contrivances are embarrassing (e.g., the wife abandoning her family then returning after 5 years because her husband had a heart attack). ... Give us a break, Ms. Sebold!  And grow up, critics: You are suppose to know better, to recognize sophomoric, sentimental slop from literature.
B0000000LI|5.0|This CD worths 5 stars.  But I strongly recommand to buy the video tape also.  I rated the video tape 6 stars :)
0064409422|5.0|I read this book in class time. This book felt to me specially. Because this book is my first experience that I read foreign language book.<BR>I think this book is good for little children. Lucy, who is main character, is very strong girl. She go to strange world. alone. but she doesnt have anything to fear. If any other children are in like this situation, they will cry or find their parents. So children learn bravery.<BR>Also, children learn curiosity. Because Narnia is new world, In imagination. Although main character and main story is same. Narnia is different from person to person. So children can make their Narnia. Probably It is more interesting and fun. If I read it when I was young. I wish to recommend this book to parents who has little children.<BR>There is a many other useful thing for child. For example trust, friendship, bravery and so on.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I saw this movie as part of my beginner Mandarin class, and I had to buy it. Not only is the Mandarin easy to follow (which is not authentic, really, but certainly helped me) but the story is touching and the scenery is spectacular.<br />A work of joy and nuance.
0823003035|5.0|I love The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition by Anthony Ryder.  Buy it and you will find that you can live (draw) without.  I would probably buy any book written by him.
B000089RV6|5.0|OK, firstly, AC/DC's catalogue is now going through Epic/Sony, after 20+ years of being in the Warner family.  Now, hearing these new reissues, esp. \\"Back In Black\\", is like having a wool blanket removed from the speakers.  These are taken from the original 2-track masters, first time ever, and the difference really shows!!  This doesn't sound like an album recorded 23 years ago!!  It sounds like it was recorded just yesterday!!  As a result, you can file AC/DC's \\"Back In Black\\" under the category TIMELESS PURE UNADULTERATED ROCK N ROLL!!<br />Produced by UBERPRODUCER Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, aka Mr Shania Twain, this album, and the 1 before + one after, are what gave him his reputation as a producer.  As later with Def Leppard, Foreigner and especially Shania Twain, Mutt's trademarks are the boosting of the middleranges and emphasis on lead vocals + backing GANG vocals.  This really shows on BIB, and you can hear this influence on those later records.  Basically, the guy deserves his wealth, as he knew what he was doing, and this album is just very well-done, period.<br />The band is at the top of their game as well, which really was a miracle, considering the circumstances.  The great Bon Scott dying tragically, and getting the whiskey-soaked Brian Johnson, formerly of Geordie, to take his place.  This coulda been a disaster bar none, but Brian was a perfect fit, still with the band to this day, the album was a masterpiece, songwriting, performance-wise, and production-wise, and this all happened as their popularity just exploded!!<br />Every song is a gem, a perfect example of pure, pull-no-punches, back-to-basics, bluesy rock + roll.  It seems like every song here was a hit too, as each one had it's share of airplay on rock radio, plus 2 singles made the US Top 40!!  The songs never grow old either, don't sound dated or show their age.  Every song works on their own as a single, yet flow masterfully from beginning to end as a complete work.  Basically, the album was flawless, is flawless, and will continue to BE flawless!!  It's one of those albums, where if someone asks you what rock + roll is, you can play him/her this album, and you can say \\"here's your answer\\".  From the doomy opening \\"Hells Bells\\" to the catchy energetic \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" to the golddigger putdown \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" to the raunchy \\"Givin The Dog A Bone\\" to the slow seductive \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\" to the classic 1-2 punch \\"Back In Black\\" + \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" (covered by Anastacia + Celine Dion??!!?? on VH1 Divas Las Vegas) to the cool \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" to the catchy \\"Shake A Leg\\" and ending with the statement of purpose \\"Rock + Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", with the line \\"It's Just Rock + Roll, yeah\\", it's just a perfect album, period!!<br />Buy it and treasure it.  Guaranteed, in 50 years, it will sound shiny and new.  Believe me, if you think pop music is all plastic ... these days, all manufactured and just junk, pop this baby on, and your faith in rock + roll will be instantly renewed.<br />May AC/DC keep on going and going and going....
0786200553|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, as it brought me happiness as well as grief within its visually colorful scriptures.  Jonas, a boy of only twelve, discovers that he is destined to do more than what meets the naked eye, no pun intended.  His community, known for its equality, or rather today this can be labeled as communism, assigns Jonas to work as the keeper of memories, where he is to deal with the pain and strife that the rest of the population does not deal with.  This is supposedly done to ensure the happiness of his clan.  Ever so slowly Jonas realizes that his life had been shielded from reality.  Jonas had been lied to about what life was supposed to be like, and in this trap of bland grays, Jonas decided that he had to escape.<br />I felt that Louis Lowery almost perfectly described this utopia in which Jonas resided.  Everything was explained in utmost detail to give everyone the distinct view of life through Jonas's eyes. Lowery's use of allusion to the topic of Communism was also a powerful topic that I felt was delicately embedded within the text.  Very craftily it was used to depict a community where everything was `provided and cared-for equally,' but not necessarily `perfect.'  I would recommend this book to any age group.  It is simple to read for any age, but what you get out of the book lies in how deeply you understand its levels.  ...
0060930187|4.0|A scared loss of understanding and reality are all that serve as the backbone to the what must be quasi-autobiographical tale of Plath.  When reading, you can almost hear the whispers of depression and anguish in between the typing on the page.  I found the book extremely interesting and yearning to wonder how someone so talented (see also E. Wurtzel) could feel so horribly bad just livign out life.  The book is a pre-cursor to the many books on depression out today, but offers its knowledge through a story of fiction and undoubtedly, of the happenings of the well-known author.
B00006JU7T|5.0|After years of having to live with the previous VHS release, with its sides cropped and its colors faded, I was more than pleased to finally see &quot;Serpico&quot; as originally intended, in widescreen, and gorgeous Technicolor.  The score and audio tracks have also been cleaned up in this Paramount re-release, and it's worth every cent.<br />Sidney Lumet is often thought of as an actors' director, more so than a cinematic genius, but &quot;Serpico&quot; more than delivers in both arenas.  Al Pacino's portrayal of the eccentric Frank Serpico -- a NYPD cop of unyielding integrity -- is one of his best roles ever.  He's animated, tough and very human in his role, and one can sense that a lot of the real Serpico rubbed off on him.  &quot;Serpico&quot; also boasts an excellent supporting cast. Aside from Tony Roberts, who was already well-known from his roles in Woody Allen movies, take a look at these then-unknowns, who would soon either make it big, or be regulars in cop and crime movies:  Alan North, Jack Kehoe, Tony Lo Bianco, Richard Foronjy, F. Murray Abraham, Judd Hirsch.<br />Director Lumet is featured in the two &quot;making of&quot; featurettes that are included on the DVD, and it's fascinating hearing his method of shooting and his and producer Martin Bregman's reminisences.  I had only wished that Pacino was also included, but since I don't buy DVDs for the bonus material, not a big loss for me.<br />This is one of the best transfers of a preservation print from the 1970s, an era of notoriously quickly deteriorating color negatives.  Thank you, Paramount, for giving &quot;Serpico&quot; the TLC it deserved.

B00005R6FC|4.0|I don´t know why this album was released as HELL BENT FOR LEATHER in the U.S. and as KILLING MACHINE in Europe.<br />Anyway, this is a fine, very fine,  Priest record. It has a great variety of styles, and all of them work (I particularly do not like the weird EVIL FANTASIES, one of the most strange things Priest ever recorded). Their drummer at the time, Les Binks, had great feeling, precision and rhythm.<br />It is indeed a departure from the style of STAINED CLASS. It´s really the beginning of their \\"leather phase\\", but this is not wrong. The band got heavier, the songs got shorter, and a whole new group of fans embraced the band. <br />AS for this remaster, the bonus tracks are fillers, nothing that would make anyone sad had they not been released...
6302636779|2.0|It is quite an entertaining for a secular viewers but rather a very disturbing thing to the soul of those who understand what it means for taking vow of obedience in the religious order. To me, the movie is about an ambitious nurse who takes advantage of the religious life for her own fame.

From the rocking John Lennon / Elton John rocker 'Whatever Gets You Through the Night', to the scathing 'Steel &amp; Glass', to the hauntingly beutiful 'Bless You', to the fun little throw-away 'Ya-ya' (featuring the recording debut of Julian Lennon - on drums).  This album is full of great music.  This album was put together while John waited for Phil Spector to recover from an accident in order to resume recording the 'Rock and Roll' album.  Therefore, the backing musicians are basically the same talented ones that adorn that record. The only draw back is that the CD cover can't reproduce the collection of John Lennon at age 11 artwork in the same manner as the vinyl could.
0452257743|5.0|I received this book in high school as a gift and it really struck a chord. I was surprised to read that it is no longer published because of incidents concerning Rage. King always seems to get it right, was he a geek in HS too? I have since ordered the book again, surely I lent it out to someone who didn't appreciate it as much as I did, and I plan on rereading the whole book again.
B000002IGV|4.0|Altough it possess one of the worst covers ever for a metal album, there is no denial that STAY HUNGRY is a gem of hard rock / metal.<br />The trick here is that Twisted Sister, even with the long hair and Snider´s eyelid and makeup, was not a typical hair metal band. THeir lyrics were better, the attitude somewhat different, the musicianship also better and harder. Of course they profited over the whole MTV videos vibe of the time, but that was a natural course to follow, unfortunately.<br />STAY HUNGRY is one hell of a strong album. The nine songs are good, there is no throaway. It´s not a masterpiece by any standard, but it´s simply very good.
B000002BFZ|4.0|...maybe even the start of a new rock era, period.  Alright, so fans always have really mixed opinions on the band's fourth release, No Code.  Some absolutely love it, and think it's better than all their other releases, before or since.  Some absolutely hate it, saying it's too diverse and inconsistent to even be considered a 'true' Pearl Jam record.  I'm somewhere in between, but much closer to the first preference.  No Code is a far cry from their 'grungier', more guitar solo-driven days of Ten, which will disappoint some (casual/close-minded) fans.  However, compared to the relative disaster that was Vitalogy, this record is a godsend.  I feel it redeemed the band, and paved the way for where they're headed now, musically.  <br />Before I delve deeper into why this is such a great album, I'll point out the few gripes I have with it.  First off, there is some truth to the 'inconsistency' complaint some fans cite...to say it's a diverse album just doesn't cover it.  It's got an incredibly wide range of songs on here, which is usually a blessing, but also produces some of the lesser-enjoyable songs like &quot;Smile&quot; and the laid-back opener &quot;Sometimes&quot;.  While this album has a lot of really great hits, it's got a couple of serious misses, too.  The song order is sometimes a little kooky, too...it seems hastily thrown together, and it's their only album that doesn't have a really strong sense of flow to me.  Sembelence wavers throughout (exception: the transition from &quot;Lukin&quot; to &quot;Present Tense&quot;, more on that later).  Other than that, though, you're dealing with a damn near immaculate record.<br />One of the reasons No Code is so outstanding is because it showcases all the members at their full-on best, both working together, and alone.  Jack's opening floor tom beats on &quot;In My Tree&quot; are beautifully tribal, and his drums are exceptional on the other tracks, as well.  Stone's vocal debut on &quot;Mankind&quot; is a fun change of pace, and as usual, his rhythm guitar parts are as interesting as ever.  Mike shines in full form, both in solos and riffs, the intoxicating &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and frenetic &quot;Habit&quot; both readily come to mind.  Jeff's basslines are as smooth and subtle as ever, but his solo on &quot;Present Tense&quot; is particularly amazing...it really proves how under-rated he is as a player, as well as a member of the band.  And Eddie, well...he's really better than ever on here, I think.  He ranges from his trademark soft-hearted croons on &quot;Off He Goes&quot; to the fierce, blistering screams of &quot;Lukin&quot;, and I really think he showcases his best vocal work on No Code, bar none.  Lyrically, he's better than ever, as well...the songwriting here can be both incredibly introspective or commentative, sometimes within the same song.  Overall, the band has never been in better shape.  And the songs on this album prove it.<br />In my mind, No Code has some of the most sincere, inspiried work that Pearl Jam has ever produced.  The moods range from mellow, down-to-earth, and sullen (&quot;Off He Goes&quot;) to energetic, frenetic, and charged (&quot;Red Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Lukin&quot;) to anywhere in between (the solitary rant of &quot;I'm Open&quot; is somewhere in there).  It's got what I hold to be their best love song ever, &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; (forget &quot;Betterman&quot;!), as well as some of their most angry, caustic material in years, too.  I think the best example of emotional spectrum changes is when the breif, insane, Black Flag-influenced &quot;Lukin&quot; transitions immediately into the chilling, bittersweet &quot;Present Tense&quot; (my personal favorite song on the album).  The seugeway is no less than phenomenal.  Overall, though, after listening to this album, you leave with a calm sense of warmth and appreciation for what you've just been given.  What's that, exactly?  One spectacular album.<br />If you're new to P Jam, or just gaining interest in them, do NOT make this your first album purchase!  For new fans, I'd recommend buying either Ten and/or Live on Two Legs first.  In fact, it should probably be one of your final purchases (along with Binaural and Vitalogy).  But rest-assured, once you discover this beauty, you won't be sorry you waited for it.  I don't think it's the world's best introduction to Pearl Jam, but it's certainly one of their best releases, and one that is often over-looked by more casual fans and record critics alike.  Ignore the others.  If you're into Eddie and the guys, you'll love this baby.
B000084T18|5.0|okay this cd is worth the cashflow but it's nowhere near on the same pages as the chronic, straight outta compton, or enter the wu still a good cd and 50's rhymes are tight and yes he disses ja fool on here and those 2 have some serious beef.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Well, I was expecting something more - well, alternative, to be honest. Not a rehash of unused RATM riffs and Soundgarden lyrics. A lot of hair metal throwbacks...like a space-age Dio or Poison or whatever...I don't listen to those bands so I wouldn't be able to be accurate. Some songs start off with a bang the first time you hear them (like the oh-so-overplayed Cochise, and Show me how to Live, Like a Stone to name a few) but don't retain what other good records do...sustain that bang. Old Soundgarden records could do that. RATM did it uptil the second album. Nirvana damn near perfected the \\"second listen's gonna REALLY get ya\\". Audioslave, unfortunately, do not. Which is a disappointment. Doesn't matter though. Get Audioslave. There's some good music to be found here.
B000084T18|5.0|I have been waiting for 50 to drop for 3 years now &amp; to think he did it w/ Shady/Aftermath...sick! This CD isn't the greatest in lyrical quality that 50 has to offer (Check out Guess Who's Back), but I think he knows that as well. He can't explode right away (look at Em).  The production is all around excellent (aside from the Megahertz song). Dre has a few nice beats (In da Club, Heat, If I Can't &amp; Back Down)...but I truly found 50 at his best over slower paced, not so dark tracks. Like Many Men &amp; High All the Time (the 2 best tracks on the CD). His content is so rich on these 2 songs you can picture every word &amp; give it up to production too (High All the Time brings back memories of Ghetto Qua'ran). He's a new taste of grimey &amp; gangsta that is so refreshing in this watered down state of hip-hop. He has such an ability to flow with whatever he's given (which maybe why the production seems so hot...a ill flow w/ no beat is incomplete/it's like a stick-up kid/runnin' round without no heat). The only real downfall to the album is Patiently Waiting...whoa! Let me explain...only cuz Em rips the track way harder than 50... He just seemed to put no effort into that song. Em certainly kills it though. It's ok though...50 rips Don't Push Me &amp; Em falls off a little (nice balance). The really nice thing about 50 is even his radio friendly songs are still gangsta. In da Club is easily one of the best cuts on the CD &amp; Wanksta is hot to. This is a CD to own, this is the start of somethin' huge. Dre/Em/50/Cube...watch out! You better cop this...50 is the future (just watch)!
B000002HRE|2.0|Alright, so there's little argument that Metallica were the indisputed kings of heavy metal throughout the 80's, right?  From Kill 'Em All up to the Black Album, they produced some of the finest metal the world has ever known, and that's not something easily overlooked.  But in the mid-nineties, after a nearly five-year break between the Black Album and Load, something happened.  Something changed in the band, and whatever it was, their songwriting suffered because of it.  There's a general consensus that any Metallica album released with any short-haired members of the band isn't worth listening to.  However, unlike most fans of the band, I actually liked Load...it's one of my favorites, even.  For me, the true end of Metallica's heyday began with the release of their follow-up album, Reload.<br />Simply put, while Reload is not an altogether terrible album, it just does NOT live up to the standard they'd set for themselves early on in their career.  It doesn't deliver the goods you'd come to expect from the masters of metal.  In a way, Metallica are sort-of like the Beatles of heavy music...even at their worst, Metallica are better than most metal bands at their best.  They're the originators, and topping them now is no everyday job.  However, with Reload, one must consider what today's metal scene might be like if the band had simply called it quits one or two albums earlier.  Maybe we'd be better off without this record.<br />All the songs aren't bad on their own, let me make that clear.  \\"Fuel\\", the introductory track of the album, presents one of the most furious, aggressive, and out-and-out great songs the band has ever recorded.  Nothing wrong with that.  \\"The Memory Remains\\" has just enough experimentation to still be listenable, and other tracks like \\"Devil's Dance\\" and \\"Attitude\\" harken back to the band's earlier, more successful days.  But other than that, this record is seriously lacking in stand-out hits or enjoyable songs.  Period.  When you ask a Metallica fan what his favorite songs are, chances are he's going to name something off of Master of Puppets or Justice For All, not Reload.  Why?  It just doesn't have that many good songs on it.  It's that simple.<br />One of the things that I find most aggrivating about this album is the fact that the band refused to abandon the 'country-metal' grit sound that dampered a few songs on Load.  However, unlike those tracks on Load, which I could stomach and enjoy a little, the country-fried songs on Reload are simply corny or unimaginative.  Kirk Hammett should NOT be forced to play a song that sounds more like Lonestar rather than Megadeath.  The band compromised a lot of their metal sound for a more subtle, and eventually more bland style of songwriting on more than a few songs on Reload.  The entire album suffers because of it.<br />Another thing that's noticeable after merely one listen of Reload...the originality and spontaneity of the band has dwindled severly.  If ever there was a doubt that their glory days were behind them by the time they released this album, one need only listen to track four to erase all suspicion.  \\"Unforgiven II\\", while certainly not the worst track on the album, is largely forgettable (and downright 'unforgiveable' itself) when compared to the original \\"The Unforgiven\\" on 1991's self-titled album.  Like the majority of Reload, it simply doesn't come up to par with the rest of the band's material.  The guitar parts often seem boring and uninspired, and the lyrics dwell in a lack of passion and overuse of cliches.  The mighty have not only fallandered in this case, they've undeniably fallen from their own pedestals.<br />Perhaps dedicated fans could blow off Reload as a mere fluke of an album, one wrong turn in an otherwise bright road of such a great band.  I don't, however.  Look at the handful of (new) material the band has released since Reload...with the possible exception of \\"No Leaf Clover\\", on S&M, it seems as if the songwriting ability that once seemed so sweet and sensational for the entire band has evaporated into thin air.  All-in-all, Reload comes off as one big, long, and for the most part BORING garbled song by one formerly great band.  Maybe it's time for the boys to call it a day.  This album certainly seems proof enough of that.  Like the name of their most recent single release, perhaps they should just 'disappear' from the metal scene entirely, so we can enjoy their older material without the taint of such blasphemous newer releases.
B00003CXAA|5.0|All three are great in there own way. The first 2 are the best. I think the third one was almost pretty good, but it ended badly. It is not just about the mob but also the Sicilain family from Corleone which Vito Corleone has migrated all by himself and starts a life in the mob. Marlon Brando is great as Don Vito Corleone. Robert De Niro played a great role in the 2nd one. He played as the young Vito Corleone in the flashbacks in the 2nd one. Al Pacino is michael corleone and he is great. Robert Duvall plays the part as the lawyer. This movie will remind you of the 1940s mob bosses and if you are Italian you will love it. Alot of italian songs and tarantellas in the movies.
B000002MP2|5.0|This CD is great. It is Green Day at their best. Not only does this album have some of Green Day's best hits like &quot;Longview&quot; and &quot;Basket Case&quot;, but it has many other great, original songs that never got a chance on the radio. From the beginning, this CD takes you on a trip of pop punk at its best, with smart lyrics and rapid music. It's the perfect CD to get you going. It really doesn't matter what anybody says, because this CD is a must have.
B00005O5CM|5.0|My Favorite Movie!! Reese Witherspoon is a wonderful actress &amp; this movie is so free spirited and fun loving! Ditzy I'd say (my kinda movie, hehehe!), and very Cute! It also shows how Ele didn't care what other people thought of her and she reached her dreams! She may have gone after them for the wrong reasons but it ended great! You like Reese you'll love this movie-a cute movie and a good laugh!
0793518326|4.0|This is good to have for practicing the guitar.  One great song after another, and the songs are at various skill levels.  No matter where you're at in your development, there is a song for you to play.  It is obvious that the folks who prepared this book spent an extraordinary amount of time transcribing the songs.<br />But, the book ain't perfect.  First off, the text is quite small, and people with vision problems may have to really squint to read the musical notation.  Even I have to sometimes stop what I am doing and scrutinize the notation.  <br />Second, the authors provide notation for every instrument featured on every Beatles song.  So for example, there is transcription for mellotron, organ, flute and whatever.  The book also provides guitar tab for people who can't read music.  These extra notations mean there are less measures per page, and thus more page turning when you are playing a song. <br />I know of no other book that includes every Beatles song.  So this is the one to get.

0060090367|5.0|This is the best book!!  I haven't run across a book this good and funny in years!  I really enjoyed the character and the story line.  I'm running out to buy all the other books from this author.
1573225517|5.0|Absolutely the best book i have read.  It is comical beyond genious.  It has the most accurate perspective from a male mind ever.  Amazing.
B00007LL7O|5.0|I'am finnish music fan and I have been fan of Stratovarius for many years. This album left me simply breathless yes it is little proge for the band but how cares it works. My favourite track is Learning to fly and weaker tracks were Papillon and Stratofortress, but after listening to them they were also good songs. The theme of the album Elements is big and powerful so the music's have to be also big and powerful. There's lot's of Orchestra and choir arrangements and this time they really are beautiful and big especially in songs Soul of a vagabond(this is a geat tribute to old Dio and Black Sabbath), Fantasia, Papillion, Elements and A drop in the ocean(simply a daydreaming this will light up your day). Stratovarius has used Orchestra and choir arrangements since Episode(1996) and that is the one of the many things which gives this band so unique sound. If you are trully a friend of this kind music this album you must buy. But also people how havent listent this kind of music add this album to your record collections it is a classic.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Quick, action-packed movie.  Awesome indeed.  I will now read the book, i hear its better.
0062502182|5.0|With the amount of life lessons that come from The Alchemist, it would be easy for the author's writing to come across as cheesy, or even arrogant.  Quite to the contrary, the story is written beautifully and is far from cheesy.  Short and sweet, The Alchemist gets to the point and doesn't waver through the last page of the epilogue.
B000084T18|4.0|this cd is definitely a must have at the moment.... with 2 number one songs and a few others that add to it, its a really good cd, plus u'll be lookin like a scrub if you aint listenin to in da club.
B00005JKG7|3.0|This is John Carpenter's follow-up to Halloween (one of the best movies ever).  This movie doesn't quite measure-up.  It's scary, but it does not have memorable characters.  It's a creepy and in-your-face horror movie.<br />The extras on the DVD, like on The Thing, tell you everything you'd want to know about the movie, and TOO MUCH MORE.  A huge problem with DVD extras is that it tends to treat every film as if it were Citizen Kane.  It could use a lot of editing.  Listening to the principals talk about the film, it's difficult to tell if they think it is a success or not.  Unfortunately, every time I've seen John Carpenter lately (in person or on TV) he seems like he's smoked a few too many doobies to ever form a coherent thought again.  It's a shame because he had so much talent.
B00003CY0V|5.0|good film, nice effects, strong acting.

B000002GWN|5.0|I grew up listening to Joni Mitchell since my sisters played her albums almost constantly, so yes I am biased on my opinion of this artist. Still, how can some people say they prefer the regular recordings to these jazzed, lovely versions? Fools! The reviewer who skips over the last two numbers is a nut!. My favorites ARE the last two songs- \\"Jericho\\" and \\"Love or Money.\\" \\"Jericho\\" is beautifully sung and quite moving while \\"Love or Money\\" is rocking and played exceptionally well by the jazzy musicians. A friend of mine who had only heard the slow version of \\"Woodstock\\" was blown away by the upbeat, live version . In all of the songs, Joni comes across as an exceptionally talented singer! Her later live recordings don't stand up because of the songs chosen. I like later Joni Mitchell music, but this was the peak of her creative energy, when she still had the folk sound but was experimenting with jazzy, more upbeat tempos. What a great CD, EASILY deserving 5 stars!!!!!
0553812173|4.0|Erikson gives you no time to get your bearings in this book -- it starts with a short prologue of background and then the main story starts up in the middle of a decades-long conflict played out both in the mortal realm and among the various deities (Ascendants). This series logs the lives of Erikson's characters, and those affected by them, during the various wars of the Malazan empire -- thus the \\"Book of the Fallen\\" concept that is essentially a Black Company-like annals of the people who die, are killed, are raised to divinity or lowered to squalor in the wars of Malazan. <br />Erikson is straightforward in his writing, not much excess wordiness, because there is a lot of story he is trying to tell, and he is working on a broader, more far-reaching story than any author of the serial fantasy genre. Nonetheless, despite the huge storyline, Erikson peoples his story with memorable characters who are noble, ignoble, interesting and demonic, and often all those qualities together. The forces of \\"Dark\\" and \\"Light\\" are, however, not delineated because no \\"side\\" is clearly defined. <br />This series is work (and not just in obtaining copies of the books, which do not have a US publisher but do have UK and Canada publishers). Each volume is more than 700 pages and filled with graphic details of the horrors of supernatural war, difficulties of superhuman effort, the evil of complete betrayal and (especially in Deadhouse Gates, volume 2) the enormity of heroic sacrifice. Gardens of the Moon is therefore \\"thicker\\" than its 700+ pages. Nonetheless, it is very interesting, well-written and highly imaginative. A fine addition to the genre.
B00005JLXC|5.0|I am very impressed. One of the story lines that make's you wish that you could be the hero. Have the skills and qualitys they do, the \\"fearless\\" mind set that have no matter what. DareDevil portrayed By Ben A. played well with the visaud of the character. His dark and troubled mind clearly showed through the characters eyes. I strongly earge you to watch this film, if you are a Marvel Comics fan.
B000001FSU|4.0|No two Anthrax CDs sound alike... State of Euphoia eschews much of the insane thrash heard on Among the Living for commercially oriented song structures. There are still plenty headbanging moments and every chorus is catchy... the songs stick with you. Any fan of the Belladonna era should have this CD already. <br />Who Cares Wins and Be All End All (both singles) are the heavier tracks... the former futuring an quality verse/chorus riff and excellent vocalwork by Mr. Belladonna. The other classic on here is Antisocial, their Trust cover (Nick McBrain's old band) and breakout hit. My only problem is that songs like Make Me Laugh and Now It's Dark, however fun they may be, are a little lightweight. The riffs and lyrics are cheesy as hell.. \\"now it's dark! i can't see! don't you fXXXing look at me! you don't care about anything!\\". Scott Ian is not exactly Shakespeare but these are really lame. <br />State of Euphoria is a cool album no doubt, but Persistence of time and Among the Living are better. Get those and White NOise first.
B000088E6D|4.0|This debut cd by Michael Buble is a real listening pleasure.  He covers the standards with such ease....his voice is much smoother than Harry Connick Jr. but lacks much of the emotion of Sinatra's work.....but Buble's career is just beginning and it will be great to see him evolve into a musical force to be reckoned with!  It was also a treat to see him perform on today's DAYS OF OUR LIVES episode (2/17/03)....enjoy!
B00008DDXB|5.0|This movie was awesome! I thought it was so well done. It was almost exactly like the book. Somethings were left out but they weren't major things that ruined the movie. All the actors were great and well chosen. This movie was definately well worth the money and in my opinion I actually think this one was a little better than the first. Bet anyways this movie definately was magical!
0064407667|5.0|After setting the bar high with Harry Potter, we were having a hard time getting our children to focus on other stories.  This one (and the 2 we've covered since then) was a WINNER.  The writing is captivating (even for adults); the stories in this and the subsequent books are imaginative and well-told; the characters are developed well; and Lemony Snicket does a great job of blending suspense, humor and misfortune.  Importantly, the chapters take about 15 minutes to read aloud - perfect for bedtime. (Added on 12/2/04: We are now on book 11 and still going strong.)
B00005YXZH|5.0|I was highly recommended to purchase this Wilco album from a respected music guru friend of mine. Was he on the money! This is now a favorite in the CD player. &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is one hit that you'll find yourself singing over and over again hours after you've listened to it - it just sticks with you. The album over all is very diversified from psychadelic echoe type music (like &quot;I am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;) to jingly catchy tunes (like &quot;I'm the man Who Loves You&quot;). It seems as though Wilco really has tried to change its style with tripping its sound up a bit more - but lead singer Jeff Tweedy still prevails with his distinct voice. People have described Wilco as a country alternative band - maybe in the past, but Yankee Hotel Foxtrot will contrast that opinion. I feel that Wilco will grab more fans with this latest piece of art in the music world. This album is far from boring, but does take an open and educated mind to fully enjoy it. All other Wilco albums are also worth trying. So stop comtemplating and get it!
6305841861|5.0|The Evil Dead II *IS* a remake and a sequel at the same time. In fact, the earliest releases of this on VHS said \\"Evil Dead Too\\" on the cover - as in \\"This is ALSO the Evil Dead\\".<br />While the plot is basic that isn't a factor - I mean *all* plots are simple when you think about it.<br />I once spent a dextromethorphan laced night watching and rewatching this movie for 8 hours straight. It was really cool - as I kept phasing back into and out of the state of consciousness commonly refrred to as \\"reality\\" I felt like I was actually in the movie and since my sense of time was all wacked out, I kept getting weird deja vu feelings as I watched it over and over.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|From the moment I first heard the first song on the album, I was awed by the passion that Lena and Julia have in their singing. They sing from the heart, not worrying about what other might say or think. They sing about their love for each other. A love that just happens to be between two girls. I say, good for you. All that matters is that they love each other and that's all you need. <BR>Not only do they speak from the heart, but they sound awesome too. They can harmonize so well. Their use of trance music mixed with some pop give it an incredible sound, and rhythm. It's by far one of the best albums I have ever heard.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Rarely does a voice come along that is so beautiful, it hurts to listen to it.  Norah Jones has that voice.  I bought the CD based on the one song and love everything on the album.  She's truly an amazing talent and I can't wait to add more of her work to my music collection.

There philosophy is in the idea of sameness. They believe in this so strongly that they have removed memory, emotion, pain, and even color from their society. Jonas is chosen to become the Receiver of Memories. Everyone is so proud and confident in him, but Jonas will soon realize the corrupted community that is being controlled by. Jonas learns about emotion and freedom through an old man known as The Giver. He transfers his memories to Jonas, allowing him to experience love, pain, and joy first hand.<BR>This book is a great and easy read for the science fiction fan inside of us all. If you like the myth or folklore, it will be especially exciting. Every turn of the page hold a new twist that will leave you guessing for more. Although, if your a big fan of solid endings, don't be upset if this book leaves you with unanswered questions. I give this book a very solid 4 out of 5.
B000062YAY|5.0|DOA was my first Slayer album. Two discs for something like 16 bucks I think it was. The first disc is packed with their most &quot;famous&quot; songs. All the songs that you've probably heard if you've heard only a little from Slayer. They rip right through them in great fashion. Tom really doesn't spend a whole lot of time telling the crowd how great their city is. It's mostly song after song with a few exceptions. Disc 2 is full of lesser known tunes but equal in quality. I was amazed at how good, yet real this album was. Even on live albums their is a lot of post production and fixxeruppers. I didn't get that sense with this one. There was even a part on Blood Red where Tom starts the verse too late which I thought was pretty cool. That says to me &quot;We're slayer, this is how we sound live and if you don't like it, we don't care.&quot; After this album I gobbled up all the rest of their stuffed and never looked back.

If you like the myth or folklore, it will be especially exciting. Every turn of the page hold a new twist that will leave you guessing for more. Although, if your a big fan of solid endings, don't be upset if this book leaves you with unanswered questions. I give this book a very solid 4 out of 5.
B000062YAY|5.0|DOA was my first Slayer album. Two discs for something like 16 bucks I think it was. The first disc is packed with their most &quot;famous&quot; songs. All the songs that you've probably heard if you've heard only a little from Slayer. They rip right through them in great fashion. Tom really doesn't spend a whole lot of time telling the crowd how great their city is. It's mostly song after song with a few exceptions. Disc 2 is full of lesser known tunes but equal in quality. I was amazed at how good, yet real this album was. Even on live albums their is a lot of post production and fixxeruppers. I didn't get that sense with this one. There was even a part on Blood Red where Tom starts the verse too late which I thought was pretty cool. That says to me &quot;We're slayer, this is how we sound live and if you don't like it, we don't care.&quot; After this album I gobbled up all the rest of their stuffed and never looked back.
0783114222|5.0|This production represents the most far going attempt yet made to capture the thrill, the glory, the triumph and the courage that was Apollo, while not losing site of the simple humanity of most involved.  It spans the entire programme in a way shows what it was about that space programme that made it special: constant challenges, innovation, novelty and high adventure.  Manned pace exploration in the 60s and 70s was really about the exploration and not exploitation of space!<br />Anyone interested in the Apollo voyages to the moon with find this series a magnificent homage to those trips.  The individual triumph of many of the astronauts is brilliantly captured, the awe, the tenacity, and the spirit of bold curiousity suffuses these programs:  I loved them. The series is perhaps almost as uplifting as the programme itself, and show Apollo for perhaps what it really was: the most inspiring act of faith, courage and singular purpose of the twentieth century.
0783221487|5.0|A beginning is a very delicate time. In 1984, the long awaited film version of Frank Herbert's epic novel Dune came to the silver screen. What happened next? The worst box office disaster in history! Sad to say it, but mostly everyone who saw Dune hated it except for the few who actually read the book! I've always loved this movie but if I ever said that in public I was usually beaten with large rocks or a baseball bat. This review isn't really about the story of the film or it's direction. Its about the confusing truth of their actually being two editions of the 1984 film version of dune.<br />Now here is where the entire true purpose to this review comes in. Many may wonder, \\"why was I watching this on Sci-Fi channel and the director was Alan Smithee instead of David Lynch?\\" Well little Jimmy, the answer is complicated. David Lynch knew when he made Dune he was in trouble and cut the film down incredibly to make it fit the desired time limit. Lynch was slightly pleased with this cut of the film and hoped that that would be the last he would have to do with it... Wrong!<br />A few years when Dune finally was on TV, a special edition version was prepared containing an HOUR of extra footage. A new narration covers the film and practically spells out every bit of information to the audience this time. The studios were ready to show it when suddenly David Lynch says \\"Woa woa, I liked it the way it was!\\" and refuses to have credit for this new longer version. The studio then takes out Lynch's name and replaces it with the fake Alan Smithee who doesn't exist. With me so far?<br />The version of Dune available on DVD and VHS is the David Lynch version which in my opinion actually works better than the longer version. It cuts to the chase and doesn't drag as badly as Smithee's version does.  For those of you who have never seen the Alan Smithee version, its not available to buy but it's shown on the Sci-Fi channel twice a year so there you go!<br />So, even though criticsbombed it, audiences hated it, and David Lynch disowned the longer version, I still love this movie for some mysterious reason! If you're the type who likes weird artistic movies like 12 Monkeys, 2001, or Blade Runner, you will probably enjoy this. Also anime fans, this is right up your alley! For all you other people, get the hell out of here!<br />p.s. Toto's score is a masterpiece! Yea... of all bands... Toto...
B00003XAQ5|5.0|I have numerous copies of this on vinyl including the recent Classic reissue and some 70/80s pressings.  In all cases the vinyl is better than CD, but the SACD matches most of them for space, accuracy and musicality.  For convenience and the purity of the sound, I'm sure the SACD will soon become my regular listener.  It's the best digital version and thorougly satisfying every time.  <br />No comment needed on the performance or recording.  How many other albums do you own more than 3 copies of?
B00005V3Z4|5.0|First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal is an outstanding actor, and I believe this was the first film I ever saw him in. I was totally entranced with the film even before the opening credits finished popping up on the screen. Jake plays Donnie Darko, a young man with a sleeping disorder that has him waking up in strange places (far away from his house, even). Usually, he is drawn out of the house at night by a gigantic bunny - actually, a guy in a bunny costume. Yes, it's really weird. But one night, the vision of the bunny man saves his life, as he is lured out of his bedroom not too long before a big piece of a plane comes crashing down on his bed - where he would have been at the time, if it weren't for his darn strange sleeping habits. This scene sets the stage for what is, I think, one of the strangest movies ever - and the most original.<br />The film also stars Jake's real-life sister Maggie, as Donnie's sister. Patrick Swayze turns in a humorous performance as one of those annoying motivational speakers. Drew Barrymore plays one of his teachers, and Jena Malone is good as Donnie's love interest. And while all of their performances are good, none of them are as good as Jake Gyllenhaal, who gives a haunting, mesmerizing performance that will stick in your mind. If you're going to watch this movie, I suggest doing it on DVD, because I found the audio commentary to be extremely helpful. The reason for this is that there is a lot in this movie I don't really get (the ending, if you ask me, is a weird one, and would love it if someone could please tell me their take on it), and especially the actor commentary was helpful; little things are actually pointed out that could be crucial to understanding the film, or at least it is cool to see how everything sort of all comes together in the end.<br />I don't think this film is for everyone, and a lot of people are going to probably start watching and decide it's too eccentric for them, and not even finish it. But I urge anyone to at least give it a chance, even if it is just for Jake's performance. I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but I can guarantee the film will stay with you for a while.to at least give it a chance, even if it is just for Jake's performance. I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but I can guarantee the film will stay with you for a while.
0064409422|1.0|I didnt like this book much because the story was boring and I dont like fantasy story. Fantasy it is just made up by authors thinking and it doesnt give me any interest. It cant be happening in real world and also it is not even true story, I mean thats why people call fantasy but it is just authors imagination. I cant agree with story because Ive never done before and I know that is not a true. <BR>  This book helped my English study but still I dont like story.  I heard that this book (the lion the witch and the wardrobe) is the first original fantasy series in the world. I feel sorry for C.S Lewis (author) but I dont like this book. This book is not for my age and not my type. This book will appropriate to under 12 years of age. Actually I dont have any idea but one idea came out of my head, which is I think, I dont like this book.

As a child of Disney Fairy Tales.... all so predictable...

B000089CPF|5.0|My wife is a huge Calexico fan, asked this question about six songs into \\"Feast of Wire\\" I said \\"It's Calexico's new one\\"<br />\\"Unbelievable\\" was the reply. In \\"Feast of Wire\\" Calexico still employs plenty of accordian,pedal steel and south of the border trumpets. They also incorporate strings into many of the new tunes which greatly adds to their ever expanding soundtrack in your virtual drive through the badlands. Most of the songs are straight ahead pop or rock, but not to worry their are still plenty of brilliant vignettes of instrumental sounds. What struck me most about \\"Feast of Wire\\" is how Joey Burns so effectively uses his voice to tell his tales of dust, cactus, heat and desert life. I have always really enjoyed how different and magical Calexico's music could be and their uncompromised musical vision and in \\"Feast of Wire\\" Convertino and Burns have taken Calexico more towards the middle of the \\"outside\\" musical spectrum without losing and of the uniqueness. This is a totally<br />accessible album and should be taken with the same reverence as last years \\"Wilco\\" release. I think \\"Feast of Wire\\" is even more enjoyable then \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" in that it has broader soundscapes and musical ideas. Do yourself a favor, forget that pizza this week and go get \\"Feast of Wire\\" and take your virtual journey on a desert trip from Phoenix through El Paso. You can almost feel the sand and heat. Calexico has always been primarily an increible live band whose vision did not always translate on record. With \\"Feast of Wire\\" that has all changed.<br />I stand by my opinion, compared to a release like \\"Aerocalexico\\",<br />\\"Feast of Wire\\" is a pop album. Everyone is entitled to thier opinion and maybe the self congradulatory smugness mentioned would be better pointed to the review that obviously did not listen to \\"Feast of Wire\\" and seems to harbor some sort of personnel agenda about Calexico. I like the band and the album.

B000088E6D|5.0|My wife and I have become great fans of the Romantic standards of the 40's thru 60's. Funny cause we grew up on rock and roll at a time when this was our parents music.  Now we know why they loved it, and Michael Buble nails it with this CD!  Could not believe the depth and quality coming out of the face on that CD. Comparable to a young Sinatra or Harry Connick, Jr. Serious quality production, too.  Great band backing him up, great variety of songs.  For this style of music, Michael Buble has it all.  But what should we expect from the guy who discovered Josh Groban?  A different slice, but similar quality.
B0000797IO|1.0|While this movie is a different direction for Jennifer Aniston, I just could not get into the movie.  By the end, I didn't even care what happened to the characters.  I found the pace slow, the plot was neither funny nor dramatic, and while it was supposed to be set in Texas all of the external scenery was of California.  I just did not see what all of the critics liked about this movie.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|My first instinct was to pass up the album.  The first single was great, but it was hard for me to get past the \\"teenage lesbian\\" hype-up.  I was left asking the question, \\"But can they sing?\\"  The answer:  ABSOLUTELY!!!!  This is one of the most AMAZING album's I've ever heard. With a plethora of meoldies and beats  - from the phenomenol balad \\"30 Minutes\\", to the exotic sounds of \\"Stars\\" with its captivating mix of the English and Russian languages, to the upbeat, sing-songy \\"Malchick Gay\\" that refuses to leave your head - this album has something for everyone.  To quote the hard-hitting \\"Show Me Love,\\" this album leaves the listener \\"screaming for more.\\"  If you liked the single, you will LOVE the album!!

B00006YXEK|5.0|Well what can you say about someone like George and His final offering. It is wonderful.  In my opinion it is only surpassed by all things must pass. Every Track is excellent.  The box set with the pick, poster, sticker, and dvd bonus is worth the money. I bought the CD by itself and the box set with the bonus stuff.  Dhani, and Jeff did an excellent job of finishing it where it feels like George and not them.  Plus if you are a collecter you have to get it!<br />George thanks for a wonderful final album! <br />&quot;All things must pass&quot;<br />Rest in Peace George!
B00005JLSC|3.0|Adapted from the successfully revived hit musical that has been doing the rounds on Broadway and London's West End, Chicago is the cinematic directorial debut of stage director and choreographer Rob Marshall. Chicago is on the whole a dark affair, akin somewhat to both Cabaret and Bugsy Malone. It stars Renee Zellwegger as the `heroine' Roxie Hart, who shoots her no good lover dead when he decides to dump her. Arrested and sent to jail she meets up with fellow killer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones), a former nightclub chanteusse that gunned down both her husband and sister after catching them in a romantic clinch. Velma, initially has no interest in poor old naive Roxie because due to her celebrity lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and the prison warder (Queen Latifah) she's a bigger celebrity in prison than she ever was out of prison. That is until Roxie starts to steal her thunder.<br />Hollywood has a long established tradition of making musical movies, indeed the first Oscars best picture winner of the sound era, in 1929, was The Broadway Melody. Until the 1970's when musicals became strangely unfashionable musicals continued to pick up those famous golden statuettes regularly, with the likes of Gigi, West Side Story, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music picking up Best Picture Oscars between 1959 and 1965. It wasn't until 2001's Moulin Rouge that the musical was resurrected and readopted as a viable and popular movie genre. Chicago has been nominated for a whopping 13 Oscars with at least one nomination in every major category, with the exception of Best Actor. It also won three major Golden Globe Awards, Best Picture and Best Actor and Actress in a musical or comedy for its stars, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger.<br /> With all the Golden Globes and Oscar hype you might expect that the movie adaptation of Chicago would be something special. However, enjoyable as Chicago undoubtedly is, it is certainly not in the league of any of the previously mentioned screen musicals. Don't get me wrong, Chicago is a good movie, an enjoyable movie and an entertaining movie. It boasts some decent performances too, particularly from the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones and the formidable presence that is Queen Latifah. Richard Gere has some nice moments too and is appropriately slick as lawyer Billy Flynn, manipulating the media and tap dancing his way out of many a tight spot. He has one of the best numbers in the whole show (Razzle Dazzle) and with his background of stage musicals, earlier in his career, was perfectly cast. John C. Reilly nominated in this years Oscars for best supporting actor is both appropriately sad and gullible in equal measures, as Roxie's poor sap of a husband, Amos. ReneeZellweger's performance is also good but not a patch on her turns in Nurse Betty, Bridget Jones's Diary, or Jerry Maguire. Undoubtedly she gives a good performance and is a likeable heroine but next to the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones her lack of a musical background is evident.<br />Chicago is a very difficult show to open out cinematically, with much of the action being set in a prison.  Nearly all of the scenes in Chicago betray its stage origins with little expansion of the action out-with a traditional theatrical format. Even with the device of cutting between the reality and the musical fantasies in Roxie's head, Chicago looks like it was all filmed on a sound stage, which of course it was. It therefore seems strangely unbelievable that Rob Marshall has been nominated as Best Director in this years Academy awards when Baz Luhrmann was excluded from last years nominations. Love it or loathe it Moulin Rouge was surely a far more original, innovative and technically more impressive film than the rather formulaic staginess of Chicago. However, what the movie lacks in innovation it makes up for with its classic musical numbers, such as `All That Jazz', `Mr Cellophane' and the previously mentioned `Razzle Dazzle'.<br />In summary, if you are afan of stage musicals and cant afford to get to Broadway or London's West End then this is certainly worth the price of a movie ticket and far cheaper too. It boasts a great cast that you'll certainly never see on stage together but you'll miss out on that unique live experience. The choice is yours and in the words of Amos Hart `thanks for listening'.e a fan of stage musicals and cant afford to get to Broadway or London's West End then this is certainly worth the price of a movie ticket and far cheaper too.

0064409422|3.0|When I firs read this book I didn't like it because is like a little boy's book. After the second chapter I started to get more into it, for the first time in my life I enjoy reading more than ever. <BR>What the author does in this book is that he repeats some phrases many times, and that's why I thought it is a kids book. But this is the kind of books that repeats phrases so you can remember it like I'm doing now.<BR>He describes everything really well, and clear so you can imagine it as he wants you to imagine it.<br />This book is about 4 young English boys that are send to another place because of the war, they were send to the professor house.

Narnia is the name of this world, and there is a witch that control everything so it is always winter but never Christmas.<BR>There is a lion called Aslan, he is coming to save Narnia.

B000002UAX|5.0|Man, what else could be said about the white album. These two cds are just phenomenal. There isn't one bad song, everything is great.
B000069HKH|5.0|This isn't the happiest of albums, and if you actually listen to the words it's even a little bit depressing. But the music and tone are so beautiful, Bruce Springsteen is amazing, and lately this has been all I've been listening to - nothing seems to compare. It's great for singing along as well.<br />\\"Into the Fire,\\" \\"Empty Sky,\\" and \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" are my absolute favorites. \\"Into the Fire\\" is sentimental and touching. \\"Empty Sky\\" just does something for me, conjures up images of snow covered fields and gray skies. \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" is probably the most upbeat song of the whole album. All the songs are catchy, and this isn't one of those albums where by the end you're sick to death of the artist's voice.
B00005JLRR|1.0|Such a pity that the occasionally great STAR TREK series of movies had to peter out with this pedestrian offering. A contrived plot with few credible links to earlier TREKS, a cast that looked like it desperately wanted to be somewhere - anywhere - else and a villain who only lacked a mustache to twirl to be the cliche movie bad guy (though wotizname's performance in the role was actually a highlight among lotsa lowlights). <br />Once upon a time STAR TREK (i) had ethical values it adhered to; (ii) had production values (iii) was either moving or funny depending on the mood of the movie or (iv) was sometimes all of the above. The aptly named NEMESIS, however, lacks values of either kind and is about as funny as a dead fish.<br />One possible plus: notwithstanding the claims that this is definitely the last TREK movie, there were plenty of opportunities for another, which would just about have to be an improvement. Even killing Data needn't be permanent since B4 (admittedly presently about as smart as B1 and B2, the Bananas in Pyjamas) can obviously be given a bit more RAM and a faster CPU and seeing as how he's conveniently got Data's memories, we can have Data back. (But memo make-up: Brent Spiner is aging fast).
B00005YW4H|3.0|I bought this album expecting a rock-fest in the tradition of Molly Hatchet.  What a surprise I got!  Instead of the hard-charging southern rock I thought I was getting, my ears were treated to the sound of a rare and lovely songbird ... a songbird known as Norah Jones.  The best cuts here ring with emotional truth and subtle musical experimentation.  But if you're looking for loud, southern-fried boogie, better to stick with Hatchet or ZZ Top.
0060537639|5.0|So much for Captain Cook and all that. This book laughs in the face of everything I was taught in history at school. It was a complete eye-opener for me and I think this a great book for anyone who is right into Chinese history like I am. Mr Menzies presents a very convincing argument backed up with evidence from all over the world and from all different authorities on a variety of subjects. Totally immersing read.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Some folks seem to love this album, but everyone else should know it's really very, very strange.  First of all, Wilco doesn't sound anything like they used to.  It's like they left behind their guitars and now just go around shaking Christmas bells.  And everyone and everything sounds really sad.  Why are they so depressed?  They have hundreds of dollars and live in beautiful duplexes and drive cool cars!  Lighten up!  <br />If I saw Wilco hanging out, I'd say, &quot;Wilco, you should go back to making serious but upbeat music that people will really like instead of thinking they have to like because it's weird and somehow seems really important.  You are not the second coming of Bob Dylan, J.D. Salinger, Alan Alda, Gram Parsons and Jutes LaBone all rolled into one!!  Go have some potato chips with Ron Wood and come back when you're ready to make a record that gets people dancing instead of just getting on lots of critics' lists!&quot;  Then I would leave and go listen to an earlier, better album like &quot;AM&quot; or maybe even the Stones' &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; or Goldie Locks Callahan.

B00006690G|3.0|On this album, the so-called \\"Detroit Demolisher\\" moves away from his trademark sound toward a musical style known as 'rap.'  It's an odd choice for someone like Em, but it often works.  What's really amazing though is the emotional openness of the album.  Eminem shows us the sad, terrified, crying little boy inside himself.  He is afraid of the world and wants to be protected, even loved for who he really is.  In this way, Em follows the sensibility of other \\"open-hearted\\" artists like Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli.

0156711427|4.0|Whether you visit another country the intent is often to \\"see\\" the place.  But how does one go about it?  What can you learn of place from the geographic features or urban landmarks and settings?  What can you learn from talking with the locals?  Can you ever really understand them?  <br />These are some of the questions that Forster uses to shape the message of his novel. Some of the English in \\"A Passage to India\\" seem to feel that they can get a feel for India by physically experiencing some of the geography.  Others believe that it is possble by meeting and talking with the Indians.  Yet either approach is stymied one way or another - India is vast in its geography, cultures, languages and religions.  \\"A Passage to India\\" asks readers what are the barriers to and limitations of to comprehension and even friendship between peoples in an environment of unequality  under colonialism and diverse cultures?<br />\\"A Passage to India\\" is Forster's parable of race and identity and the locale of India, as a crossroads of cultures, provides a remarkable apt setting for getting his points across. The plot is slim but detailed, the timeframe in which the events occur is specific, making the pace of the novel relatively easy to follow,read and analyze.  There are a handul of characters in the novel, which allows Forster to more fully develop them.  In their dialogue many of the themes that Forster explores and points of view that he relates - the colonial English and their Indian subjects - come out in complex, rich detail.<br />Moreover, since the novel is set in India on the verge of its independence, other questions present additional complexities. How do countries with various, strong ethnic and cultural identifies form a single nation? This theme emerges as Forster delves into dialogues between the indigenous characters who all share superstitions, fears and misgivings about one another based on ethnicity, culture and religion but above all share a strong, common loathing of the British. Is a distrust and dislike for \\"the other,\\" the \\"outsider\\" strong enough to build a national identity? Read \\"A Passage to India\\" and think through this question and others.  These questions are relevant to today's societies as they were to the India Question in Forster's age.
0790729725|5.0|wow this was a great movie.....nicely directed...awesome mob movie..........joe pesci and ray liotta play very nicely in this movie.....as usual robert dinero delivers a great performance... this awesome movie made it in my dvd collection.....
B00007L4MJ|4.0|Per a lengthy review at DVD Talk, this DVD is at 24 fps because that apparently is how the movie was originally shown in the 1920s -- sometimes at 25 or 26 fps, likely because the movie was so long that the distributors feared they'd lose people, so they sped up the film to shorten the viewing time. The original score was made to go with the movie at 24 fps. So, this IS the original Metropolis -- at least as far as the first theatergoers saw it. But, as the DVD Talk reviewer notes, the movie definitely should be viewed at 20 fps. But this is the best we have for now, until someone spends the $$ to rescore it and re-DVD it at 20 fps. Any volunteers?

B00003CXXM|4.0|What could put people off from seeing this movie is (1)It is a \\"remake\\" of a TV movie. (2)The story begins with trained assassin who lost his memory. (3)It has Matt Damon (4)It is PG-13, so perhaps it's not violent enough.<br />But what made \\"The Bourne Identity\\" so good is exactly the above, with the addition of stunning visual, fast-paced story, and Franka Potente.<br />Even though we are exposed to many of the premise with a guy (or woman) who wakes up and can't remember who he or she is, but realize that he or she possesses superhuman abilities, hence go on a journey to find out what happened. \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is not so different, but without wasting too much time on the actualy \\"search\\", troubles come one after another for the hero. In another word, nothing in the 118 minutes feel redundant (with the exception of the love scene).<br />The dialogues are clever, the action is slick without going over the top. Every actors delivered an adequate job for the characters they are given. And one big surprise for Matt Damon who normally comes accross as the whiney wimpy guy is actually believable as an ex-assassin.<br />The DVD is a neat package itself. The picture is top-notch, and the thunderous soundtrack (especially DTS) is house shattering. However the extras are a bit of disappointment, there is an \\"...-kissing\\" making-of, a few interesting deleted scenes plus a \\"stickier\\" alternative ending, cast bio and production notes. Compare to some \\"collector's Edition\\" that came out recently, this one does appear to be thin.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Without venturing into the debate as to whether this is the greatest film of all time (which is of course a matter of personal taste -- what is undeniable is that the film has enormous historical importance), I would like to advise prospective buyers that this 2-DVD package is an excellent buy.  The print, as other reviewers have noted, is remarkably crisp and clear -- this release is comparable to some of the better Criterion releases.  Also, I found the commentaries to be quite interesting.  Robert Ebert's commentary was as good as any I have seen, to my considerable surprise.  The included documentary is also quite good.  The other special features were well-executed if somewhat superfluous.<br />If you are going to purchase this film, to my knowledge this is the best available release and I highly recommend it.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This movie was made in 35 days and wow what an awesome movie......this is an awesome performance by kevin spacey, who gives his best performance to date....over powers his performance in American Beauty.....The dialogue is nicely put and everything comes together nicely....This movie will keep you wondering utill the end....and i can garantee you will watch it more than once if you do see it the first time..... this is one of the best movies ever made.....this movie should  be in your DVD collection.....just great....very suspenseful
B000002HH2|5.0|I am so sorry that I didn't buy this album a long time agao. This album is WONDERFUL! Every single track on this CD is top-quality--absolutely no throw-away songs. They all flow together, one to the next. I cannot begin to describe this album so you're just going to have to get it yourself and see! it's soooooooo worth it.
B000003T9B|5.0|no rocker has any doubt about this record. this and TAKING OVER ARE metal more than fort knox (or manowar could dream of). if you want to own a big heavy metal collection buy this two and throw away the rest(especially manowar).
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I think this is one of those albums that can change a person's life, if you allow it. Although most songs are not his own, Cash makes them his own through careful, deliberate renditions coming straight from his gut and heart. You are with him the whole way even though it hurts sometimes, but you take it anyway.<br />It sounds like the Man in Black is dying on this record, and that this is farewell. Each song has either goodbyes, death, or the apcolypse as its main subject. Sounds too depressing? Well, it is depressing but it can also be uplifting, in that coming-to-terms-with-mortality way. <br />I can't say enough about this album. I even dare to call it a masterpiece of folk/country music. A must-buy.
B000068TPN|5.0|When I saw this movie it was awesome. It starts out with a platoon of french that get massacred and then for an hour it shows the troops training and then the rest is awesome especially the end which i wont tell what happens. The hour of training may sound boring but it has great commedie like the sergent major making smart remarks.

This book ranks up there with his masterpiece &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot;.  Any fan of his work, or readers looking for a in depth, great novel should read &quot;Prey&quot;.

B000068TPN|5.0|I went to see this movie in the wake of Sep 11, when I was still terrified my active-duty husband would be sent overseas to fight.  Watching this film left me in tears, it was so profoundly powerful in its telling of the tale.  I can't describe it better than that -- profound.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I really like this cd! I think I was expecting a little more after falling in love with their album Make Yourself though. If you loved Make Yourself then youll like this one too. Dont expect the same but definitely worth adding to your collection. &quot;Warning&quot; would have to be my favorite song because it reminds me of Make Yourself. Incubus is a group you have to listen to over again to really enjoy their music though. I do recommend paying the money,.....Incubus is great!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I missed this film in its theatrical release (apparently it received limited distribution), but since it requires at least two viewings, it's well-suited for DVD.  It's difficult to describe the story or even characterize it by genre, which shows how original the film is.  Simply put, it's about time travel, but it's about a lot more than that, too.  <br />The acting is consistently outstanding, with a list of well-known names in the cast, along with less familiar ones.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance that is so convincing, you forget that he is acting;  he IS Donnie Darko. While the story is mainly told through his eyes, the other characters are surprisingly sympathetic as well.  This is not an easy feat for a script to accomplish, especially when the viewer must focus so much attention on every event. It would have been easy to create a one-dimensional hero and a bunch of villains, but writer/director Richard Kelly doesn't take the easy way out.  <br />Instead, we get a highly intelligent and challenging film that engages us as much as it baffles us, that injects enough humor to keep us from stress-overload, and most importantly, makes us want to watch it again and again, even after we know what's going on.  In this sense, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; succeeds where other films have fallen short:  for example, I enjoyed the complexities of &quot;Memento&quot;, but I was not able to identify or even care very much about any of the characters.  The same was true of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.  Both are excellent films, but I viewed both from a distance, more analytically than emotionally.  <br />I did not view &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; from a distance.  I was drawn into the world that it creates, and enjoyed it enough to return more than once.  A brilliant first film from Richard Kelly, who has set a very high standard for himself.<br />The DVD does full justice to this fine movie.  The video and audio are excellent, and the extra features are quite thorough.  I particularly enjoyed the commentary by Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, which I listened to the second time I watched the film.  They do a great job of helping the viewer to connect the dots.  They also include just enough of the usual &quot;behind the scenes&quot; banter to keep the commentary from becoming too academic.  <br />This DVD would definitely be included in any &quot;desert island&quot; list that I would ever compile. Strongly recommended!
0440224764|2.0|John Grisham knows how to write a mystery. His books _The Client_, _The Runaway Jury_, and _The Street Lawyer_ demonstrate a skill of plot, particularly, throughout his career. His work is a shrine to &quot;Show, don't tell.&quot;<br />_The Partner_ is an exception. Nearly every detail of the plot is revealed through monologues, the intrigue occuring after the fact. On the upshot, this would translate into a drama with a comfortably low budget and demanding memorization for the actors.
B00006LLNU|5.0|() is almost like the nautral progression from Agaetis Byrjun. The album begins with the slowburning Track 1 which is eventually lifted to heights again by the same haunting vocals that graced Sigur Ros' albums. The mood then alternates between darker and uplifting from Track 2 onwards thus serving up a mixture of spooky and ambient music.<br /><br />Though the album seems to be lacking a theme, each untitled track embodies a completely different flavor and evokes a strange yet familiar feeling to the listener. Sigur Ros has once again managed to create a masterpiece with great theatricity!
B00005J6UP|5.0|The first thing I was thinking when \\"Goonies\\" really kicked into gear was: This is the daydream of an adventure-loving preadolescent boy, full of pirates, bloodthirsty villains, and exotic twists and turns in an underground maze full of booby traps. It's sort of \\"Indiana Jones\\" for the kids as well as the adults.<br />The Goonies (a band of young boys) are spending their last weekend hanging around their hometown, before it's razed for yuppie developers. Then Mikey Walsh (Sean Astin) uncovers a treasure map hidden in an old painting, and becomes obsessed with finding the lost treasure of the pirate One-Eyed Willie. With that treasure, they could save their town.<br />But the hunt for treasure sends the Goonies, Mikey's long-suffering teenage brother (Josh Brolin), and a pair of teenage girls (Kerri Green and Martha Plimpton) into dangerous proximity to the murderous fugitives, the Fratellis. With the Fratellis on their tail, the Goonies are determinedly navigating the underground, booby-trap-infested tunnels that lead to the treasure -- or to a very nasty demise.<br />The stolidly mature among you may scoff at the improbability of the story, but who cares? This is obviously a fantasy story, harkening back to pirate treasure and childhood adventures, thwarting the evil guys. The classic formulae are what makes it so fun. \\"Goonies\\" is like \\"Indiana Jones\\" in the sense that it's action-filled, with nasty villains, elaborate booby-traps, and a plotline that is wonderfully improbable. This is just fun. The sets are amazingly complex, full of stone tunnels and enormous waterfalls full of money, thin little bridges and a bone piano that causes the floor to collapse.<br />Sean Astin (yes, this is THAT Sean Astin, the guy currently starring as Samwise Gamgee in \\"Lord of the Rings\\") is endearing and very convincing as Mikey, the gutsy boy that could. Josh Brolin is also good as his overbearing but nice brother; the other Goonies include the incredibly funny Corey Feldman as \\"Mouth\\" (the scene where he weirds out the cleaning lady is priceless), comic relief Jeff Cohen as \\"Chunk\\" who bumbles from one misadventure to another, and Jonathan Ke Quan (who was also in \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\") as gadget-obsessed \\"Data,\\" a kid riddled all over with homemade inventions that occasionally save the heroes' behinds.<br />Though this film was made in the 1980s, it's aged extremely well -- now there is affection on top of the original liking for it. It's a funny, entertaining thrillride with pirates, villains, treasure and a band of quirky heroes. Great fun.\\"Mouth\\" (the scene where he weirds out the cleaning lady is priceless), comic relief Jeff Cohen as \\"Chunk\\" who bumbles from one misadventure to another, and Jonathan Ke Quan (who was also in \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\") as gadget-obsessed \\"Data,\\" a kid riddled all over with homemade inventions that occasionally save the heroes' behinds.<br />Though this film was made in the 1980s, it's aged extremely well -- now there is affection on top of the original liking for it.

0375704027|4.0|I found that this book was hard to get into at first. I read about a chapter and a half and needed a break. Once I picked it up again, I was hooked.<br />Although on the surface this novel appears to be a simple coming of age tale, it goes much deeper than that. I found myself getting caught up in the creative way that Murakami uses setting to create tone and atmosphere in the story. The things going on in the background - the campus riots, dorm life, the sanitarium, etc., aren't just there to fill up space. They're integral to creating the mood the author needs to get across his themes. And his themes are very complex - issues to do with the nature of love, life, and loss in modern society. This is a very disturbing book, with some imagery (the sex scenes aren't thrown in here just to be titillating. In fact, the sex is some of the most disturbing I've read in serious fiction in a long time. But that's part of the point - he's showing how sex can actually be a means of creating distance rather closeness between people) although there is an element of hope in the end.<br />I didn't like the use of the flashback technique in this book. The novel starts with Toru, the main character, as an adult reflecting back on his life at age 20ish. Other authors (notably Wolff in Patterns of Childhood) have used memory as a device to better effect than Murakami did here. He could just as easily have started the novel with Toru at 19 and skipped the first chapter. The book doesn't particularly deal well with mental illness or suicide, in that I didn't particularly gain a whole lot more insight into either of those two issues than I had prior to reading the book.<br />Having said that, the reason this book is so gripping and kept me reading to the end is that Murakami created characters I could invest in and relate to.  I cared about these people, and I wanted to know what happened to them. Naoko wasn't quite as fully fleshed out as Toru, or even Midori, but I think that fit; so much of she was was an image in Toru's mind. This novel is one where the use of the first person narrative was an brilliant choice on behalf of the author. It's vital to the story that everything is told from Toru's point of view. The dialogue is very good, too.<br />I can't compare this novel to any of the author's other work, as I haven't read any of it. I don't expect to rush out and read his other books, given how different they are purported to be compared to Norwegian Wood. I will say that if you are looking for a coming of age novel that still has appeal to those over the age of 25, this book is a good choice.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters Inc. has one of the the most delicious storylines that Disney has dared to dream up in a while. The monsters' job in this flick is to scare children, but not for the reasons you may think. They collect the screams of children and turn them into much needed energy for Monstropolis. These monsters are terribly frighteningand collect many screams but in all actuality are terribly frightened of the children themselves. The fun starts when one child wanders through her closet and plops into the world of the monsters. John Goodman, the best scarer also has the biggest heart and wants to get her back home before the monsters know she's there and destroy her. Aided by his best friend they begin their journey on the run and eventually grow fond of the girl who they ironically nickname.... Boo! A few unexpected twists takes you to the very predictable ending as all ends well and with a few tears from me as well. What can I say....I still cry at The Lion King. A fun flick that your kids are sure to love and who can protest any movie that will help them NOT be afraid of the monsters in their closet.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Sir George Solti is one of the most recorded conductors. He made the famous Chicago Symphony Orchestra a household name in classical music. He is a unique artist, ambitious, driven, perfectionist, sensible, stylish and full of fire. George Solti is clearly comfortable conducting music of the 19th century Romantic Era. Time and again he has proven his might in such music as Wagner operas and Beethoven symphonies, chamber music, overtures and piano concerti. Johannes Brahms was a prolific and outstanding composer in the late nineteenth century, considered by many to be the worthy successor to Beethoven himself. Brahms combined the inspirational, emotionally sensitive and dramatic music of the new Romantic movement with the balanced perfection and structure of the Classical movement. While the leading composers Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner dedicated themselves to \\"music of the future\\", Brahms glorified the music of the past.<br />Sir George Solti becomes Johannes Brahms himself when he conducts the four symphonies which marked his career. The first symphony is orchestrated with fresh interpretation, elegant, spirited and full of human warmth and emotion. The last movement of Brahm's first symphony, which had mixed reviews at its premiere, was compared to the Ode to Joy theme. Brahms did not deny this, saying, \\"Any idiot can see that.\\" Brahms evidently lifted the theme and made a variation. He did not hide the fact that Beethoven was his real inspiration and he praised him in a symphony that, to this day, is still regarded as Beethoven's 10th .<BR>The second and third symphonies are exact, precise, well orchestrated in the hands of the Chicago Symphony and George Solti pulls through with magnetism, subtle elegance and attention to detail, full of the romantic flavor that Brahms is most loved for. The classical structure, perfect balance and poise, color in every individual instrument, is each a component of the masterful symphonies of Brahms. The fourth symphony, although still in lines with the same style, is perhaps more romantic than its preceding symphonies. The Fourth opens with a haunting, romantic theme, a lyric string section which seems to despair with the drama and tragic context of the full orchestra. The fourth is undoubtedly Brahms' finest symphony, as it is his last and ultimately his lasting mark in the musical world. <br />The Tragic and Academic Festival Overtures come with this box set. The Tragic Overture, hence its name, is full of the pathos of an unexplainable tragedy, human in emotion and dark in scope. Only Brahms could spin out such intensely despairing melodies, making it a trademark of the romantic movement. The Academic Festival is lighter, more spirited and joyous. It was composed as Brahms was being honored with a degree in music at a German university. In the 19th century, institutions of education in Germany were the finest in the world, equal to Oxford in England and the East Coast Ivy League schools in America. The Academic Festival Overture begins with variations on student's songs which Brahms had heard on campus, with \\"Janissary\\" flavor, Turkish instruments such as timpani and cymbals, long held as festive from the standards of Mozart days. The last theme is a declaration of joy and praise to wisdom. For those who like to pinpoint certain things, the Academic Festival Overture is used in movie and commercials when they show a college campus. It was the \\"Acme University\\" theme in the old cartoon series, \\"Tiny Toons.\\" Sir George Solti is the best interpretor of Brahms symphonies and overtures. He has substance, he has style and surpasses even those of Karajan conducting.
0151008116|5.0|In its first step from the UK to the Commonwealth, the Booker Prize continues to identify books that do not disappoint.  In Life of Pi, Yann Martel has written a book of incredible beauty.<br />Unlike many highly praised books which rely on cleverness and complexity, the bulk of the story is a simple one.  A zookeeper's son and a handful of animals are the only survivors when their ship goes down in the Pacific.  In a matter of days, only the boy and a tiger are left.  We then get to see how the boy and tiger survive the better part of a year together on a lifeboat before they finally come aground in Mexico.  And yet, within this simple story is great depth of character and feeling.<br />To be honest, I found Part One of this novel to be the most interesting.  The world of the zoo in India, Pi's growth and participation in all three of the &quot;religions of Abraham,&quot; as well as the quirks of his family and friends makes for wonderful reading.  Once the shipwreck happens and the story turns to the survival of boy and tiger in Part Two, I thought the book lost a little.  The story continues to be a very honest and believable one with many interesting tidbits, but this kind of survival is ground that's been tread before though, admittedly, not often as well.  And despite the fact that Part Three brings the novel to a nice close, it doesn't have the fire of the beginning of the novel.<br />Ultimately, however, this book stands head and shoulders over most of what's published today.  Martel writes absolutely beautiful prose.  There are some wonderful, quotable turns of phrase in this novel which is a rare occurrence in most modern writers.  Pi is a deeply developed and sympathetic character.  And the story comes across as perfectly believable despite the strangeness of some of the events.  Martel's tone is one of incredible honesty.  This is a book not to be missed.
B00005JLXC|1.0|I went to see Daredevil, hoping that it would capture and repeat some of the magic of last year's Spider-Man. However, instead of getting Spider-Man one and a half, this movie is more like a fractional Spider-Man, one-half. The movie suffers from fitful direction and an absolute lack of pacing.  It's enough to make one wonder if it is simply the result of poor editing or if for lack of time there was not enough suitable material to make a complete film. It could be both.  Unfortunately, all I know is Daredevil fails to make a meaningful whole out of the sum of its many, promising parts. Eager to make a quick buck, it seems the studio pushed an unfinished script into production to capitalize on the last couple of years' successful comic book adaptations. Don't let that ill-gained dollar be yours.<br />What is truly unfortunate is that the concept is not devoid of potential. But the story is unfinished and the resulting performances show it. Mark Steven Johnson's participation as both a screenwriter and the director, means that a great part of the blame could be attributable to him.  Despite his reported passion for the material, and with the exception of the scenes covering the origins of Daredevil, there is almost no attempt made to make any emotional connection to the characters whatsoever.  Notable actors such as Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner and Michael Clarke Duncan are all ill-used in this charade.  From their delivery of the clich&eacute;d dialogue, it doesn't even sound like the actors in this film know what they are supposed to be doing.  With the Daredevil material having been around for so long, and with any number of potential story lines, it seems the director simply failed in successfully choosing a concept and fleshing it out as a complete story for the audience.  So what we are left with is a group of shallow characters, poorly shot fight scenes, and perhaps the the laziest film adaptation possible from such an existing, richly imagined world.<br />This is not to say that the movie is without its moments. The special effects are decent, if derivative, but not up to the standards of similar films in the same genre.  Fortunately the world of Daredevil is a dark one and so the audience doesn't get much of a chance to see the visual shortcomings.  I imagine most of the effects shots won't stand up so well under DVD-viewing scrutiny.  Jon Favreau and Joe \\"Joey Pants\\" Pantoliano both do a great job.  But the best moments in the film are reserved for the entirely over the top performance of Colin Farrell as the villainous Bullseye. But even he is not enough to salvage this misbegotten project from the over-abundance of unimaginative, uninspired dialogue.  Which brings me to a word of warning. Daredevil is a violent film and I would not suggest it for small children. The brand of vigilantism that the protagonist practices results in a body count only exceeded in violence by the villains.<br />Ultimately, there is nothing so obvious here as the fact that a better script and director could not have made this a much better film. But Johnson seems at a loss as director to control the action whether shooting the typical fight sequences or the typical on-screen romance between Garner's Elektra and Affleck's Murdock.  Even the soundtrack fails to make this film a more meaningful, cohesive whole. Never, besides 'The Phantom Menace', have I left a movie feeling so unfulfilled.  What escapes my comprehension is how Spider-Man was done so right when the conceptually similar Daredevil went so terribly wrong.  I rarely write reviews, but I feel I would be doing the general public a disservice if I did not express the lack of craftsmanship represented by this film.  I'm sure this film will do well at the box-office.  I even suspect there will be a sequel in the works, but as it stands, Daredevil leaves the viewer seeing the characters just like they would appear in their source material comic books: flat, two-dimensional, and derivedfrom wood.ood.
B000084T18|5.0|This album is one of the best rap albums in the last 3 years, I'd put it in my top 10 from 2000 to now.  I thought at first that the only songs I'd really like would be &quot;In Da Club&quot; and &quot;Wanksta&quot; but I find myself listening to other songs in this very fine album.  Songs like &quot;What Up Gangsta&quot;, &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot; (nice bit in the middle with Em), &quot;Many Men&quot;, &quot;If I Can't&quot;, &quot;Back Down&quot;, and &quot;21 Questions&quot; carry most of the weight of the album along with the 2 radio songs.  There's about 2-3 songs out of 19 that I don't particularly care for but that's remarkable considering the amount of sub par rap albums there are nowadays (you reading this Jay-Z &amp; Ja Rule?).  It's nice to know that the likes of 50, Nas and Em still believe in making good albums instead of two or three good radio singles and terrible albums like the ones I mentioned in parentheses.
0553801511|5.0|Slipping into this book was like slipping into a comfortable old coat. It was wonderful and the character development was wonderful, but the angst (I got the word from above) reminds me of Stephan Donaldson's leprosy-ridden hero. Why does FitzCalvary have to suffer internally so much? Bring Nettle and Molly and Burris to Buckkeep and a lot more could happen. Get the prince and FC to wit to a new beast - and see what happens.  But of course, I am sure Robin Hobb will keep us going - but can she do it in another 800 pages - maybe she will need 24000.  At any rate this trilogy is even more exciting that the first, and easier to take and more interesting, without the leap of faith of the hero in the wolf. The only thing is it cannot stand alone. I cannot wait for the final one - Help!

Richie Havens, Paul Simon, James Taylor, Bob Dylan and Neal Young were just working on the prototypes for him.<br />But other people are allowed to play Dave's invention.  And they can do so without being compared to the 6-string love god himself.  If you only like DMB, then good for you.  But don't bother writing reviews of other artists...just run off and give 5 star ratings to all the DMB stuff, and then lock yourself in a darkened room in case you hear something new.<br />Mayer's offering is a little immature, and a bit boring, but it shows promise.  He is a better guitarist than he lets on here.  Hopefully his next work will have some more body.  And sound a bit more or less like DMB.  Who cares which!
B00006RU5B|4.0|If you're a Soundgarden and/or Rage Against the Machine fan and have only heard the song, \\"Cochise,\\" trust in the notion that you've only seen the tip of the iceberg.  In my opinion, the initial single is one of the weaker tracks of this offering, though it is an effective usher to the rest of the album. It doesn't take long to be rewarded for your continued attention, however.  The second track grabs you from the outset with its inviting metallic riffs and you quickly come to understand why Chris Cornell (former lead singer of Soundgarden) couldn't be satisfied with half a career as he bellows out to the Creator, \\"You gave me life, Now Show Me How to Live\\".<br />\\"Like a Stone,\\" the fourth song on Audioslave's debut, is currently gaining momentum and airplay across the country, reviving that Soundgardeness that many of us have been lamenting the loss of for years now.  Though the album is certainly more \\"Garden\\" than \\"Machine,\\" Rage fans take heart.  Tom Morello (former guitarist of Rage Against the Machine) continues to excavate intonations that, although not complex, continue to defy the mainstream.  Don't miss his far-too-short interlude in, \\"Shadow on the Sun,\\" which I can only hope matures into a full-blown solo on tour.  And while I'm at it, if you're going to listen to only one song on the album, go for, \\"Bring `em Back Alive,\\" which is the most original piece I've heard from either of the foregoing bands since, \\"4th of July\\" (Superunkown).  Other notables include, \\"Gasoline\\", \\"Hypnotize\\", \\"Getaway Car\\" and, \\"the Last Remaining Light\\".<br />On the other side of the coin, I found that, \\"Set it Off,\\" felt all too forced, as though it was halfheartedly included to please rebellious Rage fans and ultimately doesn't convince the listener.  I'd also complain that, individually, most of the songs don't measure up instrumentally to some of the greats of the members' preceding groups, lacking depth of expression with overly simplistic solos and too many unexplored avenues.  But that is a tall task and all-in-all, the album stacks up well with just about any of either of the fore-bearing groups' productions, conferring unto itself a solid replay threshold.<br />If you're seeking a reproduction of the raw insurgence of Rage Against the Machine, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a substantial collection of mixed melodies and inventive conceptions overlaid by the most talented frontman of his generation, pick up the self-titled, \\"Audioslave\\".
0553801511|5.0|I don't think I've read a character as frustrating and endearing as Fitz.  Robin Hobb does an excellent job developing interesting,and human (if not always completely realistic) characters.  Usually with a main character who makes decisions as poorly as Fitz, I can't enjoy the book, and in fact, that tainted my enjoyment of the Farseer trilogy.  It seems that either I've gotten used to it, or Ms. Hobb has done a better job walking that tightrope, because I've greatly enjoyed the Tawny Man series thus far.
B000077VPU|3.0|This review is a rehash of most of the other reviews, but I'll echo the general sentiments:  this is one of the best benefit-type concerts ever staged, incredible sound quality, great visuals, fine musicianship, and the like.  If you're a big Queen fan it's a must-have DVD.  But there's no question the &quot;double DVD&quot; labeling gives you the impression it's the whole concert unabridged, which it isn't -- it's only the last half of the concert with the surviving Queen members.  Omitted where mostly three-songs sets by Def Leppard, Metallica, Extreme and GnR.  And these were tremendous sets.  A real shame they didn't include them on the second DVD.  I hope Bryan May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon fix this.
B00004Y2FT|4.0|I can't say I know enough about The Cocteau Twins to go into their history, or point out what's missing, so I wont. I will say this though. It's roughly the best of their 80's material, 18 tracks, all remastered, and every song more beautiful than the last. What's not to love? Perfect for one who just wants the best of this group on one album. If your tired of radio and whatever the current fads are of the time, put this in and enjoy. It's magical and timeless. And though you don't always know what she's singing about, I think it adds to it all, keeps your imagination going. This may appeal to fans of the shoegaze scene, or even Enya. Enjoy.
B0000640VO|5.0|&quot;On Sept. 3, 1973 a blue fly capable of flapping 70 beats a minute landed on St. Vincent Street in Montmartre...&quot;<BR>   I have been a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet since &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, but when I first received wind of &quot;Amelie&quot; I had no idea that it was Jeunet's work until I finally rented it.  &quot;Amelie&quot; is by far his greatest, most beautiful, and least fantastic masterpiece.  Wrought with his trademark vivid green, red, and blue shades of film color, the movie flows along a nostalgic dreamland in a would-be (or could-be) Paris.  Chance. Fate.  Ah Amour!  It was chance that Jeunet even found the script for this movie (you will find this out from one of the fantastic extras on this DVD).  The enchanting Audrey Tautou was not the original choice for lead actress and had to go through a screen test, but without her would there exist an Amelie at all?!<BR>Whether or not you enjoy romance, a good mystery, or just good movies you will thoroughly enjoy this one.<BR>This is an excellent movie...if you don't mind subtitles (for all of us non-French speakers)!<BR>Even now after four viewings I can't help but wonder if the gnome will travel again--where will he travel to next?!
0694003611|5.0|This should be one of the first books you introduce to your child.  Children love to interact with this book by pointing out all the things in the room.  You will soon find that your child has memorized the story and can say it along with you.<br />Children never tire of hearing about the bunny who tries to prolong his bedtime by saying goodnight to everything in his room.  And you will never tire of reading it to them.
B00000IREA|4.0|I first saw Barbarella when I was 12.  It was on the USA network on July of 1987.  I didn't really know what was happening, and I was reading the Sunday comics while watching it.  But the scene that got my 12 year old mind's attention was when Barbarella appeared to be naked in some sort of strange box with cables and lights all around it.<BR>The evil doctor appeared to be playing a musical tune on it and the machine started to do a wave motion over her body.  She was squealing and smiling and looking nervous and happy at the same time.<BR>The machine was doing something to her, but I wasn't sure what.  All I remembered was that whatever it was doing, it was doing it to her naked body.<BR>That scene and the vision of her naked in the machine was my obsession for the next three years as I searched every video store to find the movie.  At that time you couldn't find it anywhere.  It was out of print and no one seemed to know what I was asking for.<BR>Well to make a long story short, here we are over 15 years later and I have a massive Barbarella collection.  I am still obsessed with Barbarella and the scene where she is tortured inside the sex machine.  It is still one of the most erotic things I've ever seen in any movie.  Even hardcore porn, which really bores me, doesn't top it.<BR>The idea that a woman can be forced to endure incredibly intense yet unbearable sexual pleasure as a form of torture fascinates me.<BR>Even cartoons borrowed the Sex Machine scene.  An Anime cartoon called F3: Frantic, Frustrated, and Female showed the girl being subjected to a tireless sex machine being operated through a musical keyboard by a mad scientist.<BR>I am not alone here.  There are websites devoted to Barbarella and the sex machine as well as numerous other Barbarella sites.<BR>The dvd only contains the movie and the trailer, nothing more.<BR>I would love to see an Ultimate Edition Barbarella DVD with deleted scenes, extended takes, Jane Fonda commentary, still photos, wide screen and full screen options, all the bells and whistles but I know it will never happen.<BR>I give the dvd four stars because for as popular as this movie has become, the dvd should have had more on it.<BR>This movie still contains the Ultimate Sexual Fantasy for me and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have for the last 15 years.
B000000XB9|5.0|CCR may not have been revolutionary--their style was by-the-numbers blues, country, and rockabilly. But damn, John Fogerty could pen a great tune without ever sounding crass or poppy.<br />Although Chronicle Vol.1 will not cover everything they did, it is comprehensive enough for all but the most hardcore fans. Tracking down the original LPs is not an easy task these days, so it's good to have this single-disc retrospective of CCR's career on hand.<br />These guys were sincere in what they did and although CCR had many popular singles over their five-year existence that enjoyed heavy airplay, they never really got the recognition they should have. John Fogerty and his band deserve to rank up there with the Rolling Stones and Beatles for crafting superb rock 'n' roll straight with no chaser. Fortunate Son, Up Around The Bend, Travelin' Band, Green River, Run Through The Jungle, and everything else are all timeless. However, if I had to name a favorite, it's probably their take on Heard It Through The Grapevine, which becomes a menacing and focused blues jam that goes for a solid 11 minutes without dragging.<br />When you become a parent, buy two copies--one for yourself, and one to hand down to your kids. In this age of manufactured pop-punk and tepid nu-metal, parents should show their children how true rock 'n' roll is done. This is the perfect start to their library.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I cannot improve too much on the comments from the gentleman from California. It was a complex movie--a thinking person's movie--and the odd movement that sprung up within its context could hardly be characterized as excessively respectful of authority figures (the hallmark of fascism), or indeed of even society itself. Indeed, if you are foolish enough to judge Fight Club (the fictional Club in the Movie) in real-world terms, it was plainly message-driven rather than leader-driven: Some may recall the scene in which Cornelius nearly loses his manhood! I don't want to say any more; I've given away too much already. For those who want a wonderfully weird, HILARIOUSLY funny, bizarre, smart movie that disturbs you repeatedly but leaves you cheering in the end, I STRONGLY recommend \\"Fight Club\\"! Don't let curmudgeonly reviewers who cluelessly focus on ALL the WRONG things scare you off!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|&quot;The Beatles 1&quot; is a solid choice for anyone seeking a basic, entry-level introduction to the Beatles' impressive body of work.  You get all of the songs which, 30 years later, are still staples of popular culture and radio with sound quality that's better than any other major Beatles release so far.  How can you go wrong with any CD that includes &quot;She loves you,&quot; &quot;I wanna hold your hand,&quot; &quot;A hard day's night,&quot; &quot;Ticket to Ride,&quot; &quot;Help,&quot; &quot;Yesterday,&quot; &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; &quot;Hey Jude,&quot; and &quot;Something&quot; on it? (Not to mention countless others...every track is good.)  For the newcomer, this disc gives all the important points: the singing, playing, and pop ingenuity and creativity that made the Beatles the most popular, influential, and important group of all time.<br />However, what this disc lacks, and what makes it inferior to the priceier Red and Blue Albums, is a look at the broader scope of the Beatles' work, and not just their singles.  Throughout their career, the Beatles remembered the importance of hit singles.  A solid hit was always the group's passport into the future, but a great deal of their &quot;meatier&quot; work was reserved for the 13 excellent albums they released.  One of the things that &quot;1&quot; lacks is a lot of John Lennon's classic album tracks that have become staples of the group's legend: in later years, Paul was the one who wrote more of the singles, while most of Lennon's work appeared on albums or B-sides because it was less commercial. Thus, we don't get &quot;In My Life,&quot; &quot;I Am the Walrus,&quot; &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; or &quot;Revolution.&quot;  All of these certainly belong in the group's greatest hits.  Coversely, we miss Paul's rock moments, as we only see his pop here.  Where is &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;Back in the USSR&quot;?  By simply focusing on the singles, we miss some essential Bealtes moments.<br />It's clear what EMI/Apple/Capitol was trying to do here...make a 1-disc, affordable version of the Beatles Greatest Hits.  Problem is, the Beatles work is too GOOD and too plentiful to fit on a single disc.  They did an admirable job of creating a one-disc set for new fans, but in order to get a proper picture of the band, you need more than just this set.  If you're only going to buy one Beatles disc (highly unlikely, and not recommended), buy either the Red or Blue Album, depending on which side of the group you want, Pop ('62-'66) or Rock ('67-'70), respectively.  If you just want an idea of their hits before entering into the group's album catalog, this isn't a bad choice.  Just beware, this is not a &quot;Beatles: Ultimate Collection.&quot;<br />And finally, for the purists, the only reasons to purchase are: 1) Because you're such a fan you can't NOT, 2) Because of the better sound quality.  As has been noted elsewhere, the stereo mixes, and not the original mono ones, are used here.<br />Nevertheless, this shows a small slice of the Beatles, but a tasty enough one to get some idea of why these guys are still getting played 40 years later.  Gear!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|how can you not love this movie?  I grew up with ET, owning the DVD was a must.
0743455967|5.0|Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of Stephen King. Nothing against him, I'm just not interested in the genre he typically writes in. I've not really seen any of the movies based on his books, except for the first half of Carrie, (the old one), the whole Carrie, made for TV version, the last part of misery, and Rose Red.<br />But I was eager to get a book on writing written by one of the most famous writers of our time.<br />King's writing is simple, straight-forward, and just plain blunt.    He cuts to the quick, but makes it easy to understand why some people, no matter how hard they try, will never be great writers, but a few can be good. <br />Even more, he illustrates from his own life how writing is, and how it comes to be, and how it can affect one's life.<br />Finally, King was right to pay tribute to Elements of Style, by Strunk and White, the essential tool for all writers.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It's a must watch.. over and over again.  It's an amazing movie that reminds you of what heros are really made of.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Having followed the career of Cat Power (aka Chan Marshall) for the past few years I was excited about the upcoming release of You Are Free. I was also fortunate enough to catch her live show in NM the weekend before the album was released.<BR>Hands down this is her best album to date. Her mysterious voice (a Kim Carnes raspiness but also with incredible power) still is as infectious as ever. It is hard to find another female vocalist who can even compare to her. Although she has not found the recognition she deserves, this album may start to get her new recognition. <BR>In concert she remains a quiet recluse (she sat for the majority of the concert so one could barely see her behind her long hair.) Although not the best stage presence, she takes and grabs hold of you on this album. At times tragic, this album is still the easiest of her albums to approach. Overall an excellent album throughout and the best to start with of all of the Cat Power lexicon.<BR>I originally gave this 4 stars but over the last week of listening it has gotten under my skin...so a 5.
B000065U1N|5.0|the feeling you get for the men and women who serve our country after watching this movie.  Every time I watch it I get chills.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Ok so Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was great, and Beck's new album was as usual unpredictable, but this band from Oklahoma has stepped it up a notch.  This album is by far the best album of the year.  Songs 1, 2, 3, 4 are the absolute highlights - particularly # 2 with which you have to crank the bass to get the full effect.  An amazing album - rich with a depth that I am still discovering.  Has made me go back and review all their old albums.  A true gem.
B000069AUI|5.0|This cd is perfection.  It relates so well to my emotions and I just can't put it down.  I love every song but my favorites are:  Warning Sign (makes me cry), Clocks (unusually beautiful), Green Eyes and Amsterdam.  I am going to see them in concert next week and I just CANNOT WAIT[.]<br />This cd is for people who are emotionally in touch.<br /><br />I've recently purchased X&Y and although there are four excellent songs on this cd, A Rush of Blood... is much better and more unique.  Every song is brilliant.  Can't say that about most cd's.
0684847248|5.0|Reading this book has brought me understanding of situations within myself and in relation to others of why we behave the way we do.  With this understanding, I am now more aware of how I relate and react to issues and people.  I understand that we cannot change the world alone, but influence it by how we interact with the world and perceive it.  Thank you Mr. Speck!!
B000002N2Z|5.0|Yeah man....this is a great debut album from the Sacto Deftones...Chino Moreno it's a Genius....Maybe his juanita addiction made him compose real good.....Bored it's an awesome song....and ....damn dude...the whole album rule,it's perfect.
B000002PC6|5.0|This album stayed at #1 for 10 weeks. This brought Olivia to superstar status when it landed her next to the VERY FEW to ever appear on the chart a staggering 10 weeks. Among those- Elvis Presley-The Beatles-Michael Jackson.<BR>This album has everything and still today can be played and bring a smile remembering the 80's.  For those interested her latest release ( 2 ) has the new 2002 Re-Make of &quot;Physical&quot; acoustic style. Now that's something NOT to be missed.<BR>I've seen her sing this version live- it's everything you can't even imagine.  Physical has staying power- as does Olivia.
B000002J1H|4.0|Classic Yes, for sure.  I think I would actually rate this a 4.5.<BR>Turn of the Century is one of the most beautiful pieces in their whole catalog.  It is a unique love story, and always reminds me of the movie &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; with Jane Seymour. It is haunting, lovely, sad, uplifting, melancholy, and graceful, all at the same time.  Also some of the most beautifle guitar work ever.  Jon Anderson puts so much emotion into this one, I can easily be moved to tears hearing it. Wondrous Stories always makes me feel like I am drifting peacefully along on a summer day.  And Awaken, to me, this is one of those life affirming pieces of music.  Certainly it is hard to undestand the exact meaning, I have heard it is based on the Christian &quot;The Singer The Song&quot; stories, but in any case, it can transport you away.  It is beautiful, majestic, and the way the music is performed it makes me feel like I am floating up toward the sky every time.  I am not sure how they did it, but wow.  I had the pleasure of hearing this performed live last year, and the vibe, the energy in the room was incredible. Awaken does something to me everytime I hear it.  As far as the title track and Parallels are concerned, I enjoy them, the rocking of GFTO, and the majestic playing of Squire and Wakeman on Parallels, but the other three songs are my favorites on this record.  Give this one a try if you can, you will not be disappointed.
B000002KHB|4.0|I've listened to Deep Purple In Rock and that was a great album too, but I'll be damned if I didn't say that this was the best and most consistent Deep Purple album ever. The band had cemented its best-ever lineup of Jon Lord (organ), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Ian Gillian (vocals), Ian Paice (drums), and Roger Glover (bass). The result was the '72 classic Machine Head.<br />Yes, everybody and their mother knows Smoke On The Water and its oft-imitated classic riff. It's a strong track to be sure.  However, that's not what makes this album a standout.<br />Machine Head opens up with the scintillating Highway Star, an ode to the opposite sex and breaking the speed limit, probably my favorite track here. Then it goes to the slower, grooving Maybe I'm A Leo and the underrated rockers Pictures Of Home (opening with Paice's breakneck drumming) and Never Before. After Smoke On The Water, the long jam Lazy asserts itself with Lord's organ playing. This is a great song, with some really tasty organ and Blackmore's guitar work playing off each other. It may be close to 8 minutes, but it never feels that long. Finally, Machine Head ends with the trippy Space Truckin', an exuberant finish to an awesome album.<br />Machine Head stands as not only Deep Purple's best effort, it also ranks among the best metal releases ever, despite the fact that it's a little short (and yes, Smoke On The Water has been played into the dirt). Along with Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Machine Head is a seminal metal album and an essential recording for all.
B000088E6D|3.0|Best track of this CD is &quot; That's All &quot; , thanks to brilliant Johnny Mandel's arrangement ! Wish he'd arranged the whole CD !
B000084T18|5.0|Unlike Eminem, 50 doesn't rap about his family, such as his son. If you're trying to base your decision about buying this album from hearing the song \\"Wanksta\\", then don't buy it. Although \\"Wanksta\\" is a very creative song, the style on Get Rich... is mostly enhanced brilliantly by Dre's incredible beats along with Eminem's influence on 50. When you compare \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Don't Push Me\\" to his earlier songs, his ealier songs don't even come close to matching the caliber. In this ablum you'll hear the latest lyrical battle between Ja Rule and 50. In \\"Back Down\\" he says, \\"I'm back in the game shorty to RULE and conquer, to sing for h**s and sound like the cookie monster.\\" You all know these battle always add a little extra to an album. So this ablum is already gigantic and will continue to grow as people discover 50 cent's unbelievable god-gifted talent for the rap game. And if you're a Dre fan then here's another young artist to keep him in this industry longer. Much appreciation for Eminem, Dre., and 50, so keep the hits coming and I'll keep buying them.

B000002UEB|5.0|Queensryche are really a unique band.  My introduction to them was their 1990 release EMPIRE, and that was a really fantastic album.  So I decided to get that album's predecessor next, which was their legendary concept album OPERATION: MINDCRIME.  I thought the band couldn't top EMPIRE, but I was proven wrong yet again.  MINDCRIME is in every way, shape, and form a perfect album.  There is not one ounce of fat or tedium throughout this entire 60-minute disc.  All 15 songs flow smoothly together, one after the other, telling an incredibly powerful and moving story that's almost like listening to a movie instead of watching it.  The fact that Queensryche would follow this up with the equally amazing EMPIRE is just as astonishing.  But enough about EMPIRE -this is MINDCRIME we're talking about here.<br />The protaganist of the story is Nikki, a disillusioned young man who despises everything America has become in the 1980s, thanks to corrupt politicians, sleazy televangelists, and the just-as-corrupt media.  He wants to do something about it, and finds his calling in \\"Operation: Mindcrime,\\" an underground organization run by Dr. X that assassinates any of the aforementioned that comes their way.  Mindcrime also hooks their assassins on heroin for reasons that I won't mention (they play an important part later).  Nikki soon falls for Sister Mary, a reformed prostitute turned nun.  I'll stop here, because the story takes on a few twists and turns that I won't reveal.<br />Singer Geoff Tate and guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton wrote most of the lyrics, and I like the fact that they don't give you any easy answers.  The story is easy to follow, but it also make you question some of the reasonings behind it, which makes for an incredible experience.  The musicianship is top-notch.  DeGarmo and Wilton lash out some of the best twin guitar harmonies this side of Iron Maiden, and Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield keep everything anchored with solid percussion andheavy basslines.  Geoff Tate is really the standout here.  This man can sing!  You have to hear some of the stuff he does with his voice on this album.<br />All I have to say is go out and buy OPERATION: MINDCRIME.  You won't regret it.  This is truly a landmark in progressive hard rock/metal music.  Before I close out, here's a list of some of the highlights on the album.  Enjoy!:<br />\\"Revolution Calling\\" (track 3)--A powerful rocker with hard-hitting lyrics and a catchy chorus.  They still open their concerts with this song.<br />\\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" (track 4)--The awesome title track with fiercely heavy grooves and lots of attitude in the vocals.  Another great chorus as well.<br />\\"The Mission\\" (track 7)--A haunting piece of work with nice synth inflections and some stunning guitar work.<br />\\"Suite Sister Mary\\" (track 8)--A 10-minute mini-opera with eerie orchestrations from composer Michael Kamen and a powerful duet between Tate and female singer Pamela Reed (who plays Mary on this track).<br />\\"The Needle Lies\\" (track 9)--The heaviest song on the album.  It also has a great message on the dangers of drug abuse.<br />\\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" (track 15)--The most perfect album closer of all time.  Great lyrics, unforgettable melody, and a passionate performance from Tate.  He really goes all out on this one!
0385486804|5.0|Krakauer, who has become quite well-known for his man-against-nature reporting has written a fascinating report of Alex/Chris McCandless's hubristic attempt to out-Thoreau Thoreau.  Apparently a very likeable and intelligent young man, McCandless not only revered Thoreau's back-to-nature writings - and civil disobedience, but more about that later - he also admired and had read Jack London, John Muir and Tolstoy.  Unfortunately for him, he made a series of very simple mistakes, overestimating himself and underestimating nature.  He ignored advice from many more experienced and concerned people who could see that he was going to get himself in over his head. (Even Thoreau could stand Walden Pond for only 18 months and he was within an easy stroll of town.)<BR>      Born Chris McCandless, he changed his name to Alexander Supertramp when he began wandering around the country, usually with no money - especially after he abandoned his car when it was caught in a flash flood and he ran the battery down before the engine had dried out.  Rangers later found the car and used it for many years in drug stings - it ran beautifully. He, in true Thoreauian fashion as interpreted by Chris from Thoreau's book On Civil Disobedience, didn't think it was necessary to get his car registered or to renew his license, so when the car's battery ran down, he couldn't very well ask for official assistance given all the registration issues that would present themselves. It was then that he took completely to foot, and he burned (literally) the $120 he had left. During the trek through the Southwest, he was helped by many people, who picked him up as he hitchhiked.  On his way through South Dakota he was befriended by a rancher who took him in rather than turn him back out to thumb a ride in the rain, and Chris worked for him off and on, periodically leaving to go on another trek.  It was his decision to test himself in Alaska that was to prove his downfall.<BR>      He explained his rootlessness to a friend on one occasion as a disinclination for monotony, but his gift of a $40,000 trust fund bequest to OXFAM, suggested a more substantial rejection of society.  Alaska was much less forgiving than the Southwest, with fewer roads, fewer people to bail him out, and wildlife unlike what he was used to.  All he had to go on was a 10 lb. bag of rice, a .22 caliber rifle (not a large enough bore to hunt for food successfully), insubstantial boots, and thin clothes.<BR>     Ultimately, Chris lacked the skills to survive and at the end realized it.  He left a note desperatly pleading for help on the abandoned bus in which his body was found just two weeks after his death.  McCandless represents irrationality born of a uniquely American nostalgia for wilderness and the ever-receding frontier, combined with our incessant interest in high-risk activities.
0060278269|5.0|As I have said in previous reviews, a book should not be judged by its cover, nor by its genre, which, unfortunately, some people do.  I believe that a book should be judged by its quality, and I direct this at those who are like my friends and do not like fantasy nor science fiction books.  Abhorsen, as well as its two prequels, exceeds my standards for a great book and it should do so to even those who do not like to read these types of books.  Abhorsen is written in such a descriptive way that the reader can automatically picture the main character Lirael, Daughter of the Clayr, and her companions as she battles her way through the dead armies and tries to stop the rconstruction of the Destroyer, otherwise known as Orannis.  The book continues straight from where it left off in Lirael, and it continues as Lirael travels ever closer to the Red Lake, and closer to Nicholas Sayre, a young man whose fate is entertwined with her own.  Although it may not sound interesting to some people, it is a great book for all readers, and everyone should enjoy this book immensely.  I know that I did, and hopefully Garth Nix shall continue to produce works as great as this Abhorsen trilogy.

Although praised for its graphic opening, the author paints a very simple picture of complex subjects (rape, murder and divorce to name a few) and has trouble finding an ending. Save your money and take a walk in a park the next time you are seeking answers to life's questions.
B000002NIW|5.0|It's among the best hard rock albums there... Very agressive and beatiful songs - DEFTONES've connected the unconnectable! Album is just AWESOME! In fact, beforee it I listened some pop- or hardrock bands such as Ill Nino, Disturbed, Deftones 1 and 3 album, Linkin Park, 3rd Strike, Marylin Manson etc. Now I'm fully in this world of amazement, energy and pride - th world of Argessive Beauty... In my opinion, there are several cult tracks on album - blowing up &quot;Around The Fur&quot; - just listen to it, i cannot describe it in words... Next song - &quot;My Own Summer&quot; - has it's own style which gives it some incredible energy... Next one - &quot;Lotion&quot;... After watching video from 22.08.98 on Bizzare Fest when Deftones played it live, I was amazed how agressive and astonishing may the song be - it's the MOST ENERGYFULL and CUTTING song ever! Listen to it replaying times and times and you'll understand me... &quot;Be Quiet And Drive&quot; - just perfect hard-rock song which has all the standarts of this kind of music... And last 2 songs of album - &quot;Mx&quot; and &quot;Damone&quot; are connected to each other - while &quot;Mx&quot; is fleshy hard song, &quot;Damone&quot; sprays out all the negative energy of the album - perfect end of album...<BR>     Deftones did a lot of work and deserve to be called &quot;Among the best&quot; - in my opinion it's their best work ever...
0345448898|3.0|I liked reading the dark materials. The only mistake I made was to read the last book before the others. I read that the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" was the one to read and enjoy. However, I would've enjoyed it more had I read the other two books that came before.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Some say she's sleepy. Some say she's nothing new. Some say she lacks \\"passion.\\" None of that matters when there are only three cds in my car, and hers is one of them. What her critics seem to dislike, is what I like. The calm. The easy transitions. The soft melodies. I enjoy being able to put in the cd and never be jerked out of the reverie induced by her smooth voice and contemplative style. While most albums have the obligatory up-tempo cut, this one is consistently mellow. She's always a welcome sound during my commute, a pleasant backdrop at home while hanging out with friends, or simply being alone. It's rare that I revisit vocal cds so frequently over a prolonged period of time. I simply tire of vocal cds quickly, and revert to my perennial instrumental favorites. But hers is an exception.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This is a great action movie. As an adult, I enjoyed it. HOWEVER, due to the wonderful marketing, and the very colorful DVD case, a parent might be inclined to get this movie for a little kid. Please watch this movie before you make this decision. It is rated PG-13 for a good reason. Spider man is a good guy, but the movie is ripe with violent scenes where good-guys die. It could be very scary for the 6 and under crowd. I only write this review because my little girl begged me to rent it at the video store. I almost did, until another parent told me to be careful, Spider-Man gave his four year old nightmares for a week. <br />Parents need to make their own decisions about the level of violence in television that they expose their kids to. So, if you are careful of what you expose your younger kids to, then please preview this movie before you put it into the family video collection
B00005NRO3|5.0|The film itself is great. With enough jolts to keep you wetting the seat, and shrieks to keep you coughing, it works. From the opening scene(Which oddly looks like the opening from \\"He Knows your Alone\\") where Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens are killed to the unveiling of the killer,we are hooked.The death that stood out to me, as a stuntman, was the death of Cici Cooper(portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar). At the point of being thrown off the 3 story soroity house, I was spell bound. All I can say is that Wes Craven is a genius.
6304999275|5.0|...an unapologetic rendering of the male/female &quot;dance&quot;?<br />Historical accuracy has been rather gleefully abadoned in this (ostensible) kiddy-cartoon (as well it should - do we really want our four year olds to know what actually -did- happen to the Tsar and his beautiful family?).  While marketed to younger audiences, adults may well find the story sweet, the dialogue witty, and the music captivating.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I don't think there is a movie that has more social commentary about current American Culture than this movie. It addresses so many of the vain things we do in our daily lives as well as addressing the larger picture of life and its frailty. With excellent performances from all characters especially Spacey, this movie is a must own for any respectable DVD collection.
B000002VDW|5.0|&quot;Time Passages&quot; is a collection of well-written, finely-crafted tunes, excellently produced and absolutely guaranteed to please persons of discriminating taste.  The title track is still played extensively on many radio stations, and deservedly so.  The sentiments are sweet, suggestive of a thoughtful, Chardonnay-induced reverie into one's past.  &quot;Palace of Versailles&quot; is haunting, and &quot;Song on the Radio&quot;, while a tad trite compared to Mr. Stewart's other offerings, is just plain fun, and contains a gem of a verse:  &quot;I don't know what it was that was painful...&quot;.  Buy the album and hear the lyrics for yourself; you'll understand why I was able to use this verse very succesfully in my attempt to win over a reluctant would-be, semi-misanthropic lover...(Question is now, why did I bother....)
1559408855|5.0|If this movie was a low budget movie of an ordinary director -like texas chainsaw mess..- i could call it \\"the sickest comedy ever\\". (Yes, there are scenes that u normaly lough at, but u just cant!!!)<BR>But this movie is far beyond the sickest, most horifiying and dýsturbýng movie ever. It is just something that hard to describe!<br />\\"Funny Games\\" of Michael Haneke is like \\"Happy Days\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" of Tarantino is like \\"Snow White\\" when compaired to Salo!!!<br />Technically directing and acting is superior. But there is more than that in this movie. <br />There is no arguments like; \\"love\\" or \\"hate\\" or \\"enjoy\\" for this movie. U just hate what u see!!! And u shock and after a while u start deep thinking while feeling real bad... U think of how \\"low\\" and \\"evil\\" that the human kind can be! U start hating the human kind. (And even ur self!)<br />SALO -120 DAYS OF SODOM-  will change ur life !!! (Bealive it or not!!!)<br />Note: This movie is rated 18 but in my opinion ýt has to be rated 28 !! -Its not because of the extreme sex and violance scenes but the movie it self!!! <br />CAUTION: PARENTS BE ADVISED THAT IT CAN BE EXTREMELY HARMFULL FOR TEENAGERS. IF U BUY THIS MOVIE KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE. <BR>(ý mean it! No kidding!!!)
B00005JLEU|5.0|Chihiro, a typical slightly spoiled ten year old girl, wanders off the beaten path with her parents, and is thrust into a bewildering otherworld. Her parents have soon fallen under a malign enchantment, and suddenly it falls to her, with the aid of a mysteriously familiar boy named Haku, to rescue them. She has to decide where to place her trust, as it becomes apparent that Haku is in the service of the villainous tyrant grandmother Yabubu, who rules over this otherworld. <br />It is Chihiro's spirit that steers her through these uncharted waters. We watch her discover in herself and exhibit, tentatively at first but with growing confidence, all of the virtues a fairy-tale hero must learn: resourcefulness, compassion, politeness (hey, this *is* Japanese!) and courage. Because we've witnessed her ordinary beginnings, we identify with and believe in all her emerging qualities. It's all done with a deft matter-of-fact touch that never cloys and never preaches. The animation is quietly dazzling. The plot is dense and full of surprises. The symbolism is as exotic as a Shinto shrine, and as familiar as the echos set up by the best fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen or old Russia.<br />The cream of American animation for children in recent years - films like Aladdin or Monsters Inc - have drawn in audiences with screenplays written on a double track: a simple, comforting story for the kids, and a long series of nods and winks over the kids' heads to the adults, catering to our sense of irony and patting us on the back for catching all the topical and cinematic references. And that's been fun as far as it goes.<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" throws all that into the dustbin, goes back to the basics, to the conventions and surprises of timeless fairy tale, to a character-based humor that appeals to all ages, and to the sense of wonder that reawakens the child in everyone. It's an hour and a half of pure, funny poetry. It hits every mark it aims for. It's an unqualified classic.And it will become the first DVD I buy for my two year old grandson, even though it will have to be held in trust until he turns six, and can watch it without being freaked out by the spooky parts.
0684833395|5.0|From my title, one can assume.  I thought this book was incredible.  It was hilarious from the start.. &quot;Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.  The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice...&quot;  It didn't stop and as each character was introduced, and a whole new story was introduced, it got funnier and funnier depicting how ironically stupid the comanding officers are as well as the ridiculous rules that govern the soldiers.  Through catch 22 clauses, men are unable to fulfill the orders given, defeating the whole purpose of giving orders.   Through these clauses, men are unable to satisfy their goals which just turns the situations round and round in the most comedic way.  <br />I was intrigued by the amount each character was developed.  Almost all had a chapter dedicated to them and almost all i grew to adore. It was a film in my head, i could fit every character to a role.  <br />This book maintains its wonderful humor all the way to the end and i hope that this recommendation helps.  it was an incredible book, dont wait, start reading.
B000067J1Q|5.0|Following the success of the 1964 film \\"Mary Poppins\\", Julie Andrews starred in another sensational film only one year later, \\"The Sound of Music\\".  Directed by Robert Wise (who also directed \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" in 1971, \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" in 1951 and \\"West Side Story\\" in 1961), the film was derived from the Broadway musical created by Richard Rogers & Oscar Hammerstein II, in corroboration with writers Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse).  It was based upon the true story of the van Trapp family immediately prior to World War II.<br />Taking place in Salzburg, Austria in 1938, the film begins with a cinematically beautiful display of the Alps and Julie Andrews singing the title song.  Julie Andrews plays Maria, a young woman studying to become a nun; but Reverend Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) along with nuns Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), Sister Bertha (Portia Nelson), Sister Sophia (Marni Nixon) and Sister Bernice (Evadne Baker) aren't sure whether Maria is suitable nun material.  Mother Abbess decides to send Maria on a mission to be a governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a decorated hero of the Austrian Navy.  Captain von Trapp has had great difficulty finding a proper governess for his children, who frequently discourage any governess from remaining by using various pranks.  Initially, the children intend to treat Maria as any previous governess, but they quickly take a liking to her.  Upon discovering that the children have never sung before, Maria teaches them how to sing, to the unintended delight of Captain von Trapp's friend, Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn), who is searching for fresh musical talent.  However, Captain von Trapp does not intend to allow Max to exploit his children's previously unknown musical abilities.  Further, unexpected feelings develop between Captain von Trapp and Maria.<br />Complicating matters for Maria and the von Trapp family is the political atmosphere in 1938 Austria.  Some Austrians enthusiastically embrace the idea of Anschluss (political annexation) between Austria and Nazi Germany, but most (including Captain von Trapp) are totally opposed.  As history records, Nazi Germany takes control of Austria in 1938, and Germany's naval command wants Captain von Trapp to take command of one of its naval vessels.  Captain von Trapp instead decides to take his family to the safety of Switzerland.<br />Acting and singing in \\"The Sound of Music\\" are superb. Not only the abilities Julie Andrews (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress) eloquently showcased, but also those of Christopher Plummer and Peggy Wood (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress).  The young actors & actresses portraying Captain von Trapp's children are also very talented: Leisl (Charmian Carr), Louisa (Heather Menzies, who played Jessica in the 1977 TV series \\"Logun's Run\\"), Friedrich (Nicholas Hammand, who acted in many TV series including \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" as Spider-Man in 1978), Kurt (Duane Chase), Brigitta (Angela Cartwright, who also played Penny in the 1965 TV series \\"Lost in Space\\"), Marta (Debbie Turner) and Gretl (Kym Karath. who also played Maggie in the 1963 film \\"The Thrill Of It All\\").  Also putting in wonderful performances are Eleanor Parker as the Baroness, Ben Wright as Herr Zeller and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe.<br />Songs from the film include:<BR>* \\"The Sound of Music\\" (5+/5, Julie Andrews). Overlooking the Alps.<BR>* \\"Preludium (Dixit Dominus)\\" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).  At the abbey.<BR>* \\"Morning Hymn/Alleluia\\" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).  At the abbey.<BR>* \\"Maria\\", (5/5, Peggy Wood but dubbed by Margery McCay, and the nuns). At the abbey.<BR>* \\"I Have Confidence\\" (5/5, Julie Andrews).  Maria en route to Captain von Trapp's home.<BR>* \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" (4.5/5, Charmian Carr and Daniel Truhitte). A secret rendezvous.<BR>* \\"My Favorite Things\\" (5+/5, Julie Andrews and the children).  During a thunderstorm.<BR>* \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" (5+/5, Julie Andrews and the children).  On a picnic.<BR>* \\"The Lonely Goatherd\\" (5+/5, Julie Andrews and children).  At the puppet theater.<BR>* \\"Edelweiss\\" (4.5/5, Christopher Plummer).  After the puppet show.<BR>* \\"So Long, Farewell\\" (5/5, the children).  Before the stairway.<BR>* \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" (5+/5, Peggy Wood, but dubbed by Margery McCay). At the abbey.<BR>* \\"Something Good\\" (4.5/5, Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer).  Outside.<BR>* \\"Processional/Maria\\" (4.5/5, nun's chorus).  Maria's wedding to Captain von Trapp at the abbey.<BR>* \\"Edelweiss\\", (5/5, Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews, children & audience.)  At the Salzburg talent show.<BR>* \\"So Long, Farewell (Reprise)\\" (4.5/5, the children).  At the Salzburg talent show.<BR>* \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain (Reprise)\\" (5/5).  Crossing the Alps into Switzerland.<br />Robert Wise earned two Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture for \\"The Sound of Music\\".  The film also won Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music Adaptation and Best Sound, and received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Costumes and Best Set Design.  Overall, I rate this film with 5 out of 5 stars.  Some people do not enjoy the film at all, but most people will be endeared to Maria, Captain von Trapp and the von Trapp children.  I highly recommend purchase of this DVD.

B0000648WZ|4.0|I won't go into detail about the premise or plot of the movie. You can read numerous other reviews on that. This is to address the movies satire and RH's literary outlook. First off, this movie is a satire and there is a lot of violence in the movie, yet that is the purpose and I believe it is notably achieved. It only takes one look at the movie to understand what is really going on, or maybe it may take a couple of looks for those who can't see beyond the violence and/or pretty teen faces. For anyone who has seen the documentary Hitler movies depicting the Nazi regime this movie is a testament to the craziness of facism. I was nearly rolling off my couch at the gung-ho teen warriors ready to fight and die for a cause that is ridiculous.  The fight and the war are the only things that hold the society together. Facism desperately needs an enemy, hence the fight against the bugs. Peace and resolution are never an option. This is not that hard to see folks. I could write a 15 page paper on this movie and its obvious relation to society and Nazi Germany. This is what RH was trying to get across. Anyone who doesn't see that needs to read that book again.<br />For those of you who miss the high-tech space machinery used by the infantry then I suggest you get a grip. It's a movie dang it! You are not going to see every little detail.<br />Overall this is a good sci-fi flick even if you miss the parallels. I give it 4 stars because it is entertaining.
B000002UB3|5.0|Yes, &quot;instrumental&quot;. This is not, by any reasonable estimation, the most memorable set of lyrics ever penned. But the performance ... oh my goodness.<br />Grab yourself a quality music system, sit down and relax. Turn off the lyrics in your mind ... hear those voices as instruments. And then hear all of the other instruments ... the rock steady drumming, the melodic bass, that incredible slide guitar (hint: if you didn't realize the solo on Something was done on a slide, you really need to sit down and listen to the whole album again with a good set of headphones). And finally the voices, individually and in harmony. It almost touches the transcendant.<br />And then the production. Listen to how these things are put together, both individually and as a set. The bass line changing as a song goes on ... the way the the crickets connect You Never Give Me Your Money and Sun King ... the perfect pause between She Came in Through The Bathroom Window and Golden Slumbers ... and did I mention the guitars? Headphones, campers! Headphones!<br />It's possible, I suppose, to debate the quality of the compositions. I tend to love most of it, particularly the variety of musical styles that the Beatles always served up. But one thing I can say with certainty: given this set of songs, no other group but the Beatles could have produced Abbey Road.
B00006690G|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR HIS BEST ALBUM EVER I TOTALY GIVE IT FIVE STARS AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A COPY. THIS CD IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF LISTINING TO. I DO HOPE HE COMES OUT WITH ANOTHER ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME THINGS I DONT LIKE BUT THOSE ARE THE SKITS AND SOILDER. BUT OTHER THAN THAT THE CD HAS BLOWN ME AWAY AND I THINK THAT THIS TIME HE HAS GIVEN AN EFFORT I HAVE LISTINED TO IT EVERY DAY SINCE IVE GOTTON IT. LIKE I SAID I GIVE IT FIVE STARS AND HOPE HE MAKES ANOTHER  <BR>EMINEM ROCKS!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Given what's on the market today, Norah Jones is a breath of fresh air. She doesn't have all the secrets of life at 22, but she's a good sight further down the road than some of these 18 year olds.<br />Jones has a beautiful, smoky voice that makes this album perfect for rainy day listening. I put it on to unwind, and I must confess that I don't pay so much attention to the lyrics. Some of the song lyrics I love, like Come Away with Me and Don't Know Why, but overall the beauty of this album is in the arrangements of the melodies and the loveliness of Jones' voice, which are worth the price any day. The Nearness of You has to be one of the best versions I've heard. Truly a talent that will stick around and get better with age.
0800135954|5.0|This movie was graphic in every sense of the word.  It was also dramatic in every way possible.  It follows three brothers and their father through a large portion of their existance.  The movie is a masterpeice and makes sure that it shows even the most unpleasant aspects of life in full color.  Those who don't often like movies with nudity or violence should not watch this one, but to those who can see past some of the initial shock should find this movie very enjoyable.  It is long, but I was so caught up in the story that I never even noticed.  In my opinion it was an exceptional film, with a remarkable story to tell.  I would recommend this film to anyone.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This movie is perfection.  Joan Crawford deserved the Oscar for her performance as Mildred and frankly, she should have boiled her nasty, hateful, needs a very serious beat-down daughter Veda.  I never grow tired of this movie.  Last year, I had the pleasure of seeing this movie again on the big screen in our city.  I took a friend who never heard of the movie.  She is in love with it so much that she bought the DVD.  She too would like to catch Miss Veda in a dark alley and give her what for.  This movie is whitty, smart and touches just a little too close to home.  It was definately ahead of its time.
079213690X|5.0|I have never seen a film quite like this one. It has romance, action, suspense and humor. In my opinion this is best type of film to watch. You quickly become involved with the characters and their lives as the film travels through the life and times of William Wallace.  The characters are witty, smart, and devoted to their cause.  This is a film that gives what  Iwould interperate as a realistic snap shot of the place and the area as well as it's people.  <br />A word of caution should also be given to those that are not up to the graphic battle scenes.  Although I can't say that I have ever seen a human killed, I don't think my estimation of how realistic the battle scenes really are is very far off.  Watch out for the sound track as well. The music is hauntingly beautiful.
6305089957|1.0|I am not a fan of the Scream movies.  I only bought the movie because I like Liev Schreiber.
630575067X|4.0|The Phantom Menace was probably the most heavily anticipated movie in history. Since Star Wars hit the silver screen in 1977 I haven't heard many ask about how the characters got to where there were, but I didn't hear one complaint about possibly learning of the character's pasts as everyone rushed to the theater to find out. The final product failed to live up to the expectations set for it however.  Don't get me wrong the Phantom Menace is not a bad film, and the special effects are incredible, but the plot seems disjointed as it bounces around from scene to scene possibly confusing some of the viewers.  Not to mention that quite simply this episode just had some very big shoes to fill.  <br />The cast did a wonderful job, and I couldn't have enjoyed the preformances more.  I was also touched by the fact that George Lucas stuck to so much of his original effects from the previous three movies.  I would have never guessed I could have been paying this muh attention, but it quickly dawned on me that Han Solo might be missing, but the vehicles that everyone flies around with sound just as they would have in Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
B00005JL78|3.0|Never have I come away from a film feeling so torn between aggravation and exhilaration. Brilliant idea for a story by Mr. Dick but stretched into something it wasn't. If you want plot read the other reviews; I'm cutting to the good and the bad.<br />The Good:<br />-- The look of the movie works for me. Bleach-bypass, whatever that means, is not a process I hope to see more than occasionally, but for this movie it works.<br />-- The effects were awesome. I didn't find them cheesy in the least. Love the vertical highways and spyders.<br />-- The judicious use of gross-out gags worked too, believe it or not. I understand others' objections, but for me they injected a bit of goofiness into an otherwise grim-faced film noir.<br />--  The performances were exactly what they needed to be (though Farrell was a bit too smug). And this may render my opinions obsolete with many of you, but I like Tom Cruise.  Sorry I can't be part of your club now.<br />The Bad:<br />--  Much ado has been made about plot holes, and for good reason. Much as I tried to just go with it, the movie's logic doesn't even make sense in terms of it's own reality. <br />Anderton's crime was not premeditated and thus should have been predicted via red ball only minutes before it happened. Yet, conveniently for the plot, it comes down as a brown ball, giving our hero 36 hours to figure out what's going down.<br />The need for wooden balls is briefly (but only semi-satisfyingly) addressed, and he eyeball-access I could grudgingly excuse. Maybe no-one thought he'd be dumb enough to come back to Precrime HQ, and after he was haloed who would possibly have any need to use his eyes to access anything. Yeah, it's a stretch, but I can go there. BUT ask yourself this:<br />Exactly how did the \\"bad guy\\" set up Anderton? I mean, try to walk yourself through what he would have had to do to make this work, even granting that the future is predictable. It can't be done. The precogs vision of the Crow murder sets offthe events that lead to the murder itself. I haven't read all 500 reviews, but can someone help me with this? No murder was in motion until the \\"killer\\" saw himself killing someone.<br />-- Lastly, the last 45 minutes of the film were a big come-down. Here I'm expecting some type of philosophical or moral dilemma to drive the resolution, but instead we get some standard b-grade catch-the-killer scenes. This starts with a scene ripped right from LA Confidential and is propelled forward by the old killer-blurts-out-information-he-shouldn't-have-known cliche. Lost a star right there, with one line. Finally, when our boy knows he's caught, a room full of suits sees Samantha's vision of his crime on their wall-screen. Fine and good, except that up until that point she hadn't seen the killer's face. Why was she suddenly able to see it other than to maximize the drama?<br />That's my list of complaints, but believe it or not I still enjoy watching this one. Dripping snot, moldy sandwiches and all it was a five-star classic through the first 90 minutes. Sadly, Spielberg's writers didn't have the chops or the patience to end it with substance. I suppose one man's cliche is another man's homage.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein is one of the best bands out there. I think some shy away because of the fact that it is a German group, but they shouldn't. If this heavy metal band were American breed, they'd be the top dawg. However, because they aren't, they don't get much airplay on the radio. The thing that makes Rammstein so special is their diversity and consistency. The best song on the album is &quot;Zwitter&quot; but other hidden gems are &quot;Rein Raus&quot;, &quot;Mutter&quot;. &quot;Links 234&quot;, &quot;Sonne&quot;, and &quot;Ich Will&quot; are the three singles by the group, and the XXX single &quot;Feur Frei&quot; is probably the worst song on the album and its a good song!
B00006F83Y|1.0|Not something to be taken litely, and not something I normally fling around, it's easy to say this is the worst album I've ever heard. It was poison to the ears.<BR>At first, I was excited for this album; I genuinely liked &quot;No One Knows,&quot; and I still do, despite it being overplayed, and Dave Grohl rocks. However, upon hearing the full album, I was severely disappointed. The drumming ranks among Dave's best. But the rest sounds like someone turned their instruments on, and shoved them into a blender, and let it run.<BR>If you want to spend your money on an album, pick up the Foo Fighter's &quot;One By One&quot; or the new &quot;Nirvana&quot; compilation. Completely bypass this album.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|'200 KM/H In The Wrong Lane'the debut English language album from Russian Techno-pop Duet t.A.T.u. (Comprised of Julia Volkova And Lena Katina) has to be, by far, the best album of this year<br />it's comprised mostly of hard guitar influenced dance tracks that will leave you begging for more, it leads into its slower moments with ballads (&quot;30 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Stars&quot;, and the oh-so-creepy &quot;Clowns&quot;) that will pull at your heart strings more than any pop ballad you've ever heard, after those are the Russian versions of &quot;All the things she said&quot; (Ya Soshla S Uma) and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; (Nas Ne Dogoniat) ..even if you dont speak the language (i personally dont) you cant help but realise the strength of there voices and the harsh-ness of the original language<br />Beautiful voices...<BR>Great Beats...<BR>intelligent songwriting...<BR>its like nothing you've ever hear before<br />theres old pop...and then theres t.A.T.u.
B00005UDFZ|5.0|What a great find!  Watching Bernstein conduct his most famous popular piece is amazing.  His wit, style, temper, intensity are all present.  A very straightforward account of the recording of this double cd set using opera stars as &quot;cast&quot; members.  All of the stars perform well.  <br />Carreras is an interesting study here as he takes on the role of Tony.  A very talented man, he is at once brilliant and very human as he tries to overcome his inner demons.  His &quot;Maria&quot; is especially fine.<br />The chorus performs well also.  All in all a tribute to Leonard Bernstein while serving as a behind the scenes peak at true creativity.

Lowry draws the reader in with the enigmatic workings of this world, and ultimately reveals this seemingly utopian society for what it truly is: a cold and cruel place where people are forced to conform or be destroyed. This is a fantastic novel which captures the reader's interest and does not relent. Perhaps the only drawback to the story is that it is too short. There are a few major plot threads left untied at the end of the book which left me curious about the aftermath to the events which played out within the novel.
B00005LC3Y|5.0|To the reviewers who blast this DVD for being a 'Full-screen' version take note. Mr. Kubrick (as all filmmakers do) shot with a 4:3 aspect ratio on film and had no intention to crop the film for theatrical presentation. As with all his films, if you are seeing it in widescreen, you are seeing only 2/3rds of what Mr. Kubrick intended, which was, the full exposed frame of film.
B00005JLS0|4.0|I saw this movie twice because I enjoyed the combination of<BR>Grant and Bullock.  At least in this movie, Grant gets out<BR>of his stock role of \\"Befuddled British Boyfriend\\" and finally <BR>plays a more mature character, albeit one who backslides into<BR>occassional silliness with Alicia Witt. Lucy Kelson (Bullock)<BR>reminded me of the strong, intelligent female characters in the<BR>old romantic comedies , think Katherine Hepburn with a little<BR>of Doris Day's dreaminess.<BR>Although the plot was a bit formulaic, setting the movie in Coney<BR>Island, my old neighborhood, added authenticity and an overall, welcome nostalgia to the whole piece.
B00007JVBI|5.0|this album is simply beautiful. it's been a long while since cat power has released an album of original songs, but this one certainly delivers. with such a beautiful voice, and simple, but sweet melodies, cat power has crafted an album of wonderful and memorable music. You are Free isn't too much of a deviation from previous cat power albums, but the album is so enjoyable to listen to that its predictability isn't a detraction, and actually makes the album that much more immediately likeable.
B00004Z459|5.0|Who ever gave this CD 1 or 2 stars doesn't know what they are talking about.  There's a reason LP sold millions of this album...becuase they are talented and they prove it.  They don't have to curse in order to get their point across, and some people say all there tracks sound the same.  That's a bunch of bs.  Get this album, it's one of the greatest out there and is in a class by itself.
B000002LR6|5.0|In the early 90s, Ministry proved to be indeed necessary to the industrial-metal scene, while continuing to preserve their status as the \\"pioneers of industrial rock\\". PSALM 69 is indeed an incredible journey of harrowing depiction, with ominous guitars, good 'n' heavy beats, and some real focus. While it remains one of the 90s most definite albums, it's also one of Ministry's most accessible albums.<br />The opening thrash of \\"N.W.O.\\" gives you a taste of things to come, with its jack-hammer guitars and then-President George Bush sample excerpt, declaring \\"we're not gonna make that same mistake...a new world order\\". Then we slide into the chilling screams and wall 'o' sound that is \\"Just One Fix\\". It's one of the most memorable tracks on the album, and remains a staple. But perhaps the most memorable is \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\", featuring Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers and some impressive musical prowess. With good reason, it propelled PSALM 69 to platinum status. <br />Other cuts that deserve mention include the eight-minute plus grind of \\"Scarecrow\\", the collage of menacing guitars and voices that is the title track, the rapid-fire pulse of \\"TV II\\", and the bleak but starkly intriguing industrial monster of \\"Corrosion\\". <br />Ministry made an impact in the 90s with PSALM 69, making a statement with the irresistible industrial/metal sound that made them popular with the rock crowd. And this album isn't just a taste of their greatness, it's a testament to the power of Ministry's music and their status as industrial metal legends. Truly one of the most definitive albums of the 90s.
0380789035|4.0|This book has caused more arguments among my friends and colleagues than any in recent memory, and for me, that's a good thing. I like the book, others love it, and some hate it with a passion. Flipping through the reviews, I see the same strength of opinion here.<br />The reason to recommend the book is the depth of allusion and the fun you'll have trying to figure who's who. Having a solid background in mythology of all kinds helps, but having a sense of humor and irony is required. The plot's the thing with Gaiman, so throw aside notions of the importance of sweeping literary prose and overly deep characterization: just enjoy the story. If you're looking for beautiful sentences, then look elsewhere.<br />Try to ignore the extreme reviews as well. This is an interesting story about the battle between the old gods (Norse, Greek, Irish, etc.) brought over with the immigrants and the new gods (TV, the internet, etc.). A good concept here ... it is well executed as well. Yeah, Gaiman's not a great writer in the purest sense, and yeah, he is not likely to win the Booker, but some of those writers can't write a story like he can. Live with it.

B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden has been a wonderful group that with only 2 albums sold millions of copies.<BR>Darren Hayes gave the voice to both albums (actually he has a solo album, but isn't as good as the ones that he made as Savage Garden), this two guys are from Australia and they both wrote all the songs.<BR>The first single of this album was \\"I know I loved you\\", a very good ballad that became an international hit, they following singles were: \\"Hold me\\" (this song for me it's the best of the album, the lyrics are really honest), \\"The best thing\\" (this is a dance song, real good).<BR>One of the songs (The animal song) was specially written for the 1999 movie, \\"The other sister\\".<BR>\\"Affirmation\\" is a great album, all the songs are good, they have rhythm and the lyrics are fantastic. I just don't get why do groups always split and when they do, they're members don't have the success that they had as a group, for me that's non sence.<BR>I hope they get together again and make a new album.<BR>Actually I think that I heard that they were couple, maybe that's why they broke the group.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Finally, someone understands that the best \\"feature\\" for a DVD is the movie itself! In this age of one money-grab DVD release after another, each with a less and less relevant set of \\"extras\\" than the last, it is a pure joy to find a true Collector's Edition that puts all of its focus squarely where it should: on the film itself (and what a film!). Roman Holiday is a wonderful movie, a no-brainer purchase by default for anyone who loves Audrey Hepburn (which I believe would be anyone who's ever seen her, but I'm biased), but it is the meticulous and caring restoration of it that makes this DVD so spectacular. Instead of just slapping a visually tired print onto DVD media and throwing in completely inane extras that no one would care about (like having people \\"comment\\" incoherently and meaninglessly over the length of the film, or having scans of every doodle that anyone on the team ever casually scrawled out on a cocktail napkin, etc. ad nauseum), Paramount did the right thing, and devoted the time, money, and skill to restore this classic film back to its gorgeous original visual form.  As for the extras, what is included is more than fine with me.  They are made up of a selected handful of relevant, watchable content, intead of the usual avalanche of meaningless garbage that most DVD \\"extras\\" lists are comprised of lately.  The only thing I could have asked for is more footage from Audrey's screen test if possible; she is as mesmerizing in it as she is in the film itself.  <br />If I do have one beef with this DVD, it is the tiniest: I don't like the artificial coloring that was used for the packaging.  It doesn't look very good, for one thing, and, by implication, it slightly cheapens the homage that the restoration work pays to this classic Black & White masterpiece. Otherwise though, I can't rate this product highly enough.  <br />It would have been easy for Paramount to take the low road, as most other companies (with the exception of Criterion, seemingly) choose to, but they didn't, and as a result, we are all lucky enough to have this all-but-perfect version of Roman Holiday available.  It's one of the very rare DVDs that is obviously a labor of love, and you owe it to yourself to own it. Not only is it worth more than its reasonable price, but Paramount very much deserves the gratitude of this film's fans and our votes with our dollars.  Thank you, Paramount, for really GETTING it, and for giving us Audrey's breakthrough film at it and her most radiant!

B000002JSV|5.0|Absolutely the best AC/DC album! I am a fan of the Bon Scott era. I am not a big fan of Brian Johnson. Powerage is just that... POWER! Great blues and unbelievable riffs! It is a shame they don't release the alternate version of this album on CD. IT's almost a totally different mix, different endings and intro's on some tracks. Some are minus background vocals, Most missing is the track that has never been released in the US. &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot;! Dynamite song with awesome Bon vocals. I have 2 copies of the alternate version LP, one from Gremany and one from England.<BR>  The Australian version is the same as the US. It's bizzare that it is not more talked about! Hopefully someone involved with the AC/DC catalog, who I believe Sony now owns with these new 2003 reissues, will read this and consider the long lost version be released with all the songs the US is missing from Australia! What a thought!  Long Live Bon!
0743216385|5.0|If you have ever read a war book it tells you what men saw, did to survive, and things that they had to do in order to accomplish something they never thopught they could do! The book I have just read is exactly like it, but better. Band of Brothers, a non fiction book is about a group of men in training to go to war! These men from easy company 105, 1st Air Borne worked together to rise above the challenges and achieve their goals! This book dragged me in so much! Band of Brother's showed a group of men working together to survive. These men had to see something that no one had ever seen before. This book shows heart, character, and it shows how men never gave up in order to survive!

B00006JJ1O|5.0|200 km/h in the wrong lane- TATU is a great album because it is varied for all age groups.<br />Just because they act like lesbians has attracted lots of attention to the extent of people threatning to sue because it is APPARENTLY promoting underage lesbian relationships well thats the media for you! But the truth is the sucess that the album has brought for Lena and Julia has nothing to do with the way they act it is because thay are great singers who sing great songs! The cover of the smiths- How soon is now is one of my favourites on the album and they have done that song great justice! Being at no1 in the uk chart is proving that they have talent!  I rate this album 5 STARS !  GOOD WORK GIRLS!
B000002NC4|5.0|There are very few albums in my world that deserves the epithet &quot;masterpiece&quot;... in the year of 1997 there were two - Radiohead's &quot;Ok Computer&quot; and Built to Spill's &quot;Perfect From Now On&quot;. Subjectivity is of course the main factor when it comes to labelling and reviewing albums, so therefor you should only use my following lines as a guide to raise an interest in this particular album, not as a definitive fact.<br />What makes an album a masterpiece could be narrowed down into just one word, namely &quot;perfection&quot;; Perfection in the songs, the construction and arrangements of the songs, perfection in the, so very important to make an album listenable all-the-way-through, order of the songs (the perfect song to open an album with, and the perfect song to end it with... and of course - the order of the songs in between.), perfection when it comes to lyrics, perfection in the sound (production) and perfection in the songtitles - &quot;Perfect From Now On&quot; has it all, even when it comes to the artwork and, of course, the albumtitle - I mean, what could possibly be more perfect as a title for a masterpiece than &quot;Perfect From Now On&quot;?<br />The opening track - &quot;Randy described eternity&quot; - has got the most fascinating lyrics I've ever read. The words are revealed in an almost stumbling way, pushed forward by the monotonous, hypnotic and psychadelic guitarmelodies of singer/songwriter/guitarist extraordinaire Doug Martsch. The moment the first line of words hit my ears I just knew I had to listen; &quot;Every thousand year... this metal sphere... 10 times the size of Jupiter... floats just a few yards past the Earth.&quot; These words, combined with the ones that followes, mounts up in a description of eternity that couldn't be more close to perfection, and I feel that I am enlightened. The rest of the songs of the album have all moved or impressed me in some kind of way; the heavy, slow nerve in &quot;I would hurta fly&quot; containing an explosion of guitarplay á la Neil Young at the end, the mindblowing intro of &quot;Stop the Show&quot;, the beautiful, increasing moog-synth in &quot;Made-Up Dreams&quot;, the diversivity and experimental changes in &quot;Kicked it in the Sun&quot; (notice Mr. Martsch's bending of the word &quot;yeah&quot;.) and, finally, the grand finale in shape of, in my opinion, the greatest song ever made - Untrustable / Part 2 (about someone else). What an ending!<br />&quot;Perfect From Now On&quot; is truly a masterpiece in my world and is most certainly perfect from the first note to the last... but hey, it's only my subjective point of view...
B000002J1Y|5.0|I read the reviews of this product and really hesitated because of the comments about the digital remastering. I was only 9 years old when the album was originally released. My older brother bought it at that time and since we shared a bedroom I was often there when he listened to it. Hence I developed a taste for Yes early on in life. When he married a few years later I ended up buying a copy for myself. Another note: we never had a great stereo system in those days so I never got to experience the LP &quot;to the max&quot; so I can't really compare the quality of the mastering of the LP with the CD. But that said I can say that the CD is great! True, it is a live performance recorded on tour in 1972. There are points in listening to the CD where you will hear hisses on high notes, applause, etc. You may wonder if your sound system has a problem! But it doesn't; it's just a CD that is true to the 1972 recording. That said, the true Yes fan will find the CD a real &quot;must.&quot; Instead of finding myself critical of the recording (and digital remastering) I find myself amazed that the members of Yes gave such a great concert! No dubbing here, no studio tricks; just true talent, and it shows through brilliantly in this recording. Howe, Anderson, Squire, Bruford, (or White), and Wakeman are in prime form here. Again, I insist that it is a must have for the Yes fan. The digital remastering preserved the talent of the members as it really was at that time, no make up, dubbing, or any other studio tricks. The CD is a jewel displaying the talents of the band. I think it sounds great.
B00000I8UF|4.0|This album was originally released with, fittingly, the simple title \\"Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers\\"; but the album was later renamed after the enormously powerful & popular track \\"Moanin'\\", the unforgettable opener.  It's an exception on the disc, being the sole composition by pianist Bobby Timmons, a gospelly tune riding Blakey's inimitable, deep backbeat.  Lee Morgan's solo on here is a classic--an outlandish performance which in its use of freak & bent notes pushes the innovations of Rex Stewart into the postbop era.  Such an approach permitted Morgan to get out from under the weight of the powerful examples of Gillespie & Brown & develop a more individual style. -- Golson, too, is superb, playing with a heated tone & extreme rapidity which make this & every other solo of his on the disc seem like a cliffhanger.  It ain't pretty or tidy but it's sure compelling.<br />Golson's compositions here show why he's considered one of the major postwar jazz composers, writing complex, memorable tunes like \\"Along Came Betty\\" that remain popular repertoire for hard bop players, & which proved staples of Blakey's book long after Golson left the band (he was only there very briefly--this is his sole Blue Note disc with the group, in fact).  \\"The Drum Thunder Suite\\", despite the rather unappetizing title, turns out to be a very ambitious & unpredictable melange of styles, all packed into an economical 7 & a half minutes--far from some leaden drum feature for the leader.<br />If I rate this album at less than five stars, it's simply because of a couple of minor flaws.  One is that the album's original side A is much the stronger, & there's something of a falling off towards the end of the disc, with the uptempo version of \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" comparatively ordinary.  The other thing that bothers me here is the playing of Bobby Timmons, a player who has his admirers but whom I find rather predictable and lightweight.  He loves to clatter away with bluesy chords on hissolos, drops into triplets with maddening predictability (sample his solo on \\"Along Came Betty\\" for an example), & tends in general to stick to routine.  He sounds good on \\"Moanin'\\" itself but terribly banal on \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\", for instance.<br />Such flaws are really no more than minor quibbles: this is one of the essential Blakey albums, & a welcome entry in the RVG series of fresh remasterings.
B000002UYZ|5.0|The Beatles 1962-1966, also known as the &quot;red&quot; album, along with its counterpart, 1967-1970, the &quot;blue&quot; album, make a great starter combination for new fans.<br />1962-1966 is packed with great music, from the early hits &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot; to the beginning of the experimental era with &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot; You get all the key A-side singles not found on the regular releases, such as &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; plus essential album tracks like &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Man.&quot;<br />Yes there are plenty of omissions, but the 26 tracks are all classics. I also agree that Rubber Soul is weighted over Revolver, and that there should have been a couple George Harrison tunes. And here's a final quirk. A cassette version I listened to a lot in college had the original soundtrack intro to Help!, a James Bond-like bit that gave the disk a bit of humor. That has been deleted here. I don't know why. There is plenty of time on the disks.<br />Oh well, you still can't go wrong with this collection, plus you get the lyrics in the liner notes and some fun shots of the Beatles as the mature through the 1960s.
B000001ESF|2.0|I realize that no matter how pretentious and lame this band is, there are some good solid melodies on here, despite how bad the production, lyrics, vocals, and weak sci fi themes are. It's all about the guitar melodies on this one, espeically the title track, bangkok, and something for nothing. But lessons is hideous! Still having said a few good things about it trying to rate this album as fairly and objectively as possible, this is still a terribly unattractive album to my ears. Geddy sounds worse than ever. and listen, I don't play dungeous and dragons, or anything like that, but if you feel the same way I do about this band/album, there IS one Rush cd you might enjoy, and that is Vapor Trails. It's not perfect, but the production is a million times better and even Geddy sounds bearable on that one! But why bother anyway when you can skip these fools and check out King Crimson or Yes, because those band utilized their talents to a far great extent and with a LOT more feeling and soul. Most of this band's work just sounds kind of soulless and uninspired, like they were weren't having very much fun at all. oh well, I'll stop there, before some Rush fan kicks my ass with one of those star wars light sword things!
B000002UZ1|5.0|You can't go wrong if you purchase this collection, along with the 1962-1966 compilation. Of course, why stop there?<br />I listened to my sister's copy all the time when I was in junior high, and was really bummed when she took it away. There are so many classics here that are essential to any music library: &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; kick off with a one-two double-A-side punch. Next are key tracks from Sgt. Peppers, especially the haunting &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot; Nearly everything from Magical Mystery Tour is here, please outstanding singles like &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; and of course, &quot;Hey Jude.&quot;<br />On CD 2, George Harrison finally gets his due, with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;Old Brown Shoe,&quot; &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot; I still thing &quot;Something&quot; is one of the most beautiful Beatles songs ever.<br />The Beatles had eclectic tastes, and each piece had something original, whether it was instrumentation, their use of voice, unusual lyrics, or just simple yet instantly memorable melodies.<br />Yes, the White Album is under-represented, and you miss out on the entire Abbey Road dynamic, but this collection has so much to offer.<br />Also, the liner notes include lyrics and rare photos of the band. This is a can't miss disk.
B000089CJI|4.0|For all those with a secret (and embarrassing) passion for 80s bands like Yaz and the Thompson Twins, the Postal Service is on track to make synth pop cool again.  With Ben Gibbard (on loan from Seattle's Death Cab For Cutie) laying down vocals over Jimmy Tamborello's beats, the Postal Service finds a middle ground amongst the others in the genre: not as morbid as The Faint, and nowhere near as corny as the Human League.  The idea is one that could very easily become repetitive, but Tamborello's diverse programming keeps things fresh, varying from the frantic (on the bittersweet \\"Such Great Heights\\") to the cinematic (\\"Recycled Air\\").  Songs like \\"Brand New Colony\\" are equal parts Kraftwerk and Roni Size, you'll have to hear it to believe it.  The record also benefits from guest vocals from Jenny Lewis, singer for Saddle Creek's Rilo Kiley.  \\"Give Up\\" will make you so giddy you will be breaking out your Hypercolor shirts and Members Only jackets from the deep recesses of your closet.  Check it out!<br />You might enjoy this record if you like: Death Cab For Cutie (especially the song \\"Photo Booth\\"), The Faint, Radio 4, New Order, Dntel
B000088E6D|4.0|Michael's style is simple and pure. His voice quality and diction is quite good.

B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Soundtrack is similar in many ways to his other more famous soundtracks.

This is a must-have CD for all Harry Potter Fans.

B00005QIPH|1.0|When an artist steals another group's riff, it's considered illegal (ie: the infamous Vanilla Ice), but when an artist steals another group's ideas, it's considered.....revolutionary?  In yet another hideously obvious display of calculated success, the recent \\"garage rock revolution\\" has robbed innovators of their accomplishments and continued to fuel a long line of disgusting pop culture rapes.  Nu metal, gangster rap, teeny bopper, and now garage rock. Perhaps it's just me, but with this downward spiral of no talent copycat genres purging MTV of all that is potentially creative and original, a revival of the age old \\"garage rock\\" is the very last thing that we as the listening public need.  Resurrected at least once in nearly every decade since it's original incarnation, arguably occurring around the early 60s with pre-punk pioneers like The Kinks, garage rock has already had more than its fair share of revolutionary bands.  From The Stooges to The Velvet Underground to Mudhoney, garage rock has constantly been a source of classic cult icons, spawning brilliant new ideas in the conception of underground music in America. Therefore, when a garage rock band lacks both of these most vital traits, not sparking originality in the music industry coupled with failing to build a uniquely rough sound from the ground up, the group is essentially rendered worthless.  The Strokes have failed utterly and entirely on both of these counts, committing a crime of the most heinous nature against the musical community: touting the banner of revolution, while essentially changing nothing.  Sporting riffs so bland and basic they would make even Joey Ramone cringe, an image lifted directly from a Television's Marquee Moon CD cover, and a tough guy façade so fake that it makes Johnny Rotten look genuine, the fact that this most formulated of bands has the nerve to proclaim anything as radical as a musical revolution is downright nauseating.  To think that pop music has come to such a complete standstill that it has resorted to the sorry idea of ripping off older pop music makes for a dismal picture indeed.  This disgraceful display of musical whoring and transparent \\"progress\\" has gone on for far too long already.  So I say, throw out your Strokes CD, burn your Hives T-Shirts, and throw a brick through your TV, because if you really want to hear \\"The Revolution\\", you'll listen to the bands who started all this before the almighty Strokes were even soiling their diapers.  <br />Some final recommendations to redeem your ears:  Mudhoney, The Kinks, The Stooges, The MC5, Television, The Velvet Underground, The Meat Puppets, Green River, etc.

0345347951|4.0|Of all Arthur Clarke's works, Childhood's End is not only the most disturbing but also one that truly challenges a reader. Like the best of science fiction, the nuts and bolts of spaceships and technology are but the base canvas for the painting. The title itself, Childhood's End, is loaded with several layers of meaning. On a basic level, it is the end of human life as it was conventionally known when the Overlords arrive. On the highest level, humanity itself in the end grows beyond its infancy and transitions to something beyond (and hopefully better than!) human. <br />As is the case with many of his other books, Clarke pushes his own philosophy here, having the Overlords promote and in some cases enforce causes dear to him: witness the bullfighting example and the bodily form of the Overlords. Another theme that appears in other works of Clarke is that the future belongs to the young whom he sees as more open to new ideas and less hidebound by past experiences. <br />Bear in mind here that the timeline of this book is pretty long and for that and other reasons, the story is told by different voices over the period of the book. That has its own charm as well, as one sees the nucleus of the story from multiple angles. The time factor also allows us to see how humanity evolves over the period, from fear of the Overlords, to grudging acceptance, till finally the presence of the Overlords is taken almost for granted. There are some weak parts of course; the rationale for the Overlords arrival on earth is somewhat thin and plays more to Clarke's philosophy than the logical coherence of the story. But that is just a small detail.<br />Most poignant of all, just as the \\"older\\" humans can only watch in dismay and incomprehension as their children move beyond them, in many ways, the Overlords too are left on the sidelines and share the same sentiments of loss and futility. <br />This is an awesome book. It is not a book that will cheer you, rather it will leave you disturbed and shaken at the end. But it is a book that will make you think and remember how small we are in the overall scale of the Universe. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B00004Z459|4.0|First off Paper Cut is a [great] song!... Anyways I recommend this CD for any Nu-Metal fans out there but I am pretty sure a lot of people have this CD.  All the songs are pretty good...there should be no skipping of the tracks to be done here.  <br />And if you like this CD I really, really recommend getting \\"Reanimation\\" which is the remix of Likin Park songs on this album and much more.  It's really good!... Peace Folks!...
B00005B4GU|3.0|This album, if I had to pick any (besides Pablo Honey) is their disappointment.  Without the time and focus spent on their other records, Amnesiac comes together as somewhat half-formed and cobbled together.  It feels like it has ragged loose ends all over the place, which I suppose lends to some of its charm.  Yeah, it's a Radiohead album, and it's still very good.  You can't deny the skill with which they have taken on electronica, on \\"Packt Like Sardines,\\" or the loping but still kind of compelling \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors.\\"  And the band shows their deftness on the classics \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"You and Whose Army.\\"  I have nothing against their experimentalism, as \\"Kid A\\" comes right behind \\"OK Computer\\" as my favorite album of theirs.  Nothing here, however, quite reaches the spledor or closet paranoia of its predecesor.  Thom Yorke said that Kid A was like \\"seeing the fire from a distance,\\" and Amnesiac more like being in the midst of it.  Quite the opposite, as this record just feels like after-images from Kid A (though very good ones, however).  I suggest OK Computer, Kid A, then The Bends before this flawed but nevertheless beautiful work.<br />P.S. Radiohead, however, are far from dead.  So many people criticize Radiohead for their stylistic changes of recent, and their shunning of guitars (which everyone thinks is the band's only asset).  Viewing it without any strong biases, one can see that this was essential and natural for a few reasons.  <br />First, Radiohead are intrinsically a terrific band, and no matter what medium they are in, they manage to craft awe-inspiring music.  Where their talents lie is in their core creative strengths, which in my opinion they merely filter through varied instruments, computerized or not.  The vast majority of their songs do share a quitissential \\"Radiohead\\" element, which is easy to see once one's biases are put aside.  <br />Second, Radiohead needed to evolve, or die.  Unlike bands like Pearl Jam, whom stuck with the same style for years and basically petered out, Radiohead felt they needed to change for the sake of their own artistic development.  Counting all of their b-sides, which are enough to fill another two or so albums even (and are almost all terrific), they had quite explored the big guitar-rock vein to its limits.  To do another guitar-focused album right away, while it would probably be excellent, would have probably resulted in a stylistic bottlenecking.  OK Computer was considered new and revolutionary by almost all who listened to it, and that was the real reputation they needed to live up to.  Naturally, they needed to buck trends and do something like nobody else before, thus Kid A.  <br />Lastly, NEW SONGS!  This difficult time of change led to even further evolution, and probably what would be the music they will be remembered by.  On their recent summer tours of last year, they debuted a number of absolutely fantastic songs, which reflect both the guitar sound of old but the incorporation of tempo and rhythm they learned through their experience with Kid A and Amnesiac.  Some highlights of this:<br />There There- Intense and absolutely perfect, if the live version is anything to go by.  Carries the tribal rhythms of \\"Optimistic\\" from Kid A and the caustic political rage of a song like \\"Electioneering,\\" all within a six minute whirlwind of fervor.  The new album NEEDS to lead off with this track.<br />Sail to the Moon- On the opposite end of the spectrum, the perfect album closer, dreamy and full of string-laden harmony.  Yorke's vocals are almost wordless, floating like ether, with Phil Selway's delicate drumming and crescendos of piano and guitar chords working to spectacular effect.<br />Where I End and You Begin- The definition of hypnotic, about cannibalism, domination, and undying love all in the same song.  Very echoey and rhytmic, a buildup to a climatic moment that never happens, which is the best way this song could have been done.<br />2 + 2 = 5and Up on the Ladder- Your requisite rockers, though never have Radiohead done them so masterfully.  Though a not-so veiled reference to 1984, the former has some exquisite harmonies and almost Sonic Youth-type guitar crunch, while the latter is a bile-spittiing rave-up.  <br />A Punch-Up At a Wedding- Funky and sounding like its in slow motion, this mid-tempo song has a great pulsing beat and great guitar effects, all laid over a Yorke vocal like that of old.  Shows off the synthesis of their styles in a great way.<br />Overall their new material bodes well for their future, so consider Amnesiac a minor, and necessary, misstep towards the bands perfection of their sound.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I have heard both Morning View and Make Yourself today...so like yea.....anyways....I think this one is not as good as Make Yourself but he has some good tracks on it and I think it's pretty good.<br />...  Anyways I again recommend this CD for any Nu-Metal listeners. This is a must have for Incubus fans though....GO GET IT! Peace out folks!
0380789035|4.0|I looked forward to reading this Bram Stoker award winner and having finally finished it, I was glad I did.  Although I think a lot of the middle could be trimmed down and a few of the psychedelic dream scenes edited, it was a satisfying read.  The beginning really pulled me in and was quite powerful.  Thankfully, the ending was just a powerful and made a nice bookend to the tale.  Neil seemed to wander at times, but he always managed to steer back on course.  Be warned --  this is not light reading.  Nor is this a horror novel (I'm not sure why it was nominated and won the Bram Stoker award)  Also, strangely, the idea of the plot is very similar to J. Michael Straczynski's RISING STARS comic book series.  If you want a book to pass the time, American Gods is not the one.  It is deep and thoughtful and makes the reader work for the treasures Gaiman hides inside.
B000069CWE|5.0|I am now a Linkin' Park fan and I listen to mostly rap!!!  This album is the really good with the guest appearances and the production is on point.<br />Anyone who listens to rap I think should check it out considerin' the fact that this album includes Underground rappers and I didn't expect that at all when I got it. And that's what makes this album good. I really recommend it!!!<br />I know a lot of people are going to be like I am whack cuz I don't know anybody's name in this group...but the guy that raps is really good and it sort of remindes me of Rage Against the Machine...KEYWORD...I said sort of...Don't kill me please!!!   Peace out Folks!!!
B00007H1Y2|3.0|I'll begin with my bias. I like Cuban music, especially guitar driven Cuban music. One of my favorite albums is Marc Ribot's, The Prosthetic Cubans, an album that is similar to Mambo Sinuendo in that it features electric guitar, some twangy, led Cuban music, but in practice, Ribot's exceptionally soulful guitar playing elevates it above this album, which to me is mostly just a cool concoction of sounds. But I digress. <br />This was an album that greatly interested me. But I was disapointed. The guitar playing is very ordinary and unispired, and this is a huge flaw in a guitar led album. The best tracks are those that add another instrument, such as #2, #5, and #12. <BR>I have never been too impressed with Ry Cooder as musician. His best traits are his eclectic tastes, and his ability to assemble talents to match his visions, but as a straight up guitarist, he lacks anything that distinguishes his playing from anyone else. I base this on the albums Paris Texas, Paradise and Lunch, Captain Beefheart, and his role on my least favorite track of Bill Frissel's great album, Good Dog, Happy Man.<br />My only previous knowledge of Galban is from Cachaito Lopez's album, where he was not a focal point most of the time, and did well when called upon.<br />To be fair, the rhythm section does a very good job of coming up with new, and non-typical Cuban rhythms. They are the highlight (along with the organ) grace on the album, giving it some unique energy and flavor. <br />On a side note, I thought that the recording quality was behind some of the other Cuban records of Cooder and associates, especially Lopez great bass, which seemed more muffled than usual. <br />This is an album that was flawed in that it relied on lead to heavily on less than top notch lead musicians. Dispite this flaw, this album is pretty good, partly of a rhythm section that picks up some of the guitarist's slack, and partly because surf guitar sounds cool.
B000088E6P|5.0|I just have one question.....This cd is good by the way but.....Why in the heck would you want the Clean Version of the CD?????  I have a friend who picked this one up and it just didn't sound right compared to the Dirty Version Disk...believe me get the Explicit Version for the full feel of 50 Cent!  Peace!
0786867973|4.0|I have made several recipes from the book. The molten chocolate baby cakes are amazing!! Lilly's sconces got rave reviews from my co-workers. As for the snicker doodles that the one reviewer pooh-poohed - I agree are not the ones I grew up with but I chalked that up to being the English version. For the American version see the Betty Crocker big red book. The English version are great with tea. <br />The photographs are beautiful and her descriptions make you want to try everything. <br />A great book so read, bake and grab a fork!
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I don't know what anyone else may claim, but personally, this is hands-down the cleanest, most brilliant transfer of Fritz Lang's &quot;Metropolis&quot; that I have ever seen - indeed, it's the nicest 'print' of a silent film I have ever seen. This should set a new precedent in the industry of film restoration and the folks at Kino deserve my sincerest thanks. I never thought I'd ever see Metropolis look so good - (or sound so good).<br />The score is great! I love the soundtrack. In 5.1 Digital, you simply can't beat it. It's a wonderful piece of music too - goes with the immagery better than anything I've seen before. I've always liked the piano score by Robert E. Lee, but I think this &quot;new&quot; orchestral score works even better.<br />If you like Metropolis, you MUST get this DVD from Kino! If you like sci-fi, then you also MUST get this DVD.<br />Make sure you buy the version from Kino, and don't complain that it costs considerably more than the other versions on the market - it is WELL worth it, believe me! This 2002 restoration of Metropolis is a landmark in film history, and I am happy to be a part of it!
0446677450|1.0|After reading, \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", I was very skeptical whether the author really had two dads. The story sounded too fictional and perfect. My gut was right as a magazine article confirmed there was no Rich Dad (Smart Money, Feb 03). In the article, Kiyosaki admitted Rich Dad is as real as Harry Potter. What's more, claims in the book that he purchased six properties, each for twenty thousand dollars, and then flipped them in minutes for instant profits were also false. In the records, it showed he gotten each property for over forty thousand dollars and held on to them for more than twenty months.<br />I'm tired of these get-rich-quick books.  When will people ever learn there is no such thing.  There is only one way to get rich, and that is the get-rich-slow-and-hard way.  Anyone who wants the hard truth of getting rich should read \\"A Random Walk on Wall Street\\".  This book tells of a paradox of how a \\"hot buy\\" will eventually have so many people buying it, it will no longer be a \\"hot buy\\".  Likewise, if Kiyosaki knows something we don't, that information will be useless to us by the time it is printed out.  All of the author's friends and family and their friends and family and so on, the book publishers, editors, etc, etc will probably have used his techniques many times over that they are no longer effective.  Of course, there are timely information in Kiyosaki's book such as saving more than you earn and using that money to acquire assets.  But guess what?  This is directly from \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" which its writing is ten times better than any of Kiyosaki's books.  In fact, if you read all the books in reference section of \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\", you will have realized that Kiyosaki has absolutely no original ideas of his own!<br />Who would want you to buy on the idea of get-rich-quick?  Companies like Amway.  In fact, the author's biggest supporter who was instrumental in making \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" a bestseller is Amway.  In the book, the author even supports MLM companies, no-money-down deals, and those get-rich-quick seminars!  The truth is, the author himself is guilty of being one of them.  In the end, people like him never really make money from what he preaches but only from your purchases.even supports MLM companies, no-money-down deals, and those get-rich-quick seminars!

0201626632|4.0|This book was my first book of this kind. And I was wondering about what's in the book before I bought it. I am a Ph.D. candidate who plan to graduate less than a year. Fortunately, my environment is good regarding the future planing after Ph.D.<BR>To me, most of ideas on the book were familiar concepts, my insitution, mentor, my thesis committee members, postdocs in my department are open to discuss about the issues described in the book. But! Still it was good to read through it and think about them again. I got some good points of view, and also I disagree with some apects of this book. I wish I could find more recent books that is concise and easy-to-read like this one. I have not found any comparable and inexpensive book yet.
B00005JLS0|3.0|Any film with Hugh Grant has to be a must, however 'Two Weeks Notice' just lacks that something.  Sandra Bullock and Hugh are great to watch and there is definitely a strong chemistry, but they should have found a stronger project to work together.  If you are after a feel good movie this is it, but there won't be many laughs.
B00003CXXM|1.0|It is VERY loosely adapted from the Bourne Identity and not much related to the book. I like the book very much, it's like a Harry Potter for adults, you need to read all of it to know what happens, reading the front and end doesn't make you wiser.<br />If you are interested in the movie The Bourne Identity, I'd suggest the version with Richard Chamberlain acting. In my opinion, a Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford would be better suited for the role of Jason Bourne.
0425170349|5.0|For the past 4 years I've been playing the string of games that bear Tom Clancy's name. Rainbow Six. At the time I had no clue he was really a well established author and one day saw Rainbow Six in a Chapters and realised that the game wasn't based \\"loosely\\" on the book, it WAS the book. So I bought it. <br />It was everything I'd ever wanted in a novel. Gripping action that the way Tom Clancy describes it, makes you feel like you're actually holding the HK5, looking down the sight, and popping a terrorist with 3 suppressed shots. Whats even better is how he builds it up so well, slowly, preparing you with tiny bits of information that you dont really piece together until just before hell is unleashed. <br />Since then I've read Hunt for Red October, the best novel ever, Sum of All Fears, Debt of Honour, Executive Orders and the Bear and the Dragon, all of which I recommend highly - but only if you like fast paced action and books that you absolutely cant put down.
0517543052|5.0|One of the greatest books to come out of America, EVER.  This is not just a counter-culture hippie book; it is a legitimate work of profoundly life-improving philosophy.  There are many tedious works of philosophy out there that seem to ask questions just for the sake of asking questions, and leave you with the feeling that you've only been playing fruitless mind-games.  _Be Here Now_ is not like that at all.  It addresses issues that really are important to us humans, and gives advice that can truly help you to improve your quality of life.  ... _Be Here Now_, on the other hand, shows you time-honored eastern philosophical methods which will solve your illusory problems - not just cover them up.  It also has a good moral theme to it, showing you ways to be happy without having to do so at other people's expense.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Wow! Where do I start? Slipknot is the BEST band there is out there, and always will be. This CD absolutely blows you away. All of there album's are great. They just definetly know how to play. They make Limp Bizkit look like a little sissy, girlie band. I am a total Slipknot fanatic and they are the only band I listen to, except a few others. I listen to them at least 3-4 hours a day. I love all of the songs, but I don't know which is my favorite. It would have to be between Wait and Bleed, No Life, Diluted, or Scissors. Yeah, they might be a little scary looking, but thats one of the things I love about them. How there so crazy and outgoing. The vidoes are so interesting to watch because you never know what they're going to do next. There lyrics are also exciting. They sing about the craziest stuff. Even though I am totally obsessed with all nine guys, I would have to say my favorite is the lead singer, Corey Taylor. I just think he has a great and amazing voice.
0316666343|5.0|When I was first told about this book, reactions ranged from wide-eyed wonderment to blissfull delight.  When I first started reading it, same honest feelings came through.  That's because it is a book of honest truth, of longing especially.  One who has lost someone dear on earth often wonders what is up there.  The story of Susie Salmon is the story of any young girl, from the Seventies or now, its the story of doubt, youth, wanting, giving and reassemling pieces of a puzzle-  the puzzle of one's life-  exept in this story, the protagonists life is finished, and she writes it from heaven, an interuption if you will. As she tries to get though, literally, to all her loved ones, the reader becomes emotionally tied to Susie Salmon.  So much so that it imprints your own life and makes you feel:  &quot;I'm lucky to be here&quot;.
B0000507R0|5.0|I have been a fan of this album since shortly after its release in 1973.  I have owned it on vinyl, CD, and remastered CD,and have listened to it literally hundreds of times over the years.  I can honestly say, however, that until I listened to this DVD-Audio version that I never really heard it before.<br />I always felt that Brain Salad Surgery was one of the defining works of the 1970's progressive rock movement, displaying an extroardinarily eclectic range of compositional styles, as well as virtuoso musicianship.  Unfortunately, the album sounded like it was recorded in a stairwell.  Muddy sound and an overall coldness to the recording made it less enjoyable to listen to.  <br />This Rhino remaster in Dolby Digital 5.1 for DVD-Audio solves those problems, and listening to this record has been a revelation.  Entire instrumental solos that were barely there on the original LP are now plainly audible.  Subtle reverb on reg Lake's voice during &quot;3rd Impression&quot; can now be heard.  Other examples are too numerous to list here.  Additionally, the entire recording has been brightened up, and it now sounds like it was recorded in a studio.<br />If you don't have a DVD-Audio player, you can still take advantage of this recording, as there is a 5.1 surround track which is playable on DVD-Video players that is very good, though not quite as clear and well=balanced as the 5.1 DVD-Audio track.  An additional benefit of the DVD-Audio version is a bonus track, &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, originally from ELP's first album.<br />In short, if you have a DVD player (audio or video-only), and you like Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, run, don't walk, to buy this DVD-Audio disk.
B000007T1M|5.0|Not so much, though.  I first heard of SOAD when &quot;Spiders&quot; was on the radio, and to tell you the truth I wasn't crazy about them.  It was a good song, but it was just missing something.  That something was what all other SOAD songs contain, uncontrollable rock!  This was kept on the album for the paying listeners to hear.  &quot;Sugar&quot; was my favorite song for awhile, until the cursed radio station wore it out.  However, there are many other songs on this CD that are well worth paying for.  The first half of the CD is awesome!  The second half pretty close.  This is the album you want to hear if you can't decide whether you like SOAD or not.  What can I say, this CD brings me up no matter how down I am, and I hope it does the same for you.
B00007K08H|5.0|Amelie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. There are so many little things that go along with the main story and that's what makes it so Interesting! I wish that there was more movies like that!
B00001SIES|2.0|I had heard of this group, and in fact I even heard a song by them once that I mistook for a Radiohead B-side.  There is no escaping the similarity between vocal styles.  <br />I never planned to purchase anything by Muse, but might consider buying some of their later work if the band develops its own style.  I came across this album at a record store that was giving away lots of CDs when you spent [$$].  I saw it in the free stuff bin, recognized the name, decided to pick it up without expecting to ever listen to it.  <br />I admit I was pleasantly surprised upon the first listen.  This band has potential.  I gave it only 2 stars because it isn't particularly original.  It reminds me of Pablo Honey, but without the inspired edginess and brilliant guitarwork.  And Pablo Honey isn't even that good of an album.  But Showbiz certainly doesn't [hurt].  In fact, the vocals even hinted at the emotion of Jeff Buckley.  Showbiz is worth a few listens, but if you're going to spend money on it, make sure it's at least half price.  Otherwise, stock up on Radiohead.
B000084T18|5.0|50 can flow. 50 signs with Dre and Shady. 50 almost goes platinum his first week on his debut CD. Get Rich... is one of the most brilliant records I've ever heard. Masterminds together collaborating on one disc? Can you get better than this? No surprise 50 raps about what the people wanna hear. His buzz is huge and he can do no wrong from now on. The duets with Shady are genius. Eminem is pound for pound the best rapper in the world, Dre invented G Funk...50 has a well paved road to ride his level 4 Cherokee down.  My guess is we get more personal with 50 on the next CD.
B00006G8O1|5.0|This movie is brilliantly suspenseful.  You will find yourself questioning the movie from beginning to end.  This is definitely the type of movie that you could watch over and over, and still want to see it again!
6305546789|5.0|There are certain movies that one cannot shake after viewing them.  There are reasons these movies stick with you for such a long time.  For a horror movie, the reasons are usually simple: they disturbed you, they gave you nightmares, or they just scared the living **** out of you.  John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" fits that discription almost perfectly.  No, the movie won't disturb you because it's not that type of film.  However, it will no doubt give you nightmares, and will give you the kind of paranoia that causes you to jump at your own shadow.  This is mainly because of John Carpenter's excellent directing.  In this low budget thriller, he doesn't rely on blood and guts to get the job done.  The tools he uses are suspense, fear, and paranoia.  He keeps the boogeyman Michael Myers, the first and ultimate slasher, in the shadows throughout the entire film.  He is always in the background, always watching and waiting, until he finally decides to strike.  And when he does it is big, loud, and scary as hell.  The film is riddled with this kind of suspense from the horrifying beginning, to the equally terrifying finale.
B000066NW0|4.0|It's hard to describe music, because it's so personal and all a matter of taste.  Avril's music is definitely worth buying the CD.  She has a strong voice, although not as mature as some others out there.<br />Also, if you play the CD on your computer or DVD player, you will be happily surprised.
079073804X|5.0|There are no words that can accurately describe the terror that \\"The Exorcist\\" emits.  Before viewing this film, I did not believe a movie could possibly be so horrifying.  However, after watching it for the first time, I thought differently.  Most everyone already knows the story: a twelve year old girl named Raegan is somehow posessed by an evil demon who claims to be the devil.  This demon causes the little girl to do terrible, murderous, revolting things so horrifying that the audience will most likely be disturbed for weeks.  This film doesn't rely on suspense, shadows, or split second shocks to terrify the audience (although those things are definately present).  The whole film is a bizarre roller coaster ride of extreme good vs. extreme evil, with an innocent twelve year old's life caught in the middle.  It is the horror that Raegan endures, as well as the struggle that the priest who attempts to exercise her goes through, that generate most of the films fear.  If you're looking for a good, solid scare, you should buy this immediately.  However, be warned: it will seriously mess you up for weeks.  I mean that as a good thing.

My favorite song would have to be &quot;Cell Block Tango&quot;.  I know every word and love to sing it (even though i cant sing lol.  The rest of the CD is great and can be listened to from start to finish without stopping.  Cathrine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, and Richard Gere do a wonderful job.  This is definetly worth buying.

B00006M183|4.0|Riot Act is Pearl Jam's most textured and mature album to date. I wouldn't say it's quite as good as Vitalogy or No Code, but i do think it's an improvement on Binaural and Yield. There is a great feeling of confidence with Riot Act, as every little experiment and gamble paid off. The album is strong from beginning to end with very few weak moments in between. 'Can't keep', one of my fav tracks, is a stunning dreamy opener which really sucks you in. Its followed by the fast pace rocker 'save you' and the soaring pop rock anthem 'loveboat captain'. Other standout tracks include the single 'I am mine', the awesome punk sounding 'green disease' and a superb matt cameron contribution 'You are', a dark groove laden love song which sounds like nothing PJ have dont before. As always Pearl Jam deliver the goods, and still manage to sound fresh after 12 years and hundreds of imitators.

My personal favorites on this collection are: Bohemian Rhapsody, Another One Bites the Dust, We Are the Champions, Who Wants to Live Forever, I'm Going Slightly Mad, The Invisible Man, and The Show Must Go On.  I recommend this set 100%!!!
B00004UEN8|5.0|This CD is recommended very highly. One of Pepper's very best records and a great study of one of the all time best rhythm sections. Nice to hear Miles' band without Miles, having to adapt on the spot to a new soloist.  The interplay is superb, as is the tune selection.  Standards and jazz classics.  Dig how they completely revitalize the old New Orleans standard &quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot;.<BR>Art's story about the making of this album doesn't quite mesh with his own discography.  He in fact had been making some records in the proceeding weeks and months. Art probably was also doing some serious 'goofing', so his memory may have failed him.  Plus his story made for better reading.  In any event, this is one of the great recordings in jazz history.
B00005JLSC|3.0|CHICAGO is a well-crafted and well-performed film, and individual numbers are nicely sung, danced, and choreographed. But I'm going to say something which will probably get me in hot water with just about everyone here, and that is that this isn't really a musical. Director Rob Marshall creates a good film, but he also contradicts the traditional musical form by presenting the numbers- save the opening and closing ones- as self-contained soliloquies which are figments of a lead character's imagination. Why did he do it this way? Because he didn't trust a modern-day audience to pay attention to a movie where characters sing or dance in a book's real-time context as a seamless advancement of the plot? (Even the stage version of CHICAGO allows the singing and dancing to go on uninterrupted.) It seems that modern-day filmmakers regard the musical genre as an out-of-date dinosaur which can only be presented to a modern public as a variation on MTV or VH-1. (The above summary makes the same observation, citing the excessive cuts which innterrupt the dance sequences.) Not all filmgoers are 14 years old; some of us want to see a song or dance performed from beginning to end without cutting back and forth to something else. Is this done because the filmmaker assumes we'd be bored to death watching three uninterrupted minutes of one song or dance? If so, don't knock it until you try it. (Obviously it worked in the films WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.) In the end, I congratulate the film for all its accolades and nominations, but it's a highly stylized music video more than a musical.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I thought this would be a great CD after hearing the singles, but I was wrong. It sounds just like more of that dull, repetitive modern rock. This CD has some good moments...like TM's solos and CC's vocals and lyrics on tracks 5,8....but this CD is dominated by a dull, blur of grungy, drawn out, SLOW wailing CC and a droning guitar. Its boring, its unoriginal and it all sounds pretty much the same.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|THis film has it all. And in particular the plot and story are wonderfully told. It may be overlooked by some but that would be shame, this is one for adults and children to enjoy. And the relationship between father and daughter is particularly poignant. A great gift for a father to give his daughter. I loved this film and have watched with my daughter over and over again....One of my all time disney favorites. and I have seen them all...
B00005O5CM|5.0|Elle Woods is shocked when, instead of proposing, her boyfriend dumps her.  Convinced that this was true love, she struggles to find a way to win Warner back.  In an effort to be perceived as serious, she follows him to Harvard Law School.  She soon finds that the work is much harder then she anticipated.  And Warner is already engaged to someone else.  Will she managed to fit in, or will she drop out and move back to California?<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a fairly formulaic comedy.  The first time I watched it, the plot only surprised me a couple of times.  However, it's so much fun, I really don't care.  Reese Witherspoon really caries the movie was Elle and brings such warmth to the part that it's easy to root for her to overcome her circumstances.  The other actors really shine as well, and several sub-plots help keep things interesting.  I find myself laughing and cheering my way through the movie.<br />This is a first rate DVD.  The picture and sound have been well preserved.  The audio commentaries are a mixed bag, some interesting information mixed in with a &quot;You were wonderful&quot; love fest.  My favorite feature is the deleted scenes.  They helped fill in a couple of small gaps.  And there's a great gag in one as well.  There was reference made on the disc to a few scenes that weren't included, which surprised me a little.  I guess these scenes were cut before they were filmed.<br />If you're looking for a lightweight, funny movie, this is for you.  It doesn't break any new ground, but you'll have so much fun getting to the end you really won't care.
B00005JK6I|4.0|The Shining (in my opinion) is a great movie based off a mediocre novel. I like Stephen King books a lot, but at times the book was boring and the finale was not as heart pounding as I was hoping it would be. The movie does not follow the book at all. The changes the movie made i think are good and work better than some of the things in the book. An axe is much scarier than a giant mallet. Moving hedge animals is just stupid and a hedge maze is dizzy and the final chase through it was brilliant. I liked how Wendy was weaker person in the movie because in the book Wendy was ready to take on Jack and she Knew what to do. But thats rediculous, anyone in a situation she was in would not act like that. The movie's Wendy is how a real person would act, ready to break down. This Wendy is freaking out and she has no idea what to do. The movie also has a claustrophobic atmosphere to it that's perfect. Stanley Kubrick is a genius and really fixed up a so-so novel. The acting in this movie was excellent. Jack Nicholson is perfect in his role as Jack Torrance. People say that he goes insane to fast in the movie. He seems crazy about a month into his stay at the Overlook Hotel. But to me he seems crazy right at the beginning of the movie. I think he's a man that was ready to flip long before he got to the Overlook. The hotel was just something to make him crack faster. People hate Shelley Duvall in this film and say she ruins, but she seems good in her role to me. She's much better than Rebecca De Mornay in that lousy remake. Danny LLoyd does a fine job for being such a little kid. Scatmen Crothers is good as the likable hotel cook. And Philip Stone is very creepy as Delbert Grady. This is a brilliant film that plays with your nerves at a leisurly pace. I know this kid who says the film is boring. I don't see how for I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time. I strongly suggest that anyone who has not seen The Shining should go out and rent it. You won't be dissapointed.
B00002ND77|5.0|Denzel Washington is amazing in this movie about the life of Malcom X.  This is also a movie that showcases Spike Lee's movie making talents.  It's obvious that he researched down to the last detail, from the clothes to the cars of the period and the slag and words that were used at the time, to make a movie that is totally realistic and grabs you right from the beginning.  The first time I saw this movie I was mesmerized, particularly because I had read Malcom's autobiography, and was shocked at how true to the book this movie actually is.  I commend Spike for making this movie, even though at the time there was controversey simply because of who Malcom was and what he represented.  People even to this day are afraid to even speak of him.  This movie encouraged me to learn more about Malcom X's life and beliefs.  I highly recommend it!
B000000H3W|5.0|The thrash era came to a close at the beginning of the 90's, with this album being perhaps that last true, classic thrash album released.  Fortunately, Sepultura ensured that thrash would go out with a bang.<br />Though I still consider this a classic thrash album, this isn't quite a fully traditional work. Sepultura is generally classified as death-thrash, as it is generally heavier and more frequently detuned and bottom heavy than straight thrash, with much harsher vocals as well.  Speaking of which, Max gives a truly killer performance here, full of rage and power with out overdoing it. He's particularly strong on the Motorhead cover, Orgasmatron.  Igor gives a rather straight forward, but still remarkably pummeling and impressive performance on the drums, which provides an outstanding base for the grinding but still lightning fast rhythm work. Surprisingly, despite the intensity and general lack of melody, the work here is frequently somewhat catchy, with most of the tracks having a memorable vocal line, which generally found in the chorus. Many excellent metal albums blur by with out leaving a real impression on the first listen. Not so for Arise. Not to imply that this is an overly simplistic and thus quickly forgotten work. Tracks like Desperate Cry and Altered State are lengthy and complex and demand attention.  Still this isn't, overall, nearly as complex as latter era Metallica or Death, which I feel can be a good thing, sometimes.  As much as enjoy the progressive elements, the straight-up raging intensity of tracks like Murder, Arise and Infected Voice is refreshing.  Aside from the aforementioned tracks there are still a number of medium length tracks which smoothly alternate from relatively slow, behemoth riffs to staccato Slayer-esque speed.  I haven't heard the original recordings, so I can't compare them, but the production here is nicely done.  No you can't here the bass much, and it isn't that clear, but the guitars have got tons of power,(Something missing from some later thrash) and the mix gives each part the prominence,(or relative lack of) that each deserves.<br />After the calm, atmospheric intro, the title track kicks in to a death-thrash fury which lets up.  This first track is one of the strongest on the album, with a simply devastating main riff, and the classic (and perfectly delivered) line, \\"Under a pale grey sky we shall arise.\\"<br />Dead Embryonic Cells is a slower, less thrashy but still brutally intense piece with a wealth of great riffage. Desperate cry is epic and devastating with some nice leads and good, (but minimal) use of acoustics. Murder is a return to the straight-up thrash of the title track, with some great results.  Subtraction is another standout, with a fantastic chorus. The next 3 tracks are the closest this album comes to having filler. (This album simply doesn't have any filler.) Each of them is well written and enjoyable, but they don't stand out like the other songs.  The original tracks close with the fantastic Infected Voice. This is my personal favorite from this album.  It's short and sweet, and Max's shouting  \\"Infected Voice!!\\" over the synchronized guitars at the end of the chorus is just about the most memorable moment I've ever heard on a metal album.  This song is simply the epitome of thrash metal. (That doesn't mean it's the greatest thrash song ever; it isn't, but I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about.)<br />The Bonus tracks are of greater worth than they are on most albums.  Despite there being 4 bonus tracks there are only really 2 new songs. The Motorhead cover is outstanding, and the original, C.I.U. is nicely done, even if it isn't as strong as the material originally released.<br />All in all, this is an outstanding and essential metal album.

1577311523|1.0|PLEASE!... stop with the the \\"twenty dollar\\" words and the soft whispery presentation.When describing the eastern approach, us westerners NEED SOMETHING WE CAN SINK OUR TEETH INTO. Tolle is like a myriad of authors, with his inability to make this material practical. Sure the message is there, but am I going to be able to USE this information in the office tommorow? (no!).There are so many others that convey these concepts so seamlessly......\\"Full Catastrophe Living\\" by Zinn or \\"Mindfullness in Plain English\\" by Gunaratana or \\"Wherever You Go There You Are\\" also by Zinn; Levine's \\"The Positive Psychology Of Buddhism And Yoga\\". This list can go on. The point is, these authors give you practical exercises to live in the present, maintaining much more depth and balance in your life.I was caught by the hype of this book...do you think Amazon would take a return with the first one third of the book with some yellow highlighting? (which tells you... I did give the ole \\"self-help reader\\" try).I guess if this was your first look at these concepts it would be profound, for me , I'm done with the FLUFFY stuff.
B00005JLEU|1.0|we saw this movie with several other parents and the kids found it scary. the movie on the whole was mean spirited. the parents yell at their daughter before being turned into to pigs and she is entered into slavedom and must save her parents and everyone is mean, ugly and nasty to each other. hardly a happy family movie. Maybe ok for adults although it was not my cup of tea but I certainly would not recommend it for kids. everyone was complaining about as they left the theater. I'll stick with monsters, inc., ice age, shrek, spirit are all better family fare.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Jason Bourne wakes up adrift at sea with no memory of who he is, how he got there, or why he has two bullets in his back.  As he follows the few meager clues he has to find his identity, he attracts the attention of someone or someones who want to kill him.  Yet he seems to already possess the knowledge needed to stay alive.  Can he outwit his opponents to find his missing memory?<br />This movie came highly recommended to me, so I couldn't wait to see it.  I was drawn in from the beginning and the action sequences had me on the edge of my seat.  I was also intrigued to find out what was really going on.  However, as the movie progressed, I began to get very disillusioned with it.  Jason keeps making mistakes that I knew better then to make.  And, sure enough, they get him in more trouble.  For a character that was established from the beginning as a smart spy, this really bothered me.<br />If you're willing to forgive plot holes, there are some wonderful action sequences here to enjoy.  Otherwise, skip this movie in favor of something where the plot makes a little more sense.
B0000399WI|4.0|This was a very well-done film about friendship and persistence. I won't waste anyone's time retreading through the plot, but there are some wonderful touches. <br />Overall, with the exception of some beatings, this film made prison life seem alright (or at least Prison life in 1940-s through 1960s Maine). <br />Parts of the film were a bit slow, and the Red's (Morgan Freeman) narration was overdone. Makes me want to go to prison and see what I am missing.
0440237688|4.0|I love the 'Giver'.  I've read it as a child and as a teen, and i think the way it presents the neccesity of \\"memories\\" and the crime of \\"Sameness\\" is really unique.  It can be enjoyed on so many levels, whether you want a simple \\"coming of age\\" story, or a deeper, metaphorical journey, this book has it.  That's why it's great to re-read.  Let yourself examine the 'Giver' on multiple levels and discover new things.
0140386335|5.0|This sweeping tale of love lost and love found, while not never ending, is very good. It  is very long, but the quality of the thing justifies it. That's what I'm talking about. The quality of the thing. The quality! The quality of the thing!
B000069AUI|5.0|i bought this album in mid Oct 2002 on the recommendation of a friend who had bought Parachutes.  I am usually an R&amp;B and hiphop person but i always appreciate good music and I instantly fell for God Put a Smile, Clocks and Daylight.  Then I fixated on Whisper (which a lot of people hate but I think its great).  Now I am in love with Warning Sign, the title track and Amsterdam. the only songs i have yet to fall for are the two that everyone else seem to love, In My Place and The Scientist. So if an album can be all those things at once it must be good.<br />its amazing how things have taken off for them. I hadnt heard of them when i bought the album, now they are grammy nominated, Chris Martin has dated and broken up with Gwenyth Paltrow, they have been on several night talk shows, and HBO has used both Clocks and Rush of Blood to the head on commercials and TV shows.  This album has wooed me away from hiphop and i might not go back.
B00003CXXM|3.0|this movie follows an interesting plot as an amnesiac discovers his super-spy abilities and why. The film is a little slow paced for the typical action thriller but still a nice performance by Matt Damon in a enjoyable movie.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|From what I understand, Kino's theatrical version of the film was projected at 24fps and they decided to keep it that way for their DVD release. Furthermore, many sources on the web claim that the ORIGINAL theatrical release in 1927 was shown at speeds of 24-28fps.
1573229725|5.0|I just started this book today and I can't put it down.  I can't believe I am rooting for the young heroine who is on her way to a country home to defraud another young woman.  Everyone in the book so far is crooked--it will remind you immediately of Dickens.  It is very well-crafted.  Here is one of my favorite lines so far:  &quot;When Dainty heard that she pulled the pins from her hair and threw them at the fire.  Some had hair still clinging to them and the flames set it hissing.&quot;  Can't you just hear it?  I plan to continue reading this book tonight until I can't keep my eyes open any more.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Personally Smallville is the best show aired on television. Sometimes the topics are a little too old for me but I think the charactors are a perfect portrayal of the original charactors. I can't wait untill the DVD comes out... gotta have it!!
0385335482|5.0|what an amazing book! It's soooooo good and rich as well. it's very hard to put down. I'm reading it for a 2nd time right now actually! I even went as far as to travel to England and go to all the stores in the book! Read this! It's fantastic
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Well, all I can say about this edition is &quot;WOW&quot;!  So the years haven't been kind to this movie, and about 1/4 of it is irretrievably &quot;lost&quot;.  I think it still stands out as a silent masterpiece. There are added intertitles, and in the extras, which are plentiful, you have access to some still photographs of missing scenes which help to better understand some of the subplots.  Picture quality is outstanding, and the musical score fits perfectly.  By all means, well worth the price and a worthy addition to any DVD collection. Good job, KINO!
B00003CX8V|4.0|Sometimes you hear about a film that is so good, you feel jealous because you have not seen it, or just want to be a bad boy and refuse to see it because you're afraid you might learn something.  Well, I finally saw, The Apartment, and yes it is good.<br />  Perhaps this was the film that made people like Jack Lemmon.  Nice guys do win.  In my opinion, this film is about The Nice Guy vs. macho work men. Guess who wins?<br />  Jack Lemmon plays a single man who just prefers to work day and night and he has his own apartment with the comfort of music and his television set.  However, in order to keep his desk job, he is forced to let the macho executives use his apartment for their own pleasure with their dates and marital affairs.  So out in the cold Jack goes, literally.<br />  The next morning, Jack has a cold.  But on to work he goes.  He begins to openly talk with an elevator lady (Shirley MacLaine) who he really never talked too much before. From then on, whenever they see each other, it's only cordial.  Just two people staying business-like and professional at work.  Then something tragic happens that eventually changes his life and others around him.  I think this film holds up very well and is still realistic, even in today's modern world.  Keep watching this film to the very end.  There are a few surprises and twists.  So don't give up to early.  After the film is over, I guarantee it will keep you thinking.
B00005JKZT|5.0|saw it on valentine's day. for the second time... decided that i really, really and i mean, <i>really</i> love this movie.<br />forget what i complained on my first review. this is just a damn good movie.<br />have decided that i can live with the \\"artistic liberties\\" jackson took with this movie. i mean, i guess i can live with the fact that movie-faramir is just totally different from book-faramir... i may not like it, but i can swallow that.<br />good gawd, i have to say that i <i>absolutely love</i> the fighting scenes in this one. man, it blew my mind away!!! it was just totally crazy and beautiful at the same time... i'm speechless really...<br />one of the best entrances yet has to be when gandalf and eomer arrived on the eastern side of the mountain on the fifth morning. stunning and breathtaking. gawd i love the scene where the riders descend from that frigging steep mountain side... *looks like stunned fish* just amazing...<br />and yes, this is definitely a movie for a girls' night out (or even v-day for singles like moi)... come on, there's like, what? nearly a half dozen of exceedingly beautiful male main characters? not to mention tons of other good enough to eat extras thrown in for good measure. you gotta be kidding me if that is not a good enough reason for girls to go see it... *grin*<br />but heck, this is way beyond anything i've seen before. and it's a darn good movie too. kudos to jackson for not letting down the hopes of the legions of fans... good news is that LotR: the return of the king promises to be even better.<br />the bad news is we have to wait for a freaking year for that one... i'm counting the days, man...
B00004RFFS|5.0|This is one of the best vampire movies ever made besides BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA. I really liked it, and the story kept me interested. I cannot remember one dull moment. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances, and so does everyone else, including the absolutley wonderful debut from Kirsten Dunst! This was also a very creepy movie with a freaky atmosphere, and lots of it gave me cold chills. Great movie from Neil Jordan. The score is excellent, too. The ending is one of the best that I've seen in a while!<br />This one is recommended for older audiences, due to graphic violence and two scenes of nudity.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary provides its audience with a balance of life's issues. This witty portrayal of a scarred girl's journey to self-actualization should be a number one choice for the open-minded movie buff. Reality... sex isn't just white cotton sheets and candle light. For some sex requires more maintenance. Reality... when life hands you a lemon, most don't make lemonade. Some take drastic measures to release their pain, whether safe or not. If you are ready to step out of the box, watch Secretary to enlighten you.
6301640659|4.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR ADULTS ONLY!  In the rape scene there are two quick subliminal shots after the killer with mirror glasses say \\"You made me do that!\\".  They are of the killer's genital penetrating the victim in an act of rape.  You can only see this when you \\"pause\\" and \\"step\\" or \\"frame by frame\\" the scene on your VCR.  Definately \\"X\\"-Rated material.  In the third killing, in the adult movie room, immediately when you see the knife enter the victim's blue jacket covered back, is another quick subliminal shot of a genital penetrating the victim.
B00005JKNC|2.0|An annoying nagging doubt falls over the viewer for what is an inconsistent attempt to bridge feel good glory days Hollywood with a current edge. A comic book feel in lighting and script does a good cast  no good. Give Jim Carrey credit for at least attempting to carry it off. He lacks the chops to pull off the still love em after this mess panache that a stronger lead would merit ( see Harrison Ford in 6 days /7 nights)<br />Landau is great in a flawed script that cannot decide between whimsical and thoughtful. Less herocially inclined set and lighting would have given scripted bromides a chance, but the back lite perfect close ups lost any dramatic edge and script problems glare brighter. Entire sub plot and resolution collaspe given heavy handed treatment. When will we be spared the court room style resolution in the last ten minutes? Not only old ground , but use of a prop that I found offensive in context since only provided to lend emotional heft to banalities of the lines provided. Heros good, mean Senators bad<br />BUT, not without redemming features that warrant the second star. Landau and supporting cast strong , pretty if very back lot 1940's , but not worth a re-view . Invest your dollars and time elsewhere
1577311523|5.0|The wonderful thing about this book (and other books dealing with consciousness) is that its teachings can be verified through self-observation. Once this happens, the material is truly understood - not because it has been read, but because it has been lived. We are all addicted to our thoughts. We like playing the same fantasies over and over in our heads, wasting our mental resources. This truly is unfortunate, as it prevents us from experiencing the world around us. Practicing the techniques in this book will give you a solid anchor in the real world. Paradoxically, some of the information in this book may seem a little \\"out there\\" if it's not fully understood/experienced. I assure you, though, that there is very little in his book that can't be proven through self-observation. Anyone claiming that these teachings are BS simply hasn't observed themselves, or refuses to out of mind/ego attachment.<br />This book teaches you how to become conscious. This is a surprisingly simple concept that the average intelligent person will be able to fully grasp within the first fifty pages. Once your consiousness is in control, you will have tremendous mental focus and clarity. Remember, you are not learning how to enter some abstract/mystical state of consiousness; you are learning how to PAY ATTENTION to yourself and the world around you. Of course, this is quite mystical compared to what we think we know as \\"paying attention\\", which is really just pathetically blinking in and out of consiousness for a few seconds before retreating back to the worries, fantasies, and false comforts of the self-condemned ego-mind.
0312305060|5.0|I decided to read the book before seeing the movie...at first it was difficult to get into.  The long, descriptive sentence structure took some time to get used to - however within a few pages these sentences become poetic and melodic.  As I read the book, I pictured Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore as the main characters.  The story is wonderfully moving, thought provoking and so insightful.  I loved how one chapter is devoted to each of the main characters - shifting from Virgina Woolf, to Mrs Brown and then to Mrs. Dalloway.  Cunningham is able to write in such a way that the transition from one character and time period to the next is seamless.  The ending (and I won't give it away as others have) is such a shock and so moving.  I can't wait to see the movie - however I don't think the movie can begin to do justice to this masterpiece of literature.<BR>I highly recommend the book!

0425074811|1.0|Von Daniken's theory about ancient astronauts visiting earth is nothing more than psuedoscience.  As with many psuedosciences, his ideas sound somewhat convincing, especially to someone without a scientific background.  But the &quot;evidence&quot; does not hold up until critical inquiry.
B00005OC0G|4.0|Unlike the rave by the first reviewer and the pans by the next two reviewers, I found things to like and others to bemoan about this performance. It won't replace other favorite recordings such as Menuhin/Furtw&auml;ngler, Hahn/Zinman, Heifetz/Munch (all available at amazon.com), but it is, in my opinion, better than Perlman/Giulini, which pits Perlman's juicy romanticism against Giulini's drier analytical approach. There is no question that Mutter and Masur are more than a little underpowered in the first movement (although the Kreisler cadenza is humdinger as played by Mutter) but there are subtleties, too. The attention to line and its organic growth in the early moments of the concerto is an example but this gets lost about ten minutes into the movement when it begins to lose its focus. The second movement is serenely played and for me that's just fine. In the last movement things really cut loose and it's a delight; Mutter makes the umpteen repetitions of the rondo theme slightly different each time around. I also liked the second of the Romances a lot.<br />So I guess I come down somewhere in between the previous reviewers. This would not be my choice for an only recording, but I'm glad I own it.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Listening to this album will take you to the land of constant repetition, with only 3 minutes per song as a proof of how mainstream can Shakira be only to acomplish the music label and regular fans.<BR>Colombia's poorest pseudrock star comes again with a simple cd full of musical inconsistencies such this 13 tracks, most of all in english (9), in a way to overcome her personal style and to explore the american market. Of course she coudn't make neither.<br />Shakira's Laundry Service is completely a Brainwash Service, the entire album is like a child book to learn how to read, with mediocre lyrics only to prove her lack of inspiration. Only the good job of Ted Jensen's Sterling Sound in New York could save, in sound, the bad music.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah has gracefully walked in and has quietly taken center stage! Music will never be the same again. &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; is an outstanding piece of work. I wanted to thoroughly experience this CD before commenting about it. I've had it since June 2002, and I must say, never have I been so mystified and fascinated with a singer, as I am with Norah Jones. Her music is pure and simple; yet alluring enough to capture you. I was shopping one day and the store had Norah's, &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; video playing. I was immediately captivated by her voice. I said, &quot;Ooh, who is that?&quot; Her songs evoke feelings that arise from the depths of ones soul; the way she hugs that microphone makes her &quot;unique sound&quot; even more breathtaking. Her singing is clear enough to hear each word. I listen to her lovely, smoky voice everyday. She's just adorable, and with all the hoop-la surrounding her, she remains so serene and unaffected by it all. I predict several Grammy's for this lady! <br />She also has a great band. They all mix very well. I love the way Lee handles that bass on, &quot;Cold, Cold, Heart.&quot; All of the songs are lovely, it's not everyday you find a CD with the entire selection of songs, all sounding so magnificent. <br />Her music videos are splendidly directed; the layouts are perfect for her to display that unique &quot;smoothness.&quot; With the world in such chaos, we need a voice  like hers to calm us all. Norah is up there with some of the greatest singers of all time. She's truly something to behold!

B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has once again pleasantly graced us with vibratic melodies of love and captured my attention.  Parachutes was a beautiful album, and there is no better way to follow up a debut album than with one of such brilliance as A Rush of Blood to the Head.  I have not removed this album from my CD changer in my car since I put it there when I first bought it, and like a great movie, I notice more things I love about it every time I hear it.  My favs...Green eyes and Amsterdam.

B00000F14B|5.0|How can you top something like this?  This movie musical is as close to perfection as it gets.  Perfectly cast, marvellously directed and filmed, beautiful music magnificiently arranged, The Music Man sets the standard for all movie musicals, even though it was the last big musical filmed in that era.  Meredith Willson's brilliant musical wit and talent reached their pinnacle in this musical.  Considered by many to be the best musical ever written, this filmed version is worthy of the musical itself and leaves nothing to be desired.<br />This DVD release is equally marvellous.  A fitting tribute to one of Hollywood's finest efforts of all times.  The Music Man is one of the movie industry's brightest stars, and this DVD edition will be a prized possession in any movie collection.  Even if you &quot;don't know one note from another,&quot; you'll love this spirited romp through 1912 small-town Iowa, and through some of the best music ever written for the stage or screen.  The transfer to DVD is excellent.  Vivid colors, sharp images, beautifully remastered soundtrack, the whole package is excellent.  <br />The extras on the disc are also great, including a 30-minute special on the making of the musical and the movie, narrated by Shirley Jones and with comments by Buddy Hackett, Onna White (the choreographer), and Susan Luckey (Zaneeta Shinn).  <br />This DVD is one of my most prized possessions.  My only complaint is I wish Warner Brothers would package it in a better-grade all-plastic case rather than the cardboard snap case.  It won't hold up over time as well, and this baby will be in my collection for a very long time!
B00003OSSL|2.0|This is a movie that you can invite your friends over and make fun.  I am a HUGE Harrison Ford fan, but he looked ridiculous in this movie.  He definitely was not ready for his close up - There is a close up of him that will make you cringe (earring, dyed hair and all), for he looks every bit his 60-something age. - playing a top cop no less.  Kristen Scott Thomas seemed to be in another movie, slipping in and out of an English accent.  The music was shockingly dopey.  There was NO chemistry between them.  The plot and subplot tedious. Need I go on! View for the giggles.  Gave two stars for this reason alone.
B000066NW0|5.0|I do not like the new teenage pop queens, but heard Avril perform &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; on a TV show, and liked her music.  The first time I heard &quot;I'm With You&quot;, I almost immediately bought this album.  I have never regretted it.  This is a terrific album, and Avril has one of the best voices in popular music today.  She blows the rest away!  I highly recommend this album.

B00005NOOH|5.0|I gave my husband this set for Christmas 2002.  Being of a certain age, we both had seen this series on television.  It's a privilege now to own it.<br />Twenty-six hour-long episodes, each covering a distinct aspect of WW-II, of both the European and Pacific theatres.  For students of documentary film making, the Introduction alone is worth the price.  It's an entire course, all in the space of one hour.<br />The series begins with a visit to the ruins of the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, 16 miles NW of Limoges, where in June 1944 the entire population (men, women and children) were rounded up and gunned down.  The Nazi soldiers then torched and bombarded the village.  After the war, Charles de Gaulle ordered that the destroyed village be maintained as it stood. And it remains to this day.<br />Along with Laurence Olivier as narrator, the BBC team interspersed actual footage with interviews of witnesses who related their personal experiences of the war.<br />Overall, very powerful and very thorough, as one might expect from the BBC.  If you want to understand the history of WW-II, this one is worth raiding the piggy bank to buy.
B00007JVBI|4.0|This album is worth it, if for nothing else, for the third track &quot;good woman&quot;.  It begins with one of Chan's familiar signature chord patterns, but then comes alive with Warren Ellis's violin (Dirty Three).  By the end of the track the female back-up vocals along with Eddie Vedder (!) take on the power of a full choir.  Absolutley amazing.  The rest of the album is a blend of 'rocking' harsh songs like earlier Cat Power and slow, spare ballads like those found on the &quot;Covers&quot; record.  Essential for fans, and track 3 (&quot;good woman&quot;) is essential for anyone who appreciates heartachingly beautiful music.

B000069AUI|5.0|A rush of blood to the head is simply the best album Ive heard in years no filler just killer. The title track and warning sign are my favorites on the album but to me no weak stuff on here and Im looking forward to their next album.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Great movie!  Matt Damon is very good in this part.  Would recommend this movie to anyone
B0000013GT|5.0|This album is Outkast at its finest moment.  This album came out in 96, however, it was so ahead of its time that if you listened to it today, you would not even notice that it is 7 years old.  The beats are futuristic even for todays standards, and the lyrics are extremly thought provoking and hard hitting just like Camacho and Vargas.  I must admit that I am not a fan of Southern hip hop, however, with Outkast and the Goodie Mob I must make an exception.  I believe this album is underrated and should not be missed by anyone.  It is almost a shame that I found this in a 10 dollar bargain bin at Virgin Records.
B000084T18|5.0|this is the tightest cd to come out well since Blueprint 2
B00003CXXM|4.0|This is not a superb film in the sense that it is not one of the films that stays with you for a lifetime and gives you a totally new experience. No. You have seen many movies of the same sort and yet, this movie is very good of its kind and extremely enjoyable. The movie moves in a fast pace and there is no dull moment. Matt Daemon portrays Jason Bourne - a young man trying to search his identity after being found at sea with nothing but two bullets in his back and a capsule containing bank details in his leg. He is surprised to discover certain &quot;survival&quot; abilities in himself and a lot of hostile reactions - all seem like pieces of a puzzle he has to build up. Jason Bourne starts his long journey to find who he is accompanied by a girl he meets along the way. Although the part could have easily been made up to be a typical &quot;macho&quot; role Matt Daemon is able to convey the confusion of Jason Bourne struggling to find his identity and is both charming and fragile. Franke Potante is adorable with her slight accent and the European scenery is indeed a change and gives the movie a somewhat &quot;refined&quot; and even &quot;sophisticated&quot; touch. The movie is not too violent and the romance between the couple is quite convincing. I fell in love with both of them in the hotel hair cutting scene. Reading the previous reviews I agree that not all is logical in this movie, but spy business always seem a bit of science fiction to me and I am willing to &quot;suspend my disbelief&quot; for the pure enjoyment which I received.
B00008DDXB|5.0|I whole hearted agree, the Harry Potter books can not compare with the movies, BUT!!!, yes, there is always a but!! <br />As an educator, I have seen so much resistance to reading in these days of competition,  with TV, computer games, and all the problems with life in general_____if a child or adult sees one of the Harry Movies and is inspired enough to pick up one of the books____ I say \\"BRAVO\\" <br />The movie has done it's job, it has opened up someone eyes to written knowledge of the world!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Smooth, settling, and just plain relaxing.  Sit back and enjoy this great new artist.  She has the potential to do anything.  She plays the music wonderfully and sings straight from the soul, bounces off her heart and out her mouth.  Why, you ask, did I not give her 5 stars.  No one is perfect, yet.
0871137380|5.0|Do you like REAL MILITARY books that tell the truth about what really happened? Then you should read BLACK HAWK DOWN. There is so much information and it's all accurate. The book is so graphic and loaded with details. ... Mark Bowden recognizes the Battle of the Black Sea which is the most forgotten battle by most Americans.  He honors the American soldiers who lost their lives on that tragic Octyober day in Somalia.  About 100 American soldiers were dropped in to the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia in order to take out two top Lieutenants of a Somali warlord, Mohamed Adid and to return to base on a Sunday afternoon while driving on the beach.  The mission was supposed to take a hour.  Instead they were pinned down into the city fighting thousands of heavily armed Somalis all day and night.  On the following morning, 18 American soliders were dead, with four Black Hawk Helicopters down.  This is a once in a life time book that is truly extraorgdinary and amazing !...
B00005JLS0|4.0|I think this film was hillarious. I liked it when Sandra got stuck on Hugh's belt, When they were trying out the bed and when sandra walks in on them playing strip cheast. I though it was soooo sad when they were in the hellicopter and i was just like tell each other how you feel. But it is just like most of the other romantic films...<BR>       Hugh Grant looks very nice again and Sandra was very pretty in her dress.<BR>So over all good movie, but it could have been more original.
0618001905|5.0|Well written, powerful...Hochschild successfully weaves a story of historic proportions, sacrificing nothing to communicate the true destruction of the Congolese people under King Leopold and Belgium.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This is a modern take on the Gladiator movie.  A Roman general, Maximus, has loyally served on the German front.  When a new and jealous Caesar, Commodus, ascends the throne, he orders Maximus and his family killed.  Maximus excapes and ends up in a provincial arena as a gladiator slave.  When Commodus decides to have a season of games in the Colliseum, Maximus's troupe travels to Rome and he searches for a way to avenge his family's death.  <br />This is a typical story in terms of epic filmaking, and this film is most definitely an epic.  From the Private Ryan-esque battle at the German front (featuring 1000 extras, flaming arrows, and mud!) to the CGI-generated recreation of the Colliseum, it's a treat to watch and soak in the atmosphere.  The performances are uniformly good - Crowe was probably better in the Insider, but won his Oscar here as Maximus.  It's a good thing Crowe can sustain interest, as he's onscreen something like 85% of the time!  The supporting performances are also good.<br />This is a typical Ridley Scott film.  He almost blows it with a couple of (as it turns out) non-fatal errors.  The first is that the entire film (155 minutes!) is on the same level of intensity.  Any mood for 2.5 hours is tough to take, but the oppressive sombreness of Gladiator is particularly dangerous.  However, the gladitorial spectacles are sufficiently diverse to break it up.  More annoying is the uniform drabness of the film.  The colours are completely washed out greys and browns.  This was done to match up the CGI (not quite up to the challenge in 1999), but the overall look is dull!  Oddly, parts of the soundtrack then clash with the visuals because the music is too bright.  The CGI is generally non-obtrusive (except when showing large crowds), so I can forgive this problem as well.<br />The DVD extras are quite nice, especially the hour-long documentary on gladitorial games.  It's no surprise that the \\"real\\" characters in the film, such as Commodus, are not accurately portrayed, but does lend credence to the general accuracy of the situations - they may not have happened as filmed, but COULD have.  There are cut scenes, the commentary by Scott and others is interesting, so the DVD is well worth getting.

B000088E6D|5.0|Micheal Buble is definately a wonder to behold.  He has such a mature voice for such a young man and his voice like fine wine can only get better with age.  Anyone that is a fan of the rat pack and that great 30's and 40's sound will love this album.  I thought I would never say it but, move over Frank there is a new kid in town.
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" is the best CD yet from Christina.  The vocals, song styles, and emotions really show her true talent. Very uplifting lyrics. Ranging from blues to contemporary and even a 60's style rocker, this is  incredibly, enjoyable listening material.
B00005YJMX|5.0|....yes, better than the original, much better than the Hammer films, better than Lugosi's version, and WAY better than Coppola's watered-down love story...this is the gothic vampire film to rule them all.<br />One of Werner Herzog's and Klaus Kinski's greatest collaborations.  Fitzcarraldo is also highly recommended.
B0000203YT|4.0|shakespeare in love is a nice romantic movie, that should be watched with some girls and a lot of chocolate, for it is really sentimental. It also teaches you some facts about shakespeares time and maybe some people who like the language shakespeare uses will start to read romeo and juliet after watching this movie.<BR>the actors performed very well.
B000002897|5.0|When I'm with my music geek friends talking music, and the topic is &quot;What is a perfect album?&quot;, Sweet Oblivion is my go-to example.  Flawless from the very first second, it's the kind of record that makes you sit and listen; the kind of record that makes you sit in silence after it's done, refusing to put another album in the stereo cause there's such a slim chance another album is going to measure up.<br />Have an opinion about the Grunge era and Grunge sound with which these fellas are associated?  Forget it. The Trees may be of that to a degree, but the heart of Sweet Oblivion is songwriting.  These songs would sound good regardless of style or scene.<br />And it's cohesive, ok?  The first song sets a mood and it's sustained throughout; Sweet Oblivion hits it's highs with some raved-up rockers, mellows with a couple ballads, hits a bunch of notes in-between...but all the while, there's a common sound; a singular vision created by a band that was clearly at it's peak.  No one will ever again sound the way the Sweet Oblivion-era Screaming Trees did (not even the Trees themselves...).<br />But I'm being kinda too earnest and somber here...I don't want anyone to get the idea that I'm calling this Art, that it is Important.  There are no lyrical epiphanies being dropped, no new Guitar Gods or Ace Drummers being born, and it's no Pet Sounds-caliber production miracle...it's just a damn fine rock'n'roll record.  Tuneful, emotional, rocking, and good from start to finish.  How often does that happen?<br />That last point cannot be stressed enough.  Others here have already said this, but I'll happily reiterate it: every song on Sweet Oblivion is a great song.<br />Yeah, this is a good one.
B000000H6D|4.0|Bloody Kisses is definitely a record that won't please every rock music fan. The Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Godsmack, etc crowd of today's \\"metal\\" won't like this one at all and find it grating and annoying. Fans of actual good metal music like that of Pantera, White Zombie, Metallica, Opeth, etc will love this one.<br />The album opens great with Corpus Christi, an amazing song which alone warrents the price of purchase. I guarantee you won't get bored of it any time soon. Most of the other songs on the record are good, with maybe 2 or so that aren't that worthy of listening to. \\"Too Late\\" is also a great song with a bridge after the second chorus that could've been a little better and not so long. The remake of \\"Summer Breeze\\" is cool and also kind of funny to listen to when you imagine how the original version sounded like. The rest are songs you really have to listen to a few times to really get into, but after you do, you'll appreciate the fact that you bought this record.<br />Overall, this is definitely a worthy entry into you music collection if you're into good metal. Although if you're just getting into these guys, I'd suggest Either October Rust or World Coming down as opening records.
B000084T18|4.0|This album is good, but not the best thing ever.  The people who think that 50 cent is better then Eminem are very screwed up.  I dont think that 50 cent has the rapping skills or the music to ever be better than eminem.  In Da Club and 21 questions are the only truly great songs on this album.  I do recommend this album.  When compared to Ja Rule, Jay z, and Nelly this is a work of art.  When compared to Eminem, Tupac, or Nas this is just another THUG album.  But it is worth the money
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is my favorite band of all time! Parachutes will get you started on the greatness that is Coldplay! But start here first. Then move onto the masterpiece &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;. That one will make you a fan. Check them out on tour! They rock!
B000002I2I|5.0|And you shall not be disppointed. . . This is the Doors' first excursion into the Blues (before \\"L.A. Woman,\\" of course, their great venture into the Blues which would be their last studio album). . . nevertheless, they were dipping all of their limbs (and their Achilles tendons, if you will) into the Blues with this album, and they did so magnificently. . . \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is an incredible glimpse into what the Doors were hoping to accomplish after their earlier (and must I say pretty \\"user-friendly\\") albums. . . All of The Doors albums are original and magnificent, but I must proclaim that this is the one album that \\"cracks the ice,\\" so to speak. . . Morrisson has never sounded so, well, alive, as on this album. . . That gusto, that verve, that passion, which us great Doors fans expect of the band, is resplendent on this album.. . .It matters not whether or not all the musicians were getting along wonderfully during the making of this album (and all Doors fans know quite well that all band members had their \\"differences\\" during this recording), for the ultimate sound which permeates this album is one of utter genius, originality, and, well, that unique sound which can only be that of The Doors.. . . I just hope that our parents remember and relish their sound, as much as we relatively-Doors-neophytes do. . . I \\"discvored \\"The Doors\\" during my sophomore year in high school (1995), and hope that the newer generations are doing the same. . . ah, what not young bard can not feel compelled to The Doors' music?! We all know that the Doors' oeuvre is outstanding indeed, but this is truly one of their best albums.. . . It kicks off with the well-known \\"Road House Blues\\" (what a remedy for the \\"Blues,\\" to awaken with a reminder, that \\"the future's always uncertain, and the end is always near,\\"), and concludes with the Bluesy \\"Maggie M'Gill\\" (well, when all else fails, you can always go out and \\"buy yourself a brand new pair of shoes\\". . . This is a statement to which mostwomen will surely relate. . .But my favorite song is most definitely \\"Indian Summer,\\" an exquisite and sentimental ballad about love and love aand love lost. . .This song is so simplistically gorgeous, that it pulls on your heart-strings. . . \\"I love you the best/better than all the rest/ that I meet in the summmer/the Indian Summer. . .\\" Yet all songs on \\"Morrison Hotel\\" are guaranteed to charm; \\"Peace Frog\\" and \\"Blue Sunday\\" stand out on this album, as well. . . Morrison's vocals never fail, and neither does any of the music on this exquisite album.. . . As I said before, book a room at \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" and you will be far from far from disappointed. . . How could anyone feel disappointed? This is indeed a masterpiece, and should not be disregarded. . . \\"Land Ho!\\" Enjoy, yes do so, and join the \\"ship of fools\\"! Or else, you can find your true love \\"on a blue Sunday\\". . . Or else, if you can't identify with any allusions to this album, at least you'll be able to dig the music and lyrics in all their mystique and beauty. . . and I have to say, that not much is capable of competing with the simplistic beauy of \\"Indian Summer\\". . .give the song a few listens, and you'll see what I mean. . . Really, this song can touch even the most frozen of hearts. . . \\"Morrison Hotel\\": an ouststanding album, indeed.. . . hope you agree!:)
B00008DDXB|2.0|I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter books, but they shouldn't have made movies based on the books. The first movie was absolutely terrible. Chamber of Secrets was my favorite book out of the first four, but they slaughtered it in this movie. The beginning was okay (Dobby is adorable!) but as soon as Harry got to school, the movie took a turn for the worse.<BR>   <BR>They messed up the sequence of events from the time Harry found the cat, Mrs. Norris, hanging from the wall to the time Harry goes to see the spider, Aragon. It would've been much better if they followed the book. <BR>   <BR>Also, in the book, it told A LOT more about Ron's little sister Ginny. In the movie it seemed mysterious that Ginny would do such a thing since you know almost nothing about her.<BR>   <BR>The last big mess-up was in the chamber scene.The chamber seemed too \\"perfect.\\" It seemed to me that J.K. Rowling described the chamber much different than it was in the movie. <BR>   <BR>I found two good points among the many bad things. Number 1: they've got an excellent actor playing Harry's enemy, Professor Snape. Number 2: the movie has wonderful, enchanting music. But, that's what soundtracks are for.       <BR>   <BR>So, it wasn't the best movie. (But the soundtrack is probably good)
6305095442|5.0|The film is a cinematic masterpiece, it's so funny, scary, violent, and soundtrack is so sweet! This first one is the scariest, but the sequel is far funnier. It has some scares in it, but this has a lot of humor in it. It's dark humor, but it is funny. This is not as good as Army of Darkness though. Army of Darkness is the funniest in the series. See the first one, then this one, and also check out Army of Darkness.

006051048X|4.0|Coraline Jones has recently moved into a new flat with her parents. Above her lives a \\"crazy old man\\" who is training a mice circus and below her live two former theatre stars, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible who have several small dogs and read tea leaves. Coraline is dealing with summer boredom by exploring her new home as her parents are busy with their own lives during the day. One day, she finds a door in the parlor (saved for \\"best\\" as her mother says) that goes nowhere - a brick wall is all that faces her when her mother unlocks the door. Her mother explains that there is an empty flat on the other side that has yet to be let. Meantime, Coraline visits with the neighbors, all of whom warn her of impending danger. One day she discovers that the door in the parlor is unlocked and instead of the brick wall that had been there before, there is a corridor - so she goes exploring and discovers the danger of which the neighbors spoke.<br />Gaiman seems to be attempting to teach a moral lesson here and it is well received. \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" is certainly part of it, but it runs even deeper than that. Despite some overtly obvious clues in the story, it is still suspeseful. I found it to be well-written and a nice addition to the canon of children's fantasy.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Rated 5 for the music, 2.0 for the quantity.<BR>This is a 35 minute album that still has some filler. I feel that 6 tracks are really essential and the rest are 'extras'. I put down 24 dollars after tax (!!) and I got surprisingly little. <br />It's just that for that I think the booklet should have a few pages or the CD could be enhanced (a doc, lyrics or music video), Andrew could even play weird, downplayed acoustic, piano or string versions of the tracks on the second half. As it stands, less than half of the CD is covered in material. If it were full, it'd have made 5, easy.<br /> I'm really disappointed the sound doesn't have more songs and different sounding (though I appreciate the simplicity of the rock). The synths are a cool addition to the whole and I think we'll hear great things from his next disc (he's at work on now, and claims there will be way more, and better content). The tracklist order is a little strange too. If the music filled 50+ minutes and had less filler, it would be GREAT music and I would rate it 5 Stars, something I so badly wanted to do for this album. It's great to rock out to, but you can't make a meal out of candy. <br />The booklet is so tiny and flimsy that it falls out and creases when you open the disc. <br /> Still, this may be the first album that's as fun to listen to, as it must be for the musician (Andrew) to perform it!<br /> I don't think I'm asking for too much, for the amount we pay record companies these days, buyers deserve to get your money's worth or they will take the album online. It's really disheartening as a supporting fan/friend....

6300263673|5.0|It's starts as a cute story about Baby, who's name is really Francis, who is on holiday with her rich parents and her older sister. There she meets a dancer, Johnny, played by the handsome Patrick Swayze, and there's an imidiate attraction between them. When his dancepartner, Penny, gets pragnent, Baby sees this as her chance to \\"make the world a better place\\" and voluenteers to take the place as Johnny's partner in a dance contest. There's lots of hard work and dancing ahead, where Johnny is trying his best to learn Baby how do dance. But they represent two different social circles, Johnny's poor and Baby's rich, and that is meant to cause trouble... <br />I don't know how many times I've watched this movie, but no matter how many times I'll watch it, I know I'll still love it and keep it among my favourites. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze has a chemistry you will notice right away. It does look like they're having the time of their lives! And in addition, the music and the dancing will take your breath away!<BR>I highly recommend it to everyone. One thing's for sure... I would love to learn how to dance like that!!!

0440237688|5.0|The giver was a wonderful, riveting book. It was an easy read that I finished in three days. The giver showed what the world would have been like without memories, emotions or qualities a person holds that makes them unique. Everyone was protected from what might have hurt them in any way. It was strange but the book was excellet. I rated it as a 5.
B00005AR3G|5.0|After the &quot;Lion King&quot;, i watched Disney movies like &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and many others, and they lack the same feeling of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Lion King&quot; etc.<br />This movie breaks with everything that you expect from a Disney feature; it has so many laughs that if you didn't see the &quot;Walt Disney Pictures&quot; logo, you should think that this is a &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon, or something from the hand of Spumco (Ren &amp; Stimpy), this movie is great for kids, and the adults will enjoy it like kids, even you can find some humor, that only adults can understand... the only problem with this movie is that is very short.<br />The DVD has great sound, great picture and a lot of extras (that i hadn't reviewed yet).<br />As an adult, you will love this flick
0920236162|5.0|Fantastic!  The adventures of the feisty Princess Elizabeth will surely bring smiles and chuckles to girls and boys of all ages.  I'm giving this to my princess (my niece) for her upcoming 12th birthday.  I hope this will enlighten and give her insight to potential roles, choices, and self-perception as she walks into the the teen years that loom ahead!
6300215741|5.0|Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are beautifully paired in this film.  It's exciting, mysterious, romantic, and overall entertaining.  It's well worth seeing.  The wardrobe is very good and it holds one's interest.
0553573403|5.0|In the world of fantasy literature, there are a few massive, seemingly unending epics whose authors' names we hear time and time again, and rightly so. To craft a work so colossal in scope is a daunting task, and few can pull it off. At the top of a short list stands George R. R. Martin, author of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. These books avoid several pitfalls of the fantasy genre that many others cannot.<br />First, it's refreshing to read a high fantasy with a plot that doesn't hinge on one Ultimate Bad Guy who's bent on destroying the entire world for motives that are hackneyed, dubious, or simply omitted. Such fantasies can certainly be interesting, but we all know how they will end: within the first hundred pages of the first book, we know who the invincible hero is, and we know that he will live to fight and defeat the Ultimate Bad Guy on page 996 of the last book. The conflict that begins to unfold in Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is much more real, and more believable. It is multifaceted as well; by the second book in the series, there are not two sides to the conflict, but six. Furthermore, the sides are not so clearly defined. There are certainly virtuous and villainous characters to be found, but often honor hides behind a mask of darkness, and treachery beats in the hearts of heroes. And things only get better as the series goes on, which may seem unbelievable to those of us who have been waiting for six years for something, anything to happen in Jordan's stagnating \\"Wheel of Time.\\"<br />I've always been a fan of magic in fantasy novels, but \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is predominantly a military fantasy where its battles are concerned, and I find myself enjoying the break from the status quo. Magic and the supernatural are not absent from this series -- they do surface later on -- but they are otherworldly, alien. It's often mentioned in other fantasy worlds that commoners distrust magic because they don't understand it, and I find it interesting to be sharing their point of view for once. Martin doesn't need magic to craft a peerless tale.<br />There is also a much greater focus on political intrigue than you'd normally expect to find in a book of this nature, and it's truly fascinating and well-done. The constant maneuvering and double-dealings in this book keep the story moving in ways you won't guess; this is perhaps the least predictable of all the many fantasies I've read. Events that you think are unavoidable may not turn out at all as you'd imagined, and characters you were sure would live forever can meet a tragic twist of fate at any time. Sudden attacks and surprises lose some of their appeal in other novels when you know for certain who will survive; such is not the case in Martin's book.<br />The dialogue is well above average for the genre as well. It happens too often that fantasy characters are constantly given lines that no one would ever speak aloud, but Martin's dialogue is much better. Tyrion, especially, is so much fun to read; I often find myself laughing at his jokes.<br />Finally, the world that Martin has constructed is instantly believable and exquisitely detailed. A painstakingly crafted history is evident from the first pages of the book, and makes everything more believable, from the world itself to the motivations of its characters. The Seven Kingdoms look a lot more like a place that might actually exist than a romanticized vision of medieval times.<br />I can't imagine what anyone would hold against this book. There are a ton of names and events to follow, but if you're a fan of fantasy, that should be nothing new. And the appendix helps if you get lost. For those of you who are tired of predictable plots and stereotypical characters, for those of you who are tired of fantasy series that start strong and then go nowhere, pick up \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" and never look back.ring their point of view for once.

0676973779|4.0|Really, the only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because the author claims in his preface that the tale he is about to tell will have you believing in God.  Well, it's a good yarn, but not so moving that it has me embracing any religion.  I did like its overall message however.  <br />Martel is a gifted storyteller.  He hooks you with his opening words, and the remainder of the novel is simply him reeling you in.  I often worry when I enjoy the first half of a novel because the second half rarely lives up to its predecessor and I find myself disgruntled with the author's vision.  Not so with &quot;Life of Pi&quot;.  In fact, I possibly love the last 4 chapters more than any other part of the book.<br />An engaging fairy tale for adults with a potent message.  <br />Note:  If you have a weak stomach or are a hard core animal activist, some passages may be hard to handle.  No overt cruelty, just some graphic descriptions of nature in action.
B00000HYXB|5.0|&quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot; is a musical rendering of J. R. R. Tolkien's posthumously published &quot;Silmarillion,&quot; which tells the story of events before the Lord of the Rings trilogy, in the First Age of Middle-Earth.<br />If you've heard Blind Guardian before, then you know what to expect, though the music here even surpasses the band's usually high standard. If you're new to the band, this is as good a place to start as any. Vocalist Hansi Kürsch will probably make or break this for you, as his style is somewhat unique, and most songs feature intricately layered vocal harmonies, adding to the grandeur and power of the music. Blind Guardian's style is very well-suited to Tolkien, and this wonderfully constructed album does his epic justice.<br />Brief spoken tracks that advance the story are interspersed between the songs, and for the most part these are quite well done. (Those of you thinking about Rhapsody's narrator need not fear!) Of course, if you've never read the Silmarillion, you won't appreciate them as much, but you don't need to be familiar with any of Tolkien's works to appreciate this power metal classic. I'd rate it four stars if you've never read the Silmarillion, five stars if you have.
B000089CKH|2.0|I got this album after hearing Nada Surf's single, Popular.  I liked that because of the humorous approach it took to high school and the heavy edge it had to it.  That is gone in this album.  Instead the band has adopted a softer side.  They all sing (in harmony!) and their voices are nothing special at all.  Instrumentally, they sound exactly like all the other pop-rock bands out there.  They could be some other group, and you would never know.  <br />Their lyrics are [bad].  I had to keep myself from laughing out loud at the stupidity of the lyrics in various songs.  (Fruit Fly is the worst.)  <br />Baisically, there is no quality in this music to distinguish it from anything else.  Buy it if you want an entertaining 30 minutes - throw it away afterwords, because you'll never listen to it again.
B000002J20|2.0|I had problems with this one thirty years ago, and I still do.  Some great moments here and there, but lots of flashy, tuneless, pointless grandstanding as well, and as another reviewer has already pointed out, Jon Anderson was awfully full of himself back then.  <br />I still like 'Close to the Edge' a lot, though.
B000002HPV|5.0|Este Cd talvez no sea el mejor de toda la carrera de Björk, pero aún asi es un disco muy bueno, y hasta se podría decir que es un disco de colección, las canciones son muy buenas, esta vez todas fueron compuestas por ella misma y tienen un ritmo de Pop Sofisticado, aquí van las canciones:<br />01. Hunter: Una de las mejores canciones del disco según mi opinión, tiene muy buenos ritmos en el coro, y los que hayan visto el video de esta canción, sabrán que es muy bueno y que tiene exelentes efectos especiales, muy buena canción que merece estar como esta, la primera canción del album, auqnue no la mejor del album.<br />02. Joga: Quiza esta sea la mejor canción del album, es increible, tiene unos ritmos exelentes al comienzo de la cancion y durando la cancion, es una cancion admirable que merece ser reconocida por el gran sentimiento que se encuentra dentro de esta canción, una de las mejores de la trayectoria de Björk.<br />03. Unravel: Una bellisma balada, que se encuentra entre mis favoritas de Björk, la letra es increíble, solo tienen que escuchar toda esta canción completa y se darán cuenta de lo que me refiero, bellisima canción.<br />04. Bachelorette: Otra de las mejores canciones del disco, no hay palabras para expresar esta canción, tiene sonidos tan increíbles que no podría explicarlos, la letra también es muy buena, todo eso mas la voz de Björk hacen de esta canción única, el problema es que quizas sea un poco deprimente pero aún asi es muy buena.<br />05. All Neon Like: Para mi es la peor canción del album, pero aún asi es una buena canción que si la escuchan con atención, se darán cuenta que en cierto momento contiene pedazos del coro de la canción &quot;Hidden Place&quot; de su album &quot;Vespertine&quot;, aún asi, la peor canción del album.<br />06. 5 Years: Muy buena canción, no tan buena como otras del disco, pero aún asi, contiene unos ritmos en el coro que son increíbles y muy levantadores de ánimo, una canción muy feliz, como para escucharla varias veces.<br />07. Immature: Esta canción es muy buena, ya que contiene una letra simple, pero al mismo tiempo genial, ya que habla mucho sobre las personas inmaduras que todavía no son lo suficientemente inteligentes para darse cuenta de algunas cosas, pero aparte de ello, la canción en si no tiene muchos buenos ritmos, pero es muy buena debido a la letra.<br />08. Alarm Call: Indiscutiblemente, la mejor canción del disco y la mejor canción de todas las canciones de Björk, una canción muy feliz que es para recordar, primero empezando por los ritmos que empiezan desde el primer segundo de la cancion, simplemente increibles, luego la letra, no hay palabras para eso, solo miren la letra y se daran cuenta, y para colmo la genial voz de Björk sobretodo en los coros, esas tres cosas hacen a esta canción una de las mejores de la historia, se los aseguro, podrán escucharla millones de veces y nunca se aburrirán, y les aseguro que terminarán con una sonrisa en sus rostros porque es una canción muy alentadora, para que todos nos pongamos a pensar, no les digo más, solo escuchenla, y para colmo, el video de esta canción es simplemente increíble, y se ve muy bella Björk, mas que en otros videos, simplemente lo mejor.<br />09. Pluto: Una canción que se podría decir que es Rock, pero mas que eso quizas Tecno, es increíble escuchar los gritos de Björk en toda la canción, principalmente de eso se trata la canción, solo se escucha un ritmo que se va volviendo mas fuerte al igual que los gritos de Björk, pero aún asi es muy buena, tienen que escucharla.<br />10: All Is Full Of Love: Muy buena balada, perfecta para terminar el disco, te hace sonreír y enamorarte, es una de aquellas canciones de las que te enamoras, es simplemente increíble al igual que la letra, deben escucharla por favor, y si pueden vean el video que en una palabra se resume como increible, no pueden perderse esta cnación.<br />Bueno esas fueron lascanciones con sus respectivos comentarios, en resumen como podrán ver, este es un disco de colección que nadie puede dejar de tener, aunque no sean Fans de Björk, porque este disco es simplemente increíble, es por eso que merece mi puntuación de 5 estrellas, ojala lo compren.
B00006LLNV|5.0|This CD is a true masterpiece.  I LOVE IT!!!  It almost makes you feel what Frida and Diego were feeling when they were together.  To me the whole CD is all about what a passionate relationship is. Sometimes thrilling and joyous (La Bruja), and other times so sad you wish you could die (La Llorona or Paloma Negra).   I would recommed this CD to anyone who loves music and is romantic.  If only there were more CDs like this.
B00005R2M3|2.0|A pesar de que este disco es muy bueno, no se podría comparar con sus otros dos discos en español &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; y &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones&quot; pero en fin, está bien para ser su primer disco en Ingles, aqui van las canciones:<br />01. Objection: Es la versión en Inglés de &quot;Te Aviso, Te Anuncio&quot;, es una muy buena canción que tiene unos ritmos Argentinos de Tango, la letra también es muy buena. <br />02. Underneath Your Clothes: Muy buena canción, talvez la mejor del album, o por lo menos la mejor balada del album, que tiene muy buena letra y aunque sea una balada, muy buen ritmo.<br />03. Whenever, Wherever: Es la versión en Ingles de &quot;Suerte&quot;, fue la primera canción del album en ser lanzada, la letra es muy buena al igual que el video y los sonidos Peruanos-Bolivianos.<br />04. Rules: Buenisimas canción, aunque esta canción ya no contiene ritmos Latinoamericanos, es una muy buena canción en inglés.<br />05. The One: Otra muy buena balada, que al igual que &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot;, se convierte en una de las mejores de su primer album en Ingles.<br />06. Ready For The Good Times: Es una canción pop, que por alguna extraña razón, me hace recordar a Janet Jackson, esta canción ya es mucho más Pop y Futurista que las demas del album.<br />07. Fool: Es una canción que en cierto modo se parece a &quot;Rules&quot;, ya que ambas son buenas pero llegan a ser aburridas porque no tienen un ritmo convincente y demasiado bueno.<br />08. Te Dejo Madrid: La mejor canción en Español del album, es una canción que se la dedica a la ciudad de Madrid que tiene muy buenos ritmos que son muy buenos y no dejan nada que desear.<br />09. Poem To A Horse: Otra de las canciones tipo &quot;Fool&quot; y &quot;Rules&quot;, tiene un buen coro pero las demas partes de la canción son un poco aburridas y tontas.<br />10. Que Me Quedes Tu: Otra de las canciones en español, para mi es la peor canción del album pero en Latinoamerica está teniendo mucho éxito y a pesar de todo es una buena balada, pero no me llega a convencer.<br />11. Eyes Like Yours: Es la versión en Inglés de la conocida canción &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; del album &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones?&quot;, es muy buena canción con ritmos árabes pero pudo haber escogido otra canción de sus albumes para pasarla en Inglés, de todos modos muy buena.<br />12. Suerte: Es la versión en Español de la conocidisima canción &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, al igual que la versión en Inglés, esta canción contiene una muy buena letra, y de nuevo, los ritmos Peruanos.<br />13. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio: Es la versión en Español de la canción &quot;Objection&quot;, es igual a la versión en Inglés, con leves cambios en la letra pero con aún una muy buena letra, también contiene los ritmos de Tango al igual que la versión en Inglés.<br />Bueno, como podrán ver, en resumen este es un buen disco, pero en comparación con sus otros dos albumes, creo que pudo haber hecho un mayor esfuerzo para conseguir algo mejor, es por eso que este disco merece mi puntuación de solo 2 estrellas.
B000088E6M|5.0|After listening to 50 Cent's 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' I realised this is the illest sh*t I've heard in a long, long while.  50 gets shot nine times and he comes back nine times harder than before.  I've been waiting quite a while for this album to drop and think its one of the best rap albums I have in my collection.  His flow matches up well with Dre and Em's beats.  This is the future of 50 Cent.  If you think 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' is a poor CD you must be crazy.  Take a listen to Ja Rule's recent effort.  That is poor, just a washed up wanksta who sounds like the Honey Monster.  50 keep doing ya thing.  The CD is worth the money out of your wallet.  One the most exciting albums since Eminem's debut.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This CD is a great listen. I think that my biggest problem with it is the small amount of \\"new\\" songs, and the short running time. Of the 11 tracks, 3 are different versions of songs already on the album, only giving us 8 \\"new\\" songs. Not that I don't appreciate the inclusion of the original Russian versions of \\"All The Things She Said\\" and \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", just that a few more original songs would have been appreciated. <br />My favorite song on this CD would have to be \\"Stars\\". The Russian rap really makes the song, giving it a different feel and a different flow. I also loved the remake of \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" where I think Julia and Lena's voices are shown off well. I think the most disappointing track would have to be \\"Malchick Gay\\". The song doesn't flow at all. The chorus feels awkward and stiff, and coming just before \\"Stars\\", \\"Malchick Gay\\" simply pales in comparison.
6305546789|5.0|The modern era of the American horror film officially began in 1968 with the release of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. These two films<br />pushed the envelope with tales of zombies and satanic cults. Though there were zombie-like creatures and satanic cults in movies before 1968, Romero and Polanski redefined the monsters--thereby redefining the role of the hero and the victim--and situated horror in the everyday world of contemporary America.<br />The 1970's again took horror to new heights with films such as William Friedkin's The Exorcist. In 1973, The Exorcist shocked audiences with images of gore and new special effects. When first released, the film created mass hysteria in theaters, with people fainting and paramedics on the scene.<br />In the fall of 1978, a little horror film premiered in Kansas City. It didn't generate the buzz of The Exorcist, but it did really well and also opened in Chicago, later earning showings in New York. From there, it had a platform release all across the country, playing in different cities all over the world. Through word of mouth, the film became a hit. To this day, John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" remains a classic and is considered one of the best slasher films of all time. It started a trend in horror films that has been imitated to this day--the invincible stalker who preys on young women.<br />The film was made on a shoestring budget and went on to become one of the most profitable films ever. Halloween, more than any other film in history, has been copied and duplicated, and even earned numerous catch phrases to describe itself: splatter film, slasher film, etc. It is not uncommon for horror films in recent years to have five or more sequels, most of which are poorly made remakes of the original that go straight to video(can we say Children of the Corn?), and the success of \\"Halloween\\" and its sequels helped set this trend.<br />The film begins on a cold Halloween night in 1963, when six year old Michael Audrey Myers brutally murders his 17-year old sister, Judith Myers, in the tiny town of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is sentenced to Smith's Grove-Warren Country Sanitarium for committing the brutal crime. He remains locked within the hospital walls for 15 years, until, one fatal Halloween night in 1978, he escapes while being transferred to another hospital. Slowly and quietly, Michael makes his way to his hometown, where on Halloween night, havoc will ensue. No one is safe against the sinister force of his evil, especially not young Laurie Strode, played by a then 19-year old Jamie Lee Curtis in her first starring role, who is unfortunate enough to be spending the night baby-sitting.It is evident in the quality of the film that it still retains the ability to shock and frighten despite the fact that many of its plot devices have been numbed by a modern familiarity. \\"Halloween\\" is a bona-fide genre classic and masterpiece of tension, atmosphere and suspense. They certainly don't make horror films like this anymore...963, when six year old Michael Audrey Myers brutally murders his 17-year old sister, Judith Myers, in the tiny town of Haddonfield, Illinois.

B00005JLXC|3.0|This year, many comic book based movies will be coming out in the theaters. A few examples are X-men 2, The Hulk, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. If you're going to see one comic book based movie this year, I'd honestly wait for one of those (X-men looks REALLY good) but if your content on seeing them all Daredevil is not a complete waste of your time. It tells the story of comic book hero, Matthew Murdock (played by Ben Afleck), who at twelve, lost his sight after being exposed to radio active chemicals. Strangely enough this incident not only left him blind but with amazing powers. His other senses are so strong that he can experiences the world around him better than we do. Years later he is semi-sucessful lawyer who only defends criminals who are innocent. But by night he is Daredevil, a superhero who takes down villains who manage to slip through the justice system.<br />Although I have never read the comic books, I find the story line to be fascinating. Our hero is not a very admirable person. He takes it upon himself to be the living embodiment of justice, meaning he will take anyone out who he thinks is guilty enough. If portrayed the right way Daredevil could be seen as a very dark hero who struggles with himself more than he struggles with his villains. Unfortunately either due to bad writing or Ben Afleck's mediocre acting, you find you know very little about the character of Matt Murdock. Unless you read reviews or were familiar to the comics you would have no idea on why he sleeps in that strange water filled chamber. How does the priest know of his alter identity? There are many more questions that need to be answered. Although Afleck does a good job you don't feel as if he really gets into the character as much as say, Tobey Maquire did with Peter Parker in Spiderman. This is very odd because Afleck is supposedly such a big DD fan.<br />Another complaint I have is the lack of development of the romantic and vengeance storyline involving Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner). Yes, Gardner does just fine with the acting thing, that's not the problem. The problem is you never feel as if the two main characters had the time to really fall in love. Another problem I had is I, going into the movie, I suspected the plot to be very much based Eletrka wanting revenge for her father's death, who she blames on Daredevil, not knowing that it is the man she has fallen in love with. This story line is very minor and isn't really brought up until the end. In fact the end is so rushed that you feel as if they didn't care about tying up all of the lose ends in the plot. All they wanted to do was prepare for the possible sequel, which I kind of doubt will happen.<br />My last problem with this movie is with the villains. You can tell Colin Farrel, who plays the evil Bullseye with deadly aim, really had a lot of fun with this role. He just seems to ooze comic book villain. Unfortunately he is character is given so little screen time that you never get to learn anything about it besides, as my friend so eloquently put it \\"he likes to throw stuff.\\" Still he's the only actor that when you look at him in this movie, you think about the character he plays, not the actor that plays the character. Michael Clark Duncan (yeah the guy from Green Mile) who plays Kingpin, the crity's crim leader, does an okay job but to be honest the scariest thing about him is his voice, not his character. That's not too good when he's supposed to be the big villain of the movie.<br />Now that I'm done complaining (never thought I'd be done did you?) here's what I liked about the movie. The visual effects are stunning. It's probably one of the most visually pleasing movies I've seen so far in 2003. They manage to really let you see what Daredevil is seeing, even though he is blind. My favorite part would have to be any scene where Matt uses the rain to help him see. It really emphasizes the romance in this movie without making it seem cheesy and boring. Also they do a very good job explaining the background off Matt which gives some real insight into his character. The action seens are incredible and you can't help wondering, what will happen next?<br />So that's how I feel about this movie. If I were you, I would rent it on video. It's a decent movie and if they make a sequel (which I have my doubts on) I'll probably end up seeing it as well. It's not a bad movie but it's not a very good one either.
0783114222|4.0|\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is an epic worthy to tell the Gemini and Apollo astronauts' stories.<br />That said, the one thing that jarred me was the amatuerish special effects that occasionally popped up.  For instance, when Alan Shepard reenters the earth's atmosphere in Freedom 7, it almost looks like a tiny model strung up in front of a sky backdrop--it reminded me of the old 60's TV show \\"Thunderbirds,\\" it was so hokey.  It was obvious that HBO did not have the bankroll to snag Digital Domain, the same people who did \\"Apollo 13.\\" (To steal a quote from another space film: \\"No bucks, no Buck Rogers.\\")<br />Luckily, those glaring moments are few and far between, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
B0000024SD|5.0|In 1965 Bob Dylan did the unthinkable.  He got together a back up band and recorded his fifth album 'Bring It All Back Home'.  Knowing that his hardcore folkie fans would never forgive him for going electric, Dylan did it regardless.  And who could blame him?  He simple couldn't go on strumming on his acoustic and blowing on his harmonica forever.  Dylan was destined to get into the rock genre it was inevitable.  And it wasn't such a bad change despite what Folk fans say.  He still sounds like everbody's favourite folk singer.<br />The music has improved greatly the album is more commercially appealing and colorful than Dyaln's earlier efforts.  Who can forget there first taste of Dylan's electric guitar on the classic SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK BLUES.<BR>The beautiful SHE BELONGS TO ME is a great change of pace for Dylan and it has excellent lyrics.  The excellent MAGGIE'S FARM is outrageous fun.  LOVE MINUS ZERO/NO LIMIT is another pleasing song while OUTLAW BLUES is a great rocker.  The classics ON THE ROAD AGAIN and BOB DYLAN'S 115TH DREAM are vintage Dylan.  Of course Dylan was still thinking of his acoustic folk fans.  So to satisfy them as best as he could he produced four wonderful acousitc song to close this classic.  Everybody knows the classic MR.TAMBOURINE MAN which has become one of Dylan's most classic songs.  GATES OF EDEN is a great anti war anthem.  The last two songs are my personal faves.  IT'S ALRIGHT MA (I'M ONLY BLEEDING) is seven minutes of poetic bliss with a great acoustic riff while IT'S ALL OVER NOW BABY BLUE is just a nice closer for this album.  Sure Dylan's voice is really rough on this one but just listen to it he's putting his heart and soul into it.  Listen to The Byrds version (on the cd version of TURN! TURN! TURN!) it's a great cover!   <br />'Bring It All Back Home' brought Bob Dylan into new heights of commercial success that he had experienced before.  And he would only go on to bigger and better things on his next album 'Highway 61Revisited' but it's 'Bringing It All Back Home' that's Dylan's turning point or transitional stage and thats what makes it so special.<br />Overall 'Bring It All Back Home' is another classic from the man himself Bob Dylan.  A good place for some Dylan fans to start perhaps as well because it shows both electric and acoustic sides of Mr.Zimmerman.  Either way this is an excellent album and once again another one of Bob Dylan's finest records.  Highly recommended!
B000084T18|4.0|50 comes out strong with what isn't really his debut, but is his 1st mainstream album.  The Dre and Eminem beats r sick.  \\"What Up Gansta\\", \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"Many Men Wish Death\\", and \\"In Da Club\\" start this tight cd.  All have nice beats, especially the intense \\"Patiently Waiting\\".  \\"21 Questions\\" with Nate Dogg is a great song with nice soft beat, with timeless lyrics (And always remember girl we make mistakes/to make it up I do whatever it take/<BR>I love you like a fat kid love cake).  \\"Wanksta\\" is actually not 1 of his better songs, but a street anthem nonetheless.  \\"High All the Time\\" is a dope track too.<br />This is one of the best debut albums to come out in awhile.  He keeps it real and is real rap, unlike some hip pop rappers out rite now.  Not a classic debut cd, but nonetheless great.  If you want some real ... by 50, get Power of the Dollar. It blows this album away.
0312979479|5.0|simply the best agatha christie novel i've read so far (and i've read them all...)!<br />highly recommended to fans of other mystery writers.<br />by the way, can anybody tell me if i can find the movie (with john gielgud?) on vhs or dvd?
0316666343|3.0|I usually run screaming from movies and books that top anyone's &quot;Best Of&quot; list, or reach such a mainstream, wide audience.  I read this book at the recommendation of a friend that I trust implicitly.  I have to say that although I think that the concept of this book is unique and bordering on pure genius (the narration of the story is from a girl in heaven), I really can't say that I feel it was executed all that well.<br />I know that I am in the minority for saying this and will probably get a zillion people saying that my review didn't help them at all, just because they don't agree with me. That's fine.  I know thousands of people have read this book and have been moved beyond belief by it.  It didn't do that to me at all.  <br />I found parts of the book riveting, but as soon as I would get really into it, I'd find my mind wandering, thinking about other things.  I think Ms. Sebold spends a bit too time much on details, and her details were foggy at best a lot of the time.  There seemed to be a few characters that the book would have been better off without. I found myself cringing whenever their names came up. &quot;Oh no, not them again. Yawn.&quot;  Ultimately, these characters really didn't have much to do with the story. Had the book been a bit streamlined, it would have made for a quicker read (at least as far as I'm concerned). I found myself having to go back and re-read passages, because either I was confused by what had happened or because it didn't hold my attention and I started daydreaming!  I've never experienced anything like this with any other book that I've read.  And I have read a zillion books in my life!  <br />In the end, I felt like the family never got any sort of justice.  Sure, Mr. Harvey sees a deserved fate, but Susie's family doesn't know about it.  It was hard to get behind some of the characters and be on their sides. What happened to Susie is terrible, and the story tells how the family reacts to it.  Although their depression doesn't really make for a completely sad book, at the end it's not altogether uplifting. I sort of felt indifference. If anything, I was just happy that I was finally done with the book! It was just very slow moving for me.
B00006SFLV|5.0|My husband bought me the &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; DVD box set for Valentine's Day and I spent the entire weekend re-watching all of it. I was 20 when it was on network TV and I could totally relate to Angela. Now I'm 29, a mother of two and disturbed because I can see things from Patty's point of view now. But at the same time, I still feel much like Angela. Wow, does anyone *ever* feel like they fit in? I hear alot of people complain about the series being canceled and while I would have loved to have seen more of Angela, Rayanne, Rickie and the rest of the gang, I don't think it would have been as good.  This way, it's like finding an old diary in a used book store.  All you get to know is that one finite portion of that person's life that they chose to put down on paper.  Sometimes it's better to wonder. Anyway, this set is great.  All I can say is, &quot;I am telling you, we had a time. Didn't we? Didn't we have a time?&quot;
0066214122|2.0|I read nearly all of michael's novels. This is my least favourite. The topic nanotechnology is exciting and Michael, as usual, does do his homework on it but the story and the characters he built around it somehow do not fit in it. An out of work team leader who does household duties, a handful of programmers becoming biologists and a working mom/full time scientist all handling the 21st century nanotechnology: it just does not match. With this topic at hand, the particles able to resemble a human form, I was more thinking of the liquid robot from the Terminator 2 and with that given you can create a much more juicy story.
B000000WJZ|3.0|This albums pales in comparison to MBV's supreme masterpiece Loveless. Billy Corgan simply wishes he was as a good a musician as Kevin Shields but he never will be. Today is a great song but the rest of the album isn't strong enough to compete with MBV. Even &quot;Isn't Anything&quot; is probably a better album.
B000000QG2|4.0|Despite his fiery guitar-playing, his stunning live performances and his single-minded adherence to the true spirit of rock n’ roll, Rory Gallagher (from Ballyshannon in Ireland) never made the big league, never getting the full backing of his record comp any. A shame, because here is a guy who liked his blues rough and raw. Add passionate fretboard work; songwriting savvy;  a high-octane, souped up Stratocaster to the formula and you have rock heaven. The keyword is energy. It literally oozes out of the speakers.  Follow Me is impressive by any standards. When the rhythm section of Gerry Macavoy (bass) and Ted McKenna (drums) kicks in, the energy and power is extraordinary. Keychain, Wayward Child and Bad Penny are other highlights, with Rory laying down the blues as though he invented it, and adding to the blistering blues licks an unmistakable Celtic tone that makes Rory Gallagher a truly unique blues/rock artist. Although not all the songs on the album live up to Follow Me (and points off for the unecessary bonus tracks), and Rory’s vocals are more rough and ready than accomplished, those who want an introduction to one of the world’s top blues/rock Strat-toting guns, who died just a few years ago long before his time was up,  should check out Top Priority..
B000002MJ0|5.0|My Bloody Valentine is the greatest band ever. One of the only ones who can hold their own against the Beatles. Amazing music.
B00005JLO2|5.0|When I saw the rating of 3stars given this movie...I could NOT believe it...I have not seen a movie this powerful in a very LONG time...everyone I know who has seen it, wants to see it again...the story of overcoming fear...and finding you have more courage, and raw endurance then you ever thought possible was extremely powerful...not to mention the loyalty,real loyalty,and is quite wonderful to see, even in a movie. Great movie.
B000002UVX|5.0|When I bought the Original release of \\"Band Of Gypsys\\" in the 70's, The cut now titled as \\"Power To Love,\\" was titled, \\"Power Of Soul.\\"<br />Is this a misprint, or was it intentionally changed due to the fact that Hendrix, regarded as the greatest ROCK (i.e. \\"White\\" in most circles) Musician/Guitarist ever, can't be associated with SOUL? (i.e.\\"Black\\" in most circles) <br />If so, what a PETTY INSULT to the memory of the man who's music encompassed the colors of the rainbow!!!!
B000002GAF|5.0|I remember getting this album in a cut-out bin<BR>in 1980 and wore it out. I was 13 then. 23 years<BR>later, and I still think it just kicks [...]I<BR>consider it as big people think of Beatles Sgt<BR>Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band or Pet Sounds but<BR>you can rarely find a review of it anywhere.<BR>Highlights are \\"Brother To Brother\\" and \\"The<BR>Wheels Of Life.\\"
B0000029J5|4.0|As a &quot;strong hearted&quot; listener myself I've come to realize that there are people out there who just don't &quot;get&quot; the soulful essence of a rare performer like Keb' Mo' and there are no words that can explain it to them.<BR>    Its gives me much optimism when I realize the Music  industry has recognized the God given talent of someone like Keb' Mo' with a grammy award. Usually you expect a commercially exploited sound to win that honor. However, here the intrinsic abliliies of a future blues phenom are noted by the grammy award. A huge step in the right direction for an otherwise shallow tin cup honor. <BR>     This CD captures the essence of Keb's voice where that undescribable energy emminates from the soul. For Keb it's an extremely rare feel-good energy that transcends all sound barriers. It originates from the depths of soul and for most blues artist it rarely leaves its imprint on the vocal recordings. <BR>   Keb is the exception to the rule, much the way BB King or Muddy Waters carries such a rare gift. However, I feel that some of Keb's more recent recorded CD i.e. &quot;Slow Dow&quot; are more masterfully produced, with all around crisper recording sessions. But as a recognized &quot;debut&quot; CD this album should not be omitted from any serious blues fan's collection.
B000084T18|4.0|Let me first say that this is no \\"Ready to Die,\\" \\"Illmatic\\" or \\"36 Chambers.\\" I'm not sure who said that this album was in the same league (probably Eminem) but unfortunately it is not. What \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is, is a solid major label debut from an up-and-coming rap artist. It definitely has more going for it than it has going against it.<br />Lately I have become weary of commercialized rap and I was quite surprised to find myself listening to this album. If you've turned on the radio at all in the last couple years, the content of this offering will not shock or amaze you; ghetto life, women and drug trafficing are all very prevalent here. However, if you have bought any mainstream hip-hop CD's lately, you will be extremely pleased when you find that all of the songs on \\"Get Rich...\\" are very listenable; there are no tracks that make you want to instantly skip ahead to the next.<br />After a short intro and one average track (\\"What Up Gangsta?\\") the album starts rolling. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" takes a page out of Enimem's book (\\"Lose Yourself\\") and raps about finally getting his big break. Eminem even shows up for a verse. \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\" follows and is one of the hottest tracks of the album. No doubt drawing from several close calls with death, 50 Cent comes correct on this track, telling his foes that he isn't going anywhere. \\"In Da Club\\" follows and it really needs no introduction. This song is destined to be played in the club scene for years to come. \\"High All the Time\\" is yet another hot track that shows you a more laid back version of 50 over top of excellent production. \\"If I Can't\\" is one of those songs that will get in your head and having you nodding for days. \\"Back Down\\" has 50 Cent taking aim nemesis Ja Rule. It's not like anyone else needs to point out how pitiful Ja Rule has become, but 50 Cent does it and does it quite well. While not as good as his previous Ja Rule diss, \\"Wanksta\\" (included on the CD as a bonus track) it's still worth a listen.<br />The CD starts to lag for several tracks after \\"Back Down.\\" \\"P.I.M.P.\\" sounds a little too much like a poor man's version of Jay-Z's \\"Big Pimpin.\\" \\"Like My Style\\" tries to be jiggy but doesn't come off that smoothly and \\"Poor Lil' Rich\\" gets a little repetitive after the chorus is repeated several times. Luckily \\"21 Questions\\" comes along to save the day. Featuring the underappreciated Nate Dogg, \\"21 Questions\\" is 50's love song. The beats are smooth and the lyrics are thoughtful, making this track a winner. Eminem makes another appearance on the uninspired \\"Don't Push Me\\" before the album closes out nicely with \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven.\\"<br />Lyrically 50 Cent is not going to amaze you. His distinct voice and solid flow are pluses but he is not as deep lyrically as a Nas or Jay-Z. 50 Cent does have a propensity for singing on his own tracks and that can get annoying after a while. There are also parts where he sounds like he is mumbling, another potential turn-off. Still, the energy that 50 Cent exudes on the mic draws you into the songs, something a lot of rap artists these days are missing.<br />Dr. Dre and Eminem produce most of the beats for this LP and, overall they are good while not groundbreaking. The production also varies nicely, ranging from the club friendly \\"In Da Club,\\" to a more laid back \\"21 Questions\\" all the way the island sounds of \\"P.I.M.P.\\" Even when the lyrical content starts to sound stale, the beats keep your head nodding.<br />With 16 tracks (plus 3 bonus ones) it's surprising that none of it sounds like filler. If you don't mind gangsta rap and are sick of the junk that gets played on the radio these days, 50 Cent's \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" is more than worthy of your purchase.a listen.<br />The CD starts to lag for several tracks after \\"Back Down.\\" \\"P.I.M.P.\\" sounds a little too much like a poor man's version of Jay-Z's \\"Big Pimpin.\\" \\"Like My Style\\" tries to be jiggy but doesn't come off that smoothly and \\"Poor Lil' Rich\\" gets a little repetitive after the chorus is repeated several times.

B000002W4V|2.0|Both with The Velvet Underground and with much of his solo output, Lou Reed has managed to tap into domains of the modern social consciousness in utterly unique and essential ways.  One of the most extraordinary features of Lou's music has been its powerfully penetrating resonance within dimensions of the psyche that overlap and intermingle in undulating tides of transformation, love, hatred, realism, drama, seriousness, sarcasm, uncertainty, toughness, tenderness, seediness and beauty.  At his best, Lou is honest and compelling.  Such a commitment to emotional honesty, however, can make for a turbulent evolutionary ride - sometimes leading to a virulent brew of self-deprecation and resentment toward the world while constantly trying to stay true amidst life's relentless trials and changes.  Rock and Roll Animal seems to represent just such a crisis point in Lou's growth.  Here we have a parody of mainstream rock so blatant that it is difficult to imagine anyone taking it seriously.  The bombastic solos and flamboyant arrangements simultaneously ridicule and capitalize on the hype of the glam rock era.  Lou's singing seems to vary between a sneer and a yawn, as if daring us to realize the obvious.  On this album Lou is cashing in on the caricature people had made him out to be; all the while seeming unsure whether he wants to laugh or spit.  Metal Machine Music was perhaps a more blatant response to this same ambivalence, but on Animal Lou is showing us just how ridiculous the situation can become when the true soul of rock and roll is tainted with the ignorance of comodification and shallow hype.  Laugh it up kids.
B000006CCG|4.0|I heard this one for the first time in early 85 and I was floored. I was listening to bands like Twisted Sister, Ratt and Motley Crue at the time and I expected WASP to be along those lines. They were to some extent, but they had a harder edge. I listened to this album over and over at the time and I still listen to it every once in awhile. My favorite songs are School Daze, The torture never stops, I wanna be somebody and Sleeping in the fire. This was their best album until the did Headless children five years later.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've been a Beatles' fan since I was 3 years of age and All I would see on Television is other people telling the story of The Beatles without proof to some rumors about what really happened to Paul during the \\"Paul is Dead\\" days, What was really said by John Lennon during an Interview with a Reporter which brought out The controversial speech about \\"Why The Beatles' where bigger than GOD.(An interview that was taken out of context)The reason why they had to stop touring,Or the real story about who really Broke up the group in the 1970's and ofcourse The History of their Drug Abuse.Well, I was happy when I purchased The VHS version.Like The Rolling Stones' Version of 25X5.The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones.The Beatles also along with snipets of John Lennon answering questions that went along with The other three's memory of their history gave me a better insight of the group through their own words.I appeciated that they did it that way to silence the critics and to set the record straight about the rumors surronding the group.I also enjoyed The first video in many years of \\"Free as a bird\\" with John Lennon's original demo combinded with the mellow sounds of Paul and George Singing Background Like the old days in the 60's.I have to tell you .It made me cry to wonder what could have been if Lennon was alive and would the frenzy still continue after all these years.I would have wanted the other video \\"Real Love\\" with Post psychedelic overtones coveying to the later 1960's and early 70's.But the whole VHS series was just wonderful over all.Either if you get the VHS Version or the newly released DVD version with more extras( maybe with the  two videos \\"Free as a bird\\",\\"Real Love\\" and The Concert of the 3 surviving Beatles playing a mini concert that I have heard about.)I believe that you will not only enjoy The Beatles' Anthology.You are going to treasure it as I did.So get before it runs out.You'll be glad you did.
0312305060|2.0|I saw the movie \\"The Hours\\" and loved it!!! I thought I just had to read the book. I purchased both \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and \\"The Hours\\", knowing \\"The Hours\\" was inspired by \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" (for the first time) and was greatly moved by how Virginia Woolfe could show you how much really takes place in one day, how much interactions and thoughts in one day can really change your life. It is a very poignant book. Then I read \\"The Hours\\" and I was disgusted by it. I knew from the movie that the author intentionally was trying to draw similarities between Clarissa Vaughan and Clarissa Dalloway, but in the book he went too far. He basically copied Virginia Woolfe's work and it is a mediocre copy. I agree with Michelle McSweeney's review that he made a \\"cover\\" of literture. He just updated situations from 1920's life to 1990's life. Clarissa Vaughan encounters almost the exact same situations as Clarissa Dalloway, such as being insulted because she was not invited to a lunch and both having an 18-year old daughter that is being drawn away from her. In some sections of the book it feels like Michael Cunningham comes very close to plagiarizing Woolfe's book.  I find \\"The Hours\\" insulting to Virginia Woolfe's work especially since he won awards for copying it. I feel so disgusted by this that it is hard to enjoy the rest of the book, the only part that is supposedly original.<br />My advice, if you actually want to enjoy reading \\"The Hours\\" do not read \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" (especially not first), otherwise you will be as disappointed as I am.
B00006LLNV|5.0|First off, BUY THIS CD!! If you loved the movie- and I can't see why you wouldn't- you'll love the CD.  The music is deep and seductive. And for all of us musical masochists out there, it sweeps you away into a field of tortured emotion.  <br />BUT??  The enhanced CD function is a downside. Don't get me wrong, the extras are great, but for some odd reason, I can't play the MUSIC on my computer.  The only files on the CD are the enhanced features.  Winamp won't open it,  I searched the CD contents and can't find any music files.  I play all of my music using my computer, I don't have a CD player except in my car, and  so, now,I can't play this CD at home. <br />Does anyone else have this problem?  Has anyone gotten it to work? Please email me if you have.  The websites say nothing about it.
B000002UAX|5.0|One of the great Beatles albums. Like every other album they ever made, this one has many classics and a few throw-aways. Overall, the music is excellent and they continue to take music to an entirely different level of brilliance. Flirting with many different musical styles, this is perhaps their most diverse record. It is a masterwork that you very much owe it to yourself to listen to....
B00003CXXM|2.0|OK, here's the problem: I've read the book three times already,(and I know I'll read it again), so I can fairly say it's one of my favourites. I saw this film and I found almost nothing even similar to the book.    <BR>If you did not read the book, the film is OK, entertaining and with LOTS of action, but if you are an old Jason Bourne fun like me, go grab your old paperback, relax and stick to the real J.B.
B000001OAA|5.0|The album works well as a whole.  Supervixen pulls you in for a ride that leaves you asking for more after Milk.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Being Baz Lurhmann's first major film directing, \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is a delightful modern life comedy about a ballroom dancer (Scott) who has the urge to self-express by dancing his own steps in the ballroom-dancing championship, which, as it can be imagined, is considered to be an offense to the tradition. The film itself is full of dynamics and energy, with swift scene leaping, sometimes very casual camera work that gives you a documentary kind of feeling. Paul Mercurio, who plays the dancer Scott, is a brilliant dancer as well as a fiery actor, and Fran, Scott's dancing partner, is naturally acted by Tara Morice, who, with no short of passion in her dancing with Paul Mercurio, brings poetic beauty and realness to the character. There are wonderful songs and dances through out the film. It's entertaining, it's funny, and more or less, it makes you think about your own life. \\"A life lived in fear is a life half lived\\" is the essence of the movie, which I believe is also the motto that guides Baz Lurhmann in his artistic creation. For many years, one after another, he has brought out brilliant works - stage or screen - with freshness and creativity. As much as I respect the traditions, I admire the courage to challenge the traditions. Ballroom dancing can be dull without the occasionally-popped-out rule-breaker like Scott, and so is the realm of art without the genius like Baz Lurhmann.
B000002J09|5.0|Only purchased the album because I found out the Beastie Boys sampled beats and guitar riffs from this particular album for Licensed to Ill.  Now I see that the Beastie Boys are second rate compared Led Zeppelin.<br />Someone stole my CD's of Licensed to Ill and Led Zepplin IV out of my truck last summer.  They left the other CD's alone.  Strange.
0671004107|5.0|There is more imagination and intriguing conflict in the book than in anything Hollywood could produce.  Sagan was a gift to readers who value thought above hyperbole and substance over style (though the book lacks for nothing in the style department).  The best aspect of the book was the author's ability to take broad and complex ideas and theories from the realms of science and religion and make them completely understandable to the layperson.  It was extraordinarily easy to read yet at the same time so packed with great characters and dialogue and thought-provoking material that I felt compelled to pause to digest and appreciate and reread quite a bit.<BR>The movie was utterly mediocre.  It glossed over virtually every conflict and resolution and made the Arroway character (one of the strongest and most dynamic female characters I've ever read) into a sniveling sympathy magnet.  If not for a few amusing political subplots and some entertaining effects, the movie would qualify as the worst adaptation of a novel that I have ever seen.  It was a waste of some serious acting talent and an insult to a modern fiction masterpiece.<BR>If you've already seen the movie, do whatever you have to do to forget it, then read the book.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love this cd. I got it for christmas, and have been listening to it ever since. I know all the words, to every songs, even the Russian untranslated ones!
B000089CPF|1.0|Another yawn-fest of boring pseudo-folk songs from this overrated Tucson band.  White people professing their Hispanic influences is about as valid as Vanilla Ice pretending to be down with the 'hood, and using a Mariachi band as back-up musicians is just as offensive as John Courgar Mellencamp utilizing gospel singers to make it seem like he's a funk soul brother.  Sorry, Calexico, but you're Gringos and you always will be--no amount of lyrics about migrant workers eating tortillas is ever going to change that.  On top of this, the music is so laid-back, so devoid of energy, it's positively coma-inducing.  It makes Giant Sand sound like Metallica.  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
B00005KK4P|4.0|I would really like to give this recording 4.5 stars, because it is truly excellent- the sound quality, the interpretations in general, and the price! There are wonderful fourth, sixth, and ninth symphonies, and great fifth and eigth.  However, the only reason I hold the last .5 of a star is the fifth symphony, one of my favorites is a little slow, especially in the first movement.  It really doesn't bother me- Bohm makes many of the inner qualities shine with the more deliberate tempo, and not a moment is uninteresting!  The eigth is the same situation, but not as bad, and is one of my favorite &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot; interpretations ever. Overall, superb!  A must for any Schubert fan!
B00005OC06|4.0|This just might be my favorite of the four film versions of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; available on video. True, it's less &quot;pretty&quot; than the Verona, La Scala, and Frederic Mitterand versions, but it's more dramatically interesting and intense. If prettiness is what you think &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; is mainly about, get the video from Verona (the prettiest &quot;Butterfly&quot; I know), and leave this one alone. But if you want good dramatic impact, then this one is the one I most highly reccomend.
B0000041WV|5.0|Hours of enjoyment is brought to me by this wonderful, inexpensive set!  Splendid Interpretations of sym. 6, 7, and 8 , and of course a wonderful 9th.  The sound is excellent except for one little distortion of the brass at the beginning of the sixth, but that is nothing compared to the fine quality of, well...everything, the rest of the time!  Highly Recommended!
B00005B4GU|5.0|&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is Radiohead's best song ever.  A number of other songs are memorable, such as Pyramid Song, Knives Out, Dollars &amp; Cents, as well as You and Who's Army (the second half).  Maybe not quite as good as Kid A from top to bottom, but still an amazing album from an ever-changing band.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Solti is one of my all time favorite conductors, and this inexpensive set of Brahms'great symphonies (and overtures) are beyond praise.  Well-judged tempo, extraordinary phrase climaxes and interpretations, and possibly the best 1st symphony and Academic Overture I've heard.  BRAVO!

B00005OWEG|1.0|Two good reasons to avoid this DVD :<BR>1) The Coppola's renewed masterpiece is NOT presented in its original aspect ratio (2:35), and has been scanned into a smaller format (1:85), which is inexcusable. <BR>2) Absolutly no extra features

0792844882|3.0|It is rather amazing to consider how many other films resonate in \\"Showgirls,\\" the NC-17 film where the film was never equal to the hype.  You have the chorus girl wanting to be a star plot line that goes back to \\"Morning Glory\\" and beyond, the back stage back biting of \\"All About Eve,\\" the stylized sexy dancing of \\"Flashdance,\\" the dancing auditions of \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"A Chorus Line,\\" the sleazy showbiz world of \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" the Las Vegas Glitz of \\"Oceans 11,\\" the falling down the stairs from \\"Kiss of Death,\\" the woman taking vengeance on her own angle of \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" and the naked dancing women of \\"The First Nudie Musical.\\"  This list is enougth to convince me that what ever else it might be, \\"Showgirls\\" is not a \\"message\\" film.<br />I know the film is now considered a camp classic rather than a mega-bomb, but neither description rings true for me.  Nor would I consider the movie to be erotic, although I have no doubt that every lap dancer in the United States would resent the performance Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) puts on for Zack Carey (Kyle MacLachlan) while Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon) watches and wishes for her own turn in the chair.  The scene in the pool is not bad, but it sure seems like all the brief scenes between Nomi and another woman have more heat than any of extended scenes with her and a man.  Go figure.  Besides, the idea of a putting out a big buck soft porn film is rather oxymoronic because those who find \\"Showgirls\\" to be a sexy film were never going to want to go to the local Cinemaplex to watch it; they were going to want to watch it in the privacy and comfort of their own home (it is not like those people were going to ever be able to get a date to go out and see this film).<br />In the featurette on this DVD Joe Eszterhas takes time out from laughing all the way to the bank and back to tell us that \\"Showgirls\\" is really nothing more than a rock and roll musical, which makes sense except for the fact that the music is not exactly rock and roll and everybody is dancing rather than singing, which would make it some sort of ballet.  But the idea that the film is a musical is worth considering because it is a simple way of explaining why Paul Verhoeven was the wrong director for this film.  Verhoeven's approach is more than voyeur than the auteur and for the most part he does little more with the camera besides point it at the actors while they dance/writhe around (i.e., exactly what he did when Sharon Stone and Leilani Sarelle were on the dance floor together in \\"Basic Instinct\\").  I have to think that any director of a second level MTV music video could have shot and cut this film to much better effect.  Then again, what better way of defining what is sexy in movies than to say that there is nothing in \\"Showgirls,\\" with its totally naked star, to rival Sharon Stone totally dressed (almost) in \\"Basic Instinct.\\"<br />I do want to add that I do not think \\"Showgirls\\" is going to destroy Elizabeth Berkley's Hollywood career.  All you need to do is to remember that Jessica Lange did a lot more than merely survive making \\"King Kong\\" and you have to think the actress will survive having bared everything (repeatedly) in this film.  Berkley certainly turns in an earnest performance, and when she talks in the featurette about working hard so that the stripping was more like dancing than stripping per se, you have to agree that is an accurate description of what we see on screen.  Ultimately, it is that the story is emotionally hollow.  Nomi keeps insisting she is a dancer and not a whore, but it takes the entire film for her to learn these two things are not mutually exclusive.<br /> Besides the fact that we are supposed to root for the nobody to become somebody in stories like this, there is no reason to even feel sorry that Nomi does not understand this obvious point.  Our sympathies are more with her friend Molly (Gina Ravera), the costume designer, and James Smith (Glenn Plummer), the down on his luck dancer-choreographer, who cross Nomi's path.  The film ends in a series of melodramatic showdowns at odds with the rest of the film and the final scene provokes the sudden suspicion that \\"Showgirls\\" was all one big joke.  But maybe the fact that most likeable character in the film was stripper comedian Henrietta Bazoon (Lin Tucci) was a big clue.  Then again, maybe there is not more here than meets the eye; maybe there is less.lummer), the down on his luck dancer-choreographer, who cross Nomi's path.

If you like adventure and surprises, this is a book for you. Simpson puts you on the edge of your seat guessing what's going to happen next.
B00005221M|5.0|While the story deviates a bit from the classic literature, this film is simply a must-have for any DVD collection.  It has it all; action romance, heroes, bad guys... One could want for little more in what has become for my wife and me, a great Sunday afternoon movie.
B00005176F|5.0|Blur is by far one of the most interesting bands to come from England, definately the most original. This collection is a must have for old and new fans alike, as it is an excellent representation of their career. Starting off with two big hits, &quot;Beetlebum&quot; and &quot;Song 2&quot;, which the latter has become one of their most recognizable songs and biggest hits. Of course there is the campy and fun songs like &quot;Parklife&quot;, &quot;Girls and Boys&quot;, &quot;Country House&quot; etc which have become fan favorites, along with the rest of the tracklisting. Some of my favorites include &quot;End of a Century&quot;, &quot;She's So High&quot;, &quot;On Your Own&quot; and &quot;There's No Other Way&quot;. Overall this brit bands music is compelling and worth well repeated listenings, so if you need a jumping point to get your introduction to Blur, this is a fine collection to do so.
B00007JVBI|5.0|it's been a long time since moon pix came out. i think some of us thought she may have slipped into a perpetual funk of depression, or anxiety, or her well-documented stagefright. you name it. so much of her personna is teetering on madness, i began to wonder where she was headed musically.<br />but today my worries we're blown out of the water upon the first listen of this new album. it is really a revelation! quite beautiful typically melancholy bluesy songs, but this time accompanied in some songs by some more layers, including some guest vocal action from ed vedder (from whats that band called?) and even a little dabble of electronica (by way of something out of 1985, mind you).<br />the first half is a little more uptempo and rocking, and then she slowly reverts back into her shell for some really mind-blowing sad songs near the end. the CD is worth the cash just for \\"fool,\\" which is probably the most beautiful song she has written to date, and also \\"speak to me,\\" which could easily sound like a song from someone less talented but more pop/rock-orientated like sheryl crow. but she really avoids any kind of cliche. the song has a multi-layered vocal track-throughout, with a really great and haunting piano sample.  check out the track \\"free\\" also, as it is one of the weirdest and most unlikely songs she has ever done (much like \\"american flag\\" on moon pix).<br />i have to say though, that her strongest work is painfully simple, usually just her soft strumming a guitar, and her famously disjointed and tearful voice slithering around. the warren ellis violin backdrop for the song \\"werewolf\\" is quite appropriate, adding just another layer of tearjerk to her patented blend of blues chanteuse.<br />it is really just a great album...there's no way around it. if only more musicians can be so invested in their craft. we should be happy to have the few chan marshalls out there that there are. she is a true artist and goddamned original.
B00005JM1D|3.0|It seems that every few years we see the release of a fraternity farce with plenty of ridiculous moments, lame jokes and inevitable scenes of nudity. We've seen Animal House and Porky's and Old School continues the tradition. There is a slight variance to the theme here because the group of kooky guys running things aren't actually college students but older men who relive their youth.<br />The fun's kicked off when Mitch (Luke Wilson) comes home to find his wife (Juliette Lewis) in a rather unique compromising position. He leaves and restarts life in a house near the local college. Pretty soon he has regular guests in friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank \\"the Tank\\" (Will Ferrell). The obvious way to celebrate Mitch's freedom and their proximity to the college is to establish a fraternity. And so the clichéd hilarity begins.<br />It's really a modern day Animal House, right down to it's own ex-SNL actor in Will Ferrell who, incidentally is the stand-out performer and who you get to see a real lot of...<br />You know what to expect when going in to see Old School and, if you've seen the earlier iterations mentioned above (and you were rolling on the floor helplessly, then) then you will probably love this one too. Endless one-liners, some great physical humour and a cameo or two is what you'll be in for.

I won't go into a plot summary because that's been covered pretty well here, but I laughed out loud in many places in the film.  It is a subtle film of laughter and tears set in Regency England.

It's one I can watch over and over.  The soundtrack is fun, the characters are likable and well-acted, and the movie is a keeper!  You won't be disappointed.

6304712936|5.0|This was an amazing movie, and I can not remember one point in the movie where I wanted it to be over.<br />First off, Tom Hulce plays the vulgar W. A. Mozart so perfectly you forget that he's even acting it out.  He acts so much like he is actually the real musical genius, it's amazing.  He portrays Mozart much like I actually pictured the man: very energetic.  The way he conducts sometimes shows how energetic Mozart actually was in life.<br />The loving wife of Mozart, Contanze, or \\"Stanzi,\\" is played by Elizabeth Berridge.  She is a very loving, yet sometimes rude and angry, woman, who is introduced as his fiancee at the production of the opera \\"The Abduction of the Seraglio.\\"  This gets him into a lot of trouble with the woman who thought Mozart loved her.  The emporer finally suggests that the two marry, and eventually, they do.<br />The academy-award winning performance of F. Murray Abraham as Saliere was astounding and spooky beyond all reason.  His performance is filled with hate, the way the performance should be.  He is amazingly realistic when he starts saying that God is his worst enemy.  His portrayal of Salieri should give you the Flibbertywiggymigs, and if not, there is probably something wrong with you.  Later in the movie, he comes to the dying Mozart in a costume that his dead father had worn to a party, and commissions a Requiem from the man, so that Salieri can proclaim that it is his own work and say that he wrote it for Mozart.<br />The comical emperor Joseph is acted out by Jeffrey Jones.  Well, there it is.  He is extraordinary as the tone-deaf piano-playing ruler of Italy.  A nice touch it is when he recalls the incident with young Mozart, about 7, proposes to his sister Antoinette.  He talks about Antoinette at intervals throughout the movie, and his performance is quite enjoyable.<br />An honorary mention would be the parody actor, who commissions a fantasy opera, \\"The Magic Flute,\\" from Mozart.<br />Granted, I did not see the R-rated version.  I saw the original PG-rated version.  But it was still one of the greatest movies in movie history.<br />I would recommend this for ages 11 and up.  It is rated PG for harsh language, mostly.  The R-rated version is rated R for brief nudity, but again, I will say that I have not seen it.<br />This is a full recommendation!  It is a five-star movie without a doubt.  You must see this!  If you don't like it (which I doubt) then don't listen to my other reviews because this is the kind of movie that I like.<br />Well, I've said a mouthful.  Goodbye.
B000002UTO|5.0|I have to admit I was put off by the album Notorious when it initially came out. My favorite group of the time had broken up and taken a new musical direction. This, even though I LOVED Arcadia's So Red The Rose. Then Big Thing came out, and Duran Duran were no longer in vogue. They started to be relegated to bargain bin memorabilia of teeny-bopper days-gone-by. And that was despite the fact that their music was growing up. <br />In retrospect and upon recent return listening, Notorious is a fabulous album. But I could never understand for the life of me why Big Thing was not greeted with open arms by fans and media-outlets everywhere. It seems evident to me that in the late '80s, Duran Duran were the victims of backlash for the frenzy they created in the first half of the decade. It was suddenly cool and fun to hate them and it was quite easy to be laughed at for still being a fan. They had no obvious political agenda and were not Underground or Indie, and so by virtue of the times Duran Duran were out. They were has-beens.<br />Big Thing to me is like two incredible albums. There's a great club EP in here on the first half, with Big Thing, I Don't Want Your Love, All She Wants Is and Drug. Then there's a thoughtful, deeply layered, well-conceived and fascinating second half featuring experimental work and really wonderful song writing both lyrically and musically that takes you to a different place altogether. <br />Palomino, Land, The Edge of America and Lake Shore Driving are some of the best work Duran Duran has and will ever do. The biggest difference between this and most of what Duran Duran is known for is that none of these are radio-friendly, single-type songs. It's to LeBon and Rhode's credit that on an album with such strong singles as All She Wants Is and I Don't Want Your Love, the album they were from really shines in the non-single cuts. Big Thing shouldn't be ignored, it should be embraced.
B000069AUI|4.0|On their second release, Coldplay mine similar territory to their first album, Parachutes. Somber, minor-key songs abound, featuring Chris Martin's falsetto (the only comparison I can hear to Radiohead is the similarity of Martin's and Thom Yorke's voices) and a web of Buckmaster's guitars.<BR>Like their first album, Coldplay show a nack of being genuinely emotionally affecting, despite often pithy lyrics. Rather than making grand statements, individual lyrics tug your heart strings - from the encouraging sentiments of &quot;Amsterdam&quot; to Martin's choked pleads on &quot;In My Place&quot;. <BR>As mentioned in other reviews, Coldplay have not mastered the talent of consistently writing memorable hooks. As a result, these pop songs can meander a bit at times. This, however, is a minor point when coupled with the raw nerve that Chris Martin seems to display in his vocals. Overall, a very good album.
B00004Z459|3.0|I bought this album when &quot;One step closer&quot; was the hit on the album.I loved the album and it was great.But as they started gaining popularity,their songs started coming on radio.And they were played over and over and over..........which is why they released the album &quot;Reanimation&quot;.That was a good album,because they took the hits off of this album and remixed them.But after more radio play I got disgusted with this album and &quot;Reanimation&quot;.To sum it all up,this is a good album,but after listening to the CD twice,you`ll get sick of the so-called music(annoying DJ noises) and wish for your money back,so its better to download or get this album burned.And if there new album has similar sound to this album,I guarantee that nobody will know who Linkin Park is after this year.
B0000026DJ|4.0|The only reason I can't give the album 5 stars is because it is so very topical and political (for Australia) that little old me, sitting in America, is most assuredly missing many of the themes, jabs, ironic points, political barbs, etc. that Midnight Oil is tossing out.  That keeps the songs from being timeless classics for me.  In general, the album appears to explore the conflict between &quot;the colonials&quot; or &quot;white&quot; folks of Australia, destroying the land and the culture of the &quot;natives.&quot;  Americans can certainly relate to a lot of that.  We get a real sense of the great barren vastness of Australia, and the songs are packed with images of nature.  I don't know if you can call it a concept album, but thematically, it is extremely tight.<br />But these guys certainly do rock, and they do so with great passion.  Peter Garrett more than makes up for his lack of technical vocal skills with a unique, gravelly passion.  (If you ever saw these guys live, you know what a manic performer Garrett was...and riveting!).  <br />The songs that rock hard are still extremely melodic.  Midnight Oil is one of those rare bands where the songs are immediately catchy.  They don't need to grow on you, they grab your right away.  BEDS ARE BURNING is a classic.  From the opening bass notes, the song grabs you and doesn't let go.  WAREKURNA, BULL ROARERS and SOMETIMES are in the same ilk.  In fact, SOMETIMES is one of the great albums closers of any album I've ever listened to.  You just want to go right back to the beginning and jam some more.<br />Oil has some &quot;gentler&quot; songs as well, including the hit, mid-tempo DEAD HEART, which is a very effective song.  ARTIC WORLD is very slow, melodic and moody.<br />These guys are always solid, and this album (as well as the lesser known EARTH AND SUN AND MOON) are the best examples of their song craftsmanship, political sensibilities and rockin' attitude.  In my opinion, this album is a MUST OWN!!
B00005JLXC|5.0|I just saw the movie tonight and I must say, while I did enjoy the film in many aspects and I think it's EXTREMELY well done, the movie has a very dark and quite morbid tone.  And I'm not saying that this kind of movie is not a crowd pleaser, but it's definitely not what I expected.  There are no shiny bright happy moments and cute little plot twists or such.  This is NOT in any way shape or form \\"Spiderman.\\"  \\"Spiderman\\" was fun-loving and happy bright colors and funny humor all the way.  In fact, I'd even go as far to say that it's quite \\"adult.\\"  Now, a couple of kids were sitting behind me and they couldn't stop making exciting action comments and after the movie they trailed away non-stop talking about the movie.  So I'm sure kids will love it.  But as I said, it's quite dark.  Oh, and by the way, a someone dies early in the film and that's very sad for the audience because we really liked this character (this event alone makes up most of the morbidity of the film).<br />Now, onto the actual production aspects.  The concept of this computer-generated sense of hearing/sonar deal was done MASTERFULLY.  And there's also the matter of the costume.  The Daredevil costume looks SOO ugly.  It's on my top ugly super-hero outfits list.  And I'm sure it was hot and uncomfortable as anything.  Especially his legs; they look the worst.  Colin Ferrel is SOOO good.  He's really amazing in this role.  I mean REALLY!  He should receive some kind of award for this; and it's a shame because the big awards are very rarely ever given to actors in Superhero flicks.  Between his costuming and this cool motorcycle he's so cool.  He has such incredible energy and flair for this role.  You can tell that he's really taken this seriously.  Jennifer Garner, another amazing visual sight.  They have her with this long curly hair and these tight cute outfits and she's SO naturally beautiful.  There's this fun fight scene between Murdock and Electra that's just wonderful.  It's the only \\"fun\\"scene in the movie.  There's nothing really terribly exciting about Affleck's performance.  In fact, I think another actor might have improved the film.  Now, don't get me wrong, he was very good and very dedicated.  But I think maybe someone a little smaller.  Also, Affleck is a very large man.  He's gigantic.  He's too big.  No one is that big.  Especially a super-hero.  They're all normal sized.  He's so large that he's almost clumsy.  And it also occured to me that I'm sure all of these wonderful back-flips and stuff are done by a stunt double.  Do I care?  Yeah I kinda do.  Was there no athletic agile actor that who we can at least think he did most of his own stunts?  That's movie magic too.  I'm sorry to be a Ben Affleck basher.  He's actually one of my very favorite actors in Hollywood.  But the role just left more to be desired.  Michael Clark Duncan as the Kingpin is so fun.  He's large and in-charge!  <br /> I would kill to see a Daredevil/Spiderman combo movie.  And that's not such a bad idea.  Don't they meet in the comic books?  I believe they find out each other's identities and stuff.  That would be sooo cool.  They should actually do that!  A Tobey Miguire Ben Affleck flick.  They'd probably make it bad though.  They always do that when it's exciting like that.   <br />The film really is very good. It's extremely accurate and sure not to let fans down (unlike X-men -- DOCTOR Jean Grey?  The messed-up Rogue story? hello?!!)  Daredevil is definitely worth seeing.  When it comes out on video I'm definitely renting, if not buying.
B00005JLXC|4.0|No, it's not as good as Tim Burton's Batman, nor the original Superman or the recent Spiderman movies. But Daredevil still is a good comic book film that wins much of my praise by being true to the page in creating a very dark character in a harsh world<br />Still, it is not without its flaws, and if it weren't for some very unique traits I would rate this film as only mediocre. But what works here works exceptionally well. Beginning with the traditional origin story of Daredevil (Ben Affleck), a blind superhero whose remaining senses are greatly heightened, the movie shows how he became a vengeful vigilante who kills the bad guys rather then turning them in to face a potentially corrupt court system (Daredevil's alter ego Matt Murdock is a lawyer by day). This world is mean, and so is its superhero. But he wrestles with his conscious and wonders if he is a bad guy too. In this comic book world, people die. Including those you don't expect to. In other words, it more accurately depicts real life while still in a superhero world.<br />One particular unique thing about the film is how it illustrates Daredevil's radar sense. The vibrations he picks up are shown in a fantastic visual effect that has to be one of the best film realizations of a superpower in history. From the origin scene when he goes blind to a wonderful scene with Elecktra in the rain where he first \\"sees\\" what she looks like from the drops of rain on her face, the technique is used for characterization and \\"film moments,\\" and never just to show off a cool special effect.<br />Unfortunately, the movie isn't perfect. There isn't enough development of Elecktra and Daredevil's relationship, and bad guy Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan) doesn't have enough screentime to villainify his presence. All the characters could have benefited from further characterization as well. But this is a comic book movie, after all, and in the end what matters most is how much fun it was. And Daredevil is a blast.
B0000640S2|2.0|This is a sequal that isnt bad, but wasnt done perfectly. The first movie \\"first blood\\" was so great that it deserves a perfect sequal, but this film was not. If I had my way, I would have done a prequal that showed Rambo and his military buddies during Vietnam and some of the problems he faced from American Society when he returned. This sequal however has Rambo returning to Vietnam to look for and rescue missing POWs. The premise wasnt that bad, and missing POWs in Vietnam is a very real and scary issue that alot of people today forget or dont know about. This movie just went to over the top and was far from realistic or meaningful like \\"first blood\\". It shows vietnam soldiers who seem like they are still in Vietnam war mode even 15 years later like they have nothing better to do. Somehow the Russians get thrown into the mix and the movie makes even less sense(obviously a cheap patriotic ploy during the coldwar era). Im actually suprised they didnt have the Iranians join the fight against Rambo.<br />  Lets be honest; this film ruined the true meaning and greatness of \\"first blood\\". Looking back, there is no denying that \\"first blood\\" is still an amazing movie with meaning and stirs emotion to this very day. Rambo 2 took away from a truly great film \\"first blood\\" and turned Rambo into a killing machine. The only reason Rambo went into kill mode in the first film was because he was pushed too far. He was a man who lost his friends in battle and sense of home/belonging. He did everything he could do to evade violence and go his own way, but he was pushed around too far and too many times. In the sequal \\"Rambo 2\\", he is hardly even the same character. Still, I can see how some people could like the movie and it almost gets 3 stars for the great action. You may dissagree with me, but there is a reason why \\"First blood\\" cost more to buy then Rambo 2 and 3.<br />  The Extra features in this DVD are pretty good. There is a documentary on the Rambo series and you get commentary from director George Cosmatos(but no Stallone commentary).ary from director George Cosmatos(but no Stallone commentary).
B00003CWTI|5.0|I'm not naive. I'm not unrealistic. I'm tedious and overly critical when I watch films, looking and searching for flaws and agendas. This film, this Magnolia, was a piece of heavenly humanity on film. We see a number of seemingly all-together folks who need SOMETHING in all their lives to fill their various voids, their pains, their yearnings. This something comes together in many realistic ways but under the umbrella of a miraculous event at the end of the film.<br />Each character has demons to answer to in this movie. For one man, his grievances come in the form of pushy parents who took his boyhood by making him focus singularly on winning a boy genius competion. Years later, when he is grown, another young boy must grow through the process of a selfishly pushy father who is always makes sure to say, \\"I love you\\" whenever talking to his son, even if his actions say otherwise.<br />There is a woman who's married a man for his money but later falls in love with him as he dies of cancer in his living room. The man's son, Tom Cruise, is living with his own pitfalls and attempts harboring his pain by playing the daily role of a extremely confident sex guru. \\"Tame her\\" is his theme and his following involves thousands of men with voids themselves.<br />There is a Christian cop who has the heart of a lamb but the insecurities of a psych patient. He falls for a crack-head who has ancient scars of her own to deal with. It is their relationship, in my opinion, that steals the show.<br />There are others, of course; a talk show host who has three months to live; a compassionate male nurse who attempts the reuniting of two bitterly astranged family members; a young black boy who - for the briefest of moments - manages to steal our hearts in a handsome display of well-being for his fellow man.  Despite their confident smiles and tones, each person in this film is deeply frail. Each wanders aimlessly through stormy torments but, luckily for all of them, hope and resolution rises firmly on the horizon.<br />A stirring film with raw emotion and deep compassion. This film has plenty of vulgarities so be warned; however, without some of it, the truly humanistic style would fail to be portrayed. WATCH THIS FILM!! Engrossing, intriguing, thought-provoking and beautifully graceful, Magnolia is an emotional powerful film if there ever was one.<br />The acting in this film is TOP NOTCH and so if the music.

B000070WJE|2.0|To me, a longtime fan of Sir Robert, I think this record is a big let down. The jokes are getting a bit old and the music isn't as catchy or fun either. It's not all bad though, the single \\"Feel\\" is very good, on par with his best work. I also liked the classic Robbie sound of Sexed Up and Monsoon. Escapology has it's moments, but they are too far and few to make up for the weak points.<br />But the rest of the disc goes way downhill. the biggest misfire on the album comes in at song number 10, \\"Me and My Monkey\\", it is seven grueling minutes about a talking ape and Robbie going to Vegas to look for hookers and cash. The entire song is done in a latin/western vibe as well, and it's just a bad tune from Sir Rob. The rest of the record isn't quite as bad as that moment, but it isn't much better either. The whole lot suffers from over-production and bad puns that wear off after a second listen. Cursed and Song 3 (terrible title) grow way too old before their time and stuff like Love Somebody lacks any of the catchy punch found on previous records.<br />So, is this the 80 million dollar hit machine EMI is banking on? Maybe, but not quite yet. I suggest getting I've been Expecting you or even the domestic The Ego Is Landed.
B000002KDX|5.0|Ever since the first notes to \\"Horse with no name\\" came across the radio, I've been hooked ever since.  Even now, listening to Gerry and Dewey and Dan harmonize on this CD makes me think back to those young carefree days of sun tanning and swimming with friends!
B000002NJS|5.0|It's the kind music that is both easy listening and unique to me. And almost five years passed, it is still refreshing.
B00006CXSS|2.0|This DVD is another typical american war- story were american soldiers defeat their enemy. Other features in this series are Panther tanks (Best tank of WWII) that doesn't fire when confronted with Shermans, and therefore are blown sky high. A few evil germans who flee as soon as they see a US- soldier are also added, as usual. The americans never loose a scirmish, in the end they are always saved by someone or something. So to sum this up: This DVD- box is a must for those of you who love seeing americans killing germans and looting their pockets afterwards. It also features american soldiers executing lots of german POW's and of course no one is punished afterwards. If you like that, then this is the thing for you, for all of you who have seen american war- movies in the past, stay away, you have seen it all before.

0066214122|5.0|Michael Crichton's new novel reminds me somewhat of his earlier work Jurassic Park . This is a compliment. Jurassic Park is perhaps Crichton's best novel. In many ways, Prey is quite similar. Substitute dinosaurs for nanomachines, and you've got a storyline that is very close to that of Jurassic Park . That's okay, Jurassic Park was a very strong and interesting book.<br />Crichton is very good at presenting complex theoretical science in a way that is both understandable (in a very rough form) as well as believable. While we may not be close to being able to achieve the science in Crichton's novels, he makes us believe that perhaps it is possible, at least for the length of a novel. In that, he is a very successful writer.<br />The basic story is that nano-machines are possible and after years of the theory being discussed, one company has actually created them. As each individual nano-machine is smaller than dust, they are designed to travel through veins and transmit images of what they see. Jack is the narrator, he is unemployed having been fired from his software job for whistle-blowing (a co-worker was selling company secrets, but the boss was in on it). Jack's wife works for the company making the nano-machines. He suspects that she is cheating on him. A swarm of nano-machines has gotten free from the laboratory and is potentially a danger. Strange things are beginning to happen at Jack's house.<br />A very interesting and well told story. It is fast paced and I didn't want to put the book down. Recommended.
B00005LC4G|4.0|Who could forget precious memories from CP2- the teacher ruler bashing scene, or the painful 'dad on the stairs scene' I was totally blown away by these movies when i was a kid and still love them today.<br />Bride of chucky is the best, being the most dark, gothic and edgy out of all the CP movies.<br />If you like good horror movie classics, or just want to see a doll trying to kill a little kid (or two dolls having sex, as in the cas of BOC) you have to get this collection. Commentaries on the BOC disk are fascinating.<br />I only have to grumble about the lack of features on the CP2 disk, thats why im giving it 4/5
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Why would I call this review a \\"real\\" five-star recording?  Well, I think we all know the Amazon.com Customer Review drill here, do we not?  For the benefit of those who might not be familiar with it, allow me to present a step-by-step description.  Step 1: A starry-eyed, mega-fan of a group or artist gives everything that group or artist does five stars regardless of the recordings' actual quality.  Step 2: A real music fan (who might or might not be a fan of the group or artist in question) gives the recording a good listen or two, then sits down and writes a thoughtful, accurate review of it giving it the one to three stars that it actually deserves.  Step 3: The same starry-eyed, mega-fan who freely gives the five-star ace claims that the accurate review was \\"not helpfull\\" to him or her.  This is quite frustrating, isn't it?  I mean honestly folks, it's a one-question survey, it shouldn't be so hard to understand!  The fact that you don't agree with a review should not mean that it was not \\"helpfull\\".    Anyway, with all that said (and thank you for bearing with me), Simon & Garfunkel's 1970 swan song is a true five-star recording.  Which, as far as I'm concerned, was new territory for S & G.  The duo's 1960's albums were true to the 1960's format for LP's:  a few obvious hit singles and the rest filler.  Thank God for the Beach Boy's Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper, which created the \\"LP as an art-form\\".  With the exception of the duo's first folkie recording, Wednesday Morning, 3 AM (which I would give a solid four stars), Bridge Over Troubled Water was the first of S & G's albums not to follow that lame 1960's format and their only five-star acing.    As mentioned several times by many reviewers, the album spawned four top 40 singles.  The most popular of those was the title track.  Now I have heard criticisms of this song ranging from it being \\"melodramatic\\" or \\"sappy\\" to it becoming a musical cliche.  I just do not see or hear it that way at all.  All I can see and hear is a heavenly lead vocal (by Art), masterful song writing (by Paul) and a flawless gospel piano accompaniment (by Larry Knechtel), which combined, creates a true masterpiece.  El Condor Pasa which was a Paul Simon reworking of a South American folk song and Cecilia with its Caribbean rhythms offer a preview of Paul's \\"world music\\" solo career with stunning results.  The Boxer is the favorite of so many or so many good reasons.  The song cleverly uses the beating a boxer usually receives in the ring as a metaphor to the rough life experienced by a young man who relocates to New York, the big city of dreams.  The triumphant ending still sends a shiver up my spine after all these years.  The live version of this tune found on The Concert in Central Park includes a verse left off of this album's original version.  Though the verse does not add much to the song, the audiences' reaction to it makes it worth that album's price of admission alone.  Powerful stuff indeed.      For me, this album's real charms are the strong non-singles that more than hold their own against their four more popular counter-parts mentioned above.  Baby Driver and (moreover) Keep The Customer Satisfied are the album's cool horn-driven rockers.  With So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright and (moreover) The Only Living Boy in New York, Paul Simon offers a few mellow introspective looks at his inevitable parting of ways with his more charismatic partner.  Why Don't You Write Me is a preview of what Simon would perfect a few years later with his solo hit Mother and Child Reunion.  The ill advised cover of the Everly Brothers Bye Bye Love complete with what sounds like a phony live backing track does not throw things off too much.  S & G started out as an Everly Brothers-influenced duo as teenagers in the late 1950's, so this cover can be seen as a bridge to those more innocent times.  Song For The Asking ends this great effort (in its original format) on a short but sweet note.      Though Paul Simon and (to a lesser extent) Art Garfunkel enjoyed solo success, neither of their collective solo albums topped the greatness of this effort (grant it, some might argue with me sighting Simon's 1986 album Graceland).  Though I was only four years old at the time of this LP's release, I was fortunate enough to have a mom who literally played her copy to death.  I bought my own vinyl copy many years ago, and this was one of my very first CD purchases.  Obviously this recording has had a huge impact on my life.  Fortunately I was lucky enough to personally thank Art Garfunkel for this great music a few days ago after his fine performance here in Buffalo.  Though I will probably never get to meet Paul Simon, I would like to thank him as well here on Amazon.com  fpr.
B000065V1V|4.0|a co worker lent this to me.  she said she thought it was junk.  she could not be more wrong.  in my opinion, bowie has returned to a more traditional rock approach.  there is not the electronic-ness of &quot;im afraid of americans&quot; or the mellow-ness of HOURS.  bowie presents us with a more middle of the road rock record with some enhancements both electronic as well as musical.  <BR>     the songs are strong although i found a few fell flat but for the most part, this is a well crafted and great sounding record.  this is one of bowie's best.
B000088E6D|5.0|thank god for my computer. I can hear Michaels cd all the time until good old canada gets them in. Hoping that will be soon,they say next week.I have to let everyone know that Michael is not only gorgeous,he's alive when he sings,he can make your world rock.Even when you think nothing can help.And to hear the Bee Gees singing backup for Michael on their own song,(well what does that tell you) the Bee Gees don't just let anyone sing their music.Here we have a Vancouver boy, and Paul Anka, David Foster, Bruce Allen, the Bee Gees   ect... who also think he,s out of this world.Well I would like to thank Michael for having a great voice and bringing this music back to life. Can't wait to see you in concert again , you are going to have a #1 cd.And us Vancouverites can say we've seen him in concert before anyone in this world. I have followed you around, in concerts, at the PNE, at the movies,on radio, resaurants ect... I guess you can call me a groupy. I hope as soon as everyone hears the cd they will feel the same as me.  All the best to Michael Buble
B0000028M7|5.0|during the 90's seattle was to rock what bethlehem was to christianity and it was the best music ever.  it saved rock for the 90' and dominated the charts for a decade.  this is one of many albums i would call a masterpiece.  the depression, the anger, the misery all bleed through in the music.  dark, brooding, eerie music that screams to be saved or killed.  and thats before layne starts singing.  the lyrics are either about drugs, depression, anger or some other form of madness that makes this a collosal album and a must have.<br />  this album is heavier than anything AIC put out before or after.  the lyrics paint wonderfully bleak pictures and the music just plain rocks.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I must say that it is absolutely true that music transcends race, color sex, everything. Music should bring you untold pleasure, transport you to another world on a fantasic voyage of sorts.  And that's what I feel when I listen to music. I feel music so deep within my soul. I must say that being a black woman, much of the music I listen to is well, by african americans, not by choice, but because I love music so much and want songs that move me or that I can relate to in some way.  I mean there are some really great artisit out there who are not african american, I just never gave them a chance.<br /><br />Until.....<br /><br />One day I was flipping through the TV channels and came across your body is a wonderland, by John Mayer, I wish I could say it was love at first listening, but it wasn't, it was okay. But the more I saw the video, the more I started to listen to the song, the more I loved it. I started to want more John Mayer.  He has a soulful, powerful voice that moves you and takes you to the place he's singing from.  The music, the music, the MUSIC!!!, touches you, it makes you seek out the words to the song. You find the common ground with his music and realize that we really are not all that different after all. It's about our own individual interpretations.<br /><br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM!!
B000002B2X|5.0|released before dirt and after facelift, this album was a sleeper hit. the reason for this is because no one knew it was out. i went to the record store and there was this AIC album i never saw before. already knowing(& loving) facelift, i picked it up.<br /> the band wanted to experiment so there was no promotion for this album. it blew up due to word of mouth. filled with guest appeareances from chris cornell, members of heart and mark arm of mudhoney, this album is acoustic and quiet in a somber way.<br /> this is one tremendous and eerie album. slow bass lines, guitar added more to spice things up than anything, laid back drums at times all give this album such a great vibe. layne's voice sounds great as always. only 5 songs long, it is almost mandatory you get this if your a self respecting rock fan.
B0000214F0|4.0|While the plot was somewhat lacking, you couldn't ask for more steam to be generated by a non-pornographic movie.  As a woman nearing middle age, and a rather conservative woman at that, I can say that I was flushed and stimulated by the time the movie finished.  The \\"name\\" actors legitimize the movie, but the \\"adult film\\" actors give the movie it's zest.  I watched the film by myself, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.  I was able to fully devote my attention to it, shall we say.  One scene between two female lovers was so exquisitely executed, it literally took my breath away.<br />Truly a film intended for mature audiences.
B00000272N|4.0|AIC are one of the finest bands ever!!  this is one killer album.  with hits like sea of sorrow and man in the box AIC deliver in a truly amazing way.  i adore their sound.  so grungy, thick and crunchy.  great rhythm section and the fact that layne is dead is, in its own way, as monumental a loss to music as kurdt.<BR>      i think the best song has to be &quot;it aint like that&quot;  such a groove (although AIC are all about bottom end and groove) and there are not enough adjectives to describe the wicked guitar playing from mr cantrell.  only dirt (and maybe sap) outshine this one but like the title says...THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGGINNING
6300182266|4.0|When Battlestar Galactica premiered in 1978, I was still 2 years from birth.  Since I had never had the Sci-Fi Channel, I first became aquainted with the series in 1997 when I was in Media Play in the Sci-Fi section.<BR>I have always been a huge fan of Star Trek, and a big fan of Star Wars, but I was looking for something to expand my universe.  I saw several films, but for some reason I picked up this video and read the back cover--and I was hooked.  I immediately went to the checkstand and bought it.  I took it home and watched it with my 8-year-old brother, and from then on it has been his favorite show.<BR>The video was excellent and I have since bought several other Battlestar Galactica videos and books.  I recently noticed that this video is now on DVD, and I hope that the entire series will also be released on DVD.
B00004Y5A8|5.0|Disc 2 really kooks (!) This is rock'n'roll at it's best. Mick Ronson's guitar shines through the way it never did on the Ziggy Stardust studio album. Check out Hang On To Yourself. But disc 1 isn't bad. It kind of grows on me. I feel I'm ready to check out Bowie's earlier catalog. I consider myself a Bowie fan although not a hardcore one. The albums Hunky Dory and Scary Monsters are some of my all time favourites. I will now add Bowie At The Beeb to that list.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp: excellent. Ray Liotta: not convincing as Jung's father.  Penelope Cruz: tiresome. The score: rocks. Editing: moves the story along, truly good. Subject matter: well-worn. Main character narration: been there, done that. Throw all the elements of Blow into a bowl, mix and pour, and you've got a very, very good movie. Not the best -- Goodfellas wins that prize for this type of film -- not the worst, and not even \\"just fair.\\" But good. I sat down to watch it, skeptical at first. But as soon as the opening tune began and the narration kicked in -- done before in other films or not -- I was hooked and pleasantly surprised.  So, he's a drug dealer. But he's well-played by Depp and his story is one of regret. Though many reviewers didn't feel for the guy at all, I did. The story is about drugs. Not exactly the Brady Bunch. But far more interesting.

B00005JLXC|5.0|Daredevil was a very good movie. It was a different type of superhero movie. Instead of relying on just special effects,-- don't misunderstand me; it had a lot of action-- it was also character-driven. Unlike \\"Spider-man,\\" which I happend to like, and other recent comic-book movies, we got to know the characters. Daredevil was also reminiscent of the first \\"Batman\\" in its dark tones. The movie also had really good acting, which is rare in most big-budget action movies. As in all the other superhero movies, the bad guy stole the show-- this time the culprit was Bullseye, played by Colin Farrel. Ben Affleck did a good job, too; I was skeptical about him, but he was actually good. Jennifer Garner was also good--then again, is there anything bad about her? The movie also had some very funny lines, most of which came from the banter between Ben Affleck's character and John Favreau's character.<BR>  This movie is perfect for men and women; it has both Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck. Definitely go see this movie for action, wittiness, and romance.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie after playing the playstation game,<BR>this DVD is absolutely crystal clear and beautiful as is the soundtrack.  The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed watching the very well dressed but incredibly stupid special hit team get their collective butts kicked by zombies and monsters.<BR>I am retired special forces and watching small units in military action in both war and horror can be a hoot.  I found Michelle <BR>Rodriguez to be disgusting in her cheap imitation of that incredibly ugly rapper ICE T. She continually tried to look out<BR>the top of her eyes while tilting her head down while scrunching<BR>her face up like ICE T.  She tried talking like him, and rolling<BR>her head around like him, and tried to be so macho while failing<BR>miserably.  She was uncontrollable and left the unit at times to<BR>solo recon which is a cardinal no-no in that type of situation.<BR>Aside from that this movie is a one dam good zombie stomping movie and the end leaves you dying for the sequel which is coming<BR>in 2004.  I highly recommend this movie to any horror buff who<BR>likes a well made movie.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This movie was phenomenal...It gave me a rare feeling that I only get from seeing a really great movie. Having seen the show on Broadway this past November, I was anticipating a really great movie. I was hoping the movie would fill in holes that a stage show could not-- and it did. Not only did \\"Chicago\\" more than meet my expectations, it trounced the Broadway show; it just seemed to fit better on a movie-screen. Having said that, it still felt a little like watching a stage show; such as, after each solo, I felt like clapping-- Of course, I didn't; those are the people I make fun of. <BR>  The performances were incredible. Catherine Zeta Jones was excellent; she not only played the part too the fullest, but she also looked as though she was having a good time. Renne Zellweger was amazing; having not known her to have had a dancing or singing backround, she must have worked really hard. Oddly enough, Queen Latifah was really good...but now that I think about it, her being good isn't that odd; the role really fits her. John C. Reily was also very good, as he was in all of his other roles in every really good movie this year. Richard Gere's performance was good but not great. His solos were definitely the weakest and everyone else outshined him.<BR>  The director did a great job, too; his eclectic shots were interesting too watch but not overused as some directors do.(Though Scorcesse, still deserves the Oscar.) The mood of the movie really helped in the enjoyment of it. <BR>  Trust me, see this movie!! You will not be sorry.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Just the first 20 or 30 seconds of the first track and I was in love with the sound of Ms. Jones' soothing voice.  Very cool.  This CD will be spinning for awhile in my player taking the place of Lateralus for the time being.....
B000002UAX|5.0|I probably can't say anything new about this album that has so much already written about it. However I'd venture to say that of all The Beatles albums ever released, this 2 disc set has the most variety of musical styles from the romantic pop of &quot;I Will&quot; to catchy sing-a-longs like &quot;Ob La Di, Ob La Da&quot; and &quot;Honey Pie&quot; to the earth shattering, guitar rockin' &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot; with Paul on the lead vocals. You'd almost think this would have been a John Lennon song!<br />All of the tracks on this album are outstanding including &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;Birthday,&quot; &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; and the really laid-back version of &quot;Revolution&quot; which I have come to like more than the one featured on the hit single.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This is the same Doulbe disk version of Live with all of the original songs but the difference is the GREATLY improved sound quality.  Great album then and even better now!  Go and buy this CD!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has managed to do what Britney failed to do, and that is to come back with a more mature album/sound that will appeal to a much bigger audience.  The first single(UK number 1) Dirty was an amazing tune.  The second single to be lifted from this album is Beautiful(my favourite) which is possibly the best song that she has done to date.  This album will more than appeal to th everyone who likes good music.  Well worth having this one in your collection.
0385335482|5.0|From the moment I picked this book up I could not put it down!  It was me!  I was reading about me!  Of course when I got deeper in I knew Becky had it WAY worse than I do!  But I reason every &quot;bargain&quot; and shop as a pick-me up.  I just felt myself relating to every word and just couldn't wait to find out what happened.  And I couldn't wait to read the next book to follow Beckys trials once again.  Fabulous book.  Could never say enough!  If you've ever gotten knots in your stomach over receiving your credit card bills you've gotta read this.  haha!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 Judgement Day is one of those rare films that not only is better then the original film,but one of those films that is so groundbraking that you'll remember it for a long time.While the original film is groundbraking in it's own right,the sequel is so much more.T2 like the first,starts off in the year 2029,where the Human Resistance and the machines of the future built by Skynet are still fighting.Again Skynet is trying to destory man's future by changing the past,but this time the target is not Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton),but the future leader of the Human Resistance,her son John(Edward Furlong).Skynet as made a new terminator call the T-1000(Robert Patrick)to kill young John Conner.As before,the Resistance sends a protector for John,but this time it's the Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger)itself.Even though T2 is now 13 years old,it can still wow you with the stunning special effects that people still talk about years later.T2 is a great film to watch over and over again and is my fifth favourite film ever made.Alot of the images of T2 are really hard to forget,like the destruction of L.A. on Aug 29 1997.The DVD is one of best DVDs you can buy,loaded with special features like \\"The Making Of T2\\",\\"T2 More Than Meets The Eye\\"and \\"The Making Of T2 3-D,teasers,trailers and what I think is awesome is you get two versions of T2,the original theatrical release or the special edition which you get the deleted scenes are put back in.I think that T2 is James Cameron's best film to date and like the first one,it makes us ask the question that the least person amongest us,could become the most important person in the future.

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now a headmistress of a California private school and she's having psychological problems. Her brother is in her nightmares and he's come back to pay his dear sister a visit. Those silly children should've gone to Yosemite. LL Cool J plays a security guard who cusses and writes poetry! Melodious! Why does the boyfriend always act tough in these kinds of movies, but never survives? This movie is a good sequel.
B00001NTXN|5.0|Quoridor is quite a bit of fun, particularly if you enjoy games that require more thinking, like Mastermind. Game time is short, so even young players can play and then play again without feeling like they're tied to a game of chess. The game does require some strategy-sense, so not sure if 8 and up is appropriate, maybe 12 and up. Adults will have the most fun however since you can easily play 4 or 5 games an hour.
0790751089|4.0|in a nutshell, <br />this is a movie about a bored, Italian woman who came to America expecting something bigger and better but instead she's stuck on a farming village without a career and building her life around her husband and kids..although her husband is not a bad person, she secretly wants more than a life on a farm amongst boring people who spends their time gossiping about nothing...she meets a man who seems to be the answer to her dull life..someone who is sensitive,travel the world, and lives the free lifestyle that she desires..of course divorce was more unacceptable back in 1965 then especially in the farming town of Madison County...Francesca is torn between keeping her family together and following her own dreams...<br />some people hate this movie because they simply look at it as two old people who are selfish and lack morals...i look at it differently...it's really about how women back then, sacrificed their happiness for their family because divorce was so out of the question
B00006HBUB|1.0|This movie was a terrible remake of a masterful cartoon series.<BR>The only character i actually liked in this movie was scooby-doo. The rest of the cast were awful. The cartoon series were made 30 years ago and they had a whole lot better script than this movie. Avoid it!
B000003TA4|3.0|In the time Nevermind was released, it was a good album, and arguably Nirvana's best. The best songs have decent melodies, although Cobain's lyrical shortcomings are in evidence on many cuts. Cobain had strengths and weaknesses as a songwriter. He had perhaps the best pop melodies out of the biggest rock bands beginning around this time( including Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden with a revamped lineup), but his lyrics were usually weak, not to mention extremely depressing. Maybe he would have gotten better had he lived longer.  The worthy hit Teen Spirit has become a classic despite it's half-baked words. It features a very catchy melody, along with a hard driving performance by the band. For rock fans, it must have been good hearing this in a time where very little of any value was inundating the airwaves. In Bloom was another highlight, with a more understandable chorus. For this reader, the song on the album that approaches highest overall quality is Come As You Are. It has Cobain's best and most understandable lyrics of his entire career. A lot of the other songs have a very ugly quality about them without saying anything meaningful. The only other true highlight would have to be Something In the Way, although the track should have ended at 1:50, not repeat the verse and chorus exactly with no difference. That made the recording repetitive. Overall, one of the best and most influential albums of the 90's, but this album is not a major classic. In 2001, VH1 rated Nevermind the second best album of all time. What a travesty! They were rating this higher than every album ever made other than one by the Beatles (Revolver), ranked over Sgt. Pepper, Pet Sounds, Are You Experienced, and Music From Big Pink to name only a few.  Even the biggest fans of Nirvana have to admit that is ludicrous. VH1 needs a good kick in the pants. Even though pop melodies were Cobain's strength, he was only good by 90's standards, which weren't as high as previous periods in rock history. Still, it is worth your time if this era interests you.
B00007H1Y2|2.0|Bummer!  I was really looking forward to this CD, based on reviews & interviews with Ry Cooder, but it's really a letdown.  Maybe the mambo has just been ruined for me by all of the imitators out there, but I didn't see much spark from this.  The day I got it I threw it on during a dinner party thinking it would be really cool & after a while we all just looked at each other and said \\"what is this?\\"... in a bad way.  Save your dollars... don't say you weren't warned!<BR>Enough with the embargo already!!!  Open up Cuba so we can hear more of the real stuff before it's too late...
B000002TYX|3.0|I must say that it was kinda disappointing. All the unfinished songs, were really unneccessary. But for a soft fan, I think it would be a nice CD to own.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Included on my list of \\"things I like\\" are \\"live action movies based on comic-book superheroes\\".  Well, this movie makes the cut.  Although I haven't been a big fan of either the Daredevil comic, Ben Affleck or Jennifer Garner, this movie didn't disappoint me.  It had all the elements of a comic book come to life on the big screen, including a star-crossed romance (think \\"Blade\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\").  And just as \\"Spider-Man\\" gave us a new perspective on Tobey Maguire, I now understand the sex symbol appeal of hunky Ben Affleck.  Go get 'em, tiger!  It's obvious Ben lost some weight and gained some muscle mass in all the right places, because he's doing that daredevil costume much justice in the movie.  Jennifer Garner's role as Elecktra needed a little polish, I thought, but her effort filled the requirement.  And frankly, I'd watch Michael Clarke Duncan do a Rice Krispies commercial.  That man can do no wrong!<br />I treated myself to the movie for  Valentine's Day and left the theater with a big smile on my face.  I will await the sequel patiently, and I will pay to see it too.
B000002TYX|3.0|Too much unneccessary unfinished songs. For a soft fan, maybe it would be nice.
0743455967|4.0|This book puts forth in clear terms how Stephen started his journey in writing, and goes on to suggest how to improve your own writing.  He gives nice examples and tips on what to do if you're starting out, both in presenting it to possible publishers and agents, and in just telling a good story.  The big secret King reveals; read a lot and write a lot.  This is the path to successful writing according to King, and great advice to anyone who wants to write, either for fun or for a profession.  I recommend this book for beginners in the popular fiction writing field.
B00005JLWN|5.0|this movie should'nt have been in limited release.   i tell all my friends about it and 2 this day they are telling all of there friends.  possibly the best of 2002.  this movie was not a matrix rip-off but just pure movie magic.   equilibrium has set the standard 4 action and sci-fi.   a must own dvd and u can take that 2 the bank!!!
0316666343|5.0|I thought the book was wonderful! I found myself reading it at every spare moment! It could just be the sap in my, but I really loved it. The only thing that was disapointing was the ending, but even that was a wonderful end to a spactatular book!

B000055ZB8|1.0|I purchased the Special Edition and the video was wonderful<BR>but the sound track was so bad that I could not watch the <BR>movie with it on.  If you are serious about buying a copy of<BR>this movie, find the Nosferatu web site first and read about<BR>the sound track that are in use.  The sound track on this <BR>recording sounds like a 1950's jazz track with a lot of <BR>brushed cymbals.  The Man With the Golden Arm is what comes to<BR>mind.

B000002WPI|5.0|Wu-Tang's 36 Chambers was one of the most greatest albums to grace us. The most innovative produciton, ive ever heard.. not often do you hear hip hop of similiarity and of course of as great quality. The beats were interesting and flowed nicely. Meshed well with the diverse and great voices of the 9 members that make up the Clan. Great CD, nothing else to say.
B000088E6D|5.0|How refreshing to hear a new artist that obviously cares about the quality of the songs he is singing.  His voice is rich, emotional and silky - gorgeous to listen to.  I will buy anything this young Canadian puts out!

0553381709|5.0|I have to say that this is by far the best fantasy series that I have ever read!  This book was the top of them all so far. The only dissapointing part was when it was over and I was left craving more! Even if you are not a fan of fantasy novels, pick up this series, it will blow you away.

0316921173|5.0|It is a daunting task to review this novel.  The text is 981 pages long and the end notes close to 100 pages long. The book is also quite heavy.  My almost continuous need to check these notes kept interrupting the flow of the novel, but necessarily filled in lots of the details of its characters' family backgrounds, historical facts and fictions, and Mr. Wallace's infinite knowledge of myriad pharmaceutical products mentioned in the novel.  _Infinite Jest_ is as complex and dense as it is entertaining, funny, horrifying, painful, bizarre, and at times graphically nauseating and hallucinatory.  <br />It is the Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment.  By the beginning of the 21st century time ceased to be designated chronologically, but began being named for well-known products on the market, e.g. Trial Size Dove Bar, etc.  The setting is the Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N. [ha, ha, ha]), no longer the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.  The big annual holiday celebration is Interdependence Day.  From time to time the book is populated by wheelchair bound, legless Quebecois terrorists who want Quebec to break away from O.N.A.N.  Their story, told in some detail, is extremely odd and mind boggling to say the least.<br />The cornerstone of the novel concerns the characters associated with Enfield Tennis Academy, a training school for young tennis prodigies.  The head was formerly the late James O. Incandenza (called \\"Himself\\" and \\"The Stork\\" by his sons), who also dabbled in experimental film making, his wife Avril (called \\"The Moms\\" by her sons), and their three sons, Orin (football star), Mario (a gentle dwarf and like his father, a film maker), and Hal (the youngest, but extraordinarily brilliant and drug addicted).  Some of Hal's descriptions of his late father's story are bizarre but incredibly funny!<br />In my opinion the hero of _Infinite Jest_ is Don Gately. He is a formerly heavily drug addicted, but currently seriously sober staff counselor at EnnetHouse, a residential home, near Boston, for individuals suffering from drug and alcohol problems.  Here is a man who formerly financed his habit through robbery, burglary, and other illegal money making schemes, who is justly beloved by Ennet House occupants.  Gately is the \\"Christ figure\\" of the book who suffers for the various transgressions of others.  Toward the end of the book a \\"victim\\" of one of Gately's past shennanigans pays tribute to him.<br />_Infinite Jest_ can be a slow read (it took me several months to complete the book) because in addition to its length it is rarely told in a conventional narrative form.  I also found myself at times zipping through all the strange, but delightfully recited situations and characterizations.  To be enjoyed one must be patient with it and allow oneself to go with its relentless flow.  If it is not already, _Infinite Jest_ is destined to become one of the world's great classics.
B000069HK2|5.0|I have been buying ALOT of new cds lately and I still go back to this one everytime....even though the leadsinger is famous as kelly's bf it doesn't matter b/c their music rocks hard!!! I love them....the screaming and singing is perfectly balanced and the melodies are great
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Coen Brothers made an instant classic. The dialogue, the charictors, the story line, it's all very, very funny. One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. An unusual role for Jeff Bridges, but no one else could do it like he does, he is the Dude. John Goodman could have his own movie with his charictor Walter. Steve Buscemi, Julian Moore, and the bad guy from Road House (can't remember his name) are also very funny.
B00007JVBI|5.0|Yeah! Chan Marshall just gets better and better. There's nothing new here, just a refinement of what's been going on before, and it's a beautiful, lie-back-and-soak-in-the-tub pleasure. Like a lot of very strong albums that've been coming out lately -- Good Morning Aztlan by Los Lobos, Sea Change by Beck, Nocturama by Nick Cave -- this is an effortless (though it took 5 years) synthesis of an artist's career -- with early angular, post-punk/grunge Cat Power stuff and later The Covers album stuff dripping like honey off the kitchen table after Nick Drake's arm knocked over the jar post his final anti-depressant binge. Real mellow without being boring fall-asleep-in-the-tub-and-drown mellow due to all the subtle craft put into each song.
B00006LI4S|5.0|This DVD is an absolute must have for any Pink Floyd or David Gilmore fan. It's awsome. Comfortably Numb is incredible! Shine On...is also mind blowing. Just get it! The crowd roaring in 5.1 Dolby Digital makes it a &quot;real&quot; experience.
B000001FTJ|5.0|i may be a die-hard metalhead who gets his kicks out of bands like Bloodbath and Cryptopsy, but there is no way i can deny the genious of tom waits. possibly the best lyricist in the music industry, he connects with you in a way few musicians can. songs like \\"shore leave\\" and \\"soldiers things\\" leave you in a state of awe; in fact all the songs on this album do. get this, then get \\"raindogs\\" and \\"bone machine\\". you wont regret it.
B00005JL78|5.0|Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell and Max Von-Sydow make great performances in this sci-fi thriller. Excellent action sequences, great story line, exciting chases and DTS digital surround sound. This looks and sounds great (for us Hi-Fi junkies).
B00007ELEL|5.0|The Coen's make it look easy. After seeing one of their films, you think to yourself: \\"why didn't I think of that?\\" It's brilliant how they do that, their grace and style is beyond belief and though their message can be foggy at times, it shows they're two of the most talented faces in the American movie industry.<br />Their new film, The Big Lebowski isn't as much a departure as a new angle. It feels different, looks different, sounds different (voicing 256 uses of the \\"f\\" word in 118 minutes), but in the end you know that it's a Coen movie. Not because it's weird, not because it's clever, but because it works, it's a movie perfectly sequentially pieced together, like no other.<br />Jeff Bridges plays Los Angeles slacker \\"The Dude\\", an inner-league bowler who's teammates (John Goodman as Walter and Steve Buscemi as Donny) are his best friends. After two small-time thugs urinate on his favorite rug that \\"tied the room together\\" after mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski (Dude's given name), a millionaire who's younger wife owes their mafia money, he decides to take it up with that same millionaire. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Lebowski's assistant (and somewhat manservant) who stands by The Dude while waiting for Lebowski in one of the most achingly funny scenes of the decade. He meets with him, in a bad conversation, in which The Dude walks out with one of Lebowski's rugs that he steals. Lebowski calls on The Dude again when his wife Bunny is kidnapped for ransom money and Dude is the only guy who can sit in as the bagman. <br />From there on it's a classic twisted Coen plot, with appearances by Julianne Moore, John Turturro and Peter Stormare. It goes off the charts, something that we should expect from every Coen plot but every time the film gets us so caught up in the story that we're still surprised at every risky weirdo plot twist.<br />Joel and Ethan write one of the best scripts of the year, helped tremendously by a perfectly cast repertoire of great actors and actresses. Roger Deakins cinematography doesn't hurt the overall package and editing by Roderick Jaynes, ha ha (really the Coen's) puts the finishing touched on an already excellent film. It's respectable raunch that doesn't feel guilty for being what it should be...hilarious. The Coen's live up to their expectations with yet another mind-blowing masterpiece.
B0000797IO|1.0|I bought this movie expecting to have a great time watching it.  The reviews plastered on the front cover rave about it, so I expected a great film.  What I got was the complete opposite.  This movie appalled me.  The fact that it was called &quot;The Best Movie Of The Year&quot; just goes to show that some of the movie critics have no idea what they are talking about.  The accents were insulting and the plot line took unnecessary turns that were, at their best, grotesque.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone and if, for some twisted reason, you're looking for a copy of it on DVD, you can have mine.
B000084T18|5.0|This album from 50 Cent should be considered a modern day classic.RAP MUSIC AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE!It's been a long time since a rapper like 50's been around......everyone's calling him the next TUPAC, but in reality you can't compare these two.50 isn't as \\"poetical\\" as PAC, but he's just as sharp, and he wants the rap game a hell of a lot more than PAC did. Get Rich Or Die Trying is just what the name says, he went all out on this cd, to show his personal side and to let his vendetta be known as well. From the intro to the last bonus track, 50 puts it down, his lyrics and his style smash every track. this cd is tight, if you don't agree you must not like gangsta rap 50 keeps it real on a street level, there's not hollywood in him, is this possible for a rapper from new york? to be a gangsta rapper and not be hollywood? 50 proved it is.
0060278269|5.0|Abhorsen left Sabriel and Lirael completely in the dust, although I absolutely adore both of those books and you really need to read them to understand Abhorsen, as you get absolutely no introduction to the characters or the world they inhabit (apparently Nix expects the readers to be all normal and read the books in order, which I did anyway).  I loved the fact that we got detailed descriptions of all Nine Precincts of Death, and I thought that the appearance and mechanics of the Ninth Gate were absolutely brilliant.  I had a little tiny problem with the ending because I hate it when they tell you that something is inevitable and then it doesn't happen... although I didn't really want it to happen, it's almost like cheating.  Those of you who have read the book know what I'm talking about (it involves Lirael's hand).  And those of you who haven't... well, I won't spoil the ending.  I definitely recommend this book.  Just remember, NO INTRO.  You absolutely HAVE to read at least Lirael before you read Abhorsen or you will not get the full effect and you will have no idea what's going on.
B000002KBH|5.0|...the other album being, of course, \\"Workingman's Dead\\". Like \\"Workingman's Dead\\", this album works so well because these loveable long-haired dope-smoking acid-dropping coke-snorting pill-popping heroin-injecting whiskey-swilling hippies decided  to supress their shamelessly self-indulgent free-form jam tendencies (see \\"Live Dead\\") and craft a straightforward, unpretentious, no-nonsense album of mellow acoustic rock. Most impressive are the peace-and-love anthem \\"Ripple\\", the narcissistic \\"Friend of the Devil\\" and the breathtaking harmonies that grace \\"Brokedown palace\\". Of course \\"Truckin'\\" is the most radio-friendly tune here, but this entire record plays like a greatest hits collection. A must-own.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book and after hearing some good things about the A&amp;E production, I had to watch it.  I wanted to see the country dances, the grand estates, the interesting characters brought to life.  Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are such interesting characters and the actors who portrayed them in this series did an excellent job.  Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy.  He brings this character to life.  Jennifer Ehle also did a great job in playing Elizabeth Bennet.  Everything was so realistic.  The script writers did a good job of editing some parts so that the main idea and the most important points would be able to retain the same meaning through the two different mediums.<BR>   I hesitated for some time in whether to purchase the VHS or DVD version.  Many reviewers mentioned that the quality of the DVD was horrible.  After watching the DVD for myself, I felt that there was nothing so bad.  The audience is still able to capture the feeling and the theme of the story.  It isn't of absolute perfect quality, but it is still watchable and still highly enjoyable.
B00001ODGR|5.0|WOW  What a concert.  The audio and video on this DVD are top notch. I was blown away with the quality. It was great to see<BR>them perform many of their major hits. I couldn't get over the <BR>vocals, they were awesome. If you like Styx, I HIGHLY recommend<BR>this DVD.
B00005JM1D|4.0|I saw the movie at a special screening and it was really funny. Luke Wilson was really funny and Will Farrel was great too. There were a couple of really funny scenes and you will laugh a lot because the script is pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was that everyone was a loser in love and that made the movie a little less funny. The daughter from 24 and Leah Remini from the King Of Queens are in it too.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Of all of the Disney films created in the past quarter century, Beauty and the Beast would have to be my favorite. The story revolves around the romance between Belle, a beautiful bookworm who was thought of as odd in her provincial French village, and a self-centered Prince-turned-Beast who could only be lifted from his spell by learning to love another and earn her love in return. Along the way, there are dozens of wonderful characters including the Beast's lovable servants-turned household objects and Belle's brutish suitor Gaston who will do anything to make her his wife. The film's score and music and both beautiful and deserving of the Academy Awards they won. The film is truly a classic, so it's surprising that it can be improved for this Special Edition DVD. Three versions of the film including the fascinating Work in Progress edition and 10th anniversary edition with a wonderful new sequence added into the film. Along with the film, the DVD also includes behind the scenes documentaries, galleries of art used in the film, alternate versions of &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; and the Transformation scenes, a couple of wonderful music videos including a new version of the title song by pop group Jump5, and a number of games among other extras. This DVD is truly a must-own for Disney fans and a wonderful addition to any DVD collection.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is a fantastic CD! Beck takes total advantage of his musical ability to heal himself. His pain is prevalent throughout. Some really good, mellow tunes.
B00007KWHO|4.0|I always considered this to be one of Yes's most underrated efforts.  The title track is a great song that is still on the band's playlist at concerts.  The upbeat &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; is my personal favorite.  &quot;The Prophet&quot;, &quot;Then&quot; and &quot;Astral Traveller&quot; are also excellent tracks.  The new Rhino release with extra tracks is noteworthy for the bonus track &quot;Dear Father&quot; (formerly only available on the &quot;Yesterdays&quot; compilation) and the original UK only cover.  This was the last album with Peter Banks, who was of course replaced by the great Steve Howe.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I believe Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" album is one of the best albums by a Pop star. Since last year, Christina Aguilera got an image and musical make over, which is very apparent on her new album\\"Stripped.\\" The album is probably one of the most musically diverse albums that were released in 2002. It's a melting pot of R&B/Soul,rock,hip-hop and Latin influences. It's a far cry from her debut Pop album. The album features R&B/Hip-Hop tracks like \\"Can't hold us down\\" F/Lil' Kim [which has Aguilera striking back at verbal attacks from rapper Eminem and rocker Fred Durst] and \\"Dirrty\\" F/Redman. Some of the more R&B/Soul tracks are the ballads \\"Loving me 4 me,\\" and \\"Impossible\\" F/ Alicia Keys. Her Rock/Pop tracks are \\"Fighter\\"[which she unloads on backstabbers] and \\"Make over[has her screaming like Courtney Love].The album also features beautiful tracks on self esteem like \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"I'm Ok\\" which deals with the pain Aguilera went through growing up with an abusive Father. One of my favorites are \\"Infatuation\\" which has a strong Latin influence to it. I recommend this album to anyone who likes variety in music, and music that deals with pain, love, and hope for the future. Christina Aguilera is very impressive on this album, and I'm sure she will keep on evolving musically. Stripped is one of the best releases of 2002.
B000002JS6|5.0|Who would have guessed it?  Following their most successful album and tour (Highway to Hell), AC/DC lose their front man Bonn Scott.  Then, to everybody's surprise, their first album out the bag with Scott's replacement, Brian Johnson, is their best album ever!<br />AC/DC have never really topped this early '80's masterpiece.  Every song is a classic - so much so that it's like listening to a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album.  Back in Black has the feel, the groove, the power, the hook.  It has it all.<br />This is perhaps the best hard rock album ever recorded.

B000002KB8|5.0|The album was released in early 1970. The one thing that seperates this album than any I've ever heard is that there was nothing that sounded remotely like it before it's time (or after). Sabbath simply invented a new style of music, and in my opinion this is their best album because of it's raw nature and integrity. It's as real as it gets and as far from commercialized music as you could possibly reach.
B00005JLSC|5.0|Reknowned for his complex choreography and innovative staging, director-choreographer Bob Fosse was well known for his ability to impose tremendous style on even the slightest of material--and that is precisely what he did when John Kander and Fred Ebb presented him with their follow up to Broadway smash CABARET.  After considerable script work, the story of two 1920s jailhouse divas emerged on the stage as CHICAGO, a remarkably dark and visually witty commentary on lust, corruption, and fame at any price.  And although Fosse, who has been dead a decade or more, had nothing to do with the screen version with CHICAGO, this big screen show is so completely in his style that it is difficult to believe director Rob Marshall wasn't doing a bit of spiritual channeling when he put it together.<br />This one of those rare screen versions that doesn't pull the teeth of the original material: on screen, CHICAGO is every bit as dark and bitter as it was on stage, and if you're expecting a boy-meets-girl, bursts-into-song musical you're in for a rude awakening.  Singer-dancer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zita-Jones) has become the queen of Chicago's tabolids by offing her faithless husband and perfidious sister; sitting on death row, she's busy enjoying the press and planning to parlay the attention into a big time vaudeville act--but she's suddenly rolled for the throne by show-biz wannabe Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger), who captures press attention when she bumps off her lover and is then caught trying to coax her husband into taking the wrap.  And with fame, fortune, and beating the wrap high priorities, the two slither, snarl, and play games of one-upmanship right into the courtroom under the sponsorship of their equally corrupt lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere.)  It's an arena in which truth counts for nothing and the innocent hang; only hardness, a total lack of integrity, and an implausible lie will get you by.<br />The cast is simply amazing.  Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere come from stage backgrounds, but neither have shown their song-and-dance skills on the big screen until now--and they give every indication of having the time of their lives, tossing off everything from meticulous time steps to classic Fosse-esque squirming choreography, and singing the complicated songs extremely well indeed.  And they are very nearly upstaged by Queen Latifa as the wanton prison matron and John C. Reilly as Roxie's dim husband.  And then there is Rene Zellweger as Roxie Hart.  Frankly, the late great Gwen Verdon, who originated the role on Broadway, is a tough act to follow--but Zellweger sidesteps the trap of merely repeating Verdon's memorable interpretation and creates her own take on the half-niave, half-rapacious jazz baby from hell.  And when all is said and done, she makes Roxie Hart her own.<br />Although some songs from the stage version have been dropped, the best survive, and the company tears strips off them, all the way from the opening \\"All That Jazz\\" to the finishing \\"Nowadays.\\"  And everywhere the Fosse touch is very much in evidence: surrealistic concepts of space and time, slinky and half-naked dancers, wicked wit, and a sexy sneer are the order of the day.  The cinematography is also quite fine, using elements of rapid-fire editing seen in MOULIN ROUGE but without the same \\"beat you to death\\" quality that film had.  The result is dark, glittering, and remarkably sly in its mix of too-accurate social commentary and classic music elements.  And this is one of the few recent musicals that I think will stand the test of time.  Strongly recommended.rd Gere come from stage backgrounds, but neither have shown their song-and-dance skills on the big screen until now--and they give every indication of having the time of their lives, tossing off everything from meticulous time steps to classic Fosse-esque squirming choreography, and singing the complicated songs extremely well indeed.

And when all is said and done, she makes Roxie Hart her own.<br />Although some songs from the stage version have been dropped, the best survive, and the company tears strips off them, all the way from the opening \\"All That Jazz\\" to the finishing \\"Nowadays.\\"  And everywhere the Fosse touch is very much in evidence: surrealistic concepts of space and time, slinky and half-naked dancers, wicked wit, and a sexy sneer are the order of the day.  The cinematography is also quite fine, using elements of rapid-fire editing seen in MOULIN ROUGE but without the same \\"beat you to death\\" quality that film had.  The result is dark, glittering, and remarkably sly in its mix of too-accurate social commentary and classic music elements.  And this is one of the few recent musicals that I think will stand the test of time.  Strongly recommended.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I want to mention Danny Boy. When I heard it I wept. hard to believe anyone could revisit that song and nail it. Some songs feel as thought they were picked for the irony of Johnny Cash sing them and they don't quite work. Personal Jesus espesially. one can see how truly weak a song it is. Even in Johnny's formiable hands it's still just a riff and half an idea for a hook that never finds its voice. &quot;Hurt&quot; is brilliant and &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot; may be the finest Johnny Cash song ever. I wish that he had done &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; on Unchained when his voice was stronger. It's rambling melody doesn't work for Johnny's voice. Message to Rick Rubin! Edit Fiona Apple's insipid &quot;harmony&quot; on &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;! Get this record for &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. I'm made breathless every time I hear it.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Not the best DM album, if you compare it to other gems such as Ultra, Violator, Music for the Masses or Songs of Faith and Devotion. However, Exciter turned out to be Depeche Mode`s turning point, considering that they have been working on electronic sounds since the early 1980`s and has kept going that way to this day. But, this three piece band led by longtime lead vocalist Dave Gahan seems not to be short of brilliance on this 2001, in spite of being slightly below the abovementioned albums, considered by music critics and fans as some of the essential Depeche Mode. Incidentally,  this set of songs is not quite bad either, considering that their music fitted to the 21st Century, so well, especially when electronic/dance acts similar in vein to that of DM, namely The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method, Groove Armada, etc, were going stronger. Exciter is more techno than breakbeat or trip-hop, but, like I said before is not short of brilliance. In fact, it has some very good moments such as \\"Dream On\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"The Dead of Night\\", \\"Lovetheme\\", Freelove\\" or the well-known hit \\"I Feel Loved\\".  Although many fans will find this stuff weak or inconsistent, Exciter deserves to be carefully listened. In short, I won´t recommend it to anyone new to Depeche Mode. But, if you got real guts, grab it and have a few spins on it.
B000000H42|5.0|This one actually took a while to grow on me.  Most reviews focus on King Diamond, who is undeniably brilliant.  But Mercyful Fate was a whole band effort and the instrumentation on this album is fantastic - light years beyond most anything else happening in the mid '80's.  A lot of fans may be attracted to this album due to the MF cover on Metallica's Garage Inc album.  As a cover, that was ok, but nothing touches the original MF material.<br />Those bother by Satanic lyrics should beware the album.  Thematically, this is black metal and actually rather disturbing on first listen.  Musically, this is a complex blend of thrash and traditional heavy metal.  Nothing sounds like Mercyful Fate, though, except some of King Diamond's albums.  Very highly recommended.
B000000993|2.0|This debut from Tool is overrated and is not as interesting as their other albums. The songs and vocals drag on in a repetetive and way and the is little going on to keep me listening.<BR>However, tracks like prison sex, sober and bottom are the best they have written - these display more dynamics and variation. Another strong point is that there are no \\"filler\\" segments like on \\"aenima\\" between tracks to distract you.
B000069AUI|5.0|I haven't been buying too many cd's lately - usually I'll only love a few songs on a cd and the rest will be just so-so.  Not so with this one!  Coldplay is what we need in music right now!  The words and music are heartfelt and melodic.  I can't imagine ever getting bored of listening to it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|If you have never heard Wilco before...buy their first, very rocking album, A.M.  While this is not their most approachable album, it is their best.  Sparse and lush at the same time with haunting sounds surrounding beautiful melodies.  &quot;Ashes of An American Flag&quot; at unbelievable volume on Surround Sound is worth the price alone.
0375414053|5.0|I too am baffled by the number or negative reviews or reviewers who don't understand this book. It hit home 100% with me, as a working mom of 1 and one on the way. I work in an intense, demanding, male dominated field. And unless I want to reschool myself, this is my career and my trade. My family is first, but the balance is NOT easy. And if you are the bread winner, which many of my female friends are these days, many are high up and travel, you have to put forth your best. Why is it that it is OK for men to do that but woman are not putting their family first. Shame on the woman here who wrote that ! Not one woman here asked why her husband didn't quit his job !!! Shame on all of you !! Much of what kate brought up about what is acceptable for a man at the office as a dad vs. a woman and a mom, is right on ! sad but true. She nailed all of the frustrations. The muffia is out there, woman we should learn from this and stop torturing one another. It's not easy being a bread winner and a mother, the standards are NOT equal yet and I think that is one of the main points kate tries to make. I only wish that she had talked more about the transition to a stay at home mom more indepth. I hope this book will help us all to grow as a society. I had my husband read it and I hope you all will too !
B0000009SG|4.0|A lot of people find Zappa's music hard to wrap their brain around at first.  This album has some of the more approachable music.  The humor is weird, as always, but not too obscure.  The themes are largely about sex.<br />I think this album contains some of Zappa's best overall compositions as well.  Zombie Woof, Montana, Dirty Love, Dinah Mo Hum all went on to become great platforms for improvisation and live performance.<br />This is a nice \\"first Zappa album\\" and, of course, a great pick for a Zappa fan as well.
1850897808|3.0|I don't know whose idea it was to pick this reader for the book-on-tape edition, but he was very hard to listen to. He does have an accent but I could have gotten used to that, the main problem is his flat tone of voice. This is an exciting story but he reads it like he is reading his grocery list. My mind kept drifting while I listened to him. I recommend getting the book instead of the cassette.
0195073401|1.0|This book does an excellent job of representing modern economic theory, or to put it more clearly, it represents all that is wrong with modern economic theory. At very best, economic theory now consists largely of commonsense propositions that academics translate into the least comprehensible form. At worst, modern economic theory dwells entirely on pure thought experiments. Such thought experiments are misleading and inaccurate because of their focus on equilibrium conditions (i.e. the solution values to systems of equations). This is not to say that the contents of this book are completely detached from reality. People do react to incentives in much the same way as described in this book. But people do not ever attain so called \\"equilibrium conditions\\".<br /><br />The basic incentive issues in economics are actually quite easy to sort out. Many undergraduate textbooks do just fine explaining incentive issues in economics using verbal logic. Instead of clear and concise verbal logic that most anyone can understand, Mas Colel, Whinston and Green employ sophisticated math models. Why?<br /><br />I have heard many arguments in favor of this approach. `Verbal logic is not logical'. `The verbal approach is too easy'. `You can only understand economics using math'. `Math models are really cool'. `Math is formal'. `You must learn the tools of mathematical analysis so you can read professional journals'.<br /><br />The fact if the matter is that one can depict complex concepts either with words or with math. Math does not necessarily deliver the right answers. Some math models `prove' that markets are efficient, others `prove' that markets fail. This proves only that some math models must be dead wrong. As for formalism, this is an application of the fallacy of style. The validity of any idea never depends upon the manner in which we present it. As for reading journals, the argument that we must learn math modeling because we cannot read journal without it begs the question. Why do we need complex math models in journals?<br /><br />We do not. Logic is logic, verbal or mathematical. Of course, verbal presentations can be flawed too, but anyone who dismisses the verbal approach for this commits the fallacy of false comparisons. There are bad uses of math too. The verbal approach is superior because more people can understand it more easily. The `formal' approach in this book also tends to distract academics from real issues. The notion of competitive equilibrium is a mere thought experiment that has absolutely no relevance to the real world. Yet, many economists focus their attention on constructing ever more sophisticated Walrasian thought experiments. What does this accomplish?<br /><br />Unfortunately, many enter the economics profession simply because they have fun solving systems of mathematical equations. They like solving math models for the same reasons that others like solving cross word puzzles- it's a game! For others, constructing math models is a contest to see who can perform the most spectacular intellectual gymnastics. Rather than being formal and professional, the approach that this book takes to economics represents a juvenile attitude whereby real economic analysis is set aside so that math obsessed \\"economists\\" can engage in a contest to see who can devise the most elegant math model. As Milton Friedman put it recently, economists now use math to impress rather than to inform.<br /><br />This book reveals the sad fact that many economists are doing work that is worthless. This is a sad fact because economics is very important. Things are better with empirical economics- there is some good economic history and econometrics out there. Obsession with math modeling has made current theoretical economics irrelevant, except to those who have fun playing math games. It is also a fact that many formalists fail to understand even the most basic concepts in economics, even in their own fields- I have verified this through numerous conversations with formalists. They are too busy working out formal proofs, like the ones that litter this book, to bother with the concepts that math is supposedly indispensable for understanding.<br /><br />Some would say that this book teaches the tools of technical analysis. What it really teaches how to perform intellectual gymnastics. The authors do work a few substantive concepts into their math. Unfortunately, the substance of this book is almost as poor as its presentation. The authors demonstrate little understanding of the transactions costs/property rights economics developed by Coase, Demsetz, and Alchian and no understanding of Hayek's knowledge problem. This books discussion of public goods and monopoly suffer from a lack of understanding of these concepts. There is little Public Choice in this book. They take a run through the Arrow theorem, but that's about all you will find on Public Choice here. Real institutions and processes get almost no play in this book. The best parts are the parts on game theory. Here the authors stray away from their useless thought experiments and hit on some real issues. There are vastly superior books on game theory, so this bright spot hardly makes up for this books general deficiencies.<br /><br />This book is a disaster because it conditions graduate students to think in terms of static equilibrium only. Of course, the authors might claim that chapter twenty covers dynamics, but this is untrue. Chapter twenty covers the oxymoronic subject of \\"dynamic equilibrium\\". Joseph Schumpeter explained why capitalism cannot be understood in terms of any equilibrium model or \\"golden rule\\" back in 1912. The economists who hail this book as the best book out there, or even slightly useful, have been taken in by some very elaborate and mathematically sophisticated nonsense. If you want to learn real economics read Schumpeter, Knight, Coase, Hayek, North... anybody but MWG.<br /><br />Lucky graduate students will get Nicholson as a graduate textbook. Given the current obsession with formalism, most will be misled by Mas Colel, Whinston and Green. One can only hope that the current trend toward formalism will burn itself out soon, through its own irrelevance. Then there might be a revival of real economics, practiced by true professionals.are too busy working out formal proofs, like the ones that litter this book, to bother with the concepts that math is supposedly indispensable for understanding.

B000002KBU|5.0|This album by Mitchell has to be the finest piece of music written about love, lost love, found love. It is honestly heartfelt and true to Joni. If you don't own this one, you don't love music!!!! No other work out there will take you on the emotional trip that this one does. I can't rave enough about this. I have a copy of this CD in my house as well as in the car, I will not be left without it, you never know when you'll feel the need for it.  <br />PS  For all you Tori Amos fans, listen to this and you will see where Tori copped her style.

B00005JL78|3.0|Minority Report got a whole bunch of positive press, and it's the sort of movie that, in production values alone, basically couldn't fail to get at least a \\"thumb up\\" from the average reviewer. But as the sort of cerebral science fiction it intends to be, it's a mess, mostly because it violates its own setup so much that by the end it seems like little more than a chase movie set in a high-budget future world.<br /><br />To give you one example: the \\"pre-cogs\\" in the movie can, as a team, see the future -- but the movie goes to lengths to establish some limits to that precognition. They can only \\"see\\" events that are exceptionally wrenching or emotional -- the murders they're meant to prevent being one example. Okay, so why, once Anderton is on the run, can the pre-cog he has with him predict every little subtle movement of all the people in a mall, right down to the line of sight of the cops chasing them? Hmm? And let's get to that central murder set-up: how could the real killer possibly rely on someone with psychic abilities not to be able to see through -- ta dum -- a mask and a trenchcoat? What, does he know where the \\"camera\\" will be?<br /><br />That sort of problem vitiates this movie's every plot twist, and there are lots of them. It makes the whole thing fall flat. Another simple example that I'll bet occurred to every single viewer: Anderton is running to avoid a murder charge, but in the process he risks killing, oh, fifty-odd people at least. Did anyone fail to see that irony? Anyone at all?<br /><br />So, what's the end result? A chase movie with lots of flashy action. We get a \\"fight in a factory\\" sequence in which the good guy leaps in and out of the machinery. Does this sound like any Warner Brothers cartoons? I thought of that theme music, even, during the movie. Naturally, during the factory chase our hero winds up in a fist fight with the administrator who's chasing him. A fist fight. With a lawyer. The lawyer came to the factory with a sort of SWAT team of cops, but he ends up punching Anderton. Yep.<br /><br />Did I mention that the veteran character actor who always plays a shady, malevolent character plays a shady, malevolent character?<br /><br />So, why would you watch this? For the same reason lots of people really, really love Blade Runner. (There's even an elaborate scene involving eye surgery that can't be anything but an homage to that movie.) The world Spielberg created in this movie is lavishly done. It sometimes doesn't make a lot of sense -- the chaos of individually-tailored sound \\"ads\\" playing for every customer at the Gap seem to make the store almost unbearable to shop in, and the Pre-Crime computer interface is nice but appears to be unusable (or at least ridiculously hard to document, which would be critical given its uses). Oh, and just why are all future settings depressingly bleak and gritty? Just wondering... But the movie's worth watching, if you happen to have a chance, because the world is interesting to poke around in.<br /><br />But does it pass Gene Siskel's criterion? Is the movie more interesting than, say, a dinner conversation between all the futurists who made that imaginary world up? Probably not.AT team of cops, but he ends up punching Anderton.

B00005ATZT|4.0|The Fugitive is a fantastic thriller, one of the best ever, not succeeding only as a thriller, but also as an action movie and a drama. Harrison Ford stars as Doctor Richard Kimble, a surgeon from Chicago who was falsely accused and convicted of the crime of killing his wife, while avoiding Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones and his team who are sent to hunt down the doctor and bring him back to prison. Throughout the movie, Kimble evades the police while trying to track down his wife's real murderer. The script is not outstanding, but the story is elevated by endless suspense, great action scenes, and some intense acting between the two leads. The ending climax is also a fantastic piece of work, filled with suspense and very satisfying. The cinematopgraphy is as naturalistic as possible, creating a sense of realism. The Fugitive is one of the finest in its genre. It holds up brilliantly on repeated viewings and is one of the best action films of the 1990's. Don't miss this film it is a must see.
0425107469|5.0|Although this was the second of Koontz's books that I read it definitely assured that I would be a lifetime fan.  I have read most of his books since (the only reason I haven't read them all is because I was on an Anne Rice kick for a while) and I have to say that they all have something special, but this one was especially wonderful.  The characters were believeable and were complex enough to seem real but Koontz did such a good job describing their personal struggles and feelings that you felt you understood them in the end.  I also loved the classic battle of good vs. evil that the dog and the other creature represented.  I'll admit the idea of a genius dog that can read and answer questions is a little far fetched but the story and the characters in this book are so believeable that you don't really notice.  (At least I didn't)  All in all this is an excellent read and definitely a good place to start for anyone who is just discovering Koontz's extraordinary talent.

I first saw Rudy when my children were just infants, now at 10 and 12 years of age, this movie offers them motivation to succeed at whatever they do.  It is an example of determination against the odds.  We visited Notre Dame the summer of 2001. My daughter, then 8 said: \\"I want to say a prayer at the Grotto like Rudy!\\"  Now she is using the story for a school project.  Parents, watch this movie with your children.
B00005OLY5|5.0|Wells. There seems to be claiming of this ripping of the idea of Lord of The Rings. Now, I am sure Lord of the Rings is not the first and original creator of this type of storyline: An evil ruler of a kingdom has sensed a threat that might overthrow/destroy/defeat/banish them in the future. This threat comes in the form of something or someone seemingly harmless and small at first, I will call Joe. But Joe somehow evades detection. Somehow a short time later on, or many many years later, joe comes back either by himself or with friends. And somehow the group or joe alone manages to defeat/overthrow/banish/destroy the evil ruler. I mean come on...I am sure Lord of the Rings wasn't the first and only story to do something similar. Krull, The Dark Crystal, CONAN,  Robin Hood, and even King Arthur for Gods Sake. History is littered with those type of stories. <br />Anyhow, Willow was a GREAT film. Fun and enjoyable. Incredibly good special effects considering the time it was made. Wonderful characters, nice story (see above), great soundtrack, all-in-all, a great movie. All time classic.

The gasping Mount Rushmore finale  is unforgettable.  This DVD version is not the squeezy widescreen, but is almost a full-screen.  There is a good documentary called &quot;Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North By Northwest&quot; hosted by Eva Marie Saint.  Also on this DVD is the Hitchcock trailers and the tv spot.  Alfred Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance is at the start of this film, so you can sit back and totally relax and enjoy the picture.

Not only does it have a coll metal case, but it is also has 6 hours of special features on two discs. The disc's also have some of the coolest menus i have seen on a dvd in along time!!!!!!! The dvd has two different virsions of the movie. the regular theatrical version of the film, and the special edition deleted scenes incorparated into the movie. There are also some hidden features in the discs which are fun to find. All in all this is the dvd that all dvd collectors must have. fans of the terminator must own, and a dvd that everyone should buy. It is definetly well worth the money.
B000003TAB|5.0|It's a shame nobody has really heard Bleach or Incesticide. Both are better than Nevermind and In Utero in my opinion. This shows the true side of what punk and Nirvana really is. Dive starts off the CD great with the bass starting the song off. Then you work your way to the cover Turnaround that Devo originally did. A great song! Then 2 covers that were done by The Vaselines. Molly's Lips is a great song that Nirvana did better than The Vaselines in my opinion. Son of a Gun lyric wise odd but neat, and once again Kurt and Nirvana shined through again. With songs like (New Wave) Polly, Aero Zeppelin, and Aneurysm this brings out the true Nirvana. (New Wave) Polly is even better than the one on Nevermind. A hell of a lot faster and cooler. Aero Zeppelin has lots of tempo changes which is pure genius by Kurt. Has it's SLAYER moments! Aneurysm is the best song on the entire CD in my opinion. The lyrics are just funny, but awesome, and the way it goes from heavy distortion to clean then back to distortion. Aneurysm is also a great cover to do if your in a band! Really great stuff. This is truely a great album. If you like this one go out and buy Bleach as well!

B00005ATQF|5.0|Stanley Kubrick had an uncompromising talent in telling stories.  Full Metal Jacket, a harrowing study of the dehumanization of Vietnam, is no exception.<br />The film is divided into three sections.  The first section is all about Basic Training and the importance of a Drill Sergeant (Lee Ermey).  It is here where you first meet the central character of the story: Private Joker (Matthew Modine).  However, this section of the film is dominated by the presence of Leonard Lawrence a.k.a. Private Pyle (brilliantly played by Vincent D'Onofrio).  He is nothing short of an idiot and he is the  central subject of the Drill Sergeant's rage.  After a while, he begins to go mad, which leads to the first section's unforgettable finale.<br />The second part of the film basically deals with what Vietnam looked like in the midst of war.  Joker is now a reporter for Stars and Stripes and he has been enlisted to cover the war along with the Lusthog squad, lead by his good friend from training, Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard).  We are also introduced to the bloodthirsty Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Joker's \\"rival\\".  The third part of the film is when Joker's world begins to fall apart when the platoon is attacked by a mysterious sniper.<br />With the exception of Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket is the most disturbing war film ever made, mixed with the horrors of war but also the beauty of it.  Unlike most war films today, despite a few graphic scenes, the violence is sparing and only used when absolutely necessary.  Kubrick directs the film as if it's a God's eye view of combat, which adds more pain and sorrow to the characters.  But even if you don't like Kubrick, the film is worth it alone for Mr. D'Onofrio's blistering portrayal of Pvt. Pyle.<br />From the shaving of the heads montage at the beginning to the second you hear The Rolling Stones' melancholy opus Paint It Black at the ending credits, you know that this film is nothing short of extraordinary.
0321127420|4.0|I agree wholeheartedly with an above post which pointed out that the subject material is mostly known to the average enterprise developer. I am at best an average developer and found I'd already thought of much of this stuff myself.<br />One thing I would like to add is that this book was still excellent reading and skimming through the patterns sparked my creative energies. I find that when I read through it, even if I 'know' the patterns already, it helps me explore their organization and consequences.<br />I was disappointed that I wasn't blown away with helpful new concepts, but quite happy with my purchase all the same. Buy this if you want a thorough guide to EAA and maybe some enjoyable afternoon reading.<br />(The following was added about 2 months after the original review) After owning this book for awhile, I've found it more and more indispensible. My original review, above, mentions that few of the concepts seem new, however, now that I've read it more thoroughly and applied some of the concepts, I don't think that 'mind-blowing originality' is what I should have been looking for.<br />Fowler's 'Refactoring' is another example of a great book without any stunningly original concepts. Like Refactoring, PEAA can serve as a great guide to page through when you're stuck on a project and need to review your options.
6305841861|4.0|The second movie in the `Evil Dead' series is a somewhat more polished, sophisticated follow-up to the original `Evil Dead' with a sense of humor thrown in for good measure. (I must add a caveat to that last statement; if the humor potential of seeing the main character amputate one of his own hands with a chainsaw, then watching it crawl across the room on its own to give him the finger evades you perhaps you should skip this title. You don't watch a movie like this to follow the permutations and subtle unfolding of the plot.)<br />Similar to `Halloween II', this film starts on the same night the previous one ended. The opening moments are a bit of revisionist history with only the main character, Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend at the haunted cabin instead of the group of five in the first film. Not to worry; the girlfriend is quickly dispatched, clearing the way for a whole new quartet of cannon fodder. <br />What happens after that is fairly predictable. The dead are evil, and manifest their evilness by trying to make the living into more of the dead. They are, in a sense, only doing what comes naturally. That this involves dismemberment, as well as the oozing and spewing of substances of varying levels of viscosity is merely incidental.<br />What makes this appealing is the sheer gusto of the filmmaking. Mr. Campbell and director Sam Raimi are old high school buddies, and the enthusiasm of people getting to do something they've wanted to do and talked about doing for years comes through. They are shots and sequences in the movie that only happen when the people making the movie are going at it with ambition and energy.<br />If you enjoy this genre, this is a title you want on your shelf. The commentary tracks are excellent bonus features, especially if Mr. Campbell cracks you up.
0446677450|5.0|The one word that best descibes this book is POWERFUL.This is indeed a powerful book, chock full of POWERFUL ideas that will get you POWERFUL results.NETWORK MARKETING is the wave of the future. It is today what franchising was in the late 50's.To the 1 star reviewer that said his entire upline had to go  back to a job, I fail to see any point in that.I mean, what would you expect from a upline that has people like you in their downline; people that can't break away from their pc's long enough to build a business. I'm surprised that they are not on food stamps!Network marketing isn't for everybody. It takes skill and a personality plus the ability to grow. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a excellent book and in these days of massive downsizing, this book is so timely and necessary.I also recommend The Millionaire Mind and The Millionaire Next Door along with Cash Flow Quadrant.
1878424319|2.0|All this kind of books are equal, the writer writes what happened to him and think that if everybody do what he is doing will be a better world. The book is definitely boring and it has nothing of the Toltec story, if you skip the introduction and you go directly to the four agreements and only read that, will be fine. Don't waste your time with the epilogue either.
B00007JVBI|5.0|It sounds a little more polished than her previous albums, so maybe a little bit less of the 'indie sound.' Its like what NOFX said about their getting 'too good' to make really punk music anymore. Cat power is similar in that she's lost the roughness that I liked i her earlier stuff, but what she's gained is an even more refined lyrical talent and she uses her beautiful voice even more to her advantage.<br />Not much to be said about Eddie Vedder's contribution (because you can hardly hear him) but Dave Grohl did a great job on the drums.
B000002UA5|5.0|While this album maybe to far out there for some people it is stll art in only the way Pink Fkoyd and maybe a few other bands could have pulled off.<br />I say a start to a new ending because in many ways it was a start to a whole new way that Pink Floyd approached their music from an insturmental and lyrical way clear up to the Wall.  Which for many of us was the end.<br />Also you had to be of the time to really enjoy.
B000021YQV|3.0|Upon first listen, I was absolutely exhilarated by this cd. The lead singer's voice is easily the most exciting that I have heard this year. The instrumentals had a surprising originality to them, resembling a roller-coaster ride that the rider is blind-folded to (you think you know where the track is going, only to be jolted some place else).<br />But a third listen was less rousing. The fact that I wasn't exhilarated the same way again is proof that this isn't classic material. Worst of all, there developed a repetitiousness in each production of the song.<br />Overall, all of the songs are good. However, some are still great. Unfortunately, since I borrowed the cd from a pal, I don't recall the exact track and name of them. Although, some of my favorites were released as singles.<br />With such a great lead singer, this band would totally benefit from a more adventurous sound that deviated from the norm. Break free of repetition.

The movie sounds better than ever and the disc is made for one purpose: great audio. Pioneer?s equivelent to a SUPERBIT DVD. I don?t think I?ll ever use the SE?s mix again! Oh yeah, it also has the same old English dub. Japanese: A+, English: B+.<br />VIDEO: Not much of a diffrence between the 2-disc version. Grade: B+<br />No features but you don?t need them at all.
B00005221M|5.0|WOW! What an adventure! Epic drama based on the classic novel by James Fenimore Cooper. Beautiful cinematography, realistic battle scenes, and love story between Daniel Day- Lewis and Madeline Stowe make this a must-see!  Graphic violence is a little hard to take, but makes the movie more realistic.  Will keep you enthralled from beginning to teary-eyed end. Buy this movie now, with it's recently reduced price!  I payed quite a bit more for it, but it is a definite favorite.
0805066691|4.0|I read this book way back in 1977 when I was a student. I'm half English and knew little of American History. It was a very profound read then and I felt an enormous amount of sympathy in reading it for a culture that was doomed by the arrival of Europeans. I have looked at some of the reviews and those that criticise it seem to dislike the one-sided approach that portray's Indians as Good and White man as Bad. To them I would point out that for a long time we have had the image of Indians as Bad thrust at us by movies and TV shows. I don't think I'm wrong in believing that there was already a stereotype that potrayed Indians as murderous savages, and that is from looking at it in England. So, I thinks it's ok to have something that discriminates so postively in favour of a race that was vilified at so many levels. However, nobody should rely on just one source as the whole story.<br />If you really care, you will read more than one book and find out as much as possible. I'm sure doing so will show that as with everything it is never a simplisitc black and white picture, there is always good and bad on sides and there is always something right and wrong in both too.  <br />Whatever your views, I think it would be hard to deny that their culture and race was overwhelmed and almost completely destroyed by the immigration of Europeans. We will never know if the cultures could have co-existed peacefully and the fact they didn't probably proves they couldn't.<br />That doesn't make either side right or wrong. It does show that we find it easier to go to war with foreign cultures than embrace them and that has been a fact throughout history. It seems that in human relations one side has to be defeated and broken rather than respected and equal. <br />The book made me sad way back then when I was young and very idealistic. Today I have had a lot of reality woven into my views but I still believe in ideals and I haven't forgotten how I felt when I read the book. However itseems that nations, cultures, races and religions still don't know how to live in peace.<br />My mother is Armenian and my granparent were refugees from Turkey in 1914, I learnt of their history first hand. My family lived in Cyprus when the island experienced war and division. What I have seen and learnt is that we all lose through war and hatred. What I don't understand is how we can read and learn about the past and then repeat it so often again.
B0000214F0|1.0|Incest, bestiality, homosexuality, lesbianism, fisting, all wrapped up in an absolute mess of a movie!  I'm no prude when it comes to sex and violence, but this is way over the top.  Bought it simply out of curiosity...what a disappoinment..If you have any interest at all in the history of ancient Rome, buy the series \\"I, Claudius\\". DO NOT be taken in with all of the hype being made here over this movie!  DVD picture is grainy and dark at best.
630326669X|3.0|I think Godard might be making fun of the Stones but it doesn't matter because the Stones footage is so good. Unfortunately Godard doesn't just stay in the studio with the Stones but divides his time between studio takes of the song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and an ongoing bit of junkyard theatre involving revolutionaries and white girls and readings from various texts, its weird yea but it gets boring quick. Whenever you're in the junkyard you can't wait to get back in the studio and hear and see some more Stones footage. This is the Stones you want to see too--doing what they do best, being creative, and working out and putting together the various elements of their greatest composition. Since the Stones sections are so good you just start finding the cuts back to the junkyard more and more annoying. The Stones star quality just overrides whatever intention Godard may have had. Godard was cool, he made boredom his aesthetic but the stones cool is just way more captivating. 5 stars for the Stones. 1 for the other stuff.
B00004X0Q0|3.0|I'd heard that this band was totally killer, so I got Relationship of Command.  A lot of the songs lived up to what I heard, but some it wasn't really for me.  The singer gets too excited and into it for my taste.  That sets off my emo alarm.  There is very little emo that I enjoy, so the fact that I like this record as much as I do says something.  If you really like punk and emo, you should defitnitely pick this up.  I like the new band, The Mars Volta, with the two dudes from this band that have afros.  They took some of the grand, spacey sounds from At the Drive-In (the parts I like) and ran with it.  <br />I would venture to say that, no matter your taste, you should check out Relationship of Command by this band or Tremulant ep by The Mars Volta.  One (or both) of the records is guaranteed to connect with you.  These guys are talented.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|These two girls are amazing. This cd provides a wonderful musical experience. The Russian versions of &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; are beautiful. I listened to this cd nonstop just to get the whole experience of these two beautiful voices. Lena and Julia will go very far in their career. Their music is great to dance to and great to just listen to. This is one cd I know I can't stop listening to. I have been a huge t.A.T.u fan ever since I heard &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; on the radio. They had me hooked from the beginning of the song. There are many great songs on this album such as their version of &quot;How Soon is Now&quot;. I believe this is better than the original recording. These girls are very talented and will go very far.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Not since 1996, when Hugh Grant donned a doctor's jacket and turned serious in \\"Extreme Measures,\\" has there ever been a picture that would allow me to accept this mannered British actor -- as being not much more than an OK leading man with floppy hair -- who would forever play the same character in one flimsy crowd-pleasing comedy after another.<br />Until now.  \\"About A Boy\\" goes so much further to enhance Hugh Grant's career than even that \\"villain\\" he played in \\"Bridget Jones Diary.\\"  Hands down, this is Grant's best career performance.  Though his high English accent is still present, he dumps his standard tics and stuttering, adding greater meaning to the phrase, \\"irresponsible and intellectual louse.\\"<br />Some elements in this picture seem to follow a formula, e.g., idiot fop remains an idiot, kid enters picture, so do a couple of women, idiot fop wakes up.  But there's more going on in this observational comedy-drama.  It feels authentic.<br />Set entirely in Great Britain, Grant plays a guy who does absolutely nothing.  He lives off royalties from some horrific Christmas ditty everybody loves that was written by his father, who's dead.  No commitments, no shackles; he's a man who loves to juggle girls and lies.  He's not a stupid man, as is apparent by how he strings sentences in his narration.  He just doesn't give a damn.<br />Without giving away how his transformation occurs, there is some true-to-the-heart revelations that are believable to anyone who has gone through 'em -- which means most of us -- albeit at a much earlier age than the character played by Hugh Grant (in this film, he's pushing 40).  That it comes to this guy so late makes his reactions all the more precious and rewarding.<br />What I like most about this film is its rich characters in a dramatic script that draws fine humor from bad situations.  This humor, for the most part, doesn't stretch to push a joke that's out of place.  This keeps the tonality of the picture consistent and engrossing.  (Think of that restaurant scene in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and you know what I'm talking about when I say I have no tolerance for something that gets a big laugh but is stupidly \\"out of place\\" with a tone established 30 minutes before.)<br />You think you've seen your share of \\"bachelor\\" stories?  Well here's one that allows you to smirk and laugh without feeling patronized or contempt by a endless string of cheap sit-com lines.<br />Hugh Grant's \\"Will\\" displays the type of \\"intellectual\\" befuddlement that is believable by virtue of his knowledge of arts and history, but with complete ignorance about a life outside night clubs and his 21st century-equipped bachelor \\"flat.\\"  He only cares, when we meet him, about pleasure, as expressed in elapsed periods of time he calls \\"units.\\"  Beyond self-centered, he's still charming, given how brutally honest he can be about how awful he's perceived by the world.  When he handles a baby, it's just a \\"thing\\" to him.  An animal, a pet, would be more endearing to him.  But he's only selectively honest.  His pursuit of pleasure, his demand to live for \\"the moment,\\" requires \\"lies\\" to achieve success as he sees it.<br />Then in walks this smart kid named \\"Marcus,\\" wonderfully played by Nicholas Hoult.  He carries the other half of the picture.  So expressive, wiser beyond his years, yet so used to be picked on, so eager to please his suicidal but loving hippie mother, played by the always fabulous Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense, The Hours).<br />Of course there's a love interest, and it's not Toni Collette.  It turns out to be someone else.  While there are some goofy moments that could've been clipped here and there, on the whole, there are few false notes here.  All of the character actors play off each other well, and they raise Grant's performance to higher levels.  Finally, a Hugh Grant picture that makes best use of Hugh Grant; and the script is everything, based in part on the hit novel by Nick Hornby.<br />I'm certain if this film had been released in the winter of 2002, Grant would be up for an Oscar and his film would be among the nominees for Best Picture.  It has a snappy visual style and tempo, as well as a soundtrack that is perfect.<br />Some report mixed emotions with the end of the picture.  I think this has to do with wanting air-tight closure.  It's not quite there but I was still satisfied; in the end, because you've invested so much in these characters, because you haven't been bored for a second, because you haven't seen an endless barrage of cliches -- you don't want this story to end.  You want to keep going to see what happens, despite getting hint of a mild uplift in the last frame.  This is the best feeling to have.  Keep you wanting more.<br />Finally, I love how \\"About a Boy\\" isn't just about the boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  It's also about Will (Hugh Grant).  Will \\"Will\\" ever grow up?  Maybe, maybe not.  Watch this to find out.Nick Hornby.  <br />I'm certain if this film had been released in the winter of 2002, Grant would be up for an Oscar and his film would be among the nominees for Best Picture.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|Ever since I first heard these two I wanted their cd. Lena and Julia have very powerful, clear voices. From &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; to the extended &quot;Show Me Love&quot; this cd provides a wonderful musical experience. They are going to go far in the music business. Rock on girls!
B00005YUPO|2.0|I bought this tape after my infant daughters fell under the delightful spell of Baby Mozart.  While this tape is also primarily soothing classical music and video footage of toys and puppets, it doesn't seem to work the magic that Baby Mozart does.  My girls lose interest in the tape about halfway through.  I have had much better luck with Baby Van Gogh and Baby Newton.
0151006903|2.0|The Amazon.com reviewer flatters this book by calling it a \\"giddy and exasperating romp\\".  Giddy?  No.  Exasperating?  Yes, and regretfully so, for I am a longtime fan of Eco's books (both academic and literary).  \\"Baudolino\\" finds Eco plumbing his considerable knowledge of medieval exotic travel literature and imaginative geographies, and it reads less like a novel than like the effort of a schoolboy trying to impress his teacher with the long bibliography at the end of his essay, rather than the essay itself.  The story suffers as a result.  The characters are flat, lifeless, often one-note caricatures (Niketas, the man to whom Baudolino narrates his life's story, is made particularly grating by Eco's insistent mention of his love for fine food and drink).  Presumably we are meant to be fascinated by Baudolino's (and, by extension, this novel's) negotiation of truth and falsity, storytelling and lying, but this negotiation, for all of its attempt to masquerade as Deep and Philosophical, comes off mostly as Dull and Ploddingly Obvious.  Eco's working with magical story material here -- the Old Man of the Mountain and his assassins, Prester John's gemmed wonder of a kingdom, the court of cosmopolitan and militarily-minded Frederick II -- so it's a special pity that his own narrative is considerably far less magical.  This book -- chock full of discussions of wonder -- could use a good injection of wonder itself.

0446672653|5.0|Reassuring<br />For people who feel there must be more to life than just living in the present, Brian Weiss illustrates through his case studies and the messages from above that this is indeed the case.  In today's world a lot of people feel lonely and find it hard to find a love that is completely fulfilling in all aspects - body, mind and soul.  This book shows us that love is there always, and that we will be guided to it when the time is right for us.  Our life - or rather lives - on earth are for a specific learning purpose, and once we accept this, and that there are our families of soulmates either here on earth or above to help us always, we can be reassured that we are not alone ever.  This book is not just about finding perfect love, but how opening our hearts will draw the right thing to us, be it love or other things in our lives.
B00000I07Q|5.0|I give Bon Jovi real good credit they lasted, not many people stay around more than 5 years.  New Jersey is a great album, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; is my favorite.  It topped the charts for 6 weeks and sold 7 million. If I were to suggest a band that would last another 20 years I would say Bon Jovi.
B00006IU73|4.0|This record has been growing on me so I am redoing my review. The style is very melodic prog rock with nicely placed electronic effects. The record has a lot of singing. The vocals are lyrically mature and well performed. This band's percussive edge is not as hard as Dream Theater or Rush, but nicely done. The harder edge makes it work for me. <br /> Apparently, this band was formed in a similar way to, \\"The Dukes of Stratepheer (sp?)\\" (AKA-XTC). If you don't know that story, it is a band starting out as a toungue and cheek band, mocking some of the art rock styles of the 60's & 70's. In retrospect, it makes me realize just how talented these guys are. Tight sound with precise playing that works good from the get go. <br /> I have got to say that this record is very well thought out with a slight lean towards the \\"commercial\\", but it plays well to us prog rock heads too (smile!). The first couple of songs will grab you right away. It takes some time to fully appreciate the complete record, but you more than likely will. At first I heard some chord progressions that, at the time I thought they were, all too familiar. WRONG! Hind site gets us closer to 20/20 and what this band is doing are creating a more accessable prog rock record that will stay with you listen after listen.<BR> Great spin!

Yes, of course, it's 'neat', this idea that the great America was discovered by someone from China...but let's be real. I want foreigners to respect and take my country and culture seriously. Making up a fairy tale such as this one is not the way to achieve this. <BR>Having read the book, I will admit that the author spins a good yarn; he's very convincing. But it's a fantasy. <BR>I wish that I had thought of writing this book, then I could be rich!
B00005JLXC|4.0|The greatest superhero movie ever.  This movie can manage to make super hero still appear as though he is a good person in one of the darkest settings for a movie of its kind.  I personaly loved it.  Into such a short movie they can have millions of intense camera angles and some really intense fight scenes.  If you like action movies with at least some depth, this is your movie. See it while you still can it blows Spider-man out of the water, even you dont like Affleck still see it otherwise you will miss out.(I am always open for your opinion, so write back!)
B00005UK1F|1.0|Don't believe all the hype. I'm a big fan of prog metal, and this just isn't as good as everyone says.... This 60 minute song annoyingly on only one track is simply not very exciting. It does a lot, like have random slow opera singer parts in the middle, and a variety of vocal sounds. But it was bottom line not very interesting. It stays rather stagnant, doesn't seem to go anywhere. I listened a few times, and decided I had thoroughly wasted my money. I'm not saying that everyone here is wrong, their tastes are obviously different from mine, and that is the beautiful thing about music is that everyone sees it different. All I'm saying is don't buy the CD blindly. Know what you're getting into...<br />EDIT: I'm adding to this review because I first wrote the above after only listening to it a couple of times. Some people told me to listen more, give it time to set in. So I did. I hate it much more now. It is simply boring. It is an hour long, and honestly lacks anything that keeps it interesting for the entire time. Why everyone is so enthralled with it, I'll never know. I rescind what I said before. Ignore not knowing what you're getting into...DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!!
B00005JLRR|3.0|right off the bat, let me say, this is an enjoyable film. Despite the miserable reviews it has been getting, it is my second favorite TNG movie, next to First Contact. This was intended to be the last one with TNG's crew, (As was that lame fifth one.) but because of its bad reception, I hope that they will do what they did in 91. Because of the failure of \\"The Final Frontier\\" Paramount brought back the director of the most successful classic Trek movie (Nicolas Meyer) to help make one last movie to make up for it. I heard that they are already planning for an 11th movie, about which, I know little. I hope that this isn't TNG's swan song, it would ... to see such a brilliant cast of characters go out on this note. I want to see Jonathan Frakes return to direct on more TNG movie. That time around, while seeing the awesome special effects that Nemesis boasts will help, it must also incorporate a better script and more original plot. Yes, Nemesis DID borrow too much from Wrath of Khan. That done, it would be interesting to see what direction the franchise goes. Seeing as to how Deep Space 9 Voyager and Enterprise were never popular enough to spawn any movies, they should explore new realms. Maybe make some movies all about the Klingons- and get themselves an R rating! I am just throwing out some ideas here, because after this poorly recieved movie, the franchise has no where to go but up.
0316666343|2.0|The idea of this book, a dead girl in heaven seeing her family and murderer, was such a good idea!  I was enjoying the book in the first couple of chapters and looking forward to reading the book.  But the more I read, the more I was disappointed.  I continued reading the book hoping it would pick up my interest again; but it never did and I felt the ending was just so dull and the one instance in the book of Suzie entering Ruth's body just didn't fit with the rest of the book.  I felt it was a waste of my time and money.  Come on Alice, it was a good idea, you could have done better!
0553212478|2.0|I've seen other people who have rated this book well, but cannot understand where they see the ingenious in this book.  Personally when I started reading this I hoped for a scary book that infered on human behavior.  What I got was a drawn of boring story set in 4 parts.<br />  The beginning is somewhat interesting and delves on Frankenstein the scientist learning about life and developing the monster.  This part has a somewhat boring start, but once he starts making it it goes faster.  Then once hes done with this the monster is made..... and it slows down to a miserable pace.<br />  From here it will have short spurts of something exciting, like for seven pages, then it goes into a fifty page boring streak, prattling on about details you don't care about.  If it wants to emphasize that Frankenstein is lonely, it takes 25 pages of examples when five would be sufficient.  From about the time Frankensteins monster is born you want it to die and let the story be over with because it is so boring.  Not to mention predictable.  I could predict the deaths of some of the people fifty pages away!  Let me just say leave this book on the shelf and don't start to read it.  You'll hate the book, and yet you'll probably make yourself finish it just because you started it.  At least thats the way it was with me.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Ok, normally i don't bother with writing on the same album twice, but this album is the best album i've ever bought. I've owned several hundreds of albums from Led Zeppelin to Pearl Jam. Not one album i've ever owned has matched the songwriting and music contained in this masterpiece. I'd like to note that several people have written reviews calling Creed a Pearl Jam rip-off. BWAHAHA! I've listened to the best Pearl Jam has to offer, and frankly, it's insulting to compare washed out trash like that to this, the prize of rock music over the last 12 years. Ok, maybe that was a bold statement...so, here is why i believe that. Vocals-Listen to Eddie Vedder, yeah he had a decent voice, but it lacked the passion, or for that matter,  the quality of Scott Stapps voice. Vedder had a more rough, grungy voice. Stapp's voice can reach much higher notes and has a clear, crisp quality that Vedder's lacked. A final note is the passion of which Stapp sings. You don't believe me? Listen to Wash Away Those Years. The bridge of that song has some of the most amazing rock vocals ever. K, Faceless Man's ending, amazing. The fact is Creed and Pearl Jam are completely different styles, it just takes some listening to each to realize that. Some of you are wondering, what's my point? My point is every single song on this album is incredible. Great songwriting, vocals, guitaring, bass work, and percussion. What do 12 incredible songs equal? One amazing album. Listen to this album. Listen to this masterpiece. It's worth the time and money.
B00000DC10|5.0|Three and a half years ago, this CD completely changed the way I listen to music.  I never liked punk much before this, and I was disappointed to learn that most punk bands were the same conventional, recycled garbage I'd always taken punk to be.  Refused, on this album, was an amazing algamation of hardcore, jazz, and beat poetry.  I still can't go more than a month or so without listening to this.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I was very dissappointed in this movie.  I mean, it was well done, but totally butchers the incredible book.  It is very different and leaves the ending wide open, where in the book we are shocked as to the way it ends, which is very different than this movie mind you.  I just think that if you want to really keep up on the Lecter Trillogy, then you should read the book to help you.  This movie will mess everything up.  Just rent it, dont buy it.
0140067477|4.0|I've read this book a couple of times and I always enjoy it.  I think it provides a good introduction to Taoist philosophy (I haven't read much other Taoist philosophy so take that for what it's worth).  I like how bits of Winnie-the-Pooh are used to provide examples and illustrate abstract concepts.  I agree with many of the basic ideas of the book.  But reading it always leaves me vaguely unsatisfied.  While much of what the author says makes sense, it isn't easy to apply it to daily life.  I would describe two of the main axioms of the book as &quot;go with the flow&quot; and &quot;be true to yourself.&quot;  These are both sound pieces of advice but what do they really mean?  What am I supposed to do with that?  When I read the book I find myself nodding and agreeing but as soon as I put it down the words kind of evaporate.  There just isn't enough substance to apply it to my life.  Or maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.  Nobody said it was easy.
B000089A07|5.0|I went to see this movie the day it came out in the theater and loved it as much as I loved the book (which I gave 5 stars also).  This is the Prequel to the movie \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", and lives up to it all the way.  But the only think I think they couldnt do was make Anthony Hopkins look as young as he did in \\"TSOTL\\".  But its ok, he still does a great job.  As always, they change the movie a little bit to make viewers happy, but nothing major that effected my view of the film.  Edward Norton was not exactly my idea of Will Graham, but he played the part great, adn now i can only picture him as Graham.  One thing I found very cool about this flick was that they even made an exact recreation of Lecters cell from \\"TSOTL\\", and use some of the same actors from the movie also.  All of this adds up to make a great movie that you should not miss.  <br />All and all, this book and movie was excellent and a must watch for any fan of mystery thrillers.
0156907399|4.0|Virginia Woolf's &quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; (pub. 1927) has some similarities to her previous work, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; (pub. 1925).  The latter covers just one day in the life of Mrs. Dalloway; in the former, the first 127 pages of 209 pages cover just one day in the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay. A dinner party at the end of the day has an important place in both of the novels as well as in the lives of Mrs. Dalloway and Mrs. Ramsay.  Aside from those similarities, the overwhelming one is the stream of consciousness writing style that Woolf adopted in &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and carried over into &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  I can't remember the applicable quote but the sense of it is &quot;There are certainly a lot of words there.&quot;  Words fall on words as grains of sand in an hourglass fall on to the pile of sand at the bottom of the glass - words, words, words, etc.  Impressions that might well have been only momentary feelings of a character are turned into paragraphs and even pages of words.<br />That isn't all bad.  If you like the sounds that words make (some of the passages really should be read aloud) or if you like the images that can be invoked, there are some enchanting passages in &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  At times, however, there seems to be just endless words - I had to force myself not to resort to skimming in order to get the story being told.  Looking for the story is, to some degree, pointless because Woolf shows no interest in a definite beginning or ending - she ends the work without ending the story.  Perhaps one should say that in this work it really is the journey and not the starting and ending points that is the reason for reading.  At times, Woolf's words have a certain madness about them.  Some say her own madness affected her writing, some say not.  I tend to agree with the former - she herself indicated a certain fondness for the imagery which came to her during her &quot;mad&quot; periods.  Even though she didnot write during those periods, she may well have stored away images to evoke later in her writing just as one can store away vivid images received in dreams.<br />Woolf succeeds in making her characters live in this book, perhaps because Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay are closely modeled on her own parents. One has to remember, though, that they are seen through the eyes of an impressionable daughter and that they died before Woolf developed an adult relationship with them - she was only 13 when her mother died and just 22 when her father died.  Perhaps the ambivalent reactions of the character, Lily, in the story mirror Woolf's own impressions of her parents.  Her characters have no constant viewpoint, just as real people grow cold and warm on different issues and on their relationships with other people in their lives.  They can both detest and love some other person in the course of a day or even in the course of an hour or a minute, having both lovable and irksome, even maddening characteristics.  One of the most interesting &quot;characters&quot; in the story is the house which they rent for each summer.  The house is on a beach and has all the problems and frailties of beach houses of the early 1900's.  The Woolfs were of the British intelligentsia and, although certainly not wealthy, could afford to have a cook and servants.  One might think Woolf would ignore the presence of these menials, as is often the case for such writers, but she doesn't and her treatment of them adds some depth to the story of the house and the times.<br />The most appealing character, to me, is Mrs. Ramsay.  She is a compulsive caretaker who guards her husband's and children's tender feelings from hurt.  Something like a female Don Quixote, she is a guardian of the lonely and shy, even when they don't want a guardian.  Like most of the people who knew her, I came to have an affection for Mrs. Ramsay.<br />If you like history and science writing and have not developed a fondness for writing such as that of Jane Austen, you may not have the patience to enjoy this work.  If you do like Austen and/or if you like poetry, you may very well enjoy reading &quot;To the Lighthouse.&quot;  Even better might be the audio version - just close your eyes and listen to the sound pictures as Woolf flits about the room.
0385486804|3.0|Into the wild is kind of a slow book.  It's starts off and tells how the main character dies in the first ten pages.  The book is kind of back and fourth.  It takes you through all different parts of the story at anytime and it can be very confusing at some points.  The story is also very interesting at some points.  The story can be very surprising because the main character always does the opposite of what a normal person would do.   He is always getting into many different predicaments.  If you like slow jump around kind of books then you love this story by Jon Krakauer.
B00003CXXM|4.0|What a pleasant surprise this was!  I had originally hoped to see this when it came out in the theaters, but the multiple bad reviews I read and the two friends I had who disliked it made me take a pass on it.  Now, I am mystified why people disliked it.  I thought it was a first rate spy thriller.  I had only one serious complaint (a scene in which our hero jumps off an extremely high point holding a corpse underneath him to break the fall:  sorry, a corpse isn't a parachute and wouldn't have kept his body from being crushed by impact).  By and large, it was a thoroughly satisfying spy flick.<br />I never read the Robert Ludlum novel or saw the first version of the film, but I love the premise:  a man is found floating in the Atlantic with two bullets in his back and a tiny canister in his right hip, a canister that contains information about a Swiss bank account.  Gradually, the man, played by Matt Damon, learns that he possesses a perplexing range of skills with languages, fighting, using a gun, being preternaturally aware of his surroundings, and driving a car.  With the help of a young German woman, fetchingly played by RUN LOLA RUN's Franka Potente, he heads off to Paris from Switzerland, where, as they say, the plot thickens.  I like the way that Matt Damon manages to exude a profound sense of self-confusion while learning that his fighting and survival skills were off-the-chart.  He will accidently get into a fight, leaving two or three people severely injured, and he would be profoundly completely rattled by what he had been able to do.<br />I don't want to exaggerate the merits of the film.  It isn't a masterpiece; it is a highly enjoyable spy flick.  Everything is executed well, and of the supporting cast Chris Cooper stands out as Bourne's \\"control\\" in Washington, DC.  I think anyone who enjoys espionage or action films will find this movie well repays the time spent viewing it.
B000001EHS|5.0|Growing up, Def Leppard was hands down my favorite band. I still buy their new albums as well. They are truly great craftsmen when it comes to hooks, production, and memorable, catchy, choruses. They also had a lot of hits to prove it. Some fans will be upset that nothing off of \\"On Through The Night\\" was included. Why? There were no top 40 hits on it. Same with \\"High n' Dry\\". They did include \\"Bringing On The Heartbreak\\", because it was a popular video in the early MTV days. All the hits from \\"Pyromania\\" are represented. \\"Too Late For Love\\" & \\"Rock! Rock!\\" are big songs on rock radio, but they were never singles. Of the seven singles off \\"Hysteria\\", only six made noteworthy appearances on the charts. \\"Women\\" peaked at #80! \\"Adrenalize\\" had four top 40 hits, \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", & \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" were the only top 20 hits. \\"Retro-Active\\" had two singles that made it into the charts, \\"Two Steps Behind\\" & \\"Miss You In A Heartbeat\\". The single from \\"Vault\\", \\"When Love & Hate Collide\\", was actually a top 30 radio hit. So, for those who point out what were and were not hits, the only non-hit was \\"Heartbreak\\", technically. For die-hard fans, this may not be the Lep's best work. But for anyone that appreciates great pop-rock, it's a must have.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|It is unfair to compare the cast of on this DVD recording with the greatest Wagnerian singers of the past. That said, the vocal performance still disappoints in several respects. The Brunnhilde is frankly inadequate as her voice is not heroic enough and there are bad patches of singing in the lower register. Some of the singers are past their prime, sounding worn and tired (like Ludwig's Fricka) and some, while singing gorgeously are simply not convincing in their parts (Norman's Sieglinde leaps to the mind). Others (like the Wotan and Rhinemaidens) are hampered by poor stage direction, and the standard of acting is not too remarkable. Although the orchestra of the Metropolitan orchestra performs extremely well, Levine plodding tempo impedes the forward flow of the drama and severely tested some of the singers. The stage direction is merely adequate and there are some grave disappointments just like the whole of Rheingold and the ending of Gotterdammerung. This renders any viewing of the DVD in long stretches a rather tedious experience.
B00006RIO7|4.0|The cuts from the film were fabulous and make me want to see the movie again and again!  The &quot;bonus&quot; cuts were, for the most part, better left off the CD.  They were obviously filler and I would have preferred encores of &quot;All that Jazz&quot; and &quot;He Loves Me So&quot; to fill that space!
B00004Z459|3.0|Sometimes I really have to wonder. When a band comes out with a CD, and right off the bat hits it big, it really shows how much say MTV and Clear Channel REALLY have in what you like. Though, I'm not going to be totaly negative. While I personaly don't enjoy their music and Chesters half screamed crooning, many people I know seem to. I try and approach things objectivly. While it IS possible that they are trying to express themselfs, lets face it:Appealing to 'teen angst' sells your records. Hell, look at Korn. How many of you out there think it's silly that that guy is STILL whining about his childhood? Move on man. Anyway, I also have a hard time overlooking the &quot;They don't write their own music&quot; rumour that's going around. I have no proof either way, but it makes me cautious. Bottom line here: This is the same old Nu-Metal song and dance with not a lot to offer. You're better off digging past the surface and finding bands that still make music for the sake of music.
0375507507|4.0|A very shatteringly honest depiction of a family's struggle to survive in a hostile environment.  Having spent a month in Africa many years ago,it was easy for me to understand the appeal of that country.  The smells, the scenery and colors are like none anywhere else in the world.  My first reaction to the book was &quot;why would parents want to raise children in such dangerous and potentially fatal surroundings?&quot;  I am certain, however, that Bobo would not have traded her childhood for any pampered &quot;normal&quot; upbringing that could have been provided. Likewise,we her readers, would never have gotten to enjoy this book. <br />I wish the author would have gone into a little more detail about the circumstances that brought her family to Africa and why they persisted in this difficult life, but maybe that is fodder for another book.  Let's hope so!
B00006HBUA|1.0|I didn't watch this by choice and I don't usually like to write such short negative reviews as this but Scooby Doo really is up there with the worst that Hollywood has to offer. It's also hard to understand who this movie was aimed at. True, my six and four year old nephews seemed to enjoy it but then when you are that age a prolonged farting competition between Shaggy and Scooby is probably very funny. However it also has some gay innuendo at the expense of Freddie Prinze's character Fred and its cast seems very obviously aimed at the teen market (surely teenagers don't have that poor a taste)? Of said cast the only performance I can recommend is that of Mathew Lillard as Shaggy who has the voice of the famous cartoon character down to a T. As for Scooby himself I was relatively unimpressed with the CGI canine and I am not at all surprised that Mike Myers decided not to pursue this project. This is a movie with no redeeming qualities and with a sequel planned I'd have to recommend that instead of Scooby Doo, you Scooby don't.
B00005Y228|5.0|The best of her albums. Ever. Gotta have album. Becoming the hit in the states will prove this. This is the album that will make you feel SOOO GOOOD about being alive and still kicking dirt on earth. :)<br />I'm big fan of Kylie. Since I came to America, I always wondered how come nobody knows about her here. I used to buy her albums from overseas through the internet.<br />When I heard \\"Can't get you out of my head\\" on the radio I couldn't believe in my ears. Thanks to loyal fans (and of course, to her evergrowing talent) now she's wellknown in America too.<br />P.S. Check my listmania on Kylie CDs.
B00005JM6E|5.0|This is an outstanding film, far superior in every way to every other version that has ever been filmed, and I especially include the travesty that was filmed in 2002. Don't bother with any of the others, help us convince them to release this on DVD before I wear out another videotape of it!
0375507507|5.0|I can't recommend this highly enough-what a world the author brings to life, what a wonderful sense of humor and vividness she brings to the unlikely situation of growing up in racist Rhodesia where the white-farmers' fondest hope is to continue living in a country ruled by whites.  And, she can really write; superb descriptions of nature, heat, smells, sounds, animals; adventurous and exciting with a moral rift right up the middle of the book.  Terrific stuff.
B00005MAM2|3.0|I have seen this film about 5 or 6 times now and it was the first Anime film I ever saw as it is for many.  The animation is superb and quality of the voice acting is also great.  I thought the world was very well done and the characters were intriguing.  Unfortunately the film is just weird.  I love intelligent films that make you think but this one just didn't seem to have much of a point at all.  I know many people think they get it but a casual viewer will be baffled.  Now most anime is extremely hard to figure out but I have had much better luck with films like Ghost in the Shell and Ninja Scroll.  This film was a groudbreaker in America and started all the hype around foreign Anime so it should not be missed but I just don't buy all the hype that it is the greatest Anime ever made.  There are so many better Anime films you can find if you know were to look.
B00007BK2N|4.0|This is a movie about music. If you don't know who Joy Division were and don't care. Skip this moive. It is best viewed with the \\"real\\" Tony Wison commentary turned on.
B00007H1Y2|4.0|I know very little of Ry Cooder's solo work beyond the Paris, Texas soundtrack; instead, I was a classic yuppie-style sucka for the Buena Vista Social Club project. After the LP debut, much of the solo member follow-ups degraded its charm.  I could never figure out what had happened until I took at listen to this release. In addition to his chops as a first rate world fusion guitarist, Cooder understands recording space like T-Bone Burnett or Tchad Blake.  The location, particular the exotic baggage of politically exiled Cuba are an uncredited additional musician on these tracks. Jerry Boys, the engineer on this album as well as the original BV project, nails the poverty-stricken hollowness of the surroundings, allowing the music to fulfill its purpose.  The reverb is so palpable, it's difficult to believe that it was recorded anywhere but a condemned building. I didn't find the tunes nearly as timeless as those on Buena Vista or even Ibrahim Ferrer's debut, but the ponderous musicianship of the rhythm section and well-wrapped package of Cuban breeze make this a must for would-be world travelers.
B00005JLO2|4.0|The Four Feathers is a very underated film in that it shows the Victorian era of the British empire something that isn't protrayed often by hollywood. The acting is so-so which all the other reviewers will agree with but the story is first rate. Maybe if more established actors had taken up this project or a different director the outcome would have been better. The story is solid and some of the scene's are sort of uplifting in the sense of the courage that is protrayed. I enjoyed the film for the same reasons i enjoyed braveheart or black hawk down for the courage that was protrayed. A film that anyone who enjoyed them must consider viewing.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles' greatest hits set, &quot;1,&quot; is perfect, from beginning to end. Every track is instantly recognizable and would humble Mozart if he was still breathing. &quot;Love Me Do&quot; through &quot;Yesterday&quot; are upbeat classics that showcase the Beatles' ability to master the 50's-style teen anthem or love song, whereas &quot;Day Tripper&quot; through &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; represent the remarkable upgrade in musical sophistication the Beatles experienced from &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; through their masterful swan song, &quot;Abbey Road.&quot; In short, the Beatles' &quot;1&quot; record is perfect. It outshines any greatest hits collection by Madonna or the Queen of Pop. Not one track on this CD fails to hook and hold your attention, and all of these songs were penned by Lennon/McCartney or Harrison.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Here, the musical force behind Alice in Chains shows us his inner demons--alcohol, drugs, family, fame--and the damage they've done. Here, Jerry Cantrell tells us: \\"This is what I've done, what I am, why I'm the worse because of it.\\" Yet through the darkness of the album the listener is paradoxically elevated. In short, we share in his pain and simultaneously rise above it.<br />Bottom line: I would give this eight stars if I could...
B000088E6D|5.0|Wow! That's all I can say! It's about time that young people can enjoy this music too. I may be only 24, but I love this music. & the way he sings all the songs on his C.D. are just amazing.  All my friends are hooked too! (Not to mention, my girlfriend!) David Foster has topped himself & found,yet another amazing voice & an amazing star. We CAN'T WAIT for the next C.D.!!!!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I LUFF this CD.  It is brilliant, better than any other CD I've seen.  <BR>1. Not Gonna Get Us *****  A great song, their beautiful voices are introduced in this first track.<BR>2. All the Things She Said *****  The radio favorite and the first I heard of t.A.T.u.  A powerful song.<BR>3. Show Me Love *****  Fantastic lyrics: may just be my favorite track on the CD.<BR>4. 30 Minutes ***** A beautiful, beautiful cut.  It's deep and sad and...beautiful.<BR>5. How Soon is Now? **** Four stars, I didn't like this cover as much as the other songs on the CD.<BR>6. Clowns ***** Creepy and cool, meets up with standards totally, yo.<BR>7. Malchik Gay ***** A great powerful song with a catchy beat and tune.  Love it.<BR>8. Stars  ***** Beautiful, the Russian in the background makes it all the more enchanting.<BR>9. Ya Shosla S Uma ***** The Russian version of track 2.  I feel it is more passionate than the English version,specially the end.<BR>10. Nos Ne Dagoniat ***** For some reason I like the English version of this better, but still 5 stars.<BR>11. Show Me Love--Ext.  *****  Same review as the one for track 3, luff it.<br />t.A.T.u is a breath of something new, and I adore them.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I had to breathe. The fact that I had just taken my last final, and could have been on my way home for Christmas break meant little to me, because I was standing in line at the Uptown Cinema in Washinton, D.C. waiting to get in to see the movie I had been anticipating for months. I was a little delirious...I had stayed up late studying for my history final, my brother called at 6am eastern time to tell me he had just seen the midnight showing of The Two Towers in California (bloody sneak), I asked what was left of my brain to be of use at 8:30 that morning while I was being tested on ancient Greece, and now I was walking in to a grand film about the second part of a book that had moved me more than any other written work i had ever read. i was a little delerious. I went alone because my friend that was planning to accompany me couldn't wait to get home...obviously she wasn't too excited about the film. I really didn't care, I just wanted to see it. (sigh) I had to breathe. Well I breathed and I saw the film, and this is my reaction:<br />In terms of the book's content, the film wastes a great deal of screen time concerning itself with the Isengard vs. Rohan Battle (at Helm's Deep). Here, Dir. Peter Jackson found it necessary to include stunts like Legolas' surfing down the steps on a shield while he shoots orcs-move, and the completely invented appearance of the Mirkwood Elves who turn up to help out- a scene that caused one viewer I know to thumbs down the film automatically. <br />Sam and Frodo's scenes can be criticized even further, as they progress less then Aragorn's scenes in terms of Tolkien's work. Jackson has saved the appearance of Shelob for Part Three, which is evidentally also where the choices of Master Samwise will play out. Both are seen before Return of the King by the reader of Tolkien's chronology. This is not so troubling as the portrayal of Faramir in the film, who resembles more closely his brother, as he is tempted by the ring and forces it to Gondor, where he finally allows Frodo and Sam to escape with it after a change of heart. Tolkien certainly took care to contrast Faramir drastically with Boromir from the beginning in his work. We'll have to wait for Part III before Sam and Frodo even reach Minas Morgul, so the final part of the trilogy will be eventful to say the least.<br />The character of Gollum turned out interestingly. He was created through methods that have really never been used by Hollywood before. He seems a complete CGI character on the screen, when in fact he is in large part - human actor (played expertly by Andy Serkis). Serkis provided not only all the voiced lines, but also most of the movement and action of the character. Very well done, and thumbs up to Peter Jackson for that, however, in the end i thought Serkis' choice to play Gollum as a sort of sweet schizophrenic with no internal monolgue was a bit off the mark.<br />So why do I want to cry like a baby every time I see this film? I actually did the first two times I saw it. Jackson's skill with direction may superseed his skill with the pen. The emotion and character relationships in this film are phenominal. The sheer power that the emotion emits somehow captures the way I feel when I'm studying Tolkien's works. God only knows how he did it, but he did. Although the Fellowship ended up as a better film, The Two Towers is truly The Lord of the Rings.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a terrific film in the spirt of Spartacus and Ben Hur. The characters are terrific and the script is top notch.  It's a must see!
630542845X|5.0|Not everyone is ready for a leap in faith.  We limit our world to the black and white, forgeting that we are more than this particular body that we inhabit in this life.  POWDER makes you look past the mundane, hate, petty and the trival, to discover beauty that is there if you can really \\"see.\\"  One scene where the Sheriff, Powder (Jeremy) and the Sheriff's haunted vegatative dying wife displays this point nicely .  Powder was the conduit between the husband and wife, discovering that forgiveness and love is what really matters and to discard past misunderstandings.<BR>I was more interested in the message versus's the minor \\"gay innuendo\\" which some people may linger on, especially in our homophobic society.<BR>The movie is a REAL MESSAGE movie and it makes you wonder that WE are more than our fear and physical body, ready to be released.
B000067CPX|5.0|I don't like the chili peppers as a band but i really like all the members indiviually. As a musician and someone that claims to have a good ear i can say for sure that these are some of the best musicians active today in the alternative music scene.<BR>old chili albums were more funky and that's how most people grow to like them - funk-rock band but now, more mature, the band has a new style going on that started in californication and yes i know many people said that the band ended as far as they care because an album by a band like that selling in number one place at these times got sold out. right? i don't think so really.<BR>i think that the new music style is something that got the peppers many new fans and some angry hardcore funk fans but that's a small price to pay for doing what you like.<BR>i think anyone that expects from a band to sound the same after 10 years is either stupid or is listening to some bad music.<BR>now i know that many people will stop right now but the thing you need to do is open up a little bit and give the album a chance because it's fantanstic - like 100 times better than californication and a little more funky as well not talking about well recorded with great solid and melodic songs with that feel only this band can provide.
B00005JLRR|1.0|This movie proves than money can't buy everything.  It had some decent special effects but no decent storyline or dialog. At the beginning of the movie, we find Picard standing on an alien planet with Data-like android parts scattered in 4 or 5 places - an arm here, a leg there, and a head somewhere else. Picard says \\"Something isn't right about this.\\" Really, Jean-Luke? What was your first clue?  I think the disembodied android was a metaphor of the movie to come.  The rest of the movie was just as disjointed and never came together.  Maybe the android was in one piece before the editors started whacking away.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' sound is very haunting and it really made me take pause when I heard a clip played on CNN. I instantly became a big fan. I like the fact that the music seems to be sort of a Jazz / Country hybrid that's very moody and soothing. I'm glad to say that I became a fan before I realized that she is the daughter of Ravi Shankar. I am a huge Ravi fan but that had no influence on my liking Norah's music. I look forward to hearing more from this young artist! It would be sort of neat if she and her sister Anoushka recorded something together. Hhhmmm, Jazz/Country/Sitar music... Why not!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I heard about t.A.T.u about half a year ago from a friend. I heard a lot of their Russian songs, and I loved all of them. That's why I was so excited to hear that they were coming out with a English album. It's hard to put t.A.T.u's music in a certian musical category, it's a mix of lots of kinds of music. The lyrics to their songs are great. I'm bisexual so I can relate so most of the songs, but even my friends who are straight can find something that they can relate to. I can't pick one song that stands out on the album, they are all amazing! Anyone who has enjoyed their first single off this album, \\"All The Things She Said\\", will enjoy this album. <br />So, if you are still debating whether to get '200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane', go ahead and get it! I promise you won't be disappointed!
0385720920|5.0|If you're only reading Palahniuk's books because you thought that Fight Club was a cool movie, then stop. You should probably reconsider whether you really want to read anything at all. Why not go watch a traffic accident instead?<br />This isn't a feel good book, nor does it have large explosions, but what it does is make you think, which is what any good book should do. Victor Mancini is not just a man down on his luck, not just \\"an anti-hero for our deranged times\\", not just a modern day saint. He is a man who does all the wrong things for all the right reasons and then goes back and does all the right things for the wrong reasons.<br />Or vice versa.<br />This book may have some elements in common with Fight Club, but it elaborates on different issues. It touches more upon the effects of being the child of rebellious parents, it delves far deeper into the topic of support groups than Fight Club did. It even mentions, on a few occasions, the growing levels of misandry among today's female population.<br />And it has a twist ending that will leave you questioning everything.<br />What's not to like?
0060278269|5.0|The un-named trilogy of Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen is probably the best  one ever written. You learn about five of the many unanswered questions that come up in Sabriel and Lirael. Such as what Touchstone's real name is. Also who the Dog and Mogget really are and what happened in the Beginning. If you liked sabriel and Lirael, then this will be the best book that you have EVER read. It starts off on teh very first page and never stops until the very end. With many secrets that appear out of nowhere, and wonderfully suspensful endings to chapters you have to keep reading forever, or at least untill you're done. I read that book non stop from the second I bought it untill like 12 hours later when I finished it. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to read.
0066214122|3.0|When I first started reading this, I thought it was going to be very good. The set-up was very interesting, getting to know the protagonist, and his situation and background. There was enough science to make it seem believable, but not so much to make it slow down the story.<br />However, when the story got going, I thought it fell apart somewhat. There were many times when the characters did things that just didn't seem to make much sense based on the situation. And the main conflict just didn't keep me as interested as I had been leading up to it. <br />Also, I'm not a big fan of illogical coincidences that play a crucial role in the plot. Like Jack having written the code that his wife's company was using, it was a little too convenient. I think the story would have worked much better if that had been presented differently.<br />Finally, the end seemed to drag on quite a bit. I felt like I knew pretty much what would happen, but it took too long getting there.<br />Overall, I thought the premise was very interesting and the characters were good, but the ending seemed a little predictable and it was too slow. I enjoyed reading it, but the beginning made me expect more from the end than I got.
0060005424|5.0|OMI!!! this was the BEST book in the world. Only Sabriel and Abhorsen are at the same level as Lirael. With so much to read you just CANNOT stop until you are completely finished! With the brand new creature the Dog you are immediatly surprised and taken in by the magic. It was so good but it poses so many questions. How did Arielle die? Who is Mogget? and such.If you have read Sabriel than you should most certainly read this. It is kinda confusing at first but that alone is not enough to take away from such an amazing book. ENJOY!

B000063V8T|5.0|After the third and fourth season, STAR TREK: TNG showed no intention of slowing down. And it never did.<br />The fifth season stars out with REDEMPTION: PART II. The fourth and last part of the rough quadrilogy involving Worf is by far the best of them all. It starts with a spaceship fight and never lets up. 10 times better than the first part.<br />What made this season so great was that it had many guest stars and character-based episodes:<br />1) In THE GAME and DARMOK, Ashley Judd guest stars. <br />2) Leonard Nimoy returns as Spock in UNIFICATION, PART II. There is a priceless conversation between Data and Spock in that episode.<BR>3) Kelsey Grammer makes a brief apperance in CAUSE AND EFFECT.<BR>4) Famke Janssen appears in THE PERFECT MATE. (She would later star with Patrick Stewart in X-MEN)<BR>5) Ray Walston makes a memorable appearance in THE FIRST DUTY. Will Wheaton is in that episode as well and delivers a great performance. <BR>6) In THE NEXT PHASE, La Forge and Ro get some time to deliver some good performances<BR>7) ETHICS is a great Worf episode.<br />Also in this season were many funny and intersting episodes:<br />1) In DISASTER, Data's head is removed, Worf helps to deliver a baby, and Troi must run the bridge. Good stuff.<BR>2) In POWER PLAY, Data, Troi, and O'Brien go renegade and take over Ten-Forward. Very cool.<BR>3) I, BORG was a great episode. Very intersting. And watch for Hugh to come back late in the 6rth season...<br />Unfortunately, there were some bad episodes as well. IMAGINARY FRIEND and COST OF LIVING were horrible. Watch for yourself. (LWAXANA taking a MUD BATH?!?!?!?! Please, no!!!!!!!)<br />And last, the season's last episode, TIME'S ARROW. Unfortunately, it's not that great. Data accidentally goes back in time and meets Jack London, Mark Twain, and others while trying to stop aliens (again). Some of it is funny, but you're gonna have to wait until the end of the 6th season for a REALLY GREAT SEASON FINALE.<br />All in all, a great and crucial season. <br />1991-1992; all episodes are rated PG for mild sci-fi violence and breif language.
B000002E5J|5.0|Este disco en serio me parece el mejor disco de toda la carrera de Shakira y tambin uno de mis favoritos, si no es mi favorito de mi lista de mis mejores discos de la historia, es simplemente increble ya que en esas pocas Shakira era simplemente una nia y realmente cantaba con el corazn, no como en su segundo disco que se volvi demasiado rockera ni en su tercer disco el unplugged que fu una basura y su ltimo disco que a pesar de haber tenido xito, no canta realmente lo que siente, en cambio en este disco, los sonidos pop junto con su voz y sus letras hacen que las canciones suenen increbles, se los recomiendo a todos aunque no sean fans de Shakira les aseguro que despus de escuchar este disco van a querer ms de Shakira, aunque lamentebalemente este es el nico disco bueno de Shakira pero de todos modos pueden disfrutarlo, se los recomiendo, cmprenlo y les aseguro que terminarn con ms de una sonrisa al final y no se cansarn nunca de escuchar las canciones, por eso obviamente merece cinco estrellas.

B00000J6AG|1.0|The first track starts off with &quot;Gunna Hunny Gum Bay&quot; (or whatever it is that they're saying)... and I kept waiting for it to change; but it never did. Sure, he added some drums in later--but is this MUSIC? NO. &quot;Gunna Hunny Gum Bay&quot; repeated somewhere around 124 times in 3:30 is just... it's a waste of time both to listen to and to have produced.<br />My main problem is with Moby--the guy has the biggest ego on earth, but he makes such BAD MUSIC... how can anyone who churns out tracks like Run On even believe for a second that he has any talent whatsoever? Even if his music was good, he thinks far too highly of himself. It's sad what fame does to people...<br />Moving on, we come to tracks such as Find My Baby.. in which the same thing happens. Take a dead person's music, loop it without any changes, add in a drum, and repeat the same boring sound over and over again for as long as you can stand. And in this case, Moby's tolerance for the utterly mindless repetition of the same sounds and drums over and over and over again is far higher than most people's.<br />I can't imagine the kind of people who really enjoy music like this. You have a single sample, played at the very beginning of the song, that just continuously loops over and over again; with slight drums and orchestrated &quot;sweeps&quot;, but it's not... this isn't MUSIC.<br />Porcelain is a much better track, but again it goes nowhere. However, it sounds good, so I'm not so concerned.<br />Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad? does the same pattern--completely mindless, nonchanging rhythms and single sample.<br />Southside is totally different, and I don't happen to particularly like it, but at least it's something you can LISTEN to.<br />In the interest of time, I'll highlight some extra tracks--Machete is actually not so bad, but again it's INCREDIBLY repetitive and got boring after the second listen...<br />The rest of the album is mostly ambient pieces that go nowhere. I thought it was great how I could skip around all I wanted with my CD player and not notice a single actual change in any of these pieces no matter how hard I tried to find it. A string sweep for 4 minutes is NOT exactly my definition of a good song...<br />And then we come to Everloving. And no matter what prejudice you have against the guy, and his ego, and his music... Everloving is an astounding track. Truly, life-changingly astounding. The fact that it's made by this guy makes me even more frustrated. But the fact remains--that song is amazing. Standing out amidst all this other hideous repetition, it seems like someone else's song--knowing Moby, it probably is.<br />Download Everloving, and if you love it, don't get the album. No other track is anything like it.<br />In short... don't buy this album. Spend your money on something more meaningful than a loop and a drum sample repeated over and over again for an hour and six minutes.

B000084T18|4.0|50 cent is straight.  This album is better than the rest of his albums.  Eminem and Dre are going to blow this cat up.  He got some tight lyrics.  He can flow with the best of them.  If you don't have this album, you need to go get it now!
B00003CXXM|4.0|Ludlum's stock and trade plot development involved a man caught in extraordinary circumstances with all sorts of people trying to kill him.<br />Certainly, the Bourne Identity was one of Ludlum's better books, and the movie captures the helter-skelter, holding on by the edge of your finger tips tension found in the novel.<br />Matt Damon continues to surprise me with his ability to enter into different roles and pull it off. His performance as Jason Bourne is great. I particularily liked the scene in the Swiss bank where he opens up the security box and finds a dozen passports and lots of cash.<br />The fight sequences were believable (unlike the trend towards using wires and performing impossible jumps). <br />The DVD talks about an alternate ending, but I wasn't all that impressed with.<br />I appreciated the director's commentary.
B000053GTF|5.0|This collection of videos featured on VH-1 is a God-send for those of us who don't subscribe to cable or satellite tv.  Celine's singing ability is world-renowned but I find her acting ability to be spectacular as well.  And, the songs taken from her live concerts are fabulous.  Give yourself a great present and buy this dvd.  It and Celine is a wonderful evening of entertainment from the best singer on the planet.
B0000844IT|5.0|*THIS REVIEW IS IN REFERENCE TO THE NEW \\"BOOMSTICK EDITION\\" TWO DISK SET*<br />Ok, if you're on this page, there's a good chance you've already seen this movie and are torn between purchasing another copy or not.<br />If you already have the Bootleg Edition, or one of the many other editions of this film that have been released over the years, then you're probably going to feel jipped after you read this. Sorry.<br />Anyways, what this DVD set basically includes is two previously released DVDs in one package. Those being the standard edition and the Bootleg edition. Which, if you're looking to upgrade from your old VHS copy or something, it's a really good deal. Since buying the two DVDs seperately would cost a lot more than just buying this package. For the person who already has an AOD DVD I wouldn't recommend, unless you really want the directors cut version of it since you'd probably end up with two copies of the same DVD. But if you're a hardcore fanatic and are feeling like shelling out the asking price for the nifty new 8 page collectors booklet. Go for it. That's what I'm buying it for. The fact that the \\"Bootleg\\" edition didn't come with the theatrical ending is also a reason I'm purchasing this DVD set.<br />I give it five stars because...Well, it's a great film and though it may be a little late for a release like this, it's the thought that counts. Thanks Anchor Bay.

B000001DQI|5.0|This truly is a marvelous album and certainly one of Elton's finest recordings. Each and every song is wonderful in its own right though Benny and the Jets just isn't as strong as it once was and some songs are kinda boring like I've Seen That Movie Too, but even so the album doesn't suffer from their inclusions at all. I have gotten somewhat tired of it overall, but some songs do indeed still send chills down my spine when I hear them. All in all Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just a truly remarkable album that everyone should own. Elton John is one of the world's greatest performers and this album definitely stands the test of time. Wonderful, just wonderful.

B000001EGA|4.0|I won't even say that this is his best album, because it definitely is not, but it is great for what it is, and it is very enjoyable to listen to. Plus you get Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and Philadelphia Freedom which are almost worth the price alone.
0316666343|1.0|Kept reading, waiting to understand why this book is so popular. <BR>Completely disappointed. Far from a shining star, Sebold is simplistic and boring. Didn't care a whit for anyone. And the lead detective is going to seduce the victim's mother? Puhleeze.
B000001EXB|4.0|Elton's The Big Picture while certainly not on par with his other truly great albums is good overall and I do recommend it if only to get to hear the longer regular versions of Something About the Way You Look Tonight and Recover Your Soul. I was pleasantly surprised by it and felt overall pleased. But after owning it for a few months now I just don't care for it like I used to. It's still a good album, but one which I don't care to listen to all that much anymore. Get it if you're a fan of his, but his other 90s album Made in England is much better.
B000089A07|3.0|Perhaps it was me comparing this movie with it's earlier version, 'Manhunter', but I just didn't buy the acting.  Edward Norton is a fantastic actor, but after seeing William Petersen in the role of Will Graham, Ed just didn't make me believe it. 'Red Dragon' does follow the book closer, but rarely will you find a movie that does justice to the print that inspires it. I believe 'Silence' to be a better film and 'Hannibal' just plain sucked.  If you're a Hopkins fan as I am, 'Hannibal' probably left you with a bad taste in your mouth; however, this one does go a long way in redeeming the Hannibal character.<br />PS. Tom Noonan IS the Tooth Fairy!  Sorry Ralph.
B000066JES|1.0|Not much to say here.  I have been a loyal fan of this true metal band since the beginning when I was a little lad rockin my noggin.  I guess all metal must rust, for this album is pretty awful. What happened to these guys.  Have they been hangin out with N-SYNC?  I mean, this is mellow to where it hurts and the hevy tunes are just boring and horrible re-runs of Manowars good songs of the past.  If you are a true lover of Manowar, you may break up with them after hearing this.<br />What an upsetting CD.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Sheesh!  Never ask a girl with no sense of humor to the prom!
B00006RU5B|2.0|I mean, with all the rockers on this album, why did it turn out so lame and predictable?  Its basically Sound Garden.  The songs are all forgettable and the ballads are too many and boring.  You would think that this would be one of the greatest albums of the year?  Cornells vocals are still mellifluous and amzing and Morello's guitar rocks............but it just doesnt combine well to make a great album..........<br />boo hoo

6301963717|5.0|This is Ethan and Joel's best work ever.  They have done a gangster movie in fantastic style.<br />Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden and Coen-favorite John Turturro are simply excellent.  This movie is gritty and dark and wonderful.  Get it now!
B000005RS9|4.0|Here's the minor bit of bad news, first:  <br />A bar was cut out of the upbeat &quot;Flaming&quot; -- you know, that very nice key twist over the ending -- but the overall song still works.<br />Also, a clumsy bit of organ is bumping around the intro to &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;.  And that's all the complaints I have!<br />Otherwise, I suspect you'll find this mix a bit &quot;jucier&quot;, a bit more guitar-ish, overall more pleasing!  By all means, one should own the standard stereo release, but this import is definitely worth obtaining, even in used condition at a significant price.  If I'm not mistaken, it's also the only mix Syd, Rog, Rick and Nick participated in.  And, admit it, you always felt those ham-fisted panning effects in the stereo version were a bit silly, didn't you?<br />The whole point is to pretend it's an acid-glistening, London-swinging 1967, isn't it?  Well, it was all mono back then, so let's get with the program!
B00004YW6I|3.0|Polly, what happened? Did Vincent Gallo make you do this?<br />I loves you, Peej, so why'd you have to go &amp; get all Liz Phair on me?<br />You made a very boring album.

You're not; you're a raw nerve, a musical kick in the head, innovative &amp; scary. A designer dress and a new haircut shouldn't change this.<br />Happiness doesn't have to mean being bland &amp; dull!<br />I'll still buy your albums, Polly, but c'mon, leave the indie hipster act behind &amp; get back to blowing our minds.<br />Love,<br />Linda

0375414053|5.0|It seems that most of the reviews have come in from married women with kids, working or not.  The reveiws are more sociology than criticism.  But, hey, it strikes a nerve.<br />I am the HUSBAND of a Kete Reddy plus plus, and we have seven, count them seven children.  Not easy, but in the broad sense, well worth it. She's a workaholic, and would be unhappy dealing all day with the kids.    <BR> <BR>This is how Kate Reddy does it: her husband. Even if he is unable to bring up the laundry, she should have been a LOT nicer to him.  Obviously, Richard was doing a helluva lot to make things work for her (who was keeping the home finances, bills, shopping, driving the kids, etc.). You see ladies, its not that he did not want to bring up the laundry from the bottom of the stairs: He's congenitally blind to it, just as I am.  We just can't help it, honest!  It's all in the hard wiring.  My advise to the Kate Reddy's out there: get over it.  Just ask nicely, don't lose your cool, be understanding of our basic needs (even if you can't always fulfill them), and maybe he will remember to bring up the laundry.  And if he forgets, well, worse things can happen.  <br />Bravo to Allison Pearson, a modern Balzac.
0316666343|3.0|I began reading The Lovely Bones and thought Alice Sebold had a great idea -- the story of a girl who is in heaven watching her family go on with their lives without her.  I could not put the book down.  It sent a bittersweet message to me regarding heaven and earth -- how similar they are meaning that in both worlds, you can never get what you really want.  The book disturbed me, though, and I don't see how the bones were tied into the story.

Touching The Void is a very compelling story about mans determination and will to survive no matter what Mother Nature dishes out. Joe Simpson gives an excellent narrative that grabs the reader and gets them asking for more. Touching The Void takes place high in the Andes Mountains. Joe Simpson and his climbing partner Simon Yates just reached the top of a 21,000-foot summit when disaster strikes. Everything was going great for the two climbers. They were both overjoyed with their accomplishment when all of a sudden their world fell apart both literally and figuratively. This was a good book<BR>definitely worth reading.

The only part about this movie that I didn't like was that Faramir was a badguy. I thought that the Ents were terriffic.Sean Astins(SAM)performance really shined, as did Orlando Bloom's and Ian McKellan's, plus Gimli was very funny! I really didn't like the love triad Eowyn and Arwen and Aragorn made but, you know, it had to be put in. This movie was so awsome! Anyone who sais otherwise must be a total stinker, party pooper, and a general grump. Again, this movie really shined!
B000002NHN|5.0|I refer not only to voice quality, but to the material that that voice sings. Loreena McKennit's &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; is an auditory treasure, a lush collection of songs that conjure up incense, velvet drapes, medieval castles and exotic lands. Written as a result of the wanderlust that took her across the world, her &quot;mosaic&quot; is a musical treasure.<br />The prologue is a hint of what's to come, with eerie, drum-accented music and soft singing (nothing more complicated than &quot;la&quot; and &quot;na&quot;). &quot;The Mummer's Dance&quot; is a haunting, almost mystical trip: &quot;Who will go down to the shady groves/and summon the shadows there.&quot; Then we lapse into the steady melancholy of a monastary in &quot;Skellig,&quot; where we hear a lament of many years and of endings (&quot;the daylight is almost gone/the birds have sung their last/the bells call all to Mass&quot;).<br />&quot;Marco Polo&quot; is an exotic instrumental interwoven with a Sufi melody. Then we go into the realm of poetry, where the tragic poem &quot;The Highwayman,&quot; about a bandit and his doomed sweetheart, set to rising music. &quot;La Serendissima&quot; is a steadier, less sad melody. &quot;Night Ride Across the Caucasus&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;Dance,&quot; because of its hauntingly surreal imagery. And &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; is a surefire way to stir your tears, with the funereal music and unspeakably sad chorus: &quot;Cast your eyes to the ocean/cast your soul to the sea/when the dark night seems endless/please remember me.&quot;<br />Loreena McKennit's music has a depth that many other singers like Enya and Charlotte Church lack; there's a feeling of weight and history, which is only made greater by her use of material like &quot;Danyte's Prayer.&quot; Part of her skill is in taking various bits that she acquired across Asia, the Middle-East and Europe, and weaving them together into a tapestry of sound. Violins, drums, mandolins, mandolas, pianos and cellos are included in the music (there are apparently electric guitars as well, but I can't figure out where they are).<br />My main complaint with this album? It's too short! There are only eight songs, and while the richness of them is overwhelming, I was left hungry for more. Nevertheless, those who are searching for something intriguing and archaic-feeling should listen to &quot;Book of Secrets.&quot; You will come away with the song of angels in your mind.d cellos are included in the music (there are apparently electric guitars as well, but I can't figure out where they are).<br />My main complaint with this album?

B00008972S|5.0|When you take a great composer, a great lyricist, a great choreographer, a great director, a pretty talented young acting team, and a story with universal themes and a respect for the pacing and structure of classical theatre, it is impossible not to produce one of the greatest films of all time.<br />I can understand a younger audience being less than enthralled about listening to a lot of dialogue in the vernacular idioms of a previous generation, but this film is hardly timebound. Most know of the Romeo and Juliet plot dramatized with typical Hell's Kitchen, New York street gangs, one Puerto Rican the other more native, of the post-war fifties, and this is hardly incidental to the story. The war between the better and lesser angels of our nature play out the same way regardless of time or place in history. Modern drama at times has attempted to define tragedy as a morally ambiguous universe, but the drama has classically been treated as a means of elevating our appreciation for innate moral and spiritual truths by exploring the tragic consequences of one or more of them being absent.<br />Unique as a musical tragedy, the film's lyrics and melodies continuously shiver from jazzed-up tough urban desperation to lyrics conveying a fragile hope and longing. But the hope never survives very long before the insane, self-destructiveness of these gangs,  desperately attempting to create esteem for themselves by projecting evil onto each other, climaxes in violence, then again in vengeance.<br />Performances are excellent all-around, with one especially worth praising. Many years ago The Harvard Lampoon found Natalie Wood's acting ability a subject for mockery, which says more about spoiled, more-enlightened-than-thou pseudo-intellectuals than the late, beautiful actress. Ms. Wood's performance as Maria could not have been greater if God had sent a clandestine angel to play the part. A prettier or more tender face in the love scenes is difficult to imagine. And in the final scene, as in classical theatre where a protagonist attempts to explain the tragic situation through experiencing a range of emotions without overlapping them, Maria wavers from anger to tenderness to resignation, to weeping, to a wondering and pleading countenance that inspires, for the moment at least, a recognition from both warring gangs a common humanity in tragedy. If this scene doesn't tug a heartstring, check your pulse daddyo.
B00005N83M|1.0|I am a fan of Jennifer Lopez as an actress, but she is not a singer. Recording technology can't even cover up her lack of singing abilities. She has proved she can't sing on her albums and live. Her albums only prove that the music industry is not about talent anymore.
0679745653|5.0|Next to Truman Capote's masterpiece, In Cold Blood, is his wildly famous and absolutely delightful novella, Breakfast at Tiffany's.  The book's fame has been catapulted by the classic film with Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard.  While the movie follows the novella fairly closely, there are some significant differences between the two works.  I will not reveal them here.<br />In Holly Golightly, Tiffany's central character, Truman Capote has created his self-stated favorite character, a charming yet flighty high-class call girl.  The book follows Holly's nights of debauchery with days of conversations and activities with a writer (narrator as well).  Some plot elements involving mobsters, a person from Holly's past, a Latin playboy and a few other minor characters tie the story together into an entertaining tale.  But the true joy with this book is the time the reader will spend with Holly.  Despite her different station in life, readers will identify with her fears, hopes and desires for comfort (the source of the book's title).  Furthermore, Capote's leisurely style of writing makes the work far more engaging.<br />If you have some brief free time, this brilliant work will be a lovely way to spend a quiet afternoon.

B0000025GW|1.0|I remember buying this album the week it came out in 1979.  I also remember how disappointed I was with its banal lyrics and  Christian message, which seemed so much at variance with Dylan's free-thinking genius.  Mark Knopfler's irritating guitar playing is particularly intrusive, making all the tracks sound very similar.  In retrospect, this album marks the end of Dylan's great period.  He would continue to record great songs (including some religious songs, such as &quot;Every grain of sand&quot;) but no more great albums (not even 2001's  much touted &quot;Love and theft&quot;).
B00005Y8CF|5.0|this is a great album,with or without the fancy package. the limited edition of Amnesiac is the same music that you get from the normal Amnesiac cd...only it comes inside of a book full of artwork not found in the regular insert. basicly you are buying a Stanely Donwood &amp; Tchocky book + Radiohead, there are no addtional songs..just alot more artwork than the normal cd.<BR>This is excellent if you are a huge radiohead fan (like me) &amp; you enjoy Donwood's art (like me)...but if you arn't interseted in allthat fluff...just get the normal version.

Darby Shaw is an innocent student of law who comes up with a theory as to who committed murders, and she calls this the Pelican Brief.  Unbenownced to her, she has uncovered the true murderers.  When they get a hold of her brief, her world changes drastically.  Grisham uses a tactic where he leads the reader in one direction and then suddenly the story goes a different direction.  We come to realize that this type of device used by Grisham often makes us keep reading because we want to find out what is going to happen to the character in the next scene.<br />At the beginning of the novel, Grisham lacks the use of suspension.  This makes it hard for us to read when we have no real drastic change that quickly changes our point of view.  As soon as Thomas Callahan dies from a car explosion we come to realize that Darby's life is at stake.  When she is scared and is living in hotels where anyone can find her, we are left in suspense where we don't know what is going to happen to her.  Later on in the novel, we follow Darby and Gray Grantham through the underground just waiting for them to be caught.  <br />In the end the device of suspense is what keeps the reader interested throughout the novel.  It keeps us waiting to find out if the good or the evil of the world will win the battle.  Any part of a novel without suspense, which we discover in the beginning, is not keeping our attention.  Once our opinions keep changing we keep wanting to read more and more about how the character ends up.  Suspension helps make us more open to new opinions and quick changes in our own world; although, Grisham uses this to make us more attentive to his story.
B000002JPA|5.0|This album rocks from beginning to end.  I don't want to get indepth here about all the intricacies of this album, that you'll have to do yourself, but trust me, this is one of those albums that you can't miss; especially, the monster instrumental section in the middle of Metropolis Pt.1.

B000002HK4|5.0|ACOS is one of the best long form songs of all time.  If not for that song, get this album to study arrangement because the rest of the album is covers and the Medley at the end is one of my favourite examples of good Medley arrangement.
B00006RU5B|4.0|The first time I've ever heard of the band Audioslave I thought it was just another rock band.  That was until I read the specifics.  ...replacing De La Rocha for Chris Cornell was a brilliant move.  I've been listening to Rage Against the Machine ever since they were on the Godzilla Soundtrack, everything from that band sounded great except for one thing, the singer.  Zack's screams and raps were ear bleeding and unstandable.  Plus adding Cornell to the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine made it sound more like rock or metal than rap.
B00005UEAR|4.0|With the exeption of Disappear, everything else on this CD is nothing short of amazing.  I do however feel that Jordan's MIDI work at the beginning of disk 2 leaves much left to be desired.  I think Michael Romeo did a better job of programming the MIDI parts of The Odyssey than Jordan did on this album.  However, I must say that Jordan is one of the most pleasant people one could ever hope to meet and is also by far the most talented and precise keyboard player I have ever seen.
B000089RV6|5.0|OK, this is the sixth copy of this incredible album that I've purchased over the years(one copy on vinyl, one casette, one regular CD, one digitally remastered CD and my Bonfire copy).  This one feels like a brand new album.  The sound quality is much improved even over the remasters that were done in 1994.  And the packaging is amazing.  When I opened the CD for the first time and saw the picture of the band onstage I almost climaxed.  There they were, the worlds greatest rock band onstage during the absolute peak of their career.  I think everyone knows the drill as far as this album is concerned.  If not, here's how Guitar magazine summed it up when they rated it as the #5 album of the 1980's,<br />\\"If this record doesn't move you you're probably dead.  Back In Black, produced by the brothers Young, is a terrifyingly brutal metal record.  Songs like \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Hells Bells\\" and the title track sound like they were performed by a pack of crazed wolverines touched by the hand of God.  You've heard of rhythm and blues?  This is rhythm and bruise.\\"<br />I can't think of anything else to add except THANK YOU SONY!!!!!
B00006L83N|5.0|I can't believe, and still can't believe that the overture to the title track is MIDI!!!!!!!  Wow!!!!!!  These guys did an amazing job!  It sounds so much better than the MIDI work of Jordan Rudess for Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (Dream Theater) or the new Stratovarius, Elements Pt.1, that actually utilized a real symphony.  I do want to make it clear that Jordan is by far the best keyboard talent I have ever met, seen, or heard play, but his work just does not match that of Romeo for this particular album.<br />The album totally rocks from beginning to end and sweeps you on a journey that you will want to revisit many times; however, the catch being that no one journey will be exactly like the last.
B000021YQV|5.0|WHEN I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM I WAS SIMPLY INSLAVED BY THE VOCALS AND THE HYPNOTIC RYTHEMS OF THE BAND. AFTER I LISTENED TO THIS WORK OF ART, I SAW THE LIGHT AND I SAW THE INNERVISION DEEP INSIDE OF MY SOUL THAT WAS TRYING TO ESCPAE. THIS MASTERPIECE OF DEVIN VOCALS AND LYRICS SET MY SOUL FREE FROM THE PRISON IT WAS HELD INSIDE OF. I DEEPLY WOULD RECOMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS TRYING TO FIND THE INNER LIGHT INSIDE THEMSELVES.
B000002JKA|5.0|Eventhough this quintet called DT does not have the millions and millions of fans that Metallica has, this band has so much more to offer.  DT is musically more interesting.  Lyrically, more artistic.  And in terms of musicianship...well, let's just say that there aren't a whole bunch of people out there that could pull this stuff off as cleanly and easily as DT does.
076781326X|4.0|Famed British director Carol Reed was more known for his dark psychological thrillers like Odd Man Out and the brilliant The Third Man, so when he was tapped to director the film version of the hit musical Oliver, it seemed like an unusual choice.  But the film turned out to be a roaring success.  The musical was an adaptation of Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist which follows the story of a nine-year old orphan, Oliver (Mark Lester), who is recruited by another orphan, The Artful Dodger (Jack Wild), to join a gang of pickpockets working for the unscrupulous Fagin (Ron Moody) and the murderous and reviled Sikes (Oliver Reed, the director's nephew).  Mr. Reed does a brilliant job through the first part of the film, relating the story almost exclusively through song and dance numbers including the wonderful \\"Food, Glorious Food\\", \\"Boy For Sale\\" and \\"Consider Yourself\\".  The second half of the film gets bogged down by some stilted dialogue and less musical numbers, but overall, the film is charming entertainment.  The cast is excellent, led by the young Mr. Wild, who is dead on as the Dodger and Mr. Moody who hits all the right notes as Fagin.  Both were nominated for Acting Oscars, Mr. Wild in Best Supporting category and Mr. Moody for Best Actor.  In all, the film garnered eleven Academy Award nominations in 1968 and won six including Best Picture, a Best Director award for Mr. Reed and an honorary Oscar for Onna White for her superb choreography which may be the true star of the film.
B000002HPT|4.0|Despite the fact that some people refer to this this album as &quot;falling into s**t&quot;, I find that there are so many brilliant moments on this record.  I like New Millenium, Lines in the Sand, and Just Let Me Breathe.  However the track that I enjoy the most on the record is Anna Lee.  The haunting mood and lyric of this song never leave me completely.  Most people I know actually hate that particular piece, but to me I find it most ironic that it did not become a radio hit...shame on radio programmers.
B000051Y0G|5.0|I have some firmly ingrained memories of Cyndi Lauper and her music from the past. One was crowding around the television with my friends, marveling at early '80's cable TV. It actually had a station called MTV, that played music clips all day! (Does MTV even do that anymore?) We were all mesmerized by this one especially colorful and bouncey video called &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;. It featured a high spirited, unusual looking singer, who definitely danced to her own drummer! Not to long after that I saw Cyndi in concert. The show started with a swooosssshh!! Cyndi entered the venue flying over our heads in a garbage can connected to a cable, that went down to the stage. I don't think I'll ever forget that entrance! Luckily, Cyndi had the musical chops to back up her theatrics. &quot;She's so Unusual&quot; is one of the cornerstone albums of 1980's pop music. With her Betty Boop-like voice, catchy tunes, and a multitude of 'New Wave' synthesisers, Cyndi created a classic album that is still loads of fun.Its hard to keep straight how many hit songs came out of this musical confection. From the Prince penned &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; to the monster hit &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; to that ode to self-gratification known as &quot;She Bop&quot;, they all are just so good! One song that is particularly special to my wife and I is the beautiful ballad &quot;Time after Time&quot;. This was the first song we danced too (by request) at our wedding. For the past decade we have always considered it 'Our Song'. Yes, this album really does brings back some wonderful memories. These days I still often pop &quot;She's So Unusual&quot; into the CD player. The music is as fresh and lively, as when I first heard it over twenty years ago!
B000059ZLH|4.0|This DVD is a good live DVD, but I find the editing to be choppy at times.  I wish it flowed better and that it would actually contain the entire evening like on the live album.  DT always rocks live.  This just doesn't do them justice at 100%.  I'd say it does them justice only at about 85%.<br />If the guys of DT ever read this, I hope you can pitch in an idea for a full length movie on the story line and throw in Metropolis Pt. 1 in to the mix.  Infact, I find that if you go from Regression to Pt. 1 and then kick in to the overture, it works like magic.
1881273156|5.0|This book was recommended by our pastor at church. My husband and I both read the book and refer back to it often. He actually finished reading the book before me. And while I was reading, he was over my shoulder reading along with me (his second time). Reading books like this open up communication in a relationship and in turn, opens up your heart to one another. Friends of ours were asking how and why we seem so happy these days and I would tell them it was because this book helped us become a happier couple together. Since then a number of our friends have borrowed my copy, read the book,and then bought their own copy for future reference. What a wonderful book this is! I'm now working on The Five Love Languages of Children and I love it as well. My 10 year old daughter reads it with me. Both of these books have been 'bonding' books; you read it with the one you love and it brings you so much closer! You can't go wrong with that!!
B00007LL7O|3.0|I'm a finn and usually praise people of my home country, but this time, I found Stratovarius boring.  YES...I know...but after track six, I could not listen to more.  It is musically up to par. I mean if you take harmonic meaning and arangement talent in to count.  But this album just doesn't keep me interested long enough to go through it in one go.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave is an average band.  The singing from Chris Cornell doesn't fit the instrumental style of the band.  You want to hear something exciting, except the c.d. doesn't throw any suprises at you.  I was expecting the songs to be more like old Rage songs, but they weren't one bit like them.  There aren't any great songs except for Cochise.  There are a few signs of Audioslave's bright future, but this is just an average debut album that has been way overhyped.
6305308659|1.0|Okaydokay, this movie was just about exactly the worst movie I have ever seen, period. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! and I would have given it a -10 stars if the blasted review thingy had let me.<BR> <BR> Now on to my review. This movie started with a lot of potential, Tobey's performance was stupendous as usual, which may or may not have been a good thing. It's excellently scripted and wonderfully directed, but the story line! Okay, if we could all run around with no clothes, no rules, just following our emotions on impulse and having sex with whoever we feel like this world would be a better place-lets all be animals. This is never specifically stated (at least not in those terms), there is hardly anything, if anything graphic about this movie. It's all so well crafted your thought process is something like this \\"O, that looks like fun\\". <BR> <BR> Now I don't mean to imply that the director was trying to radically convert the world over to totally liberal ideas. He may just have had a bright idea for a clever story, one fine day, sat down and made it into this film. All the same if you are a human, and love being a human, and all the beauty that comes with being one, than don't watch this movie. <BR> <BR> In the very last scene the \\"mother\\" can't make up her mind who she'd rather be with, her husband or her lover, so they all sit on a bench and decide (now I don't remember the exact lines), but something is implied to the effect of \\"let's take it one day at a time, and we'll all pass her around and have fun\\". Yuck! Have they no respect for girls? It almost makes me ashamed to be one. O yah, and at some point (I don't remember which) the lover paints an \\"o so shocking\\" picture of his lady love on the front window of his shop (from life?). Anyhow this is done much to the consternation of other more \\"narrow minded\\" citizens. But our protagonist and his faithful follower bravely stand, grim faced, arms crossed on chest, the heroes of the age defending their masterpiece. Please, anyone? How can you like this movie? Just because now there are rainbows and bits of sunshine dancing on waterfalls with bright cheerful oranges doesn't mean that this way of living is what truely makes you happy. What a terrible way to live! Anyway, this is just the opinion of a modern day teen who loves living her life
0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill has significant structural problems. There are simply way too many loose ends at the end of the book. What happens to his Roak, his law clerk? What happens to the Clan? And What Happens to Jake Himself?  It is not hard to tell that this is a first novel. <br />I am giving this book 5 stars because although Grisham may not have the plot right, he has the feel right. This novel took him the longest to write, and it shows. Grisham wrote this novel while he was still practicing law, and it shows. Grisham knows northern Mississippi and does a brilliant job capturing the tension of a racially charged trial in a small southern town. In fact the best character in this book is by far the town of Clanton itself. In A Time to Kill Grisham is writing what he knows and it works beautifully.

B000058B2W|5.0|While Procol Harum's first four albums featuring Robin Trower get all the acclaim, I don't feel they really peaked until their 1973 album 'The Grand Hotel'. Their 1974 album, 'Exotic Birds & Fruit', vividly displays this maturity. Gary Brooker's vocals and the organ really soar in \\"As Strong as Sampson\\". This is not a one hit record though. It's full of a variety of great 'Procol' style music: \\"Nothing but the Truth\\" and \\"Beyond the Pale\\" are particularly good. Even though \\"The Idol\\" is repetitive I've grown to really like it. The remastering job is outstanding. The organ and vocals sound gorgeous. This is a fantastic album.
0316666343|4.0|Started this at 11pm in the midst of an exhausting week and didn't put it down 'til pg. 139.  Finished it the next evening.  While it is true that the book shifts gears about half way through and the character development was limited in some cases it was adequate to make her point.  Her stress was on the connections between both her live/dead selves, her family and her friends.  She stayed in character with the concerns, priorities and observations of a 14 - 24 yr. woman in the 70's-80's.  I appreciated the window and it rang true with my own perspective from those years.
B00003CXGG|4.0|out of the counteless martial arts wannabee movies, i think thta this 1 stood out to be in the catagory of karate flicks that people actually enjoy. altho flawed some, it was still a fairly decent movie. as always, the stunts are spectacular, but everything was fairly predictible, my advice is to rent it, and see where you will go with this movie from there
B00006IU73|5.0|I had actually gone into the music store looking for something else entirely - they didn't have it, so I picked up In Absentia instead (having heard of PT briefly in the late 90's), and I was blown away. The band's sound has become quite accessible, while retaining the complex, multi-leveled lyrics that had interested me in the first place.<br />Simply put: This is an awesome CD. Worth every last dollar. The video is pretty wicked too. ;)
B00007L4IA|1.0|Four Feathers 1939 is much better! This version didn't move me one bit!
B000003TAW|5.0|Many indie hipsters cringe when Weezer is mentioned. A bunch of geeky emo rockers that emulate the Pixies, right? What's so special about them?<br /><br />I know I'm not supposed to like them...and yet I can't keep the Blue Album out of rotation. Rivers Cuomo and the rest are so sincere, unpretentious and fun that they're irrestistible.  Weezer is a very capable band, turning out power pop hooks and catchy yet intelligent and introspective lyrics with ablomb.Weezer is NOT \\"emo.\\" Comparing them to teary-eyed junk like Dashboard Confessional and Bright Eyes does not do Weezer justice. They are alternative, though not in the Seattle vein. They sound a bit like the Pixies, but geekier and far, far less demented...oh forget it. Weezer is impossible to classify. The Blue Album is appealing and impossible not to love.<br /><br />I can't pick a favorite here. Every song is so good--everyone knows Buddy Holly and Say It Ain't So, but Undone (The Sweater Song), My Name Is Jonas, No One Else, Surf Wax America, In The Garage, and the stunning epic Only In Dreams are also worthy of a mention.<br /><br />In their first two albums (Blue Album and Pinkerton) Weezer hit their high water mark. The Green Album and Maladroit show a stale, less energetic band compared to the brilliance of the debut. This ranks as one of the finest recordings of the 90's. Get your copy now, and if you really get into it you might want to check out the cult classic Pinkerton.
B00006LLNU|4.0|Una sorpresa el descubrir un grupo como sigur rs, no habia escuchado nunca ni siquiera el nombre de la banda, pero fue una muy grata sorpresa. Puntualmente su musica es un verdadero trip por las nuves o por algo etereo, como que su musica flota en el ambiente, ya sea por su ritmica y su dinamica la cual se puede relacionar con la sicodelia de Pink Floyd o la ambientalidad de Brian Eno, pero estan demas las comparaciones ante una musica realmente original. <BR> El disco ( ) en si gira ante un tema comun,con una melodia y letra (pareciera estar en islandes) que se repite en cada una de las canciones, pero con un ambiente musical distinto. En cuanto a instrumentacion la bateria por lo general es muy remosada y lenta, solo en un par de partes explotan los platillos y se golpean fuerte las percuciones dando la sensacion de caos, las guitarras son el hilo conductor al igual que el teclado que juntos forman la masa sonora del disco. La voz es muy delicada por asi decirlo y como dije antes la letra y melodia vocal se repiten en varias partes del disco. <BR> Lo principal de Sigur Rs es el juego de sensaciones que te produce al escucharlo, algo que muy pocos grupos son capaces de manejar bien, sensaciones de calma y tambien de tristeza, por decir un par de muchos que puedes llegar a sentir, aunque en realidad los sentimientos  no se pueden describir a la perfeccion con palabras. <BR> Este es un disco que en verdad vale la pena, tanto por la belleza de la musica como por su originalidad.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Took the family to see this movie (may have been first mistake). Quite a bit of violence so you'll need to be prepared for that. Ben and Jen were excellent. The martial arts scenes were exceptional. Great special effects. The story was a bit weak. Asked the kids and they unanimously preferred Spiderman.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've always been a casual Johnny Cash fan and enjoyed his gunslinger and prison tunes for what they were- good country music.But recently I'd read a couple of reviews that suggested something more.So I looked for a recent album and was interested in \\"The Man Comes Around\\" for its covers of \\" I'm so lonesome I   could cry\\" and \\" desperado\\"What I didn't expect was his powerfull interpretations of songs of love, death and goodbyes<BR>by such current acts as Sting and Depeche Mode to be so incredably poignant. The voice is a little ragged at times but always full of the nuances of his life.An incredibaly suprising and moving collection of tunes.His own \\" When the man comes around\\" stands with the best.This is an honest and straightforward collection that lays waste to any preconceptions any casual listener may have.
B00005QZH2|4.0|A lot of musicians try to make a new and more modern form of tango but very few succeed, because they don't seem to catch the soul of tango. Gotan Project combines the strong sensuality with the rules of modern dance music. I believe a better combination is still possible but this CD is certainly worth listening to.<BR>Enjoy it!
B000088E6D|5.0|What an interesting album.  Thoroughly enjoyable with varied styles and textures all backed by a wonderful voice.  Excellent for cocktail parties or just listening.  Something both my parents and my daughter enjoys.
630460288X|4.0|John Spartin did not do the crime but he did do the time (30 years in a cryogenics facility to be exact).  All of that changes one day when the authorities in power the Police Department of San Angles lets him out. <BR>The only catch is that his arch nemesis <BR>(a certain psychopath named Simon Phoenix) has escaped from prison.  <br />How will Spartin survive in a world of (as  is so aptly termed in the movie) a bunch of robed sissies\\"  With expressions like \\"Murder Death Kill\\" and \\"Her lifeforce was terminated\\" and \\"Be Well\\".  This language really ticks me off.   <br />My impression-This what I consider to be the last good Sylvester Selone movie.  He has had a couple of decent ones since, but not many that can pull off the difficult task of being action packed and funny.  <BR>I also happen to love Dennis Leery.  Even though if I were being honest I'd have to say he stole a good deal of his material from the late-great Bill Hicks.  <br />Leary's performance along with Snipes provide some badly needed comic relief. Along with the action that makes this one of the better sci-fi movies of the 90s.
B00005JKZ3|5.0|This movie is more of a continuation of the first movie than a sequel. Agent J (Will Smith) finds he needs Agent K's (Tommy Lee Jones) expertise on a certain case. But if you seen the first MIB, than you know that K was deactivated and went back to live a &quot;normal&quot; life. The first part of the movie is spent tracking K down and reloading the MIB info into him.<br />One of the funniest scenes in the movie occur when J finds K running a small post office. You get to see the inside workings of the post office and it just made me laugh out loud.<br />Laura Flynn Boyle is the &quot;bad guy&quot; in this flick and she finds out something I've always suspected - you _could_ rule the world if you look like a &quot;Victoria's Secret&quot; model.<br />The extras on the dvd show how various creatures were made, deleted scenes and of course, various bloopers. This movie is not going to make you think harder about life but it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening. If you looking for great fun and you enjoyed the first &quot;Men in Black&quot;, this is an excellent choice for you. Watch and laugh - laughter is supposed to be the best medicine.
6305079811|5.0|What's a self respecting quarterback going to do when he is hijacked from an otherwise normal vacation by a crazy scientist that claims the moon is going to hit earth?  That's simple you don't believe him that is until you met Ming the Merciless for yourself and he tries to kill you.  Now what are going to do?  <br />My impression-Good music(courtesy of Queen) pretty good special effects that remain true to the sprit of the movies of the 30's.  In this I mean that they are a fun kind of cheesy in much the same way that the original star trek was a fu kind of cheesy.  Plus there is that great way the Voltan charecter has of saying \\"DIVE\\"!
B000003S0D|5.0|I agree with all the reviews about how unbelieveably good this album is.  All the earlier albums, up to Red, are wonderful.  But I noticed no one caught that the song &quot;Happy Family&quot; is about the Beatles.  Look at the drawing on the album cover and read the lyrics again.  If anyone else figured this out, I apologize for missing your mention of it.
B000002P86|4.0|Okay folks . . . take it from me. Buy this album. But please promise me to buy another couple of albums if you like this one, okay?<br />I don't care if you've new to the blues, have never before heard a BB King song before, or have never seen BB King in concert. This is perhaps the best introduction to the blues as you'll ever hear. From the Rolling Stones to Heavy D, there's something for everybody.<br />Typically the phrase &quot;something for everybody&quot; means lukewarm acceptance across a wide range of genres. I tried so hard to hate this album, but I just can't help loving it. Every artist here really sounds like they're pouring their best into the recording. <br />I defy you to tell me Bonnie's not leaning back and gritting her teeth when she plays slide guitar. Tell me that Heavy D wasn't breaking more than his usual room-temperature sweat when BB kicks the track back to him. My money's on Mick Jagger wishing he had some of Keith's alcohol-sodden blood running in his veins when the first few riffs of BB's guitar hits back harder than Mick expected. <br />Now that you've listened to it, go buy Blues on the Bayou. Then buy a Susan Tedeschi album. Grab some Little Milton too. Oh, and it wouldn't hurt at all to round it out with some Albert King, Ronnie Earl, and maybe some Johnny Lang or Kenny Wayne Shepherd if you're feeling spunky. But overall, shame on you if you don't have any John Lee Hooker!
B00005QZWI|5.0|All I can really say is, if you liked the music in the movie, then this cd is for you.  It is an exact replica of the music in the movie, even in order of the movie.  I think its great, especially the music from The Shire.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Just simply a fantastic movie with wonderful charater portrayals on everyones part.
B000050XEI|5.0|This cd is great, I love it, the first couple of times I listened to it, I thought is was &quot;good&quot;, then it just starts to grow on you.  Enya's voice is just so relaxing and peaceful.  I usually like to listen to it when I am taking a nice hot bubble bath.
B000089CJI|5.0|I'd be interested to hear what the other guy, i forget his name, from dntel did on this record seeing as he didn't sing and all the songs sound like ben gibbard songs. whatever, anyway, this is basically like electronic all time quarterback but much much better. the melodies are awesome. incredible. i love it. the only one i really don't like that much is clark gable, but i'm liking that one as i listen to the record more and more. either way, this should tide you over until the new death cab record comes out. it really is sufficient. the lyrics are obviously similar, thought-provoking and interesting and the lead/bgv's are top notch. however, this whole thing is electronic from top to bottom, so if that bothers you, you'll hate this, but that goes without saying. chances are if you like deatch cab, you're probably going to like this.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched this miniseries on HBO, and was completely taken with it, it could not have been any better.  So when it was released on DVD I snatched it up right away, being even more persuaded by the wonderful packaging of the dvd's.  Anyone who wants a great war miniseries must pick this up!  This is definetely (in my opinion) one of the best series on war, it is emotional, disturbing, moving, and simply enthralling to watch, you will want to watch episode after episode.  The acting is superb, the story is beyond belief with such moving scenes and a tad of humor to join it all.  You will be left with a feeling of complete satisfaction, and love for the series and the soldiers who went through this horrific time of war.
B000060P79|5.0|This is one of those classics that gets stuck in your head all day.   One of the best cds i have ever bought.  The music is catchy.  the album is a wonderful anthem for teenagers.  i would reccomend it to anyone who likes punk music.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this CD my bro introducted it to me I loved it ever since!
B000069AUI|5.0|There is not one dull, unexpressive song on this album.  They are all noteworthy and unique in their own right.  Green Eyes and Warning Sign are my current favorites, but that's just because they have a special meaning.  Politik is another strong track.  Excellent mood music, driving music.
B00000K3CR|5.0|The only reason I bought this film was to finally be able to see BIG in its original widescreen version (lately, this is the only way I like to see films now, except for those old films that were not filmed in Cinemascope).  Anyhow, the movie is wonderful and funny and very entertaining.  I forgot how GOOD Tom Hanks is in this movie which could have very well been a bomb.<BR>The DVD has nothing new to offer except for the original trailer and a few cast fimographies.  I would have liked an audio commentary by Penny Marshall (this being, after all, the first movie directed by a woman to gross 100 million at the box office), or at least a \\"making of\\" feauturette (The internet movie database says that Marshall filmed the adult sequences with a young Josh first so that Hanks could see how a child would ineteract in his place).<BR>Still, for the low price of this DVD, it is a bargain.
B00006RIO7|5.0|For those who loved the film the CD is essential. When you listen to the songs without the amazing visuals of the movie you realize just how great the music is and what an amazing job the cast does. I could do without the final two tracks but everything else is pure gold.
B0000027RL|4.0|Pearl Jam is my absolute favorite band in the world, and I own all seven studio albums, four live albums, and countless B-sides.  When looking over how the band has evolved and what music they put out after \\"Ten\\", I just simply can't call this their best album, even though it was their biggest seller (8.9 million to date in the US alone) and most beloved album.  I think that the fault lies in the fact that the band had not yet settled into a steady groove, and were just beginning to explore their musical boundaries.<br />Of course, this is still a great album, worthy of any casual rock fan's collection.  There is perhaps no better introduction to the fan's souring solos and Eddie Vedder's commanding prescence.  However, I believe that this is an album that is best heard live.<br />Once- An energetic opener, complete with the above formula.  PLEASE PLAY THIS SONG LOUD<br />Even Flow- OK, I know you'll all hate me for this, but I actually don't like this song much on this CD.  I think that the rythm section is especially weak.  This one has much more energy live<br />Alive- Pearl Jam's biggest radio hit, this one has a great solo, but listen to the lyrics- they're bizarre<br />Why Go?- Another fast and heavy song, a la \\"Once\\".  I love the chorus to this one<br />Black- The perfect song for all us hopeless romantics out there.  Vedder's very emotional, and there's a nice piano touch<br />Jeremy- The video that rocked the world- the song itself has a very surreal feel to it, especially when Vedder begins his wailing near the end<br />Oceans- Probably my least favorite song on the album.  It's slow, pleasant, and a bit catchy, but not up to the material that surrounds it<br />Porch- One of the album's best.  It's a great rocker, and has an awesome middle section where solos abound<br />Garden- Another strange song, a la \\"Jeremy\\".  However, it's very good, starting off slow and eventually building to a great ending<br />Deep- One of the album's heaviest songs, it tells astrange and interesting story of drug use.  I'd like to hear them play this one live more.<br />Release- The album's absolute best.  It's both sad and exhilirating, and is a great way to close off one of the decade's most important albums.
0060930187|5.0|Rarely, if ever do I give a book 5 stars, but this definitely deserved it. I was up until the wee hours in the morning reading this book. In this semi-autobigraphical account of Plath's own life, we follow Esther as she slowly sinks in the clutches of &quot;insanity&quot;. I especially liked the first person narration of the story; it provided a more personal view on Esther's fall into insanity. When I was reading it, I could feel and understand Esther's concerns with herself and the people/world around her.<br />I've noticed that most of the time when people talk about this book, they speak of only Esther's insanity and how it relates to Plath's own diminishing state of mind, but in my opnion, there's so much more to it than that. I actually think that in a small sense the story was also about the problems of the world through Esther's eyes. Take for instance Buddy's betrayal. This makes Esther question all those theories about men and women being pure for their husbands and wives. Yes, a large part of this story is about Esther's mental state, but at the same time, you're faced with a young woman who is aptly aware of her surroundings. She questions the standard? What's right? What's wrong?<br />This is definitely a book worth checking out and adding to your library.
0446608955|5.0|I thought this was a great book.  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  It taught me a life long lesson.  This book really relates to my life, not with Jamie having cancer but with seeing people for who they really are.  I would suggest this book for anyone.  From all the books I have ever read this would have to be my favorite.  I have also seen the movie and that is my favorite movie, but i believe the book is much better, more in depth, and more powerful.
1400034779|5.0|This is a charming story, with funny bits, a pleasure to read.  So good in fact, that I immediately bought the other volumes.  I hope the author writes as many books about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency as Agatha Christie wrote about her sleuths.  Not only are these good stories about interesting people, the information about Botswana is intriguing and makes me curious. I'd like to learn more.  Like another reviewer of this book, I have an additional recommendation to make.  If you really like mysteries and good writing, be sure to read Robert Barnard's books.  They are excellent.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Since this is the highest grossing movie in an opening weekend (and one of the most profitable flicks ever produced), I realize that trying to get you to watch it is already wasted effort.  Who hasn't seen this movie?  If you seriously haven't, you ought to, even if you're not a comic book fan.  It really is a coming of age story, despite all the special effects.  Peter Parker is awkward, bad with girls, and obsessed with someone who doesn't know he exists.  In other words, he's completely typical.  Feeding on teen angst and lack of self-confidence, nearly everyone can identify with Pete, so we're more than ready to cheer him on when he suddenly gets some super-powers thanks to a genetically altered spider.  The wild ride is definitely worth the price of admission, and the special effects are awesome (although some are pretty obviously fake).<br />Surprisingly, not much has been made of the way on-screen Spider-man differs from comic book Spider-man.  Granted, there's not a lot.  In the comic book he's bitten by a radioactive spider, and his webbing is his own creation and is delivered through little jets on his wrists.  In the movie his encounter with the spider gives him natural webbing.  Not a big deal.<br />The action in the movie is great, although this is a flick with flaws.  First off, Tobey McGuire is an AWESOME Peter Parker, and a ho-hum Spider-man.  He's got this mumbling quality that adds to the geeky persona, but translates really poorly for the wisecracking superhero.  Overall, though, he looks young enough to pull it off, and isn't too \\"heroic,\\" which is what Pete needs to be.  I can forgive the Spider-man stuff.  The second big glitch, in my opinion, is Kirsten Dunst.  She's a nice girl, but she just doesn't look the Mary Jane part.  This is where Jennifer Garner might have been better used (rather than as Electra in Daredevil).  Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress, but I just don't buy her in this role.  On the other hand, even though he looks nothing like Norman Osborn, Willem Dafoe is absolutely perfect as the Green Goblin (even though the costume looks very little like the comic book character).  Other casting is well done, though.  Ben and May Parker, Harry Osborn, Flash Thompson--these are great.<br />The DVD is definitely worth the investment.  The print is beautiful and it has enough easter eggs to keep you busy for hours.<br />No matter how good your home set-up is, you won't be able to replicate the cinema experience.  But, if you enjoyed the movie, this is definitely a \\"must have\\" DVD experience.  It's a lot of fun, and you enjoy the story again and again (or at least until \\"The Amazing Spider-man\\" in 2004).<br />Excelsior!s nothing like Norman Osborn, Willem Dafoe is absolutely perfect as the Green Goblin (even though the costume looks very little like the comic book character).

B00007CVSH|4.0|Il Trovatore is my favorite opera. To me, when Verdi composed Il Trovatore, he put the final touches on Bel Canto Operas; he splendidly used every Bel Canto \\"trick of the trade\\" putting his masterful \\"Verdian Stamp\\"on all. Since there was nothing left to be developed or written in the aforesaid style of opera, the way was paved for the further development of the Verismo-school of opera, and, utimately, for the Wagnerian epic leit-motive driven style of writing opera. Il Trovatore has everything, to me, that an opera should have--beautiful arias, ferocious cabalettas, thrilling, sing your lungs out, ensembles, loud-thundering-call-to-battle choruses, humable melodies, an improbable story, a love-struck-willing-to-die-for-her-man-soprano role, a brave-swashbuckling-lovable-not-too-smart-tenor role, a sexy-militaristic-kind-of-dangerous-love-starved-baritone role, and MOST OF ALL, a crazed-scene-chewing-I'm-really-really-your mama-so DO kill-the-baritone-for-me, mezzo-soprano role.<BR>Now days it is very difficult to vocally cast this opera. This new DVD has certainly assembled four singers that are up to their respective tasks; it is marvelous to hear and to watch. The singing is good and the action is believable--each singer looking and acting his/her part to the hilt (unlike the Met's video with Pavarotti sounding good but unable to move from one spot to the other). It's nice to hear the role of Manrico sung by a dramatic tenor again. I have great recordings with lyric Manrico(s) (i.e., Carreras, di Stefano, Algana) and I enjoy them; however, it's great to hear the full-throttled sound that Jose Cura can produce as Manrico. I know that there are opera critics that will, no doubt, rip his performnance apart comparing him to one of more dead tenors and perhaps to a few living ones. (The same thing that was done, in their day, to the recordings/ performances of Del Monaco and Correlli who sang full throttled virile Manrico(s). I don't care what the critics have to say;Jose Cura sings Manrico excitingly with gusto, tastefullness and also with plenty of tenderness, and at the same time, making Manrico as believable of a character, physically, as possible--he does not simply stand and deliver (as many a tenor has done as Manrico; just being glad to be able to get through it alive) but he does act and move about while singing some of the most beautiful music ever written for the tenor voice and singing it very well. (Be advised, he is not a tenor that holds on to the high notes for as long as possible popping blood vessels and running out of breath with arms out-stretched waiting for the audience to start applauding, but he sings them very musicially making them, as I feel they should be, a part of the muscial line not the main event).<BR>I have always felt that Dmitri Hvorostovsky was born to sing Count di Luna with his beautiful, smooth, as butter, baritone voice. He brings everything that should be brought to the role--beautiful tone (throughout all registers) accurate singing, power and flexibility. Bravo!<BR>Naef takes-on the mezzo role of the crazed Azucena, and, to me, she is up there with some of the great performers of the part--Bumbry, Cossoto, Simonato, Varrett and Zajick (Zajick being the best thing on the Met Video.)<BR>In my \\"dream-cast\\" DVD of this opera, the role of Leonora would be taken by a soprano that has some of the qualities that Leontyne Price had (Aprile Millo comes to mind) Since, alas, the likes of Leontyne Price will never be seen again (thankfully Leontyne happened in my lifetime) Vilarroel, as Leonora is certainly an adequaate compromise--no trills (neither did Tabaldi) or floating of the tones or well-supported ravishing pianissimos; neverthless, very committed and enough voice to do Verdi's music justice! She is far superior to Eva Marton's \\"Brunnhilde Version\\"--what the hell am I doing in Il Trovatore--ain't this Gotterdammerung?--of Leonora in the Met's video.<BR>The production is enjoyable, watchable and believable being neither a stodgy traditional production nor one of those extreme avant-garde productions set in the year 2090 where every movement and object has a completely unintelligible hidden meaning.<BR>If you love Verdi (as I do) buy this DVD for a full throttled performance of Il Trovatore. (The DVD has some very nice added features too!)
0380789035|3.0|The book gets off to a good start introducing a very cool idea and some pretty cool characters.  The problem is that for the bulk of the book nothing much happens to them. There is little character development and the plot drags on at an awful pace. I found my self liking this book in theory but not in actuality.  Read it if you want to but be prepared not to like it as much as you want to.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I warn you that this movie is not for everyone.  It's the type of movie where if you get it, you love it but if you don't get it, it will be extremely boring.  I love the whole movie as it is witty and funny as well as deep and meaningful.  My advice is to watch the DVD as the extra scenes create a fuller, more complete movie.  I wish they had made an extended version DVD  with the extra scenes in it.  What I find the best in this movie is the ending.  It isn't hollywood but its not right out of left field either.  One of the smartest endings I've ever seen.  The whole movie is excellent and suggest that everyone gives it a go. It takes a few viewings to get the whole thing but well worth it.
6302886228|5.0|We have to have this in DVD format... Notify me when it is out.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I thought that the viewpoint from which it was told was very interesting.  It shows a side of the story that most would not think of.  My only disappointment (without giving too much away) was her reincarnation on earth for a short time.  I thought that hurt the story, but the rest of it makes up for that part.  I have already started &quot;Lucky&quot; by Alice Sebold and am loving that just as much.
B0000640VO|5.0|I love this film so much that just the music is enough to make me smile.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I purchased this album shortly after I heard the song, \\"No One Knows\\" on the radio. I looked at the song and heard something that I didn't hear from a lot of the things on the radio: individuality. These guys were making something that sounds nothing like the rest of the disturbingly lame Alternative nation right now. The sound they display is resemblent of old school classic rock favorites and the lyrical content doesn't consist of \\"I'm one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break\\" or \\"I f*ckin hate you\\" I'm sorry, but the a group of up-start 10th graders with hopes of becoming stars could write lyrics like that.<BR>Queens of the Stone Age's album, \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is definitely in my top 20 albums of all time that I have listened to. \\"First it giveth\\" and \\"Mosquito Song\\" are both amazing songs that left me shaking my head. I can't wait to see these guys perform at Lollapalooza this summer with the likes of Audioslave (great band) and Incubus (great old stuff, softer new). <BR>I've got musical views from all over, I listen to rock (A.I.C being my favorite) to underground rap and a little prog rock. These guys have opened my eyes to \\"stoner rock\\". I'll be purchasing more albums from these guys in the near future and I'd recommend this album to anyone with a good musical taste for creativity and some good riffs.
B000001FRY|4.0|Well, as the title suggests, my opinion of U2 today is pretty low. I think their newest album was complete...compared to their early stuff, I am also new to U2, they released 4 albums before I was even born...but their early stuff, as far as I have heard, is great, and is a big influence to what I have been listening to for years. Bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, Cursive, Fugazi, Hot Water Music, At The Drive-In, Sparta, and MILLIONS of others defiently grew up listening to U2 and many bands of the time. The era of punk also has a big role in all their music. If you listen to any sort of underground rock today, buy this album...or download it... You will be pretty surprised at how good this record is, and how influencial it was. It changed music as we know it.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I purchased this film in advance when I saw the preview on Kino's website.  It just came today, and I watched this version for the first time.  This is the film which made me fall in love with silent films.  My mother had an atrocious copy put out most likely by &quot;Goodtimes&quot; on vhs.  I saw it the first time in 1988, and it has enthralled me ever since.<br />The premise is basic; in the future, mankind is downtrodden by the brutal masters of industry.  Freder is the son of one such master, Joh Frederson, the master of Metropolis.  The sons of these masters are kept seperate from the workers, so they never see the devestation wrought by their fathers.  Freder, Joh's son, falls in love with a worker's daughter, Maria, who is a motivational speaker in secret meetings for the workers.  Freder, in his pursuit, discovers the brutal conditions the workers are subjected to, and sets against his father.  Joh goes to Rotwang, a mad scientist who creates a robot to look like Maria to foment revolution to help control the workers.<br />The story is actually very well done, but prior to this version nothing has been available at an adequate quality.  With this painstakingly preserved version, this beautiful film is seen once more as it was meant to be, or as close as possible given the available footage.  The restored film looks great, allowing a better print than many films half its age.  The restored music score is dazzling, and the production stills, 43 minute documentary, and many other relevant features are worth the admission fee.  If you like Sci Fi and/or silent films, this film is not only great, but necessary.
B00006IUOZ|4.0|The story had me until all the chasing and hiding came into play.  There is not enough about how insomnia affects the brain.   We see Al Pacino running around trying to catch the killer, but not enough depth into what compels him to do it.  Al Pacino and Robin Williams are superb.  If you like this combination you will enjoy the movie.
067144901X|5.0|This book is my son's (2 1/2) absolute favorite and has been since before he turned one. He can recite almost the entire thing by heart, as a result of the number of times we have read it together. I buy this book as a gift always. It is fabulous, as are most of the Sandra Boynton books.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|It has been said that the Man in Black is coming to an end, in career and in life.  All I have to say is that if this is true, what an ending.  Johnny Cash has been a predominant name in music for about fifty years now, and has done things throughout his career that any musician would want to do.  He not only has had a longevity that rivals just about every great out there, but he has also consistently kept his audience on their toes.  This album is no exception.  The Man Comes Around is the forth installment of the American Recordings series, as well as the fourth time collaborating with producer Rick Rubin, and it seems to be paying off.  <br />Aside from the four Grammy nominations that the duo has recently received, this album seems to be beautifully fitting for the 70 plus year old Man in Black.  The Man Comes Around is sewn together by magnificently sung classics and wonderfully somber moments that are thoroughly complemented by the voice of the brilliant, but fading Cash.  The first single off the album is a cover of the Nine Inch Nails song \\"Hurt.\\"  Cash brings a whole new perspective this song.  Lyrics written from a youthful angst of Trent Reznor are given a new meaning in this beautiful, but depressing version.  I think that the song and the album are quite fitting, and if this is to be the last we hear from the infamous Johnny Cash, then it will be known that his departure was perfectly impressive, only to be topped by his longevity and his talent.
B00000JGOH|5.0|I really cannot understand why this magnificent movie draws such horrific comments from some people. It just strenghtens my opinion that the cultural level in the western world it's too low nowadays... <BR>As for me, this movie is MY NUMBER ONE MOVIE OF ALL TIMES, but this is only a my subjective point of view.Anyway , I'm not exactly a newcomer in this art, viewing that I'm studying movie directing at the Media University in Bucharest.<BR> Back to the movie, it is really difficult to begin with something, so numerous are the qualities of this movie. <BR>It is simply THE GREATEST SCREENPLAY of all times, with countless gems, witty lines, twists (it is NOT PREDICTABLE OF ALL!), a really luminous down ending(which is a very rare thing). EVERYBODY, BUT I MEAN EVERYBODY, has something \\"to eat\\" in this movie!...No character is here by chance, from the kid John Webster to Will Shakespeare, the appearance of every character has some meaning. And the development of the plot, reallly of Shakespearean quality, is interweaved magnificently with Romeo and Juliet, the play wich we rediscover in this movie('cause too often we think we've seen all and we know everything about Shakespeare's plays but really we DON'T). It takes a genius of the dimensions of Tom Stoppard(let's not forget Marc Norman) to make this kind of devilishly clever script...<BR> The Academy made, in that year, maybe one of it's smartest choices(alongside of the year when they gave the Oscar to Ordinary people). \\"Saving private Ryan\\" seemed to have  the upper hand. It was very \\"american\\", with a patriotic message, spectacularly directed, and it was representing a very ambitious to win Steven Spielberg(probably  the most powerful man in film industry right now). But no, the Academy voters were not stupid. They KNEW, they understood very well that Ryan had virtually no plot(or at least it looked like a heavy handed, mechanical , predictable plot, with a cheesy patriotic ending). <BR>   On the other hand , Shakespeare in love had all the odds against it. Released in december, it was representing nobody(except for Bob Weistein, the Miramax boss). John Madden was a nobody, Tom Stoppard was not very well known in America, Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow were not very known and beloved in America(compared to Tom Hanks), it was a British period piece...Some would have said \\"Come on, you really expect this to win over Saving private Ryan?!\\" But it did...Deservedly...       Shakespeare in love has definitely the greatest original score of all times. I really cannot praise enough how great the music composed by Stephen Warbeck for this movie is...<BR>The last twenty minutes in the movie are really one of the greatest moments of cinemamaking in history, and the final shot is THE GREATEST SINGLE FINAL SHOT OF ALL TIMES...<BR> So, don't listen to the opinions of some uneducated guy, listen to somebody that KNOWS. Go and rent this movie, have a little patience at the beginning, 'cause after that, you will want to see it over and over again...
B000084T18|5.0|If you don't have a copy of 50 Cent's \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" already, good luck getting one. I got the last copy from Sam Goody on Valentines Day and it's hot hot hot!  He hooked me with \\"In Da Club\\", I swear every time I heard it I wanted to go out and party.  Eminem and Dr. Dre certainly know good talent - 50's new CD definitely doesn't disappoint -even though \\"In Da Club\\" is a hard act to follow, tracks like, What Up Gangsta, Heat and Back Down - make you wonder how he does it.  I'm telling you,50's got me crazy for more, can't wait to see him in concert or at Da Club!  His lyrics are hardcore yet catchy and the beats are examples of creative genius -  The CD is a must for the collection. 50 Cent is living up to his name - he's changing the game- taking rap to the next level!  Go boy!
B0000019HU|5.0|Slint's album from 1991 sounds light years ahead of its time, even now in 2003.  The raw energy and emotion achieved on this record is the pure definition of dynamic quality.  The drummer is simply the most talented percussion artist I've ever heard, and the endlessly evolving guitar riffs are truly awe-inspiring.  This is particularly evident on track #2 - \\"Nosferatu Man\\" and track #6 - \\"Good Morning, Captain\\", where the sound environment created is beyond the restraints of our physical reality as we know it.  Head-banging rock music combined with though-provocation.  Thank you gentlemen.  Thank you very much. <br />I am almost tempted to take away a star, and it's for a reason that is all too common in the indie-rock genre.  The lyrics to this album are nearly unintelligible (I had to go to the internet, as usual).  Believe me, you NEED to hear Slint's lyrics, because they truly have a message.  Unfortunately, the message is all but lost to all but the most astute listener.  Please, and this message goes out to all indie-rock bands.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TURN UP THE VOLUME LEVEL ON YOUR VOCALS IN THE STUDIO !!!  I can name you at least seven indie-rock bands that could of/can vastly improve on their already impressive overall quality by simply doing this in the studio (i.e. - The Promise Ring, Built to Spill, My Bloody Valentine, Red Stars Theory, Hum, Sunny Day Real Estate, Slint, etc, etc.)  <br />I fully understand that the following statement makes me sound like a fool, but I'm going to make it anyway:  \\"Spiderland\\" is a more emotional, more intense, more talented, overall stronger album than Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\".  There, I finally got it off my chest.  Nirvana, leave no doubt, certainly has had more influence on rock music in the last 20 years than any other band.  HOWEVER, Nirvana did not \\"save\\" rock music with their \\"grunge-sound\\".  In fact, their influence stemmed from the fact that they prevented the tremendous indie-rock / post-punk evolution of the late 80's - early 90's from gaining the popularity that it might have otherwise received (i.e. - Slint, Pavement, The Pixies, Jawbreaker, Fugazi, Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr., etc.).  In my opinion, this is a GOOD THING !!<br />Long live the \\"unknown\\" indie-rock band !!!  <BR>Long live Slint !!!
B00007E8V4|3.0|Stuff that wasn't good enough for Toxicity was thrown on this album and people accepted it as effort. The only reason SOAD did this was to keep their band and their music in the public's eye and earholes. The longer you stay away, the easier it is to forget you completely. C'mon people, who are you kidding?? the only song on this cd that is even halfway decent is \\"Innervision\\", the rest of this cd is ... and should be sold to a middle schooler who doesnt know not to listen to corporate sellouts.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have read the book and seen the movie.  This set of DVD's provides the truest, most excellent portrayal of the camaraderie developed by military personnel, and also the horrors experienced in combat.  I come from a military family, with my grandfather having served in WWII and Korea, my father having served in 'Nam, and I have served in the USMC.  I grew up watching war films and shows such as Gomer Pyle, Baa Baa Black Sheep, etc.  If those \\"feel good\\" type of shows are what you consider to be \\"heavy\\" military viewing, showing a realistic portrayal of combat, then this movie will definately open your eyes to the actuallity.  Imagine Saving Private Ryan's opening sequence, for the entire movie.  Excellent commentary from the men that were there and experienced the horrors first hand.  This series should be required viewing of all high school US History classes.
B000069CWE|5.0|First thing to say: If you don't like hip-hop mixed with rock and then sliced and diced by *many* talented DJ's and artists, this may not be for you. I say 'may not' becuase at first I was a bit apprehensive.<br />I am no longer.<br />This album is quite literally a reanimation of Linkin Park's previous album, with non-US releases 'High Voltage' and 'My December' remixed and redone as well. In this case, reanimation does not mean re-hashing. It means re-doing the entire kit from start to finish. Most every song has a completely different feel, yet still maintain the lyrical and musical genius of the group. They are not some simple rock/rap group - they are more than that. With lyrics that come from that indefinable place within and coming out with the heavy weight of emotion upon them, gives the album an incredible depth - And you can't forget the excellent artists who collaborated on the album to make such amazing music even better.<br />Right now I have the track 'P5ing Me A*wy' (Pushing Me Away) playing. I have goosebumps. It's *that* good.<br />But to really enjoy it, don't think about the album 'Hybrid Theory' where most songs have their roots. Doing so will only detract from the experience.<br />Listen to this cd for what it is: a truly amazing musical ensemble with depth and vision beyond many others.
B00005YUPO|4.0|I bought the whole Baby Einstein set, (10 so far) for my daughter when she was 2 months old.  So far this one is by far her favorite of the ones for 18 months and under.  She laughs and talks to it, she especially likes the children's appearances.  I'd recommend it, especially if you can find the set, it's way cheaper than buying them individually.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne's debut cd was actually really good. Unlike most of the singers her age, she has a different edge. Instead of relying on her looks and intricate choreagraphy, she actually sings well. She reminds me of another Canadian, Alanis Morrissette. Most of the negative reviews state that she isn't punk enough...but does it matter?--At least the focus of her music is her music and not some lame dance steps. Other reviews stated that her music isn't deep enough, but I think those people are confusing lack of substance with her way of stating things plainly. Anyway, how many profound life experiences do you expect and eighteen year-old to write about? My favorite song on the cd would have to be track 6, \\"Unwanted\\"; track 11 is also quite good for its message, and she raps a little, which is quite funny. I would defintely recommend her cd to anyone, especially if the person enjoys her previous three singles that have aired on the radio.
B00005JM1D|5.0|This movie is hilarious!  Not a minute went by during this movie that I did not laugh at least once, and I was still laughing when I left the theater.  The cast is perfect.  They managed to get all my favorite men into one movie.  Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell fit their roles well.  Luke Wilson plays the straight-arrow as usual.  Vince Vaughn plays an unhappy-but-dedicated family man.  Will Ferrell plays the newlywed who tries to commit to his wife, but let's his partying get the better of him.  There's even a small role for Craig Kilborn of CBS' The Late Late Show.  (He plays the philandering boyfriend of the woman with whom Luke Wilson's character is in love.)  A word of advice: Don't go to this movie expecting a realistic plot or a sappy Cinderella love story.  Go to this movie expecting to laugh.
B000084T18|5.0|It's addictive!!!!!!  Haven't stopped listening to this cd since I've bought it!!!
B00000JPH5|5.0|I loved this movie, it was just everywhere, it kept you in suspense and of course David Bowie in tights haha.
0399226907|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Eric Carle it a great artist and storywriter.  I suggest collecting his books.  The colors and shapes jump out at you.
B00006BIO0|4.0|For anyone who wants Patton's complete recorded works, but who doesn't want to spend half a paycheck on the Revenant Box Set, this 5 disc JSP collection is an unbelievable value.  I was flabbergasted when I discovered it online the other day; I couldn't believe it was so cheap.  It contains everything on the Revenant set except the interviews and the bonus disc of music by Patton's contemporaries.  It does, however, contain Son House's overpowering 1930 recordings (everytime I listen to them my stomach drops).  What else is there to say?  This is glorious, intense, and important music.  <br />The remastering is very good, but not without its drawbacks.  I love JSP's Django Reinhardt and Louis Armstrong remasterings.  The Patton recordings here have the same full, glowing sound (with more hiss and crackle, of course, because of the atrocious quality of the original Paramount 78s).  Patton's voice is remarkably intense; one can gain a sense of what a powerful instrument it must have been live.  Turn up the volume, and it will hit you in your gut.   You can literally feel his throat's rough vibrations, his subtle bending of pitch.  The slide guitar pieces (\\"Oh Death\\" and \\"Spoonful,\\" for example) come through quite well.  They are deep and resonant.<br />At the same time, as with every remastering of old 78s, something is lost in the transfer.  These remasterings seem vacuum-packed, as if all the all the air in the room had been sucked out.  Patton's voice is brought forward, but as a result, some of his guitar work seems muffled.  It is as if the remastering aimed to simulate a modern recording studio, allowing only sound from the the guitar and voice to come through.  This eliminates one of the best aspects of 78s: their open, echoing sound.  (This problem, however, is not nearly as bad as on the Catfish reissue.)<br />Compare this with the Yazoo reissues (my favorites).  There is more surface noise on the Yazoo albums, but this also allows more room for the sound tobreathe.  One can hear the full range of the sound.  There is also a more vivid, lifelike tone on the Yazoo Patton, even if he seems a little distant at times.  It is easier hear the wistful echoes that Patton built into his work.  By contrast, the JSP recordings are much more intense; Patton's growl is right at the surface.  In short, the intensity of Patton's voice on JSP is a revelation, but the set does not convey the full, sparkling range of sound found on Yazoo.
0743506650|5.0|To abide by Mr. King's advice, I'll cut out the unnecessary bull....  I have never read a Stephen King fiction novel, but I read this fantastic book.  If you like to laugh, this is for you.  If you like to learn, this is for you.  If you'd like insight into one of the most profitable writers of all time, this is for you.  Told straightforward and honest.  Motivating and sobering.
B000089CPF|4.0|Please don't let other reviews here confuse you.  This is NOT a pop record and while a few of the songs may stray somewhat into that territory this is first and foremost a CALEXICO record.  Feast of Wire is an eclectic mix of many ethnic and musical influences from all over the map, all kept in check by front men Joey Burns and John Convertino.  To compare this recording to Wilco's &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is doing it a great disservice.  And Calexico doesn't need critical praise heaped upon them (although it is due) nor do they need a nifty band vs. label war story to create interest and boost sales (see Wilco).  Joey and John know full well what they are doing and they let the music do the talking.  It also doesn't hurt that they have room to roam on their excellent independent Quarter Stick label.  Keeping that in mind, the songs &quot;Not even Stevie Nicks...&quot; (a Neil Youngish folk beauty) and &quot;Quattro (World Drifts In)&quot; are about as pop as this record gets.  Where the band really shines is on the more complex tracks such as the wonderful Mexican sounding &quot;Guero Canelo&quot; and the cool jazz inspired &quot;Crumble&quot;.  With a great mixture of both vocal and instrumental tracks arranged with the hand of fine craftsmen Burns and Convertino have managed to refine their craft and create their most accessible work to date. And they do all this without wandering into the experimental or self-indulgent wasteland which has sparked the demise of many bands.  Thanks to Calexico, Americana is alive and well.
B000002UVX|5.0|Ah, the Fillmore East--think of all the great albums taped there, by Miles Davis, the Allman Brothers, Frank Zappa, what a venue. Maybe it's the place, but whatever it is, good stuff comes out of it--and this is among the best.<br />What a joy, this album. Not all the songs are great (I really don't care much for the two Buddy Miles tunes--but Hendrix uses them to his advantage), but the guitarplaying is awesome, Hendrix at his best. Bluesy and rocking, cranking out the trademark riffs and screams, schooling everyone in how to use the wah, he plays all these tunes with incredible confidence. I have no doubt Hendrix practiced until his fingers bled, but it's amazing how natural it all sounds--he never seems in doubt about where to go even when he's jamming, like he was born with it. Maybe he was. Especially the version of &quot;Machine Gun&quot; is fantastic; he seems so at one with his guitar (only SRV ever came close to this, in my opinion), jamming away and picking up the theme whenever he likes, playing and singing in unisono--sticking to the song seems like an afterthought, but he never loses sight of it.<br />When Zappa sang &quot;Jimi come back,&quot; it was more than satire--I'm sure he meant it. If only Hendrix could have made that studio date with Miles Davis...but at least I have the funky, bluesy, jazzy, genre-bending Band of Gypsys here to make up for it a bit.
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream&quot; John Lennon once sang, quoting from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. &quot;Tommorow Never Knows&quot;, the song from whence this phrase came, is quite similar sonically to &quot;Kid A&quot;. Not only are Radiohead the most innovative and experimental pop-rock band since the mid-sixties Beatles, they may be the most potent antidote to rap music in a society hijacked by the hip hop culture. Up until now, what rock and roll artist has had anything remotely new to say creatively that didnt involve two turntables and a microphone? This album is absolutely like nothing else you have ever heard or will likely hear ever again. It certaintly is light years ahead of OK Computer, an album that was far and away an improvement over &quot;The Bends&quot;. If nothing else, it proves that rock and roll has been taken off of life support and is feeling quite better, thank you.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|You forget how good Johnny Cash is if you haven't listened to him in a while. I'm not talking about Live at Folsom Prison or something like that, I mean his new stuff. Seventy years old and he still cranks out album after album of amazing material. I was a little nervous when I heard that American IV was covers -- established artists often pull a Titanic when they cover other people's songs (U2, I'm talking to you) -- but Cash pulls it off flawlessly. Standouts include The Man Comes Around, Hurt (Trent Reznor), Personal Jesus (Depeche Mode! He makes Depeche Mode sound good!), We'll Meet Again, and ... well, everything. Don't complain that there isn't any good music anymore...as long as Cash puts out albums you have something to buy.
B00005JKCH|5.0|The number 1 movie of all time.....Spider-Man!!!... I love this movie in theatres and I decided to check out the DVD.  <br />This movie is really good and that doesn't change...the special features are cool because you can mess with the 3d effects....well not during the movie...but parts of it.  <br />I recommend this one to anyone who liked the movie when they saw it in theatres and I also recommend it to someone who hasn't seen it....you won't be dissapointed.  Peace!!!
6304211740|1.0|Someone called it a \\"shockingly beautiful\\" movie. Yes, shocking sounds about right, though I would not call it beautiful. I am sorry, I just can't help it. This movie effectively mangled my favorite childhood novel. First of all, the casting. Charlotte Gainsbourg does a passable Jane Eyre, but a BLOND ROCHESTER?!.... I think that it would help a lot if whoever were casting an adaptation of such a well-known (and well-loved) book would actually READ the novel...<br />Another thing that I could not abide--they removed all the romantic/gothic scenes from the movie. \\"Stripped of the romanticism\\", you call it? I would say, rather, that they took out the most interesting scenes in the novel, including the wonderful Rochester-dress-up-as-a-gypsy scene, where you first begin to believe he loves Jane and not Blanche. And what about the dread that the woman in the attic inspires *before* she appears? For instance, they dispensed with the scene when Bertha walks into Jane's bedroom at night and rips her veil. Gosh, I remember the feeling of impending doom and gloom these chapters inspired--when Rochester is telling Jane that it's only a dream, and you begin to believe him, and hope he's right--until she holds up her torn veil! How could they simply cut them out? Jane Eyre, for all its social significance, is a GOTHIC novel, and such scenes are absolutely important! Without these scenes, it is just another governess story--it certainly is not the Jane Eyre I remember... I say again, ugghhh. Not good...
0375414053|4.0|I roared with laughter and cringed at the dead on assessments in the very first chapters.  A wonderful, brutally honest, *funny* view of working mothers. I immediately bought and lent copies to my casual network of working mother friends, saying \\"Read this, it's about us!\\"  Readers not familiar with British slang will struggle a bit, but it's still worthwhile.  My only complaint, and a very small one, is: why does the resolution depend on Kate rescuing everyone else in her life: her father, her slandered co-worker, her mother, her sister, her sister's co-workers, probably the whole darn economy by the time she's through?  Does getting out of the working mother trap require performing great acts for the social good?  Isn't that what got us into the mess in the first place? But I rant, and I digress.  Read it, and enjoy it as comedy, social commentary or both. Here's hoping Kate Reddy pulls it off!
B00006SFLV|4.0|I love my so called life but the audio quality of this dvd set makes it slightly disappointing. Music sounds very distorted and voices bounce back and forth between distorted and not. I thought with this being a very wanted set the the company that released the set would make sure that the technical quality of the dvd's would be as wonderful as the show it's self. I also wish that there were some sort of extras.     Aside from the technical aspects, I absoulutly adore this set. This is my all time favorite tv show and I wish they continued it into another season. It captures highschool life perfectly. I was Anglea Chase, the way they protrayed her life was exactly how I felt at that time. Even watching it now, after I've been out of high school, I can still relate to the characters. This show is the prefect portrayal of highschool life that many people can relate to. I can't stop wacthing it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD.  I saw Norah on late-night TV and was blown away.  I absolutely love her style - then add Bill Frisell to the mix and I'm in heaven!  I've never before heard someone so young with such a mature, bluesy style.  I can't wait for her next release.
B00005JL3A|3.0|The movie is ok....that's it.....just ok!!!  It has some scary moments but as a fan of the game....I thought the game was scarier than the movie!! ....
B000002C1V|5.0|The Final Cut to me is one of the great social commentaries of the 20th century. It's a harsh, sarcastic and utterly depressive look at the world and its tendency to wage war. Together with masterful lyrics by Waters, beautiful guitar solo's by Guilmore and that 'sound' that only Pink Floyd can create, its message is carried over with unbelievable emotional clarity.<br />I should however mention that this album HAS TO BE listened in one go, from start to finish, and that it might take a few listens to really appreciate. It's a very draining listen and culminates to a point of despair words can't describe. Don't buy if you have suicidal tendencies!
B00007LL7O|5.0|I GIVE IFIV STARS FOR THE LYRICS WHICH ARE AMAIAZING AND I LOV TEH SINGING AND TEH TRUE POEWR METALE<br />STARTOVIARUS FOR LIFE
B0000542D2|3.0|But this film left me cold. What was cutting edge in the 60s seems so naive now. I can see the joy and wonder experienced by the Beatles, but the film is unsatisfying as I simply failed to become engaged in the plot or the [real life] characters. I'm sure anything less than a 5 star review will be voted down by other reviewers (am I off the island), but I just don't get this. And I do like the Beatles.
0066214122|5.0|This was a fantastic novel!  It follows a structure very similar to &quot;Sphere&quot; (with characters you care just as much for) while focusing on a much more realistic scientific possibility.  As a graduate computer science student, I appreciated the accuracy of Crichton's details when describing distributed intelligence.  This book presents us with a haunting (and somehow inevitable) future.
B00005JKEC|5.0|I don't recommend this VHS version to buy.....get it on DVD but hey you got to get what you gotta get... This was a good movie and the plot is very on point.<br />Denzel won a Oscar for this movie and I think he should of considering the talent and the character building that he did for this movie. This is a movie to have in the collection and watch it every 2 months are something. ....
B000002HEP|5.0|After hearing Queens of The Stone Age this past fall, and hearing the Tool cover of &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot;, I figured I'd give Kyuss a try and see how they were. The whole Cd amazed me. The rhythmic drum beats, the distorted guitar, and the standout vocals just came together into one great experience. Part I (tracks 1-3) shows you three different styles of what this band is capable of. Part II (4-6) starts off heavy and pounding with &quot;100 Degrees&quot;, but then switches it up into &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, and finishes it off with my personal favorite, &quot;Demon Cleaner&quot;. Part III finishes off the Cd strong, especially with &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;N.O.&quot;. And &quot;Whitewhiter&quot; is a quite humorous, yet perfect way to end a perfect Cd. 10 out of 10. Five stars. If you're looking for something different, then this is your dream Cd. This Cd is definetly a must-buy.
B00005JLXC|4.0|I must say that upon entering the theater, I was expecting a great show, one that could rival last spring's amazing Spiderman. The previews had certainly led me to believe such a thing, not that I was totally dissapointed when I left. There were some great aspects to it, and I, being attracted to movies with lots of romance coupled with great action sequences, did get what I had hoped for. The only difference was that the happy ending (or that which would be reflective of later happiness) was not at all what I was left with. ...The movie itself was also rather dark. It was made to be that way for a reason as the ending explains, but it is not to be recommended to those who wish to experience the uppity atmosphere that Spiderman held. Overall, it was a good movie but I was mortified at how they finished it off. For the last 20 minutes or so of the film, I admit I was hoping that the deceased person would somehow rise from the dead, and those thoughts prevented me from fully appreciating (or paying attention) to the finale. My impressions of Daredevil are as I have just previously explained and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fun action sequences and lots of romance.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is one of my top 10 favorite films of any kind. It's got a poetic, epic quality and the performances are amazing. Some viewers will find it too long, and the action comes in relatively short bursts. I'd compare Unforgiven to Kurosawa in its scope.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Walt Disney's first feature length animated film is just as much of a classic today as it was when it first premiered in 1937. The story of the beautiful princess taken in by seven kindly dwarfs in order to protect her from her evil stepmother, the Queen, is a magical adventure that unfolds almost as if it is a fairytale book that has come to life (which, in a way, it is). The memorable characters and songs are sure to make this a favorite of every member of the family. The DVD complements the enchanting film with a virtual journey into Snow White's World guided by the magic mirror which is found on disk two. This includes interactive environments, galleries of artwork, and extras such as deleted scenes, rejected concepts, and vintage audio and films which any Disney fan or film historian will find fascinating. All in all, a wonderful addition to any DVD collection.
B00000AFHM|1.0|Someone gave me this disc and the result was a lot of lost time and productivity in my life. <br />Seriously - This album doesn't make any impression either musicaly or lyrically. It is totaly forgetable and leads you to complete nothingness. Its like eating the main course only to find yourself still hungry, ordering another meal to eventually find yourself broke and starving. Its as harmless as raindrops in a puddle and there is no beauty or melancholy here  - rather a complete and utter experience of blandness.<br />Perhaps the ultra-fragile types on the verge of a physical and mental breakdown might find temporary sedation in this and no doubt intellectuals and critics worldwide will praise it.
B000002NIW|5.0|Deftones/ Around the Fur<br /> Around the Fur, can it actually be called an album or rather just a collection of amazingly simple intriguing songs? Packaged in plastic shrink-wrap, once open The Deftones hit you like a speeding bullet and then pretend to perform open-heart surgery on you. Imagine the warm blankets that keep you from becoming paralyzed; holding you like an innocent baby, then without sudden notice it all abruptly vanishes. Take the very same emotion, discontentment, and innocence, and you've found yourself admits the music of Deftones; you are paralyzed. <BR> There are like every cd the songs that will stand for the band and the songs that aren't quite as amazing. In this case 'My Own Summer,' 'Around the Fur,' 'Mascara,' 'Be Quiet and Drive,' and 'Dia the Flue' are the songs that that stand out. And like every band The Deftones have there up and down points. They tend to repeat themselves, and say the same thing. This is common among many bands, but the difference with The Deftones is the way in which they can change. The first album 'Adrenaline' had plenty of storm, but lacked the calm that made you realize just how intense the storm was. Around the Fur is a mile stone marker for The Deftones and modern music, but it is not an album. The songs speak to you in a fashion often spoken but never truthfully. It is one of the greatest cds of the 90's, but sadly few can tap into its immense wealth of abstract poetry and dynamic hooks that send you off soaring into the clouds.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD!  Howard Shore sure knows how to write specific music for a specific character/scene.  I think I like &quot;The Two Towers&quot; music even better, but FOTR is a great start for the series.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|THIS CD ROCKS, BRUCE IS THE MAN, \\"OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET\\" IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPRESSIVE SONGS EVER RECORDED (IN ANY STYLE OF MUSIC). READ THE LYRICS FOR THIS SONG, IT ACTUALLY APPLIES TO ALL OF US IN THIS MESSED UP WORLD OF OURS. UP THE IRONS!!!
B000060OFT|5.0|Perfect is the only thing I can think of to describe this movie. Cinematically stunning, *beautiful*, tragic... The acting is impeccable, doing Shakespeare more than justice, doing him proud. The greatest love story of all time is redefined with a sassy, gorgeous style that is a stroke of pure genius. And the special features on the DVD give new insight into the movie. It's just fun and fascinating. A *MUST* for tragics, romantics, anyone really. I'm not one to easily fall in love with a movie but this one is my favorite because it is so breathtakingly wonderful.
0880796863|3.0|I have had several different versions of the Rider-Waite tarot deck.  I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with the &quot;original&quot; deck.  The colors of the cards are dull, and the cards themselves are large and awkward to handle.  The accompanying book is smaller than a man's wallet, with small print.  The author tends to rattle on about &quot;secret doctrines&quot; and really offers very little information for beginners.  I wouldn't recommend this set for anyone serious about learning the Tarot.  The other resources available today are much more easy to learn.  I'm purchasing the CD-Rom set &quot;Tarot Magic&quot;, and maybe with both I can refresh my skills as a reader.
B0000041Z5|5.0|I bought this on a recommendation from someone who shares my love for Mozart's symphonies.  I was struck by the superb sound quality of the discs.  The performances are great and I'm sure the pieces will grow on me.
6302641888|5.0|MGM has a much better transfer, and more user-friendly subtitles.  The most famous shot of the movie (shows up on the box cover of both versions) barely even shows up in the other version.  Short of a much-anticipated DVD release of this, the MGM version at least tries to come close.  A movie of this kind of beauty doesn't deserve any less than optimal viewing conditions.  If you are a Bergman buff or something, though, you might get both editions to compare and contrast (e.g., the subtitle content).  (Please note, folks: the average rating of this has been dragged down by low votes for the non-MGM version; I think almost all agree that the film itself is a 5-star affair.)
B000088NTE|5.0|Kevin you MUST get &quot;So Natural.&quot;  It is the best Lisa album around, and well worth the import price. When you hear &quot;Marvellous and Mine&quot; you will absolutely melt.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Seemingly bored with basing their acts around Nirvana, Green Day and The Deftones, it appears that some American bands are increasingly turning to gloomy British bands for inspiration. First came the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, who did an admirable job of impersonating the feedback obsessed Jesus & Mary Chain. Now New Yorkers Interpol have raised the stakes by choosing Joy Division as their basis for recording. <br />This is a particularly brave move, as there are few bands who command as much respect as Joy Division within the music press, and anybody seen to be shamelessly copying them runs the huge risk of being immediately derided. But, somehow, Interpol have produced an album that borrows heavily from the Mancunian band but which also stands alone as a superb piece of work. <br />Turn On The Bright Lights begins with the almost ethereal \\"untitled,\\" seemingly lulling the listener into a false sense of security before the second track, \\"Obstacle 1,\\" is unleashed. A truly disturbing song, it manages to borrow from just about every aspect of Joy Division's sound: the grinding bass, jagged guitars, robotic drumming and even the vocals, as Paul Banks' croons, \\"You'll go stabbing yourself in the neck.\\" <br />However, it would be unfair to suggest that Interpol draw from only one influence. \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\" could easily have been recorded by The Strokes, suggesting that gloom isn't the only tool in their box. Normal service is resumed a track later, though, with \\"Hands Away,\\" which incorporates haunting synthesizers over some even more haunting vocals. <br />The standout track is probably the relentless \\"Roland,\\" which from the very start threatens to spiral out of control but somehow retains its sanity, again exhibiting all of Joy Division's menace and intrigue as it rattles along. <br />If sounding like Joy Division doesn't seem serious enough, it is worth noting that in a move reminiscent of Trent Reznor recording The Downward Spiral in the house in whichCharles Manson slaughtered Sharon Tate, Interpol recorded their debut in an abandoned hospital once used to house mentally disturbed children. The finished product would certainly suggest that the band responded to the environment in which it was created. <br />It would be very easy to discount Interpol as plagiarists, if only the album wasn't so powerful. Just as Joy Division's two albums possess a genuine ability to move, Turn on the Bright Lights leaves the listener emotionally drained in places, and there aren't too many records that can achieve that. It's bound to upset some, but even the staunchest Joy Division fan can't fail to admit this is strong stuff. <br />It seems strange that to be seen to be borrowing from what is widely considered one of the greatest groups of all time should be considered such a crime, whilst it is perfectly acceptable to imitate lesser bands (Embrace impersonating Oasis anyone?). Interpol should be applauded for integrating Joy Division-esque moments so well, certainly better than anybody else that has tried it over the past twenty years. Give them a chance. They certainly deserve one. ...
B000067J1H|5.0|see it and you won't ever forget it.
0804106304|5.0|I have to admit I saw the movie before I read the book but I was so curious I just had to get my hands on it. The book is always better right? Well I have to say I think I enjoyed the movie just as much, if not more, than the book. I guess I'm just a sucker, but what heartache! I felt every betrayal, every lie, every hopeless decision these women had to make in their families lives. If you're a woman, of any race, these books should be a rite of passage. It's so heartwrenching to see what few options these women really had, and how they had to succumb to their husbands wishes in order to keep their families together.
B00007CVSH|1.0|First of all,don't waste your time and money on this one.Villarroel was aweful( no wonder the Met cancelled her run of Trovatore this season ),she always fell short of the high note and had such poor breath control.Cura and Hvorostovsky were totally miscast,neither of them could tackle the coloratura demands of the beautifully written opera. ( Though I am usually a fan of Hvorostovsky ).The only principal that could sing decently was Naef, though she was not believable for her role.<br />The best Il Trovatore DVD available is the one with Gencer,Barbieri, Del Monaco etc. ( However it's a dubbed version and sometimes can be annoying ).The second best is the one with Sutherland in the Australian production.Dame Joan was near the end of her career but still shines with her sound Bel Canto tecnique.The rest of the cast sing decently and is overall pleasant to watch.The Met production with Pavarotti and Marton is worth watching because of Pavarotti. Eva Marton was a great singer but was totally miscast in this role.The Met should have taped a year before with Pavarotti and Sutherland in 1988.( her operatic farewell to the Met )That would probably be the best possible cast.That production was boring though.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Ever since I've got this album, and that happened soon after it came out, I just fell in love with this music. I'm a big fan of an after-hours music, like Sinatra, Billie Holiday or especially Tom Waits did, but Norah Jones blends them all into a very unique form that you can't overlook or overpass. This is by all means the finest album of 2002 and I can hardly wait what she'll do next. <BR>A great stylist and a fine songwriter, too.
0066214122|4.0|In the novel, Prey, by Michael Crichton, the author uses rising action to effectively tell the story of the possible negative effects on society of advancing technology too far.  In this case, the technology involves a combination of nano-science, information science, and biology.  The results are nano-particles that take on the characteristics of a rapidly evolving, intelligent biological species.  Jack Forman, an out-of-work Silicon Valley engineer, becomes increasingly suspicious about his wife's behavior and her secretive work with these nano-particles.  As he seeks to understand and then to destroy the technology, he faces the danger of being exposed to the swarms of particles.  The risk and consequences of exposure increase as the swarms of nano-particles evolve and become more powerful.  The frustration of not knowing the whole truth about this technology and the need to find out amplifies the tension and holds the reader in suspense, waiting for Jack's exposure that could very well be deadly, or life altering. The novel, similar to an action movie, starts with small, abrupt encounters with these nano-particles and then builds up to the eventual head on, highly dangerous confrontation between the man and the manmade technological nightmare.<BR>To Crichton, portraying the protagonist's thoughts is as important as describing his actions.  During every tense moment, and sometimes during the less stressful ones, Crichton portrays the rush of thoughts that surge through Forman's head.  Not only does he keep up the protagonist's train of thought, but also he tells what thoughts Jack Forman reads from the other character's actions and appearances. Crichton has certainly done his research, and the many physics related quips and statistics really add to the intelligence of the story.  This book is enjoyable because Crichton spends a fair amount of the time discussing physics and the ideas of future computer technology.  The storyline seems character driven.  Crichtonhas assigned unique personalities to every character including the nano-particles.  Perhaps Crichton even incorporated himself in one of the characters, so that he might live in his own created world. The unique characters and the physics and other science accompaniments incorporated in the story make this an entertaining and educational read.  <BR>Overall, Crichton's Prey is a brilliant novel. Because of his use of rising action to increase tension and excitement throughout the story, he is able to keep readers turning pages to find out what happens next. The unique personalities of the characters, the incorporation of science details, and the foresight into the negative consequences of not managing scientific advances appropriately bring much insight into what could be possible in the future of technology.  Prey deserves at least four and one half stars, for the excellent storyline, as well as for making the reader think about the potential risks of technology out of control.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|The year was 1987. By the end of the decade, many film producers and directors had established themselves among hollywood's finest and the getting was better than ever when it came to screenplays and visual effects. In addition, it was also a time for newcomers, such as dutch director Paul Verhoeven. Having been lured to the U.S. by this film project, which his wife, of all people, finally convinced him to take up, it seemed worth the time and effort for all who were involved. The result, in my opinion, was a \\"contemporary classic\\". Not only does the film tell an unforgettable story of vengence, laced with several scenes of extremely graphic violence, but it also has so many social, not to mention political, themes embedded within, it's not funny. Bottom line, if you base your opinion of this film solely on its gruesome content, to say the least, then you should watch it again. Because you would have missed the other half of the movie the first time around!
B000002UEB|5.0|I personally am a sucker for concept albums. Maybe the story isn't always as good as a book, but these guys are musical artists not authors. In this case though I think the story is great and Queensrche's musical tatent only adds to what is already an outstanding story.<BR>    Those who critize and say that the people who review these kinda albums are Prog-Rock nerds that give 5 star ratings to every concept album are morons that don't know the first thing about musical tatent or good songwriting. I am a music fan of several kinds of music...Rock, Classical, Rap/Hip Hop, and Reggae to name a few with a large collection of albums speading through several genres and among the many albums I have, this is in the top 5 I own. I highly recommend it to any Prog-Rock fan or music fan period for that matter.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Okay, it's been awhile since this movie came out and the &quot;Titanic phenomenon&quot; has since disappeared, but after reading some people's reviews of the film, I felt it necessary to add my thoughts. Not everyone is going to like this film. In fact, a lot of people probably won't. For a lot of people, this movie will just be about a mediocre love story added to a tragedy, solely intended to boost sales of the film. And let's face it, it did. We all know that the prime viewers of this film were lovestruck teenage girls, helplessly drawn into the love story of the &quot;doomed Jack and Rose&quot;. The producers of &quot;Titanic&quot; and James Cameron all knew this. That is one of the reasons that this movie was such an incredible blockbuster at the box office. I am not a big fan of movies that will add a love story into the tale of a terrible tragedy, just to make money. However... knowing all this does not keep me from liking the film.<br />The Titanic was an epic ship. It was the largest ship of it's time, equal only to its sister ship, the Olympic. When it sank on the night of April 14th, 1912, it was an immense tragedy to all the people of it's time. 90 years later, it still continues to fascinate the world. The story of the Titanic is not just about the sinking of a ship. It's about those who left loved ones behind to save themselves, those who refused to leave their loved ones, those that gave up their own lives to save others. It's about why the disaster happened in the first place, those that could have stopped it, those who really never understood what was happening. The heroic actions of the people on the ship, and the disgust you feel at those that acted less than heroic. In other words, the Titanic is about REAL PEOPLE. Real people traveled on the Titanic and lived the real experiences that were shown in this movie. Some survived. Most did not. Those that died, died terrible, tragic deaths. Those that lived, were left with terrible memories of what happened on that fateful night. Memories and experiences that they would never forget. This movie brings those stories and experiences to life. Yes, a love story was added to appeal to those that wouldn't normally be interested in a film like this. However, no matter how you look at it, James Cameron's &quot;Titanic&quot; shows you the doomed stories and heroics of those that sailed on the maiden voyage of the Titanic. So as you watch this movie, take the time to think about the truth behind it: real people went through this terrible tragedy... and real people died during it. Maybe that might put a little perspective into your initial distaste of the movie &quot;Titanic&quot;. I hope that there are enough people in this world that still feel compassion and mourning for those that were on the fateful maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Post Nirvana, I became disappointed with much of what was being played on the radio. Very quickly the music scene went from tribute, to originality, to total dreck. For the extensiveness of my indie CD collection (which should have theoretically satisfied the void) I wondered if I would ever see another band melding true alternative and pop sensibilities with a twist of politics to make it in the mainstream.<br />And then....I got a hold of this album.<br />First, I am roundly impressed a band of male musicians penned and wrote a song strongly against domestic violence (Never Again) because even in today's more sensitized world, this is a really daring move that will undoubtedly elicit criticism from people who do not understand it, or who secretly do and are scared of the inevitable. Here is proof that Alternative rock in it's best form (like the folk music of my parent's generation) actually stands for something.<br />Seccondly, the two hits &quot;How you remind me&quot; and &quot;Just for&quot; are really that good. Well aware the record companies often attempt to decide what will become a memorable song, the guitair and vocal arrangements on both tracks certainly qualify them for the honor. Quite honestly, there were times when I did feel as if I had boarded a time machine back to the excellent parts of the early 1990's.<br />Because tribute bands can (and do) mean anything from really good to really sell-out, I was initially apprehensive about purchasing and listening to this CD. Even if I liked the radio cuts, I did not want to waste hard-earned money on something that produced mediocre music. Glad my worries were soundly disproven, I cannot emphasize enough this CD should be a part of everybody's collection.
B000002NIW|5.0|This CD is simply amazing. Deftones have always made beautiful, poetic, and brutal music, but this is by far their best. Songs like &quot;Dai the Flu&quot;, &quot;Lhabia&quot;, and &quot;Mascara&quot; are purely amazing. Wonderful lyrics and extraordinary music make this rock album a must have. Not a single song on this CD isn't worth a listen. Around the Fur is one of those CDs that you can listen to over and over again like it is one long perfect song. It just flows in and out of the guitar riffs and haunting vocals that make Deftones albums, especially this one, so beautful.
B0000635NG|5.0|Norah Jones' music is mellow and laid-back, it's true. But it's also very good indeed, which is why she was Billboard Number 1 with this album. Soulful, talented, different - excellent.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|the funny thing about this album is most of the stuff IS them covering their own songs, albeit in english. i was studying russian in school, and a friend of mine pointed out their album to me (which is now in my computer, in russian *nods*). although their translations aren't anywhere near accurate, it doesn't matter, because the extra base and synth lines in the american versions are extra rocking *g*
B00005JLO2|1.0|This film is another Hollywood attempt at historical revisionism (this time to a fictional work). I walked out 2/3 the way through the film. The only people it will appeal to are the [crusaders] marching in the streets in protest of the war on terrorism. Just be thankful that Martin Sheen or Susan Sarandon were not in the picture. <BR>A far superior version of the Four Feathers, though made on a much smaller budget, was the TV version starring Jane Seymour and Beau Bridges.<br />Anyone who wants to see a quality \\"historical war film\\" ahould purchase Zulu,Gettysburg, or, better yet, wait for the DVD version of \\"Gods and Generals\\".
0195067142|5.0|Short, sweet and to the point. \\"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa\\" is the very best personal memoir on World War II that I have ever read to this pint.<br /><br />Sledge's book very thoroughly depicts the physical, mental, and emotional horrors of battle -- in chilling detail.  Sledge's first-hand experience and understanding of youth lost and manhood discovered during war is truly terrifying. He illustrates the gloomy environment of death; the ear-pounding and eerie sounds of suffering and dying men, the foul stench of death, and the bitter taste and experience of men - brave yet afraid during combat. Their sleepless night in cramped, waterlogged, infested fox holes with the Japanese just one heartbeat away from death.<br /><br />Sledge writes about their fears and trepidation and of heir bravery and camaraderie -- or brotherhood. The brotherhood these men had for one another is what got them through those horrible times. . . . Sledge describes the emotional pain he and his comrades felt at the loss of one of their brothers-in-arms. All readers need do is read a chapter, put their heads back, close their eyes, and he or she can visualize what these brave young American soldiers went through to defend America.<br /><br />If there was a Pulitzer Prize for personal memoirs it would surely go to Eugene B. Sledge for his book, \\"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa\\". It should be required reading in all American History classes. His book serves as a reminder of the contributions and sacrifices made by these young men. . . .
B00007LL7O|5.0|Actually Timo Tollki is a musical genuis , and Stratovarius are one of teh best bands to appear. They contiue doing a great job , not disappinting any one . Elements is great melodec power heavy metal album as all of of Stratovarius album. In this age of grabage modern rock , alternavtive or death metal. Startovarius says \\" No , Listen to the real from us \\" . This what Elemsnts says.<BR> Elements shows that Startovarius and Tolkki are great musical composers, able to write symphonic heavy metal music while mainting there touch. Elements has everything that a Startovarius fan expects. I think this album is better than Infinte, it might not be there best release (not as good as Visions) , but it is not less than any other album. And contains in my opinion five songs that can be regareded as classic Startovarius songs ; \\"Eagleheart\\", \\"Fanatisa\\",\\"Elements\\",\\"Learning To Fly\\" and \\"Startofortess\\". And the album is not just about Eagleheart, Eagleheart is a great song , just as \\"Hunting High and Low \\" for \\"Infinte\\" or \\"SOS\\" for \\"Destiny\\". But the amazing musical , symphoic and guitar combinations are appearnt in the two epic traks \\"Fantaisa\\" and \\"Elements\\". \\"Learning To Fly\\" is my favriote of the is album , a great fast rocking song with great job on th eguitar from Tollki. Having some symphonic or aritisc work on the album is not a draw back , it is a bounus if u realy appreatie heavy metal and good music, it shows how much Startovarius are creative as musicains, and how much there not a casual band. <BR> They only drawbvack for this album is that the song \\"Run Away\\" on the \\"Eagleheart\\" is not there on the album , it is a grerat song. Try to buy the version that has this song as a bouns track , it is a great song , that has an intro which is different from the traditional Startovarius style.<BR> If you like Startovarius , buy this album<BR> IF you like heavy metal , buy this album<BR> IF you enjoy good music , buy this album<BR>Even if you only like classical music , buy this album , you will not be disappointed. Hoping thet Elements part two will be as good as this one.<BR> Startovarius rocks and Kotiplito is a great singer.
0393317552|1.0|Let me start by saying I have studied anthropology, forensics, anatomy and entomology.  When I picked this book off the shelf I said &quot;Now, this is the book for me!&quot;  From the first page, I found it to be the most boring, repetivive and predictable read I have ever experienced.  I had more fun reading undergrad papers about moth pheromones.  As some other reviewers mentioned, the author seems to put &quot;stone-age&quot; cultures on a pedestal as he tries to make Westerners feel bad for existing.  Not really what I was hoping to get from this read.  I actually fell asleep numerous times, trying to trudge through this.  Hey, if you want bo believe the 5 start reviews, knock yourself out.  I would sell the book, used but it's currently acting as a kickstand pad for my motorcycle...
B0000844I8|4.0|After two previous DVD's for this movie and the powers that be finally got it right. This is one of the greatest action adventure movies ever made. Adding DTS Surround Sound has put this film in a league of it's own. Superb sound and picture quality are well worth purchasing. WOW!
B000069AUI|5.0|After great success from Coldplay's original hit single, &quot;Yellow&quot; who knew there was more to them. This quartet from Merry Old England boasts one of the most ingenuitive cds of 2002. From beginning to end A Rush Of Blood To The Head is close to flawless. It starts off with the dynamic rush of Politik and careens through a masterpiece of an album finishing off with the melodic opus Amsterdam. A Rush of Blood mixes Chris Martin's Dave Matthews-esque vocals with radiohead-like Brit Pop Rock that creates a flow of ear candy. 9/10 Highlights: &quot;Politik&quot; &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot; &quot;Clocks&quot; &quot;A Rush of Blood To The Head&quot; &quot;Amsterdam&quot;
B000088E6M|5.0|This is a classic cd.  You can just put the cd in and let it play.  The lyrics are incredible.  If you are a hip hop fan this is a must have for your collection....then again, if you are a true hip hop fan, you probably already have it.  50 has everybody from the hood to the burbs singing his praises.  If this is what we have to look forward to, I can't wait for his next album.
B000025XE5|5.0|The Troggs are almost considered a one-hit wonder for their famous &quot;Wild Thing&quot; [not to be confused with Tone-Loc's song of the same title]. Who else had a sound with a tasty metallic edge, and also managed to get all the way to #1 on the charts with a truly funny seduction song? (The Kinks &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; and Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot; were more at social satire, and thus 'half-serious'; plus they didn't make it all the way to #1. But doesn't &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; have an utterly astonishing sound to it!?!?)<br />In our new era of nearly indestructible media, it's conceivable that &quot;Wild Thing&quot; will live forever . . . any healthy 10-year old [or hormone-raging teenager] hearing it from now until eternity will instantly identify with, and cherish it.<br />What's not usually known about the Troggs is possibly the most titillating rock song of all time [&quot;I Can't Control Myself&quot;], and possibly the best slow love ballad of the psychedelic era [&quot;Love is All Around&quot;]. The lyrics and the playing/singing of &quot;I Can't Control Myself&quot; still get my chakras spinning pretty fast. Some well-crafted rhymed lines (there are plenty more good ones): &quot;your slacks are low and your hips are showing&quot;; &quot;this kind of feeling can move a nation&quot; - but it's also how they are sung, and how they jam out from their musical context. The song is a strong tonic. To hell with Viagra . . . just play this song a few times!<br />And &quot;Love is All Around&quot; still makes me melt. What are its nearest rivals for best radio rock ballad of the late 60's? Right off the bat I think of &quot;Time of the Season&quot; by the Zombies, which, however, is a little quick-paced to be considered a true ballad, as is Johnny Rivers' &quot;Summer Rain&quot;. There's &quot;Get Together&quot; by the Youngbloods, truly a heavyweight contender. Tommy James and the Shondells had a brace of terrific slow tunes. The Rascals' offerings, however, are also a bit too quick-paced to qualify. What about &quot;Something&quot; by the Beatles?<br />&quot;Something&quot; (by the Beatles) is like a 60's upgrade (gorgeous as it is) of Bing Crosby (gorgeous as he sounded some twenty years before); it is good enough that it easily transcends the era from which it has sprung.  For our purposes, the Troggs' ballad goes one better, serving as a steady conduit by which the sense of eternity which expressed itself in late-sixties music and culture can still be heard and felt (especially by many of those who lived it). It channels the energy of the late sixties like a true icon of the era, as much as &quot;Something&quot; overflows those half-dreamed boundaries. The greatness of the Beatles' multi-temporal eclecticism notwithstanding, my vote goes to &quot;Love is All Around&quot;.<br />And let's not forget that the Troggs were one of the inventors of British punk . . . which as it were, was not really invented, but sort of 'sprang from the earth'. The Who, the Kinks and Them came before the Troggs; and we can't forget the Rolling Stones, the Animals and the Yardbirds [though these three had a more bluesy than a metallic edge]. Then there were literally dozens, possibly even scores of American bands (starting in '66 or even earlier) playing off the energy and sounds of these influential British oracles.<br />By the way, (if you have never listened to it) the song &quot;Night of the Long Grass&quot; is NOT to be missed!ascals' offerings, however, are also a bit too quick-paced to qualify.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is an amazing,absolutely flawless musical journey.You can actually sit there, and listen through the entire thing,without having to skip a single track.Besides \\"dirrty\\",every song has depth and meaning.Christina's artistic input is very evident,and throughout these amazing 20 tracks you get to see the amazing qualities Christina has as a lyricist,song-writer/producer.Her voice is extraordinary,and has matured so much since her early years that I cannot even believe that this is the same girl!No doubt,Christina has a voice that, I think is better than many artists twice her age,and who've been in the music industry for decades.She can sing anything,and sing it with conviction.There is a huge variety of music,so there's something here for everyone.The amazing maturity in the music is also very evident.There is no trace of \\"pop\\",and with no doubt is in a class of it's own.This cd is also a big inspiration for me, and I think,will be for many other people,as Christina writes about stuff that anyone can relate to.And I think that all the people who complain about her image need to shut up.Christina is a singer,and it's her own right to choose how she wants to present herself.She's a young beautiful woman who is here to entertain you with song,not parent your children.So if you can't handle that, then don't complain!In conclusion,I'd like to say that there is not a single bad song.Every track has something to offer.Stripped is a joy both to my ears and heart.I want to thank Christina for creating this musical masterpiece.This is more than just an album, it's a revealation,a portrait.Thank you Christina for creating such beautiful music,and thanks for sharing your talent with the world.You'll be around for years to come.If you don't have this record,then GET IT!!!It should be in every music lover's collection.This cd is da bomb, and I cannot stop listening to it.One of my favorite cd's, as I'm sure it will be yours.Now after you are done reading this review,scrollback up, and order this cd!Or run and get it at your nearest music store!!Because this record is made for all ages,all races,all people.Now if that's not good enough, then I don't know what is!
B000069KGM|5.0|One of the greatest debuts of all time, one of the greatest double albums of all time, now one of the greatest remastered CDs of all time.<br />This is Chicago with all members at the height of their powers - they were young and hungry and didn't have anything to prove. Without exception, all of the songs are superb. &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; is, of course, unlistenable, but nobody's ever claimed otherwise, and besides, it isn't a SONG.<br />&quot;Beginnings&quot; is probably as perfect a love song as has ever been written, but all of these songs, and the way they are played, combine to make the whole listening experience a breathtaking one. And of course, with this re-release you can now enjoy proper packaging as you listen instead of changing sides. Just don't forget to programme the CD to miss track 7.
B00005JLZL|4.0|I'm afraid that a number of reviewers were perhaps expecting this movie to make a stong anti-capital punishment statement. It did not. If that was the intent, the studio would have titled it \\"The Death of David Gale\\". People expecting a strong statement supporting abolitionist views will probably be disappointed.<br />What the movie is, however, is a good story well told. It is a taut thriller, well paced and finely acted. The plot contains more twists and turns than a country road and requires the viewers constant attention. Kevin Spacey's character ranges from the highest peaks to the lowest depths and is always believable. For comparison, I thought his performance surpassed the (award winning) Russell Crowe role in A Beautiful Mind. In one scene, Spacey, in a drunken stupor, assaults a phone booth. Paul Newman's performance attacking parking meters in Cool Hand Luke pales in comparison. If not for the timing of the movie's release, this would be a guaranteed Oscar nomination for Spacey. Laura Linney's performance as a ailing activist is also quite good. Her character is difficult to embrace, but her performance is not.<br />I was impressed with the operational aspects of the movie including the cinematograpy, lighting and editing.  All were well done.  The unusual musical score fits well with the story and has a syncopated rhythm like a clock ticking off the final minutes and seconds of the main character's life.<br />If you like dramatic thrillers and enjoy trying to figure out \\"whodunit\\", then you should enjoy The Life of David Gale.
0061092037|5.0|We hear much of how the media of the world is controlled by the hands of a few men.  THis fictionalized account of Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwells fight over the worlds media empires will help all those interested in how the media operates in the world today(or more precisely in the 1990s).  This book is also a superb read, it combines the flair of real life with the fictionlized account of the private affairs of two great men, both of whom a flawed.  A great character study.  By far it is Archers best work.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie captures the spirit of the sci-fi action genre.  Unfortunately the studio that released it was too much of a chicken to hear what the general public had to say about it and only heeded the \\"professional\\" opinions of film critics.  It's amusing that when \\"The Matrix\\" was released, critics lambasted the movie, yet it managed to capture the hearts, minds, and imagination of a very diverse audience.  I believe critics have some insight in the film industry.  But, they were severly wrong with this one.<br />\\"Equilibrium\\" has some incredibly low-key but first-rate actors. They brought the timeless sci-fi tale of an authoritarian society which is rebelled against by those seeking \\"freedom,\\" to life and to a whole new level.  Every aspect from the cinematography to the story-line is captured and executed with breath-taking grace.  But, be forewarned.  If you are looking for \\"The Matrix: redux,\\" you will be disappointed.  While the two can parallel each other to some degree, Equilibrium is a whole other tale and should be given notice for completely different reasons.<br />\\"Equilibrium\\" I believe will have to wait for its hey-day on DVD.  But, trust me, I intend to be the one of the first to purchase it.  I will also probably thrust it into the hands of every person who has not yet had a chance to experience one of 2002's most overachieved, yet underrated film!
0671799320|5.0|I am glad for a book of this stature.  In light of todays criticm of Big Oil and its role in the Iraq conflict this book explodes the myths sourounding the american oil empire.  This book shows how a small group of dedicated HARD WORKING individuals worked to make the American oil induistry the best in the world.  THis book is so broad in scope that it touches on every spect of the industry, including the Russian Oil Fields of Baku, the importance of oil in the world wars, the North sea oil fields, Mexican oil(PEMEX), and Venezualia, along with the politics sourounding the \\"oil weapon\\".  A superb account that should be read by everyone, except that its extraordinary length preclude the ability of the average reader to do so.
B000006SBY|4.0|I have been a BA fan since 'Waking Up The Neighbors'.  But I only owned the album, 'So Far, So Good'.  I have since been on a crusade to buy every single BA album.  This one eluded me, until I finally decided to buy it on the web (had the usual first time buyer fears, etc...).  But it was a reasonable price.  I like this album.  Very 80's sounding (a lot of keyboards to my ear &amp; plenty of guitar), but you can hear the direction that Bryan will take later.  It's a good first album and sets up his 2nd album, 'Fits Ya Good'.  I'm happy to say that I now have all of BA's albums, and I love everyone one.  My only complaint with this CD was that the lyrics were not enclosed and I had to get them off BA's web site so that I could learn the songs that much faster.  Good buy if your a BA fan.
038533558X|4.0|Eleven years ago Julie Miller, Will Klein's former girlfriend, was raped and strangled in her basement. By Will's brother, Ken. At least, that's what the police think. And the facts certainly seem to add up. Ken hasn't been seen in his suburban New Jersey neighborhood since that night and his family's decided to consider him dead -- even if people all over the world have reported seeing him -- until Will's mother, on her deathbed, tells Will that Ken is alive. And Will finds a photograph of his brother, taken long after he supposedly died. Only days after this, Will's new girlfriend and soulmate disappears, leaving him only a note saying she'll love him always. When the FBI shows up at Covenant House, Will's place of work, and starts asking questions about his missing girlfriend, he gets worried. He's even more worried when he learns her fingerprints have been lifted from a New Mexico homicide scene. Can he, with the help of his buddy Squares (yoga guru with a boxed in Nazi symbol tatooed on his forehead), a newspaper reporter in New Mexico, Julie's little sister, and a former hooker, summon up courage he's never thought he had to unravel a tale so complicated it may cost him his life?<br />While GONE FOR GOOD is cleanly written, tightly plotted, and intensely absorbing, it borders on incredulity. The twists and turns are so varied and numerous as to leave the reader going \\"Wait a minute!\\" and putting the book on hold while he tries to figure out how things could have possibly worked out this way. While this is not necessarily bad, I tend to enjoy books more firmly planted in realism and not in the sort of stories that fuel national tabloids. However, I thought Will's and Square's working at the real-life Covenant House where they drive the night van that picks up homeless kids was a nice touch, even if the House has lived through some bad scandals in the last ten years. I enjoyed Will as a lead character ... and felt the characters remained true to their types, even if their types were a bit far out. And although I felt the subplot about Squares and his wife and baby (does no one in this book have a normal life?!) was unneccesary, the rest of the plot held together seamlessly.<br />If you enjoy tightly written thrillers with bewildering twists and turns and unguessable endings, GONE FOR GOOD is sure to please.en if their types were a bit far out.

B000066C1N|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for Spirit...I had no idea about what music was going to be on the soundtrack.  They used some other country song for the trailer.  I found out that Bryan was doing to the soundtrack because he was here in Phoenix doing a local morning show and talking about the movie!  Ahhh!  That's when I heard the first single, \\"Here I Am\\".  I loved it!  I went to Target to buy the soundtrack.  Of course, my sisters didn't like that I sang through the whole movie.  I just love Bryan's voice.  It set the tone perfectly, the songs matched the 'spirit' of the West.  I have also now brought the DVD for Spirit (nice featurette about the music of the movie with Bryan and Hans Zimmer).  I have all of Bryan's albums...can't wait for the new album later this year (fingers are crossed).  Great buy and well worth it for BA fans and it's a great kids movie.
0316666343|3.0|The beginning that has been immortalized ... on her way home from school in December of 1973, fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon (as in the fish) is lured by a neighborhood man into his underground hideout, raped, and murdered. Now up in a peculiar sort of heaven where her textbooks are Glamour and Vogue, her favorite place is a gazebo, dogs frolic all around her when she wishes for them, and she is desperately alone and motherless, she looks down on her bewildered and broken family and friends as they search for her killer and try to pull themselves together to face a life without her. This is her story.<br />It seems no one in this country (except possibly my mother) has missed at least thumbing through THE LOVELY BONES. Seldom has there been more fuss over a debut novel. I must confess, I am bewildered by the hubbaloo. While this novel certainly has a promising beginning and a first chapter strong enough to propel the reader onward, it soon founders in paragraphs that have seemingly little to do with the main plot -- whatever that is. The characters are flat, their emotions unrealistic, heaven a dismal proposition, and the ending unsatisfying. However, that said, somewhere in this story there must be a certain power because I found myself so depressed and heartbroken after the first five or six chapters that I had to either put the book down or forfeit a good night's sleep. Whatever Alice Sebold has created here, it is haunting.<br />Readers interested in a coherent storyline without sentimental ramblings will probably find this book disappointing, but if you are touched by the odd, the lost, the mourned, and the strangely beautiful, THE LOVELY BONES will break your heart.
B00003CXSP|5.0|THIS MOVIE IN NO WAY SURPASSES (SILENCE) BUT IT STILL STANDS OUT AS A GREAT FILM AND SEQUAL.ANTHONY HOPKINS RULES AS HANNIBAL LECTER.JULIANNE MOORE DOES A GRAT CLARICE BUT IN NO WAY COMPARES TO JODIE.THIS IS WORTH BUYING DON'T WAIT BUY THIS MOVIE NOW.
0441003257|5.0|I knew nothing of Terry Pratchett or Neil Gaiman when my husband handed me GOOD OMENS to read. Once I finished the first chapter I was hooked forever. This is one deliciously warped view of the apolcapyse, complete with a devil who scares plants into growing, four \\"horsmen\\" who ride Harleys, and some of the most brilliant puns in the English language. Don't miss Death, who is the best character in the book: all irony, sarcasm and speaks in capital letters.<br />After all the belly laughs, I became a devoted Pratchett fan, and I highly recommend his Discworld books. Gaiman, is a much darker writer, and appeals to me even more.<br />If you are in any sort of blue mood, pick up this book and you'll be instantly transferred to humor heaven.
B000063DIR|3.0|I heard DOAM for the first time about 18 years ago. The music was obviously phenomenal and has held up well over time. I'd put the musicianship in that band up against any other 80's metal band. And without a doubt, it blow away anything anyone in the 90's was producing.(Aside from a select few virtuoso's)<BR>My favorite song by Ozzy is and always will be Diary of a Madman.<BR>It's the reason I play guitar today and my inspiration to become a better musician. But if you've heard the album, you already know what I'm talking about.<BR>On to the sound quality of the remaster.....<BR>It's horrible. It is such a blatant attempt to change the once so successful formula, just so that the Osbournes can pocket more money, that it makes me sick. Randy would never approve.<BR>But then again, put yourself in Ozzy's shoes....<BR>He has a couple moron children that will depend on his money for a lifetime, so he better make as much as he can now. I don't see Ozzy making it another 5 years even. Jack? Please... what future do you see for that kid if Ozzy doesn't make sure he'll always have money. In summation:<BR>The songs on this album rock<BR>The remastered music on this album sounds subpar and unnatural<BR>Randy is rolling over in his grave right now having his music messed with.<BR>Ozzy has to rake in as much $$$$$ as possible to save his idiot children from themselves.<br />I'll give it 3 starts, because at one time... Ozzy did rule.
B00004X0ER|3.0|I would give them 3.5 stars...<BR>This is a great follow up band from Sweden.

B00005JLXC|3.0|the movie was strictly action, a lot of gore, and many fight scenes.  the movement was hard to follow when Daredevil used his \\"senses\\" at some times but other than that the fight scenes were okay. the plot was horrible and so was the acting for the most part.  if you want to see a movie with lots of action,okay fight scenes, and a lot of eye candy this movie's for you then.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I love a wide variety of music and this particular album stays in my player all the time. I think it is just really original and well done.

0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway is a wonderful tale of a young American who has come to fight in the Spanish Civil War.  Robert Jordan has come to fight for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War against the Fascists from being a Spanish professor in America.  As an explosives expert, he is assigned the task to destroy an enemy bridge for an important offensive attack by the Republicans.  He travels behind the lines and meets up with a Guerrilla band lead by a war weary veteran, Pablo, who is troubled by his bloody past.  Also present at the camp is an escaped prisoner named Maria in which Robert falls in love with.  Over the 3 days that Robert is present at the camp, he, as well as the guerrilla band, battle toil with fears concerning blowing the bridge.  Pablo and his bold wife Pilar can both feel the tragedy that is certain to come at the bridge, but unlike Pilar, Pablo is not devoted to the cause and tries disable the mission before changing his mind and coming back.  This, along with Robert's growing emotions towards Maria and his own struggles over death pose the real conflict throughout the story.  For Whom the Bell Tolls is an amazing love story as well as a war novel telling the story of the anguish of war.   This book will forever symbolize the grimness of war.
B00006RIO7|5.0|So I get to the theatre with tons of anticipation...

B00006HBUA|2.0|I thought that this was supposed to be like the cartoons but when I saw it, it was not as good as I thought it would be. For one thing, Freddie Prinze, Jr. is not Fred. The movie was not that scary and had little humor. While you can sense the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby Doo, their scenes got a little bit weird. As the movie got on, the mystery started to get confusing. All in all, this was not a very enjoyable film.
B000059H98|3.0|As a DVD, it is lacking. If ever a movie begged to be \\"revealed\\" it is \\"Tank Girl\\". How someone ever got the budget to make this quirky movie is beyond me. A great sales job! The lack of content knock this down a star.<br /> As a film, I give it 4 stars. There are some visible flaws in production value (dispite the enormous \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" factor) That sort of cheapen the film. One prime example is the \\"ripper\\" claws, used to sever limb from body, flopping around like rubber... ...claws in closeups. But that's picky stuff. The animation sequences, mostly used to speed up the explanation of extranious details, are actually top notch and enhance the let-it-fly attitude of the movie. Hard core Sci-fi/Comic fans don't give this film much due (at least the ones I know). I told them I had \\"Tank Girl\\" and they just groaned. So I guess renting is in order if you have not seen this yet. Lori Petty is absolutely spastic. I can't imagine everything she did was in the script! This is Ice-T's acting debut... ...as a Kangaroo!! He does a passable job. Here's a few \\"hints\\" for those without a clue:<br />-I bought this movie in the Comedy section at [...]!<br />-Dispite it's zany, spastic attitude, Tank Girl is good Sci-fi.<br />-The first time I watched the DVD, I was totally entertained.<br />-Don't expect anything to make allot of sense. This is spastic comedy in the tradition of \\"the Monkeys\\" (yea, the TV show!!).<br />-Dispite this, there is actually a cool, simple story with emotional attachment to the characters.<br />-Special effects are pretty slick.<br />-If you know this film, kind of like it, but aren't sure you want to own it, you can get it new for cheap.<br />-Don't expect realistic machinery. Paint often changes vehicles structural makeup in this film (I.E., long wings become short and move down, and then back up again!!)<br />-If you can't suspend reason for 90 minutes, don't bother.
B00006JMQG|5.0|There have been a number of versions of this film. My original copy was an 8mm one. The is clearly the best. It is not significantly different from other recent releases except it is cleaner, the tints are more interesting and what is especially good is the recreation of the original style of the text for the english titles. The choice of two music tracks is fun and after listening to the contemporary one, I switched to the more traditional version. The condensed version of the film Genuine was also of interest.<br />For those who, like myself, love this classic example of early German silent film I cannot recommend this new release highly enough.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|As someone who has never played the game, I am looking at this strictly as Film entertainment...  YEEHAAA!!!<br />Let's not get carried away, this is not Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Not even close.  Here's the breakdown;<br />-It is to \\"Treasure seeking adventure\\" as Resident Evil is to \\"Zombie Horror\\".<br />-If you're looking for high art, this is not for you.<br />-If you want challenging plot that keeps you guessing... nope.<br />-If you enjoy lots of action held together by an extremely simple plot, you can't go wrong.<br />-For what it is (pure action movie) it is very well done and entertaining.<br />-I was never insulted by dialogue or story because I wasn't expecting to be challenged, just entertained.<br />-It's certainly better than one star.  That's just snobbish.<br />-It's not for everyone. Rent it first.<br /><br />This is one of those \\"put it in and let it go\\" kind of films.  Great after a stressful day.  Not a lot of thought required, but engaging entertainment.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|Not only do most of the songs sound the same, its formula techno-pop junk. It goes from boring, to boring, in 45 minutes... Its pretty [bad]. What you heard on the radio or on TV is all they have to offer.
B000069AUI|5.0|Way back with their first album Parachutes, so purchasing this album was a no brainer!<br />The singles which are currently airing on radio stations:<br />In My Place<BR>Clocks<br />Are alone worth the purchase of this album. However, the other tracks shouldn't be ignored.<br />A must buy for any Coldplay fan. A great addition to anyone who loves Brit-Rock.
B000000HU0|5.0|Shamal is close to my favorite Gong records. Daevid had begged off the band completely and Steve plays on just two songs. The band masterfully begins to develop as a fusion unit. Wingful Of Eyes is a masterpiece in commercial fusion and flows fresh even today! Didier Malherbe executes some Bamboo flute solos on a lot of the record that are truly mystifying. Patrice Lemoine's keyboards are gracefully understated. Mireille Bauer brings the renowned vibes sound we associate the band with to a fuller fruition. It is a wonderful piece of prog rock art with a jazzy funky edge. Yet it is still spacey in the Gong tradition. Pierre Moerlen starts to take over but he hasn't completely done so on this record. His percussion is stupendous and yes, they were trying for some commercial sucess. Heck the legacies of the band had either split or sat in for a session or two. Fusion purist do not like this record because it is not instramental. The space cadets don't like it because it is not spacey enough. In is right inbetween! Perfect spin!

B000002NHN|5.0|No words can do this album justice! It is exquisite. If I had to choose only one track it would be track number 8 &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot;. It is a masterpiece!
B0000065TL|4.0|I've seen the Girlie Show which I thought was spectacular but as a behind the scenes look this was okay too. Though I think that it skirts the insight of her as a businesswoman, teh labogorious meetings, teh lawyers, the accountants, the business structuring and also very limited access to her home. This also needed a reporter of some kind asking her definitive questions, a shadow reporter if you will.<br />Though the freestyle works of sometimes simply being a fly on the wall, there seems to be some shielding to who she is. Which is troublesome on one level and applaudable on another. We shouldn't have TOTAL access to her life, she deserves privacy as we all do, even if she has chosen the public spotlight. But at the same time what is her goal here?<br />Did I get to know Madonna better? Somewhat but there's so much flurry around her that often times its hard to see if she's orchestrator or along for the ride or perhaps some days there is no difference.?<br />She's interesting, yes. But at the same time strident and I don't think thats because she's a strident person but because there is so much for her attention to manage. And at the same time 99% of the people around her are on her payroll or subject to her whims. It puts her in a position where for her artistic vision she may want to get her own way and at the same time she has to constantly war with the maturity of listening to others and deferring. It must be a hard balancing act to maintain control and flexibility when the whole show is YOU.<br />Admirable.
1573225517|5.0|High Fidelity tells the story of Rob, a thirty-something record store owner who is growing increasingly unsure of himself. Not only has his girlfriend, Laura, just moved out, and his business started to suffer, he's begun to look retrospectively on his life and realized that his relationships have never really worked out. Confiding in the reader, he takes us on a journey to find out just why that is.<br />High Fidelity, I found, works on a lot of levels -- although they're perhaps levels that you wouldn't expect a novel to work out. As a love story, it's not going to touch your heart. As a tragedy of everyday living, Rob's story isn't going to make you cry (Rob doesn't deserve much sympathy very often -- and he certainly never demands it!). As an epic, well, it's just a story of an everyday guy.<br />But High Fidelity undeniably strikes a chord. It's contemporary and legitimate and everything a modern novel should be. It deals with issues of growing old, when to start a family, our own insecurities (and the insecurities in others we often don't see), measures of success, money and relationships, friendship... all the good stuff. And it's one helluva ride getting there, too. Hornby's prose is wonderful -- brisk and hilarious. Hornby has a good eye for the ironies of everyday life, and the ironies of Rob's life. The story's told in the first person perspective, which is handled flawlessly. Everything's pure Rob, and as anybody who's seen the movie (which rightfully, stays true to its source material) knows, he's quite the interesting person to be around.<br />It's a novel that's hard to critisize. If you're not a fan of contemporary writing and stories about modern urban society, you're not going to like this. There's little I would call timeless or objective about this novel. It's not Romeo &amp; Juliet. But if you're looking for something contemporary, something hilarious and touching, you're not going to find a better novel than this one.<br />Matty J
B000062XM7|5.0|The best part of the movie is when Lewis has to leave Stowe because they will all be captured and all killed so he is forced to abandon her. He turns to her and tells her &quot;Whatever you do, stay alive!&quot; More powerful than telling her I love you, more powerful than any passionate proposal. The compelling part of the film is the chase and running of the film and the complex racial and political issues. This is a terrific film, its an excellent interpretation of the book and a great film to boot.<BR>Madeline Stowe, as always is a beautiful, compelling actress who uses her abilities of both beauty, strength and compelling emotion to the Nth degree here. This film first turned me on to them and while Lewis got an Oscar, Stowe has yet to receive hers but she deserves one as well.
B000002RA1|5.0|This is a contender for being the greatest album of all time. I really mean that. I have had several spiritual orgasms listening to this stuff. \\"You Shouldn't Do That\\" is a work of pure genius, and if it were a painting, it would make sense to take down the Mona Lisa and put this song up in its place. I love the song \\"Adjust Me\\" just as much. I think the psychological state of nirvana might sound like this album. I have been in love with it for ages. Imagine a group of people with extreme musical creativity and talent combining space music, heavy metal, jazz, and folk into one form. That is this album. (Hawkwind had several other great albums in their early days, by the way.)
B0000501C3|3.0|First,I have to admit I am a maniac or ReinHard Goebel.He is the main master of some great moments in old and baroque music. What he did to change the spirit and the cadence of baroque music change my way of listening to this kind of music. You just have to listen to his interpretation of the concertos brandbourgeois. I had great attempt about this Cd. I was really disappointed. After tring a dozen times to love this music, I just have to say I never listened to it anymore. It's make me irritable and nervous. Just a matter of taste. It's difficult to be objective when you don't like this kind of music. The pieces I prefered are not from Lully but from Jacques Cordier (la bocanne primitive et compliquée ). I never find the authentic Goeble effect. Short cuts, strange puzzle. It's a movie music. That, perhaps, is the main problem. But the recording is deep, rich and includes some interesting surprises. <br />I prefered \\"Tous les matins du Monde\\" (Biondi and Savall)and  the music recorded on the free bonus Cd. To my own wiew, it has been a better choice.
B00004T9UH|2.0|First things first: this is the CLEAN version of the cd. OK, so saying, thats why i gave this a low rating. It's not the best of eminem's cds, but its still good. However, the clean version is HORRIBLE. You can barely listen to it, so much is bleeped out.They even cut out dumb stuff like \\"cut\\". The only thing I like on this cd is the song \\"the kids\\" which i cant find on the unedited version of the marshall mathers lp. its a very good song even though it is edited. so my advice to u is to get the unedited version if u like eminem. its a good cd, worth the money.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|I had only seen inferior prints of this classic up til now. I am more than pleased with this edition. It looks and sounds fantastic. I was finally able to fully comprehend the story. When anything is done that requires great effort, there are always those who are never satisfied---as evidenced by some of the reviews. But everyone has their personal preference. I am amazed at the care and painstaking detail with which \\"Metropolis\\" has been handled here. It's worth every penny to invest in it as the collectors' item it is. Some missing scenes have been replaced with title cards to bridge the gaps but this is a small issue compared with the whole of what is there. The unforgettable images and scenes of the underground machine workers as well as the creation of the robot \\"Maria\\" are just beautiful and pristine in quality. The erotic dance scene with the robot Maria is nothing short of eye-popping---considering this was 1927. But it's the timeless message of the film that lingers also...\\"the mediator between the head and the hands must be the heart\\". What a beautiful statement. The heart is there in this restoration and it shows. After the debacle of \\"Day of the Triffids\\", it's good to know that someone still cares about quality. To me, this version of \\"Metropolis\\" is all that and then some.
0060934913|3.0|Kitchen Confidential is very entertaining at times, as Anthony Bourdain takes the reader into the kitchens of big time restaurants.  It's hardcore cooking done at high speed and great organization despite the apparent frenzy.  There is a particularly interesting chapter devoted to a restaurant man simply known as &quot;Bigfoot&quot;, who is Bourdain's role model; a man who knows what's going on at all times and has exacting standards in the kitchen.  <br />Less riveting is Bourdain's own story moving up in the ranks.  His experiences as a rookie line chef in Provincetown are somewhat amusing, and his time at the CIA (Culinary Institute of America) is a look at the more formal cooking training which Bourdain contrasts with the high octane New York kitchen scene. Other anecdotes seem self-serving, so be advised it's okay to jump ahead; the chapters have different themes and stand on their own.    <br />One isn't shocked by the author's frequent profanity at first, but he goes way overboard with the gratuitous F-words and comes across as very arrogant and juvenile.  He also goes on and on about using cocaine and heroin in younger days, which is totally unnecessary and one wonders why he seems so proud of it.  If you can get past his obnoxious nature this book is still an interesting read.
B00005RHGK|5.0|At a time when the \\"Scream\\" wave has left every teen horror film in its wake awash in tongue-in-cheek tributes, self-aware teen heroes and killers who learned their trades from movie monsters, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" is an eerie return to old-fashioned scary movies. You get the sense writer/director Victor Salva really takes this seriously. The story isn't exactly original -- Trish (Gina Philips) and little brother Darry (Justin Long) collide with a shadowy creep in an ominous tank of a screeching, screaming truck on a road trip through the back highways of nowhere -- but Salva spins a backwoods serial killer setup into something really scary. <br />Darry's unfathomable curiosity takes them to the mystery man's cellar. It's an absurd and illogical thing for the kid to do, but it leads to the film's most unsettling and imaginative moment when he finds a dank cathedral of death. The scene sets the mood for their desperate race with the devil as an otherworldly evil burns through the natural order. Expect the usual tropes: Urban legends, dotty psychics, skeptical cops and bickering kids who make outrageously bad decisions and babble hysterically under pressure. Salva makes it work with a minimum of disbelief and creates eerie wonders with ominous imagery and scares in the dark. Where he falters is giving away too much information, taking his white-maned killer out of the shadows to reveal it in all its demonic glory. It's the same with the story: He's eager to explain when mere suggestion is much more frightening. It's a forgivable weakness in such a dark, doomed ride through a house of horrors. The ending is faulty but effective and somewhat silly. This is a seriously UNDERATED FILM! Those who diss it are morons. See this and forget about Scream!
B000002MI4|5.0|What an irony : one of my favorite recordings EVER, but I can't think of one person to recommend it to. My rocker friends wouldn't last 10 minutes into this as they await the drums to kick in, and my friends of the classical persuasion would give Elvis' &quot;unclassically trained voice&quot; even less audition time. My ongoing &quot;desert island&quot; top ten rotates over time, but Juliet Letters is a permanent fixture on that list. Now, if they'd just release the 1-hour PBS concert/documentary on DVD ...
B00005RHGK|5.0|The creeper is the new bad boy on the block. Joining the likes of Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, and Candyman. This is an incredibly eerie film that used the power of suggestion (for the most part) and that is where it does great in. The Creeper is probably the only serial killer that could fight and possibly beat Jason Voorhees as strongest serial killer. Anyway, this movie is incredibly underated. Those who gave this negative reviews liked Scream so what does that tell you. Others got to worked up over the fact that they showed what the monster looked like, which was a mistake, but it didn't destroy the films' intense atmosphere. This is a must see for horror fans. Watch it alone in the dark!
B00006CXXU|5.0|this girl is the most talented singer/songwriter i have EVER heard! Christina has transformed into an incredibly mature and overwhelmingly impressive voice over the years. This album compliments her to the fullest extent possible and makes you want to listen to it again and again. Being an aspiring singer, I can't think of any other current voice to look up to other than hers. BUY THIS CD! IT'S A 10!
B00005RHGK|5.0|&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; leaves you with an unsettling sense of loss, period! Down with the debunkers and complainers! What do they know, everyone else who saw this movie thought it was scary, so why is so criminally underated? This is incredible with it's atmosphere, and next to Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees, well let's just say it would be a good fight between the three of them. Jeepers Creepers 2 is coming out so before you see that watch it alone in the dark.
6303269869|4.0|This is actually a very good movie, in spite of the fact that I personally hate Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia.  I was about to stop watching after seeing the first 15 minutes, but after sticking with it I thought the movie was excellent not just because it addresses issues with alcoholism, but issues about conflicts in family life and barriers to communication, which happen to be quite common in general.<br />Even if you remove the topic of alcoholism completely, you can see how the movie deals with issues like what happens when the person you are married to is no longer the person you married?  What do you do when someone you love is hiding things not just from others but from themselves?  What issues come up when a couple starts to see a licensed practitioner?  What is it like to enter a support group, especially when you have judgments about the types of people that make up the support group?<br />I would have given this movie five stars if not for my personal distaste for Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia.  But this movie really opened my eyes, and perhaps more importantly, my heart, and I would recommend it to anyone who has experienced a troubled relationship, due to alcohol or not.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|One of Joan Crawford's best movies.  I was so glad that it finally came to DVD.
B00005JLZL|4.0|I was lucky enough to be invited to an advance screenig of this film, despite the fact that I was no Kevin Spacey fan.  I am a changed person.  This movie is interesting and emotionally complex.  Critic's reviews pan this film as an over-the-top, preachy anti-death penalty movie.  It couldnt be farther from the truth.  Sure, this film will get you thinking about the death penalty, but it probably won't change your mind.  It is a simple thriller with a plot twist so inventive, you'll never guess whodunit!  I recommend this movie.
0440539811|1.0|Easily the worst book I've ever read.  The first 100 or so pages were interesting but it slowly and painfully degraded into an incoherent, disjointed pile of [garbage].  I did finish this book, but only to prove I could.<br />Don't let this book's cult status fool you.
0393317552|1.0|This book is a 100% reverse racism, where indigenous people are smarter, more intelligent than white people are, although - I guess - white people were indigenous 1000 years ago for Greeks or Romans. The concept of the book is one sentence: The development of civilization is based 100 % on geographical location. (And because Eurasia has the best location thus its people are the most developed.) Believe it or not, we learn at the end of the book why Europe is more developed than China is within Eurasia itself in just 2 to 3 paragraphs. You will be amazed to read it is because of Europe's coastline. <BR>Do not buy or read this book it has nothing to do with science, it is a cheap mainstream reverse Mein Kampf...
B000066NW0|5.0|I think Avril is very talented.  Some people think her lyrics sound like they've been written by a 5th grader or something, but I like the fact that her lyrics are simple because girls, like me, can relate to them.  BTW Avril never said ahe was punk.  Anyway, I'm going to review all the songs! :)<br />1. Losing Grip-The refrain sounds heavy metal or something.  I like the words, though. 4/5<BR>2. Complicated-Her first single. I still like it, though! 4/5<BR>3. Sk8er Boi-(I like how that's spelt!) Her second single. This is definetly pop! One of my favorite songs on here. 5/5<BR>4. I'm With You- Her current single. Lots of people like it but it's just not my thing. 2/5<BR>5. Mobile-Not good, not bad. 3/5<BR>6. Unwanted-Very edgy! One of my favorite songs on her album. 5/5<BR>7. Tommorow-Avril has a nice voice.  The lyrics are nice, too, but the melody is too slow for me. 4/5<BR>8. Anything but Ordinary-I dunno, I think this song is kinda wierd. 3/5<BR>9. Things I'll Never Say-I love this song! The lyrics are so cute. They're about liking someone and being all nervous when your around that person. 5/5<BR>10. My World-Another one of my faves. A cute song about her home town. It's acually a little peppy! 5/5<BR>11. Nobobdy's Fool-Hate the rapping suff...ech! I do like the words, though. 3/5<BR>12. Too Much to Ask-One of my faves.  One of the &quot;better written&quot; ones. :) 5/5<BR>13. Naked-The lyrics are kind of confusing but I like the melody, Avril has a nice voice. 4/5<BR>Well, there's my review.  I'm not gonna tell you to go out and buy the album, but personally I think it's a great CD. :)
B00003CXXM|4.0|Great action guy flick. It reminded me of The Saint, however, Matt Damon has a greater range as an actor then Val Kilmer. Overall the story is fast paced and action packed. Also the chick in the movie is a POA
B000069AUI|5.0|Even if you are in to country or even folk music, punk or pop this album suits everybody! Every song is different and you can tell that Coldplay have not written down just any old thing. This album is at the top of my CD collection and it should be at yours just for the pure talent of Chris Martins soulful voice. This is a CD to treasure all your life!
B0000648WZ|1.0|For those who have read the true &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; by the fantastic sci-fi novelist Robert Heinlein, this movie is an abomination of that name. The only thing in common is the character names, the rest is a crude insult to one of the best books, in my humble opinion, in the genre.<br />Mindless action, mindless acting and a bit of nudity is all what this movie has to offer, which is fine for the general public (The nudity, I'm sure, will please), but absolute horse-do for fans of the sci-fi genre, and fans for Heinlein.<br />To reiterate, the director of this movie must have hated Robert Heinlein, a *triple* Hugo award winner, as the movie retains nothing of the complex social arguments and explorations which were astounding and ground-breaking. Keep in mind this novel was written in 1959, before space travel, before computers were widespread and many of the other aspects of life we take for granted.<br />Watch this if you're in for mindless action and a bit of a laugh at the shallow acting, but definately DO NOT WATCH if you've read the book, as I found out the hard way.
B00006IUL7|4.0|A wonderful role for Robin Williams! A film unlike any other for Williams. A film that is worth watching along with his new film &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot; Both films are worth watching over and over.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This broadway production made into a movie was fantastic. Seeing Richard Gere tap dance was extraordinary. I loved hearing everyone sing, and i sugest everyone to go and see it.
B0000025F7|5.0|Before all of the face lifts,underaged sleepovers, and babies hanging over balconies there was &quot;Off The Wall&quot;. This was the album that showed the world that little Micheal from the Jackson 5 was all grown up! The album came out during a time(1979)when the music industry was overflooded with vapid and exsessive disco and bland and dull corporate rock. &quot;Off the wall&quot; came along and showed that music could be universal and inspiring again. Mixed with the funky dance beats of disco, The melodies of rock, and the soulfullness that had long been missing in music. This album sort of capture's an innocent yet mature Micheal. Innocent that he had not yet been corupted and ingulfed by the wierd alien like presona that is sadly the king of pop now. While his next effort &quot;Thiller&quot; was an amazing album as well I cant help but feel that the fresh innocent Micheal was  was allready showing signs of disapearing and allready morphing into the weird, Nora Desimond like persona. For a taste of a young fresh Micheal before all of the strange BS I would recomend picking yourself up a copy of &quot;Off the wall&quot;
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the most lovely, most compelling books I have ever read.
B0000028RR|3.0|if you like loud angry music and want a change from your old stuff, check this album out. I admit that I had to play it a few times before I started to enjoy it. Yes, the lyrics are cheesy, but the actual music is good for working out to, or doing busy work at your job. Take this album for what it is(Loud grooving music) instead of a horribly flawed commentary on society. Those who attempt to analyze this album on that level are missing the point entirely.
0553062182|5.0|For a quarter of a century, I battled with the &quot;drawbacks&quot; that come with being born a highly sensitive person. And it was only made worse by the fact that I sincerely thought there was something wrong with me and that I was sure I was alone in my particular awareness of the world around me. I fought my way through depression and anxiety and, somehow, by the grace of some higher power, ended up with Dr. Elaine Aron's book in my hands. It shed light on the fact that there was nothing wrong with me, and that there were, in fact, very special and good qualities in what I am. I am ever thankful to Dr. Aron for writing this inspiring book. Because of her reassuring and illuminating words, I now have complete faith in my emotions, my senses, and my sacred sensitive mind.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is one of the best I've heard in a long time. In an age where boy bands and rap dominates the music scene, Andrew W.K. captured the essence of hair metal.  With loud guitar riffs, slamming drums, and , oddly enough, classical piano.  I think the way A.W.K. incorporates his talent for piano into rock and roll sets his music apart.  \\"I Get Wet\\" is a breath of fresh air from the generic rock of today and should not go unnoticed. So do yourself a BIG favor and pick up a copy of \\"I Get Wet\\" today. PARTY HARD
0553212737|4.0|In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen.  This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it.  One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith.  Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax.  Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love.  Austen uses<BR>irony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.<BR>     Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious.  She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton.  Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"`Let<BR>me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38).  There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty.  Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.  <BR>     There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank.  We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together.  There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him.  All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.<BR>     Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along.  Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley.  Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister.  It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.<BR>     The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid.  With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible forthe reader to realize what<BR>is actually going on.  This adds to the surprise ending.  How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading.
B000002IGV|3.0|THe guitar work in this album is something amazing. J.J. French and Ojeda plays so simple, it´s almost &quot;childish&quot; compared to today standars. But, hey, it works!!<br />Snider has a strong voice and the lyrical subject of the songs are very good.
0440180295|5.0|I was never really impressed with the story line of this book, it was on line with what i'd expect from Kilgore Trout.  But i couldn't put it down, have you ever heard a voice so beautiful that it dosen't matter what it sings just as long as it sings? this is how Vonnegut writes.  He takes a cheesy Sci-Fi plot (by the way i love sci-fi) and makes one of the greatest pieces of literature to be written in the last 50 years
0805066691|4.0|I'll keep this short.  The fact that Mr. Brown uses quotes and accounts from soldiers' own court testimonies lends a great deal of credibility to the book.  Although the negative reviews here seem to slip into dramatic instance (ex: Well, my great-grandmother didn't experience that, so the book is flawed.) and selective observation, I would counter that this book presents history that McGraw-Hill is likely to never put in their textbooks.<br />It's a tough, slow read and rather dry which, again, lends somewhat to the credibility of the information.
B0000508U6|4.0|This cd is pretty good, although I did expect it to be better... This is a VERY mellow cd, borderline depressing... With that said, I do think Coldplay is very talented &amp; I do have several songs on the cd that I enjoy...
0767830555|5.0|Travis Bickle asks a girl out on a date, and takes her to a porno film. He sucks up to a political candidate, and ends up alarming him. He tries to make small talk with a Secret Service agent, but the agent is forced to back off. He wants to befriend a child prostitute, but scares her away.  Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is the story of a man who tries to connect but cannot.<br />Taxi Driver was Martin Scorsese's fourth film and I believe it to be his best, though I have an equal love for almost all of his films. He does a cameo in this and it is possibly the most memorable scene in the whole film. Paul Schrader, a great director in his own right, provides the script. Schrader started in film criticism, was fired, had no money and was forced to live on the streets. Taxi Driver is what came out of that. The score was Bernard Herman's last and it's a fine farewell to a great composer. Just like the cinematography, the music puts us inside Travis's head.<br />The film has a real dream-like quality to it and it's no doubt that that comes from its wonderful and obscure cinematography. There are shots in this film that are just astounding but there is one in particular I will never forget. Travis calls up Betsy asking for a second date and slowly the camera dollies over to the empty hallway and stays there for a minute but it feels like a lifetime. I always felt, and I hope this is right, that this symbolizes Travis's loneliness. <br />Robert De Niro gives one of the most chilling performances in film history and certainly, one of the best. Everything he does in the film is so right and I feel that it really wouldn't work if anyone else played Travis. Another Martin Scorsese regular, Harvey Keitel, turns in a surprisingly funny performance as a pimp called Sport. The scenes between these two legends are largely improvised and serve as some of the best scenes in the movie. A few of the other players are Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle and Cybil Shepard. All of these performancesexceptional.<br />\\"You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here...\\"<br />One of cinema's true classics, Taxi Driver should be seen by all.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I really like this cd. It's a very mellow cd to relax to. I think this cd has a poppy edge, yet there is something graceful about his music. I think it's definitely worth buying.
0380002930|5.0|I don't understand why people are saying teenagers won't like this book.  I'm thirteen and this just so happens to be my absolute favorite book of all time.  There's so much adventure, mixed in with intriguing mythology, spine-tingling horror, and even some humor sprinkled in, that this book is impossible to resist.  <BR>It starts when a group of rabbits are forced to leave their home before it is destroyed by housing developers, and from there the adventure doesn't let up.  They encounter everything from a big scary seagull to two other nightmarish warrens, and all the while we learn more and more about rabbit mythology and how they live.  There are one or two slow parts in the beginning, but once you get past those you'll be in for the ride of your life.<BR>I was SO disappointed to finish this book.  I've read tons of good animal fantasy books, but nothing holds a candle to this one.
6304118392|5.0|I am just another person living life the best as I can in this monotonous world.  The first time I saw this film, I didn't understand what the meaning or point behind this feature was!  I was puzzled and lost in the movie.  It seemed chaotic,like there was no direction of what was going to happen next.  It was unlike any other film I had seen.  I watched it again right after I finished the first time, left with nothing but confusion.  The second view however, was different.  It was a movie about a girl,(like most American girls), who was abused by her father,(SEXUALLY)and her mother was denying the situation, she knew everything and yet did nothing.  Then along comes Mickey.  This was her escape from the nightmarish world she had known and so she took it.  Unplanned and unmapped murder happened.  They killed her parents in a rage of madness for the evil that had been instilled in her.  Then when it was over she told her brother,\\"your free Kevin\\"! That in itself is a bold statement,explaining the horror he had witnessed and grown up with. So then they take on a world of drugs, both mental abuse from parents + physical, counter act with their judgement on life.  They are lost, but they love each other, and will stop at nothing to continue the crazy world they have created for themselves.  <BR>      Then without knowing what is going on around them, they have become famous.  The media,at this point, steps in and makes stars out of them.  They almost praise them for as much killing as they have done.  Trying to understand why they do the things they do.  Whether it be good or evil.  The media, in real life, is like that!  Whether it's actors,famous presidents,personal life or singers, or KILLERS, people didn't understand this film or try to go along for the ride, they analized it instead and wound up hating it!  And to deny the fact that media makes everything extravagant, it happens, all day, everyday.  It's all about money. Whatever it takes, sometimes even death to that person.<BR>       I personally think Oliver Stone has a wonderful gift of talent to be portrated on screen.  He was smart when picking the actors and actresses in this film.  He thought about Woody Harrelson's backround and he knew he would be perfect to play Mickey.  He knew without saying or asking that he had a past of abuse and to see that without knowing is a gift.  And Juliette Lewis was also perfect, she has a much talented gift for acting then she is given credit for.  I have seen her in all her movies.  She is not a sex symbol for women, but she has beauty that is unforseen often one to many times.  <BR>      This film was hated by so many because of it's ugly truth about today's world.  It wasn't pretty, it wasn't real, but in a sense of reality it did touch us where it didn't feel good.  But that's what made this film one of the best films made today.  The directors cut was a totally different image than given, when they cut out certain words, scenes, facial expressions, and choas the film wasn't as good as it should have been.  Watch the directors cut in it's entirety, and be more open minded of the point he was trying to portray.
0446677450|4.0|As many other reviewers have said, it is a good book, but it is a little light on specifics.  It is great for absolute beginners like me to get a basic understanding of the various ways that one can achieve financial freedom.  Of course, Kiyosaki is a businessman and wants you to buy his other books, whcih you need to do to get the real information.  If you don't need the motivation and have a pretty good understanding of the basics already, skip right to his other books.  If you want an excellent introduction, read this one.
B000002LQR|5.0|With the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, The Red Hot Chili Peppers elevated themselves into the stratosphere of musicianship. Rick Rubin, producer extraordinaire, arranged for hours of extended jams every day for weeks in a secluded mansion before recording. This led to the insanely catchy hooks that saturate every single track on this disc. Flea and Chad are truly one rhythm section, anticipating eachother's every move. John's guitar is full of funky licks that accentuates every nuance of the meter at just the right places. Anthony's vocals are in thier prime here. This is the Red Hots at the height of thier creativity, I'm afraid. So if you are a fan of One Hot Minute, Californication, or By the Way and do not own this disc it will truly be worth every cent you spend on it. It is one of those that makes you wonder how you got by without it. It is also one of those that make you wish that there were more just like it.
B000000WHX|4.0|Massive Attack's first CD &quot;Blue Lines&quot; shows the promise of great things to follow, and follow it does with their subsequent releases &quot;Protection&quot;, &quot;Mezzanine&quot; and the new &quot;100th Window&quot;.  This album, while not quite as haunting, dark and brooding as their subsequent releases, shows the start of a winning groove.  That they inspired several great acts to follow in their footsteps is an accomplishment.  If you think that this album was recorded and released 12 years ago, you can see how ahead of it's time it was.  This CD should definitely be part of your Massive Attack discography.
B000002INR|4.0|Skid Row's debut album was interesting. Most of the talk about it was that \\"Youth Gone Wild\\", \\"18 And Life\\", & \\"I Remember You\\" were so great. Well, they are. It seems that the rest of the album was overlooked. For a first record, this is excellent. \\"I Remember You\\" is one of the best ballads EVER. Everyone I know loves that song. \\"18 And Life\\" & \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" are songs that troubled youth (at the time) could recognize with. \\"Big Guns\\", \\"Sweet Little Sister\\", \\"Can't Stand The Heartache\\", \\"Piece Of Me\\", & \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" are great tunes. \\"Here I Am\\" & \\"Makin' A Mess\\" are just fancy filler. \\"Midnight/Tornado\\" is a good way to end a album, even if it's not the greatest tune. I highly recommend this CD to any fan of hairband metal.

B000002IQW|5.0|Just think if Skid Row could have stayed together. Their first album was excellent. And then this follow-up is even better. In fact, it was maybe the best hard rock album of the early 90's. There is not a bad song here. It didn't have the HUGE 3 hits like the last one did, but this is an all-around better record. &quot;Monkey Business&quot; was the lead-off single and was great. &quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot;, &quot;In A Darkened Room&quot;, &amp; &quot;Wasted Time&quot; are all excellent ballads. They are not sappy at all and shows that even heavy bands can do ballads. I still don't know how Sebastian Bach can even talk anymore. At the end of half of these songs, he just screams and holds his voice so long, I thought he would just pass out in mid-singing. This album is much heavier than their first one. It's a good lead in to their next record, which was their heaviest. I don't really have any 'favorites' other than the songs I menioned. Every song here is good, and this is one of my favorite CD's to this day. Buy this now.
B000001DWG|5.0|Este disco es unico en su clase, gracias a esta banda empezó el movimiento grunge en serio. Espero no molestar a nadie con este comentario, pero Kurt Cobain, no es el icono del grunge, quien conoce de este movimiento, bien puede darse cuenta, que ANDREW WOOD, hubiese podido emerger como el rostro del género, sin embargo todos conocemos la triste historia. Aún así nos dejó este legado de música, en donde su estilo es particular, la creatividad llega a sus limites en cada canción, es mucho mejor disco que el nevermind de nirvana, ya que conserva el espiritu de un movimiento que sigue vigente, el underground, el grunge...<BR>y este no dejara de serlo hasta que llegue otra banda como muchas otras a hacer del grunge underground algo comercial.<br />Simplemente la raiz de todas las bandas que ejecutan el genero<BR>disco en el que se plasma el coraje en &quot;stardog champion&quot;, el angústico &quot;stargazer&quot;, y la melancolia de &quot;man of golden words&quot;, que demuestran el potencial de andy para interpretar su ira y su dolor, y demostrarnos con esto que tenia una buena propuesta, con una calidad que hasta hoy muy pocos pueden igualar.<br />O ¿Acaso Kurt tiene algun disco tributo hecho por sus amigos, inspirados en la música de este mismo?<br />Chequen a Temple of the dog.
0375757295|5.0|The experience of reading _Persuasion_ is closer to that of reading _Jane_Eyre_ than it is to reading _Emma_ or _Pride_and_Prejudice_. Anne, our heroine, is a cut above those around her. She suffers through her social life and keeps her observations to herself. As in Austen's other books, there's plenty of wit to enjoy from the outside. But there's also a deep identification with Anne that brings out the poignancy and suspense of the romance until by the last twenty pages I could hardly stand it. And ahhhh, the payoff. Wonderful.
B0000024SI|5.0|Everything was changing on the music scene in 1965.  The Beatles were starting to write stronger more meaningful songs, The Rolling Stones were beginning to make more of a commercial impact in North America, The Byrds had just shown up on the scene with their own type of folk rock and of course Bob Dylan was going electric.  Although he had already gone electric to some extent on his previous album 'Bring It All Back Home', it is on 'Highway 61 Revisited' where Dylan goes even further into the rock genre.  A lot of folkies were really upset at him for supposedly turning his back on his folk roots.  However if you ask me, Dylan was simply too diverse and too creative not to get into the rock genre.  He definetly couldn't go on strumming his acousitc and blowing his harmonica forever.  Sometimes changes need to be made and it wasn't like he abandoned his folk side completely.  I think when he went through the change he still managed to keep a firm grasp on his musical origins.   <br />The album's music is definetly Dylan at his most diverse and creative.  Most of his early albums (except 'Bringing It All Back Home') depended on his brilliant poetic lyrics to \\"colour\\" the album.  However on 'Highway 61 Revisited' (and 'Bringing It All Back Home') we still get to hear Dylan's excellent poetic lyrics accompanied by colourful back up band arrangements.  This makes this album more varied and diverse than any of Dylan's previous recordings.  The classic LIKE A ROLLING STONE became one of Dylan's most successful singles ever in 1965.  Simply a great song that showed Dylan was beginning to make an impact on the rock music industry.  The rockin' TOMBSTONE BLUES follows it up with Dylan's wonderful lyricism and an excellent organ sound from Al Kooper.  IT'S TAKE A LOT TO LAUGH, IT TAKES A TRAIN TO CRY is laid back country blues at it's best.  Some great lyrics on this one too!  FROM A BUICK 6 is a just an outrageous, wild, and fun fast paced rocker.  The backup band plays greaton this track as well.  The album slows down though on the apocolyptic BALLAD OF A THIN MAN.  The haunting piano playing and Dylan's calm slow monotone vocal makes this song a classic.  The album picks up again though on the melodic QUEEN JANE APPROXIMATELY.  Which a nice easy going but upbeat love song.  The title track HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED is another fast paced rock.  This track brings out Dylan's sense of humor wonderfully.  The lyrics are funny and the arrangement leads for a comical atmosphere.  JUST LIKE TOM THUMB'S BLUES is another classic.  Another laid back but melodic track that is strangely compelling.  For whatever strange reason this track just makes me relax.  The final track here is the epic DESLOATION ROW which clocks over 11 minutes!  By no means is this song overblown!  All it contains is Dylan and Mike Bloomfield's latin feeling guitars and of course Dylan's poetic lyrics!  Listen to the words on this one!  Dylan could write some interesting stuff!<br />If he had begin to make a commercial impact on his previous release, Dylan was shot into stardom on 'Highway 61 Revisited'.  LIKE A ROLLING STONE shot to the top of the charts (peaking at #2) and the album went to #3.  Dylan's biggest chart success at the time.  For a single record in 1965, this one clocks suprisingly long (at 51 minutes).  No song is shorter than 3 minutes which is great (and perhaps why this album has stood up so well over the years).  My only gripe is Bob had neglected to include the single release (culled from the same sessions) POSTIVELY 4TH STREET on this album (parhaps because of the length?).  Nonetheless this is a classic album.<br />Overall 'Highway 61 Revistied' may be my favourite Dylan album.  The again I have many faves from him!  This one however has more variety than most of his other albums.  It's rocks, it's bluesy, it's folky and there's a little country and latin influence here and there as well.  It's also got different moods whether they be angry, happy, sador down right funny!  This album showcased the diversity of Dylan and may be considered the peak of his musical career.  Every song here is classic.  His voice sounds more polished on this noe too compared to earlier recordings.  Another landmark 60's album!  Highly recommended!

B00003CXAQ|5.0|The second and possible my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy \\"Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom\\" brings the archaeologist teacher and adventurer from the Nazi-controlled Germany to the tropical jungles of India to wage a battle against a secret underground cult. Quite possibly the darkest and most controversial of the three, \\"Temple Of Doom\\" is in fact, my favorite of them and is one of Spielberg's crowning achievements in his entire career. The only trilogy that tops this in my opinion is the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I sometimes like this more than Star Wars but then again, it's a toss-up between the two.<br />It all starts in 1935, four years after the Lost Ark decimated the bad guys and caused the spectacular demise of poor Belloq and his gang, in Shanghai where Jones meets an internationally renowned singer by the name of Willie and makes a deal with a Chinese gangster leader named Lou Che and then the deal goes sour and they flee from Mr. Che's thugs on a plane. Things don't go as planned though and the plane goes down and the threesome find themselves in the tropical jungles of India where they head to a village where all of its children were kidnapped and their religious stones called Shan Kara Stones by some unknown group. Eventually that unknown group they come face to face is a dark, secret underground society called the Thuggie Cult led by Mola Ram where they perform satanic rituals worshipping Kali and use child slavery to dig in the secret underground mines to mine for diamonds to make more Shan Kara stones in the rituals. It is just mind-boggling how they manage to film some scenes considering that some places in India are forbidden from being filmed or photographed. Some of the places though in the movie are breathtaking especially the underground caves and the stunts in some of the chambers are just enough to make one hold onto the edge of their seats. This movie broke ground with some of the best action sequences that I've ever seen in a movie even to this very day especially towards the last half hour of the movie.<br />I think that \\"Temple Of Doom\\" is probably the best of the three with its suspenseful and malicious plot, and the stunning directing by none other than Steven Spielberg. Some of the background music is incredibly haunting, thus amplifying the dark undertones of the movie. I consider the second Indiana Jones movie to be Spielberg's crowning achievement and one of the best adventure films of all-time and even one of my all-time favorite movies. \\"Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom\\" would've been perfect had it not been for the excessive cowardice in Willie's character. Mary in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" was awesome and semi-rebellious and it made her such a classic, but Willie is just an annoying and helpless damsel always in need to be rescued and that keeps IJATTOD from being perfect. I think that Willie should've been more heroic but trying to put some positive things in my opinion, it's almost funny how she screams at petty things like bats, or snakes or mere lizards. Quite frankly the screaming can be annoying at times. It would've been so much better if Willie had a more 'tough', and 'tomboyish' charisma like Mary did in Raiders. Oh well. Then again, it's good to have a change in some of the characters and even Willie can be fun at times too. Mola Ram though is just awesome with his evil expression and laughing. Lou Che at the beginning of the movie was another classic one even though he wasn't a main character in the movie but his lines though and the rivalry with Jones was classic. The underground mine chase scene is one of the best action sequences that I've ever seen in my life. It boggles my mind how they managed to film that.<br />This film created controversy back in its release year and was greeted with mixed reviews from the critics and from fans because of its much darker subject. Many have said that it was too violent and more graphic but the makers of the film said that it was no more violent than Raiders was. Also, it got a lot of negative press from civil rights groups because of it portraying Indians (People of India) as poor, and bloodthirsty, and India as a desperately poor country, neither of which are true at all. India today is a blossoming democracy with lots of large thriving cities. Also it portrayed them as villainous killers with their Thuggee Cult with human sacrifice rituals and then the British as the saviors that come and save the day and even I cannot deny being somewhat taken aback by that. To the detractors, I say Boo Hoo! European colonists during the Colonial Era killed millions of Native Americans in North and South America by disease and forced population movements and also killed or enslaved Aboriginals in Australia and also of Blacks in Africa with the same or similar tactics so basically, every nationality on Earth has been either the savior or the villain! Get it?<br />Anyway, despite the controversy and the negativity, it went on to become another blockbuster at the box office and it deserved the success it got. It's hard for me to say if this one or \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\" is better but whatever weakness the two had are complemented though and I think it results in a draw between the two as my second favorite behind \\"The Last Crusade\\". Yes, some of the scenes can be too much for younger viewers, but hey, I loved this movie when I was just 6 years old, that's right, just 6 years old, and now at the age of 20, it's now one of my all-time favorite movies and is a highly recommend classic that must be included in every movie-watchers collection. I only wished that this trilogy would've continued into the 1990s or even to the present as the follow-up \\"The Last Crusade\\" was a dynamite follow-up to \\"Temple of Doom\\". Anyhow, fasten your seatbelts as you'll be in for a h.e.l.l. of a ride!it was no more violent than Raiders was.

0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas is one of the best movies of all time.  This really isn't ever the question.  Scorsese packs a whollop in this film that just can't be described adequately.  Peschi's performance, while often lampooned, is still searing in it's psychotic roller-coaster ride.  Liotta gives the most remarkable performance ever caught on film of the throes of drug-induced paranoia.  Bracco, too, turns in a performance that is typical of her calibur and skillfully multi-faceted.  The performances make this movie worth multiple watchings.<br />The DVD, however...is NOT worth your time.  Originally released in 1997, the lack of extras, while annoying, can almost be overlooked.  However, it's double sided, which means half-way through the film you have to stop and turn it over.  It completely wrecks the flow of the film, not to mention is just annoying.<br />While you can't go wrong buying this DVD for the film, when it gets rereleased in an enhanced version (I'm sure it will although I have no firsthand knowledge of this.  They can't leave a movie like this in the dust in the world of DVD, and it's DVD quality is just not there), that will be a definite must-have.
B00007BH3Y|4.0|The choral music being used in some of the tv trailers for THE HOURS is actually by Glass - but it's from the closing of the POWAQQATSI soundtrack. Odd.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Reviews in Amazon.com for 'next big thing' acts such as The Strokes, White Stripes and (more dubiously) The Vines tend to take a noticeably schadenfreude approach to the process of album reviewing, taking considerable joy in criticising as harshly as possible of the idols of so many others, hoping that, like so many promising young acts before them, they'll collapse in a heap of unfulfilled expectations and inherent talentlessness. But one suspects that this particular album will outlast such reflexive criticism, for it is, quite simply, a remarkable achievement. A surprisingly confident mixture of the Archers of Loaf, the Smiths and (yes) Joy Division, Turn on the Bright Lights reveals a band reliant neither on good looks (they don't have any) or good clothes (those suits are, frankly, pretty awful). Opening with an ethereal untitled track, with its distant guitar and self-important lyrics, one might at first be lured into thinking this will be another overproduced Mercury Rev clone or the hundredth bombastic post-rock of 2002. But then Obstacle 1 kicks in, a volatile yet disarmingly elegaic rant,  as direct and compelling a rendition on tired theme of unrequited as there has been since Nick Cave's early work. Then there's the more riff-based numbers such as 'Stella' and 'PDA', both spellbinding indie music triumphs recalling Afghan Whigs better days. Kessler's vocals rise and fall without warning, and while the verses speak of latent tensions and aggrievements no catharsis ever seems possible. Nothing is at it seems on this album, nor should it be. Interpol have been defined largely by the similes, but this album is too individual for such cut and paste comparisons, and they are more than the sum of their obvious influences. Far cooler than the designated 'cool bands' emerging from New York these days, they have produced an intriguing, arresting, and wonderfully intense album, by far the best debut release of 2002, if not the best for that year.
B00007JVBI|4.0|You could well imagine Matador's nervousness prior to receiving the master tapes for this album. Not only has it been five years since Chan released any new material, but those five years have been punctuated by several onstage nervous breakdowns, some downright strange interview conversations, and the release of a cover album produced, supposedly, because Marshall had simply lost the courage to play her own songs live.<br />Which makes this album, more beatific than her previous five releases, far better than anyone probably expected it to be. 'I Don't Blame You', the opening song, refers most openly to Chan's onstage timidity, but the rest of the album has none of the persistent, almost paranoiac fear and self-doubt that so defined 'Moon Pix' and 'What Would the Community Think'. With its biting guitar riffs and off-kilter vocals, the opening verses of 'Speak for Me' might immediately recall 'Nude as the News', but Chan seems now to have, as the album title hints, run free from most of her demons, and the harmonic chorus of the song reveals a woman who has emerged from her ordeals confident and positive. Other songs on the album are quieter, supported by a few sparse piano chords, an approach which, as with her covers record of three years ago, results either in slightly tedious mumbles or a beautiful, icy harshness (the dreary 'Names' exemplifies the former, the wonderful 'Keep on Running' the latter). While some fans may feel aggrieved that the object of their affection has been liberated from the accumultated depressions that plagued her younger years, the good news is that the cathartic core of Cat Power's appeal - her tormented, wavering yet unnerringly sharp voice - has remained intact. 'That voice' is still there, and it still enchants. While her latest album may lack the haunting, brooding wistfulness that made 'Moon Pix' and 'Community' such intriguing listens, this album is nevertheless yet another beautiful missive from one of the most unique songwriters of the last ten years.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Yea, neither was I. I had always snubbed my nose at anime because of a girl who had beaten anime to death with her fanaticism which scared me away. Luckily I was coerced into seeing Spirited Away which took my breath away. A beautiful movie full of lessons to be learned. With more substance than most live action movies Spirited Away takes you on a animated journey that doesn't limit your imagination.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|One of Spielberg's bests. Why are reviews for this movie even necessary? Moving, touching, beautiful. That's all I can say highly recommended.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I actually did not want to watch this movie when it came out and in fact did not watch it until weeks later. I saw the first Harry Potter and enjoyed it but after seeing Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter fell to the wayside. But after seeing this, I realized why Harry Potter is such a success. This movie was just great fun. The special effects were great, the actors charming, and the whole experience was just fun fun fun. Great movie.
B000000NN4|5.0|As a follow up to 'Heaven and Hell', this album seems to be wrongfully compared to it's grandiose and often exhausting high-concept predecessor.  Don't get me wrong - my favorite Vangelis recording of all time is the second movement of Heaven and Hell - which is some of the darkest and most beautiful music ever recorded.  This album, however, seems to be a more 'bare-essentials' approach to Vangelis' thick 70's analog synth sound, with phenomenal results.  I purchased Albedo 0.39 last night, and have listened to it 4 times.  <BR>The album is unmistakably New Age, but also cross-genre - encorporating elements of classical, jazz, and even contemporary rock music - though it is all expressed through synth, bass, and percussion.  Among the best tracks on the album are the kinetic opener 'Pulstar' and mind-numbing jam 'Nucleogenesis' (be patient with the first 45 seconds of part one), which is particularly jazzy.  <BR>There is also great ambient atmosphere on 'Freefall', 'Mare Tranquillitatis', and the title 'Albedo 0.39'. The latter is more of an after-thought than a theme for the album, with spoken-word facts about the Earth surprisingly augmenting the recording without overshadowing it or degenerating it to space-rock cliche.  <BR>If you are thinking of getting into Vangelis, buy this album first, then 'Heaven and Hell'.

6305127646|4.0|This film was surprisingly entertaining and interesting, it had a nice story with plenty of twists and turns. Val Kilmer makes the perfect action hero as the Saint. He manages to outwit and outsmart the bad guys by adopting a variety of disguises and funny accents. Elisabeth Shue is beautifully stunning in this film, she actually adds some wit and charm into her character. The soundtrack was an absolutely amazing work of art! The Saint has all the elements that sustain the entertainment with plenty of action, suspence and romance. All in all I would recommend this movie for an evening when you have nothing to do and want to watch a movie that you'll definitely enjoy.
B000088E6M|5.0|This album is knocking. Alomost all the songs are hot except about 2 or 3. If u didnt buy this album yet then buy it now and get a real copy and not a bootleg.

I look forward to her next cd...I see this one has been out a year...it's time for a new one!!
B000002UAR|5.0|This album, the beatles at the best. There is so much interaction.  This album is really creative.  I don't see how you can't like this album. Like how dr. robert lulls you into a sleep, then punches you in the face with the melody.  The ballad &quot;For no One&quot; is heartfelt.  The piano has great classical roots in that song, and the trumpet solo fits so well with the entire scheme of the song.  This album is certainly less poppy than their other albums.  Tomorrow never knows is a great song.  It just flows along in such a complication of things.  It's an experience.  This entire album is an experience, one that you won't want to miss.
B000002J29|5.0|...there is not a single disappointing piece on this release. The jewel of this work, if it's possible, is \\"Supper's Ready.\\" Phil Collins' vocal incantations have never been surpassed to this day. And the instrumental tightness has never been, either.<br />Just an aside, but the DEPTH of Genesis' material is no better evidenced than in \\"Supper's Ready.\\" My theory on what the title is referring too? Simply this: the Wedding Banquet of the Lamb of God, Jesus the Messiah, when the Bride of Christ is reunited with The Head of the Church, as recorded in the Bibical Book of Revelation 19:17. How do I support this? Simple again: the lyrics quote passages from the Book of Revelation, such as \\"This is the supper of The Mighty One (Who is) Lord of Lords, Kings of Kings, (Who) has returned to take his Children to the New Jerusalem\\" and \\"There's an angel standing in the sun\\"--direct quotes from Revelations 17:14, 19:16-17, and on and on . . . (too many to cite here).<br />The genius in what Genesis accomplishes could be compared to what Handel did with his masterpiece, \\"Messiah.\\"  Both successfully take subject matter and texts from ancient literature, quoting them directly at that, and make them accessible to the popular culture.<br />What DARING!  Choosing to put passages of Scripture to cutting-edge progressive musical treatment could induce (unjustified) cries of self-righteous indignation from both the faithful and the faithless.  As it is, Genesis blends these diverse themes so masterfully and REVERENTLY that all--Christian, Jew, atheist, et al--are left spellbound.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold captures the essence of youth lost in her lovely novel.  From the heartache of the first pages and the tragedy that befalls an innocent young girl, Susie, the reader is catapulted into another dimension where a young girl tries to make sense of what happened.  The writing is so magnificent that the reader experiences the events first hand; i.e., the effects of the tragedy on her family; the differing, yet basically similar emotions of her mother and father; the devoted love of her brother which allows him to feel her presence in a room and the experiences of her sister as well as the love of her grandmother as each grieves and adjusts and heals in their own way and their own time.     <BR>       Absorb the friendships of the spirit of Susie with the soul of Ruth who remains to me the dearest living character in the book.<BR>       Alice Sebold explores the poignant scenario of first and only intimate love between a young teenage boy and a young teenage girl's longing to explore.  It was intimate without vulgarity and most of all it was innocence's personified.<BR>       As a grandmother, I would recommend this book to every teenage child to make them aware of the dangers lurking and ever present that the author brings to the foreground but mostly because it is a beautiful story where, in the end, justice does prevail and love can conquer all.

0375413405|5.0|I have been a subscriber to high-end food magazines for decades, and have an extensive collection of cookbooks. This is the best cook book in print, without exception. I remember when Julia came on the scene when I was a child.  It was, no exaggeration.....innovative.  She used words we couldn't pronounce, showed us how to make dishes we were unfamiliar with, and showed us techniques that were unheard of to the American public. Almost 40 years later, the American palette has become more sophisticated and the food options available to us seem endless. This book stills holds up as the best.  It is the primer for understanding French cooking, and mastering invaluable techniques in the kitchen.<br />I love good food and enjoy cooking.  The problem is, after twenty something years cooking I still have to admit that I have no natural talent or culinary instinct. EVERYTIME I use this book I am successful. Don't let the title of this book intimidate you.  This book was written in large part with the novice in mind.
B000088E6D|5.0|This album is what I consider a \\"must have\\" for everyone's music collection!  Michael Buble is a major talent, the music arrangements are incredible, the choice of songs is delightful...I actually get chills when he sings.  \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" puts me in a trance...and I want to fly when he sings \\"Come Fly With Me\\"...can't wait to see this boy live!!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is one amazing album. For an artist to change tack as quickly and effortlessly as Beck does from Midnight Vultures to Sea Change shows real talent.<BR>Sea Change is full of melodies that will have you enthralled. Sure, he may be bummed, but it means a more creative, soulful songwriter.
B00003CXI1|4.0|i went to this movie at the urging of my fiance'. i took her to see it, sat back thinking this was just going to be an over-hyped kiddie flick. i was surprised to find that i actually found myself liking the movie. it wasnt as childish as i thought. Harry's fat-slob Uncle and Alan Rickman as the potions teacher made the movie. im glad i gave it a fair chance. good FX too.
B00005M91K|5.0|An amazing piece of work from beginning to end.
B00007JVBI|5.0|This year in music has been pretty boring so far. Nothing worth getting excited about has come out...and that's why it is all the more relieving that Chan Marshall just released the best work of her career with \\"You Are Free.\\"<br />The album's opener, \\"I Don't Blame You,\\" leads one to believe that Marshall is content with continuing along her same old path: it is a slow, piano-driven number reminiscent of the entire Cat Power back catalogue. <br />Though the song treads previously explored territory, it is already apparent that Marshall is on top of her songwriting game. The somber mood and the light hooks are executed perfectly.<br />But when \\"Free\\" chimes in after the brief moment of silence in between tracks, you realize Marshall has some new tricks up her sleeve. It makes use of a simple guitar part that is looped throughout its entirety. However, \\"Free\\" is so well written that it never gets boring. Different textures and vocals interchange seamlessly to produce a fresh, lively song. It rocks.<br />Marshall showed she was more than capable of breathing her own life into songs penned by other artists with her 2000 release, \\"The Covers Record.\\" She chose to include two cover songs on \\"You Are Free\\" with country artist Michael Hurley's \\"Werewolf\\" and blues legend John Lee Hooker's \\"Keep on Runnin' (Crawlin' Black Spider).\\"<br />The covers work very well within the context of Marshall's own work; they never really feel like they could have been written by anyone but her. \\"Werewolf\\" is especially convincing with its string-tinged, haunting persona.<br />Marshall flexes her songwriting muscle time and time again throughout \\"You Are Free.\\" The middle section of the album continues to explore new territory. This is all embodied by the album's best track (believe me, it was hard to pick just one), \\"He War,\\" which is an outstanding guitar-driven rocker that manages to be haunting and menacing at the same time.<br />\\"Maybe Not,\\" the tenth track, ushers in a retreat back tothe piano, and it's a gorgeous tune. The last few tracks of the album follow in the same somber vein, but they all sound fresh and exciting given the context of the rest of the album-and it doesn't hurt that Marshall has become one of the best songwriters alive today.<br />If Chan Marshall continues to make albums like \\"You Are Free,\\" then she will be establish herself in the same league as the classic singer-songwriters Carole King, Nick Drake, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, et al. Quite simply, this is the best album that has been released this year, and it will be nearly impossible for it not to remain among the top releases of 2003.
B00005JLO2|3.0|The most memorable shot in director Shekhar Kapur's  \\"The Four Feathers\\" serves as an apt metaphor for this 2002 version, the seventh to be filmed, of A.E.W. Mason's novel.  It is a shot from atop a mountain, looking down on a British square in the desert of the Sudan in 1898 at the Battle of Abou Clea being attacked on all four sides by an overwhelming number of Mahdi soldiers.  However, as spectacular as the shot happens to be, it puts us at great distance from the action, which is worst thing that can be said about the entire film.<br />\\"The Four Feathers\\" is clearly one of the classic love triangle stories of literature, with Harry Faversham (Heath Ledger), his best friend Lt. Jack Durrance (Wes Bentley), and the woman they both love, Ethne Eustace (Kate Hudson).  Harry and Jack are the major parts of a quintet of young army officers who are friends and spend their time playing solider and playing rugby.  But the Mahdi and his Mohammedean fanatics have risen in the Sudan and General Gordon is set to meet his fate at Khartoum, which means the call to duty has been sounded and, as the their commanding officer proudly tells the boys, their government has finally seen fit to send them to war.<br />However, Harry has more than second thoughts about going off to fight for Queen and country.  His engagement to Ethne seems the obvious excuse for his decision, but he makes noises about have objections to the British colonial presence in the Sudan that seem like out of time modern motive of political correctness.  Whatever the rationale behind the decision, Harry resigns his commission.  Of his four friends three of them send white weathers as a token of their condemnation of his cowardice; the fourth feather is added by Ethne, who breaks off the engagement.  Harry's father, a British serving general, literally turns his back on the young man as well (apparently to Harry's surprise).  The quest for redemption has begun.<br />On the one hand you have to give the film credit for not giving Harry a series of unbelievable heroic episodes in which he earns the right for his friends to reclaim their feathers.  So I find myself in the strange position of arguing that this realistic approach ironically mutes the heroism of Harry's quest too much.  The greater irony is that the most heroic figure in this film is Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou), a desert prince becomes Harry's protector because he has no choice: God put the dying Englishman in his path in the desert.  Yet even his pivotal role is kept at a distance in this film and he remains a supporting player to Harry's quest for redemption.<br />Kapur has done British period pieces before in \\"Elizabeth,\\" so there are no real complaints about the look of the film (the inevitable comparisons to David Lean's classic \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" are somewhat misplaced; the film is more in the tradition of \\"Gunga Din\\").  But the story and the performances keep the audience at a distance.  Perhaps this is because by now the story of such love triangle has been played out so much that its utter predictability has stripped away all of the emotional value.  I just know that I was stunned to discover that when we finished watching this Heath Ledger film that they wished we had watched something else instead.  But seeing as how the Harry who completes the quest for redemption does not seem that much different from the one that began the film, I have to agree they are right.edit for not giving Harry a series of unbelievable heroic episodes in which he earns the right for his friends to reclaim their feathers.

B00006LSM3|3.0|Everyone has a favorite Beatle, and George Harrison gets my vote. He was the quiet, modest one who stood in the shadow of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. I always root for the underdog ... but I don't go to the extremity of the Ringo fan. That's just crazy. <br />It is important to note that Harrison survived an attempt on his life when a crazed fan stabbed him in his home in December 1999. He undoubtedly was aware of the severity of his cancer while he was making this album as well. <br />Much of the lyrics on \\"Brainwashed\\" reflect a dialogue with death, and Harrison seems to be at peace. He asserts the importance of Buddhism and Eastern philosophy in his outlook on life (and death) when in \\"Looking for my Life\\" he sings, \\"I only found it out when I was down upon my knees...\\" <br />Now, it would be easy to look at this album through deifying goggles since this is Harrison's first posthumous release, but I am not going to be guilty of that disservice. While the spirituality of the album feels genuine and inspired, it falls apart in its attempt at social critique and in its overproduction.<br />Musically, the album suggests Harrison was more influenced by his tenure with the Traveling Wilburys than he was by the Beatles. If the album hadn't been labeled, I would swear to you that some of the tracks on here were written and performed by Tom Petty. <br />This is especially evident in the title track when Harrison lashes out against \\"school...teachers...rules...leaders...(and) the Dow Jones.\\" Harrison even takes the obligatory shot at the Catholic Church in \\"P2 Vatican Blues.\\" The social critique comes off as immature and poorly thought-out, despite any possible relevance. Basically, some of the tracks would feel at home on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' recent release, \\"The Last DJ.\\" Ick.<br />Some of the songs are very memorable; the opening track, \\"Any Road,\\" boasts a great sitar-y guitar hook. It leads into a catchy chorus that could be substituted for the chorusof Cat Stevens' \\"Changes IV\\" from \\"Teaser and the Firecat.\\" \\"Pisces Fish,\\" the third song, is at least as catchy. <br />Oddly enough, the strongest track on the album is the only song Harrison did not pen: \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.\\" It doesn't sound at all forced, which is the problem many of the songs on this album have for the aforementioned reasons.<br />I don't know how close to being finished Harrison considered this album. The over-polished feel suggests to me that production was an afterthought. The intense spirituality could have been enhanced with a more raw and personal production job. It's probably another case of record execs making bank on the death of an old rock hero. In that case, I am glad I got a promotional copy of the album for free.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie is about a car heist that goes awry. In the beginning we see a lot of action, and then it just builds up until the end of the movie, the climax.<br />This movie features awesome cars, stunts, and story. It's about a retired car thief (Nicholas Cage plays the guy-named Memphis in the movie) who must return to car stealing to save his brother's life. What ensues is perhaps the best car movie I have ever seen. It was downright exciting and fast paced.
B00003003R|5.0|The two cd set of live era 87-93, was started by \\"nightrain\\" which can always start a set, then at the end of \\"Mr. brownstone\\" the one minuet pause of axl trying to get the fans back from the stage and injuring the fans in the front has to be the one nice thing in axl's short-lived famous life.  the cd just goes on and finally goes out with an eleven minuet \\"november rain\\" the second cd is a little softer on the profanity than that of the first, but still can kick any butt any day, the seventh and eighth tracks consiting of \\"sweet child 'o mine\\" and \\"knocking on heavens door\\" gave me goosebumps when i heard them, in the end \\"paradise city\\" is the ultimate end to any single album, especially the way this one was.  This album proves with a nip here and a tuck there, and old girl can still look (or sound) good.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie charmed me enormously with her big wide eyes and her love of simple, innocent pleasures.  The story line is simplicity itself.  When Amelie, an introvert, reachs outside herself to bring happiness to another human being her whole world is changed, and in the end she finds the courage to be happy herself.   But, truthfully, it was the music that made me fall in love with this film.  Yann Tiersen has written a beautiful lyrical theme (La Valse d'Amelie) that is both haunting and whimsical--music that adds to the special effects, such as the bears on the lamp that become animated, and pull the light switch off when Amelie falls asleep.
0151008116|5.0|A real page-turner! A gripping and haunting story that forces the reader to rush to the end and leave wanting more.  Wade through the first 20-30 pages.  You'll be glad you did.
B00001ZWTS|4.0|This was the most enjoyable film I have ever seen. Not good. Enjoyable. <BR>I saw it recenetly on TV and I just sat there with a big grin from start to finish. It had style. OK, so it didn't make sense, but so what? I didn't expect it to be a faithful representation of 19th century life. It's just good fun: explosions, baddies, fun, and a huge giant evil metal spider, which counts for a lot in my book.<BR>This may not be everyone's thing, but if you don't want to be bogged down by useless extras like a plot, and get straight to the good stuff, Wild Wild West is for you.

Without a doubt the BEST Star Trek film.

0679735909|5.0|I put off buying this book for a long time after reading some of the unfavourable reviews it received on Amazon.com. (e.g. that the book is difficult to read, boring, overly long, dense, etc). But in January, I watched the 2002 movie adaptation (starring Gwyneth Paltrow) and immediately fell in love with the story. I knew then I just HAD to read the novel to experience fully the beauty of the story and its characters. I'm so glad I finally did, and would recommend this title if you're looking for a unique and engaging reading experience.    \\"Possession\\" is not exactly a light read, but once you get past the first 30 pages or so, you'll get the hang of Byatt's writing style and be fully drawn into the story. The novel opens with the introduction of the character Roland Mitchell, a young Brit graduate in mid-1980s London who works part-time at the British Museum assisting in research work on the famous (but fictional) Victorian poet, Randolph Henry Ash. Roland's a \\"penniless\\" bloke, but he's nice looking, hardworking and kind. One day as he's researching his work at the library, he discovers between the leaves of a reference book (which had once belonged to Ash), 2 letters in Ash's handwriting. They appear to be draft correspondence to an unnamed woman. Excited and intrigued, Roland pockets the letters and decides to investigate this secret life of Ash's (this is because based on the biographies written on him, Ash was supposed to be a happily married man). The significance is that if it's discovered now that he had led a \\"second life\\", the discovery would change the modern literary world's interpretation of Ash's poems.    Roland soon finds a vague link between Ash's letters and a 19th century reclusive poetess named Christabel La Motte. To find out more about La Motte, he enlists the help of Dr Maud Bailey (a La Motte scholar). Initially, Maud is reluctant to get involved in Roland's investigation as she doesn't believe there existed any romantic connection betweenthe 2 poets (what's more, La Motte was widely believed to be a lesbian). Roland finds it difficult to communicate with Maud because of her cold and distant behaviour towards him (like an \\"ice queen\\"). Maud is young, rich and beautiful with long blonde hair (which she hides under a scarf at all times - find out \\"why\\" from the book).    Their investigation takes them to various parts of England including La Motte's ancestral home (now home to the cranky Sir George Bailey). I like the scene in La Motte's bedroom (in Sir George's house), where everything in her room is left \\"preserved\\" and undisturbed after her death, including a series of dolls propped against a pillow. In this room, Maud and Roland ingeniously discover a bundle of love letters written by Ash and La Motte to each other. I think that the letters and excerpts from diaries should be read in full as they are important to the story. I also think it's alright to skip reading the longer and complex poems as it won't affect one's understanding of the story.    While intensely trailing the love affair of the 2 poets, Roland and Maud become \\"intoxicated\\" and infected by the \\"air of romance\\" in their investigation and start to draw close to each other. You must read how Roland finally melts and conquers the heart of the \\"ice queen\\". It's very romantic.    So this novel gives us two romances (from 2 different centuries) and a gripping \\"detective\\" story. What a treat! The Victorian love story is beautiful, passionate and has a compelling and unexpected ending. The contemporary romance is believable, moving and honest. I opine that roughly, the former takes up 40% of the book, the latter 30% and the remaining 30% consists of Victorian poems and excerpts from diaries.    I loved this book. I didn't find it a dull read at all! It sure deserves the Booker Prize it won in 1990. And oh, watch the movie too! Both are highly recommended!

B00005JLZL|3.0|Alan Parker, the director of \\"The Life of David Gale\\" (shouldn't this really have been called The Death of David Gale?), is a man who never met a political cause he didn't like. He's met prison life/drug enforcement in \\"Midnight Express\\" and civil and human rights in \\"Mississippi Burning.\\" Both of these films are fun, populist movies: entertaining but bland and exploitive.<br />In \\"David Gale, \\" Parker takes on the Death Penalty as embodied by David Gale (Kevin Spacey), a fervent death penalty activist who is on death row and who calls in a magazine reporter, Bitsey Bloom (a radiant Kate Winslet) to help clear his name in the four days prior to his execution.<br />There is a decidedly ugly anti-intellectual bias in this film and setting it at a University and populating it with educated, though nasty and poorly behaved people only gives Parker more ammunition to spew his bile. He is out to make a point here and instead of using subtlety he uses a chain saw.<br />Winslet, looking slim and beautiful and Laura Linney both do their best with what is given them. But Spacey has been playing a variation of this role for the last few years and it is becoming old and stale. Where is the back-stabbing, acerbic, underhanded, charming Spacey of years gone by? What he needs to do is to mix it up. Playing roles that always show him in a good light has now officially becoming boring.<br />\\"The Life of David Gale\\" could have been, at the very least an intriguing murder mystery but unfortunately, Parker has gone the easy route of exploitation and cheap thrills thereby produced a dull, flat film that has nothing new to say and nowhere to go but up.
B00006LIRI|4.0|the main complaint I have is that we don't need remixes when the original songs are so much more amazing.  That said, U2 remians a vital, complex band who perform some of the best written songs in rock today.  I would add that the Bsides are often better than some of the singles the band releases.
B000001ESN|5.0|Rush entered the 1980's with a fresh sound, the great Permanent Waves. The band had been neck-deep in all things prog for most of their short career up to that point, but they realized that to be truly progressive, one must move forward with the times. Music was changing, and Rush was smart enough to see that 'constant change is here to stay'. On this album, they manage to retain the elements of what Rush fans had come to expect : frenetic hard rock built around complex arrangements and polyrhythmic stops and starts, lightning fast playing, and lyrics that were a cut above your standard \\"I love you etc.\\" cliches. But the band also were becoming malleable enough to take new trends and styles and meld them into something totally unique, a quality that would define the group in years to come.<BR>Here, they have stripped away the cheesy concepts in favor of a more streamlined sound (for Rush anyway). Drummer Neil Peart, who also is the lyricist, was finding more accessible ways to present his philospohical musings to the group's hardcore fans. The album starts off with one of the great guitar riffs, played nimbly by guitarist Alex Lifeson. It was on this album that Lifeson had truly come into his own. The song talks of the importance of art and staying true to your ideals over making a buck, especially in the world of Top 40 radio.<BR>Next is the pseudo-spiritual rocker Freewill. The song features one of Lifeson's greatest solos, underpinned by amazing bass playing from singer Geddy Lee.<BR>While the band were abandoning their 20-minute concepts, they were still fond of lengthy cinematic flourishes, one of which is the powerful Jacob's Ladder. Peart's percussion work will leave you shaking your head. Lee's vocal delivery is emotional and singable, something Lee was not previously known for. But on Permanent Waves, he seems to be trying to sing more than scream, and his high-end wail is more restrained. <BR>Another singable tune is the ballad Different Strings, with lyrics from Lee.<BR>The album closes out with Natural Science, a 9-minute essay with more deep observations from Peart. The song starts with gentle water lapping around the speakers with acoustic guitar. Then, much like the ocean, the composition (you can't really call it a 'song' in the traditional sense) ebbs and flows in and out of fast and slow sections, and features not one but two solos from Lifeson. It ends with the sound of waves crashing on the beach, and as they fade out you recognize that this is a great album. Only 6 tracks, but those tracks feature intricate playing, composition and originality, and find Rush learning how to balance those things with accessability. Add clean, crisp production, a few synths here and there to add color and depth(provided by Lee) and a fun, pun-filled album cover (who says Rush can't be funny?) and you have a classic.

B000002U9W|5.0|&quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; is such an underrated album in the Pink Floyd catalogue. It was the best album they did since &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; and remains in my humble opinion, one of their best albums period Why I think this album is so great is that it has a bit of everything. From the epic instrumental &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;( featuring French horns, chilling choir voices, keyboards and sound effects) to the acoustic-folk &quot;If&quot; to the piano-driven &quot;Summer 68'&quot;(still one of my favorite Floyd songs) and the subtly spectacular &quot;Fat Old Sun.&quot; &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; remains one of my favorite Pink Floyd instrumental songs. I feel &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; aside from being so great, was an important album because it hinted the things that were to come of Floyd and distinguished them as a very serious band in music and that they could make it without Syd Barret.
0800141660|4.0|Let me say upfront, this is my least favourite Austen book. I found it slow, almost tedious and I had to force myself to finish it.  It lacks the sparkle of her other novels and I did not see at all what Eleanor saw in Edward in the book.  He was dull, dull, dull.<br />I found Emma Thompson's screenplay much more upbeat, witty and fun than the book and the casting helps as well.  Emma is spot-on as Eleanor, so proper and honorable.  Kate Winslet is the perfect Marianne - all emotion and passion running headlong before thought.  Greg Wise was absolutely yummy as Willoughby whose character got a bit kinder treatment from Ms Thompson than from Ms Austen.  And Alan Rickman was terrific as the lovelorn but stalwart Colonel Brandon.  Even Hugh Grant was welcome in the role of Edward (though I must say, I'm not a fan).<br />Also some great performances from the supporting cast:  Hugh Laurie was amusing as the snide Mr Palmer;  Harriett Walter as the snobbish and nasty Fanny;  Robert Hardy as the silly Sir John and Elizabeth Spriggs as the nosy Mrs. Jennings.<br />As I said before I enjoyed this treatment better than the book.<br />If you liked this, also try Persuasion starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root(not to mention the more obvious Pride and Prejudice and Emma).  Persuasion was, I believe, Ms Austen's last novel and it's definitely more contemplative and low-key in nature.  You may also want to investigate a short story by Suzanne Allain \\"Incognito\\" which is very much in the spirit of Austen and Wilde.  She's a promising new author who deserves a plug!
B00003CX5P|5.0|As a child I loved the original Star Wars trilogy, and George Lucas has managed to ignite that feeling in me again with The Phantom Menace.  Set in the time before the original trilogy, The Phantom Menace deals with the struggle of the planet Naboo and its elected Queen, Amidala (Natalie Portman), to keep the ruthless Trade Federation from taking over their planet.  She is assisted in this by Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his Padawan student, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), along with a member of the underwater race of Gungans who share Naboo with the ground-dwellers, Jar-Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), who is swept up in their fight against the Federation when he is saved by Qui-Gon during an attack by the Federation droid army.  It is also the story of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a child slave from the planet Tatooine who is brought before the Jedi Council on Coruscant when it is discovered that he might be the one who can bring balance to The Force, which is part of the Jedi philosophy.<br />One of the things that I liked most about The Phantom Menace is the supporting cast.  Ahmed Best was wonderfully funny as Jar-Jar Binks, the Gungan who unwittingly gets caught up in the quest of the Jedi and Queen Amidala, and I can't say more about Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker other than he was just perfect for the role.  Seeing Anthony Daniels as the pre-SW C-3PO was a delight--like Jar-Jar, he was very funny and helped to break up the tension in some of the scenes on Tatooine.  Pernilla August was a good choice for Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker, a woman who wanted to see her son fulfill his destiny, but who knew she had to let him go so he could do it.  I also liked Samuel L. Jackson as the enigmatic Jedi Mace Windu, and hearing Frank Oz as the voice of the wise but mysterious Yoda--well, he's always a delight.<br />My favorite supporting actor in Phantom Menace, however, is Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine, who is made Chancellor of the Galactic Senate when Queen Amidala calls for a vote of no confidence against Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) for his refusal to send immediate aid to Naboo (McDiarmid also plays Darth Sidious, who sends his Sith student, Darth Maul [Ray Park] after Amidala &amp; Company on Tatooine).  Although he appears to be a good guy, one can sense by how McDiarmid plays the role that Palpatine is a power-hungry despot who wants it all, thus setting the stage for his future persona as the Emperor.<br />The thing I like most about The Phantom Menace DVD release is the fact that it's a 2-disc set, with the movie and commentary on one disc and the extras on the other.  Having the extras on a second DVD leaves open the opportunity to include a lot, and believe me, there are loads of extras!  There is an hour-long documentary that takes you inside Lucasfilm and ILM during the making of The Phantom Menace as well as deleted scenes, a 12-part award-winning web documentary on the production of the film, the &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; video by John Williams (which I can't seem to get bored with, and I watched it plenty of times when I was working in a video store), teaser and theatrical trailers and TV spots, and much, much more.<br />All in all, I have to say that The Phantom Menace DVD set is worth owning.  Not only is the movie a good one guaranteed to keep you entertained for the full length of its running time, but the extras will keep you from getting bored as well.n Queen Amidala calls for a vote of no confidence against Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) for his refusal to send immediate aid to Naboo (McDiarmid also plays Darth Sidious, who sends his Sith student, Darth Maul [Ray Park] after Amidala &amp; Company on Tatooine).

B000000H7I|5.0|I've got to admit, I was surprised by this CD. It shocked me to see that this album was actually heavier than most of the stuff coming out now! The drums are not drowned out by the other instruments, and the vocals are like combining all other great singers of death metal into one. You can understand the vocals, too, so that's very good. the guitars are a different story. I was surprised also to hear elaborate solos in the songs, where you rarely hear any in other Death Metal albums, and the ones you usually hear are 2 seconds long. But, that's not true in this album. They dared to go farther than any death metal group had went before and done that by putting together a lineup fitting that of a number one group. It's surprising to me that this band's sounds have been mimicked so often by many other bands. And when you see a band taking ideas from another band, you know that they're only trying to be half as good as that band. The production has been criticized before, but I have no idea why. The production is great, and the sound is, well, awesome. I don't know why it had ever been criticized in the first place, i guess it's because it's not as loud as the newest Cradle Of Filth CD, or not as noisy as the newest Dimmu release, but I guess the critics forgot that this CD was made in 1991. There's another reason to like this CD: The fact that it is still being compared to CD's now is great, it only shows you how far ahead of their time these guys were. I gave this a high rating because of that very reason. This is the kind of music that leaves a lasting impression on you. For the Death Metal fan looking for a little bit of change, get this. For the Fan looking to get turned on to Death Metal, get this. Whatever your reason, I'd advise getting this, it may be one of the last few good CD's around.
B00005JLRR|5.0|despite the bad (and many stupid)comments about this film i found out after ignoring the spiteful and idiotic reveiws that star trek nemesis was a good all round action packed adventure movie with all the things that make star trek great. <br />star trek nemesis boldly gets better and better as the film goes on, the acting was brilliant, and altough many of the lead roles looked much older, it was great to see them once again on the bridge of the Enterprise-E fighting a truly awsome villan. <br />not as good as star trek first contact but much better than insurrection and one of the better films in 2002, star trek nemesis gets my vote of brlliance.<br />all thats left to say is, roll on number 11 and live long and prosper.
B00005JM1D|5.0|I am a big fan of Will Ferrel. He is a very talented actor and is also very funny. Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are also very talented actors. So you know the movie has talent, but does it have depth, well, not really. Does this movie have laughs, Oh yes! This is an enjoyable movie with very many laughs, an enjoyable cast, and a FUN story. Also, Juliette Lewis is a very good actress, and we are graced with a brief moment of Sean William Scott. I laughed the whole time Scott was on the screen.<br />Will Ferrel displays his best talent by just letting us watch him and laugh, no holding back. Wilson is the main character, and most responsible. Vaughn gives a whole different way to make us laugh, he's definately an original. The only thing that lacks in this movie is a sense of together-ness(is that a word?). Its basically fun for the sake of fun, and stupidity for the sake of stupidity, but none-the-less, it is absolutely hilarious and eye watering funny. So I would definately say, if you are in the mood for a comedy, and have a few extra bucks to spare, make an investment in Old School, you are sure to get your moneys worth.<BR>RATED R FOR SOME STRONG SEXUALITY, SOME NUDITY, AND LANGUAGE.
B000002UB6|4.0|Ever since it's release in 1970, \\"Let It Be\\" has always been the undervalued album of the Beatles' catalog (well, in some ways at least). It was the Fab Four's attempt to record an album of all-new material completely live, with no studio overdubs. But various problems throughout the project began to pull the band apart, such as the ever-present cameras filming every single second of the sessions for a documentary, and Paul McCartney, though certainly well-meaning, driving his bandmates to extremes with his complete control of the proceedings. In the end, the Beatles recorded a whole truckload of material, but were so soured by the experience that they couldn't bear facing the task of going through the tapes. So, it was up to legendary producer Phil \\"Wall Of Sound\\" Spector to cobble together an album from the troubled sessions. After the necessary tinkering with the tapes was completed, \\"Let It Be\\" finally surfaced in 1970, AFTER the Beatles' final proper studio album, 1969's \\"Abbey Road.\\"Listening to \\"Let It Be,\\" it's hard to believe that there were any problems going on, as the band certainly *sound* as if they're having a good time. Most of the tracks are just as great as anything else the Fab Four have done, such as the joy of John Lennon & Paul McCartney's duet on the whimsical \\"Two Of Us,\\" John's lovely \\"Across The Universe,\\" George Harrison's excellent little rocker \\"I Me Mine,\\" Paul's classic hymn-influenced title track, the wonderful exuberance of \\"I've Got A Feeling,\\" Harrison's charming blues number, \\"For You Blue,\\" Paul's beautiful ballad \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" and the band's legendary rooftop performance of the classic, \\"Get Back.\\" The joking tracks \\"Maggie Mae\\" & \\"Dig It\\" are both obvious filler, but they're still good fun. Drummer Ringo Starr sings no lead vocals at all this time around, which is disappointing, but his drumming throughout is tight (as always!), and guest-artist Billy Preston does some fancy fingerwork on the keyboards for some of the tracks.Many criticisms have been leveled at producer Phil Spector for \\"drowning\\" a few of the tunes with overdubs of horns, strings, and choir voices (and without the Beatles' consent, no less), most prominently on \\"Across The Universe,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" and \\"The Long And Winding Road.\\" Though I can certainly understand how the Beatles felt about Spector's overdubs, the dubs still don't take anything away from the greatness of the songs themselves, in my opinion. Furthermore, I applaud Spector for extending the running time on Harrison's \\"I Me Mine.\\" With a little splicing, Spector lengthened the song's running time from 1:34 to 2:24. It's still a short tune, but thanks to Spector, there's more of it to enjoy.Let's give the Beatles & Phil Spector some credit here. It doesn't matter to me how much mud the Beatles slung at each other during this time, as the lion's share of \\"Let It Be\\" is very brilliant, containing many classic songs. And if it wasn't for Phil Spector rising to the challenge of going through the tapes of these sessions, we wouldn't have had a \\"Let It Be\\" album at all, which would've been a tremendous loss. Their days may have been numbered by this time, but \\"Let It Be\\" proves that even arguing Beatles can still make great music together. :-)
0316666343|5.0|I rarely read anything other than murder mysteries... but the rave reviews of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" grabbed my interest... I read the first few pages at the bookstore and was hooked... Susie Salmon came to life in a way no other character ever has... at the end it started to get a little wierd... granted, the reader must suspend disbelief from the get-go, but Susie's last earthly visit seemed too far-fetched for me... but the last two pages of this wonderful book moved me so deeply... as soon as I finished reading, I closed the book and held it to my chest and wept for a few minutes... just a couple weeks ago, I saw the book at Costco... I touched the front cover as I fondly recalled those two days when Susie was part of my life... I picked up a copy and opened it to the second to the last page... there I was at Costco, crying in the book section...
B00005RHGK|2.0|But that isn't saying much. Let's see if this has all the necessary formulae for a dumb teenie scream fest. <br />1. Dumb teens on a roadtrip/camping trip. <br />Yes<br />2. Dumb teens see something \\"like totally weird\\" and risk their lives to investigate it as opposed to running away.<br />Yes<br />3. Female actress who can tear up on command and scream a lot.<br />Sort of. It's the guy who seems to do much of the screaming and wide-eyed looking in horror. I guess he knew the Creeper had his number. Oops, spoiler. ;-)<br />4. Gratuitous nudity.<br />No shower scenes for no reason, no spontaneous co-ed skinnydipping. What a pity. If that girl had showed her naughty bits, this film could have gotten another star. Because she's a cutie. <br />5. People getting trapped somewhere<br />Yes<br />6. Rubber-face bad guy who's identity and face is revealed too early.<br />Yes <br />7. Music score climbs to a crescendo just to let you know the baddie is about to strike (and ruining all sense of suspense)<br />Yes<br />8. Old man/lady who mysteriously knows everything about the evil that is blah blah blah<br />Yes<br />9. Dumb indifferent cops<br />Yes<br />Hmmmm. Yep. Jeepers Creepers is your typical teen slasher flick. But alright, I'll say something positive about the movie then. The song that plays over the opening credits is darn catchy. Hush! Hush! Here comes the boogieman. It's by Henry Hall!
B00006BIO0|5.0|Blues composer and performer, Sleepy John Estes claimed that you could hear Charley Patton's unamplified voice and guitar at a range of 500 yards. Estes may have exagerated a tad but think about the power of a voice you could hear even at the range of 100 yards. Charley Patton's recordings were made out of the cheapest available vinyl (used to make bowling balls) and were scratchy sounding even when they were released. Paramount felt that their &quot;race records&quot; didn't warrant high quality vinyl. One of my childhood preoccupations was listening to the Yahoo releases of Charley's material and trying to figure out what the guy was signing under the white noise buzz and pop of surface noise. Such a powerful voice and such awful recording technology. Now going on 80 years since their orginal releases, someone has finally made all of Charley's releases listenable. I could go on about Patton's widely imitated guitar playing, his dark allegorical lyrics, his consumate performing style or his carefully crafted image as a rebel, but you still will go back to that powerful voice. And now justice has been done to his awesome legacy of music... and justice has been done to the listener with the release of &quot;The Complete Recordings&quot; which offers this amazing 5 volume CD set at a price only slightly above the cost of a single CD. Maybe there is a Santa Claus, Virginia.
0743442539|4.0|Alec Leamas is not an easy man to have affection for, in the beginning, yet as the story builds I could not help but become his advocator.  I was reminded of the stoic character of Kurt Russell in the movie Soldiers and that became a good personality model for the character of Leamas.  He is a spy.  Of course, and a British spy to boot.  The year is 1960 and Berlin wall is high and thick.  To be called in from the \\"cold\\" is for a field operator (a spy) to be called back to the safety of the Home office.  In this case our paladin spends a good more time out than in from the cold.  True to de Carr the story is complex with seemingly dark corners and dead ends at every turn.  Written in 1963 when the Cold War was certainly at it's height there is a disturbing contrast between the value of the individual weighed against the good of the whole with a harsh look at both sides of the Wall.  Communism is presented as the enemy, certainly.  However about half way through the book it becomes clear that the good old boys back at the Circus in London just may be up to a bit of double crossing, at Leamas' expense.  And then there is the young Jewess, a Communist, back in London that he must protect, no matter the cost, to himself or his mission.  A most enjoyable read, right up to the very last paragraph.<BR>February 2003
B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo has been called the greatest Western ever.  I don't know about that, but I do know that this is a very good example of the Western genre.  John Wayne stars as the sheriff Chance, who is having problems with a local group of ruffians and who's deputies are poorly suited for the job.  Chance doesn't want the townspeople involved--they'll just get hurt. <br />Most of what can be said about this film already has been, so I'll just add that the chemistry between Wayne, Dean Martin, and Walter Brennan is very good (Brennan is the stereotypical funny-guy, downright hilarious).  All three of these men give spectacular performances, and Ricky Nelson shows up to add flavor to this group of lawmen as well.  Every fan of Westerns should see this movie at least once--chances are, most already have.  Regardless, Rio Bravo remains one of the classic examples of what a good Western should be.
0385508417|5.0|Being a long time fan of Grisham's novels, I delayed reading this short one.  I like long novels, big thick tomes that take a time investment.  Well, it may take less time to read Skipping Christmas than reading War and Peace, but it's certainly a lot funnier.  Skipping Christmas is the funniest book I've read since M.A.S.H.  I know more than one tax accountant and to keep from sounding discriminatory let me just say they don't have a reputation for being the most daring fellows around.  And, in the beginning, Luther Krank is just as straight-laced and routine driven as any accountant I've known.  That begins to change pretty rapidly when he convinces his wife Nora to go along with his rather questionable scheme to just forget Christmas this year.  There were moments when I had to quit reading so I could finish laughing, not just an amused chuckle, but a full blown heehaw.  One particular incident begins as I watch Luther climb on his roof.  I know he is in trouble, real trouble but I can't quit snickering.  It's gonna serve him right, the crawfish, it's gonna hurt and it's gonna serve him right.  This is a most enjoyable read that I will certainly re-read, and without the time investment of War and Peace.
B000002MG1|5.0|REM's Automatic For The People is an August masterpiece and definitely best listened to in the summer although it is still great all year round.Beautiful,slightly dark,individualistic and a celebration of independence just like summer itself it stands alone as a masterpiece for years to come.Try Not To Breathe is absolutely gorgeous while Nightswimming,Man On The Moon,Monty Got A Raw Deal, Everybody Hurts, Drive and The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight all turn this much appreciated album into a masterpiece.This is definitely a must own and one of the best albums of the summer.Period.
0451167716|5.0|Having seen the movie, how many times? certainly more than once, I am rather surprised that I am just now getting around to reading the novel.  And I am grateful that it has been a few years since I last viewed the film.  What the novel brings is the movie with a greater depth of character, a non-judgmental presentation of history and events that are both startling and endearing.  The character development of such as Luca Brasi is critical to the greater imagery of the time and the environment.  The medium of literature allows for details and insights that enhance our association, even our identification, to the odyssey.  I smile at Tom Hagen's sophistication and humility.  I cringe at Carlo's brutality and arrogance.  I am charmed and frustrated by Sonny from the beginning.  Puzo tells me of a world I have no exposure to and convinces me I am a participant.  I am not just watching an exciting adventure.  I am sitting at the table with Michael, Sollozzo and McCluskey.  I am watching Nino's death wish aware, as a recovered alcoholic, he really would rather die than face the pain of life.  And you know I keep a sharp eye out for Fabrizzo.  I am sure I will see him again and I'll have my revenge.  The only regret I have toward this novel is that it took me so long to come to it.  I will now read every thing Puso wrote knowing he is not just an icon, but a masterful storyteller as well.
B000060MMI|5.0|As a 39 year old headbanger, I was doing some research trying to find out what became of Dave King after he left one of my favorite early 80's bands FASTWAY. (Dave and Fast Eddie Clark ruled!) I stumbled onto Flogging Molly on All Music Guide and decided to give it a shot. WOW. Being older and not just a one dimensional metal head anymore, this cd opened up my ears to a whole differnt sound. The blend of Irish folk with punk rock is certainly new to me, but I love it! From the fast opener \\"Drunken Lullabies\\" to the somber closer, \\"Sun Never Shines\\", I was simply blown away; \\"Kilburn High Road\\" will be worn of my disc by tommorow, my absolute favorite! Dave and the band's writing is exceptional, the tales they tell interesting. And while I doubt Dave can belt out \\"Say What You Will\\" like he did in 1983, his voice can still reach the higher octives just fine. By all means get this one, you wont regret it.
B000002UEB|5.0|GREAT cd. I love the story, its really intriguing. I love the vocal bits in front of the songs, and Tate really does live up to the praise he gets. I'm fascinated by concept albums (Scenes from a Memory by Dream Theater is my favorite album of all time) this album is very good. Tate is phenomenal, and the instrumentalists (while they can't match DT's virtuosity) are good and still very fun to hear. If you like good rock, (TALENTED rock mind you, no Good Charlotte) and/or concept albums, this is for you.
0345363132|5.0|In the past I have been extremely critical of fiction when reading ficticious British history and usually take everything I read with a grain of salt. I was skeptical when I picked up this book, and it is without a doubt one of the best books I have a EVER read.<BR>I stayed up until 5 in the morning one night reading this book because I just couldn't stop reading! The War of the Roses, in the particular the strong women of this time (I'm writing my own series on these queens) has been a passion for years now. And yet I was almost crying when bad things happened to these charectars, partly because I knew what was going to happen, and partly because this book is so amazingly well written.<BR>  Penman is so phycologicaly in tune with Richard, Anne, Elizabeth, Edward, that you do fall in love with them. <BR>   I strongly reccomend this book. When I finished it I opened back up to page one and began again!<BR>   Penman has a die hard fan in me :)

B000059XXZ|5.0|Rich, but alone, without parents, with only one guide, young bilionare Bruce Wayne was forced to watch the brutal murder of his parents.  But after years of harsh training and discipline, Bruce returns to Gotham as the city's mysterious defender, know throughout the world as Batman, defending the helpless and vanquishing horrible villians.<br />This is the first movie in Warner Bros.'s \\"Batman\\" series, a collection of movies based on one of the world's famous comic book superheroes.  Directed by Tim Burton and starring Micheal Keaton, the movie is dark and mysterious, but it also contains action, adventure, and lovable comedy (you gotta love the Joker, played with delight by Oscar Winner Jack Nicholson).<br />In a world of despair, there came hope.  In a time of darkness, there came new light.  And in a time of evil, there came a powerful hero!  Made in 1989, it flows in the same style of early 90's movies, making it somewhat boring.  But if you're a fan of superhero movies, this one is for you.<br />Experience the mystery, the slendor, and the adventure, as you are transported into the mysterious world of Batman, where you meet him for the first time.  This is recommend to fan of comic books.
B00005JLSC|4.0|Another big budget musical following last year's Oscar Best Picture Nomincation - Moulin Rouge. This time Chicago got 13 nominations. While I have to say Chicago is brilliantly performed and directed, I prefer Moulin Rouge.<br />Zellwinger acts well as the wanna-be jazz singer, who killed her betrayed boy friend. She, however, is not one of my favorite hollywood stars. Zeta-Jones plays the role as a famous jazz singer, who also committed murdering her husband and sister - and went to the same prison as Zellwinger. Richard Gere, the money-hungry never-lose-a-case lawyer, is attorney for the two murderess.<br />All singing and dancing are done by these three leading roles, and are doing surprisingly well. Zeta-Jones obviously shows an excellent dancing talent. The puppet scene by Zellwinger and Gere are the best part of the movie.<br />Directing by Rob Marshall is excellent, though the movie lacks the sentimental feeling of Moulin Rouge (yeah, I agree it's a different story). And I think it's Martin Scorsese's turn to pick the Oscar Best Directing this year.  Wait and see.<br />Does Chicago derserve the Oscar Best Picture ? Your Pick......
0440237688|1.0|Her style of writing sounds childish and unformed, like a child whining when it feels bad. I thought this book would be similar in thought to 1984, or The Stranger, or maybe some of Herman Hesse's work, but it is not. This book is shameful mockery of literature.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Every song on this soundtrack is perfection.  I have listened to it many times, and I have also listened to the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack.  Both compare equally among the best in my musical collection.  I appreciate that the music goes a long with the scenes in the movies, so that you can kind of follow along and remember certain parts.  I am really looking forward to the Two Towers comming out on DVD (the extended editon, of course ;)).
B00005JKEC|1.0|The movie was just like many other cop files/buddy films.  Granted it can happen, but really, we have seen this all before. Greed takes over. We know cops don't make much, we know some have to find other ways. Been there, done that.<br />And yes, Denzel got the big award. But he did better work in some of his past films. Much better than this one. Like Glory, or Courage under fire. Or Devil in a Blue dress
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Ten minutes into viewing &quot;Moulon Rouge,&quot; I understood exactly why this is a movie that people either love or hate.  The strange juxtaposition of contemporary music with Paris of the 1890's, of garish sets and wild characters with a love story, can rattle even the most jaded viewer.  To like this movie, you have to enjoy the bizarre and be prepared for one of the most dizzying, sensory-assaulting films ever.<br />Ewan McGregor is convincing as the poverty-stricken writer who by accident lands a job writing a &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; for the Moulin Rouge.  When he falls in love with the sultry performer Satine (Nicole Kidman, in a fantastic performance), he must hide it from the manager of the Moulin Rouge, who has other plans for Satine.  In the meantime, Satine has her own secrets.  The plot explodes into a collage of slapstick, musical numbers, comedy of manners, neon lights, circus acts, and a Fellini-like surrealism.  The result can be mind-numbing but enormously rewarding for those who can stand it.<br />Obviously, this film is not for the conventionally-minded. If you don't feel like having your senses assaulted, pick another DVD.  However, if you are looking for a truly outrageous film, or if your tastes are off-beat and unpredictable, you may have found your movie.
B000068R1X|2.0|The 2002 remastered \\"Bark at the Moon\\" CD is actually more of a remix than a remaster.  Needless to say, a side by side comparison will show that the music itself (not just the tonal quality) sounds different from all previous releases of this album.  If you're a young fan who's brand new to Ozzy's music and thus have never really heard the \\"Bark at the Moon\\" album, you might like this somewhat modern-sounding remix.  Otherwise, if you're a long-time fan who knows the original album inside and out, you may be totally repulsed by the difference in the CD's music.    Ozzy re-re-released his first two solo albums on CD in 2002, but without any mention on the outside packaging that they were actually RE-RECORDINGS done with different musicians!  In an attempt to get out of paying royalties to the musicians who played on the original album, Ozzy had the original bass and drum tracks re-recorded by his current band mates.  (Quite an insulting way to treat the remaining band who not only made the late Randy Rhodes' a legend, but also helped bring Ozzy out of Black Sabbath's shadow -- if not reverse that situation entirely.)     The 2002 \\"Bark at the Moon\\" CD is essentially a remix of the 1983 original, not a re-recording.  But you'd have no way of knowing from reading the outside packaging or even the CD booklet.  In and of itself, the remixed album admittedly sounds rather good in places.  Although in a few other places it sounds like Ozzy's singing behind a wall (which is not an uncommon side effect found on badly produced metal albums).  Overall the CD music is very cohesive sounding, unlike what you get when you, oh say, try to re-record drums.  Here there's a little more boominess, different guitar and drum fills, more rhythm guitar and less keyboards.  It's now a somewhat modern-sounding metal album.    But is this what people expect when they buy a \\"remaster\\"?  For the long-time Ozzy fans: please be aware that this simply isn't the same \\"Bark at the Moon\\" you boughtin the 80s!  If, like me, you've become very familiar with \\"Bark at the Moon\\" after years of listening, then listening to the remixed album might come as a shock.  Not that it's been remixed as a dance album or anything extreme like that, but gone are all those little fills and solos your ears have come to learn.  The bell tolling at the start of \\"Center of Eternity\\" sounds like it's been shifted down an octave, like somebody throwing a rock at a pot of water.    If you still need a replacement for your scratchy vinyl or warbled cassette copy of \\"Bark At The Moon\\", try to get the 1995 remaster instead.  It will sound like what a remastered CD should sound like: just as you remembered it musically, but with superior audio quality.
0800141660|5.0|Emma Thompson's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel and Ang Lee's direction of it prove to be a stunning and talented combination.  This story about the complexities of love, society, and family won my heart in the first few minutes with its excellent acting, smart dialogue, and lush period setting.<br />The movie focuses primarily on the two oldest sisters of the Dashwood family - Elinor (Emma Thompson) and her younger sister Marianne (Kate Winslet.)  Elinor is practical and independent-minded, caught between her societal position as a woman and what she wants for herself.  In contrast, Marianne is impetuous, artistic, passionate; she pursues her emotions as though nothing else matters.  When both sisters fall in love with different men, they react very differently to the awakening of their affections.<br />The acting in this film could not have been any better.  Although critics have complained that Emma Thompson is too old for the part of Elinor, she at once dispels all doubts with her expert performance.  She becomes Elinor so thoroughly that it's difficult to imagine another actress tackling this role.  As the romantic Marianne, Kate Winslet is charmingly breathless; she captures the essence of her character with seemingly no effort. Hugh Grant is awkwardly sincere as Edward, and the normally sinister Alan Rickman portrays with heartbreaking honesty the love-struck Colonel. To bring all this talent together, Ang Lee provides nuanced direction that captures both the beauty and the humanity of Austen's novel.<br />On the surface, this is a quiet movie, but underneath the turmoil of life - whether in Austen's time or ours - simmers.  Viewers who enjoy character-driven films should love it.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|A while ago, like a long while ago I heard this song on the radio and I was instantly hooked on it, but I hadn't heard it sense.  Well, I heard it again on the radio one day and was instantly drawn in by it!  The song just so happened to be &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; by tATu.  So, I ran out (litterally ran) to the store and bought their album.  I listen to it while running, I tell all my friends about it, it's really just a great album! I love the remix of an old 80's song and I am absolutely crazy about how some of their songs are in English and Cyrrillic on the same album! (And it was nice of them to put the lyrics to all the songs in the cover as well.)  I enthusiasticly give this album two thumbs up because I love their new sound, the subject matter they sing about, and it's wonderful to take with you on a jog!

The acting is marvelous, the suspense is real, and the twist will blow you away.  Check it out for yourself.  Let the fine acting of Spacey, Winslet and Linney lure you into the theatre.  In the very least, you will be rewarded with great conversation on the way home.

B000002WUD|5.0|You will rarely get two people to agree about the merits of the music Elvis recorded in the seventies. Even if they agree about it being patchy, they will invariably disagree about which tracks are good and which are bad. In compiling this set, a clear attempt has been made to pick out the best, but it is inevitable that you (like me) will think that some tracks should have been excluded to make may for others that were omitted. In that context, this is a brilliant compilation.<br /><br />The first two CD's are filled with hit singles based on both British and American charts. This explains the inclusion of Green green grass of home, a minor British hit. The compilers didn't have to decide what to include - the public had decided on these tracks in the seventies via their purchases. Tracks that had been recorded in the sixties are to be found on the equivalent sixties boxed set. Even if it was the seventies when they became hits, you won't find them here. So these two CD's include all the seventies hits that Elvis actually recorded in the seventies, most notably The wonder of you, Its only love, Burning love, Always on my mind, Promised land, Trouble, Moody blue and Way down.<br /><br />The third and fourth CD's include studio highlights, while the final CD contains live highlights. It is the selection of songs here that is subjective, but I enjoy everything that has been included. There are tracks I would have liked included that weren't, but I solved that problem by buying CD's that had those tracks on. And therein lies the strength of this set - you get all the hits and a lot of other great music, but you don't have to buy all the rubbish to get them.

B00005CDNI|5.0|Some people associate Abba with disco music, but this album is as close as they got to recording a disco album (only some tracks fit that classification). It has several excellent songs but in its original form would only get four stars from me. The addition of two bonus tracks, Summer night city and Lovelight, brings it up to five stars.<br /><br />The British public, who normally bought Abba singles in quantities big enough to ensure number one in the charts, might appear to be (like me) less impressed with this album, as none of the singles reached number one although they were all top five. However, the album itself sold in huge quantities, so perhaps some people bought the album instead of the singles. In America, this album was less successful than its predecessor, but they visited America to promote that one (The album, featuring Take a chance on me).<br /><br />Summer night city was the earliest hit here. Released some months before the album, it appeared on several compilations but not on an original album until it was included on the re-mastered version of this album. The first single from the original album was Chiquitita, a song I didn't like at all originally, but I've grown to accept it because it's by Abba - it shows even they're not perfect. Only Blondie's Heart of glass prevented it being number one in Britain<br /><br />Much better is Does your mother know, in which one of the men (Bjorn) feature on lead vocals. The men started out as folk singers themselves. Their voices are nothing exceptional, but it is nice to hear them occasionally. This was followed by the double-A side Angel eyes / Voulez-vous. I prefer Angel eyes, but it seems that I am in a minority. In any case, the single reached number three, but Roxy Music also had a hit with a completely different song called Angel eyes and this may have caused confusion.<br /><br />For me, the outstanding song here is I have a dream - it even inspired American country-gospel singer to record a cover. This song, the last to be released from this album, was unlucky not to be a British number one - it was stuck at number two for ages behind Pink Floyd's Another brick in the wall.<br /><br />Apart from the singles, there were great album tracks, including The king has lost his crown, If it wasn't for the nights, Kisses of fire and the second bonus track, Lovelight, which was the B side of Chiquitita.<br /><br />I note that the track listing here includes Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie - on the CD's I've got, this was a bonus track on Super trouper instead. It was recorded midway between the two albums and was a British number three hit. Like Chiquitita, it is song I've come to accept but not one I regard as an Abba classic.<br /><br />While this is not one of my favorite Abba albums, there are a lot of brilliant songs here that are well up to the quality I expect of Abba (hence the five stars). Because of those songs, no self-respecting Abba fan should ignore it. You might even enjoy the songs that I think are merely OK.eased from this album, was unlucky not to be a British number one - it was stuck at number two for ages behind Pink Floyd's Another brick in the wall.

B00005QGAV|5.0|This marked the highest point is his career. hit after hit! some of the best performances ive ever seen anyone do. seeing him perform dangerous in korea had me hooked as a michael jackson fan forever. forget the tabloids the press the news, whatever! this is what really counted! one of the greatest performers of all time in my opinion. dangerous was leaking hits when it hit the shelves.  remember the time, jam, DANGEROUS. i capitalized that because its possibly his most creative performance ever both in song and on stage.  almost every single song was a hit.  a rarity these days, even for michael and his Invincible album.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's rock opera The Wall represents the beginning of creative rifts between bassist and leader Roger Waters and the rest of the band. From the very beginning, Waters was calling the shots for this album, writing the vast majority of the songwriting and lyrics, and handling most of the vocals. Waters' ego would eventually destroy the band. Richard Wright left the band right in the midst of The Wall, David Gilmour retained the Pink Floyd name after a harsh legal battle, and the band struggled on without Waters through two far-flung albums, neither of which matched their previous output.<br />However, unlike The Final Cut (which for all intents and purposes was a Waters solo album), The Wall benefits from some Gilmour involvement. His melodic lyrics on The Thin Ice, Mother, Goodbye Blue Sky, and Comfortably Numb make a welcome contrast against Waters' anguished and bitter voice and keep The Wall from being a one-sided affair. And of course who can forget Gilmour's transcendent guitar playing throughout? His mind-blowing solo on Comfortably Numb will go down as one of the great moments in rock history.<br />I feel that The Wall, despite its strong Waters bias, is perhaps their best album. Conceptually this album was the tightest Pink Floyd effort. The only true way to listen to The Wall is as an entire piece, not as singles. Musically, this album is very different from the post-psychedelia of Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, relying less on synthesizers and soundscapes and more on traditional rock instrumentation along with Michael Kamen's orchestration.<br />The Wall's story is embittered, angry, and disturbing, filled with Waters' trademark cynicism and political criticism (though not nearly as scathing as Waters' solo albums). The story of Pink's life and mental breakdown is compelling and frightening.  Waters was at his undisputed peak lyrically throughout, and despite the internal disputes the rest of the band is in prime form.<br />Highlights of this album: The blustery, aggressive opener of In The Flesh?, the legendary Another Brick In The Wall I-III, the sarcastic acoustic ballad Mother, the arena rocker Young Lust, the scary One Of My Turns, the eerie and dark Hey You, the absolutely amazing Comfortably Numb, and the driving melody of Run Like Hell. Pink's story comes to a decisive finish with The Trial and Outside The Wall.<br />If you are a musophile, you probably have this album already. If you don't it is absolutely imperative to add The Wall to your list of future purchases. It's a true experience, ranking right up there next to The Who's Quadraphenia as the best rock opera  and perhaps one of the Top 10 greatest rock albums ever.ights of this album: The blustery, aggressive opener of In The Flesh?, the legendary Another Brick In The Wall I-III, the sarcastic acoustic ballad Mother, the arena rocker Young Lust, the scary One Of My Turns, the eerie and dark Hey You, the absolutely amazing Comfortably Numb, and the driving melody of Run Like Hell.

B00007JVBI|5.0|This album is nearly perfect.  By far the best Cat Power album...haunting, emotional, beautiful and stunning.  Chan Marshall just keeps getting better and better.  <BR>Highlights, \\"Good Woman\\" and \\"Half of You\\" are brilliant.  The whole album flows like fine wine under a cool moonlite sky.  Stars shoot across with shimmering beauty while Chan strums and pulls at your heartstrings. What an accomplishment this album is!<br />Best album of 2003 thus far!
B00007JVBI|3.0|Think Breeders. As in, if you're going to take half a decade (or more) to release a record, it had better be a progression. The first three songs on You Are Free are stunning - as is the almost rocking \\"He War,\\" which could have fit snugly on What Would the Community Think\\" - but midway through, it all starts to sound the same. Chan Marshall steals Leonard Cohen's trick from \\"Joan of Arc\\" (two simultaneous voices - one sings, one talks) and sorta runs it into the ground. An exception to the late-album slump is \\"Names,\\" a touching, simple song about young 'uns acting the fool (selling drugs, having sex, etc). Certainly not a bad record by any means, but not exactly worth the wait, either.
B0000025H6|2.0|There are 3 or four really good songs here, &quot;young lust&quot;, &quot;hey you&quot;, &quot;comfortably numb&quot;, &amp; &quot;run like hell&quot;.  With a total of 26 tracks and only a few good songs, I don't see how this can be considered a classic &quot;album&quot;.  As an album, it's mostly filler, rambling on and on.  <BR>    I guess this was intended as a concept album or a rock opera.  Either way, I really can't find out what the 'plot' for the album is.  I guess it's suppossed to be Orwellian, about totalitarianism.  But is doesn't show that too clearly.<BR>And, how many *hours* does this album run on for?  17?  I really don't see how anyone could sit through this entire album in a single listening.  It's way too long, and very boring.<BR>    I find Pink Floyd overrated.  They have a huge cult following, and there music isn't even good.  I guess you have to be stoned to enjoy it.  <BR>    The lyrics are confusing and dull to me, and the music is very slow paced.  If a group wants to make a concept album, I think they should avoid adding so many filler tracks, that is, the one and two minute blurbs that they put it to help define the story.  This album has too many of those fillers.<BR>    I kinda used to like Floyd, though now I can't understand why.  I know they wanted to be artistic and progressive, but to me they're boring and pretentious.   I've only heard 3 Floyd albums, 'dark side', 'wish you...', and 'wall'.  They all are long and boring.  Frankly, the only good songs I've ever heard by Floyd get played on the radio, so I don't see why'd I should want to own their albums.
0156012197|2.0|I bought this book, my favorite book of all time when translated from the original, thinking that it was going to be consistent with that translation from Katherine Woods.  Her verbiage was distinct and beautiful and romantic and filled with magic.  She had a gift, a power over language, a gift that tore into you and made you cry.  I bought this copy, translated by Richard Howard, to mail to my fiance so that he could understand a bit better, me...  This translation is completely the opposite of what I want him to see in me.  It contains none of the beauty from the original translation.  He has changed the words, the phrases, as if he was simply looking at a Thesaurus, to find similarities, and take the credit for \\"translating\\".  I have thrown this in the trash, and am grateful that I looked at it first before impressing it upon my fiance.  I could not be more disappointed, and I have learned a lesson in carefully researching the choices / the authors / the translators presented on Amazon.
B00005M91K|5.0|The film delivers its message without the aid of words, relying on compelling cinematography and a moving score. The film is at times haunting and at others inspiring. It conveys in the most powerful of ways the overwhelming richness and depth present on perhaps one of the greatest canvases of all time, Earth. The powerful imagery and sounds give you a perspective on life perhaps only matched by the Qatsi trilogy. It will leave you still and in deep thought about your own place in the world and that of life as a whole.<br />The back cover sums it up best, however. &quot;Mere words do not do the film justice - Baraka must be seen, felt and experienced to be understood.&quot;
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Once again Iron Maiden show the rest how it's done.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I'm concise. This movie confronts our species in ways that few of our members do. Questions and confrontations abound. Frankly, either the homo sapiens who hated this movie didn't \\"get it,\\" or human experience has been conditioned to be subconsciously adverse to such movies-- various institutions do a great job of this. Go ahead and watch or own this movie. Small-scale evolution and increased consciousness are not out of reach. We certainly are THE ridiculous species, the one that has advanced beyond the point of seeing itself for what it really is.
6304696515|5.0|This movie has just entered itself into my list of the few movies that i call my favourites. The onscreen passion and sexual tension is electric. Casting couldnt have been more appropriate and John Malcovich is supurb! If you liked Cruel Intensions and have never seen this-it is a must. It houses the same satirical humour and witty script and is good value entertainment
B00006F7S4|5.0|When I first listened to this album, my heart felt heavy. In one of the few times in music history, a musician has translated human emotion into music, and I respect and appreciate Beck for that. The album may be depressing to some, but that adds to its significance: there is more to feel and discover about unhappiness than happiness. After all, happinesss is the clinical absence of all that makes one unhapppy. When I listen to this album, I feel that I am not alone in human suffering. That quality amongst others makes this album one of my favorites that deals with human experience. For me, this album definitely transcends music listening.<br />Sidenote: I thought this album would automatically win the Grammy for Album of the Year along with nominations in the same category for Wilco's &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; and Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot; Boy, was I wrong. Nonetheless, I think that the owner of any one of these albums would love the others. Hope this helps. Continue to enjoy music.
6305127638|5.0|i was fascinated by this movie!  i loved how they showed how star trek actually began!  the graphics in this movie was flashy and bright.  they added humor to this and they pulled it off.
B000006OBQ|5.0|There is a quote from Dean Martin to the effect &quot;It's Frank's world, we're just lucky to be living in it.&quot;  This CD does more to prove that statement than anything else I have heard from Sinatra. He obviously is extremely comfortable on the stage. Maybe too comfortable- some of the monologues between songs are a bit outdated. But the music! Sound quality on this CD is magnificent! Obviously re-mastered by the best of the best, from superb quality original tapes. Frank's singing exhibits every quality on this CD that he is justly famous for. Emotion, phrasing, tonal quality all masterful.  Song choices are just great, a really representative range of Sinatra standards. And Basie's backup is of course lively and just beautiful. All in all, one of my favorite Sinatra CDs. It may become one of your favorties also, IF you can forgive the monologues...
0151006903|3.0|I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed by this novel and I say this after having read all of Eco's other novels over the years.  The sub plot with the Hepatia kept me interested for awhile, but the central device of having Baudolino narrate his entire story while under siege in Istanbul didn't hold up.  It's as if Eco needs lots of complicated narrative devices when sometimes they actually interfere with the telling of the story.  Not that the novel isn't extremely clever, historically accurate (although I'm hardly a scholar of that period) and captivating in parts with its erudition, but sometimes it felt like knowledge more to show off than for its own sake.  Parts of the middle of the novel are actually downright boring and with the whole murder plot, the novel turns into a bit of a shaggy dog story.  Devout Eco fans should give it a try and will enjoy many parts, but as a whole, it's slow, a bit tedious in parts and overly pedantic. It's one of those novels you'll be glad you read, but it may not seem so until you've plowed through it.
B00005JLXC|1.0|I repeat, Do not see this movie.  It will be two excruciating  hours you will never get back.  Why, you ask?  Well, it could be the painfully staged fight scenes.  Or the badly delivered lines.  It could be the lack of interesting story line.  Or the fact that by the time you got to the end of the movie it left you wondering- What exactly was the point?  In conclusion, It isn't worth your money or time to see this trash.
B00005YU1O|3.0|The animation is great but this movie put me to sleep 15 minutes into it. Basically the movie revolves around a guy who walks around running into people who then begin to lecture him about life, reality, and dreams. Not a terrible movie but a lot patience (and caffiene) may be needed.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I love Slipknot. My best friend played the c.d. Iowa for me one day and I loved it. I bought this c.d first though because I hadn't heard it. I loved it from the moment it first poped in my c.d. player to now as I write this review. This is my favorite Slipknot album If you like metal/hard rock buy this c.d.
B000002LUB|5.0|First, let me tell you that I've loved almost every Sabbath album out there (I didn't care for \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" or \\"The Eternal Idol\\" much, but I wouldn't say I hated them...). But my faves have always included the Dio-era albums. Ronnie can just belt out the vocals better, and I've always been a huge fan of Dio's lyrics. I'm not saying I'm not a fan of Ozzy's work (My opinion was that with Sabbath & Ozzy not together, we had TWO killer bands instead of one, and who could argue with that?) as I have most of Oz's albums. But Dehumanizer is arguably one of the best Sab discs in their whole catalog. \\"I\\" is a classic metal anthem, complete with sing-along lyrics (and tons of devil horns \m/). Both versions of \\"Time Machine\\" need to be played at high volume, preferably in a fast-moving vehicle... \\"Sins of The Father\\" and \\"Computer God\\" sound like Dio stole our 70's Sabbath. Slow, doomy, and killer. \\"TV Crimes\\" is a great track, tho most bands did the whole Televangelist thing back in the late 80's & early 90's, so for me, lyrically, it sounded a tad cliche (though it kicks tons...). <br />My only complaint about this album is that the Dio reunion lasted only one album... Think of what Sabbath could have been in the mid 90's with Dio at the helm...
B00005YW4H|4.0|Seldom in today's image driven world of music have I been more compelled to buy a CD than this one.  I can't think of a new artist that compares to Norah Jones, not because of the comparisons to past female singers but because of the many things she does that give an artist credibility in my humble book.  She sings, plays piano and is accompanied by a cast of excellent musicians.  Musicians, and that is a word tossed around too liberally these days.  Straight and simple, no B.S. just music.  Too few artists can demonstrate that ability today.  If this is the only success she has than so be it, enjoy what has been given to you, settle down, enjoy a glass of wine and relax....
6301620208|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO SCARY!!! THE FIRST PART IS SO BORING BUT WHEN RUSSIA DROPS THE MISSLE WE JUST DONT REACT WITH ENOUGH TIME AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOSE THIER LIVES. I HOPE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS TO US . OTHER THAN THAT ITS A GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH AND BUY.
6304057709|5.0|For once, the movie is better than the book. Blasphemy for some of you, but truly, Emma Thompson's screenplay is so well-written, you could sit down and read it -- with a cup of tea, of course -- and thoroughly enjoy every line. The sense of place, the musical score, the performances, and the warm humor make this a film to savor. Which I do, over and over again. I think I've seen it 30 times. Really. Whenever I'm asked, &quot;What's your favorite movie,&quot; Sense &amp; Sensibility is the first to come to mind.
0790729725|5.0|Zero stars for the appallingly bad DVD (double sided????  I didn't even know such a thing existed until now).  Others have covered this already, so I won't belabor the fact that the first side stops in the middle of the movie, never mind in the middle of a word, and you have to flip the disc to see the rest of the best gangster movie ever made (and I include the Godfather in that comment).  Unforgivable.<br />Five stars + for the film.  Stellar performances throughout.  Although the great Robert De Niro is given top billing, it's really Ray Liotta who's the star, and I don't think he ever received the recognition he deserved for this terrific performance.  Joe Pesci earned a well deserved Oscar for his part, Paul Sorvino is quietly terrifying as the local boss, and Lorraine Bracco comes very close to stealing the whole bowl of spaghetti from all of them.  Keep an eye out for another Sopranos actor:  Michael Imperioli plays a young wiseguy wannabe.<br />It's interesting to compare Scorsese's Goodfellas to his later and much inferior Casino.  Even with the same screenwriter and several of the same cast, Casino can't begin to match the energy and inventiveness of the earlier film.<br />Let's hope somebody decides to give Goodfellas the kind of first class treatment it deserves.
B000002JS6|5.0|well, not exactly their last, because the followup to BACK IN BLACK, FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, is also a marvellous album.<br />As for BACK IN BLACK, nothing more can be said. It's rock at its best ever.<br />The trouble is that Brian Johnson simply could not keep singing using that scratchy tone of his forever and, in a few years, his voice was completely wasted, and you would never hear him singing again with that crispness, raw power and energy of BACK IN BLACK, and FOR THOSE ABOT TO ROCK. Of coouse, when playing live, the vibe of the concert will amke you forget abou that. But jsut lsiten to BALLBREAKER and STIFF UPPER LIP to see what I mean...
B00006CXSS|5.0|Superb technically and emotionally!<br />Just like all the other reviewers, I found it wonderful.  The language was a little ripe to my ears but probably realistic ( one of the heroes, Winters, didn't swear or drink ).  I have watched it 3 times now with my 15 year old son.  I want him to appreciate what others have done to secure freedom - to appreciate that the true measure of manhood is the willingness to sacrifice for others.<br />Rachel's Dad

B000066NW0|5.0|I bought Avril's cd before any of her songs were on tv and I instantly fell for her. She is awesome and she IS different than everyone. You don't see her wearing those trashy clothes like Britney or Chirstina. She's her own person and no one else. I highly reccomend this cd to those who like ... good music. None of her songs are remakes and she's not a fake. She's awesome!

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Truley one of the finest recordings I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. If the new artist today would put a third of the heart that Mr cash puts into his music--the world would be full of angels. The honesty that was put into these songs reflect the depth and heart of the man who picked them and sang them. Great job!
B00004T9UF|5.0|\\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" is without a doubt Eminem's most shocking and disturbing album ever.  You can see him grow and mature as an artist with each album.  His second album not only surpasses the first one, it knocks it clear out of orbit!  Just when I thought he couldn't possibly get any more disturbing than he was on \\"The Slim Shady LP,\\" he surprised me yet again.<br />Be warned, this isn't for anyone who cannot stand offensive lyrics and disturbing content.  This is Eminem's darkest and most vicious album, and he does not hold his mouth back for a second.  As disturbing as his songs can get, he still is able to craft them magnificently.  It isn't just an album filled with non-stop profanities or obscurity, there's actually a structure and a plan to it all.<br />As good as this album is, the only small problem I have with it is that it seems more shocking than honest.  If you've heard his newer album, then you'll know what I mean.  While he is very lyrically honest at times, it just seems like he says things specifically for shock value.  The greatness behind \\"The Eminem show\\" was that the shocking and honesty was very well balanced.  Still, this is an outstanding second album that still impresses me today.<br />I like very song on the album, but my favorites are \\"kill you,\\" \\"stan,\\" \\"I'm back,\\" \\"marshall mathers,\\" \\"the way I am,\\" \\"kim,\\" \\"criminal,\\" and \\"the real slim shady.\\"  They're really all very good and there's not one song I dislike at all.<br />Eminem's \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" is a dark and relentless album that will shock and impress many.  Again, this is not for anyone who does not like offensive lyrics.  Just keep in mind most of his songs are said in jest or are the \\"heat-of-the-moment\\" feelings, which leads to the songs sounding intense.  If you are an Eminem fan and have not checked out this album yet, this is something you should think about the next time you want to get a great CD.  Eminem just keeps improving more and more as an artist.  Each album gets better and better.album gets better and better.
0440237688|5.0|I first read this book in the 7th grade. I liked the world that Jonas lived in. It was completely blank of all colors and feelings, life was absent there. Then when things started changing in the story, when Jonas met the Giver life came back into his world. <BR>This book is beautifully written with imagery and originality.<BR>Ms. Lowry did a fine job with her novel.<BR>I reccomend this book to anyone.
B00004Z459|5.0|I Love this CD, I can't get enough of Linkin Park. This Cd really shows their skils a individual and as band. It's the  kind CD, that you can listen to over and over again, and still love it. They got great beats, and Mike Shinoda [Emcee] does a great job rapping. Chester Bennington has a wonderful voice, its nice to see someone who can actually sing. All the songs are wonderfully wriiten, anyone can relate to the topics.
6305648522|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is an exhilarating film that does its best to squeeze every drop of emotion out of its audience. I know it is trendy to dismiss it as sentimental pap (as London's Time Out magazine did, I think)... Cinema Paradiso is a damn fine film that never outstays its welcome in my collection. <br />Tornatore's Felliniesque tale is set in the Sicilian village of Giancaldo, actually the director's home town of Bagheria, and begins as the young, fatherless Salvatore befriends the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo. Salvatore's coming-of-age is the occasion for a poignant portrayal of the coming-of-age of an entire city and, ultimately, a nation. The backdrop for this charming and involving piece of storytelling is the cinema. For Salvatore, film is a lens through which he interprets life, something with which film-lovers will identify.<br />The film is full of memorable images and symbols, many of which appear early on and are later hauntingly brought back into play. Bringing the film to life is Ennio Morricone's beautifully rustic score. Philippe Noiret and Jacques Perrin both turn in affecting Performances. <br />Anyone who has ever loved the cinema, and has ever felt what it is like to let go of memories, will find Cinema Paradiso mesmerizing.
B00004WLXZ|4.0|This is a fascinating film - a rare chance to see the Nazi Party through their eyes. Sometimes the film drags and is boring with such things as endless miles of parading Nazis and long-winded speeches, etc, but overall, this film will fascinate anyone interested in history.<BR>In some ways I think these guys are brilliant and in other ways, I think they're just bizarre (the Nazi Party leaders). Their obsession with creating pseudo-traditionalism is just weird to me, I just don't \\"get it\\". To tear down old religeons and customs to fabricate new phony made-up ones just seems silly to me. These were some strange birds, no doubt, and this film exposes a lot of that strange mentality going-on behind the scenes in that party.<BR>It's a good film and a great DVD with a wonderful commentary soundtrack, which makes watching this film like sitting through a home movie. The narrator explains what you are looking at wonderfully - this guy knows his stuff and unless you're an expert, you'll learn a lot watching this film with the commentary on. Get this DVD, its a great historical piece and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This group is just amazing. If you like pop music this if for you. Its a refreshing change from Britney and NSync. So emotional and raw.Excellent melodies and beats. The lyrics get stuck in your head. So much a Russian atmosphere to it. The stand out track is the lead single of &quot;All The Things She Said&quot;but also standout is &quot;How Soon Is Now&quot;,and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;. Dont pass up this record. Its well worth the listen. Its a sorely missed slice of music missed in the American pop scene today.
B00005JLSC|3.0|In the movie CHICAGO, there is a scene where Richard Gere's character illustrates to his client how much a court room is like a circus; all you have to do is razzle dazzle them and you'll win your case. That's what CHICAGO has done with many of the critics and the Hollywood establishment; put on a great show to hide a movie that's really only so-so. ...<br />Seeing that this is a musical, the acting is top-notch because it also involves a ton of singing and dancing as well. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are getting a lot of press, but the real stars of the show are the two major male performers: Richard Gere and John C. Reilly. Gere has a solo tap dance number that is most impressive. Reilly plays the only character who is likeable and normal and his solo song \\"Cellophane Man\\" is a performance of classic showmanship.<br />The film's story cuts back and forth from reality to fantasy, making the movie difficult to follow at first. Overall the only parts of the film that I was impressed by were the first ten minutes and the last thirty minutes The hour and twenty minutes in between is rather forgettable. The film has a PG-13 rating, but actually borders on R territory; there are a lot of scenes of violence and almost all the women are so scantily clothed it looks like they are wearing thin strips of toilet paper over their most private areas.<br />I admit that the film had me wanting Roxie Hart to be proven innocent. However, in doing so, I lost respect for the movie. I've routed for the criminal before (e.g. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN), but the criminals were always likeable people who made a change of character. In CHICAGO, all of the characters (John C. Reilly's Mr. Hart withstanding) are despicable crooks. They are sleazy liars who wallow in a hedonistic lifestyle at the expense of the joy and peace of others. I left the movie somewhat depressed, feeling I had just witnessed and partaken in a movement of propaganda. I was taken in by the old razzle dazzle. My advice to others, wait until the video and DVD comes out and the buzz has died down;...CHICAGO is only so-so.dvice to others, wait until the video and DVD comes out and the buzz has died down;...CHICAGO is only so-so.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|t.A.T.u's album '200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane is a great addition to the music world. Lena and Julia have very unique voices that are refreshing. With the current single 'All The Things She Said' they have so that they are planning to stay around and with other songs like 'Show Me Love' and '30 Minutes' they have made a great album. This album is also has lyrical creativity, and great dance beats. All in all its a well put together album.
B000000OQF|5.0|\\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is simply the best hard rock album ever made. It's cover art, catchy tunes, and uncompromising swagger put it a shot above anything by Black Sabbath or AC/DC. Every tune is a killer. The opening track, \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" might be the best metal classic ever released. \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" shows off lead singer Axl Rose's ability to sing baritone and then turn on the squealing, throat-wrenching wail that put him on metalheads' walls everywhere from 1987-1993. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" is as sweet and radio friendly as any Poison ballad, yet still encourages the listener to take the song and Guns N' Roses seriously. \\"Nightrain\\" blows off more steam than the B&O. In short, \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is the best offering ever sold in the Heavy Metal department. It burns blue hot, yet remains catchy and ultra-appealing.
B00004U8JV|1.0|Unfortunately, the typical American movie goer doesn't know a thing about rhinoceros hunting; so it's not really their fault they don't know: guns can't kill dinosaurs; but the production team for this movie should have known or at least should have consulted a rhinoceros hunter; if they did they would have known: the rhinoceros has a thick skin, a dense bone structure, an incredible hulk; and it is still much smaller and frailer than a T-rex and many other dinosaurs; but even a rhinoceros hunter has to buy a gun way bigger than anybody in Jurassic Park had; and even that gun is so weak there's only a tiny little area the size of a quarter where the gun is able to actually able to bring down the rhinoceros; anything outside that area will either just plain bounce off the rhinoceros or it will penetrate enough to give him a slight irritation enough to make him mad enough to maybe: turn on the rhinoceros hunter and charge (Hope the poor hunter can run!) Now dinosaurs:  Dinosaurs like the T-rex are much thicker skinned than the rhinoceros, much denser boned, and much heavier. Anything those guys in Jurassic Park fired would have bounced right off them. There are some weapons like hand grenades, missals, tank, and mounted guns that could bring down a T-rex. (Are you seeing how much potential for flash, bang, and explosion was lost?) Next thing I must complain about is first they seriously over rated guns then they completely underrated the intelligence of professional gun men! Just about every single attempt to fire a gun ended in a malfunction due to bad hardware or tampered with hardware. That is just stupid. A real gunman doesn't walk into a T-rex without checking his gun! No, this movie is just living proof that you don't have to have a brain to thought of as a genius. I really hope somebody goes back and completely remakes a similar story line. (And don't get me started on Reign of Fire!)
0440213525|5.0|The Client was absolutely the best John Grisham book I've read so far. I've read the Firm (Which was great), the Street Lawyer (Which wasn't any good), and now the Client. The Client was by far the best of the three. I am already on my fourth Grisham book A Time to Kill, and I plan on reading every one of his. <br />      There were so many things about this book that made it so good. Normally in a book, it takes a couple chapters for me to get interested. But by the second page in this one, I was hooked. Grisham has a way of holding your attention even if something suspenseful is not going on. That's what makes his books so good. They might be long, but they keep you interested for every single page. <br />      The Client starts out with Mark Sway, age 11, and his brother Ricky witnessing a horrible suicide of a lawyer (Romey) defending the Mob. The lawyer's client was mobster Barry Muldanno, who murdered Senator Boyd Boyette, and buried it somewhere that only he and Romey knew where. But before Romey kills himself, Mark is forced into the car by Romey and Romey tells Mark exactly where the body of Senator Boyd Boyette was buried. If the Feds find the body, they can convict Muldanno, but until then they can't. So Mark knows this information, and the FBi knows that he knows. Mark knows that if he tells, the Mafia will kill him, but that he if he doesn't tell, the FBI will convict him of obstruction of Justice, which is not telling what you know about a crime. So Mark hires a lawyer, Reggie Love to defend him, and that is where all the action starts.<br />      I thought that the Reggie Love was a good character. I liked how Grisham described her, and how she was a hard-... to the FBI, but not at all like that to Mark. The relationship between Mark and Reggie in this book is great. <br />      I also thought that Mark's character was great. All throughout the book, you feel sorry for him, that he had to witness that death, and that he can't just be a normal kid likeeveryone else his own age. But he handles it so good. He keeps his cool all throughout and is very clever for his age. What he does throughout the book makes you wonder that if you were in that same situation, if you could think, and act as quickly, and as clever as he did. <br />      I would definitely recommend this book to anybody. For anyone who wants to read a good thriller, this is the book to read. I am going to read it again soon, and am sure that I will enjoy it just as much as the first time.
B000002HPV|5.0|...This mindblowing work of Genius??<BR>It's hard to play favourites to begin with, if you're talking about Bjrk, but this album...is definitely another true classic of the ages. In the space of ten songs and 49 minutes, it manages to defy gravity, sadness, anger, joy, courage...and end on a note of the most supreme, angelic peace; the simple message &quot;all is full of love&quot;.<BR>And through it all, it is emotional, powerful, addicting, and completely gorgeous...I mean all that I say in this review. It is not mere girlish fancies taking shape in the form of over-exhuberant writing. ;^)<BR>The opening song, Hunter is a determined, military-snare-drum/accordian filled declaration of freedom and self-sufficience, equivilent to army of me as an opener to &quot;post&quot;...the second song, Jga is about Bjrk's best friend, but is so eloquently crafted and with such moving instrumentation and lyrics, that it can describe any love between any people and fill all with tears...the third song, Unravel, comes as one of her haunting &quot;interlude&quot; songs before something bigger...it's gorgeous, like a serious procession with an organ, but dripping with longing and emotions...<BR>Then...one of the albums climaxes, &quot;Bachelorette&quot; creeps in, and sweeps you away with its dramatic orchestration, beats, lyrics, and powerful vocals...followed by the midtempo, yet pulsingly cool beats of &quot;All Neon Like&quot;, with its intriguing lyrics about healing.<BR>After this, we get a short yet insightful song called &quot;immature&quot; about some of Bjrk's own experiences from her recent bad times which inspired her to make this album so powerful and dramatic. After this song, comes one of the light spots on the album, &quot;alarm call&quot;, previously called &quot;joy&quot;, which would have described it equally well, because, it acknowledges the annoyances in the world which hold us down, but never succumbs, and indulges in the joy of helping others.<BR>Then...the song Pluto crunches and pulsates in with its techno~punk, frantic, beautifully chaotic atmosphere and on-the-edge lyrics;--this song represents to Bjrk the part of the album where an icelandic myth of the gods destroying and re-creating the universe comes into play...and in the aftermath of this glorious earthquake...the album ends on a poigant...unbelievabley...mindblowingly...true and inspiring note with &quot;all is full of love&quot;. the message of this song is exactly as the title says. there is love and beauty in everything if we only look for it, and it says what so many songs in the world have failed to show.<BR>I was truly breathless after this song, which is the end of this album, and the heralding song for her next full-length album &quot;vespertine&quot;, and so will you be if you buy and experience this indescribable musical bliss.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Throughout the 70s, Stevie defined the meaning of artistry, expanding his sound with every new album.  Songs in the Key of Life is the greatest statement of his eclecticism.  Here, Stevie deal with so many styles of music that it's mind-blowing.  Every song takes off in a new direction, yet the whole album flows so well.  Many of his jams push into the 6 and 7 minute zone, but you never lose interest (&quot;As&quot; and &quot;Anoher Star&quot; being the best examples).  The shorter songs are brilliant as well, with Stevie's infectious joy (&quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;, &quot;I Wish&quot;) and passionate voice (&quot;Pastime Paradise&quot;) backing up superb music and lyrics.  I would say this is his best album, but I think Innervisions is even better.

B00006RU5B|5.0|It's rare these days when a band's CD is good from beginning to end, but Audioslave achieves this easily. There is plenty of hard driving rock on here, but there is also enough diversity to keep it from sounding one-dimensional. Cris Cornell's voice is a perfect fit for this kind of music.
B00000DLVA|5.0|Well...this album is a turn to more full-on show their darker side...and i applaud them for it.<BR>This album is dreary at times, yet not fully...it is filled with detached, yet insightful commentary, groovy beats...and...CooLness!:)<BR>Songs like Paralyzed, Erase/Rewind, Starter, Marvel Hill, My Favourite Game, and Do You Belive, are standout tracks on the album, all of them with a melodic, yet scratchy edge. The only one of those i've got a complaint about is the over-pessimsim of &quot;Do You Believe&quot;, which suggests that love isn't worth much in the end. Yet someohw, the pessimism is almost amusing, making it a piece with a double meaning, perhaps.<BR>This collection of electronica-ballads is not so dark as many say...but it is rather serious. Yet not too serious...there are many opinions one can form about this album, and I shall end this review by saying that with repeated listening, it becomes more interesting.
B000001ABD|5.0|This is definitely a great place to start for casual Stevie listeners; this has a lot of the classics.  Everything from &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot; to the amazing cover of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song&quot; to close the album is absolutely worth a listen.
B00005JM1D|5.0|I just saw this movie about three hours ago, and I have to say it is the best movie I've seen in the theater in a long, long time.  The starring cast is unbelievable, as Luke Wilson (from 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'Legally Blonde'), Will Ferrell (SNL funnyman/'A Night At The Roxbury' star), and Vince Vaughn (from both 'Made' and 'Swingers') star as three married buddies who begin a fraternity; or something like it.  And along with the three stars, there's a great list of supporting roles and cameos.  Including Sean William Scott (Stifler of 'American Pie'), Andy Dick, CBS Late Late Show's Craig Kilborn, and Jeremy Piven.  And once you get past the long cast list, you have a very funny movie.  As the movie starts, you get a glimpse of each of the three stars and their lives; as far as their marriages go.  Then as it turns out, none of them are really happy.<br />And as Mitch (Luke Wilson) gets divorced and moves into a frathouse near a college, they decide to start a fraternity.  But it's not like any old club on campus--for this one you don't even have to go to the college.  Anyway, as the film roles on, you can imagine what (and if you saw the previews, you get the gist of it) they do.  They drink, party, and slowly drift away from the lives they have with their wives.  And I have to say, out of the three star performances, Vince Vaughn's was the best.  Will Ferrell's certainly is the funniest, but Vince was great.  He sort of carries in the same swagger-style he had in the riotous movie 'Made'; something that works very well for him.  I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that the previews don't even begin to prepare you.  It's definitely not one of those movies that is only funny in the previews.  The laughs portrayed there are multiplied by 100, at least.<br />For those of you who saw 'Road Trip' you'll not be let down with 'Old School'.  And being that it's from the same director (Todd Phillips), that makes sense.  But this one is better.  Much better.  This time around the director takes it to a whole new level.  And the characters are more well-rounded here than they were in 'Road Trip'.  The slogan of the movie says it all: \\"All the fun of college.  None of the education.\\"  I think that speaks for itself.<br />So I could leave you here saying that if you liked 'Road Trip' you will like 'Old School'; and that's it.  But that's not true.  This is not just a \\"teen cult\\" movie--or whatever they're calling it these days--it's much much more than that.  It's a hilarious movie with an astonishing/almost too hilarious cast that will keep you laughing even through the closing credits (courtesy of Ferrell and Vince).  And it's not every day I put an exclamation point on my review titles, much less two.  I gave the movie 5 stars because that's what it deserves.  It's a 5 star movie, there's not getting around it.  And again, if you saw the previews and you laughed (or even thought about laughing) then you need to see this movie.  There's so many great lines and so many awesome scenes that I couldn't even begin to list them; I wouldn't know where to start.  Go see this movie.better.

B000000H3Z|5.0|This is sepultura in their glory days. Back when they could compete with any of the metal heavyweights, such as Slayer, Metallica, etc. Before they fell in love with korn's production. Before mallcore max left to form soulfly. Sepultura were thrash gods. The best tracks: Inner Self, Stronger than Hate, Mass Hypnosis, Lobotomy, Primitive Future.<br />The riffing and drumming on here are killer. I especially like the drumming. Igor is easily one of my favorite drummers.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|....That line from the fun and bouncy &quot;In The Musicals&quot; describes my feelings about this exquisite soudtrack exactly.<BR>I can't imagine why so many consider this a career low-point, when it goes along with a wonderful movie, enhancing the telling of the story of a woman in desperation, denial, and courageousness, so eloquently.<BR>There are so many words I could use to express how much I love this music...some say it's only enjoyable with the movie to go along with it, but, even though I think it's better to see &quot;dancer in the dark&quot; first as an explanation, I often listen to this and am swept away by the magical, lush emotional involvement with the character which brought abotu the magical lush pieces...<BR>It may be short, but to me it is yet another musical landmark from another musical genius...<BR>Songs like Cvalda, I've Seen It All...Scatterheart...In The Musicals...New World and the other introductions and interludes will be forever unforgettable to you.<BR>I know I sound all trite in what I'm saying, but I couldn't be more sincere!<BR>Buy this one, Definitely!! Or miss out...&lt;^]
B00004XONN|5.0|Simply one of the greatest albulms ever made it challenges Ok computer to be Radioheads best record.  At first its just irritating pulses and its only on about the billionth listen that you begin to appreciate the genius behind this alternative masterpiece.
B000089A07|5.0|Red Dragon completes the Hannibal Lecter trilogy with new scenes never before included in the novel that expand the role of Dr. Hannibal Lecter and give us the story of his capture by FBI Investigator Will Graham (Edward Norton).<br />Jack Crawford convinces the now retired Will Graham to help track down a killer known as The Tooth Fairy, a man who brutally kills entire families. But Graham needs help, he must recover the mindset of a serial killer, he must visit his arch-enemy, the cunning Dr. Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Graham quickly discovers that the evil doctor may be contained, but he can't be controlled and it just might cost Graham and his family their lives.<br />This is probably the second-best of this thrilling trilogy. I recommend this to anyone who liked \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Hannibal\\".
B000002HH2|5.0|Until now, I have been afraid to review her CDs for fear of attempting to put into words the sheer beauty...and fall short of the truth.<BR>This album...is life-changing. It is the first Bjrk album I ever bought, and there is nothing dated about it. It will stay under your skin...it will truly make you laugh...and cry...and dance...and so many things. She doesn't realize the brilliance of her work, but this album will leave you speachless.<BR>The opener, Army Of Me, is a groovey song with a message...Hyperballad wrenches the heart, describes a situation accurately with beautiful instrumentation to make one think...The Modern Things will definitely have you staring enchantedly into your stereo-speaker as if it were about to something amazing from inspiration from this joyous and twinkley number...&quot;it's oh so quiet&quot; will make you laugh and kick back, and perhaps even dance....(note that her music videos are breath-taking too), Enjoy makes a brilliant, pounding and lush return to a techno wonderland of intense noises and serious music...and, as on all of her albums, the &quot;interlude&quot; song before the next big song &quot;you've been flirting again&quot; has gorgeous string arrangements, and is very short, yet teasing to the mind...&quot;isobel&quot; another big song, and a single tells an imaginative and thoughtful story over beauteous strings and &quot;jungle-istic&quot; beats...Possibly Maybe is a chilled out song somehow tinged with heartbreak the soars with the use of the slide guitar...and &quot;I miss you&quot; is the last energetic, feceitious, yet emotional song on the album that will definitely make you smile and dance(the video from this song is from the ren&amp;stimpy animators! :-))...and then...&quot;cover me&quot; a short and mysterious song with interesting background noises will prepare you wonderfully for the closing song &quot;headphones&quot;, which praises the joy of falling asleep with the wonders of modern technology enabling youto listen to music, and the solitary and instinctive pulses...<BR>Ah well! I may sound like a crazy gusher, but this was so simply amazing, I cannot help but spread the joy!<BR>Just buy this and GET INTO IT!!:^))
B00005JLRR|5.0|I'm not sure about everyone else but I loved this movie, I thought it was the best one they've done so far.  There was much more action and it kept me on the edge towards the end.  I rate it 5 out of 5.
B00000IAU3|3.0|This is not bad. It does grow on one after a while. But it's somehow not &quot;great&quot;. It's a bit too relaxing in many ways...sleep-inducing in places. but perhaps i should give it more listens. And maybe i'll even change my review. But this album seems to affect me in two directions...both thinking it's pleasant and interesting, and thinking it lacks too much.<BR>Perhaps it will leave you that way too.<BR>But songs like &quot;hunter&quot; and &quot;here with me&quot; are truly stellar. I think there's more to be found here...
B000003TAL|5.0|I'm a fan of noisy and chaotic guitars. Greg Ginn, Caspar Brötzmann, Keith Rowe, Norman Westberg, Elliot Sharp, Derek Bailey among others are in my \\"black list\\" of musical heroes. This list would be incomplete without Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo. Their guitar work is complete emotive and with no mercy of any kind. The guitar (and its treatment) is an important tool in all works by Sonic Youth but the real difference is in SY musical approach. I would labeled it as \\"Evil Pop\\". Only must have that noise guitar generator, urban lyrics, a beatiful female voice (with strong attitude) and landscape functional drums. The result: Daydream Nation, the best rock album of 80's.
B00005JLXC|2.0|I saw \\"Daredevil\\" on opening day, against my better judgement.  I had read the scathing reviews in the Boston Globe and Entertainment Weekly, but I was willing to give it a shot.  I mean, it's Ben Affleck in leather...<br />However, I was ultimately disappointed.  Not because of what the Globe and EW had mentioned but for other reasons.  Ben Affleck plays the tormented Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer (who somehow subsists on only pro bono work) out for venegance as his alterego Daredevil.  Ever since he witnessed the death of his father as a child, he is on a serious rage streak (oddly reminiscent of his character in \\"Changing Lanes\\"), and he is out for blood against the city's evil-doers.  However, his superhero status is not so black hat vs. white hat.  In fact, at several points in the movie, he questions if his vengeance is actually making him a bad guy as well.  Very interesting, right?<br />Well, let me just say here that these attempts to make Murdock interesting just make the Ben Affleck even less effective in this role.  He just lacks the sincerity to pull off the tormented superhero.  In addition, the way the story is written doesn't establish any of the characters very well to begin with.  <br />This is especially true of Elektra Natchios, played by the svelte Jennifer Garner.  I admit, she has a great physique and killer moves, but her character just seems like a fluffy side-story.  For some reason, she has been raised as some sort of Amazon martial arts warrior woman.  But why?  \\"My father never wanted me to be a victim.\\"  OK, MY dad doesn't want me to be a victim either.  Doesn't mean they'd have sent me to army training maneuvers over Camp Horizons.  <br />However, the movie wasn't ALL bad.  Colin Farrell makes a comical but deadly foil as Bullseye, and Daredevil's arch-nemesis Kingpin (played by Michael Clarke Duncan) is sufficiently evil as the criminal mastermind of the city.  The action sequences are good as well.<br />So, to sum it up, Daredevil isall action, no talk.  The characters are poorly developed, and you just can't get very interested in them.
B000003S0P|5.0|This is the best King Crimson line-up ever (Robert Fripp, John Wetton and Bill Brufford). This is a dream full of bright and sharping musical ideas. If you compare KC first age (1969-1971) with this &quot;golden age&quot; you could hear the difference. Intelligent virtuosistic performance, better musicianship, avant-gardist sound in a rock format. Every song has its own life. &quot;Red&quot; is a heavy overture with a delicious guitar ostinato and a beauty dark harmony. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; seems like a prototipic &quot;crimsonian&quot; ballad; gorgeus but terrorific, sublime but static, consonat and dissonant. &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot; is a vivid track, hard and virtuoso (listen to Bill Brufford in a virulent exercise of strenght and virtuosity). &quot;Providence&quot; one of the best improv moments of King Crimson, the real and naked gorgeusity of dissonance. &quot;Starless&quot; the great finale for this album with one of the most  intelligent track by King Crimson. But enough of words, listening speaks louder than......
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola run is a foreign film (German with English subtitles) that has much mainstream appeal. Without giving away too much the story revolves around Lola and her Boyfriend (Manni) in a bid to get 100,000 Marks in 20 minutes to save Manni from a rather unpleasant encounter with some thugs.  The film moves at a fast pace as it replays the same 20 minutes over and over each showing how actions even trivial ones may have a profound effects on others. For example in one running Lola bumps into a woman and that triggers a series of events that causes the woman to lose her child to protective services which leads her to kidnap a baby. In another running she merely brushes past the woman and the woman ends up winning the lottery and lives happily ever after.  <br />Far from being bored with the replaying of the 20 minutes the move keeps your attention as you watch for the discrepancies between the runs. You find yourself asking was that element in the previous run? Why is that person walking there? Do they have a part in a future running? Just when you think you know everything about the runs the final run still has eye openers...<br />The DVD has an English soundtrack that almost makes you feel that your not watching a foreign language film at all with the action and the sound track being so in sync.
B000002U9W|5.0|Many will say that DSOTM is their best but I would consider them wrong. I am a huge Floyd fan and this album is the best, the Wall couldn't hold a candle to it. The first song is like 23 minutes long and it's the greatest most amazing song out there.
B0000894RZ|4.0|While there is no denying the talent of Lisa Stansfield and this CD is a very welcome addition, I am disappointed that the US version is missing the remixes offered on the import.  Having had to buy FACE UP as an import, not offered in the US, I should have realized that us American Lisa fans, should do the same with BIOGRAPHY.  You might as well the whole Lisa story on one great CD!
B000000H4V|5.0|if you're around my age (25) you and all your headbanger friends had this album when you were in High School it was issued to you almost like a rite of passage. It was one of the fews times that you were outcast by your friends \\"if you didn't own ChaosAD\\". This was the most anticipated album I had ever seen released even more than \\"justice for all\\" when it first came out and that says alot. The album lived up to the hype and solidified Sepultura as the new kings of metal (if only for a short while). I find it so interesting that the youngblood have never even heard of this album, well they should considering all the bands they listen to stole virtually every idea they have off this album (and Demanufacture) but hey maybe this album has influenced someone somewhere who will take a que from it's genious and possibly make the 'NEW' Sepultura. A good thought anyways!! MAX COME BACK!!!!!!
B00006879E|5.0|Mix a little bit of this and a little bit of that and what do you get...Maroon 5. This band can't be secluded to one genre, they're really all over the musical spectrum. From funk to soul to pop to rock, this band blends everything together creating a fresh new sound. Yes, others are trying this sound, but Maroon 5 has mastered it, creating an album that is fun and very sexy. For the first time in quite a while I can say that I have bought a CD that doesn't sound like anything else I own. <br />Musically they use funk electric guitar, pop-rock guitar, keyboards, hand claps...basically this is a big musical album. The vocals on this album absolutely can't be ignored. Adam Levine (lead vocals) sings his heart out. In every song his teardrop voice is filled with genuine passion and soul (stand out vocal performance \\"Sunday Morning\\"). Lyrically they follow the same trend as they do vocally and musically, impressive.<br />This CD just makes me smile, makes me move, makes me groove and makes me sing...and last but certainly not least, makes me listen to it over and over again and tell everyone to do the same. I heard \\"Harder to Breath\\" and a few other songs and before I could even buy the CD, I made it my mission to spread the word about this band. Everyone I know knows about them now and so should you. Buy this album...Buy It! Buy It! You'll love it...
B000000WA4|5.0|Before this album came out I hated the smashing pumpkins, I loathed them, couldn't stand the sight of them, and when I heard about their \\"new\\" album coming out I thought \\"great another 2 years of the Smashing Pumpkins...lucky me!!\\" Bullet With Butterfly Wings came out first and I thought \\"OK one good song so what??\\" but after 1979 came out I was noticing a trend.....The Smashing Pumpkins RULED!!! I bought the album and fell in love with every track on both CDs. Kinda weird that a band I had hated so much would eventually make my favorite album of all time. If you love emotionally charged music well this album is the epitome and musically it is as original as it gets although some may say it's just a throwback to the Prog-rock Art albums of the 70's (rush,Kansas,PinkFloyd,etc..) which may be true but add some heavy metal, new wave, and 80's-esque goth you have an interesting album. #1
0385508417|5.0|If you're from a small town (or even if you're not) you will love this book.  Set in a little community, this novel gives a slightly exaggerated view of what it is like to live in a place where everyone knows everyone else and thinks that they need to know everything about everyone else, as well.<br />This book is completely different from any other Grisham has written, and it is probably my all-time favorite book.  It is absolutely hilarious and I promise you won't be able to put it down!
B000000H5J|5.0|My favorite metal album os all time is \\"wolverine Blues\\" by Entombed but damn does \\"Demanufacture\\" come ever close!!! I remember hating this album when I first got it because I was hoping for \\"Soul Of A New Machine2: Electric Boogaloo\\" and when there was no \\"scumgrief\\" or \\"Martyr\\" track on the album I was bummed but I gave a second try, then a 3rd and then I don't know when but I just fell in love with it. To this day I'm not sure if I've heard an album that covers all bases like this one and you can be sure that no one made records like this before hand. So many of these nu-metal bands ripped \\"soul\\" and \\"Demanufacture\\" but they could never rekindle the feeling Fear Factory evoked when this album came out in 95. I had friends who were listening to Coolio and Bone Thugs when they heard this album they were floored then  became HUGE Fear Factory fans. Everything FF did afterwards well....to be honest were marginal at best but even now we remain faithful to FF hoping they can recapture the passion and spirit they demonstrated on this album. Not the same sound mind you but the same spirit and now is the time we need it the most.
B00005JLXC|1.0|Nothing happened in this entire movie. Do you know who the Kingpin is and why he does what he does? I don't, and I've grown up reading about the character! Atrocious acting (Michael Clark Duncan is WAY overrated, Ben Affleck is emotionless) and a terrible non-existent script make me ashamed for Hollywood in general.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Her album title could not have been more appropriate.  Strip away all the garbage headlines about her (\\"X-Tina Breaks Glass Everywhere!\\") and her style of dress (or undress), Christina Aguilera is one of the most vocally talented women (no more little \\"Genie in A Bottle\\" Christina), she can totally hold her own with all of the more powerful fermale vocalists out there.  This album brings to the forefront what that big voice can do.  Tracks like \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" provide another side to this R&B princess but the showstopper on \\"Stripped\\" is \\"Impossible\\", a collaboration with Alicia Keys that absolutely had my hair standing on end. She has a great sound and you can truly tell where her musical interests lie, this is just not a pop or R&B album.  If you love musical artists who use their voices as a musical instrument, you WILL love this album. Strip those preconceived notions about Christina Aguilera and just sit back and listen. You'll be glad you did.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Wow.... this is what remastering is good for. The sound, the energy and intensity is incredible. This sounds like it was just recorded yesterday! Now, if you haven't heard at least one song off this album, chances are you are a complete recluse. This is one of the ultimate hard rock/heavy metal masterpieces of all time. Every song rocks hard and every song is a winner. No fillers here. So quit wasting your money on all this nu-metal and modern pop garbage and get some of the REAL stuff.
B000002KHF|5.0|It's not often that you find this much fantabulous music on ONE CD! This is something you'll never get tired of listening to, once I take it out of my CD player, I want it back in there! The Bluesy, Jazzy, bopping music and lyrics make you want to dance, sing, sit back and relax and get mellow with your eyes closed all at once as Van the Man spins his tales in your head. It's just great, something I can't imagine NOT having in my collection. So put it in your CD player, put on the headphones, turn it up and sing along with Van, you'll enjoy yourself for sure.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I just saw Scary Movie and it was very very funny i thought Shorty(Marlon Wayans)was HILLARIOUS and Bobby was cute so i think it was very funny
B00006LLNU|4.0|Someone said already that this album was weird.<br />Well, yeah. But what else are we supposed to expect from Sigur Ros?<br />The much-hyped follow up to Agaetis Byrjun, an excellent album in its' own right, is, although great, not as great as its' predecessor. Sigur Ros manages to use their incredibly beautiful atmospheres to paint up so many things in your imagination while only using a few instruments. Unfortunately, I think I like it better when Jonsi sings in Icelandic. It's fine to &quot;make up&quot; your own language, but if &quot;eesile on&quot; is the only phrase in it, then please, go back to Icelandic.<br />Other than that, it's still worth a listen. Vaka (track 1), is a sad, but beautiful song with a warm synth and piano most of the way through, and makes it one of my favourites. Another favourite is Njosnavelin (track 4), which had already appeared in movies, but with the live recording. The studio version of Njosnavelin seems much happier sounding; more hopeful and such, probably to do with the addition of harmonized vocals at one point. It removes having anything to do with the unofficial title of the song, &quot;The Nothing Song&quot;.<br />The rest of the tracks are quite good, and would do you well in a relaxing setting, if you're a previous fan of Sigur Ros. I'd imagine this isn't easy to love if it's your first listen of SR, but for those of you rather willing to hear something totally different, ( ) is for you.
0380713802|4.0|Before embarking on a longish trip, Jill and I like to read about the places we are going to visit. Not just guidebooks--although I must admit we buy those by the pound--but travelogues, histories, and novels set in those areas. Sometimes this is easy. Italy and the Galapagos are well represented in literature. Other places are not so visited by those whose inclinations are to put pen to paper or hands to keyboard, including Ecuador and Costa Rica. At the present, I am unsure of where Austria and Switzerland will fall, but the thought has crossed my mind that a well-placed proposal might nab me a book contract.<br />As histories go, Austria is completely overshadowed by its larger German-speaking neighbor. This is unfortunate. While it is understandable that historians be interested in Germany, Austria has plenty to answer for in the last century as well. The same goes for the Swiss, who sorely need some bright lights shone in their shady vaults and executive suites, as the recent findings about Jewish bank accounts proves.<br />The problem in travelogues lies in the fact that no travel writer seems to go to either of these countries by themselves. Nestled in the heart of Europe, they are waystops between places--like from Germany to Italy or France to Russia--and while travelers may make it a point to stop in, say Salzburg or Zurich, for the night, the urge to stay never comes over them. According to Bill Bryson, the lack of this urge may not be wholly the blame of the visitor.<br />Austria and Switzerland each get a chapter (out of the total 22) in Bryson's Neither Here Nor There. Similar to his first travelogue, The Lost Continent, this one has Bryson still trying to recapture earlier days, but in Europe. Although American by birth, Bryson is thoroughly British in his writing and wit. His journeys resemble those of Redmond 0'Hanlon, except more cosmopolitan acid without a companion. It is not that things go wrong necessarily, but that when they do so he describes it so hilariously.<br />Something that Bryson does not describe is how he can afford his trip-- both in time and money. He mentions wife and children seldomly, although he has both. He does not mention regular employment, but I get the feeling that he is not independently wealthy either. It is neither here nor there, but I am intensely curious (if only to see if it is possible to emulate).<br />I am not sure that I learned that much about my upcoming vacation here, but Europe through Bryson's eyes is almost as much fun as going yourself.it so hilariously.<br />Something that Bryson does not describe is how he can afford his trip-- both in time and money.

B000059ZLH|5.0|I would like to say first of all that I'm not going to fault this DVD for the lack of surround sound and letter box. This DVD was produced by musicians, not professionals, and it was intended for musicians, not home-theater aficionados. However, despite the lack of surround sound, the STEREO sound that exists here is very well-mixed with a great balance of each instrument. It is a little on the quiet side, it seems, however. <br />Now that the technicalities are out of the way, this DVD is fantastic. Its only drawback are the brief bits of &quot;concept footage&quot; that are spread throughout the performance of the Metropolis album (it gets especially annoying during &quot;Finally Free&quot;). Mike Portnoy is an excellent drummer, but a terrible filmmaker and it shows sometimes. <br />This DVD contains the entire Metropolis 2 album played straight through INCLUDING a guitar/vocal duet track before &quot;Through her eyes&quot; and an additional Closing Scene at the end of &quot;Finally Free&quot;. Especially fantastic is the presence of Theresa Thomason, and the hypnotherapist to make this performance a true reenactment of the studio album. The band itself is absolutely brilliant throughout. Everything from the pounding chords of Strange Deja Vu, to the frenzy of Dance of Eternity, to the breathtaking drum fills at the end of Finally Free that have to be seen to believed is executed perfectly. Well, almost perfectly (Petrucci plays a rather noticeable wrong note in &quot;Home&quot; and it is my opinion that the &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; solo is a little bit sloppy. Jordan Rudess also makes a mistake too, at the end of Finally Free). <br />However, the band MORE than makes up for the few tiny blunders by absolutely nailing the entirety of most songs (including Dance of Eternity) and many of the live &quot;extensions&quot; they add to songs (such as Spirit Carries On and Finally Free) are absolutely amazing and truly have to be seen to be appreciated. This DVD undoubtedly displays the finest hour of Dream Theater's legendary career. If you like Dream Theater, this is it, folks. <br />In addition to Metropolis 2, this DVD contains undisturbed (no video effects) footage of the entirety of &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot;, &quot;Learning to Live&quot;, and &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;. Also, there are a few live shots of Metropolis I and The Mirror in the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; portion of the DVD. There is a &quot;World Tour Photo Gallery&quot;, but its not something to write home about.<br />Annoying video effects and concept footage aside, this DVD is simply amazing. I was worried at first from reading other reviews that the aforementioned video FX would disrupt the experience, but they are only a slight inconvenience. And besides, Dream Theater can easily shine through any inconvenience, large or small.
0385503954|5.0|...I bought the book on the strength of other books I have read and enjoyed by Ian McEwan. However, having read it, I was curious to know how others had reacted to it due to a niggling question mark that arose in my mind at a certain point in the reading and stayed until the end.<br />I personally rate this book as one of the most readable novels I have ever read, even with this rather unfair reservation on my part. As the addiction to page turning increased, so did my admiration for the author's technique. I was aware that I was being manipulated in the hands of a masterful technician who was double guessing my reactions, laying traps, playing with my emotions and eventually surprising me. Yes, even that slow, delicately understated opening that some reviewers complain of is purposefully low keyed, making the reader make the effort to get into gear and on into the story of prewar England, its countryside and social fabric. I always have the feel of music in Ian McEwan's writing and this was a slow opening movement that eventually crescendos into sustained raw feeling that kept this reader turning pages into the early hours.  This is a wonderful tale of love, hate and humanity with characters that jump off the page with life and I was sorry when I reached the end.  I would recommend this book to all and Ian McEwan is welcomed to use his enormous literary skills to spellbind this reader again in the future.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is 2hrs 13mins of pure art. I've never seen better animation than this. Breath-taking!    Visuals:5/5<BR>The music is wonderful.  The voice acting is pretty good, but the japanese track is better. I'm grateful that they included both.     Sound:4/5<BR>The characters are great. The storyline is deep. Story:5/5<BR>I've watched this movie countless times, and it still holds up.  Overall:5/5
B00005AAFS|5.0|What can I say, this cd is Rammsteins best yet. Nothing but pure fist-pumping hardcore music that could make anyone want to get up and mosh. So I made a list to explain the greatness of each track...<BR>1. Mein Herz Brennt-(10/10)This song is one of their best no doubt, starting out slow and melodic to a more hard riff, amazing to say the least.<BR>2. Links 234-(9-10)Another awesome Rammstein song with cool riffs and a catchy chorus.<BR>3. Sonne-(10/10)This is another one of my favorites, the guitar riffs are right on and the chorus makes you want to just sing along.<BR>4. Ich Will-(9-10)A good song with a cool lyrics, guitar riffs, and techno.<BR>5. Feuer Frei-(10/10)Most likely the hardest song on the album with it's heavy licks and the roudy chorus and yelling of Bang Bang!   <BR>6. Mutter-(10/10)Another favorite, this song is full of raw and heavy emotion, this could be Rammsteins best yet.<BR>7. Spieluhr-(9/10)A spooky track that has a starnge erie feeling, but still a good song<BR>8. Zwitter-(9/10)A very funny song if you translate it, with a lot of heavy riffs.<BR>9. Rein Raus-(9/10)An average Rammstein song, but still awesoem none the less.<BR>10. Adios-(9/10)An almost punk feel, that shows off Rammsteins pumping guitar riffs.<BR>11. Nebel-(9/10)A slow song with a very spooky feel and cool effects.<BR>As you can see this cd is full of Rammstein's best, a classic cd.
0345350499|5.0|When I started this book, I was only interested in reading a little more Arthurian romance. What I got instead was a rare, beautiful book that made me reevaluate my feelings about faith, gender, and love. This is a consuming book; be careful with it.
B0000029AL|5.0|This is a really great album.  I rememeber the first time I listened to it.  It was great.  Here are the song reviews:<BR>1. Make It: good show opener, good song to start an album off with.  I listened to this one so much.  But I remember i was listening to my tape of it and my sister came and pressed record while i was listening to it, and right in the middle of the song you can hear &quot;ah, no!&quot; and then its over.  I cried.  I was so mad.<BR>2. Somebody: I thought that the guitars sounded so weird.  I dont know, It was the first time I heard it and I heard Joe Perry's voice singing in the end and i thought he had the coolest voice.  Next to Steven Tyler.  I tried to make my voice sound like that.<BR>3. Dream On: I was get nervous after Somebody because I loved this song so much and I didnt want to miss one bit of it.  This song is just as good as everybody says it is.  If Aerosmith would re-record it in a studio, it would probably sound amazing.<BR>yeah i dont wanna do the rest except for walking the dog<BR>8. Walking The Dog: This was my most FAVORITE song for the longest time.  Id play it EVEYTIME id go to play my drums and if i didnt play it then id go right back down to the basement to play it.  aight there.<br />-JOHN
B000069HK2|5.0|When I first bought this cd, my dad laughed at me because of course he saw Bert on The Osbournes. But, that is definitely not the reason I bought the cd. Wow, i dont know what to say. It's is an awesome cd! Bert's vocals are awesome and the quitar is great with his voice. The best songs are &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot;, &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot;, &quot;A Box of Sharp Objects&quot;, and &quot;Blue and Yellow.&quot; The album is truly amazing and there are songs for all tastes. Of course there is the head-banging metal songs, extremely slow songs, and others that actually dont fit into any category. You cant go wrong with this cd. It's greatness.
0451204530|3.0|I haven't read many Ken Follett books, in fact only three. But I am quite impressed with the style of writing in the book. However, the basic subject hasn't been portrayed as well as it could be. There are a lot of books on this subject, the best I can remember is Robert Ludlum's &quot;The Bourne Identity (TBI).&quot; I think this book fails to deliver the thrills of TBI, but due to his simple and to the point style of writing, Mr. Follett has found a new fan, in me.
B000063DHL|5.0|alright, so i dont own the album (yet). but thanks to the internet ive been able to preview most of the songs on the album. wow. very melodic metal, which is definitely a good thing. i agree with other reviews that Wasted Years may have been made to get them into the mainstream, but good none-the-less. By far my favorite song on the cd is The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner. You can only truly appreciate it if youv run a cross country race, but i imagine its a good song if you havent too. This song basically sums up all the highlights of a good race, and when listening to it it always brings back images of races ive been in. its just amazing how well he made the song seem like your in a race. even during the breaks i feel like im running. anyways, i plan on listneing to this song before avery race i run in from now on, its amazing.
B000002HAJ|4.0|When the Cure's \\"Wish\\" came out back in 1992, I wasn't much of a fan of the band. All this time later, though, I think The Cure were a great band, and this is a good album.<br /><br />\\"Wish\\" is a bit of an emotional roller coaster ride, as the songs sway back and forth between bleakness, hope and sometimes playful lyrics. \\"High\\" is just as sprightly as the classic \\"Friday I'm in Love,\\" and there are other songs on \\"Wish\\" that have the same joyous style. By contrast, the subdued \\"Apart,\\" which follows \\"High,\\" is the Cure at its most downbeat -- and \\"Wish\\" has more of those types of songs, too.<br /><br />Compared to the classic Cure album [[ASIN:B000002H70 Disintegration]], \\"Wish\\" is less abstract, musically more diverse and more organic. The drumming isn't as stilted as the band's late-1980s output, the guitars are more prominent and the CD seems less conceptualized. What's similar between the two eras is Robert Smith's heartache over love lost. Good songs like \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,\\" \\"Wendy Time,\\" \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" and \\"Cut\\" also display a sense of jubilation to be making music, despite whatever backburner status The Cure may have had during the \\"grunge\\" era of the 1990s.<br /><br />One song really shines on \\"Wish,\\" and that's the last one, \\"End.\\" It comes off as the culmination of Smith's years as a first-rate songwriter, singer and a man out on tour with his band as he slowly goes mad. \\"End\\" truly sounds like a song that was designed to be Smith's last, though that was hardly the case. He sounds tired, resigned and ready to stop; his echoey vocals say it all: \\"I think I've reached that point/When giving up and going on/Are both the same dead-end to me.\\" When he sings \\"Please stop loving me\\" over and over, you know Smith has had it. It's a mesmerizing song that is more than just a lament over fleeting time or a case of depression: It's also a cry of indifference, boredom. Thankfully, other spunky tunes on \\"Wish\\" indicate that Smith and his mates were still having a good time at this point in the band's history.good time at this point in the band's history.
0679805273|5.0|Since Dr. Seuss is one of my all-time favorite authors, of course this book is wonderful!  The illustrations are awesome, and the book is great for any age.  If you are as big of a Dr. Seuss fan as I am, you will definitely love it!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's albulm,\\"Let Go\\" is possibly the best albulm I have ever bought. When I bought it, I didn't really know who she was but then I began to listen to her CD over and over again and became attached with all of her songs right away. And if you like hard rock and and other stuff like that, then why are you even saying how much she ...?! When I think pop, I think Britney Spears and Nsync, Avril is denfintly not like them!!!!! I think she pretty much has her own style of music. Avril Lavingne just rocks out, and she will continue to do so!!!!
B000088E6D|5.0|For a newcomer Michael Buble has made an entrance onto the music scene with a voice and style both new and polished. What is more suprising that it comes from a young man with a passion and maturity to sing the songs as they can be sung. What made me buy this CD was his version of &quot;You'll Never Find Another&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;. I would never have envisioned a rock song slowed down to a crooner's tempo but son of a gun it works and works well. Thank you Michael, keep singing and keep the cd's coming
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Although many people don't agree with their video or lyrics, t.A.T.u. speaks to many of us positively.  Their lyrics show all the sides of love for all people, not just lesbians.  They took the United States by storm with their unique sound, a mix of pop and techno.  This was just what the pop scene needed, a refreshingly new sound.  Fans of Daft Punk and Moby will share an interest with those who like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.  t.A.T.u. unites these two completely different tastes in just one album.  I highly recommend the purchase of this album if you're into airy, angelic vocals and dance worthy beats.
B00005JL78|4.0|I don't even know how to explain this film. After all these years tom is still a good actor. The movie is about a world where people get arrested for crimes that they are about to commit. I have seen a lot of films, but this was really good.
B00008DDXC|4.0|\\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" is a excellent representation of the novel. No unnecessary plot changes so the \\"purists\\" will be pleased. The cast is made of the same delightful kids that made the first movie such fun. <br />I would judge the novel as the weakest of the series, but still it is a lot of fun. The acting on the part of the kids is much improved, and the addition of the new characters adds to the production quality. While some of the technical and special effects could have been \\"hotter\\" they served their purpose and did not detract from the presentation.  The four stars I give the movie would be the compromise of 5 stars for acting and presentation of a 3 star book.<br />With the death of Richard Harris last year, the next movie must suffer some from inconsistancy with our preconcetion of Prof. Dumbledoor, But as Ian Mclellon (Gandolph from The Lord of The Rings) is rumored to have accepted the part for the \\"Prisoner Of Alkazam\\" we can look forward to continued fun. There is some doubt about the cast of the third movie Kids parts but I am sure that some renegotiations will solve that.<br />Overall a fun all-ages movie well worth adding to a home library.
6305291500|5.0|Lots of mermaid fun!  In this movie, you have a chance to see a young Tom Hanks in one of his earliest major roles.  Even then, you could see that he had already developed into quite an actor.  You can really feel his emotions in each scene.  You can't help feeling that he should have been doing more serious work at that time in his career.  To tell the truth though, we all fell in love with him in these goofy comedies and fantasies of the eighties.  If you like Tom, this should be in your library.
0671042734|1.0|Nearly halfway through this book and I couldn't keep the characters straight, couldn't tell who was speaking, or if the action was set in the past or present.  Did I need to read a prequel?  I'm no wimp, having read War and Peace with clarity and enjoyment, but I just gave up.  Realizing this book was filling me with dread, I left it on the subway.
B00003CXA6|4.0|Gettsyburg is too historical to grab the casual viewer, but this isn't North and South after all.  At the same time, many Civil War buffs can see all the omissions here, as the epic three day battle is reduced to three pivotal events.  Despite this, Gettysburg is a must-see for those interested in the Civil War and history in general.  The battle scenes are quite good at times, and the larger issues are explored as well, albeit in some overlong scenes of philosophizing around the campfire.<br />Martin Sheen is an acquired taste as Lee, but he does portray the general's temperament pretty accurately.  Lee was an aggressive general, and Sheen plays him as a stubbornly willed man who means to take on \\"those people\\" in a direct assault, despite the risk of disaster.  Tom Berenguer plays Longstreet as the calm voice of reason and devil's advocate, with his continued urgings to Lee to \\"go to the right\\".<br />Other good performances include the ever-crusty Sam Elliot as Union cavalryman John Buford, Richard Jordan as Confederate brigadier Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as Pickett.  Jeff Daniels is the citizen/soldier Joshua Chamberlain who has to hold off the enemy at Little Round Top, and he plays him as a sensitive yet resolute individual.<br />As a film this could have been edited and scripted better, the battle scenes won't satisfy everyone and so much is left out.  (you'd have to read a book to learn about the Peach Orchard, Culp's Hill and other main events).  Still, it's an interesting movie and quite objective overall.
B000002NJS|4.0|This is the first thing by Madonna that I've ever owned. Because of that, I'm not in a position to say whether or not this is her best CD, to comment about how these songs reflect her personal life (I don't pay much attention to that), or to make any comparisons to other music she's recorded. I spent 20 years or so largely ignoring Madonna. My impression was that she was literally the \\"material girl\\" she proclaimed herself to be. A shallow tart who used her sex appeal to sell music and other media products.<br />That changed when I heard the song \\"Ray Of Light\\". Not that it necessarily changed my attitude toward Madonna as a person, but I liked the song very much and it propted me to get the CD. Surprise! The CD is very good. The songs here are complex yet appealing. There is the less-than-subtle torch song (\\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" comes to mind), but many of the lyrics have an introspective quality and the music has an ethereal sound that is very nice to listen to. I was also impressed with the quality of the singing on this CD. I had no reason to suppose that Madonna could actually sing, but her vocals here are very well done. She is expressive and demonstrates both power and range.<br />All in all, RAY OF LIGHT is a very good CD and a very pleasant surprise for me. I will be listening to more of Madonna's work in the future. It is clear that underneath the hype, there is a genuine artist at work here. Though I am generally more of a fan of classic rock than of pop, I recommend this CD.
B00005JLZL|3.0|The intensity level of this movie is incredibly high, there's no question, but what is the director trying to say?  Unlike, say Dead Man Walking or Dancer in the Dark, the message isn't crystal clear, it's quite muddied by the plot, which is in a way good because you do get a plot-driven movie, somewhat of a murder mystery with a message, instead of a preachy piece of work.  The performances were mediocre with the exception of Laura Linney, and the story itself lacked focus.  The \\"twist ending\\" ala Primal Fear and Usual Suspects lacked punch.  It was just muddled and befuddled amperage.
B0000046PE|5.0|Your rating system does not have enough stars available to rate this collection. The sound of Ella's voice, the music selected to make this compilation and the engineering that has re-mastered her earliest recordings is just simply ten stars!
B00005N5S5|5.0|Yes, early in his career Arnold's acting was as stiff as a robot. Which makes this casting of Arnold as the terminator, a robot with a human flesh covering, perfect. Time travelling from the future to the past the terminator's mission is to kill Sarah Connor before she gives birth to a boy who will grow up to be the leader of the resistance to the machines. The only protection for this soon to be single mom is a human sent from the future as well.<br />The story itself was directly from a dream that James Cameron, director of True Lies, The Terminator, Terminator 2, and unfortunately Titanic, had and was able to recreate in this movie.<br />A good usage of a very low budget was what made this movie possible. The budget did affect special affects usage but the stop motion and models make up for most of it.<br />The Terminator is a classic action film but it does have a sub-plot that is interesting if you stop to think about it. Our reliance on computers and the continual strive to create something that has the possibility to destroy us, an idea that is stressed even more in Terminator 2.<br />Overall this is a movie that all action movie buffs have a responsibility to see and is a necessity to any DVD collection. It's a buy you won't regret.
6303418287|1.0|I read Frankenstein recently, and that was difficult enough to sit through.  Then I saw the movie.  My God, what have they done?<br />There are way too many inaccuracies to be mentioned here.  Walton was not supposed tyrant captain, Victor and Clerval were originally childhood friends, the DeLacy's were completely butchered, the relationship between Victor and Elizabeth was completely warped, and the fact that Elizabeth shouldn't have come to see Victor at Ingolstadt are a few of the more minor flaws.  Some major flaws include Clerval not dying, Victor's second attempt at creating life (at the monster's request) not being represented accurately, and the reanimation of Elizabeth.  Others still are the order of deaths (father before Elizabeth?), the nature of deaths, and the ending.<br />To sum everything just said up: Why would a movie pride itself on being like the book when it's really nothing like it?  Aside from a fairly decent DeNiro performance, there's nothing to see.  If they hadn't made a big deal about being like the book, I would have enjoyed it for what it is.  That is, just another Hollywood movie.
B0000797IO|1.0|I am sure this movie was meant to be deep on some level, but it was horrible, I regret buying it. I think Jennifer Aniston is a phenomenal actress, but even she couldn't help this movie.It was way too slow, the main actress brought all of her problems on to herself, which is never addressed. And she walks away scott-free. Completely predictable, you wind up shaking your head the whole time in disbelief/disgust.  Plus it is utterly  anticlimatic, it is slow through the whole movie!She never even tries to talk to her \\"ho-hum\\" husband in the movie, just goes and messes around, with someone else who wasnt all that great either. I would rather use this DVD as a drink coaster.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is a great movie. That's the only description you can give to a movie like Donnie Darko. It was GREAT. I like watching it over and over again because it's so good. I think a movie like this should have gotten an Oscar. A movie I never even saw comercials for.<br />-End
B00005YUNY|5.0|I have been an avid Yes fan since 1972. I have been to almost every concert in the Hartford CT. area since then. I worked as a live concert sound engineer for several years. I also play bass and keyboards. My point is this DVD is the best I have ever seen-heard. The mix is nearly perfect, the visual is excellent, the orchestra fills in just enough and not too much. <BR>I was at the Oakdale theater in Waterford when Yes had the symphony with them there and I loved that, this DVD is even better.<br />Buy this DVD and enjoy Yes as I'm sure the band intended. In fact buy two just in case something happens to the first one.<BR>Gary D.
1573229725|5.0|In a story of double-crossing thieves, Sarah Waters takes us back to dark Victorian London in FINGERSMITH, a beautifully written novel that is wonderfully intriguing, somewhat erotic, and kept this reader completely in suspense from cover to cover.<br />Two young women are orphaned early in life.  Susan Trinder is raised by a band of thieves, calling Mrs. Sucksby the nearest thing to a mother she ever had. They live on Lant Street in the heart of the London Boroughs, a dark and impoverished area of the city. From Sue's window one has a good view of the hangings from Gaol, where she is told her birth mother was hung for murder.  Her \\"friends\\" are Dainty and John Vroom and Mr. Ibbs, who all work and live together with Mrs. Sucksby and Sue, along with a number of babies that Mrs. Sucksby \\"farms\\" to make a living.  Sue was one of those special babies at one time, but Mrs. Sucksby kept and raised Susan as her own daughter, protecting Sue from harm's way, and helps teach her the art of stealing and thievery.<br /> Maud, on the other hand, lives with her Uncle Mr. Lilly in Briar, on a large estate in the countryside many hours away from London by carriage.  She spends her days reading to her uncle and doing things that ladies in her station do - absolutely nothing. She takes walks outside on the estate; she takes tea in her room.  She eats meals with her Uncle at the proper time.  In other words, Maud's life was a totally different world from that of Sue Trinder's.<br />Back on Lant Street, a scam is being laid out.  It is decided that Sue will masquerade as a maid for Miss Lilly, whose Uncle is a business associate of Richard Rivers, known to Sue and her friends as \\"Gentleman\\".  Sue's role in this scam is to help secure a matrimonial match between Gentleman and Maud Lilly, who stands to inherit a fortune upon her wedding.  Sue travels to Briar as Susan Smith with a totally made up identity, and works her way into the life of Maud Lilly, while Gentleman slowly woos his wayinto Maud's heart.  Their plan is to declare Maud insane after she is wed to Gentleman. Then, Richard will take the money that is inherited by Maud, giving a few thousand pounds to Sue as a reward.<br />However, things do not go as planned.  What ensues is a double-crossing upon double-crossing.  Both women find themselves in situations they were not expecting, and soon both are trying their best to rectify things without losing their lives.<br />This is only a trace of what FINGERSMITH is all about.  Besides the intricate plot and subplots that Sarah Waters creates surrounding the scam, Ms. Waters also writes a plot that is not all that it seems.  Written from the viewpoint of both Maud and Sue, the reader receives a jolt of shock when it's time to read Part II, where the story is now told in the voice of Maud Lilly.<br />There are also the wonderful characters that are assembled in this dark Victorian drama.  The two main characters, Maud and Sue, are of course the most integral part of the book, and their relationship while they are maid and mistress borders on erotica.  Then you have the lunatic asylums, the relationship between the different members of Mrs. Sucksby's household, and life at Briar, the dark and old estate that brings to mind novels such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed FINGERSMITH. It was a great story with beautiful writing and characters that jump out at you as if you were watching a film.  I plan on reading Waters other two novels, AFFINITY, and her first novel, TIPPING THE VELVET, soon. FINGERSMITH will definitely be on my list of top 20 books read in 2003.
B00005OM4N|4.0|In these times of strife, I seek Britney for consolation and wisdom - her  music resonates like the mountain scent of a warm candle, within the confines of dusky garage apartment.  Her voice soothes, like the tone of heartfelt poem, read by your very own mother, or another such close relation.<br />\\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" is the poetry Stipe, Vedder and Bono pretend to be, while some of Britney's other raunchier songs....<br />Ah, forget it.  Buy the album and see for yourself.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Not that it's important the Milla is one of the most beautiful females in the world (and Michelle isn't bad either)... this film just had my eyes watching every detail for what was going to come around the next corner... The critics disliked this movie for a lack of plot... uhh... duh it's based on a Video Game... It's a great adaptation of the game, and I'm excited to hear that Part 2 may be on it's way...  Truly worth seeing and owning.
B00006LFGD|1.0|...do yourself a favor and buy the new Linda Eder recording entitled &quot;Broadway My Way&quot;.  Her superior vocal stylings will leave you breathless...guaranteed!
0385720920|4.0|Well, I am not going to try to intellectualize or even try to critique it. I will say that I totally enjoyed it. Yes, it is a dark book with dark humor but that is the attraction.  found it a very quick read (great for travellers) and was entertained from beginning to end. If your humor is on the &quot;darker&quot; side you will enjoy this book a lot. If you are older than 30 you might find the book a little too edgy but give it a try!
