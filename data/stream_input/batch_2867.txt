1616550414|5.0|This book was a treasure we found at the public library and simply had to have. The artwork is incomparable and the information is very in depth. My son just loves it!
B002EDH0FE|4.0|action,adventure,excitement very good movie for all to watch. If you like action watch this show its pretty awsome and you'll like it
B00B3N4CWK|4.0|Classic movie. I ccan't believe that I hadn't seen it yet. I would recommend it for a day when the house is empty.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I don't usually watch this type of movie but this I sat through the hole thing, a must watch for sure.
B00CO4CVN4|4.0|Laid out nicely makes sense only down side cannot print worksheets and tests if you buy ebook , Very annoying should be able to print out the tests because you have to take them a lot.... IE buy the hardcopy!!!!!
B005TBN3EU|5.0|Funny Funny Funny, The Hangover ll is as funny or lots more than the first. If you seen the first show yours gonna love this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was a little hard to understand how to start off, but once you get into it (advancing the levels), it's fun and challenging.  I recommend it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|What a great show, I was sckeptical at first but the show is really a good movie, lots of action,adventure and comidy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle app. I have read more books in the past week than I believe I have ever read.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is the first novel I read by Ken Follett, and I think it is his best.  &#34;The Needle&#34; is the codename for a German spy, living in England at the time of World War II.  The British get onto him, and he must make a desperate run for the northern coast, where he will be picked up by a submarine.  He befriends the wife of a disabled man while waiting for the rendezvous.  She discovers his real identity and a desperate struggle ensues.  This story crackles with conflict and tension, leading to an exciting final confrontation.  &#34;The Eye of the Needle&#34; is everything a modern thriller should be.
B00AVPYT8I|3.0|It doesn't have the books I'm looking for. I look for self help books and educational books that will further me.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|great way to keep up with important notes passwords and information. Great idea.no more trying to remember. info with me at all times
B00514HDNW|5.0|The movie for this book is one of my favorites - I liked both endings they filmed. I was hesitant to read the book. I'd read several reviews where people didn't like it for various reasons and I didn't want it to spoil my appreciation for the movie, but then I read it anyhow.<br /><br />After reading it, I can say this: they were only similar. They both had lead characters named Robert Neville and the creatures in both slept during the day. The book plays out very different from the movie and the ending...well, lets just say the differences between the movie and the book led to an altogether different ending than I had imagined.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Can't do without my kindle and the cord got chewed by my puppy.  Get I could get one so easily and quickly.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very cute and time consuming. One of the best &quot;building&quot; games I've played. Definitely worth downloading any time! Keep up the good work!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very good the only bad thing is that you have to buy stuff with coins o real money, but my kids love it
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|My favorite out of all the versions of Peter Pan. My 5yr old daughter loves it. It really is a great movie. It shipped to us in two days and it was in perfect condition. Also at a great price! All around great experience.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great! I just needed an extra cable for my Kindle Fire & this one is exactly what I needed.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Like other reviewers have stated:  This version is of a lower quality than the free version.  There are no ads but the radar maps don't work (they worked in the free version!).  Other problems with the AccuWeather app compared to the excellent competition (Weatherbug, The Weather Channel, Yahoo Weather, 1Weather, etc):<br /><br /> * It is slow as molasses.<br /> * It asks too many questions on startup.  \\"Can I just see the weather.  PLEASE?!\\"<br /> * Its layout is terrible.  The radar is easily the most important feature and I have to unintuitively swipe three times to the right to get to it.<br /> * Like I stated previously:  The radar maps don't work.  You get a blank screen and a play button.<br /> * Videos? Seriously?  If I wanted to watch videos I'd open YouTube or Vimeo.  If I am opening a weather app you'd think it would be safe to assume I just want to check the weather and not watch a video of someone telling me about the weather in various locations *other than where I am* throughout the world.<br /> * The hourly breakdown doesn't include the chance of precipitation.  There's just icons that have various depictions of clouds.  As an example, all of the other weather apps I have on my tablet show a 40% chance of precipitation pretty much all hours of the day today but Accuweather?  Nope.  Just \\"partly sunny\\" or \\"partly cloudy\\".<br /> * There's a *completely unnecessary*, ever-present black bar at the bottom of the screen constantly reminding me that accuweather.com exists (and apparently it's sunny there!).  Of course, it's not like screen space is at a premium on tablets and phones!  Why not just give me a tiny icon in the corner with the weather and just put up a HUGE AccuWeather.com link in the center of the app at all times--because the website is more useful!<br /> * The whole app freezes with a loading icon when it updates the weather information.  Seriously?  I can't be allowed to view the forecast while the data gets updated in the background?<br /><br />Oh man, I can go on and on about how much this app sucks but I really need to know what the radar looks like to see if I have time to get some yard work done before it rains.  I'll have to open another app for that.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Good Vinyl LP. I recommend to buy this disco. It has very nice songs and daft punk it's amazing. It's a must have.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well worth reading, above and beyond the unfortunate publicity. A scholarly work. I am not an expert in the field, but the arguments made sense to me, and are well documented by apparently reasonable evidence.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I think that it is interesting but not completely captivating. I watch it then don't for awhile then come back to it without missing it.
B004IPPINW|4.0|A well written story, touching on a lot of hot topics for today, perhaps intentionally ambiguous as to morals of characters
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|For those Five Finger death Punch fans, this is a great CD.  Like others, it ranges from fairly mellow to heavy (HEAVY) metal.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|As always, a good and well-directed read. Difficult to tell if it is not quite as compelling as his first two novels, or whether I am simply getting to know his style.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Really exercises the mind.  I enjoy the puzzles.  I play it daily when I can find the time.  It is well worth the cost.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This series is excellent - the pilot, the acting, the directing...if you like British crime, this is a must see....
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I always was a bingo player and enjoy playing on my android.  Easy to follow the numbers and everything else that is going on, but it is hard to get a bingo.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Fantastic cinematography captures primeval forests and world of eighteenth century colonial America. Wonderful chemistry between Stowe and and Day-Lewis. Fascinating, romantic story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun and easy. Good graphics I like to play this with my children and let them tell me how to escape.
B005LAIII0|2.0|Beautiful movie reflective of a phenomenal book. Stunning visuals in HD; however, the iTunes digital copy is only in standard definition without Extras. Fox really needs to catch up with the other studios.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I started reading this because you can't be critical of what you don't know.  Once I got started it was hard to put down. I didn't like that children are the subject of national punishment, but it was well played. Now I am trying to decide if I will continue to the next book. It seems a must.
B005LAII44|3.0|If your expecting a continuence of flavor from the first GI Joe, forget it it's not gonna happen. This is more of a pure military correct movie..... entertaining? Yes! But not what I expected from the JOES
B007BVOEPI|5.0|it;s full f twist and turns. You never know what is goin to happen next and I'm looking forward to the next season.
B00C7E3ELE|4.0|If your a true vidiophile your going to love Adreanne Barbeau in this first production of &#34;The Fog.&#34; I've seen the remake and it's a waste of time.... but I must say this is a true Cult Classic.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest because it has so many things on it that others have posted and it gives you great ideas.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Outstanding acting from Morgan Freeman, Academy Award-winner Tim Robbins (Mystic River, The Hudsucker Proxy) stars in this Oscar-nominated drama about a banker who is wrongly convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover.<br />Even though it's close to 2 1/2 hours long I didn't want it to end.<br />The Academy blew it by not giving this an Oscar
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Big numbers, perfect for when you want to calculate something quick, has all the functions you need.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|The product was in good shape and fantastic 3-D.  The movie? Well you can decide, the witches left a lot to be wanting in their acting.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Easy to use.  One of the best.  Can play for hours.  The tiles can be seen quickly.  I love it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The most useful app I have....definitely an excellent tool!<br />Easy to read numbers and performs all the operations anyone could need.<br />So helpful and easy to use.
0316044938|5.0|The book was delivered on time and in good condition.<br />The book is well written and enjoyable resding<br />The subject is somewhat gruesome but the characyers are interesting.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|Excelent device to record my voice, you only need connect by USB port in your computer and start your favorite program to record
B00DOQK2OG|5.0|Essential for die hard Blackmore fans. This is my second favorite Rainbow line-up (after the Rising era one,) so I may be a bit biased. It's nice to finally get live versions of the \\"Stranger In Us All\\" tracks on a legit release.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Phillip Phillips has done a great job!  A little reminiscent of Dave Matthews... but that's not necessarily a bad thing!  I'm enjoying this CD thoroughly!
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|I am not, nor have I ever been, that terribly into Sigur Ros; interesting because I do love post-rock bands and do generally enjoy spacing out while listening to Sigur Ros... for me this album was amazing.  Probably one of the best things they've done.<br /><br />Right away, I sensed it was much darker than previous work and seemed conceptually more bound.  I am going to be seeing them for the first time next month, and I am really excited for that.  Hopefully they play a lot of the tracks from this record because the entire album is really great.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved this book because it is a reminder that it is never too late to follow your personal legend.  It also points out that reaching one's personal legend is as much about the journey as it is the objective.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has given up on a dream due to frustration.  This is a fable strongly capable of restoring hope.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Good story good cast and a little off beat a nice movie. To watch  for. An evening  entertainment  at an inexpensive price
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Terrific writing and well documented.  The author has a knack of putting the reader in the action.  It was a book I could not put down.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I read some reader reviews of the book and unfortunately one of them gave away a key element of the story that the author did not reveal until midway through the book.  So that review was a spoiler.  I felt the book was a sermon wrapped in a story; I prefer persuasive and philosophical discourse in newspapers and non-fiction - not in novels.
B0067R0APK|1.0|P.O.S. @$$app is for those who think it'll make you feel like you'd want to be signing in the rain. Never @$$accurate at all. Show raining for the day, but dry ass. Never refresh temp display, have to follow it yourself. Try others!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Such a great book; a sensitive and moving tale of an evolving relationship between a young woman and a quadriplegic.  Not only was the story compelling but it provokes a lot of thought on the quality of a life lived with a major disability.  To say more would spoil the story.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It is light weight, tight fit and smooth. The cover is fits so well on the kindle its like there is not one at all.
B008SAZHLQ|2.0|Some reader reviews said the book was great for adults even though it was written for teens and young adults.  I had a different experience.  I could not get through more than about 10 rather tedious chapters of  &#34;young love&#34;.  Really not the author's fault; it is probably great for preteen girls.
B009MXSWI8|4.0|after many years and forgot how rough it was. I still LOVE it, but Evil Dead 2 being a more refined version of the same story is just a more enjoyable experience. But this movie brings back so many great memories of my youth. 4 Stars!
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars hits all the right notes. Despite being categorized as a YA book, it's for everyone.  I'm a 53 year-old man with cancer who can completely relate to the characters and their situation. As an author myself, I'm so jealous of what Green has achieved. The humor, pathos and love story work perfectly. Read it and you won't regret it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|As soon as I saw the pilot I knew I loved this show! Great action, and just the right amount of drama. Two thumbs up to the writers!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Awesome. Best studio documentary I have ever seen. Definitely worth watching if you are a music fan. Go watch it now!
B004GYY714|5.0|I can now stream the kind of music I like-jazz and classical-while I work and at home I can place my kindle where ever I am and not disturb anyone around me.  It is pretty cool!
1451626096|3.0|I'm not going to go into the preamble of what led to this book. There are plenty other other reviews out there that have done that. I'm going to simply give my opinion of the story I finished last night (8/28/13). I'm not a huge Philippa Gregory fan (I lean more towards Alison Weir), but the War of the Roses intrigued me and I started with the first book. Out of the 5 books in the series, this was the most disappointing. I found Princess (future Queen) Elizabeth to not have enough backbone for my liking. I tried to keep the period in mind (women to be bedded and not heard), but from the previous book, she seemed to have had more of a \\"I'll do what I want and don't care what you think\\" attitude than she had now. Of course, she was younger in the previous books and she's married to the king who doesn't love or trust her and she's trying to do as she's told and expected. But, I didn't buy it. Some of the most enjoyable parts were when Dowager Queen Elizabeth verbally sparred with \\"My Lady, the King's Mother.\\" Unfortunately, there weren't enough of those. I enjoyed Princess/Queen Elizabeth's relationship with her cousin Maggie (the future Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, who will eventually be brutally executed by Henry VIII... personally, she's the character I had the most sympathy for knowing how her life will end. Maybe that would be an interesting story?). Margaret Beaufort has been, for the most part, a woman I cannot identify with or feel much for, except to say that her zealot beliefs created the 'monster' her son became (or so the book leads us to believe). It has been a long time, so long that I can't remember, when I have disliked and reviled a character as much as Ms. Gregory's interpretation of Henry VII. A brain washed, momma's boy with a severe bi-polar and paranoia disorder. Again, I tried hard to keep in mind what his life was like and what he had to go through, but the character is such an ass that I quickly lost any sympathy I may have had. WhileI knew he outlived his wife, I kept wishing someone would kill him off. I cannot for the life of me believe her interpretation of his character is any where near the truth. Other articles I have read have agreed they did not marry for love (and Arthur was born 8 months after the marriage; rape? early birth? who knows..), but he came to trust her insight and was seriously grieved when she died. Reading this book, I have a hard time believing it. He didn't know who, or what, he loved or trusted, except the mother he barely knew until he was an adult. ***SPOILER****  I had *assumed* the book would end with Elizabeth's death. When it ends with him whining to her about \\"doing the right thing\\" and whether she forgave him...(and she does, again, really?!?) I kept turning the pages to see where the rest of the story was. How did they end up having another child (her dying due to that child's birth) with his \\"do I/don't I love/trust you\\" attitude and his severe infatuation with the Lady Katherine? I'm not sure I can tell you what I expected, but this wasn't it. I'm not disappointed I bought it (on a 50% off sale) as it completes the series, but it was a disappointing read in both ending and characters. I'm hoping Alison Weir's book on the same lady coming out later this year will shed a better light on who this woman was, how she conducted herself and her relationships with her blood and married family.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot. Could envision each character and felt like they were real folks. Nice story, with many ending s.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Never knew how much I missed while it was airing. I love mixture of tech and sci fi in this.
B000089RV6|5.0|What can you say about an album that's been a staple at college parties for over 3 decades...  This album defines what it is to &#34;Rock&#34;<br /><br />(Two more words are required to submit this review, so thanks to Amazon here is some useless text)
B00BMUL2WW|5.0|LUDIVICO has tapped into the realm of the Divine. His Music is Godly. If ever get to see him in concert you will be blessed!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is by far one of the worse books I've read in a long time.  The characters were totally unbelievable.  I was never convinced of the reality of the action throughout the entire book.  The characters were unlikeable and the behavior of all of them was completely unrealistic.  From the husband  to the wife to her parents and all the other characters - I could not fathom why they behaved as they did.  You couldn't possibly believe the wife was dead, you couldn't possibly believe the husband's reactions were even remotely reasonable, you couldn't possibly believe the parents blew away all their money and then so nonchalantly ask the wife for her trust fund money.  I could go on and on.  Nonsensical story!  Can't believe people thought the book had any validity.  It had to be the shock factor that numbed readers brains because the actions just didn't add up. Any man who would even consider allowing this insane person to be the mother of his child isn't too tightly wrapped himself.  A shocker, but so far-fetched it wasn't worth the time it took to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The disk was shipped overnight and received in good condition. We like the show so much we watched the entire season in two nights. So - I guess that makes us addicts
B000V8A95C|4.0|what more could i add? it's a fun show, based off a great book, based off a beloved childhood memory. i have a soft spot for I&K, but the music in general is just fun.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We were hooked on this series just watching the first episode of the first season. We don't have cable or TV service to our home so this DVD set is a welcome addition to our collecton.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The remake of Gatsby is visually stunning.  The Tiffany jewelry, chandeliers, blowing white curtains and winding staircase are the stuff of imagination.  The twenties at their peak.  The acting however, and the screenplay failed to fulfill this magnificent book.  De Caprio is not Redford; for the better part of the movie he sounds as though he is trying to speak like a Kennedy.  He finally comes into the character in the last scenes, and in those, is really good.  Toby McGuire is vacant; without the writing tool used in the movie he has no personality at all.  Carey Mulligan is a picture of Daisy; the depth of character and beginnings of her madness are not there.  She never has those 'Zelda'  moments which gave meaning to her part in the story.  The best character in this version is Jordan; Isla Fischer is beautiful and conveys her character, the times, everything with only few words; in her facial expression and movement there is a true depth that draws attention.  Found myself wanting to hear more from her.  The story is lost.  There is no mention or appearance of Daisy's child at all until the last; one is left wondering where she came from and when, unless you know the book.  The best part of the screenplay is the use of Fitzgerald's amazing closing lines and the green light......  Because I love the book, I liked the movie; if Redford, Farrow, and even Edward Hermann playing the twenties era piano were in this production it would be amazing!  Only a 'like' for content. An exceptional visual for those who love the twenties.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does everything I need it todo. Can use your own music that is on your Kindle. Multiple alarms can be made and used.
1476733953|5.0|So much detail! The only disappointment was the ending: it felt rushed and kind of just... petered out. BUT, I didn't know it was part of a trilogy! So yay!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|HE LOVES THE OLD SONG WRITERS AND THIS HAS A SOUND HE ENJOYS WITH THE DRUMS.! A MUSICAL SUCCESS WITH A BRUSH SOUND ON THE DRUMS.!
B00DW39B2K|3.0|This movie is a 2 person survival movie in the wilderness. Nice scenery but the John Travolta character is just so annoying - a terrible accent and tar black hair dye. It is OK just to pass the time if you are bored.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I set the app to update my weather info hourly - the slowest rate available, and instead it would do so every 12-24 hours... absolutely useless.  Removed from my phone forthwith.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|a little to gory for l like scary makes you jump type of movies. is ok . the kids liked it
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A love story with many elements: illusions, magic, chocolate mice, betrayal, fate and faith. Wonderfully descriptive and entertaining. If you believe in love and magic and can envision a fantasy world built to delight the senses, then you will love the Night Circus.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|loved it. really required me to remember sequences and colors.would like to see more puzzles that require you to figure out the next sequence or perform math calculations
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I like them for being in different colors.. its easy to remember the settings by color... i recommend this product... writing to it is fast...
B008LA7RM0|4.0|I've seen on so many sites that this is the definitive Beach Boys - but I'm not really sure about that.  Part of it is a mono-version of their other albums and another is stereo and kind of iffy.  I'm just not seeing it...  I grew up in their era and knew about the drugs, etc. but the Beach Boys at their peak was one thing ... this isn't that.  Rather than spending your $$$ on this, get one of the classics that's been re-mastered.  It's a better buy.
B00A4AIYHW|4.0|Super soft and cuddly. My 7 year old loves it. A little pricey for the size but it is cute and well made.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and relaxing game. Not hard to understand yet challenges the mind.  I really like it.  Great for kids to do on a road trip.
1452000247|5.0|Loved this tale! Brilliantly thought out, well told story with just enough darkness to keep it interesting. Great imagery!<br /><br />Keep an eye out for William O'Brien, can't wait for his next book!
1451627297|5.0|This is one of King's best recent works, it combines light science fiction with a gripping story, and heartfelt emotion. A fine read that grips you until the end.
B000002GOZ|3.0|She the friend lost hers and she wanted a new one and I found it. Just like the one lost.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great, quick read.  I found myself reading at all hours of the night, anxious to discover what awaited Katniss at each new leg of her Hunger Games journey.  Well-written and compelling for adults and youth alike. Even if you have seen the movie already this book will not disappoint! Now I'm off to download \\"Catching Fire.\\"
B0058VW36U|5.0|it is the best game ever it is awesome super fun if you are looking for a game that is fun for both kids and adults this is the one
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Doctor who Is Amazing At All Times. David Tennant Is An Amazingly Talented Actor Who Brings Flair And Emotion. Love Love Love!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|These sold quick and it was hard to get one.  It is a great device for the price paid for it.  However, it often seems limited, but still something to have.
B002BRRTUO|4.0|I remember watching this when it came out, and remember the yellow covered Queen soundtrack album.  We wore out a couple of the tunes.  Great to revisit this.  Campy, and real run. We loved watching it again.
B004132HZS|5.0|Love this version of Sherlock and Watson. there's just something very appealing about these episodes of sherlock. Excellent production. Excellent acting.
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing.  I leave it on my coffee table, and my friends constantly look through it admiring the artwork.
B004D2CPO0|5.0|\\"Beat\\" Takeshi Kitano's latest, \\"Outrage Beyond\\", a sequel to 2010's Yakuza thriller \\"Outrage\\" delivers the goods better than any Kitano film since \\"Zatoichi.\\" I won't get into the plot or the characters too much, you really need to see these two films in order with as little knowledge as possible to enhance your enjoyment to the maximum.<br /><br />If you are addicted to the American-style of vapid, meaningless shoot-em-up gangster films, then this film isn't for you.<br /><br />But if you are a connoisseur of the perfect meshing of art and entertainment and violence (with a not-so-subtle message about declining tradition and the changes in (gangster) society that this results in), and if you are a Kitano fan, get ready for a thrill ride that you'll hope won't end.<br /><br />A thumbnail of the features that make this film an undeniable Kitano classic follows below. (Like the finest chocolate cake, this film is meant to be SAVORED, minute-by-minute, rather than devoured like, oh, say, Tarantino's over-the-top cartoon-like-violence flicks).<br /><br />1. The characters - they are absolutely dead-on, the acting is excellent and there are a number of supporting characters not central to the action (two mob underbosses) who are so enjoyable to watch that they practically steal every scene they are in. This is character acting at it absolute finest. Like all of Kitano's serious films, (and Japanese films in general from my experience), there is a rich STORY here and myriad plots and sub-plots that have to be carefully followed to fully understand what is happening. A movie that engages your mind - what a concept! Once you get to know the characters - the empty suits, the curmudgeonly wisemen, the self-deluding fools, and the absolutely execrably vile schemers and assassins, then it is time to get the show really started.<br /><br />2. The violence - like all of Kitano's films, the violence is understated but MUCH more personal than in a Tarantino shoot-em-up. When someone gets shot or stabbed in a Kitano film, YOU squirm with discomfort, which is exactly what Kitano wants you to do. He makes you FEEL the violence. (Remember the scene in \\"Violent Cop\\" where Takeshi takes an assassin's knife away from him by grabbing the blade - only to have to slowly extract it from his heavily bleeding, seemingly paralyzed clenched fist after making his getaway?) As a bonus, there are two new ways that Kitano devises to get rid of particularly traitorous, odious stooges that are both shocking and laugh-out-loud-hilarious at the same time. You'll have to see the film and I guarantee you won't have to wonder which scenes I am talking about.<br /><br />3. The ending. To me, this film has the hands-down best, most satisfying, ending of any Kitano film. It is a surprise ending, much like the ending of \\"Violent Cop\\" was unexpected. Except that in this case it will make you jump on your couch and pump your fist into the air as you yell \\"Yeah! YEAAAHHHH!!!\\" I promise you, it will not disappoint.<br /><br />After seeing this artistic, almost-Shakespearean Yakuza \\"film noir\\" masterpiece, you'll be clamoring for Takeshi to make the final film of the rumored trilogy, so that you and your friends can all get together in a few years in front of a 70-inch flat screen HD TV and have a back-to-back-to-back \\"Outrage Film Festival\\" of your own.ne gets shot or stabbed in a Kitano film, YOU squirm with discomfort, which is exactly what Kitano wants you to do. He makes you FEEL the violence. (Remember the scene in \\"Violent Cop\\" where Takeshi takes an assassin's knife away from him by grabbing the blade - only to have to slowly extract it from his heavily bleeding, seemingly paralyzed clenched fist after making his getaway?) As a bonus, there are two new ways that Kitano devises to get rid of particularly traitorous, odious stooges that are both shocking and laugh-out-loud-hilarious at the same time. You'll have to see the film and I guarantee you won't have to wonder which scenes I am talking about.<br /><br />3. The ending. To me, this film has the hands-down best, most satisfying, ending of any Kitano film. It is a surprise ending, much like the ending of \\"Violent Cop\\" was unexpected. Except that in this case it will make you jump on your couch and pump your fist into the air as you yell \\"Yeah! YEAAAHHHH!!!\\" I promise you, it will not disappoint.<br /><br />After seeing this artistic, almost-Shakespearean Yakuza \\"film noir\\" masterpiece, you'll be clamoring for Takeshi to make the final film of the rumored trilogy, so that you and your friends can all get together in a few years in front of a 70-inch flat screen HD TV and have a back-to-back-to-back \\"Outrage Film Festival\\" of your own.

B005LAIIN0|4.0|Let me get two things straight:<br /><br />1. World War Z (the movie) is not a masterpiece.<br /><br />2. It is nothing like the book.<br /><br />And because it's a movie and not entirely based on the book, I watched and critiqued it without comparing the two. That wouldn't make sense since this story is completely different, and about the only things they share are the zombies and title.<br /><br />So, here are the pros of the movie:<br /><br />PRO: Brad Pitt -- I know a lot of people thing his acting is wooden and he's overrated, but I think his acting in this movie is very good. He is natural and nuanced, giving a performance that really boosts the movie's value overall.<br /><br />PRO: The Opening Sequence (SPOILERS) -- My friends and I agreed that the opening sequence has us hooked. The action doesn't start 5 seconds into the movie. First we get a glimpse into the simplicity of this family's life. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a father who is driving his family through the traffic-ridden streets of downtown. And that's when the invasion hits (at least for them). We see people running for their lives as others get killed and mauled down, and eventually converted into zombies. And we also see what these zombies are like. They're fast, mindless undead creatures that resemble those from 28 Days Later. It's less believable, but the notion of zombies doesn't make the most sense either. But great opening scene with thrilling action.<br /><br />PRO: The Middle Act (SPOILERS) -- We see the middle-east, South Korea (woot!), and more, so the change of scenery is nice. But what makes this world-roaming great is the suspenseful action that follows Lane wherever he goes. In search of answers, he treks the globe and makes discoveries that aren't obtained easily. One moment in particular impressed me-- when the Israeli boy was untouched by the rushing, manic waves of zombies. That kept me wondering why they weren't harming him.<br /><br />Now for the things that prevented this movie from being one hell of a zombie action movie.<br /><br />CON: The Drastic Tonal Shift in the Final Act -- Wow. I was told that the movie's ending was re-shot and that it wasn't the most tonally fitting; I doubted this rumor. Then I saw it and said, \\"damn, you were freaking right.\\" While the rest of the movie, including the beginning, is action-packed and thrilling, the ending is a slow sneaking game that doesn't seem suitable for the ending. I wish earlier sections of the movie had more suspense to build up to this one extremely suspenseful act. This ending isn't bad by any means, but in context with the rest of the movie, the tone is off.<br /><br />CON: Here's a short list of minor things that bugged me: lack of compelling characters, conventional action moments, and lack of truly gripping suspense.<br /><br />Overall, it's quite a good movie, just not amazing. 4/5 stars
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|just love this game and also the chance to play against others. The main disappointment at present is that when you purchase power shots they now come in multiples of 20 instead of 2, not good if you do not have the points to get them
0785132619|5.0|After watching the Kick-Ass (again) and Kick-Ass 2 movies, I thought that I should check out the source material, and I'm really happy that I did. The art here is excellent, and the story makes much more sense than what they used for the movie. I was surprised how different the stories were, even how sometimes the complete opposite thing happened from book to movie. I'd say that the story for the movie was definitely Hollywoodified, and in some ways they made the story better, but in others the comic book really shines in comparison. Overall, I really enjoyed this graphic novel, and I look forward to reading the sequels.
B00E193TM2|5.0|After being badgered by my friend for a month i finally gave in and downloaded the album.  I'm not a FFDP fan at all.

B005974CNA|2.0|I love Dream Theater. I think they are fantastic. I have been a fan since 1994 when I saw Lie on Headbangers Ball. I check out the Dream Theater forums everyday but I am not a member (because especially after writing this, they may not be too happy). This album is the first huge disappointment in their career. I know people thought that Systematic Chaos and BCASL were let downs but to me, those were top tier albums. On this album, all the dynamics of the music are gone and they played it safe. I am by no means a Portnoy fan boy but his vocals countered James nicely in the last few albums. This album goes from embarassingly bad cheesy ballads (This Is The Life) to songs that are derervative of other higher quality songs (Breaking All Illusions which can't hold a candle to Learning To Live). I give it two stars because there is some good in here but its very few and far between moments. I even saw them on this tour and found it to be dreadfully boring....but theres a side story to that so it may have just been me at the time not enjoying it. However, I am looking forward to the new album in a few weeks and hope its a brilliant comeback. Mangini is an awesome drummer but bring back the band dynamics.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love it.  Kindle sit right next to bed so it perfect and not annoying like a regular alarm clock.  Ours is set to get louder if we don't wake up. I also like the options of sounds to wake up with.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Florence Welch reminds me of Annie Lennox and Sarah McLachlan with her voice.<br />Her haunting vocals and melodious instruments from the band (the Machine) make<br />this album.  Favorites are What the Water Gave me, Only for a Night, Shake it<br />out, Never Let Me Go, No light, No Light, Seven Devils, Lover to Lover and<br />Leave My Body.  If you love Florence Welch, buy this album!  Try out the Lungs<br />album too!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I love Khaled Hosseini's books.  They bring you into the centre of the Afghanistan culture of the past and of today.  I really felt sorry that the brother and sister met up when it was too late but I guess that is life.  I am looking forward to another book from this author.

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Played through level 35 in first sitting.  Seems simple at first but it really requires strategy and thinking ahead!  I like the redo feature.  It would be nice to have a template of the scoring (1 redo subtracts x number of points).  I like this a lot!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have read many a book, but none have led me further down the rabbit hole than this.  The writing was seductive drawing me into the circus wishing that I could step under Herr's magnificent clock and explore the twisting paths of the circus.  I have been made a dreamer.  I dreaded finding the end every time I turned a page, yet hungered for more; and it ultimately left me more than satisfied tying up the loose ends, yet leaving room for the mind to explore the possibilities of the stories future.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it is a pretty good app considering kindle fire but the device do sucks if you compare it with ipad.<br />the kindle.doesn't have a clock of its own.So this.is highly recommended.<br />I like waking up in the forming with my favourite song.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My grandson who is 7 loves this game. We work together escaping each floor. Have to do a lot of thinking and looking to solve the key to escape.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy and Mark Greaney have put together one of the scariest modern thrillers I have read in a very long time. This story seems to reflect the news headlines of today.
B007MDB71O|5.0|There were some excellent movies that came out in 2012, from the historical treatments of \\"Argo\\" and \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" to the spirited action of \\"Skyfall,\\" \\"The Dark Knight Rises,\\" and \\"The Avengers.\\"  However, none brought to life a more freshly imagined world than \\"John Carter of Mars.\\"  I became a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs as a teen after reading \\"Tarzan of the Apes.  Eventually, I read his entire Martian series -- and wished that there had been more.<br /><br />So, I was excited when it was announced that Disney was bringing the series to the big screen.  But after seeing the first trailers, I was worried that it would be a huge disappointment.  As a result, I tried to go into the theater with an open mind.<br /><br />The first scenes out West had me shaking my head.  This did not seem like the gallant former Confederate officer from Virginia that I had expected.  But then we eventually (though painfully) made it to Mars.  The scenes where Carter learned how to walk in the low Martian gravity kicked in the empathy levels.  Finally, the audience was intrigued.  The fantastic images and situations were soon coming fast and furious.  The characters were strongly developed (a rare treat of late).<br /><br />Unlike me, no one else in the theater had read the books, but everyone was enthralled with the epic that was developing before our eyes.  There were several plot changes from the book, but the director made them work to his advantage.  By the time the movie had finished, we were all enchanted.<br /><br />I ended up seeing the movie twice in the theater and bought the Blu-Ray as soon as it came out.  I was impressed with the actors, the script, the special effects, and the richness of the score.  The drama had an emotional impact and was moving in many ways, even keeping in mind that this John Carter is more of a New Age hero than a traditional one.<br /><br />Looking back, the ad campaign was horrific.  Never once was the connection drawn to the source material in any meaningful way.  Edgar Rice Who?  Nobody came to see the movie because they did not know what it was.  Disney abandoned it as if it was \\"The Black Cauldron.\\"<br /><br />The movie is a gem, and I can only hope that the same team can get together for a sequel.  Without question, \\"John Carter of Mars\\" gave us the most fantastic world of 2012.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|The constant fear of wondering when the bad guys are going to surface keeps this movie interesting start to finish. Like Tom Sawyer for the 2010s...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written description of the politics and culture of palestine at that time. A well rounded effort in describing the life and death ofJesus in secular terms. I am glad I read this book.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works great , I would recommend this app to anyone that needs a reliable alarm clock,It has great features and if you don't like ads it's only $1.00,for the no ads version.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Must be a very good book club selection as there is so much that can be discussed.<br />Wasn't sure I was going to like it at first but it soon took hold and I hurried through it.  Yes, it is a very good read but a little silly at times (a walk across England in boat shoes??  Really!).

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Games super awesome great way to kill time when waiting for anything. Good buy in my opinion. Nothing better than a few games of substituted.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Picked this up at the Apple store when they showed it had the additional feature of capturing my pulse.  Whole interface is accessed via push button switch and touch sensitive screen.  You can see your steps taken (10k default daily goal), altitude (using barometric pressure so stair stepping machines won't register), miles/kilometers traversed (very inaccurate and can't be calibrated), your calories burned, any runs you've done (you have to run fast for 1 minute for it to start tracking). a default clock with a battery indicator (can go over a week on a micro USB charge) and your name.  You also get a touch screen choice for pulse and sleep.  Pulse requires you to pull it out of it's case and lightly put on your finger.  In my case the first reading is always high (like 160) and the second reading is accurate at around 65.  The sleep mode doesn't show you any data, but when you sync it shows up on your smartphone app Withings.<br /><br />My biggest concern that this is only water resistant while in it's clip case.  If just loose in your pocket the water will get into the pulse port and the USB port.  Do prefer the Fit Bit's clip approach as opposed to the Withings requiring a rubber case clip or wrist band (wrist band only for sleeping). Also Fit Bit has a wake alarm, which pulse doesn't.<br /><br />The app has a clean UI, but it showcases the other withings products they want to upsell you on to track everything else (scale, blood pressure monitor, etc).  Still using it a week later and it works for me.  Expect to have to struggle through a firmware update delay (like over an hour in my case) as part of the out of box experience.
B008133MDK|5.0|I'm in love with Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. Now add that it's a Steven Moffit production and you've got the best. The whole cast brings I intrigue and humor. Thank you Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson and Mark Gatiss as Mycroft Holmes.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|The idea that we don't have to settle for having things get worse and having more things blown up<br />is a nice one. The idea that with our technology we can turn deserts<br />into green and crop yielding areas isn't new, but since the 30's<br />the visionary ideals have been harder to find<br />and those willing to have them less resolute?<br />Here an English professor is reluctantly converted to a project<br />for seeding a new species into the Arabian area rivers of Yemen.<br />The British won't give up their 10000 Salmon and it goes to a fish farmer<br />who raises them for the table to supply the fish.<br />That bad men are too often allowed to poison our wells<br />seems to be a given in a world of negative religion and<br />building CO2? That hope is just a thought away<br />is the beauty of this movie with the most unlikely of heroes.

B009RX7WTI|5.0|This is a really good TV series.  I love all the stories that go on during the season.  Good actors in this series.  I like it so much that I have every season on DVD!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|At first, I hesitated to buy the book and thought it might just be one of those business celebrity books. But, Sheryl Sandberg did her research and used plenty of both academic data and real stories of her friends' and herself's to make a point--we need and we must have more women leaders. Even for a girl who always believes she can do at least as good as boys, I was shocked when I read how women ourselves pulled the peers down and how important to have a supportive life partner. Mentality matters! Not only women, but men should really take a look at how they treat men and women colleagues and leaders differently. The biggest ignorance is ignorance itself. So only when we admit that we still have a long way to achieve the expected equal economic and social power between men and women,can women females strive and the society boom as a whole.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Watched the entire season in just a few days. I grew to care about the characters. Really a great series.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Given that the viewer &#34;buys into&#34; the Myth, this was a reasonably intelligently done script with a 'believable' plot. The actors were very good and did their lines well and consistently. I would likely watch it again in the future, which is unusual for me.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have been in love with Downton Abbey since I first saw it on PBS! This set did not disappoint. I did not notice any extend scenes like some have said, but the special features are wonderful still
0385345054|5.0|WOW! I received this book today, and was completely stunned. I'm going to echo the other reviewers and say it is worth way more than the retail price. It's a gorgeous hardcover with absolutely beautiful photos on every. single. page. I'm actually a photographer, so I'm a bit of a photography snob sometimes.. and I was thoroughly impressed with every photo. The projects range from adorable to stunning, and I can't wait to get started! I love how each project lists what they were inspired by, as well as some suggestions for making the project your own. Seriously in love with this book!
030758836X|3.0|Torn between rating the book 3 or 4 stars.  If I could, I would give it a 3.5.  I read two books prior to this that declared in reviews that they were &#34;Gone Girl&#34; like.  I enjoyed both books and the unconventional plot, so I decided to finally read the book well known enough to allude to in other book reviews as if it summed up the plot.  I really did enjoy the book initially.  The first 50%, I thought I determined who the unreliable narrator was and how it was going to end.  Yes, I thought I was that smart.  I was wrong.  The book and certain characters threw me for a loop, a loop I ranger enjoyed and was waiting for the climatic ta-da ending. It never came.  It just ended and ended with a lot of disappointment on my end.  Anticlimactic ending.  The steam found in the first 75% of the book disappeared in the last 25%.
B00CNIDGVW|4.0|I love Sci-Fi movies...this one was quite enjoyable, especially with Matthew Broderick leading the cast.  Loved the scene in MSG.
B001NLL93W|4.0|You would think that after two full-length novels, Clary would have, at the very least, found a way to wake her mom, but that is just not the case.  The third book in the Mortal Instruments series starts with Clary going on another quest to find a warlock by the name of Ragnor Fell who can wake her mother up.  Then there is always the added plot of finding a way to defeat Valentine, which eventually seeps in.<br /><br />I have to say that after reading this, though I intend to finish the entire series eventually, I cannot imagine it ended better than this did.  Everything ties up in a neat little bow, giving everyone a happy ending...well, everyone who is still alive gets a happy ending.  Therein lies the problem.<br /><br />My first issue with this was the deaths.  Yes, the war with Valentine has been bloody and there has been no skimping on the character deaths before this novel, but there was one that I found intolerable. The deaths alone bring the star rating down.  If a certain character had lived, I would have given it five, but I'm so freaking tired of pointless character deaths, in books, movies, and shows, that I just cannot give it five stars.<br /><br />On the whole, the novel was just as enthralling and enchanting as the other two, with good writing, witty dialogue, and a big enough mystery to keep you guessing until the very end.  I knew that the sibling issue between Clary and Jace would finally be revealed and I must say that I didn't see the way it played out coming.  Some plot twists were a bit more transparent, but not one really got me, so bravo Clare, bravo.<br /><br />I think my two favorite things about this was finally getting Jocelyn's history, from her perspective and all the couples finally getting together.  The biggest is Clary and Jace finally being able to be together without feeling like it is an abomination.  Jace really stole the show in this one, in my opinion.  The way he confesses his love, despite everything else, and the speech he gives to Clary at the end was just...wow.  I love Jace and though I know many people were against Jamie Campbell Bower being cast as him, I think he's perfect for the role and exceedingly pretty, so bite me.  Back to my original point, I loved that the main couples do end up together.<br /><br />This novel is an excellent conclusion to the storyline of the first three novels.  I don't know what the main conflict of the next three will be but I can say definitively that if you don't like longer series, you can legitimately stop here and not be left wanting.  As for me?  I am planning on reading the next three, but I'll be treading lightly because the longer a series continues, the more opportunity there is for it to go south.  Wish me luck!he gives to Clary at the end was just...wow.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book! It was even better than city of bones! I could not put it down! Can't wait for city of glass!
B00284BNKC|4.0|strange but awesome movie I wanted for my collection. Now if I can find the movie spun to go with it, its  a perfect odd film set
0060763280|5.0|A must read. If you are student of success like me this book needs to be in your collection. I even have it on audio. You will not be millionaire after you read it that takes time. But you will think differently about money.
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|The movie was all scratched up so the movie would skip parts all the time. No one ever got back to me about rectifying this problem!  Terrible service!!!
B00BHU261S|5.0|Did not know very much about Alfred Hitchcock, but always enjoyed his movies.  This movie gives insight into his personal life as well as his struggles in the dog-eat-dog world of Hollywood!!!  Would highly recommend if you are a Hitchcock fan.  Anthony is great as always!
140006922X|5.0|While most of the new testament doesn't really fit into neat little overlapping stories that agree with one another, the book Zealot offers an alternative view that seems, at least to me, to be a real possibility of what might have happened in reality but was &#34;covered up&#34; by made-up stories that would produce a Savior rather than just another irrate zealot. I, like the author, Reza Aslan, was a &#34;true&#34; believer as a Southern Baptist until I read the Bible critically. I try to be neutral but Zealot seems to make a lot of sense.
159562015X|5.0|There are many personality tests that are offered through various sources.  The test offered through the purchase of Strengths Finder is an inexpensive means to help you determine personal character strengths.  The book offers 34 themes that are adequately separate from each other to be identifiable in a testing environment.  The test will narrow down the 5 key strengths that your answers generate.  The print out the test generates helps you see how your answers generated the conclusions.  This print out also gives you meaningful areas to focus on so as to build these strengths and improve your life satisfaction.  I enjoyed the process and recommend it.
B0038QN2AS|4.0|One of those books that are hard to put away once you started reading.<br /><br />Especially fascinating because the building blocks for this near future fiction are already there (not quite when Suarez wrote the book, but today with Google Glass and PRISM, the future he describes feels really just round the corner)<br /><br />A bit too much colorful and detailed martial violence for my taste, but that didn't spoil the nifty multi-threaded plot at all.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|BBC did it again! Loved every episode. The cast was great, and it is truly a great series about family values and the importance of friendship. One for the whole family.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|Compared to the really fascinating &#34;Daemon&#34; + &#34;Freedom TM&#34;, &#34;Kill decision&#34; covers an equally interesting and very important and worthwhile to think about topic (autonomous drones), but in my opinion it lacks a convincing story.<br />Maybe it's my limited capacity in fascination with martial scenery that made this book just an entertaining read, but without really diving into the atmosphere of the story like I was able to with &#34;Daemon&#34; and &#34;Freedom TM&#34;.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|I love this game u should try it!  If u like drag racing u will like this game  u also get cool cars

B00CJGP116|4.0|At first I didn't like 3.0 at all, and my avowed anti-Sergio George mindset probably influenced me.(Although he does done some very good work, in general I do not consider him one of the best salsa arrangers).<br /><br />As others have said, the bar was set very high by Mark's 3 legendary albums of the past, and expectations, after 10 long years, are impossibly high. Libre, especially, has a unique quality to it that sets it apart.<br /><br />However, with repeated hearings the quality of 3.0 has revealed itself, and I think you will enjoy it more if you just take it for what it is and not make comparisons.  Sergio George has done some of his best work, the songs are all highly tuneful, and Marc's singing has truly never been more spectacular, sealing his reputation as one of the great Latin singers of the day.<br /><br />The best tracks are the first four, and La Copa Ropa.  My favorite is Cambio de Piel - a song I can't get out of my head. And La Copa Rota leads me to wish Marc would do a whole album of this old music, his singing and interpretation are simply flawless.<br /><br />Tracks 7-9, while not quite as engaging as the others, are still very good. The only song I could do without is Espera, which seems rather routine to me, and the \\"pop\\" version of Vivir mi Vida is not necessary.<br /><br />I do wish that after 10 years we could have a had a longer album.<br /><br />My other complaint is the really bad pics of Marc all over the CD and booklet. Come on!  Has anybody seen the gorgeous pics of him at Kohl's Department Store?! The cover looks like a mug shot!

B00BEXB18M|4.0|Let's call it a flat B-.  There are some good songs on here, but there are no great songs.  The real plus is that it's far more listenable than Thirteen which was really an awful record.  I think if this was Megadeth's first release after Endgame, I'd have given it 2 or 3 stars.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Movie was packed with action scenes back to back. I love marvel movies and comic books. This movie deff delivered great performances!! Would highly recommend it.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just when you really get in to the game, it's over. Hopefully they'll update it with more levels soon. Looking forward to it.
1476734941|4.0|The book and the video gave me a lot to think about since I have some health problems. I feel good on this.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|This book had a rather slow start, but once I got into it I had to finish. The abuse is very graphic, but was portrayed truthfully and accurately depicted a physically/verbally/emotionally/sexually abusive relationship in all its wickedness. I expected more out of the story in regards to the ending.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I started this game like 5 times ...some times to make better moves sometimes its got frozzen and didnt want restart for many days so i hope this time i will see how far its will go...i do like the game...we will see whats coming next

B00DU74U74|4.0|I loved the book, and couldn't wait to see the movie, of course the book has a lot more detail and more stories, and the relationship take time to happen. Everything is faster in the movie, as it is in most movies based on book, but non the less it was an amazing movie, very touching and emotional, a story of survival and instinct. VERY WORTH WATCHING!

B00915G6MG|5.0|I gave this season a 5 star even though it wasn't my most favorite.  They always have a good cliff hanger at the end and this one was no exception.  Just finished watching season 10 the other day getting ready for Season 11.<br /><br />Hated to hear Ziva was leaving but I'm sure they will come up with a good replacement.  I thought Ziva was an excellent replacement for Kate.  I don't watch a lot of TV but this show I do try and catch and if I miss an episode I go to CBS the next evening and watch it.<br /><br />They did announce they wouldn't leave the audience hanging and let them know if there is a relationship between Tony and Ziva or if they go their separate way.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This does give you live TV.  However----It is nothing that I would really want to watch.  It is public and foreign television and not network TV like I expected.  Not worth the effort to download as far as I'm concerned.  Amazon missed the boat on this one.

B007ZXK08C|3.0|It was one of those books that you could put down - not binding at all. And I did not like the ending
0399162097|5.0|I thought this was such a strange read, finding it hard to describe to anyone.  But I have to say, it was a page turner that begged for a resolute ending and I felt driven to find it.
B00E6F155E|5.0|I am not reviewing the product because I already own so many Live Peter Gabriel albums, so please forgive me if I sound ungrateful.  Of course I celebrate the Peter of yesteryear, the experimental Peter of the 1980s, the emotionally magnificent Peter of the 1990s, the dark edgy Peter of 2000, but what I need now, and I mean I NEED this like another Chapter to the Book of Life, is a new Peter Gabriel that speaks to this decade, to this time, to this point of his life.  Yes, yes, I know his music is about the heart and therefore transcends time - but we're also talking about one of the most significant songwriters of his generation (or EVER in my book) and though every artist gets older, I would love for him to do as Yeats says and \\"rage against the dying of the light.\\"  His new masterpiece could be recorded in a dingy basement with only a baby grande, it could be captured in a peeling broken down barn with only an accoustic guitar, bass and a Polish steel drum player (don't laugh...peter could find one)and locusts ringing in the summer air.<br /><br />My point is, it doesn't have to be PERFECT, nothing is perfect, if fact, art is only enhanced by raw imperfections, and most importantly, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO \\"LIVE UP TO\\" THIS NOSTALGIA WORSHIPPING GREATEST HITS CULTURE.  It only needs to be an expression of Peter Gabriel whatever that is, broken free from the pressures of yesteryear's stadium shows.  I wish he would let us into his Secret World.  It's not that I don't appreciate the re-releases of older classics, but Peter is good enough not to need to do SO much of it.<br /><br />I was at the Hollywood Bowl show last October where he performed SO in its entirety (one of my favorite albums of all time) and yes it was great to see John Cusak watching from the wings with tears in his eyes, but the HIGHLIGHT of that show was when Peter busted out an untitled song that was so new that he didn't even have lyrics for it.  I'm listening to this gorgeous ballad and I'm thinking, \\"I NEED THIS SONG, MY LIFE NEEDS THIS - BUT WHERE ARE THE WORDS???\\"  Of course I was appreciative of this peek into his creative process, but all he needed to do was write something down...ANYTHING and we, the audience would have followed his powerful instincts like puppies after the shaman's kibble.  I feel that episode sadly embodied the reason why I haven't seen an album of new Peter Gabriel songs in over 10 years, he's too careful with his jewels.  And as I said, he doesn't need to be.  The music business has changed so much and I have heard some truly earth-shattering songs from the most minimal of productions (Eluvium, Grouper, Bon Ivar)  Of course, it's Peter's work and he can do whatever he darn well pleases, but it's only my two cents that his greatness is not something that only existed in 1987, and with this current output many youngins might think that he's a dated artist cashing in on his former accomplishments.  I personally refuse to believe this.  Peter's greatest work is yet to come.  I only wish he would release it in the same spiritual, musical, emotional, unpretentious outpour that he is known and LOVED for.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|I had not heard of Breaking Bad until last week when my neighbor told me about it. I watched some of the current shows on TV and am hooked. I wanted to get the whole story so bought Season 1 and am now plowing through Season 2. Compelling, very well written and acted.... I just love it!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I down loaded this for my kids and few minutes into it I'm hooked I keep saying let me just get this land and oh let me complete this family. Totally fun and cute game.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I believe that almost everyone needs to read this book! This book may be hard to read because of the graphic details of what was done sexually to this 11 year old girl, but think of how hard it was for this girl to write this book and relive all of those horrible memories!she wrote this book because she did not want to give her kidnapper 1 additional ounce of control over her by continuing to keep his secret as she had done for 18 years of her life. She also wanted everyone to know what a horrible man he was. She also wrote this book to encourage everyone to pay a little more attention to what their neighbors might be doing. Had someone done that for her, including her kidnapper's parole officer who had been to that house on several occasions, she might have been rescued in months or even years instead of 18 years. Reading this book, I feel like I owe it to this girl to read her story. It took courage to write this, and reveal all of these graphic details. That's why I feel like in a way we owe it to her to read this story, because in doing so, we may all be more vigilant in the future and possibly save someone else from going through what she did.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a former male boss at a time when I really needed it.  If you had asked me before reading this if I was a (f-word) feminist, I would have said no.  Boy has that changed over the course of just 1 week.<br /><br />The book reads very easily and is simply chock full of wisdom and anecdotes and suggestions as to how we can all do our part to affect change and strive toward equality amongst men and women.<br /><br />I recommend any male or female in corporate America read this book, as well as women and men who do the hard work of raising kids and staying home with them.<br /><br />I can't remember when I last felt so passionate about a book and message.  Thank you, Sheryl Sandberg.  Thank you!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|With Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson, I expected a lot more than this movie delivers.  The story moves to quickly to be believable.  Very disappointing
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|A great value for money, will move ur simple HD enabled devise to a smart TV, (actually all what you need from a smart TV is YouTube ) and this device do it in a marvelous way<br /><br />Pros:<br />1- great simple and effective package that give u all what you need to start streaming.<br />2- a nice IOS application to help u setting the device up in 2 minutes (really I did it )<br />3-it does not drain your battery of the iPad as it only starts the video form the iPad but it use the wireless network to stream not your device (as some smart tv does)<br />4- you can plan a tv queue that will fill your day with highly selected by you watching materials<br /><br />Cons:<br />1- it has to be connected to electricity or USB cable (not a big problem but the video gives u the idea that u will not need that )<br />2- only YouTube from iPad (we don't have Netflix here.<br /><br />The missing star is only to push them to make an update to allow more application to pair
B004TI5N38|5.0|It's aNother great book by Baldacci.  A fantastic story, great writing, great characters.  Can't wait to read his next book!
B00DQAM5LI|2.0|I became their fan recently, so I was anciously waiting for this one. But I was very disapointed with the results. Forget the energy from \\"Critical Aclaim\\" and the melodies from \\"Afterlife\\". This sounds A LOT like Metallica's black álbum (which I love), only they don't have the Metallica brand on them. The first song starts a lot like Megadeth's \\"Trust\\" and they have a song that will remind you of the main riff from Metallica's \\"Sad But True\\". And that's it.<br /><br />Slower, heavy songs, no good melodies... Very disapointing to me.

B000NA2776|5.0|a little late hearing about this. I just started listening to Pandora and thay happened to play a few songs so I bought it. Very happy with the music. You can't be in a bad mood while listening. Just a lot of fun music especially 'Grace Kelly&#34;

B009AJDDQU|5.0|Lets see if Ridley , extends the story to ware it leaves off.  Alien was probably the best at showing what would seem in this time period of what we know of realistic<br />looking space flight.<br />Add 100 years or so and you could maybe see a normal event of a cargo ship in flight threw space with blue collar type crewman, headed from point a to b;  add a unknown beacon that stops them and you got yourself a plot. Well you know the rest,, ''That is'' Ridley. As far as the sequels, he had nothing to do with them. And give Hollywood a chance for more $, you get [Predators versus Aliens] I digress, There are very few scary movies made that scare me, well maybe a few, but suspense trumps all.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief it's an amazing and beautifully written book. I've never read something like it. Every character was important to the story and had their own background which gave them so much more depth. I can only define the story as a beautiful tragedy. It made me cry, laugh, smile, and it also gave a sort of disappointing feeling toward humans, like &#34;How could something like this happen? Why did we allow it?&#34; This book is the kind that gives you an important lesson, a book from which you learn, a book that changes you with the power of words. And in my opinion those are always the best...
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am finding this game addictive.  I am quite sure I will enjoy for a long time . Will be checking out other Quell games.
0670014893|5.0|Nobody but le Carré can take a clutch of conversations and a passel of anguished thoughts and stitch them into a tense nail-biter. Plot? Who needs it? There's a bit of plot, but that's not what the book's about. Other writers need plot to drive the action. Le Carré has his tense conversations and agonised decisions. One of the very few who writes mystery/spy/thrillers for grown-ups.<br /><br />This is a classic in the le Carré tradition and one of the better recent ones.<br /><br />Five stars.

B00B1D7ANK|5.0|This dragon by Schleich is a must have for any dragon lover in your house.  The manufacture suggested age is 3 years-15 years.  I would change that to 5 years to 105 years, if the person appreciates dragons.<br /><br />This toys includes both the dragon and his rider.  The  4 inch tall rider is not pose-able, but can stand on his own. His sword and shield are permanently attached. He has a magnet in his behind, which helps him stay on the dragon when he is riding.<br /><br />The dragon, which measures about 11 inches in length, is adorned with amazing body armor and a saddle. He has wings that pivot, but they also pop out. However, the wings pop very easily back in place and they are large enough that they would be hard to misplace.<br /><br />This is a very well-crafted figure that is fully hand painted. It is one of those toys that could be cherished and played with and then passed down to the next generation.
B00B8XC2O0|5.0|Well, its even better since I got two somehow. From the vendor and the subvendor too. Or was it 2 for 1.<br />Best thought is that I really really like it.

Thank you for making this available.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This movie really hits home with me.  I love talky movies, and this is about as talky as it gets.  I really identified with Ethan Hawke's character Jessie, a person who sort of sleep walks through his life meeting obligations and expectations yet starving emotionally.

B00B89LZ4C|1.0|I ordered two of these Mezco Toys Breaking Bad \\"action figures\\" and was incredibly disappointed as soon as I opened the box. I lifted one of the packages out and the cardboard backing was completely separated from the plastic window on the front. The second of the two was partially attached, but it was immediately apparent that these figures were knowingly sent out in this condition as there was scotch tape around the edges meant to keep the plastic from separating from the cardboard. Like other collectors, I had no intention of removing the figures from their packaging, knowing that any future value depends on this condition.<br /><br />Since the package was opened, I took the opportunity to inspect the figure. As others have noted, this is less an action figure than it is a statuette given the limited articulation. That being said, the figure looked great in terms of detail and finish. Brian Cranston should be proud of the likeness.<br /><br />I'm not sure where the breakdown happened and who is responsible for allowing these figures out the door in the condition received. it's a shame because they would otherwise be great collectibles. I've opted to return mine for a full refund until there can be some guarantee of the quality/condition of the product being shipped.<br /><br />Buyer beware.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|It only goes so far and then expects you to be so hooked that you will pay more for the next part of the puzzle.  Bleh.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Honestly just bought this with a knife to boost the price for free shipping but it actually turned out to be the best &#34;pocket/mini&#34; sized knife sharpener I own now. It's simple to use and gets the job done.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|As a former teenage girl, I can say that Mr. Roses truly knows how scared and insecure girls are on the inside all the while trying to pretend to be grownup on the outside.<br /><br />Another elegant and simply written novel by Jams N Roses.<br /><br />\\"The candle had burnt down and the flame had to fight for its life.\\"  Finding Her Feet (Kindle Location 803).
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Here They come to save the day!!! Amazing film Plenty of Action. Little drama. Focus was where it was needed to be.
B003PBB4ME|3.0|The handle and the actual base of the X-grip were not aligned. So that threw off point it straight. Its pretty flimsy in the use of materials. Overall, go buy a Cam trol. Or something thats actually worth your time and money
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Loved it - even more than the 2009 Star Trek movie.  Still a fan of the original movies, but I like these reboots even more.
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|Does it tread any new ground, not necessarily.  Is it still fresh and exciting, absolutely!  Well done JLB and Matt Guillory.
B00AYB1GAS|5.0|The one and a half hours watching Baraka is well worth the time.  Without words, the movie may be interpreted differently by everyone who watches it.  One thing for sure, it makes one think about things differently.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Love this collection as it has all the movies plus bonus DVD. Every time we watch the movies we see/understand another scene...it's that kind of movie...and such a classic.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simplicity, ease of setup and quick installation.  More importantly the HD streaming player for the lowest possible price from Google.
B009AY04A8|5.0|The graphics are absolutely great in this game.  So life like.  It has been a challenging  game.  Sure I will be spending many fun filled hours playing this game.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I haven't read an Archer book for a while and had forgotten how he weaves a good story. There are enough twists an turns to keep the interest flying. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good, many facetted story. I will be reading more of his books.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I can't get an English version no matter what I tried so just deleted it, never got to try it.
0143039482|5.0|By the description I was expecting there to be some possible signs of wear, but when it came in the mail it was flawless. A big plus was the speed of the shipping
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Although I couldn't see myself enjoying this book as much as the first one, I found myself racing through to see how it would end. Fitting Ending that I enjoyed.
0142410705|5.0|This is the first John Green book I ever read and it may not be my favorite but it will always be what drew me to Green as an author.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Tried other bingo on my kindle find this the best of all the ones I have tried. Would recommend to anyone needing a bingo without spending your own money.
014241493X|5.0|One of those books that make you stop and reflect upon your life. Funny and interesting. Makes me want Green to try his hand at a mystery novel.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderful story but what I loved the most were the characters! It's been a long time since I've read a book with such great characters!
0525478817|5.0|I can't wait for the movie. This book will grab a hold of you and not let go. Such wonderful characters and a beautifully honest story
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Story just seemed to drag on and on and on without really going anywhere...at one point you think it is going to and then poof the climax is over...Frustrating part is I have to read the 3rd book because I have to know how it will all end!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ask<br /><br />Great job<br />Free and open to the airdo and I have been in the airdo and I think that this is the great game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I felt that I was on the journey with Harold....rooting for him, all the way.<br />A very enjoyable read. a lot of life lessons in this story.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Tries to explain the basis behind what we saw in the Classic Wizard of Oz and succeeds fairly well. Mila Kunis does a great job but James Franco seemed a little wooden. Incorporated more of the &#34;lands&#34; in the books than the original did. Just glad they didn't try to turn it into a musical.
0689878451|5.0|I love how the story very subtly introduces kids to all kinds of families that come in different sizes and shapes.
B005UKK4Y2|4.0|Really enjoyed the premise and the performances. Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Spacey were especially good. I always like Jason Bateman in pretty much anything
B001P06GX4|5.0|Can't play it enough. Easy to teach someone new in just a few minutes and great for kids all the way up to grandparents.  I play this with my 7 yr old during the day and drag it out at night with my husband and do not feel like I'm playing a kid game.  Highly recommend it!<br /><br />If you try to play only two people be sure to follow the directions and use all the colored tiles otherwise the game will seem way to easy.  You need to play all the colors every time (2, 3, or 4 people).
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This show has it all.  The characters are well developed.  The plot is well thought out. The heroes/heroins are likable and believable and you love to hate the villains.  It is not 100% historically correct, but close enough to be entertaining and intellectually stimulating.<br /><br />Stellar cast.  Excellent acting.<br /><br />LOVE. IT.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|This book showed up on a list of good fantasy books and sounded interesting, so I started reading it.  By page 70, there was yet to be a single female character (unless you count the referenced dead horse Nellie).  Then it turned out that these first pages were all just set-up to a first person flashback that was the rest of the novel, which I consider narrative cheating.  The writing was OK on the sentence level, but there was nothing that took my breath away.  I returned it to the library, unfinished.  It was like getting grape juice when you'd ordered pinot noir: harmless, but not what was wanted.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't wait to read the rest of the story!  I am not a big fan of the fantasy series genre. I didn't know that this was the first in a series.  Now I can't wait to read the rest.
B008602KQI|2.0|I have read all of the hunger games books,and found a lot of mistakes in this movie. In my opinion, if your gonna make a movie you have to come down to every detail. This also had no impact whatsoever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son who loves this pocket edition on his tablet, he plays it every time we leave the house.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|Ok. I admit, if I read a book I find so many little things wrong with the movie. I found at least several things wrong with the hunger games movie, but this is just unacceptable. There were more things wrong than right. And for the last time, ANNABETH IS A BLONDE!!!!!!! With grey eyes!!!!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This is an informative book, statements  that might be controversial to some i was already aware of.  I found the causal tone annoying though.
B008M36EEI|2.0|Just not into this movie, never even finished it...total waste of time...even my wife was not interested in watching the rest of the movie
0307477479|4.0|This character driven book is hard to put down. It will follow you into your dreams.<br />The writing is bright, sharp-edged, and original. A real &#34;make it new&#34; piece.<br />You'll want to keep it by your desk to refer back.<br />My only beef - at times it seems to drag, but only a little bit.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love the clock, a little confusing on how to set but once you are used to it  it's fine...great waking up to my own music
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Really?  What is there to say about Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy??  I can watch this over and over again
B000I186FW|4.0|Pretty good movie. Well worth the cost. It tells the story of todays politics and corruption. I'll watch it again.
034580404X|5.0|Loving the complete collection.  You must get it.  This is a must have collection for all WOMEN. Enjoy reading every book.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I would like to have the older version back<br />,  I was able to view more than the 7 day forecast
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I was expecting more about Lincoln's life but was thrilled with this movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job! I would definitely recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This replaced my media computer for netflix.  Much better to use an interactive touchscreen as a netflix remote.  This WILL be the future.  Mark my words.  Soon it will just be built right into TV's.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|I hated how when you were on level ten the opponent would take a soooo long to decide what move to do but the rest was great.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Great movie to show kids these days because this is one movie that they have not seen - it never shows up on TV!!!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Love the beat and their talent. They have gotten even better then the first time that I ever herd of them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like the game but really needs more levels and should be more complicated.  my 11year old beat the game in less than 60 minutes. Great game for using problem solving skills...like being in one of those movies where you have to figure out how to get out before you die, but without dying. maybe each level should be timed to add more tension. overall good fun but needs more levels, I beat the game rather quickly..
B00C5ZORES|4.0|The music has a great beat and I can listen to it with my kids. I like their style and voices.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoy playing tis lovely game . Its very creative and mindful to me . I wish to spend many time playing this as possible. Thanks again , I love it &lt;3
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game it is awesome it is fun and cool it is easy I love games like this
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I haven't gotten to the extra  yet so I will have to let you know on those.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|A Nobel Laureate and a joker.  One of the best parts is how he cracked the safes at Lon Alomos and Oakridge containing all the secrets of The Bomb.
B007SGM084|3.0|Could Not read it completely  I wouldn't like my children catching my kindle until I figure out  how to  remove a book from the kindle.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|A simple and easy to use app. Has a nice display and not a bunch of useless features. Just what I want
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved subway surfers it had amazing graphics awesome powerups and all my family loves it!! I could connect to Facebook and get a reward!I suggest subway surfers too all customers you and your kids will love it! Don't listen to the bad reviews for one minute. Buy subway surfers i would even pay for it but I dont have to! Have a good night.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|One would enjoy this film if they are over 50 or work with or simply have a love for the more mature in our society.  I found it both touching and very sad as the lives of famous singers and musicians were thrown together in very intimate ways as they aged and loss their capabilities.  Dustin Hoffman did a wonderful job.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is app is awesome! No problems. Worth downloading. :) plus it's freee. I couldn't ask for anything better! I use it for all my pictures!
B007IK44CK|5.0|Tom Cruise does it again! Paula Patton was awesome. Highly recommend! Great addition to the series and they step it up again!
0061950726|5.0|Two women's lives, separated by generations and social status, become intertwined as a result of common circumstances resulting in a wonderful friendship.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|I absolutely love Adam and his music.  I met him last year and saw him in concert the same day....he is really AWESOME!!  Would love to see him play with Queen.
0375869026|5.0|Everyone should be required to read this book!  As a society, we should be more sensitive to the feelings of others.
B0056E3S4U|5.0|I love David Cook and this album is so good.  He has a great voice and many of the songs are very relatable.  I saw him perform last year and he is so real and down to earth.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the novel's depth. It went into a lot of intricate detail about each character, and the author let's you know what's going on thoroughly, front to back. No plot holes, and I didn't feel myself lost or confused at any point in the book. I love it when a book is very detailed, and answers every question the reader might have.<br />  Something I didn't like about the novel was that the ending (which I will not say) was very predictable. I knew what would happen at the conclusion of the novel and it wasn't, I shouldn't say disappointing, but I can say 'expected'. It isn't a shocker, or jaw-dropping book, at least it wasn't for me, or not nearly as jaw-dropping as I expected. Anyway, I would recommend it to a friend, in hopes that they would be more surprised than I was.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Great music. Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson...Hilarious. Some gross parts reminiscent of Bridesmaids, but hey...nothing wrong (I guess) with a little potty humor. Just be careful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We can't wait for season 4! Maggie Smith is the best!!! Many of our family members are hooked on this show.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|addictive and fun :) i immediately downloaded this game when i read all the reviews. now i play the game everyday and i recommend this to all gamers.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun, fast and keeps you coming back. Good variety of bingo and slots.  Very addictive. Excellent game for the whole family.
B008M4MB8K|4.0|This is a great film but amazon has this set listed wrong. This is only a 3 disc bluray set not 5 disc. There is also no Dvd in this at all they are all bluray's.  You have Disc 1 Final cut , Disc 2 theaterical version, International theactrical Verson and the Directors cut. Disc 3 is the workprint and Extras. So just be aware that this is what you are getting for the price. The book is nice and the picture quality of the bluray's are excellent. Final Cut Version is the best. If you want to bypass all of the extra stuff just get the Final Cut. If you are a collector and just want the other versions this is the way to go. The book is hard cover and is of high quality and the photos are very colorful.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|If you are a cat person... you will love this book. But, more importantly, if you believe in second chances.. whether for a person, for a cat or both..  you will love this book. Never think that the love of a pet cannot transform the broken live of a human.  I absolutely adored this book... well done, Bob and James!
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The three &#34;Complete Recordings&#34; collections are a must-have for Howard Shore and &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; soundtrack aficionados.  I currently have this boxed set along with the &#34;Fellowship of the Ring&#34; boxed set and eagerly await the re-release of &#34;The Two Towers&#34; set at an affordable price.  The current aftermarket prices are absurdly expensive.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|A little glitz, a little drama, a little glimpse into the dark side of game/politics of law and power, A LOT ENTERTAINING. I like the way aspects of the story continue on from episode to episode but something usually concludes each episode so your not angry that you have to wait until the next episode. Will purchase season 3!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed this very much and liked the story but also the quirkiness of the characters and poignant moments this tale has.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|The album includes all the favorite classics. It's a much better deal than buying lots of songs individually. Thumbs up!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I fell in love with the characters.  I couldn't put the book down.  The writer has you so intrigued by each character, you can feel exactly what is happening.
0399159347|5.0|This is easily the best book I have read this year. I suggested it for a book club and am glad I did, because there is so much to talk about. This book can inspire lively debates and discussions, since there are three very unique and engaging stories here, each facing its own set of moral conflicts and questions of ethics. It's a story of three women, each going through a powerful struggle in their lives, and the intricate way their lives overlap. Like other reviewers, I want to be careful with how much I give away so I'll stop there.<br /><br />From the first page you are pulled in because you know there is something big going on. Moriarty is a master at creating cliff-hangers... at the exact moment you don't want a chapter to end, it does, and you are forced to dive into a different character's story. It never annoys you though, because you become so emotionally vested in each character that you can't wait to dive back in.<br /><br />I love the author's ability to foreshadow - you just know that in the beginning, with \\"Biggest Loser\\" parallels and Berlin Wall parallels, that these characters' lives will converge in a big and monumental way, you just don't know how.<br /><br />Parts of the book (I felt) were a little predictable, but overall I couldn't put it down. 6 hours of sleep in 2 nights is a testament to how fantastic and engaging this book was! And the prologue was absolutely the perfect way to end this thought-provoking novel. It is hard to put into words, but it truly causes you to look at life differently, because all of the things you THINK you know, you don't.
B0090SI460|5.0|This movie was great in blu ray did not think it could much better. the colors and textures just pop out at you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun great cool but I wish you didn't gave to buy grub points and it was easier to buy costumes overall very fun :)
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Really good show! The characters give it good entertainment.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys crime dramas
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie stayed true to the comics!  Karl Urban did an excellent job and the slo-mo scenes were amazing. One of the best comic book movies in a while!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|great songs I bought the whole album, never heard of this band before their  song &#34;If I die young&#34; and &#34;Done&#34;
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander is the consummate spokesman for NDE (as he calls them.)  Probably his scientific background kept my attention.  Good read.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I do not read end of the world books! Had I read the plot and found out I was about to buy such a book! Then I would have reconsidered.<br /><br />Lesson leaned I am going to read the rest! And then I'm going to be longing for more!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Best adding game ever it is so much fun to play  I would play it all day long if I could
1594746036|5.0|I bought this book for vacation after someone else said it was good. I don't usually read fiction but I couldn't wait to read it. I really enjoyed it and ordered the second book on reserve.
0618871713|3.0|Many incoming college freshmen have been assigned to read FUN HOME: A FAMILY TRAGICOMIC during the summer between high school graduation and college.  Reading a letter written by a Southern woman whose child had to read this work, I decided I wanted to know exactly what it concerns to outrage a mother whose child was about to enter college.  She even questioned the $10,000 the college plans to pay to have Bechdel speak to the freshmen class about her biography.  The rationale behind the assignment centers around informing the reader about the different types of people he may encounter in college and in the world.  Bechdel's artwork is shocking and graphic, especially for a reader who is not expecting to be reading about and seeing images of a homosexual father and his lesbian daughter.  Having taught high school English for many years, I would NOT assign this book to anyone,
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|Schleich makes very detailed and impressive figures; this Dragon Rider is no exception.<br />Their figures are both toys and collectables depending on the buyer.<br />With the wings extended this is over 15 inches wide, about nine inches long and about six inches high.<br />The dragon is armored with an ax attached to its' spiked tail.<br />The wings can be positioned from full flight to drawn back for movement on the ground.<br />The wings do have a tendency to pop out of their ball & socket joint but are easy to put back.<br />The rider is attached to the dragon by a magnet meaning their are few problems when they are in flight.<br />The detail is excellent.<br />The rider has painted eyes and ears under his helmet.<br />Painted straps attach the armor and saddle to the dragon.<br />The knight has gold accents on his shield and armor.<br />My Grandson fell in love when he saw it and Always plays with it.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|Grace runs into a burning school to save her teenage daughter. Now they're both in comas which allow them to communicate with each other and transport themselves any where. Turns out the fire was arson. Part mystery, part fantasy part a love story between Grace and her husband and Grace and her children, AFTERWARDS defies genre.<br />I like Rosamund Lupton's fluid writing style which doesn't bog down the story with useless detail. AFTERWARDS is a fast paced read, told in first and second person as Grace narrates most of the story to her husband, frequently using \\"you\\" in her narration.<br />I didn't enjoy the supernatural aspect of the story. If Grace was having thoughts in a coma, I'd have been more satisfying but her ability to be everywhere, observing seemed to be an artificial device to allow Grace a certain omnipotence to tell the story.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Loved this book. These guys sound so interesting. Totally to the point with no fluff. I got lots of ideas and found it an easy read.<br />Gives you many little ah-ha moments.
B006T3RM08|5.0|Very good only dock in could find that you don't have to take devices out to turn on very convenient and easy access also easy to remove devices kudos
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Harry Hole is an interesting character who has enough personal flaws that we can identify his personal struggles as he works at solving crimes.  This novel draws on Norwegian WWII history that I was unfamiliar with and reflected how history is always intruding into the present.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Helps pass the time away.<br /><br />This game is very addictive.<br />The best thing of all is th a that it is free to load on the kindle.
1444777556|5.0|A wonderful follow up to the first book. It should not take only a cat fancier to appreciate the connective feeling between man and animal.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A smart and sassy drama with humor, heart and guts. Great writing that is smartly presented. Law at it's most interesting!
1444737112|5.0|I lived in London - Finsbury Park, and could identify the locations mentioned during James's travels with Bob. I also had a large ginger cat named Monty (named after Field Marshall Montgomery). That cat was not a cat, but a human in a fur coat with a tail. My cat never learned to use the toilet, as a toilet, but used it as a drinking bowl. The relationship between Bob and James was beautiful and simply described. I loved the book. It was the first in a long time that I found difficult to put down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great challenge for your mind and I love to see how my 5 year old challenges himself in putting the puzzles together doing some detective work. Love it!
0684857219|5.0|I was reading this book hardcore for a good two weeks. I haven't finished it yet, but there are some great concepts and off encouragment that you can directly apply today. I took on the arnold work out and my gains were BIG. My bench was stuck at 265 lbs and I was able to work it up to 315! It's a must have.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|One of the games I like to play when bored somewhere! I never get enough! My kids love it too!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Follett is a great story teller and the characters are &#34;real&#34; by the time you have lived with them through his stories. He has researched the era well.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good feature for kindle fire! Mine is not the HD kind and this works perfect! Love it I highly recommend this
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|This is a lovely book..about hope and love..Bob is a great cat..Amazing in how he watched out for his nee best friend..would love to meet them
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kiddos love this game and spend  a great time in the car playing it. I caught myself very entertained when showing my two year old to play it!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This is a must have for your gopro device. Great for reviewing photos and recordings in the field. Must have.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|My kids made me watch this movie with them and I loved it! I felt like a kiddo again! :-)
B00BPOYM7M|1.0|very poor copy of this great concert. I have it on cd but wanted to hear it on my Kindle. It sounds like a cell phone copy, songs are played twice, and the continuity of the presentation is a disaster.
B00640UICA|4.0|So this game starts out fairly easy. All you need to do is get every hand held. Then it quickly progresses to more and more difficult levels. There are some that have me turning off my device in disgust because I can't figure it out.<br />This game is challenging. I enjoy a good challenge.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Couldn't figure out how to play this game. There aren't any directions that I could find with the game. I deleted it.
B00COHIFQS|1.0|Horrible plot, graphics, doesn't even make you jump! I turned it on 45 minutes into the movie because of how pathetic it was. Don't waste your money.
0307891372|4.0|The wear was I expected however large map is missing which is very useful and missed. Should be disclosed at purchase.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|This game has been great for my 4 year old. He can do all the games and the characters are cute. We got this as the &quot;free app of the day&quot;, but we would have paid money for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must read book. I will refer to a friend for sure. The characters comes alive making  this book very entertaining.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|As with the rest of this series, an excellent book.  The first of his series, the Sharpe books got me involved in reading more.<br />Jane
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|OOOOkay! The review requires more words. It is just an ok movie to waste some time on. Sci-fi is unrealistic after all ;).
B001U3ZMHW|5.0|My son loved this lego set we ordered for his birthday. It arrived in the date range specified when I ordered and was complete and intact.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Grandson ordered this to play on Kindle.  He plays it but we have not had it long enough to see if he enjoys it.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|From the first scenes, this book reminded me of the Chronicles of Narnia, a favorite of my childhood.  But as it continues, the main character, Peter, is drawn into a world that is very Tim Burton-esque.  The twisting of familiar themes from many of our favorite stories is not obvious but when I went back and gave the book a second read, I could pick them out and that delighted me.<br /><br />Peter is the kind of hero we can all relate to, no matter how old we are.  He is finding his own brand of courage and learning what it means to be strong.  He is finding out things about himself he never knew before.  It is on one hand, a sort of coming of age story and on the other, an imaginative adventure.<br /><br />But whatever you take away from this story, I guarantee, you will be entertained.  The world draws you in and invites you to play while the characters offer themselves up as the most unusual and sometimes frightening of playmates.<br /><br />**I received a free copy in exchange for a fair & honest review**
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This was for my grandson.  He plays it all the time.  He is only 5 years old but loves anything with cars and trucks.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Maybe it is not a completely accurate retelling of the occurrence but I found the movie entertaining. Good cast and good pace.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|This movie made me like James Bond even more. Daniel Craig is awesome. Lots of action! Buy this movie! It's cool!
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|Good story and good classical animation along with solid action. I don't know if it's Frank Miller's brilliance or the film maker's but I really enjoyed this.
B002KKCVS2|5.0|Fit great. Very comfortable. They replaced a size 10 Merrill which were just a little to big. These fit much better
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This was an okay movie and had some laughs but not really highly recommended but if you've got nothing else to watch it could be worse.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|To many of the questions did not have a clear answer. And even when it was clear I did not see why this is interesting. Obviously not meant for someone like me
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|If you are a professional person this is the social network for you. I have been able to re-connect with alums and professionals in industries that I am seeking to gain employment. A+.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I usually don't watch much TV or shows and found this and got into it immedaitly. Only problem is once I bought it<br />my daughter informed me it is free on my netflix account. OOOps.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|If not for the beauty of Mila Kunis, this movie would have been totally overlooked by me. However, Kunis' character is just too thin in an already thin prequel to probably when of the all time great classics.
B002GMSMHS|3.0|Despite worry it was perfect. included a good luck ribben  Don nothing missing.. This red ribbon came in a tiny envelope.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, I am just so pleasantly surprised that Hollywood didn't try to re-write history and make the Democrats the party that was trying to abolish slavery as opposed to their real stance to maintain it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|The series is fantastic but was frustrated by the instant player... I might consider buying from through itunes next time.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Sam is really slipping or just dialing it in. He seems to not have grown since his Evil Dead II movie. It seems that he just can't put together anything interesting, since &#34;Drag Me to Hell.&#34;
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|A cult classic.  Peter Sellers is great.  Every time you see it, if you pay attention, you will pick up on many suttle things in names, dialog, etc, which make the movie even funnier.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It was an interesting retelling of Romeo and Juliet but was just too weak all around. The humor was just lacking.
140006922X|4.0|I checked nearly all of the quotes used and they make sense with the author's points.  The book brings out another perspective on Jesus.  Very interesting and logical whether you agree with the author or not.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Good story and good classical animation along with solid action. I don't know if it's Frank Miller's brilliance or the film maker's but I really enjoyed this.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|GOODNESS, I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS GAME... AND IT HAS TOTALLY SURPASSED MY HOPES.  I WISH IT WAS MORE LIKE THE OLD PC. VERSION<br />.  I LOVED RUNNING AROUND THE MAP TO CASTLES, BUT HAPPY BEGGARS CANNOT BE TOO CHHOSEY.  GREAT BUY AND GREAT FUN.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Not quite what I wanted which was a portal to YouTube but with the ongoing software wars it is all I could get with my Kindle.
B005D4YHP2|5.0|I normally wear a size 10 (US). I had read that the Keens were cut a bit on the small side. Keen's 10 was definitely too small when I tried in the store and I so I tried the 10.5 in the store. The 10.5 was comfortably snug all around except I had some lingering doubts (though not major ones) about the toe.  I asked to try an 11 in the store but they did not have an 11.  I found that Amazon had an 11 and I took a chance that it would fit better than the 10.5.  Some doubts were raised when I tried on a pair of Keen 11's that a friend had and they felt too big (albeit they were an old pair and not the same model).  I even attempted to cancel the order because of it but it was too late.  In the end I kept the 11s: definitely felt more comfortable at the toe and not as snug everywhere else (I actually had a preference for the snugness of the 10.5s - the logic being that the leather would stretch with usage).<br />Bottom line: would recommend ordering at least 1/2 a size larger than normal. A full size larger worked for me but I've seen other reviewers who recommended going 1/2 a size bigger.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoy this show and all the creative talent involved. I really think that they have recaptured the classic Zombie genre that has been so elusive as of late for other film makers.
B00DM0YE9S|4.0|The acting pulls off the story.  To me, a USN Submariner from the 60s (when the event-basis of the movie's story actually took place), there was ample room to ignore the fact that the pier-tied Soviet Foxtrot museum boat at San Diego was the boat used for the background.  The action was good and the story line carried the day, making it easier to overlook that it was a fictionalize version of events from 1968.  Ed Harris and company did an outstanding job.  By the way, the sub used for the filming is a Foxtrot Class (Nato term) while the Soviet sub involved in the actual events was a Golf Class (also Nato name).  I appreciated the way the director handled the fact that the boat sank and the crew perished, which I knew going in.  It was a moving sequence for a retired submariner.  The Soviets were brother submariners, in spite of the fact that we were cold war enemies.  There is much more to this compelling story, if one cares to do the research (ref. Glomar Explorer etc).
B004P1JDJO|5.0|One big problem with our educational system is that we have spent the past couple of decades dangling incentives in front of our students thinking that it will motivate them to learn.  Turns out that humans are born hard-wired to be curious and inquisitive.  Go figure.  Daniel Pink reminds us of that fact and much more in this book that everyone in education should be required to read.
B001O771B4|4.0|Like many here I am a multi-decade fan of Jeff Beck's body of work. I've seen him a few times over the last 4+ decades. In fact, we lucked into &#34;having breakfast with him&#34; (more or less...we were alone with him in the same hotel restaurant in Tulsa having a late breakfast the day of the show, but we chose not to bother him and his long-time manager. Wish I had thought to buy his breakfast tho'!) But I digress...<br /><br />I'm always looking for opportunities to add to my Jeff Beck music collection. &#34;Guitar Shop&#34; was one of the few works I hadn't yet acquired. When I located the Blu-Spec version, I decided to give it a try. I had never seen this particular format before. Note that it is NOT &#34;Bluray&#34; and it WILL play on standard CD players. It's not cheap, but given the success I've had with some discs I've accumulated in other formats or re-issues, including MoFi gold CDs made from original masters, Sony 20-bit SBM discs, SACDs, DVD-As, etc, I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />I can't compare the sound quality of this disc and format to the standard issue, because I don't own the standard disc and haven't heard it. Having said that, I think this investment was worth it. I am fortunate enough to have assembled a very nice playback system over the years, and I use it regularly. So quality of playback is important to me.<br /><br />The sound on this Blu-Spec disc is clean and transparent. Dynamics with drum whacks and guitar plucks and transients are very very good...and goodness knows there are a lot of those! However, the disc is mastered somewhat on the &#34;loud&#34; side, so you may find you will be using a lower volume setting than usual.<br /><br />There is an uncommonly good decay and air as notes fade in intensity, so much so that there is a great sense of depth, providing an almost &#34;in the music hall&#34; feeling of ambience that you don't often get with studio &#34;rock&#34; recordings. Jeff's guitar is all over the room, withtactical dubs that often have you guessing where he's going to attack from next. Images are solid, with great center fill when appropriate. The image is often wider than the separation of the speakers and front to back depth is good.<br /><br />Good examples of this sense of air and ambience are &#34;Behind The Veil&#34; and &#34;Where Were You,&#34; although the more raucous &#34;Stand on It&#34; displays the same sense of space as well.<br /><br />Given the transparency, Jeff's guitar work is a real treat here. You really get a great presentation of his wide variety of tonal colors, textures, and plucking, picking and strumming methods. The first cut &#34;Guitar Shop,&#34; in fact, is a guitar sounds metaphor for hot rodding a car, demonstrating the results of &#34;upgrades&#34; to a standard issue guitar as though the player was hot rodding the guitar, through build and technique. Intriguing, and the transparency of this disc results in all the various techniques of Jeff's playing being on clear display. Impressive.<br /><br />In fact, of course, much of the disc is a metaphor combining references to Jeff's love of hot rod guitar playing and hot rod automobilia.<br /><br />Generally the recording is quite smooth, particularly considering the fantastic clarity. The only real anamoly I noted upon first listen was occasionally somewhat gritty-sounding cymbal work, particularly the hi-hat and/or crash cymbal I think, with a bit less sheen and smoothness than you would expect given the general sound of the disc. My particular sound system can be quite revealing of problems of this nature, but given the overall smoothness of the sound of this disc, again especially given it's transparency, I found it a little out of character. This is really nit-picking.<br /><br />All in all a great addition to the JB collection, and I'm glad I bought it in this format. So much so, in fact, I'll look for more of these Sony Music Japan International, Blu-Spec pressings.<br /><br />I would rate this Blu-Spec effort 5 stars, if not for the high price.<br /><br />Cheers.
B00CWV9FQA|3.0|Great, funny! Thought some of the language was a little inappropriate for kids though. I think I enjoyed it more than my son did. Overall a fun film.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I think that I liked season2 because of the chemistry between Will and Alicia. I was surprised and wanted to see more chemistry. Kalinda really played her role well in season 2 as beeing very mysterious but troubled. I like that she always tries to help the &#34;good guys&#34; in the end. I have a love/hate relationship with Cary. I think he is a good guy gone bad that just needs to find his way back to Lockhart / Gardner.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|I enjoyed watching this relaxing and funny movie.  Movies like Emma are entertaining and enjoyable because they are clean and wholesome.  Thanks for putting it on Amazon.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Unfortunately, after the clone wars series was canceled, it took me a while to calm down as i felt betrayed by the acquisition of lucasfilm by disney. After that shock and disappointment wore off i could reflect on the series as a whole. This season was by far the darkest and most akin to the way the galaxy is by the time we get to revenge of the sith. There is corruption and deception everywhere and in season 5 we FINALLY get to see darth sidious, in all his sith glory. Many supporting characters meet their end in season 5, and those who do go out do so in not quite the way you would think. There are surprises and disappointments, like the droid arc that was painful to watch it was so boring. Some cool highlights in the final season of the clone wars were, the youngling jedi arc, the darth maul arc, and the finale ahsoka arc which was probably the most gut wrenching i've seen. That was a very somber note to leave on but i am very excited that we are still getting bonus episodes of what would have been season 6. The previews for which look amazing as the clone wars has never looked more movie-like. Over the 5 seasons that this show was broadcast, i fell in love with heroes and villains. Many new characters introduced in the show such as cad bane, hondo anaka, savage opress, and of course some of the main clones just added to the amazing expansion of the universe we all love. By the end after all episodes are finally revealed, i hope we'll know more about order 66, sifo dyas, and about the many mysteries of yoda. This show was monumental as i think it broadened the possibilities of star wars, not only visually but also in the storytelling as well. It was sad to see the season end and the clone wars chapter close, but i can always look back on this show as an awesome part of the star wars saga and say it made me an even more hardcore fan than i was previously. This is a show that i can enjoy as well as introduce to my children. Its fun and exciting for everyone of allages, and that's what star wars has always been perfect at.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is a timely and useful replacement of my USB Cable.  The original cable was worn out from constant use.  Thanks for the prompt shipping of the product.
0060775858|5.0|I like this book because it is a sweet book to read to young children at night.  I love giving it as gifts to new families.  The books arrived promptly and were exactly as described.  They were new and were in excellent condition.  I would purchase from this company again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I thought that this was a very informative book about the historical references to Jesus. I am Christian and I am not offended at all by the fact that it was written by a Muslim. I thought that he did a remarkable job researching the history of the time period and any references to the existence of a person named Jesus. I am not speaking from a viewpoint of faith. However I did find references to the Jewish faith as a &#34;cult&#34; a little disturbing. Overall a good read for the curious about the time in which Jesus lived.
1401203078|5.0|My husband loves it!! One of the perfect gifts I picked out for him. But do I really need to write that much?
B009AMANBA|5.0|One of the best movies directed by Steven Spielberg. Abby came to be alive. Wonderful this historic episode of the American history
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Loved the movie, not the book. It was hard for me to get into, beginning was slow, a little repetitive ... Just didn't love it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|By mistake I confure the CD with the blu ray. This is good I returned the CD I boughy by mistake
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I should give this book one star based on the neck ache it gave me!  Nearly six hundred pages without a break.  Couldn't put it down.  I was sucked in immediately, and it just got better and better.  The way he writes is so easy to read.  It just flows.  Everyone is foaming at the mouth for his second book, and he won't disappoint.  The second book is finished and awaiting publication.  He is also halfway through the third book.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't experience this story.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Two things keep this from 5/5. It's easy and I can't multiplayer from kindle fire. Still a fun way to kill some time and refresh my memory on MTG rules.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This series is beautifully done. Costuming and sets are phenomenal. Very well written and acted. Can't wait to watch the next season.
B004NS710C|5.0|&#34;Unstoppable&#34; is one of those movies you can watch many times over - it's hard to believe this was based on a true story
193700788X|4.0|I dont want to give anything away but I feel like Im left with a bunch of loose ends. I guess I just have to wait till October to get the follow up book. I still like it either way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Anything about the Bible is good.  This app was good, still trying to figute out how everything works, but with practice, a must but for all.

B002VWNIDG|5.0|It's The Shining, Jack Nicholson at his best. Well, he was always at his best. But if your over 21 & never watched this classic, what are you waiting for!
B00AEFZBAU|2.0|Sometimes books enhance the movie because of the details and background that they provide. How they made such a wonderful film from this dull book is amazing.
B00AEFXTKO|5.0|I'ce had this movie three times and my kids messed all of them up. But I have it again and its one of my favorite movies!!
B003Z49LYO|5.0|this mini series is an almost flawless adaptation of the novel.  The woman playing Tess does a perfect job - she has such a sweet, soft voice that is gentle yet strong at the same time, and the character of Angel is the and Alex are what I expected them to be - somewhat too good and somewhat too bad so that one wonders why this fabulous woman ever spent a moment with either of them  Certainly today she would have given both of them them boot in no time flat.  But this story did not take place today and the heroine was a tragic figure destined for the worst life imaginable - to be used by her mother and deserted by many.  The movie is beautifully done and the pacing is perfect so long as you know what to expect.  If you are a fan of a quick shoot 'em up then you may not like this movie - but then, I happen to like many things and love this movie so perhaps you might.  This story is for one who can stand a serious cry because if you don't cry by the end of this story you have no heart at all.  If you are familiar with the story I will say this one is much, much better than the Roman P. version done many years ago.  This one is mostly faithful to the novel.  The  only part that I noticed where they weren't faithful SPOILER ALERT STOP READING HERE IF YOU DON&#34;T KNOW THE STORY  is where Alex is murdered.  The way it was done could have been done better, in my opinion because all that red blood just wouldn't have soaked through the plaster without the bathtub water being let to run.  I also think they rushed the ending a wee bit - I would have liked to have seen just a couple more minutes of the &#34;honeymooning&#34; of Angel and Tess as they ran from the police.  The movie makes it look like it was for just a couple of days when it was actually a week or more.  Still, her acceptance of her fate was extremely well done and again, the actress couldn't have been better chosen.
0792839749|5.0|I've looking for this movie for a while now, and now tha I have I am very very satisfied. I watched this movie with my mother as a child now I can share it with my children. Thank you for allowing me to share my family trdition with them!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 10 year old son has watches this at least 7 to 8 times. I have watched it with him a couple of times. It is a very good movie for kids and parents to watch together.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It started with the movie.  I got hooked and read the first book.  Then I read the other two.<br /><br />I found the story to be riveting!  Full of twists and surprises.  Much unexpected violence caught me off guard many times which caused me to suck air in a shocking gasp!<br /><br />This is a great book that held my interest from beginning to end.
B0084FMDO4|5.0|The sandal is well made, has a comfortable insole and three adjustable starps. Well recommended. This is a good buy.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Lets people of all ages use their imagination :) ...Not geared for any specific age group and can keep anyone occupied for a long period of time.

1558908382|5.0|Both actress and actor are wonderful in bring this outlandish spoof to the screen.  Is rest of the cast is also exceptional
1455576387|1.0|I thought I would start reading the King and Maxwell books at the beginning, and so I just finished Split Second.  My very first reaction is that the American reader must be really stupid or really undiscriminating (is that a word?).  The characters in this book are completely 2-dimensional and phony - I couldn't believe in them at all, and many times the \\"heroes\\" of the book do and say things that are either stupid or work against their character.  By the end of the book, I didn't care who lived or died.  The bad guy was just a dork.  And the plot devices (King figures things out but decides not to tell anyone until later, witholding the information for no apparent reason, which shockingly leads to trouble) are strictly first-time author tricks that no editor should allow to get through their filter.  The story is also full of basic errors (several early attempts by the author to confuse the difference between ethanol and methanol, the bad guy drives a \\"Buick Impala\\") that made me wonder if the author was really an adult male or some teenager pretending to be an adult male.  The actions are mostly far-fetched and so silly that they might be at home on an episode of the tv show Psych, but that is giving the book too much credit.<br /><br />It is hard for me to believe this book spawned a series and that people paid to read the other books.  Anyone who thinks this is good fiction would be blown away by vastly better material like anything from Lee Child, John Sandford, or Michael Connelly.<br /><br />I've read worse, but it's been a while...
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|My husband and I will end up watching three or four episodes at a time!!!  We laugh put loud and are totally hooked!  Love it!
0785153942|4.0|It is on the short side as some others have said. Not only does it give a short back story on some characters in the movie, it gives a little more back story into the world. Art is decent, it would be nice if they came out with some more graphic novels, even a limited or ongoing series.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Watching this documetary only confirms the individuality of music must contain the human touch (and ocassional error). Before the perfect world of digital recording, music had a better sound because tape and mixers just sounded better than computers and hard drives.
0525478817|5.0|Fantastic book! I made my sister and boyfriend read it, now we are so excited that they are making a movie
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I know a lot of people complain about the killing off of so many of the main characters but I personally find it amazing.  Everything  and anything could happen.  No one is safe.  It took me a few books to get to this point, but once I did, it just seemed so much better than figuring out early on who would win the throne at the end.  Thank you Lord Martin for keeping me on the edge of my seat the for the entire journey.
0345803493|5.0|As I said wishing there was another book coming.  It was exciting to read and I could not  put it down.
0385537697|5.0|Wishing that there was another book coming.  This keep my interest that with in 5 days I had read this and Fifty Shades Darker
B00CRS88IO|3.0|This bill was fair. Not what I expected. I just happened to come a cross  it while on line. Sub par.
B009AY04A8|3.0|I couldn't find the last difference in a comparison screen, so haven't been able to go any further.  Disappointing.  I was enjoying it.
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|Excellent cast, superbly selected with brilliant portrayals.<br /><br />1. Blanchett superb as she emotionally unravels dropping from her Ralph Lauren Polo/Town and Country lifestyle lady to working class-emotionally unstable- mess.  She lost her money and now goes  her mind and purpose with it.<br /><br />2. Alex Baldwin also superb as the smarmy sleazy sociopath she married, screwing people both physically and financially.<br /><br />3. Sally Hawkins as Blanchett's sister a sad, blue collar girl who's one big financial chance is wrecked by Baldwin.<br /><br />4. Andrew Dice Clay as Hawkin's husband- a decent blue collar guy - who financial and marriage are wrecked by Baldwin.<br /><br />5. Bobbie Cannavale -also excellent as Sally's new boyfriend with over tones of Stanley Kowalski.<br /><br />Without giving away the plot - the stereotypes of the ultra rich are pretty much on target.  If you are a Ralph Lauren/Town and Country/ prep school type...then do not see it.  If you do pop a few Valium first.  You'll need them.<br /><br />Bravo to Woody Allen and all the cast/crew.  I smell well deserved Oscars here.  They should make Ruth Madoff and the Wall Street bankers/vampires watch this film. Fitting.
140006922X|5.0|I read this book while touring Nazareth and the surrounding communities.  Everything came to life....again.<br /><br />Aslan continues the tradition of the gospels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent. Couldn't put it down! This book takes more twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages late into the night!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|When is Season 2 coming out?  This is the way to watch it - all episodes together instead of subscribing to Show and waiting week after week!  So suspenseful!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Fast moving. Couldn't put it down.  Well defined characters. Classically confusing with plots and sub-plots.  Would recommend to any who likes  fast-paced books.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Written in 1953, I was amazed at how prophetic AC Clarke was.  He even predicted reality tv.  I had to chuckle at his observation that people would become so obsessed with tv that they would spend 3 hours a day watching it. I also found the plot interesting and engaging with some unexpected twists. I read this book as a kid and recently reread it to see if the magic held. I did not remember what happened in the end, so it was almost like reading it for the first time. Definitely more of a philosopical piece than science fiction. His overall descriptions of characters were familiar.  These characters could exist in any time. I guess that in itself is a philosopical assessment about the nature of mankind. Overall a really entertaining read and timeless classic.  Four stars for content, 5 stars because this book so precient, was written over 60 years ago (before Sputnik ever reached the sky). AC Clarke = genius
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My grandchildren, ages 6 & 4 loved it. Would recommend it for children over 4 and up to 9 years old.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|The characters and plot were predictable and uninvolving. I would not recommend it for children due to the mindless violence. The basic plot premise, a single law enforcement officer being cop, judge, jury and executioner was not believable nor was the female character's psychic powers. Watch Looper with Bruce Willis instead.
140006922X|5.0|Intriguing and  beautifully written by this amazing scholar.  Lots to think about and discuss and fun to pass it on to others.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Along with getting to see Gene Kim give a keynote, I got a dead-tree version of this book at the 2013 Apache CloudStack Collaboration Conference in Santa Clara, CA (Thanks!). After quizzing a few folks about it and getting positive recommendations, I bought the Kindle version, as that's my main method of reading things nowadays.<br /><br />First - I feel the ideal target audience of this book is sysadmins or developers. I've been both, but have since climbed the corporate later a few rungs higher. So I was reading this book to see if I could recommend it to other dev/admin types, and I come away with a strong &#34;yes.&#34; Kim has captured the attitudes and situations of real-world companies quite well - as I read through, I was reminded of folks I know (past and present) and generally agreed with the concepts laid out to get folks out of the proverbial creeks they found themselves in.<br /><br />It's a quick and surprisingly captive read. I usually manage a few pages of a book at night before I fall asleep, but found myself staying up hours past my standard &#34;pass-out&#34; time reading this book.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, if you, your team, or IT folks near you seem to be...<br /> * Unappreciated<br /> * Overworked<br /> * Constantly firefighting<br /> * Fighting with other teams/departments<br /> * Not getting time to work on internal projects<br /><br />I'd recommend them reading this book. One of the most important things they'll learn, I think, is a big-picture view of how IT fits into an enterprise - this is something junior admins/devs usually have zero clue about, but really need.<br /><br />One con to the book: I wish Kim toned down the whole developers vs operations people thing. I know it's realistic, but I don't see value in in continuously re-enforcing the &#34;oh man I hate those developers, they always take short cuts and never get stuff done right!&#34; attitude.
B00EIL7E9C|5.0|I think season sixth was great!!! I loved how bad Bill was and how we got to see Eric in a new light. I feel that the show kept me going, I watch it every Sunday night without fail. I hope that Eric isn't really gone because I am crazy over him and I don't want to see Bill leave either. I love that Sookie finally got some wolf on her plate. To bad we missed that part. I hope that the next season is just as good. I hope that Bill gets to catch a break next season because he has been bad long enough. And would some one please kill Sarah Newlin. I am one of your biggest fans!!!!!!!!
B006K1IIAC|5.0|Absolutely love this show!  A very fresh, modern take on the concept. The DVD worked with no problems in my region-free DVD player.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John you brilliant jerk! You make your readers care for these people only to tug at our hearts. I salute you for it. Only the most amazing people can do that.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This, the first in the series of novels featuring Harry Hole, is a brilliant introduction to a brilliant, but troubled, soul. A wonderful blend of character development and smart plotting, it is a fitting start to an irresistible series. Hats off to Jo Nesbo.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|As a fan of the book, and a fan of Luhrman's previous works, I was skeptical as to how to make the two combine into a compelling piece.  I felt they really nailed it.  The story was concise, you had a good feel for the characters, unnecessary parts of the book were minimized or cut out, and the actors were very well cast.  Luhrman brought contemporary music and flashy style without letting it dominate the movie, and I ended the movie the same way I finished the book--with a deep sense of melancholy.  It is not a page by page graphic novel of the book, but it captured the essence of the story well with great acting and substance.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I love this and the BBC rendition of this classic.  The casting in the movie is amazing Keira Knightly is wonderful in her role.  And Dame Judi Dench as the Lady Katherine is just what that part needed.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This was a great series of books with unexpected twists. I would deffinately reconmend to anyone. If you liked the hunger games you will like this book!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|What I love about this movie is that it has action and adventure without being a gore fest.  The ending was a little predictable but that didn't take away from the quality of the film.
037571457X|4.0|I would give this book a 4 for a rating. I gave it this rating because this book puts a complicated, sometimes hard to understand, and to many people a boring subject; and puts it into an easy to understand book. Although it is not the most exciting subject in the world this book puts it into a story so it is not just like reading out of a textbook. The pictures help people understand what is happening better. I think this book is great for people who have no idea what the Islamic revolution is and like history told in the form of comic book.

0425263991|5.0|Loved the latest installment of the Psy-Changeling franchise by Nalini Singh.  I have been ever so intrigued with Kaleb Krychek's character from the very first time she introduced him and this book did not disappoint.<br /><br />My only wish, and it is a tiny one, was to see more involvement with the Dark River and Snow Dancers family that I have grown to love so well.  But I can only imagine how much bigger the book would have been had she done that.  Kaleb is now one of my favorite characters.

B002I9Z8B2|5.0|This is a classic Star Trek, the special effects are dated now, Shatner and Ricardo Montaban overact (well, so does everyone except Nimoy), but hey, it's a great story of revenge and friendship.  The ending is a tear jerker, but this movie is one of the best made with the original cast.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|Multiplayer is blutooth only where as all other platforms are over the Internet. Developers clearly put in lackluster effort to code this. Additionally the ability to really gather and work a fun deck through boosters is extremely limited. The developers very clearly did not put any effort into coding for Android as the battery life is abysmal when playing,  my note 2 can only maintain a charge when plugged in playing this game which shows no concern for the operating system. Developer should have to answer for these flaws publicly. Don't buy it until they at least explain lack of Multiplayer over the net.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|He continues to astonish us. Perhaps such richness requires life recaptured from the jaws of death, in any form, insignificant, heroic, ordinary. The only way to truly<br />Understand is not to seek meaning, but to live it, perhaps unknowingly, alongside death,in the myriad forms we have prepared it in, as if being its children<br />Is not enough. We pathetically embellish it in new and uglier forms to please it as our master. Is it merely in the absurd hope of being overlooked?<br />Can our barbarism be excused by fear? We are, like wicked children playing at control, pretending that if we also can mete out horrific forms<br />Of death, and attach them to some absurd belief, we are the Masters, we neatly separate those who are worthy of life from those who deserve to lose<br />It. Voila religion! Voila tribalism! Voila political systems!<br />Hosseini writes in that space between life and death, when their proximity is at its highest, and humanity is naked, on display at its best and worst.<br />That the tiniest aspect of life is dear to him is clear. He celebrates life in its most basic form, but always informed by love, in many manifestations.<br />That is finally our only power, our only sustenance, and we can only hope, that we have the courage to embrace it.<br />He continues to depict women as the backbone of life. They are more likely to have the courage to love, because the love between mother and child is a free gift from which we can choose to learn how to risk loving others. Not all of us have the courage or inclination. Young men without mothers, easily led by indoctrination and testosterone surges, enraged at their motherless childhoods, are particularly apt to find love unendurable, and become misogynous. They are no better at loving men, or children, but they do not hate them, with exceptions of course, with the fury that drives them to hate women<br />That renders women rather Necessary to all we can really accomplish in the blink of time we have .They teach us all that love is possible, and that we are all capable of this  wonder, even in the face of unimaginable loss, brutality, slavery, physical agony, hunger, and so on and so on. We can take it or not. Therein lies our Freedom to live as fully as possible or to live a life &#34;in death&#34;, bitter,vengeful, empty.<br />The background is always that beloved, rocky, cold, and often beautiful country, Afghanistan. Or is it a country? As frequently as not the tribal<br />Divisions and their war lords tear it to pieces. When they make their precarious peace, an outside invader again forces war on these beleaguered<br />People. Even Gengis Khan had trouble conquering it, and lost his son and heir. Afghanis have been fighting for hundreds if not thousands of years.<br />It is on the way to everywhere, and thus, controlling it of serious importance. Afghanis are just not lucky in their location.<br />Hosseini always feels its pulse and writes most poetically about old traditions, music,etc. It reads like an esthetic love, as well as a identity forged<br />From its finest aspects. He writes without rancor,  which is excruciatingly difficult to do given the material. He succeeds in presenting us with ,<br />A fundamental human dilemma, and all that makes it so sharp and immediate. From his perspective there is no time to waste, if the Afghani women<br />are not empowered to inform the culture with the roots if life, namely the courage to love against all odds, the culture will simply implode. Whoever<br />Dominates the country will no longer be of importance, because, Afghanistan, as it has existed for so long, will no longer be , because the fundamental<br />Reason for its survival against  such high odds will be gone. The women will be &#34;dead in life&#34; devoid of their ability uphold love as the great informer of<br />Life. The men can easily destroy each other.<br />Hosseini ends the book on a truly positive and hopeful note. It is obviously under Karzai, the Americans have driven the Taliban out, and Kabul revives for the Umpteenth time. Women are free to live their lives as they chose to. The warlords are stil in control, under new posts , but as contemptuous of the afghani People as ever.<br />Much has happened since. And I can only hope that Hosseini's eyes are better than ours.<br />It is a magnificent book on many levels. He is a superb writer, with an uncanny ability to construct plots, and exquisitely pen what is most difficult to<br />accomplish, All with a never failing underpinning of his own clear perception, which never intrudes, never becomes didactic, but is quite simply part of the<br />Lives and deaths of his well developed characters, and in the milestones of those who survive.<br />,
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Baldacci has a style of writing that grabs the reader and keeps their interest from start to finish. Will Robie weaves his way in and outside of bureaucracies. Robie dispatches his foes without remorse but runs across a young &#34;woman&#34; that gives him reasons to question his way of making a living and certain orders from his superiors. Have a seat, fasten your seat belt and prepare for an exciting ride.
1439560803|5.0|A thoroughly compelling adventure.  The character development was superb.  I couldn't put the book down and wanted to know what would happen next.  While it is fantasy, the human traits and emotions are recognizable.  I had to buy the next in the series and I am now waiting for Rothfuss to finish writing a third book.

B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is light and entertaining. The concept of using everyday items to fix things and get out of jams is something we make regular use of.

B001E7EONC|5.0|The Bank Job is everything a heist movie should be: a great plot, good twists, tension, and a great payoff. I've watched this movie twice. The first time just for fun, the second to study the intricacies, and there are plenty. Jason Stratham plays a mild mannered bad guy with a family. He gets roped into a big heist by a girl he once dated. Of course there's more to the job than simply breaking into a bank vault. There are dirty pictures of a British Royal and some spies behind the scenes. Furthermore, all does not go well for everyone involved, including some of Stratham's gang and the spies. At times this movie is light hearted, other times it's hard hitting and gritty. I don't want to give away the plot because this is a caper flick. Suffice it to say, it follows a known path but is a great ride. Stratham deserves tons of credit for being an action actor with talent and class. (I wish he would do more movies like this!) The supporting cast is equally polished, delivering excellent performances in such varied roles as wife and mother to gangster to bumbling cops and thieves. While watching this movie, pay careful attention because the scenes are short and things move FAST. You won't bog down in some silly maudlin set piece. Instead, you'll be treated to quite a few brilliant episodes with dialog that pops right off the screen. This movie is one to keep and watch every couple of months. Enjoy every minute of it, especially the end!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I loved her book.  Should not have read it first.  I then watched the whole series of Orange is the New Black and it was so different from the book.  So that's why I was disappointed.  Guess sex and lies always sell.  Oh well!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a very easy to pick up and learn game. Sessions go by super quick, which is a good thing - you don't always want to play an epic gaming session. If you're on the fence about this one, look up Wil Wheaton's Tabletop episode which features this game on YouTube.

B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I enjoyed season 3 of Enterprise because it had a single predominant story line - preventing the destruction of Earth at the hands of the Xindi, who had been manipulated into believing that humans were a threat to them.  I had missed a few episodes when this originally aired and enjoyed watching the complete season in the proper sequence.
1451626096|1.0|This book was incredibly disappointing. It was difficult to trudge through with all of the repetitive sentences and the lack of character development. But the worst part of this story is how Philippa Gregory romanticizes rape in this story. The protagonist, Elizabeth of York, is raped repeatedly and verbally abused and degraded by Henry Tudor. Yet, somehow she comes to love her rapist. If that isn't bad enough, this treatment of Elizbaeth of York can't even be explained by claiming it is historically accurate. Like most of PG's plots, this development is entirely fictional. Given the fact that this author has romanticized rape before (King Edward IV attempts to rape his future wife in The White Queen and they fall madly in love) I almost wonder if this is a type of fetishism intended to be erotic instead of deeply problematic.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is the best series to hit the air waves in a very long time. Would recommend this to everyone who enjoys mystery with a little comedy type shows.

B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|As sci-fi sequels go, this one is fantastic! I gave it four stars because Amazon needs to upgrade how it delivers movies. The movie stopped twice during playback, giving an error message that the movie could not be viewed at the time.

B000IJ7H2C|5.0|I already had this product.  I wanted tbe 2006 version of Jane Eyre, because I have collected all versions of Jane Eyre.
0321344758|3.0|I read this because it is referenced in several other design & usability titles. Overall, it's a quick, entertaining, and well-written primer for people who have little experience w/design or the internet. My main criticism is that it cannot bend space-time to remain perpetually relevant.<br /><br />I was surprised to realize how radically the internet has changed in only a few years. The 2nd edition of this book is from 2006, which doesn't SEEM that long ago ... but the examples all look ancient. Much of the specific advice on interface design conventions has since become either passe or common knowledge. It reminded me of flipping through old magazines or photo albums and laughing at how ridiculous things used to look.<br /><br />I will say that the chapter on early, iterative, affordable usability testing was a prescient & enduring section. Mr. Krug suggests a process & rationale that seems to be the foundation for modern iterative web/app design workflows, and user-centered design.<br /><br />A good book if you've read nothing else on the subject, or have recently emerged from a cave that lacked a strong 4G signal... I might suggest you get this from your local library, and look instead for his newer titles.

0553386794|5.0|I found the HBO series pretty confusing with all the characters... But still seemed to be a fascinating story.  I bought the set of books and have completed the first book, and it's thoroughly enjoyable and provides much-needed clarity with all the many characters the author has running around.<br />The HBO series pretty much sticks to the plot in the book yet despite that, I really enjoyed reading the book. Although the series on TV is great, as with all books, it fills in all the little details and I couldn't put the book down, even though I knew the story.<br /><br />Wholeheartedly endorse Game of Thrones......<br />Get it now!

I checked the second Season 2 series and all discs were repeats of Season 2.

I wanted to see beautiful fantasy-like backdrops but got &#34;ugly fantasy&#34; instead. The story line was weak.  Someone warned me that this film was marginal and not worth the price of of a ticket.  Sadly, it wasn't even worth the price of a rental on my TV as well.
1419705644|5.0|I love this book. It is funny and really informing about all the characters on the show! The fun thing is it is written by Marceline's dad and Marceline, Finn nad Jake all write comments through out the book.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|My expectations were low for this film from the word 'go'. I knew I'd be in for an action buffet with a practically nonexistong plot. However, this movie commits the biggest sin any action movie can: It was boring. Yes, there was explosions a plenty. Yes, there were over the top action scenes. And yes, there was even busty eye candy. Yet, it failed to amuse me or even hold my interest. If you've really got the need to waste an hour and a half of your life, and it HAS to be this movie, watch the 4 trailers back to back for that period of time. You'll get the same thrills and you won't really be missing anything.

0143122010|3.0|Steven Pinker leads us on a prodigious tour of human history to tell us that we *are* getting better; that the evolutionary process is at work uplifting us from our baser instincts, allowing our better angels to at least spread their wings, if not yet lift us free of our plasma.  Pinker's writing is engaging, fluid, and always entertaining.  Along the way he makes many insightful observations: his take on the Rights Revolution, as a product of our greater interdependence and exposure to others as a stimulus to empathy, has much to commend it.  (Even though he seems to think that simple empathy is not enough.)  I myself can recall the 1975 complaint of an old Ku Kluxer that \\"there just don't seem to be as many fights as there used to be.  I ain't seen a good fight around here in 25 years,\\" thus coinciding with Pinker's thesis of the postwar New Peace.  So I would *like* to believe his message of hope.  Yet, at the end of it all, his arguments don't quite convince.<br /><br />The battles of the Rights Revolution were outlined long before modern technology.  We adhere to the Rights of Man, the Bill of Rights, the Golden Rule - all crafted before the first train, plane, automobile or Ipad.  Likewise I find him engaging in familiar geopolitics.  His argument is largely confined to the West as \\"it gets better and better every day in every way\\" in Norman Vincent Peale style.  In his view (p. 85) \\"the historical Civilizing Process, in other words, did not eliminate violence, but it did relegate it to the socioeconomic margins.\\"  Yet not only does this define the Better Angels in terms of class and race privilege within Western society (and the cages of gated communities where their wings are free to flap); the crumbling infrastructure of the West finds these margins geographically and demographically expanding, until the Angels may find themselves soon at the periphery, islands of peace and privilege in a global sea of desperation and violence.<br /><br />Nor does Pinker really account for the export of Western violence.  Ideological conflict was unthinkable among Western men after 1945 - so it was outsourced to Asia and Africa, in proxy wars of genocidal proportions.  My Lai, Contras, Jonas Savimbi, Mujahadeen - where would they have been without funding, even participation, by Western men who loved peace at home while projecting their darker natures in surrogate wars upon others.  I have to blink when reading his quote of Ho Chi Minh on p. 309: \\"Kill ten of our men and we will kill one of yours.  In the end, it is you who will tire.\\"  Pinker then extrapolates that \\"the American democracy was willing to sacrifice a tiny fraction of the lives that the North Vietnamese dictator was willing to forfeit (no one asked the proverbial ten men how they felt about this), and the United States eventually conceded in the war of attrition despite having every other advantage.\\"<br /><br />Said North Vietnamese dictator is not known to have made command decisions in the Pentagon or State Department to employ napalm, cluster ordnance, nor order the massacre of thousands of civilians at a time as \\"enemy combatants\\" to beef up the body count.  Nor, to paraphrase Pinker, did anyone in the West bother asking the millions of Indochina how they felt about it.  Ho did not have to offer his people as forfeit, as the peaceful West - enjoying its New Peace and Rights Revolution - was more than happy to do it for him.<br /><br />Such vicarious violence on HBO or in \\"the margins\\" like Indochina or Iraq may look all the same on TV, and thus appear \\"harmless\\" to us.  I find it's neither, and so did the American people, finally wearying of sacrificing its own \\"tiny fraction\\" of lives.  For this reason I also find much of Pinker's book, despite his best efforts, predictably self-congratulating, even self-deluding.<br /><br />I believe I can make just as cogent an argument for the decline of Western violence in air conditioning and central heating.  Western man, raised in an antiseptic environment beyond the fundamental hots and colds of survival, can thus rise above the base needs of nature and groom the wings of his angel side.  Yet as the West declines in its ability to sustain this separation from the natural cycle - no energy to keep it at bay from his den, no snack foods to ward off hunger pangs - we may see a return to the baser cycles of the human rhythm.sed in an antiseptic environment beyond the fundamental hots and colds of survival, can thus rise above the base needs of nature and groom the wings of his angel side.

B0011Z3334|5.0|I am not a music connoisseur, but every time I listen to this Album I feel like a rock goddess. The emotion is palpable when Hailey sings and the beats can't help but resonate in your body.
B000FBJHT4|4.0|It did confirm what I did see and have read and watch on TV that we are not alone nice book a must have in your library
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and it updates by its self and it is awesome. But it used to be really boring and it used to be in version 4.0. But if you buy it you might get lucky that it will be in version 6.0. Then it will update next year maybe to version 7.1 or 7.2 :)!<br />Thanks for saying that this was a good report because this was my first report on a good game. I want to say that this is a game that you should have . Thanks bye :)
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|Brutal and scary remake/sequel to the cult classic finds a group of people trapped in a cabin fighting for dear life. This remake/ sequel lives up to the original in spades and gives us another cult hero in the character of Mia played wonderfully by Jane Levy, who gives a Tour De force performance that manages to even be better than the film itself. Be warned, its a brutal and scary film and the climax is one of the bloodiest in recent memory.<br /><br />Can't wait for the sequel.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I liked the interaction between Jamie Foxx and the bounty hunter, but the violence is perverse.  A full-face shot of a screaming man who just had his eyes gouged out.  A crippled man, begging on his knees, being pulled apart by large dogs.  A naked, screaming woman being pulled from an iron box after days in the Southern sun. I felt dirty and disgusted, and gave up after the iron box scene.<br /><br />When I saw who directed it, I had a vague feeling I wouldn't like it.  Now the feeling is not so vague.
1451626088|5.0|Still reading it, but very interesting and fast paced. I love all of her books. She seems to know a lot about english history.
0811879542|5.0|In this day and age where kids are growing up with iPads or tablets, it's so refreshing to see a book where it's not only more engaging to it's readers but also encourages interaction, development and and imagination. The book is simple but it's packed with surprises that will surely not only be fun for the little ones but for the adults as well.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|Keeps defaulting to the internal calendar and only syncs to google calendar if I reinstall it every time I add something to the google calendar . The internal calendar is useless . Glad I got it free but it does not work for me. Been fooling with it for 2 days. Will now send it to the cloud. Never to return
B004GYY714|5.0|This gives me all the stations I could not get and a whole lot of stations I didn't even know existed. I love it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works well I never needed an alarm clock but this saved me crime having to run out and buy. One
B000Y7U98W|5.0|This movie is a great addition to anyone's collection. Awesome sci-fi action with psychological thrills and chills. One of my favorites.
0375869026|4.0|I found this to be a well-written story.  It was funny, touching, and held my interest. The multiple perspectives helped the depth of the story.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|Very entertaining - great storyline. Charaters were great. Cannot wait to see the follow-on movie. One for young and old :)
B00B23O96A|5.0|Such a nice mellow groove on this CD ... his voice gets better with time, love it ... highly recommend
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I'm a young young young teen and I had gotten bored after a little bit because most of it is very random.  The beginning is intriguing and after that in my opinion it ask for down hill after that.  As the title says chatter one hundred is amazing.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This is even worse then the Silvestor Stalone's version. I fell asleep. Forget about interesting special effects and any sort of plot.
B008GJV056|5.0|A must watch! This movie is a classic! Keeps me laughing from start to finish! A must have addition to any video library!
0143124544|5.0|I finished this book in a day and a half -- and was so sorry for it to come to an end.  With  main characters that are so compelling, this novel provided an experience that I have not stopped talking about.  I recommend this book with no reservations!
B008Y73940|4.0|Well it started out somewhat slow but as it moved along it got better and I have to say I did enjoy the movie, the twist was perfect!
158542627X|4.0|Easy to read and follow. This book opens a new world of education and knowkedge for all humans regardless of religion or beliefs and explores the un-tapped powers of the human mind and brain. We constantly hear of brain power but seldom hear of how to exploit it for our own others betterment. I also gave one to my daughter and other family members.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|I loved this movie so much I had to purchase it and watch it over again....The story line is captivating and the movie moves quickly.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|I like science fiction, and this movie executes the visual effects (fairly) well, but the whole concept to me was just too incredulous. I couldn't suspend my disbelief for that long.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great fun and an even better time killer! Fun for kids and adults alike. I rate it highly and can't wait for an expansion.
B002DQLGHU|1.0|Ordered movie and it had a difficult time playing. Was constantly trying to reconnect. I waited until next day and attempted again. Same problems but time running out on movie. Got 3/4 through movie and it shuts down and offers to let me buy it again. What a waste of money!
0385523394|4.0|I saw the author on a talk show which is what got me interested in the book.  Fascinating and a good summer read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wish they would use some of these birds in angry birds friends. Cant get enough of AB! Not sure what the extras are in this game. Wish they would put a help that told more about scoring & tips
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I am not a gamer.<br />Installed in an Asus P8Z77 MB with 8 GB of Corsair 1600 memory and a 1TB SATA 3 drive.<br />It is fast and stable.<br />I am using it primarily as a weather station server (24/7) and it has plenty of CPU left to do other tasks at the same time.<br />I bought it as a replacement for an old power hog.<br />It only draws about 80-90 watts under normal operation.<br />that is about 1/3 of what the old system used.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I have seen episodes here and there over the years, so it was nice to see where Alicia began. It sets the stage nicely for what is to come.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is the only game I've enjoyed playing. Really good graphics and there's so much to do it hasn't gotten boring. It only froze on me once.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|Not easy to install , it skips to the store all the time even though it acknowleges the fact that I have downloaded it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book provided a great opportunity to give a different perspective of the workplace. I work in law enforcement and we have struggled with issues of gender and diversity. I bought several copies out of my pocket to expose my staff to other views. This book is spot on!
B00A0NOF7G|1.0|I'm a great fan of classic (christie, doyle, etc.) mystery, and of the  contemporary &#34;cozy&#34; mystery genre. I don't require my cozies to be particularly high- or even mid-brow, or to be untainted by other generic formulas (i also happen to love chick lit and rom com, both of which are freely blended with the mystery in this novel). but the mystery itself is beyond predictable (as is the romance); even reading carelessly, you'll porobably guess the ending by page 20. Beyond that I found the writing distractingly bad. the distraction is only amplified by the poor kindle conversion here, which is full of typos.
B00CKYIENY|5.0|What was there not to like?  Needless to say, this was not a first-time-read.  Austen's stories continue to be captivating.  Her style is, even in 2013, very readable.  And her witty, insightful perspective of her own place and time is fascinating for its universality.
0316247545|4.0|It came in handy for what I needed for as well as the info within the pages and the signatures it will have in it
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Some have commented that many of Aslan's positions and much of his historical information can be found elsewhere.  That is true, but he does approach the historical Jesus a bit differently from anyone else I have read.  I'm sure he brings his own experiences and prejudices to the table, but that would be true of any author.  I found this to be a thought-provoking, immensely enjoyable read.  It reinforced some of my thinking and gave me new perspectives as well. As my personal beliefs regarding Christianity have evolved, the humanity, as opposed to the divinity, of Jesus has gained importance.  I like Aslan's writing style, and I will probably read some of his other books after I finish my &#34;fiction break.&#34;
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was hooked from the first chapter.  It is a real page turner. The book was full of surprises where you change your opinion of both of the major characters and whom you believe.  I do not agree with Amy's blame of her parents for her personality etc.  The middle chapters when she is first missing did not ring true to Amy's character considering all she had done in the past.<br /><br />I did not like the ending of the book where it left you up in the air.  You have to decide for yourself the outcome.  Is this possibly left open ended for a sequel?  However the book was very enjoyable and I highly recommend it.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Grabbing and moving objects you've created is really a chore when the touch controls won't acknowledge your trying to touch objects. Also the in game enter button does not work you must use the keyboard enter button to activate a new object. The game however is delightful too bad its so hard to play on a small smartphone
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I was really nervous about this book, a new series based on Percy Jackson...He could really botch this if he is not careful, but Riordan pulled it off! This was a great book and I highly recommend it to everyone who loves the original series!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I prefer a game that tests my mental agility. This is just such a game. Challenging, addicting and over far too soon. I sincerely hope there will be many more incarnations
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series! I watched it on PBS the first time, bought series one and two, and am waiting for the local pledge drive for the radio or TV station to buy series 3.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|In my humble opinion, this movie is far better than argo (that year oscar winner movie). Very heart touching movie
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful series. Beautiful to watch, engaging story done by marvelous actors. Addicting! Very happy that is part of the Amazon Prime.
B002GHHHKG|5.0|OMG OMG he is sooooooo cute in this movie!<br /><br />watch it if you haven't!<br /><br />Love it! Watched it again and again! My favorite movie of all time!<br /><br />CAGE FOREVER!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I can be relax playing this game, because I don't need<br /> to play against the clock, try so many time is no problem. Graphic is good.
0440237688|5.0|This was a required reading book that my son has to do summer reading asignment before entering the 8th grade as thry always asign a project every summer for the kids.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun game very much so<br />Amazing graphics fun game good game playing going over land didn't know you could always new discoveries
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This games is great but I give it 4 stars because it doesn't have very good graphics<br />The game is cool though. I really like it. You should buy this game. If you like my little pony buy this game
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Mortal instruments had every opportunity  to be a great book series. In the end it made a better movie than a book
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like the game, cause its free and not only a free trial like a lot of other games. Plus you hardly get bored with it if you are into hidden objects games, cause in this game there are always new rooms to unlock and those have some nice graphics.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I'm kind of ambivalent about this game. IT'S sort of boring yet it's different then most games like it.....if there are any like it. The Hidden Object parts are fine and it's fun to have time limits sometimes but this game is just like.....there ya know....like vanilla pudding or soda crackers....you don't hate them but you don't crabs them either. If you LOVE soda crackers or vanilla pudding I'm sorry, no offence intended.
B000UIVRXG|5.0|It was a great movie, it kept me laughing the entire length of the movie.  I was very happy with this movie.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Its worth the price.  I can play for a bit then go back to it.  Haven't figure it all out but its entertaining.  My thanks to the creators, a good thing you done.  It feels like a classic.  No worries about human allies or contenders, just plain and simple.  Can't wait to see what else the creators cook up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks.  6.99 is the perfect price for the game mining tools should lAser longer.  Creepers are so cool and totally awesome
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm not even done and im already thinking of ordering another one just like this. I have been filling enjoying this so much. There are no skip buttons which I like. Puzzles keep the mind flowing and is just hard to put down.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great style of music. the song Radioactive with forever remind me of my trip to see my son in San Diego this summer. Great album.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Though it is difficult to present such fantasy to the masses. The director and writers fashioned a great story not only for nerds, but a clever tale involving bizarre characters with human faces and foibles. Great dialogue and interaction between characters and tamping down on melodrama.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. Very cute movie. Story of a robot and 4 year olds love robots!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is frustrating at times but really fun!!  If you like puzzles this is for you.  Just wish there were more puzzle rooms.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Love story for the ages..........Eastwood and Streep.........an unlikely twosome..........but somehow it really works for those two.  She is amazing as usual and he's just  well..............Clint Eastwood for goodness sake
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|don't use it much, prefer the regular games, seasons, rio, etc.  I do wish they had more levels t get to.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|True love doesn't always conquer all...........real life............refreshing...........has a good mix of drama, passion and intrigue...Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston shine
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Yes, you must make your own Happiness...the reading was inspiring.<br />I found it good reading, wish I would have read 50 years ago..
B003L77FYS|5.0|I've bought the first and second season, and now the third.  I'll keep buying each season as they come out/keep making them.  The stories (where you always forget the details and funny bits from when you watched the episodes the first time) are way more fun when you don't have to wait through a commercial break to see what comes next - even if you've seen it before, but just can't quite remember what comes next or who the killer turns out to be.  Castle and Beckett and just always so great to watch - their dynamic, but also alongside and with Esposito and Ryan.  Many a fun night in our house is spent watching Castle DVD's and this season is no exception.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|what a great movie to have in your collection. Leonardo was great,acting is terrific,and locations perfect. this must be in your collection.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love sub way surfers. It is a really fun game but I think they should give more chances to earn keys.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits easily on any stroller and it gives you the extra storage that you always seem to need when you have little ones!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Soooo fun like really you get excited and when you start giggling you know your fixed for about an hour more
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|great ,must have , keep it going ,  very very enjoyable. i loved this movie new verison to the wizard of oz
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I was curious about the game my husband was playing. The music,sound effects, & visualization drew my attention. Now we're both playing. It's going to be a challenge for me to surpass his level. I'm having fun trying.
B009RX85N0|5.0|i just love this series ,need to keep this series going. fairly tales forever , just like our childhood. what could be better. keep it up. love it.
1611761808|2.0|The book is terrific.<br />However, the Audio CD version produced by Penguin Audio is not the way to enjoy this book.  In an odd format, Penguin decided that we should have non native-English speakers as narrators.  Though the idea may sound fine in principle, the heavy accents become a distraction and actually prevent the reader from becoming fully absorbed in the story.  Imagine listneing to War and Peace narrated in a heavy Russian accent.<br />The author's voice is one of three, and is actually the easiest to understand.  But the Iranian accents of Navid Negahban and Shohreh Aghdashloo (both wonderful actors) are a constant challenge.  Though Iran shares a linguistic history with Afghanistan, that does not help the English-speaking listener who is not well-served in this recording.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|I opened this item, unrolled it, plugged it in and it almost immediately flickered as the charge would not stay connected if I moved the phone.  A few minutes later, even with the cord laying flat on the counter and connecting and charging, I received the dreaded &#34;Charging is not supported with this accesory&#34;.  Unfortunately, I am not even sure if it is a genuine Griffin product.  However, I did get a refund and I will be returning it.  My search continues for a longer, stable, lightning cable.
B00139XZF4|5.0|had this on my to do list and what a great movie... only problem now is I want to see part two, etc and I know that they will not kae any more... wish Hollywood would not make movies that do not finish without committing to the pother parts just to finish the story and not worry about making gobs of profit...
B009AY04A8|3.0|Good game but too slow with all the conversation going on. Also it is difficult to move the picture around to get the light.<br />..
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|if u liked the first you will like this better... I love the new cast and great storyline.. must see
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I'm not certain that the director or Tom Cruise read at least 5 of the Jack Reacher Books.  Tom Cruise way too short.  In movie Jack washed his clothes, jack does not wash clothes.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Edgy drama based on a historical event. Great acting keeps the viewer pinned to the screen. Definitely a mist see.
0763644765|5.0|This book has much less words per page. I just starting to introduce the idea of potty training to my 2 years old kid. The bright colors and large, simple pictures are wonderful. My son immediately started to imitate what the baby is doing. So glad I decided on this book.Helpful book for potty training kid.
B00822KWME|3.0|First of all, it must be stated that this was created solely by Mick Fleetwood, with assistance by John McVie. It contains a great many tracks from what many consider \\"The Golden Age\\" of Fleetwood Mac, which included Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, and regrettably, Lindsey Buckingham. While Lindsey's voice and guitar work have never been in question, his behaviour on and off stage as well as in the production room have resulted in some rather disastrous album sales (referring solely to the expensive-to-make Tusk which made less money due to his controlling attitude in how the double album was produced and sounded, and the album that marked his nearly ten year departure from Fleetwood Mac: Tango in the Night. Granted, 1990s Behind The Mask was only slightly more commercially successful, yet it does possess superior vocals from Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie, who were allowed to truly shine on that album, once Lindsey's controlling attitude of reining in their singing was no longer evident. Also, the entire album seems to have an excellent sound and flow, evident by the obvious shared input of the entire band in the production process, not just one member).<br /><br />Most notable on this compilation is Mick Fleetwood's unauthorised inclusion of Stevie Nicks' song \\"Silver Springs\\" (and his refusal to give the song back to her so she could put it on her Timespace album in honor of her mother, Barbara Nicks, who in fact owned the rights to the song). This led to Stevie leaving Fleetwood Mac for 6 years, returning only when Mick Fleetwood gave her back the song when the band wanted to reunite for The Dance live album and tour. This of course is a continuation of a long standing point of contention between Stevie and Mick, going back to the making of the 1977 \\"Rumours\\" album, where \\"Silver Springs\\" was originally meant to go. Mick took Stevie out to the parking lot and informed her that \\"Silver Springs\\" was being pulled at the last minute, because it was too long, and the band wanted \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" instead. The song became relegated, over Stevie's objections, to the B side of \\"Go Your Own Way\\", and Mick kept the song as stated before until 1997.<br /><br />While the fight over \\"Silver Springs\\" has ended to the satisfaction of both the band and Stevie, it is relevant to note that the song does still belong to her mother, therefore it might be more appropriate to purchase Stevie's \\"Crystal Visions\\" CD concurrently with this compilation, rather than this alone, out of respect.<br /><br />The main gems of this compilation in my opinion are the classic Fleetwood Mac songs from the early \\"Blues\\" era of the band, from the late 60s to the early 70s, \\"Albatross\\" and \\"Black Magic Woman\\" being two of the most memorable tracks from what has been considered \\"Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac\\". Including these few classic tracks from that era may seem like a waste of time considering the rerelease of the original albums dating from the late 60s to the early 70s on CD, but it is relevant to note that at the time of the original 1992 release of this compilation, all of the \\"Blues\\" era Fleetwood Mac albums were out of print.<br /><br />On the whole, despite the lengthy history lesson (my apologies to those who just wanted to know if this compilation was worth buying), this is a decent compilation with plenty enough tracks to satisfy any level of Mac fan (although the sequencing makes no logical sense and is neither chronological nor alphabetical, nor does the compilation seem to flow well at all. (This is a side note/what if/personal musing, but perhaps if Mick had given Stevie \\"Silver Springs\\" when she had asked for it, she might have been kind enough to sequence this compilation for him, as she believes that good sequencing requires a good beginning and ending, and that the songs sound good next to each other. After all, and this is a little known fact, Stevie sequenced the best loved Fleetwood Mac album of all time: \\"Rumours\\").e band wanted \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" instead.

B009MO57H6|3.0|If I judged this movie as part of the Resident Evil Franchise (games included) I would give negative starts. However, judging this book as a standalone I have to say I enjoyed it. The action scenes were great even though most of the characters were not very believable. Its an entertaining movie when you just want to watch action and guns.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This album is even better than The Sound of Madness.  I love the videos they have &#34;ENEMIES&#34; and &#34;I will Follow You&#34;.  Brent Smith has the best voice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well, it's an endless runner with similar mechanics to Subway Surfer only with more &quot;stuff.&quot; The whole game is themed around Despicable Me 1 and 2. It features power-ups, costumes, and upgrades which can be purchased with bananas. Seriously, bananas. How cute is that? Anyways, back on the topic of &quot;stuff.&quot; The game adds smart boss battles and a level-up system. You level-up to get a bigger score multiplier which (get this) MULTIPLIES YOUR SCORE. You can get a bigger score multiplier by completing in-game tasks assigned by characters from the movies. No worries parents, this game is entirely kid-friendly and is fun to play hands-down. Now, there is in-app purchasing but that can be disabled if you wish. For teens and adults, it also links up with Facebook so you can share your score online with friends and compete with each other. This is good for me because I, myself, am very competitive. Today, I played until I beat all of my friends' high scores. It's a great game, absolutely free, check it out. I highly recommend it. Show Gameloft some love for this game. Peace.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This is the simple word that sums up my thoughts on The Fountainhead. My expectations going in were that The Fountainhead would be a great book, but perhaps less than Atlas Shrugged. The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are similar in some regards but overall this book stands on its own and is just as much a masterpiece. The Fountainhead is very deep philosophically and has prompted me to reflect upon myself as a man, my place in society and perceptions of right and wrong. Just as in the real world, the world of The Fountainhead is deep and most things are not as they appear.<br /><br />Just as with Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is not for everyone. It is for those who are deep thinkers and are open to a different way of thinking. This work will likely resonate with entrepreneurs, as well as other creative, individualists who have created something from nothing. Beyond the noted depth of the ideas presented by Ayn Rand there is a truly engaging story on the surface with as little or as much depth as you would like to take the time to consider.<br /><br />The Fountainhead is an excellent book and well worth your time.
B008JFUNTG|5.0|The Gods of Olympus are the three planets: Saturn, Venus, and Mars.  The Triton is the super plasma archetype between the planets visible in the ancient skies.  Saturn is Zeus.  A comet strike Mars causes the Gods to go in chaos.  Venus appears as a dragon in the sky carrying a pearl.  Mars turns to a raging God of War raining down debris on the earth.  Saturn plasma archetypes are a triton and a venus shell.  The worlds in collision.  The planets are the Gods.  Kronos is saturn.  Kronos devours the gods, his children, is the explanation of a castrophic event.<br /><br />I liked the Cylops.  The Cylops eye represents the image of Saturn, Venus, and Mars where Mars is the pupil of the eye.  The God Ra references the three planets above the celestial pole.<br /><br />In the movie the Cyclops appear clumsy, but wants to become brothers with Percy.  There is an unique bond between brothers that is very likeable in the movie.<br /><br />The daughter of Wisdom should have kissed Percy when he used the Golden Fleece to regenerate her.<br /><br />The cyclops that ate half bloods was fearsome.  I liked the chase scenes and the dialogue between the cyclops and the half bloods.  There was alot of suspense.<br /><br />The zoombies should have been funnier.  They could have been more like the Pirates of Caribbean.  There should have been more pirate like dialogues and actions.<br /><br />The sea sirens were missing.<br /><br />The director wasted too much time having the crew traveling around on the sea.  He should have shorten those scenes and added more scenes from the book like the sirens.<br /><br />The 3 fates were funny and the special affects were clever.<br /><br />I thought Luke acted like an rich aristocrat verses a diabolical villian.  The director need to build him into a darth vader villian.  He seem more like a half blood than a vicious villian bend on the destruction of the half bloods.<br /><br />The daughter of mars was great.  She played her role well.<br /><br />I liked the battle challenge device.  I thought the scenes were entertaining.<br /><br />The advisors could have been more engaging like the Hog warts instructors.  They imparted wisdom, but they weren't as likeable.<br /><br />I felt the movie was fun.<br /><br />I liked how Percy Jackson defeated the mechanical bull.  The bull was amazing.<br /><br />I thought the Kronos type of over done.  It should have been a giant octapus, instead of a horned demon./>I liked the battle challenge device.  I thought the scenes were entertaining.<br /><br />The advisors could have been more engaging like the Hog warts instructors.  They imparted wisdom, but they weren't as likeable.<br /><br />I felt the movie was fun.<br /><br />I liked how Percy Jackson defeated the mechanical bull.  The bull was amazing.<br /><br />I thought the Kronos type of over done.  It should have been a giant octapus, instead of a horned demon.
0449000729|5.0|Loving this book so far, it's really hard to put down, I'm about 200 pages into it, I can't compare it to anything because I've never read this type of book before,but so far it's really great!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Was really excited to own this movie, and placed my pre-order shortly after the film was released this summer.  I just heard about how the greedy SOBs at Paramount have broken up all of the special features for this film. If you want all of the special features (including an audio commentary from JJ Abrams!), you have to buy the movie multiple times from iTunes, Best Buy and Target. This is nothing but a cash grab, and is anti-consumer. Shame on you, Paramount.<br /><br />For the movie, 4-stars. For the crippled blu-ray release, 0 stars.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I love how the author neatly tied the Camel Club books neatly together. It was an excellent read from start to finish.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I had never played Mahjong previous to this app and always wondered what it was. For those who are in the same boat, it's like a giant concentration game that you can change the shape of the game board on with each game.<br /><br />Fast paced game as you race against the clock.<br /><br />So many board game format keeps you constantly challenged and wanting to play more.
B00013M6NK|5.0|It's a waste of time and money to buy an off brand replacement battery for your Nikon camera. This was a high quality and affordable battery
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Great game, lots of fun!<br /><br />Good graphics, fun sound effects, controls can be used by tilting device or touch screen.<br /><br />Downside is levels are limited so game becomes redundant quickly.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game and advancing quickly however, after three weeks it would no longer work. I removed it from my device and I am currently reinstalling it now...hope it continues to work.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Not really my kind of movie, so don't go by my review.  If you are a fan, my guess is this is one of the best of the genre!
B00992CF6W|5.0|They need to make it so that if you have realms right now you should get realms beta free but it's an awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent book. Its quality drove me to tell others of the clever conceivableness of WWZ.  The social and political chaos depicted in the book is completely authentic.  I found the book's depictions of surviving humanity well-grounded in history. I'm thinking of hellish conditions like Stalingrad or Vicksburg. I highly recommend this book.
1451626096|5.0|Another great read from Philippa Gregory!  I've read all of her books, loved them all!  Can't wait for the next one!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book a lot. It had some great twists and turns, and I like the way it went from today to the past. I could identify with a lot of the thoughts of the older women.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Super addictive game! My only dislike is that this seems to be another game that would be very beneficial to spend real money while playing, but you don't have to if you just have patience! Love how there are tons of quests, there always seems to be something to do
1611761808|5.0|I really enjoyed his first book, The Kite Runner, which was read by him but not so much the second(A Thousand Splendid Suns) which was read by another reader. This book is read by the author and a woman. The reading is excellent. And The Mountains Echoed is probably the author's best written book, covering the hard choices one makes in life, the role of chance/fate, loyalty, love, devotion.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Self formats and connect quickly to PC.  Provides a good signal and priced right.  I would recommend to a friend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Some how this book lived up to the first one.  With the action,love,and mystery of the entire book made you have an opinion of all the characters.10/10
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|It is better to create spreadsheets and documents from your standard PC and transfer to your tablet then to create with this app. This app is good for viewing more than creating. But what do you expect for $14.00.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  I would read it again and again and recommend it readily to all my friends .
B0034G4P80|5.0|Lots of action, awesome backgrounds, great costumes, super effects, superb casting, interesting story, all make this movie very watchable.  I can't get enough of Thor.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|GoPros aren't necessarily designed to be point-and-shoot cameras but this device definitely makes the go-pro turn into a fairly decent fish-eye version of one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a good book.  Very funny and very moving. It draws you in and makes you care about the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing Spider while listening to Tv commercials or waiting for something to start.  It's relaxing and gets my mind refocused.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Can't say enough about how much I enjoyed reading this book.  A page turner ... not just a good story ... but so beautifully written.  Flynn has an exceptional talent.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Maybe I got too excited to play Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle. I was disappointed to see it was the guide not the game. Boooo Hoooo
B006JD48NM|5.0|I never heard of Formua 1 racing before, but this documentary on the life of this driver is an incredible and tragic story!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love this movie as I am an avid fan of Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor. I will watch it many more times
B0015AARJI|1.0|Very nice controller, but I only bought it two months ago and it won't turn on the PS3 wirelessly anymore and it won't work without a USB.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I loved this movie and the men: Muddy, Lil Water, Chuck Berry, Howlin Wolf, Willy Dixon and the others were AMAZING!!! Every one played their part good. This is a classic. I watch it a lot!
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|the game doesnt countinue when im off of it so when i get back on the game after 10hrs i have 5mins of production. I have a dinosaur I got yesterday and it should have taken 5hrs so when I wake up the next morning it says 5mins have passed so Im still waiting for the dino. it really sucks!!!!!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Is one of my favorite shows and now I'm able to watch all the one's I missed during it's original airing. Good to know it's carried by Amazon
B008YW5RH2|4.0|If only this game wasn't also a ploy to spend money in order to play beyond  the basic matches it'd be a 5 star game. But the actual game play is the best I've seen!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It worked fine for a while then it would cut off and stop working out of nowhere. If you do a search and click on a video, after viewing it doesn't go back to the search. You can't like/dislike. U can't look at related videos after the video you're watching is over without pausing the video because it'll automatically go back to the previous video. This app is just overall annoying. I would not recommend it. There is a better app called TubeMate that is just like viewing YouTube on the internet
B009AY04A8|4.0|It's not the best out there, but it will keep you busy as it has lots of hidden objects tasks/screens to resolve. A little repetitive and a bit too much dialogue.
1439156816|3.0|I felt this was very enlightening as to how a favorite author of mine writes. However, he does have a bit of attitude toward other approaches - as though what works for him is the best way for all. I found that part a bit discouraging.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Such a great book! If you have read the first two you will not be disappointed in the third. Masterfully written, exciting. LOVE IT.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is so Ellen! You will laugh and or smile on every page. Well worth reading. It is very, very enjoyable.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|An exciting Bruce Willis movie, which I always love.  Keeps you on edge of your seat and very entertaining. Would watch again
B005544TRQ|5.0|Story line is great, acting is outstanding. One of the best series on television. You won't be disappointed. Strongly recommended..
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I loved this movie, but then I love any movie that  Barbara Streisand is in. Entertaining and Hilarious, good chemistry.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Nice continuation of the saga. Plus a nice MB commercial :) If you liked previous DH series you will not be disappointed.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I love this series!  I'm not a geek, nerd or science buff, but I fell in love with the cast of this wonderful show.  I couldn't stop watching and did a big marathon.  I highly recommend this show with it's zany cast of characters.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I've always loved this movie, just hasn't seen it in years! Thanks to my kindle I was able to watch it the moment I wanted to!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Man this is a great utility. Finally I can actually search my tablet like a pc for files I couldn't find Or forgot where they were placed. And it has built in drivers to read a variety of file types.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. It's really good for all ages and being a free app is a real plus. I like how it doesn't take long to achieve the next level. The goals aren't set too hard and are fun to work on
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Love this...the arrangements, the Voice, and overall enjoyment.  Vince and Paul nail this...so many memories of wonderful songs.<br /><br />Of course...I love Buck and Merle.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|This production of _The Great Gatsby_ is an excellent reflection of the complicated lives of people on the east coast today.  Perhaps today, post-Sandy, and with global warming issues in the paper every day, we can learn the lessons herein.  _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid_ was my favorite for Robert Redford before I viewed this, and he does not steal the show here.  Excellent casting for every part.  And without a doubt, the film editing by a Priestley has aided the clear presentation of the complex issues here.<br /><br />A visual marvel.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Loved the performance of the lead actors, especially Matt Damon in this character of a young rookie attorney. Great movie that I recommend.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is the first book of his I have read. It was really good. I will be reading his other books also.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Really nice that I got a two day rental with my purchase of the ultimate two disc version so it kept me occupied until then. Was just standard quality, and a little choppy at times but I can't complain really :)
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This was a well written book that explained theories of success and what it takes. Successful people know how to take advantage of the resources available to them. The author explains his ideas and gives examples without being preachy.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is really awesome. Also good for kids that love epic. Also I love this game. Love love it.
014241722X|5.0|I bought them for my grandsons, but ended up reading them myself.  Even I, as a senior, enjoyed them very much.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This album is one of there best albums it's everything I thought it would be can't wait for volume 2 I know it's going to be awesome as volume 1 I high recommend this album to all hard and metal head \m/
0142421375|5.0|I bought this series for my grandsons and ended up  reading them myself before giving them to the boys.  Even I, as a senior, enjoyed them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun. My whole family loves it and we all challenge each other on higher scores and who gets the most bananas.
0525425772|5.0|I bought this series for my grandsons, but read the books before I gave them to the boys.  Good fiction, but I like John Grisham.
B0007OCG56|4.0|When I first saw the trailers for this film, it struck me as just a lame comedy.  The fact that Adam Sandler appeared in it just reinforced my assumption.<br /><br />In fact, this film is much more complex than I expected.  There are a few laughs, just as there are in real life, but this film is more about culture clash and family dysfunction.  It transcends easy stereotypes and treats the characters with a measure of respect.<br /><br />All the actors were great.  Shelbie Bruce, in particular, was a standout performer as the Mexican maid's daughter caught between her native culture and the temptations of the snazzy, glamorous world of her mother's employers.  And it was great to see Adam Sandler play something other than a jerk.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw this film.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|occasionally, the ads would pop after every play which is very annoying.  Other than that, it's a fun, addictive game.
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|storyline moves slowly.  I got the impression the director was trying to convey a sense of what a world full of drug-induced non-feeling people would be like, but it was tedious.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Beautiful adaptation of the classic novel. Excellent choice of actors, made the characters very real. Emma was really charming, the best I've seen in this role in my opinion. Enjoyed with my family though my 9 years old got lost in all those marriages  :)
B009AY04A8|3.0|This is a good game with lots of little side games and puzzles included, and I would have rated it higher if there wasn't one totally obnoxious feature.  Each time you finish a challenge, the dialog starts.  I don't have a lot of free time, so I play a game for the challenges, not for some story, so I always turn off the dialog to give me more time to play.  In most games, you can do it once, either in the options menu or elsewhere, and once you do that, it stays off until you choose to toggle it back on.  Not in this one.  Here, you have to hit the menu button and turn it off each and every time the screen changes.  NOT cool.  It's annoying and a total wasre of time that could be spent playing this otherwise enjoyable game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app.  So many choices of sounds.  There is a sound for your every mood, even some sounds that you don't expect.  I would recommend this app.  I think anyone would be pleased with it.
0307271080|2.0|I have read Under a Yellow Sun, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is one of my favorite authors.  So I was looking forward to this book.  Unfortunately, it didn't deliver in the way other materials I've read by her have.<br /><br />It is set both in the U.S. and in Africa.  The scenes in Africa were much clearer and more vivid than the scenes in America, which sometimes fell flat.  Also, it felt like the book needed a few more rounds of revisions and/or a good editing.  Some of the dialogue came across as weak or stilted, and some of the transitions too pat.<br /><br />I read over 100 page, but then gave up.  I still think Adichie is a great writer, and I look forward to reading her other books. But life is too short to read an additional 350 pages of work that is not at the top of her form.
B001MTENOC|5.0|I first read this book back in 1995. I recently decided to reread it after a loved one passed away. Michael Newton's is a wonderful writer the information he shares is truly astounding. This book can be a lifeline to those who have suffered a loss, opening the reader to a new confidence and optimism of the afterlife.
B002GHHHKG|1.0|This film deserves at least one star for its beautiful, touching vistas...the stirring sunrises, the soft sunsets, and angels perched on precipitous heights with Los Angeles spread out before them. However, the remaining four stars disappear in a major plot hole in this tale of an angel, Seth, falling in love with a mortal woman, Maggie.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Seth is an inquisitive angel who comes to love a woman doctor, Maggie, who he mistakenly believes saw him as a real man. Craving physical sensations, Seth freely chooses to become a fallen angel in order to have a fleshly relationship, consummating their pairing by engaging in fornication on their first night together after his change. Tragically, Maggie dies the next day, and when asked by an angel as to whether Seth's decision to fall from grace \\"had been worth it,\\" he replies that a few physical sensations of Maggie were worth an entire eternity without her.<br /><br />Here lies the plot hole...<br /><br />Seth is an ANGEL!!!!! He knows that he could have spent eternity together with Maggie experiencing a perfect, fulfilled, joyous love if he had remained an angel...yet he gives up eternal love for a carnal love!?! Simply preposterous and laid the movie to waste.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is the best information on the near-death phenomenon I've ever read. The author, Anita Moorjani, presents her amazing experience with exceptional clarity and intelligent reasoning. I believe her story and the wisdom she offers is a true gift to humanity. I can't say enough about this book and the courage and generosity exhibited by Ms. Moorjani. This book will definitely change lives and comfort souls.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|It was great music history about many of my favorite musicians from the 60's and 70's. I highly recommend it.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|This book will blow you away. It's like watching one of the BEST science fiction movies ever - the story will suck you in and won't let go of you until the last page! The futuristic setting is completely compelling and the characters and dialog are outlandish and yet human and intriguing. I can't wait to get ahold of another of P.K. Dick's novels - wow!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a very nice calculator app. Screen is large and easy to read and navigate. The color.scheme is relaxing. And helps with ease of use.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|The immense popularity of the two Ip Man movies, starring Donnie Yen and directed by Wilson Yip, made inevitable a sequel. But this is actually a fanciful prequel, starring charismatic martial arts expert To Yu-hang, also known as Dennis To, as Ip Man (1893-1972), the famous martial artist and teacher of Wing Chun kung fu. As a boy, Ip Man is advised to always focus on what you feel, not what you see. He is obviously gifted and is sent for his studies to Hong Kong. There he receives lessons in Wing Chun techniques from eccentric elderly coach Leung Bik, played by Ip Chun, real-life son of Ip Man. The young man resolves to start his own school of mixed martial arts techniques after graduation. But upon his return, his master (Yuen Biao) is outraged by his student's improvisatory kung fu, which seems to him undisciplined. These issues and personal problems must be put aside, however, due to an invasion by Japanese spies and ninjas: issues of family sacrifice and betrayal so central to HK cinema come to the fore. The climactic sequence with action choreography by Bruce Leung must be seen to be believed. Director Herman Yau masterfully oversees both the narrative arc and the eye-popping combat sequences, which will be thoroughly enjoyed by all fans of martial arts techniques. This combination Blu-Ray and DVD has supplements featuring brief interviews with cast members. In Chinese with English subtitles.
0395925037|3.0|THIS BOOK IS WORTH READING FOR HISTORIANS.  OTHERWISE IT IS A LONG WINDED TEXT BY HITLER. OTHER BOOKS WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE PERIOD FROM THE FIRST WW TO THE 2ND WW.. I would not recommend the book for the general public, It is not written by an intellectual. Hitler had a  mediocre education as evident in his writing and the text is loaded with prejudice assumptions.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I rarely buy a movie but am buying this one. The photography is stunning and the story and music are uplifting. If you think the movie is only for old people; well what can I say, just hope you make it there someday<br />!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|boring, mindless movie that went no where.  Cruise acted like he was bored to be in the movie-came across as a low budget, weak script flick that had no message-worst Cruise movie ever!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved this movie it was well done and I would watch it over and over again.. I bought it for my mom
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|If you liked the first movie you'll like this one. However, they entire movie takes place in a apartment tower.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A very good read with a lot of turns and twists. A book that will hold interest all the way through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it is the best game on my device and it is the funnest game i just love it
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great app. It is so much easier typing on this calculator than on a smart phone. However the ads are distracting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn t put it off until the end... and after the end, am said that it is over... Can t wait for the next movies!!!
B00000DLV1|1.0|This one star rating is no reflection on the band or quality of the music generally, rather it is a rating of the product that includes its marketing and product placement and the integrity thereof. So I feel this a legitimate review of the product.<br /><br />I bought this CD as I particularly liked the Portishead Roseland NYC Live version of 'Sour Times'; the version on the DVD and the one on YouTube.  I bought it because I thought I would honor the artist by buying the product instead of just going back to the YouTube version for free.<br /><br />Unfortunately the 'Sour Times' version on this CD is quite different to the NYC version on the DVD and YouTube, apparently the CD version was recorded in San Francisco and is quite distinct in its approach.  This was a big disappointment for me and significantly and adversely affected my enjoyment to the tune of 4 stars.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|There is nothing like suspending your reality for long enough to enjoy a Star Trek film. This one does not disappoint! By having the saga begin with a Spock/Uhura romance only adds some texture. The development of Mr Scott is purely entertaining and of course, Dr. McCoy is pure, credible entertainment. I never thought that I would get used to the newbies, Never did I conceive of anyone but William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as the Captain and his overqualified first officer. But Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have nailed it. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Now,I have to go to the theater to fully appreciate it!
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Stylish look at a future where the proles are universally drugged to keep them docile and controllable. Regretfully, the script is confusing, the characters are one-dimensional and their conflict is not engaging.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What an excellent book. I cried at such a beautiful story. Read it and I know you will love it too.
0307730700|5.0|I am a great admirer of those who serve in our Armed Forces but am in awe of anyone who has the strength and determination to make the grade of Navy Seal.  This is such an awesome true-life story that I have purchased 5 additional copies for friends and grandchildren.
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|Moves a bit slow but I really enjoyed the story! Very good acting. Give this movie a try! 4 out of 5 stars
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Awesome !!! It just keeps getting better and better as I listen to it more.<br />Little bit of Metselloutitica(old)/Megadeth and blues metal with Newsted's touch. Excellent !!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not too hard. not too easy. ready for more levels. this is one of the better free apps that I have tried.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|If you love Devil Driver, it is a must own !! If you are lame and don't own any DD.....you are a loser and need to purchase NOW !!<br />Full Throttle DD !!! I pre-ordered and saved some cash, but this is worth at least $30 it is excellent.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Not the best superhero movie but the best exposition into the world of comic mythology. Well done by the lead choice.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so FUN. I can't stop playing it. My friends always ask if they can play this game when I come to their house.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great game for almost everyone really realistic and just overall a good game everyone should get it because I got it
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|\\"America is an irradiated wasteland. Within it lies a city. Outside the boundary walls, a desert. A cursed earth. Inside the walls, a cursed city, stretching from Boston to Washington D.C.

B00COMLLX2|5.0|I love this game buy it you will not be disappointed. It is challenging and not boring at all. Marvel at its best!!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This is a rip off. Amazon should discontinue this product as misleading.<br />Live Streaming of TV there is definetly more channels than what they listed in the USA. Very misleading.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Hard to follow at times but with the great acting and stunning scenery and special effects it is well worth the effort.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|Well, first of all, Normal sand you can clump together into a ball, roll it around in you hands and make a little sand snowman out of it, sit back and admire your lack of artistic skills... well, Not this stuff.<br /><br />You can clump it together into a ball for about six seconds, and then it starts to escape, crumbling at ever increasing speeds till your ball is a mass of instant erosion.<br /><br />If you roll it around in your hands, it begins dribbling out the gaps, as if waiting for the first chance it gets.<br /><br />If you make a little sandman, it quickly crumbles, as if pointing out the futility of your attempts at order, gleefully demonstrating entropy.<br /><br />If you tightly pack it into a low center of gravity mass and stare at it... well, it just lies there and does nothing.<br /><br />But if you attempt to add height to that mass, it mocks your attempts.<br /><br />This is sand that does not behave well.<br /><br />It's very naughty sand.
B0091QS88K|3.0|I really liked cooking and sitting the animals down at the tables but it sometimes didn't work and it took up a lot of space. so I deleted it but decided to try it out again and I liked it alot
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I don't know how they do it, but Shazam is one of the most incredibile apps I am using. Doesn't matter where you are, car, home, store, bar, wherever, should you hear a song that you know, but just dont quite remember the name or who did it, this app will figure it out for you. Fast.<br />Simple to use, you hit the \\"Listen\\" button, and it works for a few seconds and \\"Shazam!\\" you have the album cover, name of the song, and the artist. I use it on my apple devices. Incredible technology and always impressed when using it. Highly recommended for audiophiles or anyone who enjoys music.
159463176X|5.0|I thought this the best of the 3 books by this author .In this book, like the others, we get a glimpse of his native country and customs.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I really like the note app. When I think of something I need to remember my phone is always with me and I am able to make the notation before I forget. It's a great app.
1567184855|4.0|This is a book that will make you stop and think. Interest in the everafter has been in most of our minds, if only fleetingly. Could what Newton is saying really be the eventuality?
0060191325|5.0|The book was a great price, it shipped quickly and was in excellent condition. Everything a buyer could want. The content of the book is great but like anything, you only get out of it what you put into it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Hysterical flick and great music! So funny cute story line, my 11 year old daughter and I  have watched over and over again! We laugh and sign along each time! Great for family night or just when you are feeling blue to cheer you up!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|First book by this author that I have read.  I plan to go back and read the previous two.  The plot ,was a,little hard to follow with all the shifts in time and location, but some of the writing is just beautiful.  A sad but happy tale.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app has much more than the standard alarm on my Android phone. I love the different clocks and sounds. You can wake up to Mountain sounds or your own music and you can fall asleep to the White noise. This Alarm is great for anyone even to just check the time and Weather!
B003QSPO9K|1.0|I ordered this movie from my Tivo Premier XL device. The movie downloaded sometime during the night. When I attempted to watch the movie the next day, the movie stopped playing at the 39-minute mark. I tried to fast-forward past the bad spot, but the movie never went any further. I rebooted the Tivo and tried again. Same result ... the movie stopped at the 39-minute mark. I went to the end of the movie and tried to scan backwards to the 39-minute mark. The movie still would not play.<br /><br />I could not find any place on Amazon.com to get a refund for this movie or even report a problem with the download process.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The author made katniss weak and I didn't like it she kept second guessing her self and very overly emotional. And the fact that the author decide to kill Prim was lame when I read that part I wanted to stop reading but I had already bought the book so I had to keep on reading how this now lame ass book was goin to end  and it got no better she never talks to Gale again or seen her mother. I thought putting her and Peeta together wasn't a good choice thumbs down on that. I read the second book catching fire and jus love it goin into the three book I expected nothing less than great but it didn't compare its been three weeks sence I finish the book and I'm still disappointed.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Yes, the actors look like fun- my wife enjoys Cox and Mirren flirting. Willis makes his fights look ridiculously easy. Malkovich holds his own as a marksman. But there is a plausible reason for them to join together; a dirty weapons dealer and a political secret.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|I've collected LPs for many years and have some very good first and or early pressings of the Beatle albums. My experience is that my new Beatles set  LPs are very competitive with my early Mobile Fidelity pressings of several Beatle albums with the exception that the bass is tighter and the sound is a bit more transparent in detail, yet less harsh and smoother at the same time.<br /><br />Reading other reviews, clearly some sets had pressing quality problems. Perhaps the sheer volume of projected sales exceeded the production capacity of the first tier pressing houses and some production was farmed out to lower quality pressing houses.<br /><br />In terms of the digital masters used in these pressings, there may be valid points made, but generally almost all LPs in the analog tape days were produced from \\"pressing masters\\",  several generations removed from the true master tape. Additionally, the pressing masters  often had boosted high frequencies to offset the common \\"rolloff\\" of high frequencies caused during manufacturing.<br /><br />All of the master concerns leave open the possibility for a high grade redo from a firm such as Mobile Fidelity using the true high resolution digital masters. I'm personally glad I have not waited for that possibility. Amazon has a very good return policy so I recommend the set and suggest any buyers with problems reach out to Amazon. I think they will make the situation good for you if you get a box set with problems. I'm very happy with my set and the book that came with the set is excellent.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I am not in the typical demographic for a Taylor Swift fan - I am 60 and male, and I never  thought I would have any use for her music. This CD changed that. I heard a couple songs and ended up buying the CD and eventually fell in love with every track. Almost a year later and I play this CD more than ever, almost every day. I ended up getting all of her previous CD's, even the Christmas one and Beautiful Eyes, and while there are wonderful songs on each one, \\"Red\\" is the first one that is flawless. Taylor is a natural songwriter, with a very good lyrical sense, and her voice has improved, and the music itself has grown way beyond the country-folk pop of the earlier albums. I saw her Red tour in Chicago and it was the best concert I have seen in all my years. I can't wait for he next CD! And her next tour!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't write book reviews.  It isn't my place to influence others before they read.  And I personally prefer as much mystery as possible before reading.  But if you are looking to be swept away into beautifully honest characters that make you wonder what you would do in virtually every scenario, then I hope you will be as fascinated, enchanted and surprised as I was.
0385528787|4.0|\\"MaddAddam,\\" the last book in Margaret Atwood's dystopian trilogy set in a world beset by predatory corporations, plague, and environmental disaster, is like one of those musicals in which everyone comes on stage for the final number. The characters from Oryx and Crake\\" (2003) are here, even Oryx and Crake themselves, if only in myth. The same is true for the characters from \\"The Year of the Flood,\\"(2009) although in the new novel Zeb now takes the lead. If you have not read the earlier books, forget about \\"MaddAddam\\" for a while.<br /><br />Yes, Atwood does begin with a reprise, \\"The Story So Far,\\" but it is not enough. I had read both of the earlier books, but still found myself frustrated by constantly trying to remember events from those novels. Atwood herself seem aware of the problem, as she regularly weaves in little reminders of the previous action.  Finally in frustration, halfway through, I resorted to Wikipedia summaries of \\"\\"Oryx\\" and \\"Flood.\\" That helped, and you may, like a student sneaking a peek at SparkNotes, find yourself doing the same.<br /><br />The interesting thing about \\"MaddAddam\\" is that all of the \\"types\\" of the previous books--the Gardeners, the genetically engineered pacifist Crakers, the scientists, and the people, like Zeb, who move among these types, find themselves sharing the same refuge, along with a bunch of gene-spliced animals. It's rather like Noah's ark, except that the \\"flood,\\" a pandemic, has already happened. In these tight quarters, as the inhabitants must get ready to defend themselves against the murderous Painballers, Atwood asks this question: what sort of world will arise from the remnant of humans and quasi-humans that still survives? Jealousy flourishes in the compound. Ethical debates (capital punishment, abortion) arise. Even as weeds and kudzu break apart the ruined cities, trees and shrubs commence flowering, and bees return to human hives, the humans themselves seem to be reproducing true to type----or maybe not, if one considers the interspecies cooperation that sets up the final battle.<br /><br />\\"MaddAddam\\" ties up most of the loose ends from \\"Oryx\\" and \\"Flood,\\" but it only makes sense if you read those two first.<br /><br />M. Feldmant, if one considers the interspecies cooperation that sets up the final battle.<br /><br />\\"MaddAddam\\" ties up most of the loose ends from \\"Oryx\\" and \\"Flood,\\" but it only makes sense if you read those two first.<br /><br />M.

B0083Z614S|5.0|I purchased this for my Kindle, for my granddaughter to read while she was here visiting.  It was a huge favorite of mine when I was a youngster and I know I read it dozens of times!
B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|Love the movie and I'd sure love to have the extended edition, but I'm not buying it for just 13 more minutes of movie.  I can wait until the set comes out.  I'm a very patient woman...  I have more patience than money, that's for sure.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app and how easy it is to buy, sell and browse! I haven't had any problems with this app, which is unusual. It seems like most apps have some kind of problem- the app freezing, shutting down, not opening. But not this one... it's perfect! You can do everything in the listing without even having to go to the website.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's fun but sometimes it just sucks and the price shouldn't  be $7 really come on that is not right
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Love the fact that it is easy to use.  I didn't realize that the Kindle could be &#34;cleaned up&#34; until getting this app.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A bit expensive to get going, but fun when the city starts chugging! I like working toward the bigger projects, like the airport.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This has been so handy for me to quickly review my son's homework and classwork.  Was so pleased to actually get it as a free app, but well worth the money if you pay for it.
B00DU74U74|3.0|Not great, but fun to watch.  I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't have. Paid theatre prices to see it.  Ok for older kids
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Darius is so &#34;real&#34;! These songs are such a blend of the &#34;Hootie&#34; Darius and the new &#34;down home country&#34; Darius. Vocals and instrumental music are stellar!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Typical sci-fi.  Not great, but not horrible either. I Would not pay theatre prices to see this movie.  Not great for young kids
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this game a lot.  Enjoy the interaction with other people.  Keep up the good work with this game.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Lots of fun to watch.  I would even let my kids see it.  I will probably rent the second one also
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book a great deal. It's not perfect, but the writing is good and keeps you turning pages. The situation is perhaps a little forced, but it feels fairly honest as you are reading it. You root for all the characters even though they are deeply flawed -- who isn't? -- and in the end (minor spoiler alert) it all works out pretty much as you would hope. It's not a surprise, but it is satisfying. Definitely worth the time.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. There were parts that I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants. The romance story was awesome and the erotic scenes were sizzling. Emma Chase certainly knows how to write a fantastic book. Highly Recommend This Book.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|good fun can't wait for more floors. The challenges are varied enough to keep one thinking.  good luck and have fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is like temple runner x 10. there is so much more to do and the game gets progressively harder as you compelte more distance in the game.

0786888628|5.0|Great writing coupled with sophisticated, blunt understanding of the war and history.  He's to the point while fully explaining any situation - be it a battle, geo-political movement, or simply how humans relate to one another.  The Korean War should be far more understood by all, this book delivers that, while being immensely entertaining to read.
B005LAII80|4.0|The movie itself was better than I thought it would be. Good action, reasonable plot; violent, but fun. I wish there was a DVD included in this combo pack, though.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very fun game, it's addicting...just got it and haven't stopped yet. The only bad thing I have to say is that sometimes the items are small and when you try to zoom in it takes as you pressed incorrectly and then you get docked points.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|good kinda like magic<br />and its free aaa&ntilde;nnnnd funnfornevery one whooox<br />and and and and andand andj andfun fun fun fufn
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|But I love it. Neat period piece and greatly helps in understanding the old system of aristocracy.<br />Very interesting to see the caste system that the servants adhere to as well.<br />Characters are real and draw you in for good or bad.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book took me through an epic adventure and battle with Percy Jackson and all his friends, family and allies.

B0087EVHVW|4.0|My PC boot in just 5 seconds using windows 8, and 16 Gb of RAM.<br />Great price and great Quality.
B0010Z32OA|5.0|I just love everything about this movie. I'm even willing to overlook some of the &#34;movie mistakes&#34;. It has adventure, romance, action, true love and more! The book was terrific also, I recommend both!
B0090EJ99A|4.0|Pushing the politically incorrect buttons in a unique humor that perhaps not everyone will see as that funny. It was refreshing, he was PI on all sides to be fair and made a few good points.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's fun and fast paced. The only problem is the wasting of the powerups. Also the bingo coins to fast.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|We had low expectations watching this but enjoyed it and laughed!  It was great and had funny lines and great action!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I liked it so much I bought it.  A beautiful/tragic history enacted by fantastic actors. Plot and characters all strong. Outstanding music.  A testament to Iguazu Falls and the native people who lived above it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't get enough of this show. Can hardly wait for next season to be available. The story line is great!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Such a wonderful series, although I'm a bit disappointed with where I think they're heading (don't want to reveal too much!).  Can't wait for season 4.
B000GFLKEY|5.0|well done... good cast, plot & execution. wlii watch and reccommend as a classic Denzel film... saw it BEFORE buying.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I did like this book but found it a little disappointing after reading The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns . They were both amazing stories and I read them twice..Don't think I will go back to this one !
B00881VLCE|5.0|Awesome jigsaw puzzle game. Love the make your own puzzle option
B00DIJ49UW|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack for an excellent movie! A killer soundtrack like is what you need for a kaiju movie and that is what Ramin Djawadi delivered. From the opening theme entitled Pacific Rim, you know you're in for one heck of a musical ride!
1400079276|5.0|I read 1Q84 last year and Kafka on the Shore is very similar in theme and content yet the characters are very different, and the former is a much longer novel. Indeed, I found the Dickensian detail in 1Q84 to be tiresome at times. In this sense, Kafka on the Shore is a better novel, more compact and focused. Also, the heroes of Kafka on the Shore are more endearing and empathetic than are the heroes of 1Q84 who are somewhat cold and distant until late in the narrative. However, 1Q84 is a great novel, it just needed a great editor but Murakami has achieved such a level of renown that no editor dares can tell him what to do anymore. I don`t know how much editorial input there was in the creation of Kafka on the Shore but it is the greater novel for me. Murakami has been one of the great literary discoveries of the last few years for me and I have never been disappointed by his work and I can`t wait to read another one of his books.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This was an awesome opening to the whole story! I really enjoyed every last word of it.  It is a very well thought out story.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Spoiler free review:<br /><br />The story is about Judges that are unbelivably outnumbered and overstreched in a post apocalyptic urban jungle.<br /><br />The story deals in large part with a drug (slo-mo) that hyper accelerates your perceptions, and the bad guys who make money from it.  Not a spoiler, you see the drug work in the first minute or so.<br /><br />Dredd gets an extremely cute rookie to train for her first day, and they drop into hell.  This doesn't turn into a budding romance or anything of the sort, and if you're looking for Dredd to kiss anyone, you'll need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Many scenes use the drug to slow down perception, and the soundtrack gets underclocked to match, producing the eerie, ethereal, hauntingly beautiful music produced by slowing it down.  I have no doubt the drug idea movie was inspired by the famous Justin Bieber song \\"You Smile\\" slowed by about 30:1 that's floating around the internet.<br /><br />The action is extremely brutal and ugly, kind of like what happens in real life when really, really evil people amuse themselves.  Seeing people get shot graphically in ultra slow motion takes away the romance of neatly mowing down rows of anonymous villians, though we were pretty much spared the screaming.<br /><br />Judge Dredd fans: If you want to see what life would really look like in your hero's world, here you go.<br /><br />Five stars.
B005544V6A|5.0|Why do you insist that I must fill out these boxes?  I am very happy with Amazon's products, but find it curious that it isn't good enough for you that I indicate by the # of stars my level of satisfaction.  I really wish you wouldn't do this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it on the amazon appstore and on google play. Its a really fun game and i also have it on pc and xbox.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's missile command. It's fun. It brings back memories of the first time I played it sometime in the '80s. What more is there to say.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I love Jay Z ...but his songs in the movie threw me off a bit. It's a good remake though
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|Avenged has basically written the album that Metallica should have written after the black album. It's mid-tempo metal that sounds quite a bit like old school Metallica. I like it, but you might be disappointed if you go into it expecting the same old A7X. The closest you will get is on the bonus track, St. James. That actually sounds like older material.<br /><br />For everyone claiming this is due to the Rev not having anything to do with this album, the new drummer sucks, whatever: Go read some interviews. This is what the band was aiming for. They wanted to do an album with more of a classic metal feel. If you think the new drummer, Arin Ilejay, can't play the old style, you are mistaken. Take a listen to the single they did in 2012 for Black Ops II, Carry On. Or listen to them in concert. He's good. He's no Rev, but who is?
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is a very good app! I am always on Pinterest  looking for new crafts ideas so now I can do it on my tablet and on the go! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen, definitely in my top 3! Even if your not crazy about zombie stuff, this show is still amazing!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun app. Some are very easy while others stump you. Worth it to download although hints cost too much coins
B005OK722U|4.0|I am not going to go into detail as so many of the great posters but suffice it to say, I did not find this as bad as a couple of the reviews.  I guess my favorite will always be #1 but as they make them, I will buy them because I do enjoy these.  This had some frightening parts and a couple scenes had me wondering.  I enjoyed it and would recommend any Hostel fans to purchase it.
B008G33PMI|5.0|love this singer love this album looking forward to the next album. I would tell my friends to buy this album
B0083I90HU|5.0|Fantastic book!  I highly recommend Sarah's Key, you will not want to put it down. You will probably never forget Sarah's Key.
1444777556|5.0|A wonderful true story about a stray cat and it's impact on a desperate man in need of a companion on the streets of London. Thoroughly enjoyable!
0062255657|5.0|An engaging story that is hard to put down, even though it's steeped in fantasy. Maybe even because of that.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Helps me stay on track and organized with my busy schedule. It is also fun and easy. I would recommend to friends.
1781162646|5.0|This is the kind of book you don't want to put down and wish would never end. Stephen King has always been a favorite of mine, and this is one book I think will be a favorite.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had always heard this was a good show, I am now convinced!  I am totally sucked in and can't wait to watch the next season!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|what more can be said.  The judges are worse then corrupt cops we have today. More innocent deaths caused by judge involvement then without.  Just a movie however based on a comic so who cares.  What a let down. This movie is a total rip off of the Indonesian film The Raid Redemption. Except that movie had way better action.
B002E8B212|5.0|This is a nice view of SRV connecting with the previous generation of blues. Great music and interesting conversation from two legends.
B0043H2V2Q|5.0|This is a good zombie series. A classic zombie adventure. Let's kill all the zombies. Cute girl killing zombies, classic
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Without giving anything away...transformation is always uplifting, but especially so when it makes a family stronger. This film is definitely gives you that jump-out-of-your-chair-and-cheer-for-the-hero feeling. It's got great energy in the second half. The first half gives you some gut wrenching when you watch the poor choices of Jackman's character, but the end justifies it.<br /><br />Great movie when you need to see somebody learn to win.
0446582778|5.0|I've become a big fan of the Harry Bosch novels, and I've now read about ten of them. In this one, author Michael Connelly once more does a fantastic job of weaving a first-rate crime novel and murder mystery, filled with hard boiled characters and dripping with staples of modern noir. The plot of this Bosch novel was particularly compelling, in that it dealt with the murder of an extremely high profile individual (a lawyer who was polarizing and inflammatory in life - and even more so in death).<br /><br />Like a master story teller, Connelly slowly doles out the clues and the complications as the tale progresses, and I was hooked the entire time. Just when I thought I had things figured out, and the story might winding down, another element would come into play, further complicating the web that Harry and his partners have found themselves in.<br /><br />As I mentioned in the title, this book can at times be somewhat terrifying. This is because it oftentimes discusses the horrific 1992 Rodney King LA riots, and the police are trying to prevent a similar riot from happening in their fragile, emotionally charged city over the course of \\"Angels Flight\\". I could feel the growing desperation in the characters as they tried to avoid this terrible fate, and I felt like I was right there in the boiler with them. Awesome job by Connelly!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Not many options unless you want to spend a boatload of cash. What a shame because this could be such a great game. You should be able to play this without having to spend money. Really??? 50-100.00 to play! Sickening!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Played with my 20 month old and she really loves it, especially the sound effects and the popping of the balloons.  Very well done, especially the little details.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very nice and easy program to empty your cache and get rid of useless files on you Kindle Fire HD.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther is very entertaining.  John Corey is a comedic powerhouse onto himself.  I found myself laughing aloud at times. Thanks Nelson.
B003TO5414|5.0|Great characterization, storytelling, and acting.  Smart, intriguing, and funny.  It is definitely a must try for fans of the original stories.  I can't wait for the third season to start.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series ever. Equally as good as Season 1. Just don't start it if you're planning to do anything else - you'll be hooked.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is a sad but exciting book and I loved reading it. So I strongly recommend this book for ages 10 and up.
B00338QENI|4.0|The way the author stuck with the story, and got into the lives of the family members was very impressive.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|VERY clever little game.  First time playing one of these and it was hard enough to keep me guessing ( the hint button VERY useful), but not so hard I ever got frustrated.

B003VTZXD6|5.0|This book makes a great starting point for a Processing beginner, from one of the originators of the language. Highly recommended.
B005HED08I|5.0|Just the way I remember the series when I was much younger and when I watched it after school on week days. The episodes are worth watching over and over again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks writes very interesting and easy to read novels.  I enjoyed this novel as well as other books written by this author.
140006922X|5.0|This was a gift for a friend in Florida,who is a Christian.I had seen Mr.Asian interviewed 3 times,and have read 2 of his books.My friend loves this book because it takes a different view of the many prophets,during Jesus lifetime.The book was new,packaged so that the book was in excellent shape,and it was a fast mailing time,and she says that she buys from Amazon.com.frequently,but had not seen this book offered in her small town.So,this is a wonderful gift for her.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I got this app. Cause I love pinball and was looking for another fun game. WINNER .... Found a great game. The tables you can buy are awesome. Lots of Star Wars and Marvel comic tables to buy. I started with the Ghost Rider table and will get Thor next.  HAPPY.... : )  awesome
B007TK77QE|4.0|As opposed to all the negative reviews for The Casual Vacancy, my opinion for the book is that it is one of JK's yet another good books.<br /><br />Yes, it's not action-packed but no, it's not boring. Reading the book is like gliding through a calm river; it flows, it's smooth and it was a very nice ride I really enjoyed.<br /><br />The characters were very real and natural and life-like. It was like reading about a neighbour I knew of or something like that. JK made up this world in suburbia that was very familiar and close to home that it very easy to connect with each character even if I did not have anything in common with them. She has this magical way of writing that makes you know the character so well that you end up sympathising with them even if you hate them.<br /><br />So all in all, the book is great! A must read!
B009NSHZLW|3.0|I think that it plays the songs well but I don't like the way that it assembles the songs I with it assembled them in alphabetical order instead of when you downloaded them
B00969GFFU|2.0|This book was very tiring to read.<br /><br />I did not enjoy reading this book because it of the slow-paced character development. It was too slow for my enjoyment and everything was everywhere. I did not like the mixed events that I am sure the writer tried to incorporate in the book for some effect but it just ended up confusing me. It was frustrating reading from start to end that I had to force myself to finish it.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is very interesting and surely makes your eyes and brain work hard.<br />It is a kind a game that can keep you busy and helps you improve your concentration.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome! It is very addicting and easy to play! Appropriate for any age to play! Give this game two thumbs up!
B007MD2RHC|4.0|CD is great, but the last 2 track are damaged with a scratch and water marks. what more can I say.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is the most like the version I am used to playing on my laptop.  I now play it on my Kindle Fire HD which is more easily portable so I take it to work with me.  Yes, I also have a great Job!  Love both!
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I expected to love this product, but I find that it often loses its connection over Bluetooth to my iMac.  I can usually get it back by moving and clicking, but it's still undependable.  I switched back to regular batteries, and the lost connection problem disappeared.  Now I thought I'd give this one more try.  Installed and charged it, and once again I'm experiencing connection problems.  Very disappointing.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|I love the Amazon mp3 player! It's easy to use & I love having my entire music collection right there on the cloud for download anytime I like. The app is large but it allows you to move it your phone's sd card. Which is nice because my phone's internal storage is limited. However... I bought a 32gb sd card for my Droid X2 to have more room for music only to realize, after downloading a good portion of desired tracks from my extensive cloud music collection, that Amazon mp3 player will only download to my phone's internal storage. How can this be rectified???

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent writing and acting. I truly understand the uproar of Stevens' leaving however I enjoyed the acting of Maggie Smith and even the guy who played wiley Thomas more. Dame Smith stole every scene she was in even though the scenes were seconds long. Anxiously awaiting S4. One question? Why did they make Shirley McClain look so &#34;raggedy.&#34; She was difficult to watch

B000JMKQX0|3.0|A different kind of story for me. About a zombie invasion that takes over the world. It tells about how each country deals with the zombie outbreak and the effects it had on the people and the country itself. The story kept me intrigued and wanting to know what is going to happen next. I liked that this story was told in a series of interviews about people describing what happened. For me this was a good story and now I think I am ready to tackle another zombie tale!

B007IX00ZC|5.0|I'm into both academic music and rock music (e.g. I love both Schnittke and Dream Theater).<br />I heard about this band from a friend about a year ago, checked out this album on youtube (I'm now buying a CD to put it in my car), and from the first minutes it became clear to me that I'm listening to incredibly talented music that's going to become legendary. I'm glad to see, from others' reviews, that this is a universal opinion.<br />Now that, after a year, there's hardly been a day that I didn't listen to one or two full albums without being bored, I can say that this is my favourite contemporary non-academic music.<br /><br />So, what do I like about this?<br /><br />This is a crazy blend of styles - metal + opera + jazz + tango + whatever, blended so well that it becomes its own style.<br />The music is just extremely well composed. I wish I had been a composition student to be able to analyze it, but even with my rudimentary music education I see that the compositions have a perfect flow that's like storytelling, while being intriguing and diverse at every moment (this is in contrast to many popular songs which are often a repetition of the same simple motive, with a solo if you're lucky).<br />It's a very rare quality in music that, no matter how close you look (the overall motive, or individual notes), you find something interesting at every level. The rhythm is interesting, the melodies are interesting, the accompaniment is interesting, the singing is interesting.<br /><br />Probably the best tracks to understand just how good the music is, are \\"Voodoo mon amour\\", \\"Black box messiah\\" and \\"Honey trap aftermath\\". Make sure to also listen to the other 2 albums - \\"Butcher's ballroom\\" and \\"Sing-along songs for the damned and delirious\\" (the \\"A tap dancer's dilemma\\" will give you an even better impression of their style, and \\"Stratosphere serenade\\" is mind-blowing - make sure you listen to it to the end).

Since that time  I of course have grown (as has Star Wars!) and my husband and I have shared our love for the movies with our children. Over the years we have owned the movies on VHS, DVD and now on Blu-ray and the Blu is by far the best (second to sitting in the theater of course). With this collection I have all of the movies and some awesome bonus features in one compact case.

B00AZMFJYA|2.0|This review will contain some minor spoilers, you have been warned.<br /><br />Despite doing a \\"reboot\\" with the 2009 film, to explain why Abrams could ignore 40+ years of Trek lore, JJ goes back to Trek lore for this movie.<br /><br />The special effects are of course up to par with Hollywood big budget films.  If all you're looking for is eye candy, then you'll enjoy this film.  If you have only seen the 2009 movie, and no other Trek media, you will enjoy the movie.  However, if you are a Trekkie (or Trekker) you will be disappointed and possibly upset by how Abrams further butchers Trek lore.<br /><br />The set up of the film is the Enterprise hiding under water while Spock goes into an active volcano.  There is then a big scene where Kirk has to violate the Prime Directive to save Spock by revealing the ship to the natives. WHY the Enterprise would submerge under water makes no sense.  They would be safe in orbit and could easily beam Spock out, yet JJ Abrams (who is doing his thing and to heck with the lore), creates this absurd situation just so Kirk can get demoted (briefly) later in the film.  You could delete this entire scene and it would not affect the story at all.<br /><br />Plus Kirk is further portrayed as a reckless, rule-breaking, bad boy contradictory to the character we've seen since the Original Series.  I cannot fault Chris Pine as he does a good job given the script.  However, before this film the number of times Kirk broke the rules could be counted on one hand.  Here, JJ Abrams has a Kirk that makes one wonder why Starfleet would have him in the first place let alone captain of the Enterprise.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is basically Star Trek II, with some tweaks.  JJ Abrams continuing his trend of his films taking cues from other movies.  The ending is actually a blantant copy of the ending to Star Trek II.<br /><br />Overall the individual actors play their parts well with Benedict Cumberbatch pretty much stealing every scene he's in.  This movie is forgettable, some will watch it for the CG then forget about it later, others will watch it for a specific actor (Cumberbatch or Pine) and that's about it.  It has no redeeming qualities as a Trek film, made by people who either (1) don't care about Trek lore or (2) aren't familiar with Trek lore.<br /><br />1.5/5  (the half point given for Benedict's outstanding performance)This movie is forgettable, some will watch it for the CG then forget about it later, others will watch it for a specific actor (Cumberbatch or Pine) and that's about it.

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I really liked the set up of the storyline about peculiar kids with weird powers. And I loved the fact that all the pictures in the book are real. The story started off with a very promising story. I felt the story faltered during the middle of the book because it started becoming a story for teenagers instead of a book for adults. I mean it was like reading the twilight  series instead of a book written by say Stephen king. . I lost interest and the shock value fizzled around the middle of the book. Not a bad read, just didn't hold my focus.

B00B1COIRW|4.0|\\"Populaire\\" is a French romantic comedy starring Romain Duris (\\"The Spanish Apartment\\") and Déborah François (\\"The Page Turner\\"). And believe me or not, this charming movie is not just about romance and coemdy; it is also about speed typing.<br /><br />Set in the late 1950s, \\"Populaire\\" follows a story of 21-year-old country girl Rose (Déborah François), who is hired as a secretary by an outspoken insurance agency owner Louis (Romain Duris). Rose, hardworking as she is, almost loses her job because of her complete incompetence, but her boss Louis, impressed with her great typing skills, proposes a deal. That is, Rose is allowed to stay if she enters a speed typing competition.<br /><br />The plot itself (slightly reminiscent of \\"My Fair Lady\\") is nothing new. The idea of watching women in old-fashioned 1950s costume feverishly hammering on a manual typewriter may hardly sound exciting, but because of the nice acting, clever camerawork and snappy editing, the competition sequences are surprisingly intense.<br /><br />The film is also notable for its colorful visuals inspired by the classic French and Hollywood movies. Déborah François's spirited heroine reminds us of Audrey Hepburn.<br /><br />Besides the two capable leads, the film has interesting supporting cast including Bérénice Bejo (Oscar nominated for her turn in \\"The Artist\\"), Shaun Benson and Miou-Miou. The film is directed by feature first-timer Régis Roinsard, who did a solid job. Photography is by Guillaume Schiffman (\\"The Artist\\").<br /><br />\\"Populaire\\" is a delightful and unpretentious romantic comedy with a bit of nostalgia. All those heavy and noisy manual typewriters, where did they go?
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|This game is boring and no fun at all. I can't find anything good to say about it. Sorry Folks
B00CX7OW1G|3.0|Here is another Terrence Malick film, following \\"The Tree of Life\\" only made one year before. Reportedly, \\"To the Wonder\\" is, like his previous effort, a semi-autobiographical movie of the director fiercely protective of his private life. Here Ben Affleck plays Neil, an American travelling in Europe, who falls in love with a recently divorced Ukrainian mother of one daughter Marina played by Olga Kurylenko. Meanwhile, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), respected priest losing his faith.<br /><br />Though \\"To the Wonder\\" benefits from the poetic beauty of the images thanks to photographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who worked for the director's \\"The New World\\" and \\"The Tree of Life\\"), the film itself remains an impressionistic collection of images. We are supposed to look behind these images and find something, while honestly I am not sure it's worth trying.<br /><br />I know Terrence Malick's unique filmmaking style, and I love his earlier work \\"Days of Heaven,\\" which offers a simple but intriguing story. In this newest film, what the director does with fragmentary images may be unconventional, but what happens in the film, if derived of its showy styles, is pretty conventional, even banal, together with the dull voiceovers. To me, \\"To the Wonder\\" is frustratingly pretentious and self-indulgent.<br /><br />I think I know \\"To the Wonder\\" is trying to do. It's about the feeling and emotion envisioned by the director. But people just don't cry or laugh. There is a context in which those emotions are expressed, and usually dialogue, story or character development provides that context, which the film refuses to do. This may have worked with other material, but if it's a love story, which is a very personal thing, well, I don't think so.
1620404869|5.0|So if you have any familiarity with Jane Austen, you're going to figure out the plot of this one quickly, and you will enjoy every second of it. The allusions to the novel itself as well as the Colin Firth BBC version had me in stitches. The main character is hilarious as are the supporting characters, especially Miss Charming. I'm so glad Jennifer Coolidge is playing her in the movie, because she is the only woman I could imagine in that role anyway. The overt and subtle references to P&P are so well done and so wonderfully interwoven into the story. As a former single 30 something, I could also relate to the main character that way as well. If you like Jane Austen, if you like a good laugh, if you like irony, a few plot twist curve balls, and a sweet romance, this is definitely your book.

B0073HNL3Q|3.0|I have to admit I gave up on this book. I think it would actually have worked better if it had been a simple tale of a dead girl helping her father find her killer from beyond the grave. But it isn't - it's full of metaphysical rubbish, much of which seems to me quite infantile in concept and maudlin in execution. I feel really bad for saying this, because the author of the book suffered appalling trauma in her life, and this work was a kind of catharsis for her. There is the nugget of a better book in there, and the editors could have done a tighter job on it by demanding a better narrative structure and more tightly controlled prose.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nice.  I like it!  It is a nice game.  I hope everybody would play with it.  Thanks you very much!!

B009LDD54K|3.0|I looked forward to watching this so much that I blew through the entire season within a few days, only to find myself seriously disappointed with the quality of script-writing by the end: there were more than a few earmarks of work by some hacks who pen those masterpieces of turn-your-brain-off pablum - \\"action/adventure\\" films - washing over the season like waves from the Atlantic.<br /><br />WARNING! \\"SPOILERS\\" OCCUR FROM HERE ON...<br /><br />While there were a \\"boatload\\" (seems appropriate) of plot problems this season - these I found the most ludicrous:<br /><br />- while I understand the writers wanting Margaret to see Slater's corpse for dramatic reasons, does it make any sense that, with the heightened security and  paranoia following the bombing, a crate would be BROUGHT INTO NUCKY'S PENTHOUSE AND OPENED - as if there couldn't possibly be anything dangerous in it?<br /><br />- the scene where Harrow rescues Tommy from the brothel was preposterous in the sense that he could enter a roomful of armed (Rosetti's crew had just been abandoned by Masseria's in the middle of a \\"war\\" - think they'd be standing around without guns?) men all around him and take them out before they got him - that would be ridiculous even for a man with both eyes! It was also pretty convenient that the guy holding Tommy hostage wasn't literally doing so, offering Harrow a clear shot.<br /><br />- forget the logistical issue of Tonino managing to contact and meet up with Gyp and some of the remaining crew in the middle of nowhere; he's able to give a (viscerally-pleasing painful/slow, at least) dispatch to him - with no resistance from the others.  Afterwards, we find that Nucky and Eli have followed ALONE (that's very trusting - or foolish) to a nearby spot, and are willing to accept Tonino's word that a man trying to kill them is dead - without any proof being offered.<br /><br />- then there's Van Alden, whose co-workers must have decided to write off his blow-up to office \\"horseplay\\", as there's apparently no need for him and his family to relocate - even within Chicago.  The murdered agent's complaint about his aside, that's quite a high-quality iron - stays hot and steam-filled for a very, very long time...<br /><br />I could go on and on, but I don't want to waste any more of my time on Season 3 - it did a fair job of that already.

B000002GXS|5.0|This is one of his best albums ever. I already knew what I was getting at the time I purchased this. All of my records were stolen, thats why I am trying to replace them one by one, my favorites first of course. It will take a while.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am an avid reader that has never really been into fantasy novels, but this is the best book I have ever read in my life!
B00E3Q587M|5.0|My relationship with Chick goes wayyy back. He's the master.. I loved him when RTF got back together and went on tour. I had to go see him in San Francisco . As always, he hit this out of the park.. as usual... Gotta get it..
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This game is very fun and keep your thinking going. Just make sure you keep track with the clock and don't let it run out.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|I thought the author spent too much time on irrelevant details...to an extreme. Good solid stories and an enjoyable read. I found myself thinking of the characters often when I wasn't reading. Always a sign that the story has really drawn you in.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Never has a television show followed a book series so closely.  While some of the locations and small details may be altered for production purposes, nearly all of the dialog is taken verbatim and everything integral to the story remains intact on the show.  Although the books are many times more expansive than the show could hope to be obviously.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords is all about being on the move.  It seems everyone is on their way to or from somewhere, and those who aren't wish they were.  These are uncertain times for all of the characters and no one is safe.  If I had to sum up this book in a single word, that word would be: Hodor.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a great quick read from Neil Gaiman. It's a lot like an extremely creative bed time story for adults. I found it so engaging, I finished it in one sitting.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Love this sitcom! Can't get enough. It is witty, compelling, cute, and I can relate to it very much.  Keep it up writers!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is really fun and addictive. Sometimes I can play it up to two hours but, one thing that is annoying is that there is a lot of adds. I do recamend this game.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Excellent movie.  A must have movie if a fan of Richard Gere and/or Julia Roberts. A excellent story how two different individuals find love..
B007JRUCGO|5.0|This is an adorable movie.  My 4 year old granddaughter loves it as do I her grandmaother.  It is adorable and very cute for children.  I would highly reccomend it to kids of all ages.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|Great love story. Great acting from Richard Gere and Jodie Foster. Must see movie if one likes a love story and the hardships one had to endure after the Civil War.
B009EE13R2|5.0|Barbara Streisand's best! Great music and story. Walter Mathau good as a grumpy young man before later becoming a grumpy old man. Good clean fun!
B0099HUB8Q|5.0|Great to relive the images and settings Herriot portrays so well.<br />I will buy the rest of the series when they're better priced.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Wish I had purchased the 3g option, otherwise this is an excellent product, especially for reading and on line research.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I started watching the series about 2 weeks ago, just about finished with season 4!  Fantastic show!  Lots of violence and sex, but not over the top.  Being able to watch episode after episode without commercials is AWESOME with Prime!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I actually had this figured out before it was disclosed, but I did enjoy the story.  It was well-written, good character development, excellent description of depth of feelings.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Different than the movie, but very interesting in its own way. Worth the read, slow, but stick with it. No Brad, though.
B009WUBERW|5.0|This is a no nonsense shoot 'em up action flick. Sure the plot is so so, but it's got all your favorite action stars delivering lots of CGI blood and silly one liners.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is by far, in my humble opinion, the best show on television. I watched one episode and I am hooked. Great writing.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Great season finale. As usual, it comes with suspense but this why I love this show!! I look forward to season finales...
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I love DiCaprio but this movie is strange. The story is of a neighbor who live next to him. I think this movie was made so people can have big parties and write it off as a hollywood movie. Terrible
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Great value case, much better than other cases in the $50 range.  Solid build, room for plenty of upgrades, slick look (big fan of the all black interior), bottom mount PSU, easy accessibility.  I've tried other cases, but I always come back to Antec.
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you're looking for a cheesy 80s style action flick, then this will scratch that itch! It's an overdose of action stars with plenty of ridiculous action scenes!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|i love how all 8 movies are together in a nice small case. the only thing that would have been better is if the movies including the extra scenes in the movie!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|There were a lot of curse words casually thrown in, not that you'd expect a great deal of passion from zombies, but there you go.  The player lagged a little bit unless I buffered it for something like ten minutes.  Video quality was fine, and the story was very entertaining.
0345803485|5.0|I really loved this book. Good storyline and I loved characters.  This was a bookclub selection and we had fun discussing the story.  Although, the ladies were reluctant to discuss the sex, we rated this book as very good and we would recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of those games that you can put down and have to come and pick it back cause it's just to darn good
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I honestly don't like it. It is just not even the real candy crush game. It's the help guide and what good does that do.
B006M4F67A|5.0|easy going game, very relaxing for game to play when traveling and down time, play this game alot all mahjong are fun
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm a weather junkie. ;-)  I love good weather apps. AccuWeather has outdone themselves with this app! Put in all my cities, and everything loaded up perfectly. Great details, and the graphs are awesome. Just wish the app on my Blackberry phone worked as well as this app works on my Kindle Fire. Well done, AccuWeather!!!
B009AY04A8|5.0|Kept me quiet for a while but a bit too much dialouge<br /><br />I tried to skip this but it wouldn't let me<br />Other than that it was a good way to kill some time
B005XUC398|1.0|This is at best a low end version of a Wall Street type of movie that I could not watch again.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Cool game!  Keeps me playing for hours.  Love puzzle games.  I would definitely pay to get the collector's edition of these games.
B003DWG29A|1.0|This movie was frustrating to follow and watch.  Main character is so bizarre and the supporting cast equally misplaced. Could not say it was even watchable.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I could watch it over and over, and do.  It is extremely interesting and provides deep insight into the Eagles from start to current.  If you are an Eagles fan, you will love it.
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|Felt like I was watching a remake of the matrix that some college kids made at their home or backyard
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Great app. Love it. Everything the app should do it pretty much does.  I love gmail. And it was free.
B00EDF43MY|3.0|Anyone else notice that the middle eastern raccoon was the ONLY character to get stopped by airport security?  Just saying. What's up with that?! BTW, I wish I was joking.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|First off, let me just say that this book is the best book you'll ever read. That's plain, simple fact. The characters are brilliant, the plot is superb and it will take you on an emotional rollercoaster like you've never been on.<br />You'll laugh, you'll sigh, you might possibly flail and you'll (almost) definitely cry. So hop on, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, and read The Fault in Our Stars!<br /><br />(Side note: I didn't cry. I am starting to worry that I may be some sort of robot or otherwise emotionless creature, because that's the only way I couldn't have cried...)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to read and works great!  Just wanted basic math and something easy to read. and this fits the bill.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|I havent seen Stargate in awhile; Im glad its part of the selection, and in HD! Thanks again Amazon Prime!
0321934318|4.0|Good book to have in your library.  If you follow the methods laid out lightroom will treat the way you will want it too...
B005544V6A|4.0|This is a great mindless TV series. The characters are all handsome and articulate and the dialog reminds me of Aaron Sorkin. The good guys win, but only after some close calls. Wonderful distraction from the real world.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|If I had never seen any other movie I would probably have been blown away.  However, I have, which makes this seem unoriginal.  I felt like I have seen this type of story before, told more skillfully.  It used all the old plays from the Tom Cruise move playbook.
B005MLP8E0|5.0|It's a classic.  After many years, it has only gotten better.  I must be an experience for all cinema fans.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is fun and fast paced. If you love the original card game you will Love this...it's much better!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I think it is cool, just want sunset information.  All of the details are vood, like the extended forecast.  Thanks a bunch.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great youth crossover book that should appeal to adults and kids alike. Beautifully written. This would be an excellent addition to a late elementary/middle school reading list.
B00E3I3KDE|3.0|My star rating is based entirely on the new songs. If you don't already have Halcyon, bump it up to an additional star, as the main album is outstanding.<br /><br />Ellie Goulding has done this twice now. First came Lights, then came Bright Lights, the same album with a number of bonus tracks. Okay, she was still establishing herself at that point, and that was a way to get some more product out there to support her popularity as it took a while for the \\"Lights\\" single to catch on. Her proper follow-up, Halcyon, was great. Now comes the same album with an entire album's worth of new songs tacked on. Of course, to get it, you have to repurchase Halcyon. (By the way, \\"Lights\\" is a bonus track on that album. So, if you bought all of Goulding's releases up to this point, you've bought this song four times! As great as that song is, that's just not fair to the buyer.)<br /><br />The solution would seem to be to download the individual tracks, if you already have Halcyon. The pricing doesn't work out in the customer's favor yet again, though.<br /><br />I don't usually comment on price, but this is just too lousy a trend not to write about. Please, Ellie, release new music on its own. This rapid-fire rereleasing of albums is just a poorly conceived method of selling music, disrespecting fans who buy your music on faith the day it's originally put on the market.<br /><br />The new songs themselves, by the way, range from good to very good. Nothing's bad, but only \\"Burn\\" stands out so far as being excellent.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Gritty Classic!  Lost the last one!  I know I can order but this is one of the top dozen that MUST be owned!<br /><br />Hot chick!  Guy Flick!<br /><br />Tarantino!
0802473156|5.0|Great book, geared towards married couples though. I am not married, but I bought this book to help me understand my girlfriend a little better--on a deeper level. It has completely changed my way of thinking and I'm thrilled! It has helped me allow our relationship to get to the next level, I've never been happier.
1439152810|3.0|Had trouble staying with this book as much too slow moving until the last 1/3 or so. Then it picked up and was a great read.  Where are the editors to take out the excess and keep a story moving???
0345349571|5.0|I do not read many books but this one is glorious. It will transport you to the medieval 14th century with all sorts of oddities such as the Avignon popes and stupid monarchs. Tuchman at her best!
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|AAWWHH MAN, you are in for a def fun night, my only problem is you only get it for 24 hours. you cant see it enuff for 24 hours its that good, the deception from your best friend, bringing you down from the inside, to the point of getting you killed. normaly this is the way it goes, unless you are that good and lucky enuff to survive, and bounce back even stronger, but then you became the one every one stares at, (in real life.)enjoy.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun fun fun, use your creativity to create a reef. Lean about the ocean and a reef while expressing your creativity. Free!  5 stars....
B00DW39B2K|3.0|the movie was ok, both running around trying to kill each other, only to hurt each other, some gory scenes, it would have been better w/ 2 believable actors, imager a 70 something yr old doing what he does, i dont think so. but if you watch it thru no filters, it is entertaining.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This movie should have all remained on the cutting room floor.  Below 1 star.  Don't waste your time.  It's gargbage.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|DONT BUY THIS CRAP it is just iratating garbage writen buy a iliterate tenage slobe who wanted to get her money off her harry potter fan fiction changed some names and now she is loaded dont give her more money for this peice of plotless waste of space on your kindel
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|The last chapter gives you a summary of what to do if you want to modify your style.  Given that we have to work with different types of people it si good to know the differences and understand how to deal with them
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it! Such an amazing book!! The author is so amazing! I can't wait for the next one!! So excited!
B00192IOBA|5.0|Not only do I love this album but so does my family. The minure it comes on my son makes me re play it
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Of the three Nolan Batman movies, this is my sentimental favorite.  However, I was not able to make full use of the digital copy.  I wasn't able to down load it.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|I loved this album because it has all my favorite songs on it. I have been a Jovi fan for a very long time
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|A Must Have!!<br />Great show!!<br />Blackmore is on FIRE!!<br />I saw this tour at the Jaxx in Virginia in 1997.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I am a new fan of Mr. Mraz. His music is so soothing. I just truly enjoy sitting back and listening too him
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This was the message I desperately needed. Stop trying to be perfect and create when the world is choking on creation and information. Take a couple of successful concepts that you are passionate about combine them and find a market that needs it. Speak their language and curate the information overload and become the trusted provider of wisdom that makes their lives better for a fee. Rinse and repeat till you have a tribe then sell the company and do it again. I have set a goal of eliminating possessions and becoming a full time world traveler, running my company like James does! Thank You James!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Great movie<br />It made me cry<br />It was funny<br />It felt so real I mean those thing happen every d
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Very catchy with lots of talent - nice to come across truly talented artists these days. Several songs on the album just have away of sticking with you - in a good way!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very entertaining.  Almost ADDICTIVE!!  Entire family ( ages 6-63) plays constantly.  My grandson would rather play FREE FLOW than watch TV...
B007LB5MF4|5.0|love the show. now love the graphic novel as well.....there are differences between this and the show in terms of the story, subtle but interesting....a great read for fans of the show :)
B00A285OOW|5.0|Captivating! Always read her books, I love the drama and page-turning suspense. Hope she has another book in the works
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It feels a bit like Stardust, but more serious in tone. A very good read and an interesting view of magic.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I like how easy is too use, it will let you know to clean to boost your memory or performance on your kindle. My only complain like another costumer pointed out it won't clean your browser, you have to manually clean that yourself only reason that it did not got the 5 stars from me.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|All of the included free games are fun yet challenging.  This is a great game!!  I would definitely recommend it for download for anyone who enjoys pinball.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Even for an action movie, the plot was thin. And especially for an action movie the action was poor. For the first half of the movie, not a single government guy was killed, but a thousand rebels were. For the second half, not a single rebel was killed but government guys all died. The special effects were not detailed enough and looked video-gamey. All the government guys wore motorcycle helmets for some stupid reason. And the plot itself was all about people being anti-emotion, but then even the characters who were supposed to be upholding that position demonstrated endless emotion. It was just thin and poor in almost every way.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The Judges go into this building complex to bust a drug operation making a drug that makes the user feel like time slows considerably. See, my brain is so fried, I am writing run-on sentences. I feel like I've been hammered with a cement block for 2 hrs. If you can sustain this brutal torture, the last scene is great. This movie isn't worth the headache.
B007AL48UK|3.0|I like Mahjong games...........these are kind of relaxing.  This one is okay; but doesn't seem to be as challenging as others I have.  Sort of boring!!!!
0783225725|5.0|My husband and I are both Clint Eastwood fans and we love ALL of his westerns.  Am looking forward to purchasing them all in the future.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Naturally, I am a &#34;Angry Birds&#34; fan.  I have all the older games on by Nook; but since getting my Kindle HD Fire, have been adding some of the newer games.  Although I wasn't paying attention & ordered this version instead of the HD version, still a very enjoyable game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have not watched this yet but was pleased to be able to get it. Anxious to watch. Thank You!!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|The author really captures the cultural difference between Aricans living in America and American born African Americans.<br />Her insights were worthy of a collection of their own. The characters were highly educated andworldly. The locales, the plot and the characters were well drawn and interesting. I didn't like the ending, but up until then I found it very engrossing and insightful.
0156027321|3.0|There's a lushness to the writing (and thought) in the opening chapters that initially drew me to this story.  I felt like I didn't much care where Martel was ultimately going to take me;  it would be fun going pretty much anywhere he felt like meandering.<br /><br />Then Martel abruptly changed not only his direction, but also his style.  Most of the rest of the book was bleak and harsh.<br /><br />The ending didn't offer any relief.  I found it both obscure and pretentious.  At first I didn't know whether Martel was pulling my leg with his &#34;discussion questions,&#34; but in the end I just didn't care--they failed regardless of whether they were meant to be spoofing or serious.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This is the perfect addition to our stroller. It easily holds my water, my daughter's sippy cup, my phone, wallet, keys and a few other things. It's easy to put on and very durable!
