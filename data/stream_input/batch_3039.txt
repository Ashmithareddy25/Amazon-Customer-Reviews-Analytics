B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Marvel has so much material from all there years of comic books. It's great to see these shows on TV. The series is pretty good so far!
B007EC27QM|1.0|Use less app. The stock Samsung calculator has more options.<br />It was billed as a calculator with lots of options, but only had 4 additional features. Very disappointed.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Very well put together and easy to use  I like the super bright graphics. All in all very pleasant viewing!!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I love this new , New music cd from Paul Mccartney, I have to say that i was not expecting such a great cd, but what can i say? I am very pleased with this cd and most of the songs are great, and a few of them i am sure will grow on me as i listen to them a few more times. You should buy this cd cause you will find that Paul has really put together a great work of music here and who knows how many more he will put out???? He worked so hard on this cd and also worked so hard on getting the word out that he was putting out a new album. He was here there and everywhere, I really do not know how he gets so much motivation to do this at 71. I am very impressed by his love of his craft and now we all know that with his energy and drive and love of his music that if John were still here that they would have done something together, but let me tell you Paul is doing ok on his own and he has not run out of good ones yet, as George harrison once said as a joke. George and john would have liked this , at least most of it. Thanks Paul for another great album to add to my stack of many already that i have of yours. You should buy this cd ,you will not be sorry you did, great music from a great one.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Great period piece!  The Downton Abbey of the 1970's.  Addictive show, great characters and story lines.  A must watch show!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the Shining and couldn't imagine what lay ahead for Danny. WOW! Another Stephen King masterpiece, I couldn't put it down....
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book on the recommendation of someone, and was pleasantly surprised. The book was engaging, and held my interest. I like this genre. I'm excited to see how the movie plays out...
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|I bought this TWICE and hae been cheated as it is nowhere on my phone to download it. First time, I thought it was my own mistake, so I bought it a second time, and STILL nothing comes up on my phone to say download.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Brandon Sanderson continues to grow and improve as an author but I think this is written for a younger audience that limits him a little.  Story-wise it is good, though not up to the craftsmanship he demonstrated in the final three volumes of Robert Jordan's &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; series.  At least Sanderson has proven several times that he can grab a theme and complete the story without beating it completely to death, so his teenage audience has a fighting chance of finishing the series before they get out of college!
B005LJKEXS|5.0|This is a high quality cable at a reasonable price. The cable is very strong and works perfectly for me.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Hours of entertainment. Sometimes everything falls into line.. other times you have to work for it. Work to beat the clock!
1401938906|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it actually gives you techniques to use your own energy and work the law of attraction. Finally some tools to ground us enough to stop waiting for our desires and actually start believing we are worthyof receiving and manifesting them with our own power. It will remind you that you are much more powerful then you ever imagined. Stop waiting and start manifesting! YEAH!
B000H4TX9I|4.0|I had seen the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; and did not even know there was a TV series to go along with it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you want to lose sleep start playing!  Great Game that keeps me entertained until i have to wait for my turns to refresh.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie was a fun watch.  It's not as complex as the Marvel or D.C. movies and certainly not as pretentious.
B000I186FW|5.0|This movie was very moving. Hard to say what people will judge &#34;V&#34; as, was he a terrorist, a political activist, a genius, a poet, an artist, a founder or justification, of will he be forever vilified as a fictional example of what coiuld have been? This movie was emotional and sent me through some loops of emotion and I had a blast watching it, and a blast evaluating his words and actions.
140053271X|2.0|I guess i got what i paid for, considering i paid less than 30 for it. works sparingly. should have waited and spent my hard earned money else where.

1250038820|5.0|I am so proud to display this gorgeous book on my coffee table!  Brandon's photos are luminous and captivating - and the vignettes that accompany the photos are in turn humorous and heartbreaking.  Kudos to Macmillan for publishing a high-quality, stunning hardcover book.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Second instalment and Patrick Rothfuss doesn't disappoint and again while reading this book I had to live on very little sleep. This book is longer than the first but every bit as enjoyable. A must read for fantasy lovers, looking forward to the next instalment.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!  I get lost in time playing this game.  My housework is slacking, but at least I'm relaxed! Recommend this to anyone!
B00BA5H3TU|5.0|This was my first album by these guys, and I will be buying the back catalog.  Pretty much the perfect blend of old and new, heavy and melodic prog elements.  Highly recommended for fans of Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, and the like
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is such an awesome show.  We find our selves just waiting impatiently for the next season to come out.  Glad to find this set at a reasonable price and shipped so quickly.  Thanks again.  Loving season 6.

B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Awesome movie for the whole family!!<br />Great quality picture, as if I had a bluray disc playing.<br />2 thumbs up
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book. ..I couldn't put it down!  Highly recommend.  The best sequel to the Shining that Stephen King could have imagined.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Entertaining - I liked that Pepper played a bigger roll and, as always, Tony was his normal narcissitic, self-absorb, but giving self.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read, has all of King's classic style, a True page turner from Colorado to New England, shine on Stephen King
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|The game itself is really, really fun. But a lot of people using the kindle fire seem to get to a point where it just crashes and won't let you get any further.<br /><br />I'm at that point, and I'm quite sad about it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have been a believer of spirituality and life after death for decades.  That said, it has been frustrating that science has not acknowledged that there is reason to validate it.  This neurosurgeon makes great strides in making the correlation between the two.  Thank you!!
B000FC146C|5.0|Read this 35 years ago. Never got over it. A work of art. You know it's good fiction when you can't believe it's fiction.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Just enough challenge to keep you playing, but not frustrated. There are over 200 levels, keeping you busy for a long time. This is one of the best puzzle games from King.
B005MHHREI|5.0|It is clear that Jung Chang has no love for Mao and is heavily into the myth debunking business. However, there are few figures in the 20th Century so desperately in need of debunking. Mao's legacy seems to have got off almost scott free compared to his fellow dictators such as Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot.<br /><br />Jun Chang paints the picture of a cunning, totally ruthless, self pitying, lecherous, cowardly, vicious, and largely incompetent psychopath who by means of being more ruthless and willing to backstab and murder than his peers managed to wrestle control of the CPC. But her story is backed up by extensive research and personal interviews. The background notes and references are almost as long as the main text.<br /><br />The result is a very readable biography, even if a little one dimensional. The only positive attributes she is prepared to assign to Mao are his calligraphy and some of his poetry.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you watch Netfix or those other pay extra services and you need a WiFi path over to your TV this isn't bad. Displaying your personal files pictures, videos etc. you'll have to jump through hoops to get it done. Wait till they work that out.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I began reading Allegiant with a real sense of nervous anticipation.  Even though I had been a big fan of the first two novels in the series, it had been a good while since I had read them.  I didn't have the patience to go back and re-read, so off we went.  It didn't take long for me to get drawn back into the world of Tobias and Tris, factions, and terrible choices.  I had a hard time keeping track of some of the supporting characters, and this was the only thing that made me wish I had taken the time to re-read the first two books.<br /><br />I have no urge to ruin the plot by describing it here.  Many fans have been waiting on pins and needles to see what happens and they won't be disappointed.  There are surprises, twists and turns, and then even more twists and turns.  I was dazzled by the author's plotting skill as she laid out a careful web of deceits and half-truths that are sure to keep readers turning the pages, much as I did, looking for the truths that always seemed to lurking just beneath the surface of what our heroes were being told.<br /><br />This story is told in alternating chapters by both Tris and Tobias.  I will admit that I was not a fan of this method.  The author did not do a very good job of giving them distinctive voices, often leaving me confused as to who was speaking.  I believe this robbed the narrative of some of its energy, leading to a pace that was slow, and an overall tone that was far less suspenseful and dramatic than it should have been.<br /><br />While I admired the author's plotting skill as she introduced so many new elements, I did end up feeling that some were contrived.  She slipped into quite a bit of telling instead of showing, and if I hadn't been so interested in where she was going, I might have ended up feeling frustrated pretty early on.  As it was, I was captivated by the story and the society, and intrigued by the many ethical questions offered up in the book.  The author has a firm grip on the dystopian world she has created and uses it to widely explore questions of equality and free will.<br /><br />I was all set to assign a three star rating to Allegiant until I came to the last eighty pages or so.  The drama and emotion that was somewhat lacking in the book, came at me full force in an ending that was brave and exciting and totally unexpected.  Fans of the series should be well satisfied by this ending.  It's not perfect, however it's a very worthy end for a story that has garnered millions of fans and made us all think about the power of love and a single choice.she has created and uses it to widely explore questions of equality and free will.<br /><br />I was all set to assign a three star rating to Allegiant until I came to the last eighty pages or so.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a fan of Stephen King's books all the way back to the original publication of Salem's Lot - the first of his books that I read; my own personal favorite is The Stand, but I loved Carrie, The Shining, Dead Zone, It and some other classic King stories.  I was ok with some of his later works; I did enjoy Duma Key, and 11/22/63; I never really &#34;got&#34; The Dark Tower&#34; books.  I wasn't crazy about Rose Madder, Bag of Bones, and some of his other works.  So that's my background for my opinion of this book - which is that Doctor Sleep really is a great read!  The story flows well, the characters are interesting and well developed; and I cared about them.  There was none of the excess of exposition that I found in some of King's novels.  I like the idea of KIng revisiting his character from The Shining... I can hope he would do same with those in The Stand.  You don't need me to recap the story - just go read it yourself!!
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|Doesn't make a great impression in Android 4.3 on Nexus 4.<br /><br />Fortunately picked it up on Free App day and I can check later if the Dev sorts it out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What I love about this book is its ability to make you laugh, to make you cry, and to make you think. From the beginner I fell in love with the characters and I related to all the questions the had about life as well as death. I laughed, and I definitely cried through several parts of the book. It's an awesome read for anyone. And I enjoyed every emotion this book made me feel.
B007EC27QM|2.0|This app is so bloated that it even lags in responding to your key taps.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it gets the most basic algebra wrong.<br /><br />Can't recommend for students or adults.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|An interesting, humorous and exiting read. Couldn't put it down. Only negative no adult action I have to admit I like a little naughty in me reading.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A great movie I've watched many times thru the years but decided it was time to have it in my home so we could watch it whenever we want.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This is a great game! You play through as kind of a Robin hood figure steeling for the poor,  it has the cutest story and graphics, it is challenging but fun!! some of the levels I have had to have my husband or son help me because there are hidden treasures though out the level and they are not always obvious.  By it is worth it!!!
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Another movie I've watched many times thru the years and decided we need to have it to watch whenever we want so I bought it.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|We have seen this movie multiple times and steel laugh! worth it if you like Jim Carry!  I love the Dog in it, he is the star to me<br />!
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|This movie keeps you engaged in the plot and does a great job in providing amazing visual affects and action.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hooray! So glad to see that Candy Crush is finally available on my Kindle! Very addictive game! Don't start playing unless you want to get addicted too!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I finally got around to reading this book, had to after hearing/reading all the hype about it. I loved it! So glad I finally read it, and wish I hadn't put it off for so long. Very sweet yet tragic story. Broke my heart, made me cry, I laughed, I butterflying loved it!
B00E6887H0|4.0|Live in San Francisco does remember me to the first time a saw Ry Cooder in Amsterdam Carré, back in 1982......<br />Just the same enthousiastic atmosfere, great performens, and the same fantastic songs.<br />Everyone a litlle older, still good quality.<br />I,m still a big Ry Cooderfan.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Landay scores with a richly detailed mystery-drama of life as a parent in troubled times and circumstances. Using sharply nuanced voices, he portrays &#34;successful&#34; middle-class American lives gone horribly wrong. Is there a killer in the midst? How could there be? Read this fascinating story of all that's right and wrong in events so hopeful and yet so chillingly desperate.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book.  Getting closure on a past character was great, but this story could easily stand on its own.  Very well written and I thought the ending was a bit different for Stephen King.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|The movie had nothing worth watching. Acting was terrible. I would not recommend waisting an hour and a half of your time to watch.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I missed a lot of the first season because I moved and gave up my DVR. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to catch any of the second season either. Thanks for making it possible to get caught up with the first season before I watch any of the second. Great series!
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|It wad good. I love Will Smith and his son couldn't be cuter! It was interesting.  I love a good futuristic movie!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|One of the better Disney princess movies made- definitely recommend for anyone. Funny and heartfelt without any \\"damsel in distress\\" moments.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|This is my absolute favorite series of all time. If you think your Job sucks and you have a hard day at work and with family imagine that your family is your business and you own and run a funeral home. Imagine you may have to bury your own family members or you lose friends and loved ones and your family is riding you back that its still a business yet while personal secrets are showing up during the funeral with the ridiculous requests that are made. Now throw in all the other troubles with life and your personal life this makes for the best entertaining series that HBO has ever done in my opinion. This is season two of five.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing for a while & finally got it connected to my kindle.  It is addictive & Fun to play
B00A757EFW|1.0|They took away the leaderboard feature!  That was what made it awesome.  And, the app is still called &quot;lite&quot; after you purchase it...
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like the interaction with my friends & to play games against my face book friends.  Also keeping up with people I don't see often
B006P0FD4W|5.0|This was a good prequel, wish they would've answered more of my questions about this specific story, but I would highly suggest watching this one if you're into the whole series.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down.  It is set in Australia but that is not important to the story.  The husband's secret affects the lives of all of the characters.
B008H6GHL0|3.0|Not my best purchase. I loved Resident Evil Degeneration, but this one was kind of a let down for me, I expected more from the trailer I guess, but it's Resident Evil and it's one of my favorite series, so it's alright.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|loved this series! I am a history junky..and even though the show may not be completely accurate it was very entertaining.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I loved this movie, looks great on the blu-ray disc and looking forward to future purchases of the Hobbit movies!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This has saved me greatly in charge time. Any NEWER Android phone can use the Apple port for charging at an extremely fast rate.<br /><br />It's compact and just nicely designed.<br /><br />I'm an Anker fan because everything I've bought from replacement batteries to wall adapters over many years just embarrass the competition.<br /><br />They are quality and great price.  Customer is amazing add well.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I love this next installment of the beginning of the Enterprise Crew.  This one showed more of the personal side of Spock and Kirk.  I cry everytime I watch it and I've watched it quite a lot.  Would I recommend this? Absolutely.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a big page turner for me. All of Collins books are like that. Now to read the next.<br /><br />*sigh*
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just beat level 440 and I'm stopped because it don't go any higher need to add more levels please for my kindle and iphone. love the game
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I ordered this for my son who was anxious to read this account. He was not disappointed and neither was I because he stuck his face in there and did not come out until he finished it. He loved it and after a time could in and hour give a detailed report on its contents so the writing and story were compelling.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Too costly not enough winning points.  Lots of other things I enjoy more.  I might like it more if I played more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally for kindle!  Love this game!!<br />This game is really addicting u should try.<br />I was waiting for that for such a long time
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|In the 1.1 update that doubled the levels, level 12 has a glitch in which picking up the dagger from the armor on the left keeps you stuck on that screen, making progress impossible.<br />.<br />Other than that, I'd give it a solid recommendation  for the cheap price.  It's pretty much what you would expect from an escape game, and there aren't any puzzles that felt very cheap either.<br />Odds are that if you're reading this, than you should probably get it.
B0071MV540|4.0|Great comedy.  Unexpected story, was expecting a different theme, but was great either way.  Great for a night in<br />Thanks
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I got the Kindle version of all 5 books and it fills in the gabs that HBO couldn't fit in the show.
B000LX00RY|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie, well one of them.  I have watched this several times.  Great story, great costumes, great actors.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I Love it.It has some awesome stuff on there site..I know a lot of people who Love this site keep up the good work
B002XBVQKW|4.0|So many comedians in this movie!  It was really great to revisit this movie.  I love Steve Martin's part as the dentist and Bill Murray as the the patient.  I don't know how the two of them got thru the scenes together.  They were so funny.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|it's a great movie with lots of suspense,action and thriller it's funny and leaves you wondering what's gonna happen next.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|THIS ADOBE READER WAS NO GOOD. YOU CAN OPEN PDF FILE, BUT CAN WORK WITH IT. CAN'T HIGHLIGHT ANYTHING, CAN'T TYPE IN THE PDF FILE.  AND YOU NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET FOR IT TO WORK. I HAD TO REMOVE IT AND GET IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.
B0035LMTZA|3.0|A few complaints here and there narrative wise, and it's all a little to smug.  You never really have the sense that these guys are ever in danger of failing.  While it makes them a bit un-relatable, it's also part of the movie's charm.  Other than that it's a solid heist film with some great action sequences and decently clever dialogue.<br /><br />Good performances all around (except for Wahlberg's face during highly emotional scenes), and a fun storyline.  Great popcorn movie for when you just want to turn off your brain and recharge.  :)
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Yes! Great movie! Kept you guessing the whole time and great cast. Definitely would see it again for sure! Love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|In Downton Abbey, I get to watch some history, drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one show.  Given all the inane stuff on TV these days,, this show beautifully weaves story lines and characters with whom I'd like to share a &#34;spot of tea&#34;.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The chromecast does very well what it promises, to cast the chrome browser and to watch netflix and youtube. But I´m still waiting for new apps to come to improve the experience.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm not going to rehash the story.  I'm sure a hundred other someones will do that for you.  I will say, if you haven't read The Shining, read it first.<br /><br />There were times I had to put the book (kindle) down and settle myself before continuing.  This is classic King and I loved and word of it.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|Not true to the book but still entertaining to watch.  the cast was excellent and I would definitely watch this again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A &#34;perfect&#34; family in a &#34;perfect&#34; town...until the secret is out! Then we see the truth in the lives of suddenly &#34;real&#34; people. Lots of interesting characters in this one.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I had heard so much about this book series that I just had to read it.  Some things are a little far fetched  I can't wait to read the 3rd book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I do most of my ebay shopping on my Kindle fire. It's so easy to use and can keep you update on bids. Sp recommend this app!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  There was a lot of talking about his life.  (TOO MUCH)<br />Not at all what I thought it would be like.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Very well written and engaging, The Well of Ascension is a gripping tale, filled with magic and philosophy. Anyone who loves fantasy should experience that Mistborn series.
B007TVANDM|5.0|A wonderful lesson in being mellow in adversity.  It's a great way to live your life.<br />We love it because \\"it's all good.\\"
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|There was a lot that could have been done with the movie but instead they resorted to cheesy melodrama.<br /><br />It was reminiscent of Godzilla which was great but the idea that the good guys weapons only worked at close range was stupid.<br /><br />Also the killing of all the main characters was idiotic, the hero and his girlfriend used an escape pod to survive but everyone else went down with their ships. That sure depletes your troops.<br /><br />Why was the last alien warrior pregnant? The aliens built all of their warriors and certainly making one of them pregnant would hinder their performance. Must be stupid aliens.<br /><br />What is with portal? It was under water and when the hero was in the enemy world, all he did was set the bomb to go off and drift upward with only seconds to spare.  Hello, that was a thermal nuclear bomb, he couldn't get far enough away in an hour let alone seconds.<br /><br />Lots of promise but just like politicians, it didn't deliver much.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I've always enjoyed Whitney Houston's songs and wanted to find the  best CD collection I could find.  For me this was the one<br />I had been looking for. If you like Whitney's music you will love this CD.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|We watched all 5 seasons and enjoyed them all. Highly recommend this series - something for everyone. Love Walter! and the entire cast
B007Q35PLI|5.0|All people think differently. We all contribute to the world by the ways we see it. This movie is one of the most touchy and entertaining versions of that narrative. It's like Forrest Gump, only with cows.
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|Downloaded app to play with the kids. Screen was upside down. Rotated my kindle...still upside down.  Locked screen rotation...still upside down. The app won't orient rightside up. what a joke.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Amazing and enthralling read to learn the rest of Dan's life! Now the question for the author is where does Abra go? With her power still growing, how will she fit into the future stories?
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I am a huge fan of the divergent series i pre-orded this book Months ago. I will say that the ending was unexpected but i think veronica was getting sick of being compared to hunger games and other dystopian series out there and she made a choice and i can't name any other dystopian books that the main character ends up like tris . I actually cried which no book has ever done before. Intense i reccomend reading it , true its not the ending we want
1476727651|5.0|King lost his touch a long time ago.  Even he admits he's recycled his stories for a while now.  This new novel, however, proves he's still got game.  Excellent follow up to The Shining.
B00F35BV64|5.0|It was excellent to see the old cast members with new ones.  I also enjoyed all of the new technology!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was not disappointed. It was great to find out about Dan Torrence. The book held my attention all the way to the end
B00138F8UU|3.0|Classic system. Always good stuff when you are in the mood for some harder music.  Can never go wrong with system.
B00166996S|5.0|One of the best bands to watch and listen to live. The lead singer is genius as he writes, plays, and sings his heart out.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Awesome show . It was one of the best shows on cable tv. I will be watching all the seasons.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is similar to the original 'House of Cards' with Ian Richardson.  It was interesting to see how the action was changed from London to Washington.  Kevin Spacey was excellent.  I do recommend seeing the original then watching the U.S. version and comparing them.
B000HF0ISC|4.0|Great acting and a message that was well presented.  A good look at hell's kitchen and the environment surrounding it.
B00ESLTEOU|3.0|This lacks the artful construction and elegant prose found in other Austen works. Lots of characters spend a lot of time coming and going in one social setting after another, with little progress in the narrative. The ending has some good and predictable surprises, but getting to it is a bit of a slog. &#34;Persuasion&#34; develops a meaningful theme, however: the value of friendship, even if flawed.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|Canon is frustrating because control is not precise enough for consistent Canon kills. Needs larger kill zone on enemy aircraft or increase cannon cone of fire.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game with many vehicles to choose and courses to run them on. By collecting coins (points) each different vehicle can be modified to maximize it's performance. Additionally using the same &#34;points&#34; you can unlock various courses with vastly different terrain and environments. Operation is as simple as controlling your modified vehicle via brake (left) and gas (right) which can be real fun to do tricks and flips when catching major air. The game developer did a great job in having this be a game that you can really have fun with due to the varying degree of control based upon what your riding in (or on) and what course you happen to pick to run.  For me, definitely a 5 star game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are a Constant Reader then you deserve a trip back to Overlook hotel as we meet up with Dan and travel along his journey. Now this isn't The Shining part II so if that's what you're looking for you won't be happy. But if you want to read something that reminds you of the King's earlier works, this is a must.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you like this sort of book, it is well written. I have recommended it to many others.  This is stupid, having to write a certain amount of words.  Now, I don't like the book any longer.
B0091WR678|5.0|Great movie. It's a real head trip. Highly recommend watching really loud in surround sound. It's one of those movies you have to watch a few times.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved the telling of the story through shifting through items in an attic. The characters are well developed and real. A good look at how we don't know who people are by appearances alone.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is totally addicting and awesome I play it every chance I get I wish I could play it all day long
B00AA36RZY|4.0|Head First Design Patterns is a great book for understanding purpose of design patterns. I have only one problem with this book. It is images with a lot of texts...this is very uncomfortable in kindle.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of animation and sometimes viewers tire of overplayed themes, endless episodes of characters getting overpowered before a final showdown, or even avant garde studios jumping on the flavor of the year (NEETs anybody?).  Summer Wars is a one off movie that was nothing like anything I've watched.<br /><br />The best description is if Studio Ghibli took a chance at doing Dot.Hack in a tasteful way.  The animation quality is vivid and colorful in both traditional and CGI effects.  I very much enjoyed their interpretation of what the &#34;internet&#34; would look like instead of a dreary cyberpunk Matrix green and black (I love Ghost in the Shell).<br /><br />What the story does well is develop a genuine identity for the cast of characters in one big swing rather than draw out each and every personality.  Anyone who's ever sat down at large family gatherings such as Holidays, birthdays, weddings and such, will know exactly what I'm talking about.  At the swirling center are the characters who seem even more caught up in the events and only shine in their smallest of abilities but enough to impact the people around them.<br /><br />The DVD itself like many released these days is incredibly sparse, so expect a dub, a sub, and some trailers.<br /><br />This is a great own if:<br />-you enjoy movies with dual planes of existence (real world vs virtual world)<br />-want a non-gory, non-violent movie with development and conflict<br />-seriously, if you come from a large family...it plucked a heart string for me<br />-want a good example of modern Japanese animation and technique<br /><br />Skip it if:<br />-you only enjoy combat heavy anime (DBZ, Bleach, Naruto, Shigurui)<br />-want to watch an epic...it's not short, but you won't feel like you walked away from Mononoke or Evangelion<br />-if you're into collecting catchy theme songs or musical scores...Final Fantasy fans know what I'm talking about<br /><br />Koi koi!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game that keeps your mind alert.  Enjoy playing in the evening after work. Challenging and fun. Some levels are hard and there are not many hints as to next step, but fun overall.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Only a few draw backs &amp; they are ..... its hard to get shadow cards. But our fellow Blitzerz are usually willing to help out...<br />I really wish they would allow us to choose from a couple different power ups....<br />The tournament room is a joke.....considering the last 3 jewels are ridiculously difficult to obtain.<br />Other than those few issues [that bug me personally] its a great game!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The Alarm clock is great; allows full access to all content on the Kindle and you can set lots of alarms. everything you need so why buy one!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Often when artists chart new territory it just doesn't work out. Bands argue. Fans rebel. Experiments fail. It takes purpose, courage, honesty and wit to pull it off. In this album KT Tunstall leverages her experience and success to produce the album not that we were expecting, but that she needed to do. It works because it comes from a place of genuine introspection and expression.<br /><br />No, this is not the powerful pop rock of \\"Tiger Suit\\" or especially \\"Drastic Fantastic\\". It doesn't have the energy of her debut. It's closest to \\"Acoustic Extravaganza\\" if only because Empire is largely acoustic, but it is darker, slower, more mellow and pensive than even that. When we look at the circumstances that is understandable, but a woman less strong might not have handled those exact same circumstances as deftly.<br /><br />Granted, it may be no coincidence that Empire's best song is also its catchiest and the one where we most see the resurgence of KT's defiant spirit. Those who ask where the \\"wow factor\\" went need only listen to \\"Hallowed Ground\\" once or twice (or twenty times, as I already have).<br /><br />It's not just that song though. The album is very solid almost all the way through, with the \\"weakest\\" track being something she didn't even write, a cover of \\"The Boys of Summer\\" that feels a bit like it was forced into the album's mood. It makes for a slightly awkward finish and is really the only thing keeping the album from being perfect for what it is.<br /><br />Once Empire is in your collection it won't be something you listen to often, but when the time and the mood is right, you'll be glad it's there.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I laughed some much while reading it I was crying. I think she completely captured  how a man really thinks and their views on things. I would highly recommend buying this book..
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Yet another fantastic album from AFI. Their sound continues to mature and grow. This album sounds like something an experienced rock band would put out. It is a far cry from their early days in the East Bay but that's the best part about it. If you like any of the newer AFI albums (post 2001) you should love this. Dark, emotive, and carefully constructed.
B00BWYFTNG|4.0|This would be great if it didnt include Daryl. I'm not a Daryl hater but this action figure if him is a clunky piece of junk. This is a repack of series one and I don't see why anybody would pay a scalper $250 for it. The black shirt variant of his brother however is great, you can defanitly tell the improvement of products by mcfarlane through the years with these two guys packed together. Hopefully the Daryl set being realeaaed in march will have an improved figure. Until then I'm stuck with this crappy looking thing on my display.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The husbands secret is one that no woman would ever want to face. The story moves along well, I loved the very end where the author writes what could have happened in her characters lives.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I have an ice cream want some oh I  drop it I can buy some more.how May I help you.I like choclate. Here you go.thanks. that will be 5$.here you go.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This is a great game for the Kindle fire.  Works very well lots of rooms to search, plenty of hints but objects are easy to find but not too easy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lot of fun. Good way to pass the time. Keeps you entertained for hours. I would recommend it for all ages.
B00514HDNW|3.0|The movie was way better but I still liked the book.  I liked Robert Neville but the whole part where the bacteria mutates and the vampires become half vampire and half human was weird.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome movie for the whole family. I've been waiting for a movie like this for a long time now. Two thumbs way up!
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|Stanley Kubrick is a genius. Watch this movie and then, watch it again. Then try watching it for a 3rd time. In between one of those viewings watch the movie &#34;Room 237.&#34;<br /><br />Then write cryptic words with your mom's lipstick on the walls (especially if the wall faces a mirror). Then watch the movie one last time before your surprise 60th birthday party. You'll never forget it.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|The great Gatsby not so great. I like Leonardo Dicaprio and Toby McGuire but the story line was rather boring.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love the characters, the stories and the way the relationship between these two is written.  I wish there were more episodes!
B000LJ9ZWO|2.0|As an adult this movie is bad!  No real plot and bad acting makes this movie go on forever and ever....
B005LAIHSG|4.0|A mystical Snow White (with inner beauty) to destroy the most beautiful Queen ever (Theron) Oh my. I'm real glad the Queen was the fairest of them all, complete with talking mirror.  I laughed my butt off when the 7 dwarfs arrived.  So many people are focusing on the beautiful Disney cartoon version of Snow white that they lose sight of what is taking place here.  A world being ruled by an Evil Queen whose beauty is only an exterior illusion, and underneath is something more uglier than a viper.  A kingdom like that is destined to fall to Snow White. Whose beauty is on the inside.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book really opened my eyes to some truths regarding gluten. Though I'd tried diets and work outs, the weight not only wasn't coming off, it was still coming on. After reading this book, I decided to &#34;call the author's bluff&#34; and test it out for myself - abandoning gluten (and all of the delicious cereals, breads, and pastas I so love to eat) entirely. It also encouraged me to begin researching other unhealthy eating habits that I might be blindly permitting of myself. Following my 'kicking gluten to the curb', I've also eliminated GMO corn and other grains, grain-fed beef, and dairy too, discovering that each of these are either genetically modified (to the degree that the human body can no longer process them as they once did) or (in the case of livestock and poultry) injected with growth-hormones as well as being force-fed grains which require antibiotic treatments to keep them from dying off before they're sufficiently fattened. I'm not saying it was easy giving up the glutens (or the meats and dairy) - I love them! But at 57 years old and 300+ lbs, I decided that I love my family more and if I had any intention of not dying from a heart attack or risk invalidism from a stroke - negating my ability to provide for and protect my family - something needed to change.<br />My nutritional outlook changed. And now, just four weeks into the game plan - I've already lost nearly 14 lbs... without as much as one push-up, sit-up, or lap around a track. The exercise is coming (just need some more weight stress removed from my knees)... but the author's bluff was no bluff... you can... no, you WILL lose weight and regain energy simply by eliminating the genetically modified insulin-wrecker that we still, ignorantly, think of as wheat. Buy the book - read the book - change your life - save your life.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I found this particular case from Marware on sale. It was less than $10!!!! It's great for multi-tasking and the revolving feature is great!
B008M7JODC|4.0|Fun show to watch if you dont have cable . Lots of episodes per season which is always a plus for us.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show, love the character development and the court cases; have enjoyed each show immensely and would recommend it.  Great to have on my Kindle Fire for free as a Prime member (so worth it) as I can take it just about anywhere with me.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I started out thinking &#34;Well this is gonna be another Transformers&#34; but boy was I wrong this is not what you might think. Edge of your seat action from start to finish. A definite must buy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This group of books were different then what I usually read.  But I did not like Bared to You.  Really sorry.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|this movie was just as I remembered....so good!!! things are never as they seem to those on the outside! life is a gift!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app works great on my Galaxy Nexus.  Now I won't have to carry extra baggage (books) when I go to appointments.  I'll be able to read from my Kindle for Android App!
B002XBVQKW|5.0|I watched this in theater when it first came out.  I loved it and so did my husband. Great songs!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|My wife and I watch it with our son! Good stuff.  Cleaner than most popular TV.  Cant stand that we have to pay for latest season though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very fun game to play I love the fact that it makes you think thanks for making this game
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Good app overall. My only complaint is that it is slow to load. Great look and cute sound effects. Enjoyable for all ages.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|love the first 13 levels. game stops working at that point. I have reset game 3 times and all 3 times it stopped.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Great!!! That simply explains my feelings toward this series. Delivery was fast. Product condition A+++. Can't wait to pop it in the DVD player!!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I really liked the first one and this is even better. I am classed as a senior citizen so this game knows no age limits.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game!  Can be quite frustrating!!  : )  Give it a try!  Thousands of people can't be wrong can they??
0753827662|5.0|Book is great!!!  Met all my expectations and will pass it along to friends.  Received it very fast in the mail and was completely satisfied!
B00ESF285S|5.0|Another classic that I can now read and share on my kindle.  I can read it to my granddaughter, but soon she will be reading it to me.  Great to have on trips.  I prefer books instead of watching videos.  I am so glad that Dr Seuss books are available for my kindle.  Great buy
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Amazon finally returned candy crush yeah. However you are unable to collect lives or gifts.  I am unable to collect tickets to move to New levels. I am unable to use gold bars I have to make purchases.  You have to sign on to a pc to do these things so this version is somewhat frustrating.
B002RI9YHS|4.0|very interesting reading about feynmans experience in the challenger inquiry.<br /><br />not as good as surely you're joking my feynman but still worth a read.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|The costumes were authethentic,  Robert Redford and Mia Farrow look like my concept of how they would be,  Sam Waterston was brilliant.  The movie was a snap shot of the slower pace of life in the period as compared to the newer version which is too glitzy and the casting was not as good.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|I watched the series when it was originally on TV in the 1980's. I still love it. The main characters are like old friends whom I haven't seen in a while. The story lines are  often thought-provoking as well as intriguing mysteries.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Azlan always writes well,  The book was an interesting historical story of who Jesus really was.<br />I recommend it to any right wing political person.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|First, I am a Stephen King fan and overall think he's an excellent author.  That said, this particular book lacked the chill The Shining has.  Maybe if the book didn't have ties to the Shining, I wouldn't be rating it as I am, but it is and I expected more.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|the casting was not good.  Toby Maguire is not my concept of Nick Carraway,<br />Gatsby does not look midwestern enough as DiCaprio.<br />I can't even remember who portrayed Daisy and Mildred was terrible compared to the older version.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|An amazing. Tale of greed lust fire and desire with dashes of duty drive the story forward. As powerful and blinding as contemporary politics suck as Nixon's downfall, travel gate, Clinton's legacy, and Obama's failure to restore propriety, along with our current political system of lobbyists and bitter wars and genocides all taking place right now on our planet. I don't believe the intrigue and plots can get any better!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|Simple concept demonstrated with real stories that aids understanding.  Excellent  book.  I have recommended it to my friends and colleagues.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that I can finally play Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle! I really love this game! Thank you!
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|I love watching any Batman Superman movies.  This is a real favorite of mine as it looks into a world that Batman is setting up for after he is gone and the Justic League to no more.  Would love to see a follow on.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|tried a range of games and all worked well.<br />learning curve requires a bit of attention in some games but consider it part of the exercise.
B008Y212PI|3.0|I like this game. It's fun and works well, but there are a few things I'd improve. More levels, quicker processing between screens for example. This
B0052RDHTM|1.0|Ken Follett is one of the most interesting writer of literature today. He must do amazing research to present his characters so precisely. I also learned so much about this period in time in the most pleasant way.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  How can you not love a man whose only form of ID is a Ralph's loyalty card.  And the Credence tapes, you probably won't get those back.<br /><br />That rug really tied the room together.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Jaden carried the movie, wish that dad, Will, didn't have to play such a stern parent, I know it was just a movie, but . . .
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app every night at bedtime and any time I need to relax.  Super customizable, lots of different sounds from which to choose, and some good presets to boot.  My favorite thing about this app is being able to adjust the volume on the sounds independently so you can really cater this to your wishes.  This is by far one of my favorite apps...love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I confess, Candy Crush is my crack. I love this game and play every car I get. Have even dreamed  about playing.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|PRO(S): It's new Donna Summer! Any Summer fan knows that it takes a long time to get some new Donna Summer music. This release is a mix of the old and the new: Old songs set to a new sound. It is well worth the wait! You get great dance beats that vary from traditional classic remix structures (ie. Hot Stuff) to really unique sounding not so traditional remix structures (ie. On The Radio). Even better, you get Donna Summer singing her classics to the sounds of today DJs/Remixers. If you're a dance music lover and you enjoy more than one subgenre of dance music, you will enjoy this album. Having an unreleased track (ie. La Dolce Vita) is also a plus. Those are extremely rare. This album is also available as a deluxe edition on iTunes, digitally.<br /><br />CON(S): As an album compiled to honor the life and voice of one of the most versatile vocalists in music, Love To Love You Donna has failed on one level: Allowing a Donna Summer song to be featured on this track list, listing it as being 'by Donna Summer' when, in fact, it's not Donna Summer singing on the majority of the song. I am referring to track #7 on this release: Working The Midnight Shift. Official premieres of this song were revealed online and once fans heard this song, it was clear that it was not Donna Summer singing on the majority of the track. In fact, Donna is only on this version for about 15 seconds from the time count of about 3:24 to 3:39 of the song. The actual singer on this version is, I believe, a female singer who is associated with the remixers, Holy Ghost. I have no issue with cover singers. I just feel this cover version should be on a covers tribute cd, not on this compilation. Donna Summer should be the only vocalist singing on the tracks featured on an album that is in honor of her voice. I'll say it, again,...her voice!:)<br /><br />SUMMARY: All in all, this is an awesome set of remixes in honor of the woman I call 'The Voice\\". It will attract Summer's usual fans and new ones who are into today's dance music sound. If you're not into today's dance sound, you may not like Love To Love You Donna. However, I think there's something for almost everyone. Hopefully, this release will lead to other Donna Summer releases in the future. Let's hope so. Aside from track #7, this is a must purchase for Donna fans, fans of the DJs/Remixers, and newcomers.
1439153663|1.0|The book resembled  the novel &#34;THE HELP&#34;.  For some reason I took exception to this .  It was not a word for word similarity but the concepts etc , in my opinion, were there.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I play a lot of games on my kindle, until a warning popped up one day saying that my internal space is low.I searched everywhere until I found this. I saw that the reviews were really good so I decided to download it,  and boy am I glad that I did! I cleaned EVERYTHING and got 2.6 gigabites back. Thank you so much!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book held my interest and has a good base story.  Looking forward to the next book.  Hope they find some of the creatures are compatible.
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|I only watched the movie to see Terrence Howard, one of my favorite actors.  It is a good movie, but I felt that it could have been better.  I don't know how, but when I was asked to review this movie, I had a hard time remembering what it was about.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I never would have thought of a story where all the people who got super powers became super villains.  And I am kind of tired of the post apocalypse type story, but somehow I couldn't stop turning the pages.  I think the hardest part of a book to get right, and the part that often disappoints is the ending, but this ending was great and I am looking forward to the next installment in this series.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Awesome! Season one was really good and season 2  has me hooked right away! I'd be lost without Lost haha
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Absolutely great conclusion to a masterfully crafted story. Justice was done to Jordan's legacy. I will miss the characters I have come to love but am satisfied that the potential built in the series was achieved in the culmination of the novels.
B00821PCJS|3.0|A little slow sometimes and people just doing really dumb things; which I hate as in the show &#34;Lost&#34; (like don't leave the prisoner alien with out a guard!).  However, so far the first season was watchable although can be dark and gross with alien guts and so on.  Not for kids!
1401938906|5.0|I had the privilege to visit a remote section of beach in Hawaii where a monk seal had delivered her pup.  While standing on a cliff and witnessing this beautiful mother and her off spring I was amazed to see that the pup that left the mother's side and made a perfect square in the sand.  I immediately christened the pup Baby Einstein.  When I saw the title of this book I knew that in following the dots of synchronicity it would be a good read for me.  I wasn't mistaken.  A great reminder about the power of our thoughts in the manifestation process with easy to do exercises.  Take Baby Einstein's advice and check it out.
0062082353|5.0|I had heard about Chris Kyle, and thought this book would be interesting.  I am normally not much of a reader, however, was optimistic this would be a good book.  I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't put the book down.  I took it with on a cruise and finished it in two days.  Easy reading and a great story.  I found this an easier read than some of the other autobiography's out there.
0670024856|5.0|When I turned the last page of this book, I sat in wonder and said to myself, &#34;How did she do that?&#34;  This book appealed on many levels.  Scientifically, it was interesting and educational - historically it brought the era to life - spiritually it explored alternative beliefs, but as a love story, it almost broke my heart.  A sweeping, wonderful read that could only have been written by someone who had delved deeply into life's experiences.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Have watched the show sporadically for two season and decided to start at the beginning; New favorite show! Binge watching season 1.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|&#34;King Khan&#34; really showed his acting talent in this one!  It is nice to see a movie where he ACTS and which is not full of sidebars of cheerful music and dancing.  The story brings to light some aspects of Asberger's Sydtome and even more powerfully, the effect of 9/11 on law-abiding Muslims and Sikhs in the United States.  This is a look at how generalizing people based on appearance or last name is devastating.
1439156816|5.0|I used to love King, back in the 80s but since the 90s nothing of his has clicked with me. This was the one that did, and may cause me to take another look at his more recent work.  The first half of the book is a sort of autobiography with insight into how and why he became a writer. Very entertaining and interesting stuff. The passage where he made his first real book sale almost brought me to tears. Good stuff. The second half of the book is King's attempt at how to be a good/successful writer. Very insightful and full of great details on his methods and thoughts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for any hopeful writers, King's instructions are priceless and enlightening.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I enjoy the story and the truth it presents. I think back and remember the time when I witnessed the actual excitement. I could't believe Penny is still alive and kicking!
B000002GYN|3.0|This is a roots album for the group.  More banjo and country flavored than later efforts, but still the harmonies they continue to the present.  I got it primarily for &#34;There's A Train&#34;, but solid Eagles.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is a gift. I get to experience a relearning of languages that I thought I'd lost. I'm taking French now and going to take Spanish and Italian after that. I can't wait to take a new language...maybe Portuguese!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is an amazing album. Still has a classic rock sound like old black Sabbath but you can understand ozzy a lot more now!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I still remember reading The Shining and wondering what would happen to Danny Torrance. This story does not disappoint me. It is Dan's story and only refers back to his father Jack when it adds to new story being told. It was good that Stephen King waited this long to write Dan's story after he had personally gone through recovery. We readers were not aware that The Shining was very much King's own story, but now we know it is encouraging to read Dan's story.<br />This book stands on it own even with the references to The Shining. If you have not yet read The Shining, do not think that you need it to be able to read Doctor Sleep. Go for it. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've enjoyed playing on my desktop for a long time...NOW I can play it on my Fire. Thank you Amazon
1250038820|5.0|Brandon's labor of love shows in every image and every question answered. His first book is an awesome tribute to the people of New York and exactly what makes those of us who live and work here think that New York is the Capital of the World for it's greatest asset. It's People. Brandon has created a magnificent work of art. I was in tears when I first opened the book and saw the beautiful portrayals of New Yorkers. Brandon is our favorite transplanted Human of New York!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does everything it claims to well.  So much easier than the Roku and \\"Smart\\" DVD player I was using.  It is fast, and that counts for a lot. Setup was easy.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Do not anticipate a critically acclaimed masterpiece. Critics rarely appreciate action flicks and have little respect for sci-fi regardless.<br /><br />This movie is good fun. Drop your brain at the door, get some popcorn and turn up the volume. The governments/people of the world unit to create monster bots that are piloted by a team of two mind-linked for each robot. These machines (human powered transformer type bots vs. Godzilla, Mothra, etc.) Lot's of explosions and pyrotechnics. There is a little character development between a few characters, but it does not get in the way.
B0076HNCTQ|4.0|Season 1 of Twin Peaks was revolutionary, clever, twisted, dark, and funny. An American Classic from the odd David Lynch. The first 3 episodes in particular are brilliant. Sadly, Season 2 didn't quite live up to the promise, but was addictive nonetheless.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it's there when I need it ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, this says it al.......l GOD BLESS the person who thought to put on Kindle
B00C5R8364|5.0|As always a great book from Frederick Forsyth.  His only problem is he doesn't right enough. I'm going to reread the Dogs of War.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|Without a doubt Motorhead has one of (if not the longest and most consistent streak) in all things hard rock and heavy metal. Lemmy is the definition of hardwork and success and at almost 70 years old, he has released one heck of an album for the awaiting masses. I wont get into too much detail as 1) most of you have your own opinions and have already heard this killer release. 2) I have to write a college paper so I will keep this brief haha.<br /><br />Aftershock is one of their best albums. With the speed, intensity, rasp from Lemmy's aging voice, and some major blues influences this might be one of my favorite Motorhead albums of all time. Not Ace Of Spades nor Overkill, but something different, something new. Whenever most bands decide to release an album (especially those in age) its primary purpose is for those die hard fans from the days of old. With \\"Aftershock\\" Motorhead has changed the game! Aftershock is a great album and is possibly a great album for a new fan to get into. Its accessible, it rocks, it shocks all those who doubted in this band.<br /><br />I'm excited to say that I cant stop listening to this! I'm glad Lemmy has recovered from the illness he had prior to Aftershock. But friends, metalheads, rock n roll fans, if you play this album on high blast, I assure you the ground will quake. And beware for its usually the aftershock that catches people off guard.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|it maybe ad-free but does not work with the kindle fire! We had to remove it from his play list so that he can play another type of game that he really likes.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This book is wonderful. I had a hard time putting it down. The worst part is that I have to wait for the next one.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I have it on my IPhone, Ipod and finally Kindle Fire has it so i downloaded on Saturday, Oct. 19, 2013 and i am currently on Level 36.<br /><br />Having loads of fun, know a lot of people playing it.  It's a must have game.<br /><br />Enjoy all you Candy Crush players
1586210912|5.0|This is an awesome CD set it is packed with info on having a mind set to making more money. Where as poor dad wanted an education and safe job. Very motivational.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, Amazon has added this game to their store.  There is no substitute for this maddening and addictive game, and I had been checking for months to see if it was added.  For months, I have been disappointed. Not anymore. HUZZAH.
B00622D3BS|3.0|I enjoyed the ending.  The whole movie just seemed to be aimless until the end and then it came together and made some sense of the previous stuff.  The ending made it worth watching but I would not want to watch it again.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I must have watched this movie at least dozen times but it never gets old.  I love it.  The picture quality was good.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I liked this game and have it on my Kindle iPhone and iPod and each time I get to level 23 I get within 1 candy of completing it. I refuse to buy power ups.  Seems like a rip off to me.  Sorry.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very &#34;true to life&#34; situation. It is difficult to imagine the feelings of these poor children and nice to know that some people were accepting and kind to them.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn never fails to satisfy that underlying darkness in all of us. I can never put her books down and once I'm finished can't wait for the next. A guilty pleasure.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the best Stephen King book since &#34;The Stand&#34;!  Hated for it to be over...but at last, an ending to love.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Really liked this game. Wish they made more at this price. Its fun and when you think you've figured it out you havent.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'm giving this book to special people this Christmas!  There were so many twists & turns, that each page turned led to a surprise.  Good charactization, too.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I found this book on the best sellers free, and so glad I did. Once I began reading I could not put my kindle down.....I stayed up past 3 am trying to finish it.highly recommend if you like action and love story
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game to play with increasingly difficult levels. It can be challenging but, it's still fun. I like the fact that my friends can help me.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|For all the hype these books received no one ever said there was a story to be told.  Held my interest  but I was not offended. I am waiting to see if she writes anything else...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|not to hard not to easy. addictive fun with challenging levels with interesting power ups. fun for any skill level.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|The problem with the tudors is a flaw in the dvd when Anne Bolyen is about to get her comeupance. The dvd stops and is not restartable. I tried umpteen different ways and could not get the end of the dvd to play. There is another place where a dvd stops but after a few different tries I was able to foward and then back slow mode and get almost to where it had stopped. That is a pain but at least curable unlike the other problem. I did not need to see Anne get beheaded but the interruption in the continuity really ruins the whole set for me.
B00F880BWG|4.0|I really liked the cliffhanger ending on this one. The season seems off to a great start, but you know something has to come along to shake up their peaceful little prison community!
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Stop wasting your time reading the reviews - order it asap and DIVE into this latest album of Sir Elton. It is a pure jewel where the crystal voice of Elton and the light of his piano playing take you to a very special journey... Emotions Vibrations - even some (too short) dream parts.... this CD is a work of heart....
B007AL48UK|3.0|Cute tiles, but very difficult to see on Galaxy 3 phone.  I realize it's more a device limitation, but they could have altered the tile design to make it easier to see them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's a great book for all Stephen King readers especially if they read &#34;The Shining&#34; - I couldn't put it down
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Typical sudoku game, but the summer themed backgrounds were a nice change of pace from the typical monochrome backgrounds I usually get.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I feel that the movie was very well done. I was captivated throughout. I would like to see a sequal ....thanks
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|\\"Hesitation Marks\\" is clearly the work of an older, more wisened TR. Now married, the father of two children, and clean from drugs, he's not the same man he was twenty years ago when he released \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Broken.\\" Trent's slowly grown into middle age, and his lyrics here reflect that. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" still carries the same dark and serious approach that has pervaded every single NIN work, but now TR doesn't sound nearly as anguished or conflicted.<br /><br />Understandably, Trent's later output has begun to divide his legion of fans. Starting with \\"Year Zero,\\" he's begun to incorporate a more electronic, less acidic sound. With \\"Marks,\\" his approach on most of these songs has become even more sparse and peeled back, often reaching moments of mellow introspection. The rage is quieter; the melancholia less acute. (In the case of \\"Everything,\\" Trent hits a note of unparalleled upbeatness.) Naturally, within weeks of the release of \\"Marks,\\" I've heard a barrage of NIN fans criticizing this new direction, crying out for a return to the abrasive, industrial sound of his earlier albums.<br /><br />I, however, respect and appreciate TR's desire to defy expectations and his refusal to simply repeat himself. As much as I love the raging, corrosive sounds of \\"The Downward Spiral\\" (probably his best and most powerful work in my opinion) and the \\"Broken\\" EP, I also fully support Trent's need to branch out and explore new avenues as an artist, and I frequently enjoy the results. I may not always like where he decides to go (a lot of \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"The Slip\\" just didn't work for me, for example), but I want him to continue striving to be a multi-faceted artist rather than a one-trick pony. (If all he came up with was \\"Downward Spiral\\" Vols. 2 & 3, would David Fincher have chosen him and Atticus Ross to beautifully score \\"The Social Network\\" and \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"? Think about it.)<br /><br />I enjoy who Trent became on \\"Year Zero\\": less of a victim and more proactive in repairing the dystopian world around him. \\"Hesitation Marks\\" is a natural extension of \\"Zero,\\" only now he speaks of having repaired himself. The lyrics of \\"Marks\\" describe having \\"come back\\" from dark places, Trent rising from the ashes as something new and more powerful than he was before, yet still trying to find a place of enlightenment and security. It suggests a kind of inner strength that \\"Spiral\\" and \\"Fragile\\"-era TR struggled to possess.<br /><br />Much like \\"Zero,\\" there is a lot in \\"Marks\\" to love. All of the songs are well-crafted, thought-out, unique, and are exceptionally mixed and mastered. Not every song is a winner (\\"Copy of A\\" and \\"Came Back Haunted\\" are just okay in my book, and \\"Running\\" and \\"In Two\\" are not my favorites), but Trent has demonstrated that he's still a talented rock artist capable of true quality, even if it means eschewing money, success, and the appeasement of fans who cry out for more of the same.<br /><br />If you're looking for the loud, caustic, tortured sound from previous releases, you may not enjoy \\"Marks.\\" However, if you're seeking another singular chapter in TR's decades-long ledger as an artist, pick this one up. I count this as another work in a catalog by a man who constantly challenges his listeners as well as himself.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|This season was even more disturbing and gruesome than the first, but Jessica Lange is so fantastic, I had to keep watching.  Seeing her character's transformation was worth suffering through all the cringe-worthy, brutal scenes.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The show lost a lot of good characters in season 1 & 2. I don't think the lineup is as strong in season 3. The story was kind of goofy and seemed contrived, but still fun to watch.
B0089LOG02|3.0|The subject has been well documented but this author really made it come alive.  I was not aware the trains ran well into the 1900's.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|It did not work properly, has a false contact in the jack =( I am very frustrated with this purchase!
B00932A4XE|3.0|So-so movie.  Has humor, but overall not that impressed with acting. Lots of big names, but they don't live up to expectations
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I love this App because i can share my pictures with others and all my computers and phones.  Very easy also.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|5 stars cool i love it what a awesome idea it is better than Mine craft the best game I've ever played so addicting
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The characters seemed one-demential.  There was so much of one person's conversation to another as opposed to developing the actual characters.  Whole story lead in one direction instead of creating more interest in the narrative.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|That is the best game ever,it is hard but I love playing the game. I am so happy it is on my Kindle.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Watched all the movies with my granddaughter.  Now she gets all the references in the new movies.  It was great fun!
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Great fight scenes. Was like Power Rangers on steroids vs Godzilla. Kid friendly except a few words halfway thru movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great ending to the trilogy!  It had some really good twists & turns!  I didn't want it to end!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG finally they have candy crush saga i just want to get it earlier than later but love the game I MEAN
B009NX1YT6|5.0|A great family classic.  Great soundtrack too.  They don't make them like this anymore.  I would recommend for a fun family movie night.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|FUN for all ages... Only downside is there are not enough rounds in the game... After an hour or so playing the game is finished...
B007SGM084|5.0|The complete bundle is mind blowing. Am hooked! I can't wait till the movie comes out. That Mr. Christian Gray was something else; it's going to be a challenge to find someone to capture all his characteristics. I enjoyed reading about every character and how each event kept me dangling while exceed my expectations. Wow, what a emotional roller coaster. Thank you for the experience.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I loved this book.  I felt as if I was there.  I learned a lot about Abraham Lincoln.  He was an amazing man.  I highly recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|so far so good (Frederika Bimmel !!!!!). have all of  Stephen King's books.. He makes this old lady&#34;s day...long wait between books.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is an incredible movie. the special affects are great. the characters are well played and the music is spectacular.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Gotta love a good episode of Star Trek, and the remastered shows are really quit aw-sum. Well worth watching on Amazon.com
B007WDPPK8|4.0|I like this book because I prefer knitting in the round and this book allows me to create my own patterns and offers a multitude of techniques.  The section on binding off is particularly good because it is easy to bind off off to tightly when working in the round and this can ruin your project (or at least make you miserable while you pick out your bind off to redo). I liked the section on how to solve the problem with &#34;jogs&#34;, a typical knitting in the round issue when you end one round and begin the next.  There are a wide variety of projects including hats and gloves.  Also, she covers both bottom up and top down techniques.<br />My only complaint is that the samples used to demonstrate the techniques are very small, doll sized sweaters.  I understand that these are designed to be samplers for the techniques but I am very unmotivated in using my expensive, beautiful yarn to create a sampler.  I would rather take on a regular sized sweater and have something to wear when I finish.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|keeps me busy and out of trouble...there's always something new at each level that takes a while to figure out.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|A long-missed set of tales that were read to me as a tiny tot. Many years had passed since I heard these last. That Kipling book really hit the spot!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a great app and I can take it anywhere I go. This app will help u with things that u don't kno
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a terrific book on the history of development of nuclear weapons in the US. High-level strategy intertwined with personal stories of the people involved, make this book reading that you can't stop. The only drawback of the book is that it tells US story, and there is little information of what other countries, especially Soviet Union, did in nuclear weapons development. But, its natural, in the US there are many open sources of information on the subject, while in other countries not. Highly recommended reading!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes! I was so excited to see this game had been added to the app store iv played before on the iphone and was addicted to it great game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|cant stop playing. have it on my i phone and kindle. my grand daughter showed it to me now the whole family play it.
1400052181|5.0|This book is a page turner, and one that will grip you and challenge your thinking and your sensibility.  Very well written, and the story pulls you along in many directions, and will leave you pondering our medical and scientific communities and how they work with patients at times.
B0083VE37Y|4.0|I'm knocking off a star because I don't think her recent output is quite as good as her earlier stuff and this CD doesn't contain some of my favorites, but no-one, not even Her Madgesty Madonna does perfect 3 minute pop like my favorite diminutive pop strumpet Kylie. It's a fascinating, but gappy trot through her career and if a few of these songs don't get the other old timers like me up and dancing awkwardly, then there's something wrong.<br />A pretty good introduction, though honestly, if you love Kyles, you already have most, if not all of these songs.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I kept waiting for the secrets to be revealed and as each one came another question arose. This book was wonderful and hard to put down. I absolutely recommend this book!
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Not sure why this movie was so well received. While I can see it being a fun ride in a movie theater, that same experience does not transfer home. Overall though, a good, mindless action flick.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the previous version. I don't hate the new version but it could be better. I agree with another reviewer, I just want a weather app. I like new cool things but this is a little different. I will keep it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not so much a sequel as a continuation of a character. Stephen King has grown as a writer and I found this book refreshing. I love how he brings his characters to life flaws and all. I devoured Dr Sleep too quickly and went back and read it at a normal pace and enjoyed it immensely.  He returns to an adult Dan Torrance who struggles with the outcome of a traumatic stay at the Overlook as well as the alcoholism that changed his father into a monster<br />It is in facing his demons and using his shining to help others find peace as well as coming to the aid of a young girl struggling with her shining that he finds redemption.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Full of detail and excitement! Makes you want to keep turning the page to see what happens next.  Can't wait to get started on the next book.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It is easy to use , great to look at and l love the fact that the forecast is so specific to the area that I live in.
B008Q08EG8|5.0|This movie portrayed the Duke at his finest. The cast was great, but John Wayne truly made this film what it is, which is a five-star movie.
B0090SI460|5.0|I am a collector of Disney movies and I keep my eye for the ones that hit blu ray.  I love how quickly this was shipped and the condition of the box.  It is one of those with the cardboard slip cover and usually that is damaged in shipping, this one was in perfect condition.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book love it especially the ending i can't tell u but its twisted to find out u MUST read this book right now
B006FE83U4|5.0|I had to purchase this movie for a film studies class and it made more sense to buy it due to how long I needed the movie.  The movie was packaged well for shipping and in perfect condition when it arrived.  If you haven't watched the movie yet, I recommend it.  It is a great film and tells a great story.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|the book kept my attention all the time. I only dislike the fate of my favorite characters (the Stark family).<br />I would recommend it to friends that enjoy fiction.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I haven't read a Stephen King novel for many years and certainly wasn't disappointed when I read this one. Very different from his usual horror stories but no less gripping, it is a true page-turner! You don't need to be a King fan to enjoy this book.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game is fun as well as easy play for all types of age. i love this game and hope for updates and future greatness.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i should be sleeping but the minions are keeping me running around. love this game. graphics are great, and if not lagging, gameplay is excellent.
B002BWPWB2|5.0|Nothing like Boris Karloff read this one, it is profound. Questions of power, unintended consequences, hubris, love, the limits of creativity, And more.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Can run things like Skyrim at max settings (at 1440 x 900). Just got it for my father's new computer. He likes to stream videos but this was kind of overkill for it. It is not for a real gamer, though. No APU can beat the CPU/GPU combo yet, and probably never will.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I'd never heard of Lindsey Stirling before one of the young men I work with played her first album from his work computer. I'm in my late 50's and most of the music my much younger coworkers play has me reaching for my ear plugs, or my mp3 player and noise cancelling headset. Not Lindsey Stirling. I couldn't hear enough. I researched her background and found that not only is she an amazing talent, but she is a pretty amazing young lady.
0812550757|5.0|Its been three thousand years since Ender Wiggin saved humanity by obliterating the \\"buggers\\" who threatened our survival.  In the convening millennia humans used technology from their vanquished enemies to colonize roughly a hundred worlds all connected by \\"ansible\\", the instantaneous communication device engineered from the buggers own mode of communication.  Though communication is instantaneous space travel is not.  Each of the worlds is light years, and real time years, apart and space travel is a lifetime commitment making the ansible necessary to unity among the human worlds.<br /><br />There has been peace for three thousand years, a pax humana, in which humanity forgot the threat of the alien buggers and history has turned from hailing Ender a savior to branding him a xenocide, a monster.  Then, on the planet Lusitania, a new species of intelligent life was discovered.  Are they a threat on or an opportunity for humankind to take what they learned from the destruction of the buggers and grow?  In steps Ender Wiggin, determined to not only defend the new species, but to revive the buggers, after defying time by traveling at light speed, only stopping at a world for a few years at a time, for three millennia.<br /><br />Speaker for the Dead is not only a gripping story that science fiction fans will like, it is a meditation on what it takes for people with profound differences to move toward one another in understanding rather than turn away in fear before trying to know one another.  It is a rare book that teaches as it entertains, and an even rarer science fiction book that does so with a balance of character development and action that keeps you turning pages without space battles or explosions on every page (not that I don't like an epic battle or a huge explosion!).
B001TKD4ZI|2.0|I'm not sure what to say first... Should I mention the total idiocy of the whiny heroine? Maybe I should talk about the complete absurdity of the hero?  Or, how about the threat of a covert government group with five members?<br /><br />Cliche beginning... The heroine is in the Witness Protection Program because of and is now on the run from, none other than the Russian mafia. Complete with an idiot Russian vampire!  She is saved by the absurd hero.  She is secure behind dozens of massive bodyguards etc... And wants to leave at every turn.  She's happy with him for about five minutes of every day. The rest of the time she thinks he's evil, or disgusting, or many other things...  But she admires him for saving human lives with his synthetic blood.  I kept wishing she would make up her mind.<br /><br />Then, Roman, our absurd hero... He's a 500+ year old ex-monk vampire.  The monk in him does not allow him to see that he's not completely damned.  Every thing is his fault. Every death is his fault.  His synthetic blood invention saves countless lives, and allows vampires to co-exist peacefully with humans, but he sees nothing but his broken vows.  I kept asking myself why, if he had all that guilt for 545 years, didn't he kill himself a long time ago?<br /><br />And then there seems to be the covert CIA team of five people that can't be mentally manipulated.  They are mentioned along with the heroine's father early in the book, but only show up at the end. They too, ignore the inventions of the absurd hero (and his many friends) and condemn all vampires to death.  And yet they save the absurd hero, indirectly, hoping he'll die instead...  Really logical thinking there.  Since there are now fourteen books in this series, I'm guessing this was to be part of another book...<br /><br />This was seriously painful to read, however, it was well edited, and the characters were pretty well developed.  They were all idiots, but you got a good grasp of where they came from and why they were there.  So... I gave it two stars instead of three because I really wish the characters had not been idiots and the heroine less wishy-washy.
055380684X|5.0|I like this book because it informs about what is actually experienced in life (myself being kind of old) - this being that one has to work at something to succeed.  And not only that, one has to work at something in a particular way to gain full benefit from one's effort.  This is somehow reassuring, considering I now don't have to feel so bad about not having any real talent.  However, through the course of reading, considering what Mr. Coyle is saying, between the lines one might be tempted to ask \\"If all there is to talent is patterning, why really bother?  After all, the benefits are really narrow in the great journey of life - and the benefits are not even permanent.\\"  I can't help but think perhaps the truth informed in the The Talent Code provides contrast to older wisdom.  For example, the Oriental religious practice (e.g. Buddhism, Taosim, etc.) informs one to return to the Primordial - presumably prior to myelination occurring as in a newborn infant. The Buddhist path to enlightenment could also be construed to argue against the premise of 'The Talent Code' (i.e. trying to be good at something in a systematic manner), where, for example, the Buddhist Heart Sutra (Red Pine translation) says (something like):<br /><br />Here! Shariputra, everything that one experiences in this existence is defined by emptiness [i.e. will eventually be meaningless];<br />Therefore, in emptiness there is no knowledge, no attainment and no non-attainment [i.e. the talent one is seeking will eventually dissipate with no lasting effect];<br />Therefore, without attainment [i.e. not seeking a talent], seekers of enlightenment take refuge in [universal wisdom];<br />And live without walls of the mind;<br />Without walls of the mind and thus without fears;<br />They see through delusions and finally, enlightenment!<br /><br />I don't know what to think about this - so will study it more deeply!  Maybe one goal - the one most prevalent in current society of seeking attainment as TheTalent code espouses - is not at all what we as sentient beings should be doing.  Who can really say.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was worth waiting for this story.  I love the way he tells his tales, I read this slowly and paced myself so I wouldn't devour it. Glad Dan's story is complete.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephen King. Grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go. Great ending. One his best in a long time.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I was happy to see this come out on Blu-Ray as I had been waiting for the whole set.  I actually still had it on VHS (I don't have a VHS player anymore so its been a while since I saw the movies.) but I wanted it on Blu-Ray so I waited.<br /><br />I watched all of them again over a couple of days and the films look great in this format, and at the price offered it was fantastic!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!! It is sooo additive, I can't put it down until I run out lives. I am so happy amazon finally put it on kindle fire. Thank you.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Limited choices of content, but for the most part gets the job done. I would like to see more options in the future.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Excellent TV show for the whole family.  A pleasure to watch.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes period programming as well as high quality acting and cinematography.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was one of those books I hated to put down!  You become so attached to the characters especially the book thief.  The story told so much about the characters and their struggles in Germany during world war two.  This is a very touching book and one you will not forget after you finish it.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|I rented this movie because I have enjoyed the Star Trek series since its inception.  I guess that makes me old.  In any case, this movie has a lot of hot-dog special effects and is small on depth or dialogue.  This kind of thing is likely going to be around for a long time to come.  Doubt if I'll ever watch another &#34;new&#34; Star Trek movie.  The kids should enjoy it.  But if have to tell you, Chris Pine is no William Shatner, or the kid who plays Spock, is no Leonard Nimoy.  However, the kid who played Sulu was brilliant!  Much better the George Takei.
140006922X|4.0|Bought this for my husband, he really enjoyed the book.  I intend to read it next.  He said it gave an interesting profile of Jesus.  Alot to absorb.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This author has a good track record, and this book adds to the list.  The tale and characters are engaging.  The story loops around to pulls ends together.  We get a look at the culture of Afghanistan once again - and at the change in those who literally move away from the country and the culture.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Wasn't great but I liked it better than the previous version of Judge Dredd. Worth a watch if you get if for free on prime.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I was skeptical when this show was announced, but I have to say it's amazing.  The acting is fantastic and scripts are great.  It never fails to make my skin crawl.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|No Disrespect to Dominic Chianese because he is a MAGNIFICENT singer!!!!!<br /><br />This MUST be a comedy recording...<br />I didn't make it past Reed talking about \\"Cutting his tits and legs off\\".<br />GOD AWFUL!!!
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|The detail is amazing on this figure. I haven't been this excited for movie figures since the re-release of Star Wars IV in the late 90's. These are definitely worth the money and are already collector's items. Don't miss out because only a limited quantity and once they're gone...they gone! And go buy the movie Pacific Rim! It'll rock your socks off!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Finding pride was a wonderful book. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. It is a pleasure to read such a good book.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This book is very entertaining.  Originally I gave it five stars, then backed off to four because I realized I could not remember much about it even though I know I enjoyed reading it.  To me, a five star book would be unforgettable, but the details of this one have left me.  The lives of two girls, one who rode on the orphan train and the other in foster care of modern times meet and find support in each other's company.  It's a happy ending book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it truly is an addictive game I haven't been able to stop it every morning and throughout the entire day even at work
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a great book. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I look forward to whatever happens next!
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Right up my alley. Seen it years ago. Glad to see I can see them all now. Do not like being told how many words it takes to say I like something.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|As The Walking Dead has evolved, we've seen so many of the key cast members killed off in horrible ways that losing someone whose name isn't familiar seems almost a cheat.  Still, this season seems to be quickly reinforcing that there can be no normalcy, no safety, and that even deaths from natural causes are a threat to the survivors.  At some point, you know they will all come to a bad end.  So each episode becomes an exercise in figuring out who will be the next to die.<br /><br />Excellent work by the writers, the cast, the special effects crew, and of course, a talented rotation of directors who always seem to get it just right.  It's the only television show I watch.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|While I enjoyed Teenage Dream I have to admit I missed elements from her debut album. Prism is a wonderful combination of her balladic first album and energized second.  The first half of Prism had me wondering if this was Teenage Dream 2.0 but the second half brought it all together.  Very happy with the purchase and looking forward to the rest of the creative videos from this release to start coming out.
B000007T1M|5.0|The first album from this killer rock act. Its raw and in your face. Serj can go from screaming his lungs out to a soft yet melodic voice. Spiders is my favorite track on the album. Overall I LOVE this album.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|It's all in your mind how hungry you are. This is good for re training your brain. On the fasting days you still get to eat. it makes you think about how much yo do eat on your non fasting days.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was an interesting read.  Not the typical jail house experience, I am sure, but insightful.  Give it a read.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This is a really fun game. It has just enough difficulty to be interesting without being frustrating.  The game mechanic is perfect for a touch device.
1401384854|5.0|If you do not know much about the Korean waer this is the book you need to read or listen to.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's nice that the app opens right to the radar as well as the current forecast. Getting around on the app is easy and user friendly. Sometimes, the maps open a little slower than I would like, but you can maneuver the map and zoom in to your street to see the weather coming. That's nice when you live in an area that gets weather coming off of the Great Lakes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is so much fun and I can't get how real the graphics are in the game. that is  way I gave this game a five star
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Great writing unbelievable acting. But what makes this show a top dog is their co stars like Michael J Fox,Gary Cole, Martha Plimpton,Mamie Gummer. A worthy show to continue watching the rest of the seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|With a perfect WiFi signal app won't connect to Facebook. I don't want to have to start at level one when I've already made it to higher levels. Guess I won't be using the Kindle app to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy the variety that this game offers. There is something to keep all my kids busy and games for me too. There aren't many games that have something for the whole family, but this one captures an array of games to please those of all ages.
B009LDD22U|5.0|A nice combination with DVD and Blue ray .....  The extras are a fun addition...  and the show is great!  highly recommended
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|I love this album....I'm not sure if Paul is getting younger in his older age or what ??? He's incredible !!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game feels so real. I love how the horse reacts to how you play with it. I have a horse and some times I wish he would be like the horses I have on this game. Love this game a lot. I am pleased with it .
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I wouldn't let the kids watch it, but it's a great movie for any adult who enjoys anything zombie related. Brad Pitt was typical Brad Pitt ... excellent.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is awsome game. I really like how it gives you challenges and fun dragons to race and compete in the game. I am pleased with my Dragonvale.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could only imagine (but really feel) the position the husband's secret place on the wife.  What would I do in her position?
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app seamlessly goes with google calendar, and allows you to keep a better calendar on your smartphone than google calendar.  It is awesome!  Easily more usable than any other calendar I have tried.  Plus, it works great for those of us whose schedule changes weekly and who have varying time schedules for work.  The reminder system is fantastic an easy to set up.  Plus, you can set up different ones based on the activity you are scheduling.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We love Candy Crush and waited a long time for it to be available on the Kindle. Great way to pass some down time.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|The dvd alone is wonderful, but the digital copy that was included is fantastic!  It was easy to access and it is a great addition to our mobile devices!!!
B002SHD9E2|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is a great movie. My all family watched and enjoyed. My daughter is 10 years, and she really liked it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Cover fits our Kindle like a glove!  Love the strap on the back for easy handling.  The folding cover/stand is great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great and easy to use.  It saves your entries just like a tape calculator,  which you can view.<br />Love it
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  A great story about a disfunctional family torn apart by alcohol and the will to survive.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I love how Doctor Who touches on small details, slipping in hints here and there throughout a series, then in the season finale, everything comes together in an exciting, heart-wrenching, fulfilling journey. Season 4 is no exception, with the return of some our favorite characters and the introduction of new ones that will become quotable favorites. (Jethro anyone? &#34;We've broken down . . . in the middle of nowhere!&#34;) Another overarching story of friendship and finding oneself in the midst of impossible circumstances.
B009CG29RK|4.0|Really liked this movie. Cute for kids with some adult humor. Fun story and looking forward to the second movie.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Wonderfully quirky movie. First saw over 8 years ago and I still love it. A must see for the introverted romantic :)
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I was expecting a lot from this book from all the good reviews. It is a series of interviews each telling their own story through the apocalypse. I found it hard to keep reading since there was so many stories, not just a single plot. Each story is good on its own but did not have connection to each other. I did only get half way through it before I put it down.
B007VTUYWW|1.0|wHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT... SHE CAN NOT ACT IN THIS FILM BUT I GUESS SHE DOES NOT NEED TO ACT
B003K1EYM6|5.0|A connector is a connector, and a user is a user, and a camera is a camera. All three of us work.
0226264211|5.0|Outstanding discussion of the subject.<br /><br />Cut through the political manipulation thrown at you everyday.  Read this as a beginning to your understanding the ideological rhetoric surrounding you so that you may determine the threats to your freedom and financial security and.....decide and then support and vote for those that support your position.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is my grandsons favorite movie & he wanted us to share it. We both love this movie. I decided he should own it.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Interesting  lives intertwined in this rustic village.  The conclusion of each episode makes me want to see what happens next.
B000W9399S|5.0|I love he Discworld series, and COLOUR OF MAGIC is the most entertaining one in a long list of great books.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I really like Dr. Perlmutter's take on grains and the biochemical process of the brain. even if you don't wish to try this lifestyle, he makes some super points worth checking out.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is a pretty good game.  I'm not wild about it and don't play often, but it's cute.  Worth the $.99 cents.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally an android app is available! I would ask for more lives as you progress the more difficult levels of play.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the challenge. Look forward to additional levels. Would like to be notified when additional levels are available. Would recommend.
B001TH16DI|3.0|I watched the first Disc (Motion Picture &#34;I&#34;) and I know a part was cut out of the Blu-Ray version.  When Chekov was hurt on the bridge and Ilia walked over to say I can remove his pain.  That was missing.  So a few parts are cut maybe that is why I was not to excited about the Blu-Ray editions...
B005MMY9A8|4.0|A good fun piece of entertainment. It was a pleasant distraction.<br />Not terribly thought requiring but a good amount of action.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Bob indeed was quite a cat. Bob and James Bowen the man who rescued him -- or was it the other way around -- is a charming tale of Bob the street cat and the growing relationship between the two of them. Bob needed James but James needed Bob even more. At times I found the book a bit repetitive but well worth the read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|M y daughter recommended this title to me, I was experiencing a lull in finding stories that really absorbed my attention.<br />This incredible story is one of those you just can't put down, mind  expanding adventures.<br />I'm now reading book 4 in this series &#34;Children of the Mind&#34; .<br />You won't regret purchasing this quintet, mark my word.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|II'm not a game person but like this game.  Its easy-to-use since I don't play.  I would like it a bit slower thougt.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing Solitaire on my phone It's a great pastime and really convenient when you need a little something to pass the time.
B008O6KIRM|5.0|family and kid friendly movie, chipmunks are always a good movie, very funny, no bad langage or questionable scenes in the movie
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Wry. Dense. Overwhelming.<br />Similar to Special Topics in Calamity Physics.<br />Brilliant Author<br />Allusions innumerable<br />6 more words required before submission
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This is a fun game but I do not know how people can say it is addicting I reached level 8 the first day I rec'd it  It is a lot of fun
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is a very powerful book. It pushes limits, breaks hearts and always, always makes you think. It is much more complex than most young adult novels in its challenges of what is logical versus what is right. The characters are infinitely human, neither heroes nor villains, at least not fully.<br /><br />Tobias reveals vulnerabilities I never would have guessed he had, and yet, they were completely believable and right for his personality and past. I loved that half of the novel was told from his point of view; the darkness and desperation he fights against were so intense it hurt my heart.<br /><br />Tris' side is less complicated and she doesn't change as much as Four, but her coming to terms with her family, living and dead, strengthened her character in subtle but significant ways. She gains a deeper understanding of things, which in turn gives the reader a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations.<br /><br />While I loved so many things in this book, the writing didn't really pop as much as the previous novels, at least not for me and not in the beginning. At first it felt like a lot of exposition as a hundred new things had to be explained all at once. This might have been necessary, but it was also kind of awkward. Towards the middle it gained more intensity and the pace picked up, and by the end I was on the edge of my seat. Crying.<br /><br />The end was perfect. Heroic and sad and beautiful and unexpected and so very, very brave. Not just on the characters' parts, but on the author's as well. She took a unique path that, upon the arrival of the last page, made the whole trilogy fall perfectly into place. It was an ending that left me recalling earlier scenes with an 'Oh' of revelation that it was all leading to this.<br /><br />This novel is a worthy addition to any bookshelf.
B005IQZB14|5.0|So good! Inspirational read. So happy I picked this for our neighborhood book club. Lots of things to ponder and enjoy in this book.
B002NNA9N0|1.0|Stupid movie. Real stupid. Dont waste ur time. Not worth writing any more words. Really? 6 m o r e
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great calculator - very simple to use. Would recommend to family and friends. It has become my go to calculator for everything!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I got this app for free and think it's great. You can put in your zip code and have weather reports for five days.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After playing this for months on my smart phone, it is a bit daunting to see it so big on the kindle fire. I live the fame, it is addictive and fun to play. A good way to waste some time.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill's voice is a treasure and the combination of talent and tunes is a great.  Pedal steel is one of my favorite instruments, so this is a win win!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Thank you so much for getting this to me so quickly. I plan on watching the entire series after I have received them all. Waiting on Final Season release!
B007RCJNDE|4.0|The last book in the series of The Wheel of Time lived up to my expectations.  All the major characters had their battles to fight and it was good that some lost yet most won.  Couldn't put it down.  At first  I was a little startled by the ending, yet after a day to two, I began to think that it was just perfect.  Incredible story and not just this last book but all of them. Robert Jordan must have had a marvelous vision for a saga of this mangitude.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Thank you so much for getting this to me so quickly. I plan on watching the entire series after I have received them all. Waiting on Final Season release!
B003N7ORNI|3.0|In all honesty, I think the major difference is the protagonist. While the protagonists of this series are good, they are not equal to Percy Jackson. Besides this, the main difference is that probably because this series is smaller the development of characters is a bit fast paced and unnatural. A few important facts could not get enough importance (Bast's guilt comes to mind).
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Thank you so much for getting this to me so quickly. I plan on watching the entire series after I have received them all. Waiting on Final Season release!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I didn't want to buy the blu-ray that they have available in the stores right now, so when i found this i was ecstatic! it was brand new and  came to me very quickly!
B000HKYA1I|5.0|Wonderful movie. Thought provoking. Hilarious and moving simultaneously. I love this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B001HM1PFO|3.0|Entertaining. Content crude. Not as good as Dracula , but silly and funny. It was better than any of the stage plays that I have seen.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Wasn't sure about this movie during the preview..Kinda looked like an Ironman spoof but there was definitely no lack of action..I'd recommend..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game exciting and fun to play with levels for everyone and gets harder and harder by the level. Thank you for the game
B0094BB4TW|5.0|works great for me on my new android phone.  its facebook... how do i exactly rate that. not much different from anything else
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I chose to rate this movie a four, reserving the fives for movies that are &#34;life altering&#34;.  This is enjoyable family fare, but perhaps not for the single-digit kids.  The plot is pretty far fetched, but that's probably true of most fantasy fiction these days.  Adults will be happy with great picture and sound and well-done special effects.  The child actors are really quite good, and the puppy love between the two leads is endearing.  It's nearly two hours long but goes by much faster, never once bogging down.  It's simply a wholesome popcorn movie that the whole family will enjoy.  Definitely worth watching.
B000VAABC6|5.0|Definitely one of the best interpretations I have heard of the variations in a while.<br />Frankly I am not the great Gould lover so many seem to be. Give me Andras Schiff's<br />Goldberg Variations also on ECM on piano any day over Gould and Jarrett. Nonetheless<br />this is a beautiful rendition.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|expected more for a Dan Brown.  it was good I guesss but it was jist kinda missing something. maybe you'll like it
B005S39YGU|2.0|Watched this because it was recommended, but it is just not a show that seems very funny to me.  It is interesting to contemplate the many different kinds of humor that some people find funny and others not at all funny.  Most TV shows today that are claimed to be comedy seem to me to range from just not very funny to reprehensibly disgusting.  It is curious that nobody today seems to be able to come up with comedy featuring genuinely talented people instead just constantly pushing the boundaries of decency. The hilarious &#34;art&#34; of comedy that wonderful family-friendly shows like Andy Griffith, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, and &#34;I Love Lucy&#34; achieved seem to be a long, long lost art.
B00FF8OKJE|2.0|I love this game and admit I have probably spent more money on it than i should, but every time there is an update I am locked out of the game for several hours. It tells me an update is available and i cant play until it is updated, however when it sends me.to.the ap store the update isnt available. :/
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's not like all of those other games like bejeweled. It continuously gets harder as you go along. It never ends! If you like complex games this is the one for you.
0345806786|5.0|after organizing my boyfriends book shelf. i ordered a couple Stephen King books that i know he didn't have. when this one  arrived (much sooner then expected) he says to me &#34; oh honey i have read this one already&#34; i was a little sad, till i seen the look of excitement all over his face. &#34; but i wanted to read it again before reading Doctor Sleep, its truly a great story and the two go together&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive absolutely love this game one of the best I have played in a very long time .. have all my friends playing it!!
B003VB5E2E|5.0|The CROSSROADS GUITAR FESTIVAL this is my favorite especially the last minute appearance of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi Band. The whole show is just great.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Pro-Entertaining<br />Con-Some levels are too boring due to the extent that the computer plays against you. Keeps you too long on the puzzle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Please note that this product comes with a US wall-plug - since it was intended for US sales only but due to a glitch in Amazon this could be bought elsewhere in the world this might be good to take note of)<br /><br />What you get:<br /> * 3 meter USB cable (Micro-B to Type-A)<br /> * USA wall-socket adapter to USB Type-A (powers the chromecast)<br /> * 30 centimeter HDMI extension cable (in case you have a tight fit behind your TV)<br /> * And ofc, the Chromecast itself.<br /><br />The only downside to this marvelous product is the fact that it can't power itself via the HDMI outlet on your TV.<br />There's rarely any mention or picture of it in any of the products images that you NEED a external power-supply.<br />Google assumes your TV is modern enough to have a USB plug at the back of your TV which mine didn't, luckily my amplifier does which sits below the TV and just happen to be in a perfect distance to be useful with the USB cord that comes with the Chromecast.<br /><br />All in all, great product which finally delivers what for instance Apple does via AirPlay.<br />You can now watch stuff on your TV and thanks to my 7-HDMI-input amplifier i can also play music via this very tiny product. What you essentially buy is an AppleTV but in a super-slim form-factor which isn't \\"proprietary\\".<br />(With AirPlay/AppleTV I'm referring to the ability to watch certain videos and listen to music via your phone streamed to your HDMI-input-compatible media-player with very little effort and without any cords. AppleTV obviously have some additional features that you will not get from Googles chromstcast just yet, but then again.. This is being developed as this review was written).
B000AY74OG|5.0|It was a brand new DVD and unopened one. Even though I received after a week of ordering it, its still worth to have it.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I had looked all over for this. My friend told me to check with your website.  I did and was very pleased.  Thankyou for having this in stock and at a good price.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Emotional story that really puts what is important in life into perspective. Definitely a must read. can't wait for the movie to come out!
B00402FGE4|5.0|I had been looking in the stores for SGU and a friend told me she saw it on your website.  Thanks for having this in stock.
B00FPGV3RS|4.0|I have to be honest...I am a huge Jeff Bridges fan. Starman started it all. That being said...I really enjoyed enjoyed this film. Had lots of actors/actresses that are very talented and the banter between Bridges and Parker (who by the way plays deadpan to perfection) is so funny I nearly hyperventilated. It is not the best movie I have seen, but so funny. By the way...has Kevin Bacon played a good guy since hollow man?
B004VOBIE8|5.0|While this is not exactly the same GUI as MS Explorer, it does the same and more.  This turned my KIndle Fire into a computer.  I understand computers, I do not understand Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is FINALLY available for the kindle fire hd ... It's a great game. Recommended for people of all ages.
B0052Z3HUS|4.0|Sometimes annoying a boy, and some extremes of luck and heroism for the djinn. But great fun! And a great read!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written, not at all what I expected. Each turn of the trip was a surprise. Can't wait to read another of her books. I am not a soap fan, not a trauma drama, not even a &#34;sexy&#34; story seeker. This book has so many layers, twists and truly ups and downs but an enjoyable time is spent until the conclusion.......or finish.  Keep going, write more!!!!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Iv'e been a big fan of the British comic for awhile and so going into this movie, I was kinda skeptical.<br />Forget everything about the Sly Stone version, that's crap. This is the real Dredd. A perfect adaptation on the screen, and that's rare. Karl Urban plays Dredd very well, the tone of the film is right on point with the comic, it even feels like your dropped into Mega City 1.<br />Never a dull moment, well paced and worthy of other sci-fi movies such as \\"Total Recall\\" and \\"The Matrix\\".
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game it is the best and I just can't get enough of it I play it constantly.  I just bought this and I already fell in love with it!  AWESOME.right?  Despicable Me:minion rush is awesome and amazing.  I &lt;3 this app.  :) :) :) :-)
B00DW1WR14|4.0|I've read a lot of reviews here on this album, and most of them revolve around two things. 1, Everyone want's the old PJ 2. Everyone want's it to be different, evolved, and so nobody is happy for what they are now.<br />Now I'll give you my review. Iv'e listened to it at least a dozen times, so I'll just say this: This is a good album. Like it or hate it for what it is. It's no \\"No Code\\" or \\"Binaural\\" But it's a good album.<br />So, here's whats good about it. The production is very good, the crunchy guitars boom loud, Jeff Aments bass is greatly heard on this album, and you can hear it in songs like \\"Getaway\\" and \\"Pendulum\\". Gossard and McReady work so well together, combining great riffs along with actual solos. Vedder is...well Vedder, his voice is always great and you can hear this passion on every track.<br />Lyrics are meaningful, a lot of songs about love and life and growing into adulthood.<br />This is a good album, made by real musicians.<br /><br />KEY TRACKS<br /><br />- Getaway<br />- Fathers Son<br />- Pendulum<br />- Lightning Bolt<br />- Swallowed Whole<br />- Let The Records Play
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Very fun addictive match three game. Cute cut scenes of village constructing, although I wish there were a little bit more backstory on the game. Good for any age players.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|Rhonda breaks down the process of attraction, both positive and negative.  This book opens one up to a different way of thinking and processing your world.  The law of attraction has many ramifications that will challenge conventional thinking.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors, this book  did not let me down. Vince Flynn's sad departure from our world is tragic. I am sure his last book will be on par. He will be severely missed by his fans.
0452295548|5.0|As a 30 year R.N., I knew physiologically exactly what was happening to Dr. Taylor, but most 'lay' people would not, so I greatly appreciated her ability to describe what happens during a stroke in terms and descriptions that could so easily educate non-medical readers..it could possible save someone's life! She is obviously a brilliant human being and researcher whose personal journey is not only educational, but truly inspiring and shows how the power of positive thinking and attitude can be absolutely transformative. A must read for anyone..I've given this book and shared Dr. Taylor's story with a great number of family and friends, as I'm sure you will also..<br />J.R., Arcata, CA
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was by far the best biography I ever read. If you haven't read it buy it!! It has a balanced mix of good and bad. Impossible to put down

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad you finally made this game available on the Kindle!!! I looked for it but I only found Candy Swipe.....didn't like it at all!!!
006202406X|5.0|You worry, when you love a book, and its the start of a series, about whether the rest of the books in the series can deliver. When INSURGENT came out, I bit my nails, my expectations were low, and it floored me. It was great! But it only raised the bar that much higher for the conclusion, arguably the most important book in the series. I couldn't wait for ALLEGIANT, but I was nervous.<br /><br />All I will say is that this book DELIVERS. Its the real deal, and I finished it feeling so satisfied. The series in all was a fantastic ride. I can't wait to see it interpreted for the big screen!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie.  There is too much left out of the book to the point that my wife had to ask a lot of questions to why something was happening.  The acting was really good.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|You all know that guy....The \\"superfan\\".  That pretentious little twit who knows \\"everything\\" about your favorite band and looks down his nose at you while displaying his vast array of knowledge.<br /><br />You want to punch him...Not just because he's a tool, but because he does know so much about the band you love, and you can't bring yourself to admire him for his vast knowledge.<br /><br />Fear not...No need to feel inadequate.  I have found the great equalizer.  Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage lets you in to almost every dirty little secret you would ever want to know about \\"The Stooges\\" told by the boys themselves.<br /><br />Some of the highlights include:<br />- Rush playing to a bunch of preteens who smile politely and clap while secretly asking themselves WTF is up with this band?<br />- What were the boys doing in their hotel rooms during their tour with Kiss while Gene Simmons was bedding everthing with two legs?<br />- What were the boys smoking when they made Caress of Steel?<br />- How the Band got their break because some program director in Cleveland was searching for a track to play while her DJ's answered the call of nature.<br />- How the professor went from an International Harvester Tractor Parts Manager to one of the greatest drummers ever to grace the planet.<br />- Laugh while you watch a pimply faced Alex Lifeson try to justify to his parents why he should quit high school and skip \\"University\\" because he DOESN'T want to drive around in a big car and make lots of money...(good one Alex...I'll help you take some of that evil moola off your hands).<br />- See the boys in their ridiculous Kimono phase and get a load of Alex's Flock of Seagulls inspired hair lick.<br />- Find out the origins of Rush's brief foray into Rap music and did they just say \\"kick some Gluteus Max!!!???\\"<br />- Rare footage of Neal Peart actually smiling.  Yes folks you heard it right.  The professor not only smiles but laughs as well.  So much for the Neil Peart is an android theory.  Put away the Voigt-Kampf test Deckard, Neil is not a Replicant....He just plays like one...<br /><br />All these nuggets and countless more are available at your fingertips<br /><br />On a more serious note, you will get to know the lives of these three amazing musicians and how they have managed to stay life long friends amid great personal tragedy.<br /><br />This movie is an unflinching look at one of the most marginalized bands in the late 20th century and how after nearly 40 years, these guys continue to pack stadiums and while others are resting on their laurels, these guys still manage to put out more and more original content.<br /><br />You don't have to be a Rush fan to enjoy this movie, but after watching it you are likely to become one.<br /><br />That's ok...Jump on the bandwagon that many of us have been on for sometime.  There's plenty of room, and these guys totally deserve it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have a hard time seeing things and this is great, because of the size. I would recommend it to anyone who is sight impaired.
B00FVAEKJ6|3.0|I love FlipPix Art puzzles and have purchased all of them.  It has been a pattern however of getting fewer and fewer selections with each new release. This latest puzzle has only 6 or 7 puzzles per topic compared to 11 or 12 from earlier choices.  This is my only reason for 3 stars.  If it had more puzzles per topic it would get 5 stars. I am worried that with each new release I will get fewer and fewer puzzles. It is very annoying!

B00F91SCXC|5.0|I do not like zombies movies, but my kids wanted me to watch it, so I did. It was a great movie, with a good story line. Most zombies movies do not have a good story line. Great movie, high action.<br />DLM
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting a lot for this game!, this kindle version have nothing to envy to other android version! No problem at all.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I've bought a few copies of this over the years, and gave them all away to friends. I really love this movie, and I'm not normally into anime. It's a really great story, with an interesting visual style.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was compelling enough to finish, but somewhat slow.  Many sections of the first half seemed overly detailed. The last part of the book picked up, and the final &#34;what if&#34; section was well done. There are some odd moral/social views: fat equals not attractive, murder can be forgiven if it's impulsive.  I'm not sorry to have read it, but wouldn't push it for others.
B00280LYIC|5.0|For those expecting another Harry Potter, turn away, because there is only one and only one Harry Potter; and there will never be another.<br /><br />Besides the general genre of \\"hero-quest\\" books with superhuman characters geared towards a younger audience range, Percy Jackson and Harry Potter must not be compared. The styles of Rick Riordan and J.K. Rowling are entirely different.  Rowling creates another fantasy world almost entirely separate from a time period of any era with distinguished and proper writing. Riordan on the other hand crafts humor through blunt sarcasm and prose, relying heavily, much to my dismay, on current slang that will outdated in 10 years and simplistic prose and dialogue that can sometimes be quite irritating.<br /><br />If you like Greek mythology and suspense, you will (most likely) love these books.  If you can stand verncular, \\"slanged-up\\" writing I highly recommend these books.  Despite the slang driven and simplistic writing, I love these books and am a die-hard fan of (both Rowling's and) Riordan's most popular series (I count Percy Jackson and the Olympians and The Lost Hero as one series).  I have not outgrown these books geared towards 5th graders and never will.  I have simply accepted the fact that, I can't expect better writing from characters supposedly around their middle teens.<br /><br />My advice is to read the first few chapters of The Lightning Thief. If you like it keep reading, if not put it down and read something else.  In this particular book, the author jumps right into the story, and it is very easy to tell if you will like the next 9+ books of not.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Of the three iron man movies we thought this one was the best!  We hope they continue to franchise with more.

B00FEHXISA|2.0|Iron Man 1 and 2, I think were much better. Lots of action, It would seem the writers were running out of ideas and started looking for a way to put away end Iron Man, witch they did - for now.<br />Without spilling the plot, you just have to see it.

B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Compared to the first G.I. Joe movie, I think this 2nd installment of the movie is &#34;Boring&#34; to say the least ! With out Bruce Willis it could have been better, He does not fit in to this kind of movie.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I can not believe I wasted my money on this terrible book. The first two books were amazing. I have been dying to read this one but the author just kills off Tris.  What was she thinking? I am so disappointed with this ending that I am actually angry about it. I felt to me that the author wrote this as fast as possible not caring about her fans at all. I really can not recommend this book to anyone at all. Such a disappointment.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|It's not the movie, I don't like, I saw this in &#34;standard definition&#34; from Amazon. Nothing could be worse then there SD. !!!<br />Save your money on this, you won't like. Go with the HD, a world of a difference ! (for a buck more)
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Only had this watch for a limited time but so far very happy.<br />As another reviewer stated, putting hours on an inner scale with the short hand and the minutes on the outer scale with the big hand is simple and logical...it's just one of those things that you don't think about until you have it!<br />The watch us light, understated, but appears well made, I also like the see-through back.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I purchased this game over a year ago on Amazon and started playing on my HTC Thunderbolt.  I got quite far - over 600 levels completed and had quite a stash of gadgets, upgrades, etc.  About 3 months ago, I switched to a Samsung Galaxy S4 and downloaded the game again from Amazon.  Unfortunately, all my progress and my stash was gone.  Not expecting much, I emailed the company Halfbrick and asked if they could help.  While not able to recreate my progress in the game, they were able to restore a bunch of my gadgets and upgrades.  What a great response!  I would definitely not hesitate to purchase another game from them.  I also noticed the great changes they made to Jetpack Joyride in the last few months to keep it fresh and entertaining even after playing it for awhile.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it... Good to kill time.... My son loves it....Just challenging enough to not frustrate you and its just fun
0810970686|5.0|My grandson is a third-grader whose reading had been at most a chapter at a time.  That is, until he got this book!  He started reading it and couldn't put it down.  He read the whole book in one afternoon.  He even chose it over his computer games!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game.  Wish there was a little bit more energy however u do gain it back pretty fast. Can't put the game down.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is the best Star Trek movie made so far. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone I know.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|It looked like a cool game, but when I downloaded it it kept saying that I needed to update it.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|The storyline kept me thoroughly interested and engaged, with deep involvement with the characters and significant issues they are dealing which are deeply meaningful about the nature of humanity, family, and relationships.  I don't generally care for didactic or polemical novels, and this is not that, although one character does speaks polemically about the most explicit controversy of the novel.  However, that character's polemicism is consistent--and essential--to that character.  Other events in the novel complicate that character's position, while not undermining it.  It was heart-breaking at times, yet laced with humor, and certainly one of the best novels I've read this year.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This movie is ok if you like flash bang blow-em-up scifi. It for sure isn't realistic but it is entertaining to a degree.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great movie. My 3 and 5 year old kids laughed through the whole thing and is very entertaining for adults. Perfect for family movie night
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I saw the movie and then bought all the soundtrack and Rodriquez' two CDs. He has a very original sound that draws on a range of 60's and 70's artists for its roots. A little Byrds, Simon and Garfunkel, that funky Motown sound, Bob Dylan and others. A beautiful voice and original songwriting. Great music and a fascinating story that is now told in a well received film. My only complaint is that I got all three cds and there is a lot of overlap in the songs, but I think the deal was something like I bought the two original CDs and the soundtrack was an extra $5, so not a big deal, but if you want only one CD, get the soundtrack, as it has most of his best songs, but everything he wrote is worth listening to. A shame he didn't get picked up by a major label and produce more music, but a blessing that he did manage to produce two albums and it looks like he is leading a happy life
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie really grew on me with multiple viewings. Little details really add a lot as the script is quite lean. Beautiful visuals and excellent performances. It takes on a very dreamlike quality.

B00FPH3YQA|1.0|It's time for the Hangover saga to be finished. What laughs they managed to squeeze out of the second movie were all that these boys had left. Keep your good memories of watching the first Hangover movie...and let this one collect the dust on the shelf it deserves.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I wanted to give this 2 1/2 stars, but it wouldn't allow &#34;half&#34;. On the upside, this book kept my interest and didn't bore me to the point where I wanted to put it down and forget it. On the downside, I felt some of it was confusing. I felt like things were missing that would help understand more the whole wheel-turning aspect, how Dan's dad made an appearance and how Abra could have a physical presence with Rose at the end. I felt disappointed at the lack of clarity. I was also disappointed with the lack of &#34;spook&#34; factor.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE GAME IS GREAT BUT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FOR THE HOVERCRAFT AND THE BEACH LEVEL.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent book for book club discussion.  Very poignant . The issues deserve to be confronted.  We often try to avoid talking about certain conditions that make us uncomfortable, but this is a subject that should not be avoided.
1451626088|5.0|She is a master at historical fiction; all  her books are worthwhile. This one in particular shows the forces at play in thelives of Elizabethan-era women. If your only image of Anne of Warwick is from Shakespeare's Richard III, this is a good one to read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good beach read. I had a hard time finding the the plot plausible,  but the author redeemed herself in the end, ergo the 4 stars instead of only 3.
B00000JGHM|5.0|deniro, pacino, kilmer, sizemore, all the other dudes, plus tone-loc? one of the best movies ever. even jon voight is a kool kat hookin' thangs up for folks on the run. way too tight.
B009LOJK1Q|1.0|I just can come to terms with the fact that the same person who wrote the shinning is the same that wrote dr. Sleep.<br />Stephen king has completely lost his edge and even though he tries to give the reader a reason of his lack of talent with this book at the end of it with a note, I can't but feel saddened by the fact that one of the great horror writers created such a dreadful continuation of an outstanding book. I really think Danny and Wendy deserved a better fictional life.<br />If you really want to read the downfall of a great story the. You should definitely buy this book but if you'd rather keep in your memory one of the greatest literary pieces is our times, stay away from this.
1454701250|5.0|This is a beautiful and inspiring book!  I'm big into scrapbooking and with all of the copyright policies on rubber stamps, I thought it might be good for me to try my skills with making my own stamps.  This book is very easy to use and the techniques are shown with very clear directions and photos to walk you through each step.  Geninne's designs are so simple, but elegant and inspire me to want to create!  The only thing that would have been helpful is a list of suppliers that carry the rubber carving blocks, but I looked around at my local art stores and was able to find them!  I did find some nice white erasers to use, which I was able to cut my designs into easily.  However, be careful when cleaning the erasers, if you rub too hard, the plastic starts to rub off (after all, they are an eraser!).  I am so glad I purchased this book and it's a great addition to my arts and crafts collection, well worth the money!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game but needing &quot;energy&quot; slows down play.  That's how they keep it free though so hopefully you'll go to their sponsors.

B00BT70IWS|4.0|Record companies don't seem to be producing as many full-length operas as they used to, and there do not appear to be any clear-cut kings of the hill in the world of tenors anymore. So I suppose that German tenor Jonas Kaufmann has as much a shot at the title as anyone.<br /><br />His credentials: Kaufmann has a fine tenor voice, not really a lyric tenor, but having more weight, something of a cross between a spinto tenor and a dramatic tenor. He's also blessed with handsome good looks, with stylishly long hair on his head and a stylish stubble on his face. If this were the Fifties, Hollywood would snatch him up for a romantic musical. As of this writing, he is in his vocal prime, being about forty-four years old, he's been performing on the world stage since 1995, and he has over a dozen record albums to his credit.<br /><br />But does that make him the greatest tenor currently before the public? Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on your taste in tenors, I suppose. Anyway, I don't have nearly enough experience listening to opera to make any fair evaluation of Kaufmann as a singer, so I'll limit myself to some general observations about the twelve Verdi selections he sings on this album. For instance, it's easy to hear the man's voice has range, power, and flexibility. It's also easy to hear his voice is slightly coarser and deeper than a lot of tenors; thus, the characterization above that he is more of a dramatic than a lyric tenor. Nevertheless, it seems to work reasonably well in these arias, despite their being in Italian and not the man's native German. (Most of Kaufmann's early success has come in Wagner.) My only serious quibble is that the program features mainly Verdi standards, things most of us, even we opera novices, already have on disc by our own favorite tenors. I dunno; maybe this collection will grow on me if I give it a chance. As it is, I'm not sure it represents Kaufmann at his best.<br /><br />So, the album begins with one of Verdi's most recognizable creations, \\"La donna e mobile\\" from Rigoletto. It's a good song to begin the proceedings since it's not only familiar, it has all the wham and pizzazz you could want. It's the vocal equivalent of an overture, a curtain raiser, and Kaufmann belts it out with authority.<br /><br />Next up is a number more to my liking: \\"Celeste Aida\\" from Aida, although for me it still needs a lighter, airier touch. That said, Kaufmann produces some welcome vocal contrasts, handling the piece neither too gently nor too robustly.<br /><br />I admit, I know little about opera. Yet I sense more of the baritone in Kaufmann's voice than the tenor. Not that this is a bad thing. It demonstrates the man's vocal range, which is clearly quite wide and stable.<br /><br />And so it goes through the program, with selections from Un Ballo in Maschera, Il Trovatore, Luisa Miller, Simon Boccanegra, Don Carlo, La Forza del Destino, I Masnadieri, and Otello. There's quite a lot of different material in here, familiar or not, and Kaufmann makes the best of it. I wish I could say the same for the orchestral accompaniment, though, which seems a bit thin and flabby to me.<br /><br />Favorites? The aforementioned \\"Celeste Aida\\"; \\"Di quella pira\\" from Il Trovatore, only because the piece is so ingrained in the basic repertoire, and because Kaufmann carries it out with such theatrical flair; \\"Quandole le sere al placido\\" from Luisa Miller because it's so very romantic, and Kaufmann sings it with such heartfelt enthusiasm; \\"Dio, che nell' alma infondere\\" from Don Carlo because Kaufmann's voice sounds so good in combination with Franco Vassallo's baritone; and \\"Niun me tema\\" from Otello because of the passion Kaufmann expresses in these closing passages from the opera.<br /><br />I think most folks are going to like what they hear on the album. No doubt, it will please Kaufmann's fans. How much it may impress die-hard opera lovers, however, I couldn't guess.<br /><br />Sony Classical recorded Mr. Kaufmann at the Auditorium Niccolo Paganini, Parma, Italy in March, 2013. The sound is big and bold, a lot like Kaufmann's voice. The voice is well out front, clean and clear, with a fine sense of bloom. The orchestral accompaniment seems to fade closer and farther away with the changing dynamics, but it's not objectionable. Occasionally, the voice tends to get a bit bright, almost harsh, like, obviously, on big fortes and climaxes, but again this is not particularly objectionable, and in any case some speaker systems may mitigate the situation. In all, this is probably the kind of pop-like sound that most listeners expect, and a sound that probably complements most home playback systems.<br /><br />John J.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed the connection among the interesting characters. Everyone knows someone in their own life like the characters described in the book. I kept wondering how it was all going to get resolved, and in the end, it was very exciting.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I really like the calculator. The buttons and numbers are really big. It has memory, and shows last or whole calculation under result. It shows memory above it. Swiping memory keys gives you Pi, square, square root, and inverse functions. No other functions or parenthesis. It is great you can cut and paste. It has percent and if you use +% after a number, it will calculate percent and add it to the amount. Nice for figuring out totals with tax and/or tips.  No other functions or parenthesis, but it will do most of what one needs to do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app. It has big numbers so it easy to see and use. It makes my kindle even more use to me if it wasn't already great enough.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Uhg! Have never been as disappointed with a book as I am with Allegiant. I don't think I have ever cried this many unhappy tears EVER.<br /><br />I invested with these characters and in the end nobody was better for the experience. The Bad guys get to forget their evil and start fresh while the characters we came to love are either dead or having to continue with full memory of their loss.<br /><br />What was the point??? To learn that generally life sucks and you need to take the time to recognize the moments that don't? Guess what? That is a lesson most already know and try to use books as moments that don't suck!<br /><br />If you loved the first two books then PLEASE don't let this one ruin it for you!!!

B00ERIUO02|4.0|I think that Katy's new album is very different from her last album, it still is very good, but some of the songs have just way too much sound fillers. There may not be as many number one singles compared to Teenage Dream, but it still is an excellent listen!
B00FEX1AA2|4.0|Just a little slowness, but overall a well paced, freaky & frightening film that will stick with you for quite a while afterwards.

0307341577|5.0|I came across this book by surprise when searching for a new author.  I was pleasantly thrilled to read this book.  I love psychological, believable plots and characters.  All of the characters are believable - not just their personalities, but the history of their personalities, meaning of the actions, etc.  I feel the author did more than the necessary research to represent the mental and emotional issues of the characters - it was not only believable, but educational.  Forget all that though, this book is cliff-hanger and \\"I couldn't put it down\\" worthy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|challenging and infuriating.  I love it! it is fun to play against your friends and family.  I am so addicted.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works pretty well, but without the ability to stream whatever you'd like its a crippled device. Currently can only stream netflix, youtube, and google music (well), and chrome tabs (poorly).  Would live to see this device opened up to developers who can unlock its potential.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! I love the challenge of each level! Hope they will keep adding more. This game is on my phone, Kindle and iPad. Get it! You will,too, become addicted!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it would be a lot funnier. I did chuckle some through out it, so 4 stars.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|With my sons has enjoyed so much this movie. With a great message of courage, humility and family love despite and against circumstances.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this game. So far I have one horse, and a few friends. There is plenty to do from taking care of the horse, to training, competitions, games for earning health and happiness, and so much more. I spend too much time playing!
006202406X|2.0|I could not wait for this book. Almost a full year of wondering what's going to happen can drive an avid reader mad. So once I had ALLEGIANT in my hands, I was ready to see what author Veronica Roth had in store for her final book in the Divergent trilogy.<br /><br />This book is classified as a dystopian. It's a strict world that's built on secrets. There will, of course, be discord and chaos. This is also a war story--people are going to get hurt; other people will lose their lives. So if a reader approaches this type of story and expects sunshine and flowers, the story is already an injustice.<br /><br />Everyone has a right to their opinion, and you can get angry, and you can rage over the things that happen in this book; I've gotten angry over many books. I understand that expectations are high and when they're not met, it can dampen the spirit. But it's shocking to see how many people are docking this down because of the ending. I admit, I was unprepared for the ending. It was very sad and I don't agree with it, but it's not going to be a reason to dock this novel down on a rating.<br /><br />My major complaints involved the pacing and the merging of two points of view. The writing has always been an iffy point, but it was always engaging. I had such a hard time getting into the book. I've never been a fan of dual points of view and it doesn't help that Tris and Four sound the same. Also, for being narrated by two people, the views were so limited. It took forever to learn anything new. And their romance feels so forced. By the time I reached the middle, I was wondering if they were really a couple or just forced together under the circumstances. Those, to me, were the biggest letdowns.<br /><br />I'm still shocked by the low ratings for the ending. Save your tears for the narration and storyline instead.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had just about given up on him especially after &#34;the doom&#34; but thought I would give him one more chance, good thing i did<br />it is good, not as good as the shining, but a good follow (sequel?) up.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|\\"Love To Love You Donna\\" comes some 17 months after the passing of the Queen of Disco. It comprises remixes of some of her biggest hits as well as a few album cuts (\\"Working The Midnight Shift\\" and \\"Our Love\\" - the latter on the deluxe edition) aimed at the EDM/Chillout market.<br /><br />As with projects of this nature, not everyone (especially die-hard fans) will be pleased with what they will see as a desecration of classics, case in point being \\"On The Radio\\" which is given a spacey disjointed arrangement with Summer's vocals echoing into the ether. It has an experimental almost Alternative feel to it and I love it.<br /><br />Most of the remixes take just a few of the original vocals and juxtapose against an entirely different soundscape. \\"Dim All The Nights\\" finds Donna repeatedly bellowing \\"Dance Your Heart Away\\" against a sublime House backdrop.<br /><br />Standouts include \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" remixed by Giorgio Moroder and Chris Cox with a more electronic almost Dub Step feel, Frankie Knuckles & Eric Kupper's \\"Hot Stuff\\" transformed to a club banger with smidgens of the distinctive guitar riff and includes the rare additional vocal ad libs at the end, Chromeo & Oliver's synthesised 80s-sounding Funk of \\"Love Is In Control\\", Hot Chip's \\"Sunset People\\" which is a superb less frenetic alternative to the original (a longer more languid version sounding like a slowed version of theoriginal is available on the deluxe edition), Gigamesh's catchy and imaginative \\"Bad Girls\\" (there is a more stripped/fractured remix by Boys Noize Club on the deluxe edition), Masters At Work's Loungey \\"Last Dance\\" with additional bass,keys, and guitars and Summer's vocals given a more laid back pacing, and the lone new track \\"La Dolce Vita\\", a calming midtempo affair with scratchy guitars, Summer's more recent lower smokey vocals, and Giorgio Moroder's sad robotic voice intoning \\"...we miss her so\\", almost Daft Punk-like, until one remembers Summer and Moroder were producing sounds like this as far back as 1977 (\\"Dance Into My Life\\").<br /><br />\\"Working The Midnight Shift\\" features Summer on about 15 seconds of the song with some other female doing most of the song, a shame really as the musical arrangement is rather perky and catchy. \\"I Feel Love\\" appears in two versions, Afrojack remix (more faithful to the original), and Benga remix which is a House/Dub affair using just the chorus and some harmonies to haunting effect, I love it. \\"MacArthur Park\\" is frenetic Eurodisco reminiscent of Pet Shop Boys' \\"it's A Sin\\" Or \\"Always On My Mind\\", remixed by Laidback Luke.<br /><br />The CD is a digipak rather skimpy on photos (half of the cover photo is repeated inside), some track information but no booklet. Hopefully this collection will introduce Donna Summer to a new generation of listeners who will them seek out the far superior originals.ds like this as far back as 1977 (\\"Dance Into My Life\\").<br /><br />\\"Working The Midnight Shift\\" features Summer on about 15 seconds of the song with some other female doing most of the song, a shame really as the musical arrangement is rather perky and catchy. \\"I Feel Love\\" appears in two versions, Afrojack remix (more faithful to the original), and Benga remix which is a House/Dub affair using just the chorus and some harmonies to haunting effect, I love it. \\"MacArthur Park\\" is frenetic Eurodisco reminiscent of Pet Shop Boys' \\"it's A Sin\\" Or \\"Always On My Mind\\", remixed by Laidback Luke.<br /><br />The CD is a digipak rather skimpy on photos (half of the cover photo is repeated inside), some track information but no booklet.

B00C5R7F8G|4.0|The Titan silo incident in Damascus forms the backdrop for a summary of the US nuclear arms race.  Numerous other incidents are also described where we apparently came so very close to an accidental nuclear warhead detonation on US soil.  The story of inter-service rivalry and competition for control of these weapons suggests an underlying recklessness in our thinking and deployment strategies.  Discussion of the dilemma confronting system designers between a &#34;fail safe&#34; design and the weapon's &#34;readiness and effectiveness&#34; is interesting, but scary!<br /><br />A great deal of information is brought together in an engaging narrative -- a good book.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|To me, Symphony X and Iconoclast are what prog metal should be. The album rips right from the start and never lets up. The musicianship and arrangements are top notch.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I love it power ups cool and u should make a sale on hallaween and everything is free but still good game
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book has enough, and only enough, material to fulfill its objective in a clear and straightforward way. It helps!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|More challenging than the original.  Love it! Each board gives you more of a challemge than the prrvious one.  Can play a long time without getting bored.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|...Love it! It's very addictive. I just can't stop playing this game.You won't be able to stop playing once you start!
B00EMJBVAI|5.0|Just straight up fun to watch.  A bit of a different twist on the Zombie movie.  Don't come into this expecting the meaning of life.  This is a Zombie movie.  Just entertainment.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Reminded me of a Harry Potter type book for grown ups. The imagery is so vivid and the pages just keep turning. Loved it :)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I love this series and this books plot. Recommend highly. Similar to Scott Westerfield's writing and his 'uglies' 'pretties' series.
006202406X|1.0|It was depressing and hopeless beginning to end!  The book was mostly negative interactions between the main characters ---and maybe that's fine because you keep reading, waiting for the positive balance or something hopeful to come from their journey and sacrifice!  But it doesn't happen. I don't think it had to be ' a happily ever after'---but something that made the journey worth while,  because to me it wasn't.
B000067CQK|5.0|This version of Ziggy is an amazing collector's edition contains two tracks in the cd 2 that belongs to \\"Arnold Corns\\" the band that Bowie form in 1971 ([...] the tracks are \\"Moonage Daydream\\" and \\"Hang On To Yourself\\", great quality of sound plus other ziggy classics the demos of \\"Lady Stardust\\", \\"and \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and other songs like \\"John, I;m only Dancing\\", \\"Velvet Goldmine\\", \\"Holy, Holy\\", Amsterdam\\", \\"The Supermen\\", \\"Round and Round\\", \\"Sweet Head (take 4)\\" and the new mix of \\"Moonage Daydream\\"
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this story. The characters are vivid, it has heart, I was blubbering by the end. It's an unforgettable novel and I've recommended it to several of my friends.
B003DDKAT2|5.0|Classic , it left me hanging and begging for more-my daughter and I want to know when the sequel is coming out
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was great, could not put it down. I enjoyed the characters and story very much, S.K. did not disappoint.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Some how I can relate to the kids in the Goonie category.....<br />I grew up a nerdy, awkward, thick glasses, mouth full of braces, on the chess and debate team teenage girl. Definitely not a boy magnet-I thought I was cool, and so did the other Goonie kids I hung out with. We had a great time!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite apps! I'm addicted to it. Once you get this app you can't put it down!! I recommend this app to everyone!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  Strategy is essential but it changes a bit for every game.  Unfortunately, it is also additictive!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Before I read the Percy Jackson series I was like, \\"Rick Rior-who?\\". Now he's my favorite author! If you love Percy Jackson and Greek mythology you should read this! At the end of \\" The Last Olympian\\" they mention the prophecy that you will learn more about in this book. Read this book immediately! Don't have second thoughts. Rick Riordan is a genius!!<br />  This book has great, heroic, smart, and funny characters. Like, my personal favorite Leo Valdez. He's so funny! He reminds me of Percy Jackson sometimes. Just he's a lot more outspoken than Percy. A LOT! Jason Grade is pretty cool too. I mean it's pretty awesome that he can control the sky, just like his dad,Zeus. I recommend this book to every Percy Jackson lover out there!!<br />  * Please note that there are some connections to Percy Jackson and you might want to read that book first*
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|I was expecting worse based on some feedback from friends. I enjoyed it and had a few laughs. I recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|First off I waited for it to download them I clicked on it cuz it was done so I did that then it shut the game off and I kept trying to open it and then it wouldn't stop so then I eventually deleted it don't try this app is a time waister!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good storyline. Enjoyed every episode. Kept me hooked all the way through the season. Would recompense to any one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time they offered this game for the kindle!! Love it!!! Needs a little work with gifts your friends send you, don't always get them.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Just as good as season 1. Great final episode of season. Can't wait for season 3.  Would recommend to anyone.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|The game is fun with great graphics. The a highly strong story line but the puzzles are fun and not too difficult. Didn't experience any glitches with my Kindle Fire HD.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I like how the 3 lived intertwined. A well thought out plot, believable responses, characters you come to like and families that come to life through her storytelling.  I enjoyed the ride
B0009SUS4Q|5.0|I was happy to watch Peter Pan again as an adult. What a great movie to show your friends and family.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Similar to the original Judge Dredd, If you're up for a shoot em up movie with little plot, this is a good choice.  If not, look elsewhere
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|challenging and fun...just wish we got more than 5 lives to play because it is very addicting...so now I play not only on my Kindle but on FB
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I think it is a really good game to play it has good video and good sound I like it when it is a free game ...
B005M0R4X4|5.0|DVD is brand new, plays perfect. Arrived quickly.  Very good price for getting this as fast as it was shipped.  The whole series is one of my favorites.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The story is an uplifting one, and the characters are good.  What could have been sappy and preachy is positive and well-played.  Read it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book with happy ending. Could read series again and again! Couldn't put the book down! Can't wait for the movie!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven was a well written account of Dr. Alexander's near death experience with a great medical perspective.  However, the medical perspective is a little difficult to understand for the average person, especially toward the end of the book.<br />I appreciated his ability to describe multi-demensional experiences with 3 demensional languague. His descriptions encourage the reader to from her own options about what he describes so his book is not from a religious point of view.<br /><br />Great read for those searching for the truth.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|It was ok. I just never really got that interested in the characters. The emotion was lacking, and not enough suspense.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Awesome possum! This rocks the cat's llama, for sures and for real. Give me all the Spock possible. Like, totes McGoats!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, fun and challenging game. Once you start playing you won't want to put it down. Try it you'll like it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A good read as usual for this talented author.  I think his bringing in the concept of multiverse and consciousness is fascinating and as he himself noted in his own remarks at the end of the story, not at all inconsistent with quantum physics. If correct we are all in for a very, very long ride with death(s) as mere way stations along the way!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is very good.  It accurately predicts the weather and makes planning my family's week a while lot easier.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great time killing game!!!!! LOVE playing this have after a long day at work.....it's relaxing to play in the comfy of my home without the bingo hall distractions!!! Thumbs up!!!!

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you're a Star Trek fan then you'll love it.  Not much more to say than that.  Check it out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game that keeps my son's attention at times when I really need it. The game is very simple and easy for my 3 year old to understand. He can play this for a little while and feel just as big as other kids.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I missed this movie in the theater so we decided to rent it one night.  Not your typical McConaughey movie.  It was very entertaining.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|I just downloaded this a couple days ago. I haven't stopped listening to since. Hope's voice is silky and sultry as ever, with David's guitar being the perfect accompaniment. As I'm hearing it now, my mind is taken deep into the woods around a campfire on a chilly autumn night. Perfect for this time of year. Also great for driving down a lonely back road. Beautiful and haunting, this is the album I've been waiting years for. Though I agree with some of the other reviews that there isn't a stand out single, it's not needed. This album should be listened to as a whole. Has their sound changed over the years? Not really, but that's what I love. I've already recommended this to all my friends. And I do so to you right now. Buy this album as soon as you get the chance. But only if you love that dreamy, morphine, alternative-country sound. I know this album isn't going to be for everyone, but just a few. And that's fine. I give this 5 out of 5 stars.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The device works pretty good with excellent video and sound quality. Sadly Google choose to cripple their own brain child! If you want to watch a video you made yourself, it's a No-Go. Listening to music you put on your phone directly (side loaded) it's a No-Go. Why? Because Google choose to remove the ability to use local media!! Why?? Because they can. There is really no other reason. Copyright?? Nope! A Google rep says it was an oversight, but after several more updates there is no fix for the issue. What a shame! If I hook up my hdmi cable, everything works. Come on Google, do the right thing and fix it already!
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|Having recently met students from Yemen,  I  enjoyed the movie.  Seeing the country , on film,  was a bonus.  Sitting at home and watching was fun.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I thought I was crazy, until I read this book. Welcome to the lunatic fringe, where creativity begins. An excellent book.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|WTH was that I been waiting anxiously for this book just to have the worst ending possible. I'm so disappointed that I been waiting just to see one an amazing series ruined. I had fate on Veronica Roth to end this in a satisfactory way but I guess is her story to tell not mine. To the fans be ready to cry your eyes out. To the author you are an excellent writer but next time gives us a warning.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited so long for this game to come to the kindle, and now I can play on my tablet. yay so happy.<br />Anyone just starting the game, play it but beware you will become addicted and you may need rehab after.

B00005JL78|4.0|even if you are not into Sci-Fi I think there is something for everybody, and the advanced technology is great as well, futurist helped to bring all of their ideals into a real world vision on screen !
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Though skeptical of reading this book in the beginning because dog all the &#34;hype&#34; it got, I didn't want to follow the herd but I fell prey as Ana did to Grey, I am beyond grateful that I did read it. This book evoked so many emotions from me as a reader! I was sitting further and further on the edge of my seat with every turn of the page! What a gut-wrenching yet emotional book. Great read!!!
1401938906|5.0|I found the experiments very easy to do.  Pam's prose is very insightful and humorous.  I enjoyed this reminder that we are all energy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish I would have never even started this series. I have canceld all of my pre orders by this autho and will never buy anything from her again.  There was no need for the senseless death.  It did not add to the story, it, in fact, took away from it.
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Hero in the comics ever! I read the comic book when I was a kid and Love the movies!!! Stan Lee is the greatest!

B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I like it but its a little weard but I still like it a little j would get this app
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this app for the longest time. So addicting fun love to play candy crush all the time.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I'm really, really enjoying this, love the actors,story and era. I'm alwaya loving this genre, it's not Downtown Abbey, but very good and very sweet. A feel good homestyle series. Loses some of it's goodness as goes along but still personally loved it.
B007Z9QTVI|4.0|Finding Forrester is a movie that is hard to categorize. I would say most of all it is about human relation ship and how an open mind to the unexpected can open the heart. Agoraphobic writer Forrester had locked himself up in his apartment and basically given up on life when he meets young James Wallace, to whom he can teach a lot but from whom he picks up a new lease on life, to the point that he wants to go back to his native Scotland to die. He then relates how this was the happiest period of his life, his Sunset, which is also the title of his second and final novel he leaves on his desk, unpublished, waiting for James to write a preface.<br /><br />It is also about hope in the face of seemingly unsurmountable odds, as James, a black from the Bronx destined for crime and a life in the streets, can use his intelligence, his basketball skills and not a little luck to make a real life for himself.<br /><br />The movie also says a lot about life in the Bronx (though things have improved there since) and about how elite American schools are ready to close an eye on academic performance to attract athletic talent in their recruitment process.<br /><br />This is the next to last appearance of Connery in a film before his retirement.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Certainly better-looking, with larger buttons, probably because not all functions are visible at the same time.  The ability to view what you've already done is nice too.  At the end of the day, it's just a calculator, but decent.
B0040I09RM|5.0|awesome show. I highly recommended. I had not seen any of it until now and realized there is something like 6 or 7 seasons. yeah!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I almost feel that by writing this review I'm a member of the Circle, but despite that feeling, I will continue.  The book seems to be a mirror of the not-too-distant future, where we can no longer slink back into the shadows and disappear.  The recent knowledge that government bureaus are tapping into the Internet and into our phone lines indicates that Eggers is more right than wrong. Today I just read of the case were the FBI wanted to get into an encrypted mail service (probably because Snowden had used it).  The inventor/owner didn't want to allow access, but the government required him to, but at the same time did not allow him to tell the public what was happening--a very Catch-22 situation).  Although as a researcher, I very much appreciate how much information is available on the Internet, I wonder like some of the folks in the book, that perhaps too much information (much of which is unvarified) is also there.  I also found that the rise of Mae seemed to be unsupported. Yes, she had friends in high places, but Eggers portrayed her as being the smartest one in the crowd. I would have thought that Ty would have had more control over his &#34;baby&#34; than what Eggers showed.  Unfortunately, there are folks like the other two of the three executives.  Google's motto &#34;Do no evil&#34; (even thought their membership in ALEC is questionable) should have been the motto of the Circle, but unfortunately it wasn't and Mae became too delusional to see that.  I hope the ending of world does not follow that of the Circle

B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an excellent series!  The characters are very interesting and the topic is current. Can't wait to watch season 2.
B008JFUR10|2.0|Boy was I fooled.  This is just one more of the countless Japanese Godzilla movies, complete with Japanese city destruction, Karate nonsense if you can believe this, and a plethora of unknown actors.  Of course, Amazon overpriced it by $2.00 from retail selling price so they won't let you sell this junk used to try and get some of your money back.  If they would, mine would be listed.  The special effects are good.  But, so what.  They are all good in modern science fiction movies.  The actors all act stupid considering the impact and emergency of the danger.  The story has a comical approach to pretty much the end of the world so you will never take any of the story line seriously.  This is one big super special effects waste of time.  If you must see it, do yourself a favor and rent it for a dollar.
1400052181|4.0|Captivating look at the original tissue donor of a well-known cell culture line and her suviving relatives.  The author examines the issues behind tissue donation from multiple angles.
1451626088|4.0|I just finished The Kingmaker's Daughter and I'm all caught up on Philippa Gregory's The Cousin's War series now. The gist of this one is that the Earl of Warwick was completely ruthless and his hapless daughters Anne and Isabel merely disposable pawns in his insane quest for power. And for all his ferocity Warwick still comes across as a charmer compared to his icicle Countess wife.<br /><br />While I don't necessarily agree with all of Gregory's conclusions -- Richard III totally killed those boys -- you have to admire her story telling technique.<br /><br />Viewing the same series of events through the eyes of five different women is a brilliant concept emphasizing just how subjective reality is. The only common thread is the precarious status of women and children in a male dominated culture riven by war.<br /><br />Everyone takes turn being victimized or benefitting from somebody else getting put through the wringer. It's like that notorious pep talk from Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross: \\"First prize is a Cadillac El Dorado. Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired.\\"<br /><br />Except that in 15th century England losers generally ended up dead. Emphatically so. I can't say that I'm looking forward to The Last Rose, the final novel in the sextet featuring poor, doomed Margaret Pole. Not what you'd call a happy ending.

B009LDCZ7I|4.0|The relationship between Carrie and Brody continue to push the limits of believability but aside from that, it's a great spy story in the tradition of 24.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book didn't require that you have read The Shining to catch on to the story. And, it didn't slam your face into retelling the story synopsis from the first book like some sequel do.<br /><br />Thecarry over of a traumatized, telepathic 5-year-old becoming an alcoholic adult to cope with his 'visions' was perfectly reasonable. Showing Dan[ny] hit bottom and regain his sobriety made this more than just a horror novel.<br /><br />King has been totally on his game. This is a great read.

B000025XKM|5.0|I saw the VW commercial on TV and was totally entranced by Pink Moon.  I had  to Google VW commercials to find out who was performing that wonderful song and I found it was Nick Drake's Pink Moon.  Please research this troubled, sad, very special man who died so very young and his music will be all the sweeter and more wonderful to your ears.  Recording his music was a slow painstaking process as this delicate, depressed person needed much encouragement and time to record by people willing to be patient and bless them for being so....  Drake thought himself a failure as a musician and never knew how really wonderful his music is to those of us who love his music now...way too late
B0027YUK98|5.0|This is not the typical pretty, genteel performance of these wonderful sonatas. The performance is quite aggressive, but absolutely fascinating. Listen to Melnikov's finger work - incredible. Faust uses almost no vibrato, so no sugar here, but she is able to seamlessly alternate between the role of soloist and accompanist. If you want a different perspective on these works, do buy this splendid set - you won't regret it.<br /><br />The MP3 download is seriously flawed. The tracks are inadequately labeled and, even worse, some tracks are out of sequence. Do not buy the MP3s unless you are prepared to spend a couple of hours relabeling and re-sequencing the MP3 files.
B0036TGT2A|1.0|Disney has disgracefully released the 2013 The Little Mermaid Blu-Ray discs and DVDs with faulty prints. The edit has been altered when you first see Scuttle, this isn't such a big deal, however, during Part of Your World two shots have been reversed and cause a lip-sync problem. The fact that Disney have released this film, one that is so important to the history of the company and is such a favourite among fans is completely unacceptable.<br />Disney have now started dealing with the issue, I contacted them about the problem and they got back to me, here is part of the email;<br />Thank you for your e-mail regarding The Little Mermaid.<br />We are aware of the issue and are able to resolve it with a different copy of the disc. In order to receive a replacement disc, please respond to our e-mail answering the following questions... (I have omitted the next section, the email continues)<br />A replacement is not available for your 3D disc. (completely unacceptable!)<br />Once we receive this information, we will send out a postage paid return mail label. Please use this label to send us your Blu-ray and DVD discs, and keep all original packaging.

Hopefully the replacements won't also be faulty.

These tags are standard compliant which means any NFC device should be able to read them, unlike the other non-compliant tags that newer android devices can not read.<br /><br />There are free apps on the Google Play store (like Tagstand Writer) that will allow you to program these tag to trigger actions like connecting to bluetooth and playing music, or setting volume levels, etc.<br /><br />The tags are adhesive so you can stick them on anything.  I have one on my night stand that set volume levels and starts a white noise program.
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|What do people do nowadays when they're having trouble with a house?  Well, they pack up their stuff, move out, and drop off the keys at the bank of course.  And stop paying their mortgages.  Well, that's at least what people did during the housing downturn in the mid-late 2000s.  If it was OK to do it then, why wasn't it OK in the early 1970s?<br /><br />I've seen the Warrens on quite a few television shows over the years, and I always found them interesting.  I believe that they were on &#34;The Haunted,&#34; which wasn't too bad of a show.  Sure, I didn't always believe the stories -- or the people on the show itself -- but who cares?  It was always interesting to watch other people go through hell while I could just sit back, eat popcorn, and watch.<br /><br />Which leads me to an interesting review that I partially read the other day about this film.  In that review, someone said that he didn't like this film because it &#34;wasn't real.&#34;  He used different words than that but I can't repeat them on a family site.  Now, if I were to use his logic, I could make the same claims about movies such as &#34;Superman.&#34;  &#34;Superman doesn't exist and therefore you shouldn't watch the film because it's garbage.  And you'd be stupid as well,&#34; might be my argument.  Well, why do you exactly have to believe in anything to like it, anyways?  Naturally, you don't.  Which is why that review was ridiculous.<br /><br />What isn't exactly ridiculous:  &#34;The Conjuring&#34; itself.  I got a few good frights out of it, and I had a few jump-out-of-my-seat moments, which is really all you should expect from a horror film, isn't it?  Why is &#34;real&#34; any good anyways?  The last housing downturn was certainly &#34;real,&#34; but I surely wouldn't call it very much fun or entertaining.  But more than that, I've always been a fan of Vera Farmiga, and I thought that she did a great job of channeling Loraine Warren here, even though I believe that Ms. Warren is stillalive.<br /><br />Well, back to the original question, or at least the implication from it:  why didn't this family just pack up, move out, and drop the keys at the bank here instead of sticking it out with evil demons?  Well, back in the 70s, there was something called &#34;personal responsibility.&#34;  And that's something that I wish would come back, unlike the nasty ghosts in this film.  Unless there is the rumored sequel, of course.
B00CTMA95S|5.0|Smash, bang, boom. As usual, one cliffhanger after another.  Rollins is more fun than watching a horse race.  It's odds on who's going to win, but you go along for the adrenaline rush.  Sigma Force books are more whydunnits or howdunnits than genuine puzzles.

B000002BE9|5.0|Its hard to believe a wafer-thin eighteen year old girl with no prior record deal would hit the ball out the park right with her debut but that is exactly what happened with “Tidal”, young Fiona Apple’s debut record; and till today possibly her finest. Despite belonging to the nineties, the album sounds timeless, the production sparkles, there is absolutely no filler, & it harkens back to the day when albums were real albums – as in a cohesive piece of work where one song flows into the next without pandering to the audience in the fashion that today’s singles-ridden record industry seems oft to do.<br /><br />“Tidal” is exceptional for many reasons, and is perhaps the greatest debut by a female singer-songwriter in record history. The closest parallel that can be drawn is with Tori Amos’ debut record “Little Earthquakes” (although Toriphiles would argue that Tori’s actual first album was by her now defunct band Y Kant Tori Read). Nothing else comes remotely close. This album is immediately arresting due to its decision to put Apple’s jazz-influenced husky voice up front and center, rather than drowning it down with instrumentation. Considering the time period it came from, this is remarkable (try listening to some of those Sophie B. Hawkins & Heather Nova albums and you’ll know exactly what I mean).<br /><br />Even more interesting, the best songs on this piece of art are the ones that were not singles. “Criminal”, for which it is best known, is a grand statement even all these years later, but check out the subdued production of “Carrion”, and also the subtle flourishes in “Pale September”. They work as the album closers but they are exceptional & possibly the best things on the record, followed quite obviously by “The First Taste”, which is still haunting in this day and age; the lyrics are something Fiona herself has been unable to surpass, despite of course their tendency to veer into dramatics & over the top imagery. That though is part of the magic, and I for one embrace Apple’s attempts at poetic genius rather than deride them.<br /><br />Fiona’s next album “When the Pawn” was equally grandiose, albeit with more of an alternative rock edge, and her later albums “Extraordinary Machine”, and 2012’s “The Idler Wheel” are all naturally fantastic, but there is *something* about “Tidal” that is unforgettable. Definitely a desert island disc in my opinion, and one that every serious record collector should own properly on CD or vinyl. On a side note the production values on this disc are nothing short of overwhelmingly good. “Tidal” is on my Top 10 list of the Greatest Albums of All Time, a list that also contains Tori Amos’ “Scarlet’s Walk”, Joanna Newsom’s “Ys”, & Cocorosie’s “Gray Oceans”. If any or all of those albums appeal to you, you might want to check out this record.<br /><br />Indispensable. Five Stars.hat though is part of the magic, and I for one embrace Apple’s attempts at poetic genius rather than deride them.<br /><br />Fiona’s next album “When the Pawn” was equally grandiose, albeit with more of an alternative rock edge, and her later albums “Extraordinary Machine”, and 2012’s “The Idler Wheel” are all naturally fantastic, but there is *something* about “Tidal” that is unforgettable.

B00FLDG52I|5.0|While I obviously haven't seen the video yet, I did see the theater release during the summer.  This year's benefit is as good as the 3 previous shows, with some highlights that, to me, were pure gold.  John Mayer and Keith Urban doing a &#34;Don't Bring Me Down&#34; was very high on my list and a short acoustic set with Greg Allman, Warren Haynes, and Derek Trucks was absolutely fantastic.  The typical guitar-heavy, star studded offerings did not disappoint in any way, except in the absence of any footage (in the theater release) of B. B King.  I can only assume his age is a factor there.  I'm pre-ordering the DVD and the CD (wonderful addition to the available formats) and will be counting the days until they arrive.

B0020TS5LU|1.0|[THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY COPY]<br />Let's get it out of the way. The film itself is amazing! The problem is the product. While the DVD jampacks itself with excellent extras the Blu-ray version took everything out--including the subtitles. Yes. I'm serious. With the only option on the \\"main menu\\" is to switch audio from DTS to Dolby 5.1, this version of an amazing film is just disappointing. The transfer isn't clean as well. Everything seems to be done with a grotesque laziness that it completely mirrors the masterfully orchestrated whodunit Oscar winner. Sadly, you're better off with the DVD copy. I'm kicking myself for losing mine. :(

006202406X|4.0|While still an engaging read, the final book in this epic trilogy lacked the finesse, style and edge of your seat feel of Roth's previous books in the series. The book gives interesting background on the city, the history of the factions and the history of Tris's family but the plot develops rather slowly.  I found myself waiting around for the plot climax and being slightly dissapointed when it finally came.  Overall it was a good read and  great end to the series, but ranks as my least favorite book in the trilogy.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is my first Neil Gaiman read. Who is this guy and where does he come up with these ideas?<br /><br />I rarely read books with magical elements. But very few pages into this book, I was hooked. Gaiman made me believe in events with no connection to reality. Ands while they were not blatantly frightening in a horror-story kind of way, after I finished the book I did have some nightmares. Was it because he evoked fears we all had as children?<br /><br />I'm simply in awe of a mind that can create this kind of story. Like nothing else I've ever read.

0316204366|2.0|I was really excited to read this book and found it very disappointing, for reasons best summed up in a direct quote Malcolm Gladwell gave the Telegraph:<br /><br />\\"I've realised there are certain things that writers and critics prize, and readers don't. So we're obsessed with things like coherence, consistency, neatness of argument. Readers are indifferent to those things. My books have contradictions, all the time - and people are fine with that.\\"

B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I enjoyed this well written sequel to Beyond Bridalveil Fall. It was interesting to learn the details about Oria, the Golden Queen's, mysterious disappearance. I was happy that Oria was reunited with the family she had not seen for almost eighteen years - her mother, father, and her almost sister. Oria traveled to the land of the lost to save the displaced souls who were waiting to travel to their final home in the west. Just like when I read the first book in the series, I learned a lot about Native American culture, shape shifters, and spirits. Beyond Oria Falls is another interesting book that I highly recommend to anyone who loves reading about Native Americans with a touch of fantasy and paranormal mixed in.
B00400NHRO|1.0|If there was a way to give this book back I would.  Too much sexual references and I couldn't read very much
1401223176|4.0|I just couldn't put it down... every chapter ended with a cliff-hanger that begged me to continue on... This isn't the best Batman book I've read ('The Killing Joke' is hard to beat), but in terms of a detective story, I couldn't ask for anything more. The story centers around a plot by an unknown villain to kill Batman. Batman seems more vulnerable, confused and frustrated than in other story arcs. He starts questioning everything that's going on around him as he tries to figure out who the mysterious figure is. With other Heroes (Superman, Nightwing) and Villains (Catwoman, Harley Quinn) joining the story as well as numerous surprise appearances, this book is a page-turner you'll be glad you picked up. The illustrations alone are reason enough to grab this book... Jeph Loeb & Jim Lee's Batman is simply bad-ass.
1451695195|4.0|I got this book for my husband, which he lost his grandma last year and his long time favorite cousin 10+ years ago. Everyday after he read it, he gave me a hug by thanking me to get this book for him. He said it's really sincere and real of how the author has written in the book about his experience. My husband is very faithful and firm of what he's been believing in. And reading this book offering him a very comforting feeling of knowing his beloved families are now happy and safe and peaceful living in another much more real world.

I love how their seasons aren't ongoing so even though I started with Season 3 there was no back story or plot that I missed. While the show is completely far-fetched its extremely well-written and addictive! Must watch!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love watching this show, it's so nostalgically escapist.  Seeing how the 0.01% of the most powerful empire on the planet at that time lived.  Just a hint of the misery that the majority of British lived in.  There's an earl in my family tree, but I'd rather be a middle class American now than any of the Downton characters then. Still, lovely show!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Only owned this for about a month and then the controller began to register random buttons being hit during game play.  While using the left joystick, buttons on the d-pad would frequently register being hit.  Had another person use it to make sure it wasn't me and they said the same thing.  I'm stuck with a $50 broken controller as I missed Amazon's 1 month return policy.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I'm using this calculator on an Android cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S3), not a tablet. This calculator has many more features than the standard calculator installed on the phone. You can see what your last calculation was. It has a memory feature, like handheld calculators do.

There are probably more neat things that it does, but I've only had it for a couple of days and can't speak to them.

1623650003|5.0|I had seen a few mentions of Alex by Pierre Lemaitre around the blogosphere and thought it might be a good fit, given my penchant for crime thrillers.<br /><br /> Was it ever! I was hooked from the first chapter. (And more than a little annoyed at myself that I didn't start reading earlier in the night) Fair warning right from the start - Gentle readers this one's not for you - there is graphic violence and disturbing situations.) Back to that first chapter.....a beautiful young woman named Alex is snatched off the street, taken to an abandoned warehouse and forced into a small wooden crate which is then suspended from the ceiling. Her captor says nothing more to her other than he is going to watch her die. But Alex is resourceful....very resourceful...<br /><br /> A kidnapping is reported and the case is given to Commandant Camille Verhoeven - a man who lost his pregnant wife to a kidnapper - her body was found, but not the perpetrator and he has eschewed all kidnapping cases since.  Verhoeven's boss LeGuen assigns him to the case as he says there is no one else and so Verhoeven reluctantly takes on the case. LeGuen has brought Verhoeven's old team back together. Lemaitre has created a memorable group of investigators that I really enjoyed. But the most memorable is of course Verhoeven.<br /><br /> \\"People rarely get the measure of Camille on first meeting and rarely appreciate him. This might also be because he's not exactly cheerful. Camille doesn't like himself very much.\\" Camille is also a victim of fetal hypotrophy and stands only 4'11'. \\"Camille is positively stunted. He sees the world from the viewpoint of a thirteen year old.\\" In contrast, his superior and old friend LeGuen is quite large - the scale is somewhere near three hundred pounds. Armand and Louis fill out the team. Again opposites -  Louise is wealthy with no need to work and Armand is a notorious penny pincher. (His scavenging ways provided a light note in a heavy plot)<br /><br /> And what a plot! Lemaitre is fiendishly clever, leading the reader down one path initially and then veering off in a direction I didn't see coming. I really don't want to give much more away - I love being surprised and Lemaitre successfully caught me unawares. Loved it!<br /><br /> I have to also mention that Frank Wynne did a fantastic job with the translation - very smooth reading with no wooden clunky sentences or form.<br /><br /> Alex is an excellent thriller and a great introduction to a prickly character I want to see more of. Alex was the winner of the CWA International Dagger Award 2013.t! Lemaitre is fiendishly clever, leading the reader down one path initially and then veering off in a direction I didn't see coming. I really don't want to give much more away - I love being surprised and Lemaitre successfully caught me unawares. Loved it!<br /><br /> I have to also mention that Frank Wynne did a fantastic job with the translation - very smooth reading with no wooden clunky sentences or form.<br /><br /> Alex is an excellent thriller and a great introduction to a prickly character I want to see more of. Alex was the winner of the CWA International Dagger Award 2013.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|I automatically buy Pink Martini albums and not great at reviewing things from a music point of view.  Bought the cd mostly on its title which I needed:  Get Happy.  Love the song selection.  However, I love the packaging!  The &#34;polaroid shots&#34; are awesome.
1451673442|5.0|It was so much more than I expected.  I have recommended it to family members and a lot of my peers whom I work out with in the gym.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I know you can pretty much do anything in the editing room, but even knowing that, the tricks were great. Just the way the movie flowed was compelling and held your attention right from the start.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Genius directing and writing.  The best actors around.  Original stories that can not be equaled.  This is the epitome of suspense, and sometimes horror.
B008Y5N3O8|3.0|Plot ok, great character acting and some classic lines put down by Lemon and Baldwin.  Worth a watch if you like the actors.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I will be returning this item; the audio goes very low throughout the video; had to watch with the remote in my hand to raise and lower the volume!
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Excellent detail and knowledge of 'need to know' information. ;) Fast paced and full of action -- some great twists and turns with a good ending. Most enjoyable!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual, Stephen King's talent &#34;shines&#34; in this sequel to The Shining, which is one of my favorite books. Everyone has something in their past that they wish could be erased, and as Dan Torrance learned, owning it is the only way to do that. So many interesting characters in this story. Now I want to see what the future holds for Abra. Read The Shining first.
B006RBZV82|5.0|Nice 40min flick w/ the kids before bed. Narration by Kate Winslet & Johnny Depp is also kind of fun.
B00FPGV3RS|5.0|My wife and I can't stop laughing at this movie.  We would recommend this movie when ever you just need to have a good time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game it is so addicting. Glad I can now use my Kindle to play. Makes game more fun.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Game itself is good...not to easy,but the ads that pop up after every game are annoying and you end up hitting wrong area on screen and being redirected there...well it is free.
1476727651|4.0|Glad the old Stephen King story telling is back!  It can't beat The Shining, but for a sequel it's pretty good.

B000XR4OC0|1.0|I'm 35 weeks pregnant and was in need of new shoes since my feet are swollen all the time so I decided to order TOMS. I already have a pair in navy but needed a size bigger so I decided to order from amazon. I'm so disappointed in amazon for working with sellers like Jay's Board Co.<br />They shipped a dirty old used pair of shoes when I clearly ordered a brand new pair of shoes. The bottom of the shoes are filthy dirty and black marks everywhere. There's stains on the canvas part of the shoes too. I'm obviously going to return them today. But it's just annoying that I have to go through the trouble of returning these because the seller are a bunch of lying crooks! shame on you!<br />Please DO NOT order from these crooks!!!!<br /><br />check out these link for pictures if you're interested<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Fantastic show. Interesting plot lines, exciting action sequences, and genuine moments from the actors. One of the best shows on TV right now.
B00FPH6M82|5.0|Good drama, good action.  Liked it.  Visually appealing.  Very military; I can relate.  Rented through Amazon.com through my LG television.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show! I love the period pieces and that it is great acting.<br />Bring on the next season. Love it!
B00EPFEY44|5.0|This album is very Beautiful  Oh how I love this guy.  I was not disappointed and I don't think you will be either.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Practically every sentence is so skillfully constructed, the reader feels he is reading poetry---given a beautiful picture to place you in time and place.  Suspenseful and touching.  A masterpiece!
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I'm sorry to say this but this movie sucks.come on will smith,really?I know you want to show off your son to the world but you could of done a better job.maybe its just me that thinks your son son is not a good actor but please don't keep doing this to him. I actually got this movie as a gift and I wish I could give it back,I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this movie. I still love will smith though:-)
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Action fans this is your cup of tea, you won't be disappointed. Easy to read and very enjoyable ! !
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|The Conjuring is one of the better ghost stories we have seen in the last decade or so. James Wan honed in on elements like the dark, shadows, and sound to play off fear from the audience. What also helped was the cinematography and the great camera work that made some scenes even more intense. There was much focus on the characters; especially the Warrens as they became the focus of the movie and how their ordeals in the past would resurrect again.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie even after seeing the movie a second time the scares can come off as comical but are still effective for enjoyment purposes. Some may say that too much is revealed in terms of what the unknown entity may be and becomes less interesting as the film progresses. I would argue not and say the story was balanced and kept my attention all the way through. Own this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Honestly, I liked the book only because I am a King fan.  I have very eclectic reading interests from Kingsolver to Dickens, but I will never pass up a Stephen King novel. King is entertaining,  I love his &#34;good vs. evil&#34; ongoing theme, his subtle politics and I enjoy how he references his own material so that if you are a fan and &#34;constant reader&#34; you know exactly to what he is referring.  If you like King, you will probably enjoy this book, however ,if this is your first or second read of King, it may be a disappointment in the &#34;scare department&#34;
1476727651|5.0|My husband is so excited for this book.  He can't wait to finish it.  Stephen King can still put out great books
B004L49K20|4.0|Overall, I like this album and do not regret buying it.  It's apparent that the band cared about making a quality album that they hoped their fans would appreciate.  The Classic Albums-style DVD that is packaged with the album is awesome, and it would be so cool if all new albums came out with something along these lines.  The fact that they commissioned an artist they appreciate to do a bunch of artwork for the packaging shows that they were paying attention to all the details.  Their choice of Mark Ronson as a producer was a wise move in trying to make themselves sound current while simultaneously revisiting their classic sound.  Paradoxically, herein lies the primary reason for giving the album four stars instead of five.<br />I am almost as much a fan of Mark Ronson's albums released under his own name as I am of Duran Duran's stuff.  What I enjoy about the music he creates/produces is that he has a very hip approach to combining genres as well as new- and old-school sounds.  So when Duran Duran decided that they wanted to revisit the feel that they had on their classic eighties albums while also sounding current, Mark Ronson was clearly an appropriate choice to produce.  Unfortunately, some of his production choices may have weakened the album a bit, especially the flagrant use of auto-tune on Simon Le Bon's vocals, which we know from all their classic works is totally unnecessary.<br />It seems to be a trend for aging bands to go back to their earlier sound in order to get fans who stopped buying recent albums to come back around.  One prime example that comes to mind is Metallica's album Death Magnetic.  That album, almost song for song, sounded like slight variations of songs on their first four albums--so much so that I removed the album from my iPod entirely because I figured I might as well just listen to the classics and not inferior knockoffs.<br />Fortunately, although many involved in making All You Need Is Now specifically mention attempts to emulateearlier songs on the accompanying DVD, the songs on this album do sound original enough that they merit repeated listening.  It seems the challenge of putting out an album like this is that reviewers like me are--like it or not--effectively comparing it to their greatest hits collection, which it is only fair to acknowledge is a compilation of the cream of the crop from eight or so albums.  So if this album contains a handful of five-star songs, in the end, it's hard to complain.  It will take more time for me to determine which songs I would put on the level of the ones I enjoy from their various greatest hits collections, but hopefully some of the tunes will end up being just as classic; while, as on their earlier albums, some will be likely to fall by the wayside.  I can already say that \\"Being Followed\\" is an instant classic.<br />I want to close on a positive note by mentioning that I find the title of the album and the message implied by it to be valuable and relevant not only to the current reality of the band, but to all of our lives.  That phrase can be used as a mantra if you find yourself brooding over something from the past.  Why not focus on the present and stay optimistic?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As after the first book, I  can't wait for the next one! Oh wait...Kindle - don't have to wait! :)
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Good old action with a few twists and turns, readers will be hard out trying to figure out who the mole is!
B00FPH6A70|4.0|Did't like that u had to buy the movie.......But was a good movie. Had me keep guessing through the movie...
B000FBJAF0|5.0|One of the best, most riveting books I've read in awhile!  Couldn't put it down!  I had to go on line to find other books by Frederick Forsyth!
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Such a cute and creative movie! I watched this for family movie night and I'm a pretty big movie critique but totally loved this movie!!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|kinda long, but inspiring. it's good to see when good triumphs, despite all the chaos that may go on around us.
B005544V6A|5.0|I can't stop saying lines from this show. I am addicted to Harvey, Ross and the gang. It always helps that they are gorgeous to look at.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Easy to use. I use Google and Yahoo as my primary search engines and like them both but Google seems to deliver more accurate results.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|it was good, not as this great you have to read book that everyone portrayed it to be...but not bad, looking forward.to movie.
0788859544|5.0|Bought this for my two year old because she loves Ariel. She flipped the first time I played the DVD. It was awesome. Package arrived very fast and was in great shape and lived up to all expectations
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Finding Nemo is the best. Who doesn't love finding nemo?? My son loves this movie, i love this movie and my husband loves this movie. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game! It's challenging without being so difficult that it's frustrating. I would recommend it for a good brain work out!
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Zombies?  Evil Spirits?  Snappy One-Liners?  Occasional Side-Boob?  This movie's got 'em all, in Sam Raimi's trademark directorial style.  Halloween or any time, this movie is the pinnacle of campy horror fun.  Bruce Campbell hits the height of his cult-film character as Ash, the once-hapless victim of demons and zombies turned Dirty Harry of the undead. There's more to tell, of course, but this movie is best summed up in one word:  &#34;Groovy.&#34;
B009A87X80|1.0|A pretty voice & talented musicians, but you can't listen to this CD without keeping one hand on the volume control & another on the equalizer. I imagine it was recorded with 1 microphone- someone held it up, down, left, right, wherever they wanted. Sometimes you can barely hear the accompaniment, sometimes you barely hear the voice. It's a sound engineering disaster. Listened once & I'm done. This CD belongs in the bargain box.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Gave you a good background on the Orphan train orphans and effectively contrasted it with an orphan and her problems and conflicts in today's society.  I enjoyed the book.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This season is a great ride,brother! Love all the twists. Who requires a certain amount of words for a review.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a well written book, the writer allows you to get into the mind of the characters in a way that keeps you reading.  Never lost interest in this book and went on to read another of her books which was also excellent.  So if you want a good read, this author is for you....
B00499NHLC|5.0|I find it very enjoyable. It is fast  and has quite abit of humor in it. I would love to know when the new season starts.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I was not familiar with Tesla or his inventions so I am happy that I chose to read this and to further my knowledge about him on the internet. It's unfortunate that Tesla was a brilliant inventor, but a poor businessman. Money was only important to him to further his inventions; being wealthy was never his goal. It's also unfortunate how the wealthy men manipulated him for their own financial gains in spite of the mark this man and others like him could have made on our country and the world. Some things never change; even today the rich and powerful are destroying our country and its people for their own financial gains. \\"SE LA VIE.\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Top game real fun enjoyable game<br />Can't wait to get to all levels<br />A plus<br />Solid addition<br />Fun gameplay interesting
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This is a great book. It's an easy read that pulls you in from the beginning and keeps you  wanting to know what happens next.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have been a fan of STAR TREK  since the 60's. I have seen all the STAR TREK movies. (I have them all). It took me to the second movie to accept the new characters. I hope they make more!
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|found the different methods of searching interesting. I especially liked the option to search through fog. This game was nicely done.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Fits perfectly. I was skeptical about the elastic pull strap, but now I can't imagine not having it. It pops the phone out just enough. Quality look and build.<br /><br />Exactly what I was looking for.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This story was delightful. The main characters ,Mary, Dickon and Colin were a joy to get to know in this book; so much so that I would love for the author to continue their adventures in another book. This is a story that should be added to middle schools and high schools as recommended school break reading. It should be required reading for school bullies during detention with discussions after. Maybe it will help them to see the joy in friendships, fun, life and the magic of a vivid imagination.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I really wanted to like this game but it is very slow and unresponsive on my kindle fire hd. I found it very frustrating for this reason.
B00BZA7M5A|4.0|This movie has some hilarious scenes. The acting was good. Jennifer Aniston is a freak in this movie, big difference from her innocent image she portrays in her other work.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|IT WAS OK. PROBABLY A GOOD GAME IF YOU ARE BINGO FANATIC. I WILL PLAY IT AGAIN AFTER WAITING A FEW DAYS OR SO.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm sooooo excited this is now available on Amazon. I'm hooked &amp; look forward to playing every chance I get.
B008EL25LE|2.0|Too confusing for me. Not enough instructions.  Can not figure out the objective. Made it to level 3 then gave up.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|My granddaughter downloaded it to play on my Kindle.  Cute game and antic's.  No disappointed.  Very fun for kids to play.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It reminded me of &#34;The Hours&#34;, in that there were three stories intertwined. Whereas &#34;The Hours&#34; took place in three different time periods, this novel and the three stories takes place at the same time period and all the characters know each other directly or indirectly. I found the novel worthy of a vacation read.
B00846REIS|5.0|The story kept me interested and was fun to read.<br />A very good friend recommended this series so I started reading it.<br />I have since recommended it to some of my very good friends and we all agree definitely worth reading!
B0080K3CYI|4.0|Saw the movie some years back and scratched my head at the main character's choices.  Having read the book I think I understand a little better.  Couldn't put it down.
B004K8WPUQ|3.0|I'm happy with this mic however I'm very worried about the tiny line that goes from the back of the mic into the camera... it's very thin, it can cut or be pulled from the mic easily... Rode should work on protecting and making these wires stronger and stretchable...
B004TI5N38|3.0|Readable and enjoyable. Zero Day is well paced and scratches the thriller itch as well as any.  You will want to find out what happens next.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|item arrived on time and in excellent condition.DVD were in very good order and worked correctly.Ihave  no complaints regarding this item.Will use service again
B00E66QPCG|3.0|Basic System for black & white day trading. If only it was this easy to make money in the market. But then maybe it is if you follow the system to the letter.  Fun and easy read..
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|I am enjoying this show, but it is not nearly as good as SG-1.  I wanted SG-1 to keep on going after I finished it, so I started watching Atlantis.  It has some good stories, but it is taking a while to get into the characters.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|The movie was awesome! LOVED IT! This is what movies should be like! Old school action with a tough group to distribute the punishment! It has a retro 80s style to it! Just awesome! Can't wait for more!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  I try to do a few levels a day, but that doesn't seem to work because it's so addicting.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I've read the Outlander series over and over! Each read reveals something new or makes connections that I had previously missed. You fall in love with every character Diana Gabaldon creates. Diana Gabaldon writes like no one else! Do yourself a favor dive into the world of Jamie and Claire!
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Elton just keeps getting better with Age - this particular album gets even better with each playing.  It really grows on you. Hope there's a few more left in him yet!

B00C3UUZVE|4.0|My daughter played it a while and she liked it.<br />She likes all Dr. Panda games, I had to download many because it takes short time to play.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|The entire Trilogy was engrossing from jump street.  I read the trilogy based on my granddaughter's recommendation.  So what I'm saying is...young or old or inbetween...the trilogy is very entertaining!
B003QSOE0U|5.0|This movie is highly entertaining.  It has it's action parts, love parts, and sad parts.  Very enjoyable.  Can't<br />Really compare movie to what really took place because I wasn't born yet.
B000001F29|5.0|Just a great album, clearly the best by the duo, never tire of hearing this brilliant piece of work. Sensational.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you rally your brain cells to figure out how to get from one floor to the next.  It starts out simple, but gets tricky as you move up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for season 4!!! Every season gets better and better. Don't pick a favorite character. It's like Game of Thrones, someone may not make it to the next season.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Giant monsters and Robots.  That says it all.  A portal, deep within the ocean floor, tears open allowing giant monsters (Kaiju) to rampage the earth.  In an effort to protect mankind, humans create giant robots (jeagers) inorder to combat the monsters.  When the Jeager program is threatned Stacker Pentacost (Idris Elba) does everything in his power to keep it alive.  Reilegh (Hunman) and Mako (Kikuchi) end up working together not just to eliminate the Kaiju problem, but also help one another with their traumatic pasts.<br /><br />This movie is Del Toro's homage to the creators of the giant monster films.  He did not disappoint!  Sci fi fans, & fans of the big monster/robot flicks can appreciate this film.  The effects are incredible.  The big battles kept me at the edge of my seat.  This film (for the most part) moved at a steady pace. The story of the Kaiju creative.<br /><br />My only complaint is not from the film, but the blu ray packaging.  Instead of the DVDs having their own compartments, the blu rays were stacked up on eachother.  In other words: 3 discs & only two comapartments.  That's not cool.  Especially dealing with Blu rays.  Don't know what they were thinking, but someone needs their @$$ kicked for that.<br /><br />This film is totally worth owning.  If you go Blu ray, just be warned of the absurd packaging.
006202406X|1.0|This final book in the trilogy was VERY disappointing.  It really showed how young and inexperienced the author is.  The ending ruins the series and the author repeats herself throughout this book - same descriptions over and over - very boring. I enjoyed the first two books and was excited to read the final book.  I recommended this series to a ton of people - I will not recommend it again.  If you read the first two books, imagine your own ending and don't bother with this book.
0143116371|5.0|I loved looking at all these creative people. Authors' own comments made it better. The author had very keen eyes and find people that I can relate to. It's just great. This book feel like it's not about clothes, but about humans.
B003297I1U|5.0|Firstly, I give 5 star to Amazon.com that ship this item and the replacement faster than expected. I got a not proper aligned of a front wheel and Amazon.com replace me so fast. Just an hour after the complaint made-internationally shipped on the same day. Not giving any worth to their business I think.. due expensive DHL courrier cost, but for best customer satisfaction, they done it excellently. My kids love it very much and they have better sleeping night with that big toy stuff.<br /><br />The truck cabin has enough empty space to creatively put some electronics circuits for LEDs lighting or other attractive decoration. It done well with mine my kids too much excited triggering the LEDs button. Behind the cabin seats, there is look like a 'sleeping bed' space could be useful for further modification.<br />Overall, the crane pole/boom well built, high quality and sturdy. But 'cracking' sound heard when they twisting the knob for lowering the boom. It need a stronger kid's hand to work it out, not so easy to counter that knob. All the mechanism of rising or lowering the poles/boom and also the winching cable got latch mechanism buy the only worries is they always off-tracked the cable out of pulley (when adding the last boom part). My kids also got fighting over when the first unit came, but they enjoy playing all these mechanism simultaneously by their bare hand, together to think and educating themselves after all. Happy with this Bruder.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Wonderful characters, interesting plot. Can't wait to get the rest of the series.Some character expansion is need though, still likable but a little sketchy right now.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is a good game to play.  It is a very challenging game, that you never get tired of playing.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I loved the Shining. While this book is not on the caliber of the Shining, it definitely satisfied some gnawing curiosity inside me that I didn't know I had to find out whatever happened to that little boy after the Overlook Hotel went boom.<br />I appreciated that it was a manageable length, fast-paced, and not too gory. Overall enjoyable.
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|We love that we can watch this any time and my four year old just loves monsters. Sully and mike are the best
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love the characters and storyline. The dilemma between right and wrong the characters all face while also being torn between their inner choices.
0062127241|5.0|I have been a fan of The Who and Pete Townshend in particular for a long time. Townshend is one of the pre-eminent intellects in rock and roll, a clever, witty, well-spoken genius with more than a touch of neurosis. It is not surprising that his autobiography is a no-holds-barred, warts and all account of his life in and out of rock and roll. The book starts, logically, describing the generation he was born into - My Generation, as he would call it years later in the band's first big hit. Post World War II London was the backdrop to Townshend's childhood, but even more significantly, childhood abuse at the hands of a neglectful relative would create its own war in his soul. As he moves into the awkward teenage and university years we learn of his first encounter with a street tough named Roger Daltrey, his friendship with the stoic John Entwistle and, of course, his first encounter with a completely ginger Keith Moon.<br /><br />One particularly touching moment is revealed as Townshend relays an excerpt from his journal at age 20. He writes that he is putting together his life story thus far as he is sure he is working on something very important and does not have a good friend to tell about it. Other anecdotes are less poignant, especially the two different points in life (one when young, the other not) when Pete sees Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. On both occasions Townshend has a beautiful woman on his arm, and on both occasiosn Waters gives him a quizzical, \\"How does he do it?\\" sort of look.  Other Tales From The Who include the splended re-telling of a couch being shoved out of a hotel room - with the participants then looking out to see the horrified hotel staff staring out their office windows at the mayhem that has just occurred; encounters with groupies; and tales of over-indulgence by Entwistle, Moon, and Townshend himself (Daltrey was fairly well-known to abstain to a large degree, even getting kicked out of the band at one point).<br /><br />The stories of various studio sessions are also quite gripping, with great detail given to the studio equipment, recording techniques, and personnel. We learn about Pete's creative process of writing and recording demos, and how the band then joined together in the studio to put the records together. Another part of the book answered a question I have always had: namely, as I often wondered, Pete insisted early on that Daltrey, Entwistle, and Moon each write a few songs of their own for each Who album. This provided each of them writer's royalties in addition to the (lesser) band member royalties. Even early on, Townshend worked to master his knowledge of the business side (especially after the Shel Talmy lawsuit) and then share beneficial information with the other band members.<br /><br />Criticism of his writings about his first wife are unjustified, as Karen asked to not be mentioned in the book much if at all. Townshend honors this wish. It may feel like a difficult omission, but it is an omission they agreed to and I respect that. Other points in his personal life are not omitted, and his battles with addictions are bluntly recounted. Another moving section reviews his attempt to help Eric Clapton and his then-girlfriend out of severe heroin depression. After driving drunk to Clapton's house, and encountering what seemed to be a very normal scene inside, Pete and his mates realize that they no clue where to start with two heroin addicts.<br /><br />When dealing with the death of Keith Moon, and later of John Entwistle, Pete unsurprisingly spares no mercy toward himself and his reactions. He discusses candidly how he processed the two deaths, on both a personal and a professional level. And in both instances, Townshend very effectively sets the scene leading up to each death. The degree of effective scene-setting gave me chills both times.<br /><br />This is a tour de force of a book, a rock and roll autobiography the likes of which I think we shall not see again.arious studio sessions are also quite gripping, with great detail given to the studio equipment, recording techniques, and personnel.

Even early on, Townshend worked to master his knowledge of the business side (especially after the Shel Talmy lawsuit) and then share beneficial information with the other band members.<br /><br />Criticism of his writings about his first wife are unjustified, as Karen asked to not be mentioned in the book much if at all. Townshend honors this wish. It may feel like a difficult omission, but it is an omission they agreed to and I respect that. Other points in his personal life are not omitted, and his battles with addictions are bluntly recounted. Another moving section reviews his attempt to help Eric Clapton and his then-girlfriend out of severe heroin depression. After driving drunk to Clapton's house, and encountering what seemed to be a very normal scene inside, Pete and his mates realize that they no clue where to start with two heroin addicts.<br /><br />When dealing with the death of Keith Moon, and later of John Entwistle, Pete unsurprisingly spares no mercy toward himself and his reactions. He discusses candidly how he processed the two deaths, on both a personal and a professional level. And in both instances, Townshend very effectively sets the scene leading up to each death. The degree of effective scene-setting gave me chills both times.<br /><br />This is a tour de force of a book, a rock and roll autobiography the likes of which I think we shall not see again.
B00DM2Q9E4|5.0|If you're not familiar yet with Mr Newman look up the(54 million-hit) You Tube video of the single Love Me Again, a sort of wonderful homage to the great  Northern Soul obsession that is still so alive in the UK. The rest of this album is pretty much in the same vein...the Tribute title a respectful nod to the great soul stuff of the past. This still however sounds so fresh and original and I believe it's all self-written and the videos self-directed. Very highly recommended. Once he's hit the US proper, I suspect he's going to become huge. I hope so.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a fun game but too short. I would like something that takes a little longer. I would recommend this app.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Kinda cheesy, but I still wanted to see how it ended. I wouldn't buy it to own or watch it again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|always look forward to playing, but it don't seen fair that i receive lives and don't get to use them, only the 5 that's the only down fall
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is very well written and really makes you think. You become really invested in each character.  One of the best shows on TV!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I have always had an interest in knowing more about this time in the history of our country and more about the orphan trains.  This was an interesting read.  I especially enjoyed the story being told by a teenage foster girl and a 91 year old woman who had been on an orphan train.  Their developing friendship and parallel life stories was well done.  Would highly recomment.  Also, at the end of the book the author includes information on &#34;real life&#34; orphan train organizations.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show was recommended to me by a friend of my son...wasn't real sure what to expect, but I can't turn it off...I enjoy each and every episode and I'm only in Season 1
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Surprised how enthralling this game is it makes you think and is quite challenging. Who knew something free could be so fun!!! It's like going to Las Vegas and not going home broke.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|After you are playing it costs you money to go to the next steps so it isn't free.  want it deleted from my account
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|If you are looking for a good book that makes you fall in love and cry years of sadness too, then this is your book.  The teenagers in the book are quite ill with various forms of cancer and yet their fresh outlook on life is uplifting.  Enjoy!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|This is not all that bad of a program as far as I can tell so far...gave 4 stars as a bit of a learning curve I think...maybe me just being blonde but overall seems to work well...going on a hunting trip this weekend so will see how I like it then...if I can get internet where I am going...can never get a phone signal most of the time.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|This is my 4 year old's new favorite movie.  He asks to watch it every day.  Also, it's very tolerable for adults.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it. Was over joyed that you finally got it on the Kindle and it downloaded and synced right from my phone. Did not have to start over...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it!  Addictive and fun!  Some of the higher levels can be quite challenging but that just makes it all the more exciting.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Artistry of it, the songs, and the story of it keeps it in the favorite section.<br />My children love it!
B00ERIUO02|2.0|I'd like to first say that I'm giving this record just a little bit over two stars because there are some tracks that are worth listening to but for the most part, it's EDM garbage, recycled beats, clichéd lyrics. I think Katy Perry is a very talented performer, her last record had some very good songs (Firework, Teenage Dream, Circle the Drain, Hummingbird Heartbeat), and this record really lacks the consistency of her previous record. This record attempts to jump around genres and it just doesn't work because their is no coherence, it's just one song after the next, not an album. I think Perry's best songs on this record are the ones that are the most cerebral and personal. Perry herself stated that she was sick of mainstream pop music and that she would abandon it following this album and tour, I can see why with the catastrophe this record is and the fact that all pop music has become very derivative and boring. Here's a track by track review:<br /><br />1. \\"Roar\\" 7/10 - A fairly good single, very radio friendly, catchy, the lyrics are uplifting and chorus is energetic. Unfortunately, the lyrics while very uplifting and positive are very clichéd and derivative. The ending of the chorus if very annoying with the tremolo like 'oh oh oh's'. It's a good lead off single but it's misleading because the rest of the record bares little resemblance to this song. This song contains some real instrumentation while the remainder of the album is mostly electronic.<br /><br />2. \\"Legendary Lovers\\" 7/10 - The electronic beats are very boring, the chorus is catchy, the lyrics are good but the vocals lack until the chorus rips around. This is another track that could be improved to be a breakout hit. I feel that this is one of the stronger tracks even though it receives the same score as 'Roar'.<br /><br />3. \\"Birthday\\" 5/10 - I heard the funky groove and soulful vocals and I thought this would be a hit. It turns out the lyrics are very bad, nothing but stereotypical 'birthday' lyrics. The chorus is catchy but I just can't take it seriously. The instrumentation is a sigh of relief but I think the lyrics and vocals ruin this song.<br /><br />4. \\"Walking on Air\\" 7/10 - This is very EDM influenced, the beat is catchy, the lyrics are clichéd but they work, the vocals are strong enough to carry the song. The chorus is catchy but the lyrics are bland and lack originality. I enjoy the song only because the production is excellent, the vocals are good, and the beat is catchy.<br /><br />5. \\"Unconditionally\\" 9/10 - The best track on the record, it's a very emotional the lyrics are very personal, the beat is a little boring but once the chorus comes around it becomes a powerhouse. The lyrics are a little forced but I think the vocal force makes it work. It's the best song on the record but still it could use a little work.<br /><br />6. \\"Dark Horse\\" 2/10 - Horrible song after a great song, the beat is so cheap, the production is poor. The little sound effects are very annoying, Perry's vocals just do not work with this style of hip-hop music. It's just a boring song.<br /><br />7. \\"This is How We Do\\" 4/10 - Not a good song, the lyrics are poor at best, it's very clichéd and derivative. The chorus features very monotonous vocals and just becomes very irritating. This song while has a catchy beat lacks emotion and intelligence.<br /><br />8. \\"International Smile\\" 6/10 - Reminds me a bit of Hummingbird Heartbeat, the beat is very similar, the little guitar riff is similar, it's a catchy tune with a powerhouse chorus. The vocals are very good on this track but personally, when a song sounds so close to another song but fails to recapture the originals magic, I tend to not enjoy it and go back to the original.<br /><br />9. \\"Ghost\\" 5/10 - Another mid tempo track, the lyrics are personal again but they lack the power from Unconditionally. The beat is annoying in the verses, the chorus is catchy but fails to impress compared to some of the other choruses on the record.<br /><br />10. \\"Love Me\\" 6/10 - The beat is quick, the lyrics are cerebral which is a plus, the start of the song is great, I really enjoy it, the lyrics aren't as cliché as some of the other songs on the record but the chorus is just bad. It resembles too closely the verse, the vocals are too similar and really add no power. Listen for the verses, it's not something you do too much in pop music nowadays.<br /><br />11. \\"This Moment\\" 6/10 - Sounds like something Daft Punk would do, the lyrics aren't good but they're not bad. The beat is catchy, the verse builds up well to a fairly powerful chorus. It's one of those songs that if you're into anything that has a good beat, then you will like it. If your searching for something more original then this track might not do it for you.<br /><br />12. \\"Double Rainbow\\" 4/10 - Boring song, the lyrics are not too bad but are just so full of clichés. The chorus isn't that great, the verses are boring, it's just not a good song.<br /><br />13. \\"By the Grace of God\\" 9/10 - Another great track, starts with a soft piano, the lyrics are cerebral and personal, the vocals are emotional and heartfelt, powerful song. The perfect amount of vocal effects are added, the production is beautiful, it's a great song. The chorus shouldn't be electronic thought, it should be an acoustic guitar and maintain that personal identity. That's the only downfall of the song. Great lyrics in the chorus, the electronics are not necessary.<br /><br />This record is a mixed bag, there is a lot of filler, about three really good songs but overall this album lacks the coherence of Teenage Dream and doesn't live up to some of the better pop releases. I will admit that I listen to mostly metal music but I do enjoy every genre of music for what it is. I talk a lot about derivative beats and clichés because those are the quirks that annoy me the most and I feel that this record uses so much that has already been done. If you enjoy it, that'sfine, good for you. I would not recommend this anybody but hardcore Katy Perry fans because I think it'll keep them happy enough until she puts out some really good music. Enjoy, or don't, whatever floats your boat.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|Well it is nothing what I expected...it starts you in a spot with the animals you are suppose to hunt right in front of you every time...you point and shoot...and unless it gives you a specific location to shoot like a lung shot it don't seem to matter where you shoot it to get a kill...even shot one from behind in the tail and got the kill. So to me not so much fun at least in the early part of the game.<br />Now will never know if it ever gets better because after the first day it quit loading...that was enough for me to just take off my kindle...enough is enough...only reason I gave it two stars is if it would stay working it would probably be fun for young kids.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I LOVE Star Trek and at this price, I love it even more! Great deal for all these blu rays.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy Perry impresses once again with her new album &#34;PRISM&#34;.  She has many different songs on it from upbeat party songs like Roar or strong ballads like Unconditionally.  I don't doubt that she will have multiple hit singles from this album in the near future.  A bonus from buying this album on Amazon is that you get the MP3 download immediately after purchase while you are waiting for the album in the mail.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Poignant, honest, brilliant. Be prepared for the immediate attachment to Hazel Grace and Augustus and the story of their love.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and couldn't put it down. However, I wish the end was more optimistic and less uncertain.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|easy and fun to play. good for everyone and easy to earn coins, but you cant get most of the main characters unless you pay with real money
B005OCFHHK|4.0|It's the complete movie collection on blu-ray. That being said, all of the discs don't &#34;match&#34;. Meaning it seems like they just pieced together a box set, and didn't make the 8 discs exclusively for this set. If that matters to you, it didn't matter to me. I love it. We do Harry Potter marathons now and then and it fit our needs just right. I am not going to give it a five star rating because of the mismatched discs.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Had been a very good awakening of what is going on with the &#34;food Industry&#34; No to let you fool!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited this is on kindle fire now . I love candy crush and have been waiting to play on my kindle
B008JFUNKU|4.0|Captain Philips is an action packed drama about an American ship sailing somewhere around Africa.  Among the highlights we see Tom Hanks, some great action packed scenes designed for theater viewing, people with projectors and home theaters at home will absolutely love this.  I liked the sense of hysteria the film jumped into twenty minutes from when it began. We were quite surprised by the intensity and just how good the acting was. Is this story believable? It most certainly is. Yes, there is a brief lull in the the latter half of the third quarter but it ends most uniquely. I give it between 3.5 and 4.0 stars specifically because I thought the storyline wasn't that great but the execution was very good, they really make you get into the head of both villain and hero. Also there were a few scenes which may make you chuckle nervously. It's good to see Hanks back in action.
B001TH16DI|5.0|What a great package for all the classic Star Trek movies. It is compact and includes all the original Star Trek cast movies. A great addition to any SciFi fan's high definition collection.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Even Brad Pitt couldn't save this abomination.<br /><br />The music was lame. The acting was limp.  The story was...there was a story?<br /><br />I had been warned to separate the book and the movie and I made sure I went into knowing that other than a few locations and side notes, this had nothing to do with Max Brooks' amazing novel about the time zombies almost wiped is off the planet. I was fine with that.<br /><br />However this movie had nothing to do with the book or good movie making. I guess they blew their was acquiring the rights to the name World War Z. Never since Stephen King have I seen a movie so far off from its roots.<br /><br />The only cool scene in the movie was the zombies taking the wall in Israel and I saw that in the trailer. Incidentally, that's what made me want to see the movie. For once zombies were lumbering morons - they had a purpose and they would stop at nothing to get it. Instead of building on that excitement from the trailer the movie left me empty with nothing else to catch my attention for the nearly two hour running time.<br /><br />As I said on Facebook (and found a lot of people in agreement): &#34;Dear World War Z, I want my money back.&#34;
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put these books down. Read the trilogy in a week. I would and have recommended these books to many people.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's one of those games you can't stop  playing.  The hardest part of this game is waiting to receive your 5 lives so you can play again.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is awesome and very addictive. It is definitely one of my favorite games. I usually don't buy games but this one is worth every penny.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love this show, it has everything....suspense, comedy, and great eye candy. The stories are interesting and the actors are wonderful.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Our book club read this and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it!  A real page turner and lots to talk about at meeting.
B00338QENI|5.0|I'm in a book club and didn't know if I would like this book.  It is simply amazing.  Makes you think about what things were back in time.  I am impressed with the writer of how she kept this rolling along.  I was a different person after I read this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive. I have my husband playing now. It is a challenging game,  that keeps you wanting to play
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is a very good product because it transform any TV into a smart TV with the basic characteristics .
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series gab  me hope in a time of despair and need. Reminded me to fight and work harder. There is something beautiful about the girl on fire....about who she is as a person.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This app is really fun to play...the only thing I don't like is when you lose all your saved lives and certain levels you breeze thru while others take days, weeks, or even months to complete.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Good entertainment.  What's not to like about giant robots beating each other up.  Perfect movie that kid would remember from his childhood.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Keeps me in touch with family/friends.  Allows me to view pictures I would not to be able to see without this social media.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I just got this game because it wasn't on Amazon before.<br />Just another match-3 game....nothing bad about it (I play it with the sound off, because the sounds are annoying!)<br />Cute graphics.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Awesome movie must watch again or buy movie it. Is one of a kind movie I love the movie all around
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits could be better than LA Law and Boston Legal, the two legal dramas that have set the very high gold standard. The cast of characters bring out both the human and professional side of lawyers, the past and the present, the hunter and the apprentice, the suave and the awkward, the complex relationships, along with a good dose of dry humor. Each episode centers around a new case that brings out interesting tactics and defendants to the front, as the main actors engage to find a solution. Watch any Suits episode and you are bound to get hooked!
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|I give two stars because it is not funny as I thought. The story is boring. I did not like this movie
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer seems to have taken a different style with this album and the preceding one.  We are very happy with our purchases.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Perfect for kids or adults! I LOVE it! The minions are one of the best evil crews around! Ten stars!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i really enjoyed reading this book and i even criedat the end :,( because itis so sad. But The Fault in Our Stars will forever be my favorite book
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was excellent and I can't wait for number two! The plot was not one that could have been easily guessed within five minutes, and the characters are great. Awesome read!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Prism: the new album by Katy Perry is phenomenal! Through the past three years- Katy has been rediscovering herself through so many mistakes and roller-coaster type life. And at that time- she found God through her Christian roots. In the album she starts of ROARing with the hit single, Roar. From there she has some party tunes- hinting pack to her past works- and then she gets into a more raw, emotional side of her. By the time that By The Grace Of God comes by- you can identify that Katy is not who she once was. And shes letting the light shine through her- and giving it to the world! Outstanding album, Katy!!! :)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Awesome. My friend walked in on me watching this and freaked. This is an awesome show. And it is my favorite thus far.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It is not his best work but it is still entertaining. Kept me guessing for a bit, made me wonder how much was actually doable.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Four friends go on an adventure and one of them has cancer. The story line itself is predictable, but the carry through was amazing. I have seen some people complain that it is slow and boring because the friends talk a lot, but that is the point of the movie. Their relationships to one another, how one of them hadn't been around for years, and the ways their lives differ is kind of the point. Life is obviously a big theme in this movie, but it approaches it differently than in most terminally ill movies, in a way that is offensive but at the same time true for the average person. The acting was wonderful. It was sad, I cried, but was a great movie.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Grease is the word! Friday nights in fall and winter are movie nights for me and my girls (6&7). We had a blast watching this classic.  So happy to see it was available on Instant Prime.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book kept me on my toes it was hard to put down thank you very much I love a good romance
140006922X|5.0|Excellent. It gave me a background of the first century during the time of Jesus.This book should be required reading.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Arrow here, sword there. Awesome scenes and story line. Watch it, buy it, do what you must but get your hands on this.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Its nice graphics easy  to understand the game very fast loading simple to  play overall i will give 4 rating
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked this book, it keeps you on your toes. Was a very good page turner to read<br /><br />Very anticlimactic ending though
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cute to the last banana. I cannot wait for merchandising and another installment to this game. I just wish kindle fire responds a little faster.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I wish you could edit items after you create them like in scribblenaughts unlimited. The app is still really fun though.
B004KAWC0C|3.0|I know it isn't as good as seeing the musical, but for a movie it is pretty good.  I enjoyed watching it.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Slowly but surely it is building up to be a great season. I enjoyed all the seasons (2, 1, 3 - order from most to least enjoyed), and this one is sure not to disappoint. Zombie-pig-flu!?!?
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The writing was simple yet elegant and expressive. Even though the story was slightly dark, I laughed out loud at the author's choice of words, and really came to know, love, and understand the &#34;misremembered&#34; man.  It is a book to remember and even to read again.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The crude language is the only thing that bothered me as I read this and other King writings. I don't understand why vulgarity has to be used to tell a great story. It seems to me that our dictionaries have plenty of options that can be chosen to tell the story without cheapening it with mindless vulgarity. (I will now climb down off my soap box.)<br /><br />But I loved the premise of the book. I felt the issue of time travel and the possibility of changing historical tragedies is indeed intriguing and skillfully engaged my imagination throughout this book. The character development was wonderful and the stories of love, hope, and enlightenment were delivered with elegance and grace.
B0091VTISO|2.0|Doesn't compare to the original movie, I think they should leave well enough alone. It's hard to compete with Arnold.
B00760BPOC|4.0|GRRM's latest and greatest will no doubt both frustrate (for those wanting faster progress and more) and delight (for those of us less worker up about his diverse writing interests) readers. I put myself in the later group, though I am, no question, keen for more.<br /><br />Several of the main story lines progress well, including those of Arya, Tyrion, and Dany. Others, like Sansa and Baelish, seem almost forgotten.<br /><br />GRRM remains among the finest of modern fantasy's writers, and you will not be disappointed (my points above notwithstanding).
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Interesting story with feelings shown through the language of flowers.  A bit different from my usual read, but enjoyed it.  Very interesting concept.
B004LWZW24|3.0|So if you are into scary movies like I am and want to be scared this is not the movie for you. Yeah, it has some good parts but we need to remember it is PG13.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Better than the critics reported. This movie is excellent. Jaden is an excellent actor. He is going to be a leading man.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|I haven't traditionally been a huge fan of AMD APUs, but with their more recent APUs they have kicked it into high gear. For what you pay for the A10-6800K there is nothing else on the market that can do what this can do. Sure you can pay more for intel, but their iGPU can't compare for the money.<br /><br />You can set up crossfire with a discrete (dedicated) GPU which will effectively double (slightly less than double) your gaming potential. Pair this baby with an HD 7750 and you've got a console killer.<br /><br />There are always reasons to go with Intel vs AMD, and in the past I have exclusively used Intel in all my workstation machines. I have now found my favorite goto CPU/GPU combo for HTPC or low end gaming.
B009WUBERW|5.0|If you liked Expendables 1 you will surely love Expendables 2 great action fast pace brought out all the old heros
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I just received Sycamore Row on my Kindle and can't put it down.  I just love John Grisham's writing and am glad Jake is back!
1401938906|5.0|Easy read , very easy to follow and funny too I think it would be a great gift for your family and friends for Christmas
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is having a blast playing this game. She is all smiles while feeding and grooming the horse. Thank you!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I play everyday I check on my farm all the time feeding and growing plants. it feels like I am on a real farm.I would know because I grew up on my dads farm.This game is good it keep you coming back for more. I would say try it you will like it.
B00004YA66|5.0|It is a great movie and it is what I wanted.  It was in perfect shape when it arrived and it was what everyone was talking about.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Touching, well written and well researched book.  The book jumps from the past to the present.  Because I put the book down for a couple of days after I started it, I didn't immediately get what was going on - the connection between the characters. Once I did, I appreciated the way the book was written.  Definitely worth reading.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|OMG!!! What can I say about this product. My 5 month old little boy loved his Jumperoo the minute we put him in it. He spins around, jumps, plays with the toys and laughs at the sounds it makes. It is great exercise and I can see it strengthening his little legs too. He is very rough and puts this product to the test. It is made very well yet it comes apart easily to put in the car when he goes somewhere for a visit. Great item for any baby.
B000002PCS|5.0|Arrived in the mail only a few days after I purchased it.  Great soundtrack.  A must keep on hand classic.  Would highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Like the game. But it seems to get stuck at times on my kindle fire. Some times it takes me a while to do tbe levels.ca dy crush r
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What a great game and well worth the money.  I have been waiting for it to come out on Kindle since my friends keep asking me to play.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I almost didn't buy this because of the negative reviews, but I thought I'd give it a chance.  I'm sorry I did.  One review said you have to get past the situation that she is in to enjoy the book.  I'm trying to do that, but right now I'm still going 'Ugh'.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This was a Christmas present.  The person I bought this for was thrilled.  He loves the Big Bang Theory.  I was very pleased with the seller.  I received my order on time as stated.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|Though I liked the scifi hardware the story did absolutely nothing and Jaden didn't help it either. Why can't there be just a little more logic and storylines along with the human drama.... Not well conceived at all.<br /><br />AJ
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really Hope they keep it to the storyline on Book & they don't ruin the movie, Cause it has so much potential to be just an Amazing movie...!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This game gets to the installing stage and says I don't have enough room on my kindle when that's the first game I wonted to download.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book grabbed me.  Some of the authors words left me with such reflection.. So many highlights and notes I made.  At times poetically written
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I gave it four stars for the uniqueness of the show.  I took a star off for graphics.  Granted it was made back in 2002, the graphics were still not super.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game, glad it transferred the level I was on,  however I do not like that it did not transfer the number of games I had from my other device. That totally sucks. I have 144 games allowable on my other device so I find myself going back to it when I run out of games on my Kindle. You need to fix this.  If you are allowing us to play on our kindle ( which i am very happy about) everything should be interchangeable.
B007A4SDCG|3.0|Average reading for the non-writer. i did appreciate the the idea of resistance, but that could have been covered in one chapter.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have often wondered how Danny turned out. Pretty damn good, I see :). Awesome book, sir. Thank you very much!
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|I have been a Lynch fan for quite sometime and i was too young to really understand the show during its initial run in the early nineties but upon a second more mature viewing i must say it is pure genius. I really enjoy how the show allows for the viewer two options: you can enjoy it as a simple show with its melodrama and utter weirdness or you can attempt to dig deeper into the psychology of the show and its rather abstract symbolism. Either way its a great watch. Highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great book! Just as good, if not better then The Shining! Highly recommend!  Scary and shocking and heartwarming all at the same time!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It was about time. It connected right to Facebook, but doesn't stay connected. I had to turn the kindle off and back on in order to reconnect. When trying to ask friends for help,  it doesn't list people that play the game. I had to search for them.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I LOVED the first two books. Enjoyed majority of this book until<br />the very end.<br /><br />*****Spoilers****<br /><br />Really don't mean to be mean to the writer<br />but, have to be honest. Really not sure why the editors<br />didn't try to convince her to change the ending.<br />Really, really, really wish someone had.<br /><br />The moment I got that they were killing of the main character. I<br />had to pause and think...WHY? No really. Does being that<br />shocking really mean upsetting all these people that love the books.<br />I don't get it.<br /><br />I cried at the end about Tobias being all alone in a small<br />apartment sad once and a while. That 's a horrible ending.<br />I pictured them living together happy and with child on the way.<br /><br />There is a reason Twilight, Hunger Games, Harry Potter ended<br />well. Harry Potter, Bella & Edward, and Katniss....Didn't die.<br />I have no idea how they'll try and make the rest of the movies<br />with the fan base in an uproar.<br /><br />I love the series up until the exact moment Tris was killed off.<br />I'm considering rewriting the ending myself just to feel better.<br />So very disappointed.<br /><br />Like taking all those great memories of reading the first<br />two books and the third book is like memory serum. POOF all gone.
B00AY7Q01C|4.0|A real study in humility.  Or a study in incompetent management in the music industry in the early days.  I'm glad to see this guy is reaping his just rewards now.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|I tried everything to get it to download and it wouldn't so I ended up having to buy the upgrade for $2.99.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It's fun an all but I hate waiting games o it takes ten hours to get rid of a small rock.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|THESE ACTORS ARE ABSOLUTELY  PURE TALENT. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. YOU WATCH IN AWE AT HOW THIS IS DONE. MY CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THIS TALENT...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the way the weather channel keeps me informed about the local weather forecast as well as some amazing videos of weird things happening around the world.<br /><br />Jem
B009NX1YT6|5.0|After watching this movie for the 12th time I realized that is a great movie. My daughter who is 14 loves it and has what it with all her friends, us parents and along she has seen the movie over 21 times, knows the lyrics, songs and dialogue.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series, read all three.  Couldn't get enough!  Would highly recommend to readers of all ages.  Will look for other works by this author.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Action packed thriller from the beginning to the end. The sound and visual effects are superb.I enjoyed every bit of it.
B003FNWR6Y|4.0|What a great way to play this game! Its an amazing buy and we enjoy playing it. Its colorful and the characters really jump out of the game
B0090X4GLW|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!  GREAT SONGS, LOVE TO LISTEN TO THE WAY THEY MAKE MUSIC WITH NOTHING BUT THEIR MOUTHS. IT'S QUITE AMAZING.....
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I really enjoyed the first novel and thought &#34;Hey, why not buy the next one?&#34;... So I did.  I was pretty pleased with the second novel as the action was constant and fast paced - not too much description, lots of interesting stuff happens.  I really enjoy the multiple perspectives a la Robert Jordan and have to say that, at least up until book 3, GRRM seems to do a better job at telling the story from multiple perspectives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  I love it.  Can't stop playing.  Was so happy when it was available for kindle fire.  Been playing for months.  Love the different levels and episodes, but hate those chocolates.  Not giving up though, on level 132.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. It was challenging but not you heard. Loved it, just wish it had more levels...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was awesome. It kept me in interest throughout. The love scenes were so powerful that I could feel my hairs prickle throughout my body (among everything else). Looking forward to book 2.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|What a story, the book was a constant source of entertainment, very fun. How did this guy live to be 100 drinking that much Vodka,
B00258SS72|5.0|i HAVE WATCHED GRAN TORINO 5 TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED IT, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT, IT'S A GREAT MOVIE, AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY!!!! WILL PROBABLY WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN CLINT EASTWOOD IS A GREAT DIRECTOR, AND EVEN GREATER ACTOR!!!!! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!!!
B004I2K4E8|4.0|To be honest... I much preferred this version over the movie currently in the theaters. But, I usually prefer the &#34;live&#34; theater experience.
1476727651|5.0|I listened to this on cd  The reader was awesome  The story was great, although not as scary as the Shining was because I think the Shinig is more physcologically scary.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Time to enjoy this one plus this way I couls have 10 lives 15 if you count on the computer. It all works out for the best. =)
B00F91RYL8|4.0|First off, this movie isn't really at all like the book.  I knew from the previews that it wasn't, which is no problem.  However, not a lot happened in this movie.  I felt like it had potential to be better, but it is still overall a good movie.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I always wondered what happened to Danny.  Plus there had to be others and those who would seek to benefit from those skills.  No spoiler alert but the conflict, both internal and external, leads the reader through story.  New characters may lead to further sequels.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I loved my Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player...I was looking for one to attach to my laptop to stream to my tv but this one attaches to tv n doesnt' stream exactly as i wished...I have movies on laptop i'd like to stream like my old media did that came with windows 7.... will watching movies from laptop n streaming to tv from laptop, i'd like to be able to use laptop while movies r streaming to tv..this one can only stream using attachment on tv n can't use laptop for games while its streaming...need an attachment that attaches to laptop to stream to tv while movies r playing to tv but i can use my laptop for games, etc please let me know...thanks!!!
B00867GJYK|5.0|Even more beautiful on BluRay.  Glad to have this in my library.  Loved it as much this time as the first time I watched it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is lots of fun and highly addictive. Once you pick it up you won't want to put it down!  I love it!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I tiptoed up to this book cautiously, for  two reasons. The first is, The Shining is so spectacularly amazing, how can there possibly be a sequel that compares to it, and the second more obvious reason, is that it will probably scare my socks off.  I don't know how I ever doubted the master of horror's abilities, but he definitely delivered in this book - there is no reason to fear this sequel. And I was right - this book certainly instilled fear and inspired nightmares. But of course, isn't that the reason you would reason a King book? For me, yes, yes it is, but it is still smart to proceed with caution, right? When you get a tattoo you know it is going to hurt, but you still want it.<br /><br />While reading this book, I was reminded almost immediately of the thing that terrified me the most in The Shining - the woman in room 217, Mrs. Massey. When I read The Shining, she made me afraid to go into the bathroom, or pull back the shower curtain; in Doctor Sleep, we are reminded of her by a young Danny Torrance, and again, she made me a little afraid of bathrooms, especially if you have to get up in the middle of the night. I know this for a fact. Everyone I talked to had a different &#34;scariest part&#34; - my brother and his best friend were both freaked out by the &#34;redrum&#34; parts - and I feel badly about this, since I am positive I used to say it all the time to both of them, while moving my finger like in the movie. (Sorry guys) Others cited the moving topiaries, others the bartender. Whatever the flavor, we all agreed that The Shining was splendidly horrific. Doctor Sleep is a little different. It's not as in your face, except for a few places. It has its moments, but mostly you are just genuinely horrified by what could happen. At least this was the case for me.<br /><br />We are reunited with Danny Torrance as an adult. Has he survived the terrors of that winter at the Overlook Hotel unscathed? Mmm not so much. And he is creating his own moments as an adult - one especially becomes the defining moment of his adulthood, the one thing he is trying to get past but can't get out of his head. He has some new ghosts now, blowing around in his mind.<br /><br />The villains this time are not confined to a hotel and its grounds - they instead roam free over the country, in RV's,  motor homes, Winnebago's, and campers. Honestly, I won't look at someone driving one the same way again. Or at least, I might think twice. They call themselves the True Knot, and they are some crazy scary freaks. Their leader, Rose the Hat, is smart and wily, and psychotic and selfish. Interesting note here - Rose the Hat and her crew have dumped their actual legal names, which they call their rube names, and go by nicknames. Like pirates or vikings. And Danny has an alter ego as well, just in a different way. I just thought it was interesting too since in Joyland, King also refers to people not in the game as rubes.<br /><br />We also meet Abra Stone, a magical young girl who has the shining, like Danny - or Dan as he is called in this book. Her powers are huge, and are attractive to the True Knot, for their own awful reasons. I don't want to give much of anything away, there is just so much story in this book, all the characters have their own thread, until the moment they start to intertwine, and the plot picks up its pace, running through the pages, with reader following like a rabbit after a carrot. There are surprises, revelations, and an ending that will blow your mind.<br /><br /> I absolutely loved this book, and King remains one of my favorite authors of all time.adult - one especially becomes the defining moment of his adulthood, the one thing he is trying to get past but can't get out of his head.

B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is a great family movie. My wife and I thought it was delightful. My 9 and 7 year old love to quote their favorite funny parts. We will definitely purchase this movie to own!
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Let's face it.  Intel has beaten AMD by mile the last few years in processor performance.  Nothing can touch the I7 series for sure processing power.  You also pay a premium for them.  Most people don't take advantage of this raw computing power unless you are doing video editing, Digital Audio work or heavy gaming type applications.  The typical person uses their computer for e-mail, word processing and internet browsing.  If that is you - why not save some money and buy this processor.<br /><br />I was looking for a low cost machine to store and access over 1000 albums I had ripped to FLAC files.  I wanted it all on a single hard drive so I could access my music quickly at home without having to search through all my CD's.  I purchased this processor as part of DIY machine build.  The cost was incredibly inexpensive and I didn't need a ton of computing power for this task.  I had recently built a computer for a neighbor using the A4 version and was quite impressed with how it performed.  This processor was just a step up from the A4 with a little faster clock speed.<br /><br />My machine ended up becoming more than just an audio server as I recently dumped my cable bill for streaming video content from the internet.  This PC is connected to a very good outboard DAC via a USB connection for audio and I also have it connected to my 54 inch Plasma HD TV via an HDMI connection. (Just using the built in video processor of this APU)<br /><br />This dual core APU doesn't miss a beat.  I'm running windows 8.1 and it handles everything I throw at it.  I never overclocked it and it handles audio as well as video serving tasks with finese.  In fact, it does it's job much better than I ever thought it would.  I never see any lag on HD video output. The video processor built into this is not state of the art by today's standards, but quite capable for light-medium gaming and HD video streaming.  A few years ago no one would have ever believed you could have built a video processor like this into a processor chip.  AMD certainly has Intel beat in this area. What that means for you is BANG FOR THE BUCK!<br /><br />This APU runs on very little power and therefore doesn't require a lot of cooling.  I don't even hear my stock CPU fan running.  I would highly recommend this processor for a Home video/audio server application like I am using it for or for  typical computing tasks.  As others have stated, putting in faster RAM does benefit this processor.  I'm using slower RAM than it's capable of handling and it is still very impressive.<br /><br />This processor certainly wouldn't be a choice for my Digital Audio Workstation, but let's be fair here.  AMD never intended this APU line to be competitive for these kinds of applications.<br /><br />AMD may not have the fastest processors on the market, but they have the best bang for the buck for the majority of users. (Running typical applications)<br /><br />I think some people go overboard and purchase the A8 or A10 and then find they have to spend more money dealing with the heat, bigger power supplies, etc.  I'm not knocking the A8 or A10 - but for my application it is overkill and I wouldn't have been able to build a machine as cheaply as I did with the A6.  There's something to be said about the A6 and the ability to build a low cost machine that uses very little power, stays cool and does most tasks extremely well.<br /><br />AMD built a winner with this APU line.  The A6 is a very capable processor for the typical application user.  Highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so awesome. I really love this game. It would be better though if you added more vehicles and gadgets.
0345803485|1.0|I read several of the reviews for this book, as well as for the boxed set. I've wondered what the hype about this trilogy has been since I first heard of it, even more when I learned it was just Twilight fanfiction with name changes. Unfortunately, my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to read the preview the site provided. I'll admit the writing isn't nearly as atrocious as I've heard it described, though I have certainly read better. I also found myself skipping entire paragraphs, yet feeling like I hadn't missed anything. The book is, in all essence, just dull. Very, very dull. There doesn't seem to be much plot, conflict or character development either. The descriptions and actions are also remarkably repetitive. They make me feel like the author either wasn't trying or was straying too close to the (decrepit) source material. Mix this with the fact this series is known as &#34;mommy porn&#34; and you have a guarantee I will never read nor recommend them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for th  kindle to get candy crush and it  finally here.  I like that it connects with Facebook and you don't have to start over.  I like that you can hand swipe an  don't have  to click with the mouse. Definitely five star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy this game is out for kindle fire the best match game out there please put more games like this
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is like 100 Doors, except you can actually complete these levels on your own, no guide required. I hate it when a solution doesn't make any sense, and that doesn't happen with this game. And you still have to use your brain to figure things out. Some of the levels take quite a bit of time, which is a good thing, in my opinion. This is definitely not too easy.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Actually, I am not even half done, but so far, I  am enjoying it very much.  A lot more interesting as I go along.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book, it only took me a week to read....and I work full time and take college courses, that's how much it kept my attention : D
B00C5R8364|5.0|I couldn't put it down.<br />Details and descriptions were excellent .<br />You felt like you were right there with them!<br />Loved the book!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written. An anthology of real life, love and loses! Tops Kite Runner. I was able to feel, see and share a whole life.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Sparse and enticing.  Despairing, often disturbing, but entirely honest in it's intent to show the human state inside North Korea, and the suffering endured by all who quest for their individual identity.
B009R659L8|5.0|Enjoyed the book, as always the plot was different and twisted and surprising that I liked, could not wait for the end. And as always I was not disappointed. Hope you enjoy it to.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|Visually stunning and a great modern take on a classic. Cast fulfills the roles and I loved how the director created a world of the past yet seemed so of the future also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How much I enjoy this game.  I'm 26 years old!  What on earth has happened to me.  I love Despicable Me!
B008ROZAQU|5.0|Awsome movie! John Wayne is a great actor, I loved to watch all his movie never gets old. His good what he does.
B007TK77QE|3.0|She can really paint a picture with what she writes.. But felt slightly let down by the way the book ended. But over all good read!!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Easy load on the Kindle Fire (1st gen) and works real nice - plenty of high-quality video and audio. Not 5 stars because there is no volume control within the videos screen.
0743243153|3.0|The advice is good but the information is really outdated. It could mislead people who are not in psychology field. &#34;Character disorder&#34; is used way too freely. &#34;In a sense all children have character disorders&#34; - this is a dangerous statement in a world where kids are largely over-diagnosed. And &#34;kids are suffering from childhood&#34; as Sir Ken Robinson has said in his TED speech. We have to sober up and start thinking critically of what we are doing.<br />And one example made me laugh where the author is telling a personal anecdote of how he felt miserable about his life choice and went for help to his friend and the friend told him to solve his problem on his own. The author says &#34;I realized I have a character disorder&#34; and simply by accepting the responsibility for his choice he became fine: without the character disorder. Now do you see how &#34;character disorder&#34; is being used as some daily word?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the products that combines nice technology, with simplicity and a very reasonable price ($35). Although it is limited to cast only from Google products, e.g. YouTube, Chrome Browser, etc. but the simplicity and fun in doing that makes it really enjoyably product to utilize. For YouTube, you can stream/cast directly on your TV from any iOS or Android Smartphone or Tablet just with a single click on Cast Icon, and it works like a charm, brilliant. Highly recommended to buy one especially if your TV does not have apps like YouTube, Browser, etc. Enjoy.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|I really liked this movie just wished it was a little longer. Very funny clips. I heard that it wasn't as good as the first 2 but I disagree.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's finally here on Kindle Fire &amp; I have had no problems with it. Smooth easy play.  Connects to Facebook perfectly. I can't complain. : )
B002ZG997C|4.0|This was a gift for someone.  It is a great movie with a great surprise ending!!! I highly recommend it.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I really like the keys being so large, makes it very easy to see especially if you're in a hurry to get a tip amount or other calculation. The memory is great so you can go back and look for an error or just to check a previous calculation.  So far, I have had no problems with this app or complaints about it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is challenging but awesome! I enjoy spending my down time playing it before I go to bed even though my kids help sometimes. It's fun!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|A very creative look at the development of super powers in certain people has a &#34;Dystopian&#34; effect on society instead of Utopian. This clever idea plus action packed writing with excellent character development rounds out this well written novel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get the updates has armor and cakes and buckets get this app the best blocky game I got a diamond from a glitch
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment, and not just for the reasons everyone is saying.  The plot, the writing, the failure of the two narrators, and yes, the ending -- they all made this book horrible.  I am very disappointed and wish I had stopped at the second book.  I hope the movie changes not only the ending but the entire story because this revelation about genetic experiments is just plain stupid.  Epic fail times ten.
B009R89HY6|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and the doodles.<br />It was so sweet to go back to school times.<br />Definitely gonna read the rest of  this series.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it! A very quick read and great sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;! As always, great character development, which I always enjoy; so many authors do not have this gift. Stephen King must be a Big Bang fan; I'm sure there is a reference!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Like the collection so far, was nice to revisit old favs! Would recommend adding this to your collection of Trekie movies.
B00112HZEA|5.0|I love every single detail from this toy, those eyes are so awesome. I think my cousin's son will love it too :) .

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I work outside for a living and their radar feature is invaluable. Thank you and keep up the good work...
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I really, really love thus movie & have watched it at least 5 times. It is similar to &#34; Somewhere In Time&#34; but with a better ending. If you liked Somewhere in Time I think you will really like this movie.
B004K58GSO|5.0|A movie featuring two Hollywood legends and a will be legend. Simply a classic Western that has all the highs and lows as well as action you would come to expect from the Duke himself!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Simply magnificent. Terrible and wonderful at once. Couldn't put it down. Very curious how filmmakers will bring it to life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to finally have this on the kindle! Love this game and I'm enjoying starting all over and playing from the beginning again. Yes you can tie into Facebook but it's fun to start from scratch!!!
B00866JL96|5.0|A movie worth getting so i would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a sad movie / happy ending.
B002APU580|5.0|A true Romance story & one of Jane Austen's best. I love books & movies based on this era, I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product tooked time for coming but  and soon I setup very easy and Im enjoy now for see internet. I loved
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Third generation family favorite!  Bought this movie for my grandson, because it was his father's favorite, and my younger brother's favorite.  He's already watched it many times, and can sing some of the songs.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|won't even let me load or log on. so my game apps wont work with it. deleting app as soon as I'm done typing
B00006L7XQ|5.0|It's Johnny Cash! There is NOT anything bad this man ever out out. His work just before his death to me was really his best. I will be ordering Ain't No Grave, next. Really like the Cloud Player that compliments this, goes well with the daily walks.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. Only thing I don't like is the slight lag the game gets when you complete the challenges. It interrupts game play and has on multiple occasions ruined my winning streak :-(
B0035HKWLW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I love the music and the wacky behavior of all the actors. Very entertaining and always makes me laugh!
B003MC5AV2|5.0|One of the best books ever! I loved all of the emotion and it was such a great book!! I totally recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kept my interest from page one to the last page! Finished the book in 2  days as I couldn't put it down
B00ENYCQX8|4.0|I just got the app, tested it and so far it works with no crashes as for my kindle I love that thing.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very good and also very challenging i love 5 stars hand down no questions asked i would totally by this app well i have but u should buy this app
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I discovered this app while goofing around on my husband's iPad. I was soon addicted and eventually I was no longer allowed to borrow the iPad because I was using it for long periods of time.  A few days passed and I was in serious candy withdrawal.  I was stuck on level 87 with no hope of ever playing again when I saw it amongst the newly released Kindle apps.  I was able to recover my progress since I was using the Facebook login.  I am so happy now.  This is the best match game in history, and I have played them all.<br />Reasons for greatness:<br />1. Hundreds of levels, literally over 400 at this time with more coming.<br />2. It is for all ages, but some of the levels are so hard that it takes a fair amount of strategy and patience to beat them. The pre-teen crowd may find it frustrating and hard &amp; might need some help.<br />3. Each level is different and presents new challenges, this game is never boring or repetitive.<br />4. Nice colorful animation with minimal time spent on advancing the story (you can skip those sections of you prefer).<br />5. There are a lot of forums and blogs you can find on the web if you get stuck and need help.<br />6. There are game helpers called charms and boosters that you can purchase (as low as $0.99) if you like, but they are not necessary to win. I try to challenge myself to pass each level without using them.<br />7. IT'S FREE!!!!<br /><br />Download it now, give it a try, and I dare you to put it down. You won't, so good luck and happy Crushing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|$$$ Strategic and entertaining, challenges makes it interesting to play. It's my way of winding down after a stressful day.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|You just start to have a lot of fun but then money needs to be spent in order to continue. I spent almost $10. getting into the game in a 2-3 hour time frame. I must really suck or the game is money hungry. Sorry to stay it's time to delete.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|This CD/DVD set is highlights from Andrea's concert at Portafino Italy. If you can get the whole concert its great, its was available through PBS in the USA (and shown in theaters all over the world). Its pricy though, so this is you next best thing. The Original concert includes 19 songs while we have 10 hear on the DVD, and 5 on the CD with 4 being the same song's as on the DVD. So 11 Different live songs.<br /><br />THE CD's 10 songs are, five live from the concert and 5 studio recordings. The five live songs are (1). Love in Porafino. (2). Il Nostro Incontro with Chris Botti. (3.) Qualche Strpido Ti Amo with Veronica Barti. (4.) Amema E Core. and (5). Corcovada with Sandy. The Studio songs are (6.) Quizas', Quizas', Quizas', with J LO. Perfida. (7.) Perfidia. (8.) Champagne. (9.) Roma Non Fa La Stupida. and (10). Love Me tender. I am a bit disappointed in the CD. Its very good but we already have the 5 studio songs from the Passione Album. I would of preferred if they put either all live songs on the CD (from the concert), or put a combination of the bonus tracks and leftovers on her from the Passione sessions mixed with the live songs.<br /><br />THE DVD ANDERA BOCELLI LOVE in PORTOFINO is a live concert in a courtyard in beautiful Portofino Italy. It starts with stunning aerial views of the surrounding area with Andrea Bocelli singing Il Nostro Incontro with Chris Botti guesting on the Trumpet, its a very beautiful love long. We see Beautiful Aerial view and view of the wonderful courtyard and surrounding buildings throughout the performance. All the songs hear are songs of romance, and we have songs done in Italian, Neapolitan (an Italian Dialect), Spanish, Portuguese, French and English. The concert starts just before sunset and goes to night, as the night comes all the surrounding buildings are alighted (and some are outlined with white lights) and look wonderful. We also get views of people on boats, looking at their windows at the concert etc., When you see it you will wish you were there.<br /><br />The second song is Senza Fina where Andrea is accompanied by a wonderful accordionist, the Third is a Neapolitan song called Anema E Core a very beautiful song accompanied by Caroline Campbell on Violin. The 4th Song is a very famous Spanish Song called Quizas, Quizas, Quizas which he does on his new Album Passione with Jennifer Lopez but hear he sings it solo with Caroline Campbell on Violin. Caroline proceeds to play to a table in the Audience and two (professional) Dancers get up and dance to the song a very nice touch.<br /><br />Next is (5.) Perfidia a Beautiful Spanish song. Andrea ends it with a long soft beautiful tone. The 6th song is (6.) Champagne. David Foster said that he never heard this song before but its his favorite on the Album and it is just another beautiful song of romance. Lets face it Bocelli can sing twinkle twinkle little star and it would sound great.<br /><br />The 7th song is (7.) Corcovado - Quite Nights of Quite Stars a Beautiful song sung in Portuguese and is one of my favorites, Its just a beautiful smooth smooth song. On the album he sings it with Nelli Futado and hear live, Andrea sings it with a young Adorable Brazilian singer and star named Sandy. She has a very smooth romantic voice and is quite beautiful. Sandy and Bocelli's harmony is just fantastic and there is nice sax work in the song. Song (8.) is a great, fun and romantic Italian song called Roma Non Fa La Stupido Stasera (Rome don't be silly this evening) I never heard this song before and have to say I love it, It is my favorite on the Passione CD. Song (9) is Era Gia Tutto Previsto which is a Italian pop song that sounds more like a beautiful classical song.<br /><br />Song (10) is LOVE IN PORTOFINO which is just a beautiful song and a must do while doing a concert in Portofino. It is a wonderful song one of my favorites. Bocelli nails a beautiful high note to end it. Caroline Campbell also plays Violin ion this one. The concert ends with the song.<br /><br />This is a wonderful concert in a beautiful setting with the worlds greatest singer surrounded by excellent musicians and wonderful guest stars singing some of the worlds most romantic songs and is a must have for any lover of beautiful music. This make a great present/stocking stuffer. But, like I said, if you can get the whole concert.oncert ends with the song.<br /><br />This is a wonderful concert in a beautiful setting with the worlds greatest singer surrounded by excellent musicians and wonderful guest stars singing some of the worlds most romantic songs and is a must have for any lover of beautiful music. This make a great present/stocking stuffer. But, like I said, if you can get the whole concert.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was a very helpful source of information<br />It very informative and helpful it gave me the information I needed
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Saw it on the AppStore, and thought it seemed interesting, and was the Free App of the Day, so that was nice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy this app finally came to the Kindle.  What can I say, it's addictive &amp; fun.  Glad it's here.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Hard to put down&middot;  Love the colorful pictures you create using logic to unlock the pictures. Can't wait for the next scene.
B00AEBBA36|1.0|this movie takes every cliché and stereotype about warfare and manages to pack it into a single, syrupy, utterly fake-seeming package.  Real soldiers (and humans) don't behave like cartoon characters.  I'd recommend watching \\"band of brothers\\" if you want to see what war is really like.
0385537131|5.0|The beginning of 'A Time to Kill' opens with one of the cruelest act that could ever be committed on a fellow human being.  That scene will forever be seared in the minds of anyone who has read it.<br /><br />The ending of 'Sycamore Row' will evoke that exact same emotion.<br /><br />I digress but let me quickly throw this in since I'll get this question five thousand times a day until Christmas.  \\"Is this book really a sequel to 'A Time to Kill'?  It depends on what your definition of \\"sequel\\" is.  If to you a sequel is a book that includes the same characters as the previous book, then yes.  If to you a sequel is a book that continues on the same storyline as the previous book, then no.  There are references to Carl Lee and \\"that verdict\\" but not enough (in my opinion) to call it a continuation of the storyline in 'A Time to Kill'.<br /><br />I know that's splitting hairs and to be honest... it really doesn't matter.<br /><br />'Sycamore Row' is a GRAND SLAM in the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded, last game of the Series, off a pitcher that, up to that point, has thrown a perfect game.  If you think I'm exaggerating I would love to chat with you after you've read this book.  Seriously.  I'm an unapologetic fan of Grisham and while I think he is a magnificent writer, I'm under no illusion that everything he writes is gold.  (*Ahem*, 'The Last Juror', 'The Racketeer').  But there are the gold ones like 'The Broker', 'The Confession', 'A Time To Kill'...<br /><br />And now 'Sycamore Row'.<br /><br />This story centers around a colorful old man named of Seth Hubbard.  Seth is old.  Seth is dying.  Seth is rich. Unfortunately the rich part is the one that draws the attention of everyone.  Even if said rich is only speculative, and not yet proven.  Seth is a shrewd yet successful business man with a plan that, on the surface, looks like he's lost his damn mind. He kills himself, leaves behind a new will that cuts out his children and bequeaths 90% of his estate to the Black maid.<br /><br />A white man in the Deep South leaving the bulk of his rumored riches to his Black hired help... yeah, can't see why that would be a problem.  Although the will is explicit in its direction and clear in its execution, you know it'll be challenged. Why?  Because there hasn't yet been a law written that is above the scrutiny of the mighty and great wisdom of the all-knowing attorney.  And so begins the circus.<br /><br />We do have the pleasure of witnessing the antics of Harry Rex and beloved Lucien once again. These guys. I swear, there isn't enough alcohol in Ireland to sate those two. Despite their quest to become the reincarnation of 'Bartles & James', Ford County would be one hell of a boring place without them. And Jake would be lost.<br /><br />Ah yes Jake.  Life hasn't gone exactly as our brave lawyer hoped.  Of course he did try a double murder case for only $900, so I'm not sure what he expected from good ole' Ford County.  He's brought into this battle courtesy a mailed letter from Mr. Hubbard himself.  Now contesting a will does seem dull and boring, and I'm sure in real life it is.  But in the hands of John Grisham, following all this mess is pure joy.<br /><br />Lettie Lang is the Black housekeeper who is the heir to this (potential) windfall.  And because of such the leeches and distant family have all shown up to \\"help her through this rough and difficult time\\".  Not only that, but she doesn't heed the advice of Jake and surrounds herself with one of the most jerk-off character I've had the pleasure of reading in a Grisham novel.  I'll only say he's a lawyer from Memphis, TN and I was literally laughing out loud at this clown.  Think of it like this... what if Al Sharpton had an entourage?<br /><br />A good writer tells you about the interaction between characters.  A great writer makes you feel the interaction between the characters.  I wasn't sure if I liked Judge Atlee or not.  At times I was cheering, other times I was foundmyself using words that I specifically invented for that lawyer clown from Memphis.  I wanted to hug Dell and ask her if she's make me some shrimp-n-grits while bumping that ample derriere against me.  My respect for Sheriff Ozzie grew and my distain for Seth's \\"family\\" only grew.  And by \\"grew\\" I mean \\"like cancer\\".<br /><br />The last time I felt such hatred and bile for a person(s) was Travis Boyette in 'The Confession'.  And unless your father's name is Lucifer, you will too.  Remember how I said a great writer will make you feel the interaction between the characters?  With the loathing I had for this family, I felt that interaction between those characters and ME!  His offspring are probably the only people who could make a suicide (by hanging no less) feel like a bloody escape.<br /><br />Now... I'm going to warn you that there are two parts in this book that will make you pause.  (Don't worry no spoilers here.).  The first is an incident that involves Lattie Lang's husband.  The father of the family he affects comes to speak to Jake and that conversation... if your eyes don't get a little bit wet then you have a heart of pure concrete.<br /><br />The second part I alluded to earlier is the ending.  'A Time to Kill' has one of the most disturbing openings you'll read.  'Sycamore Row' has one of the most disturbing endings.  The more you read the faster your heart beats. And the faster your heart beats the more you read.  As you read this book you wonder \\"what does this have to do with that?\\", \\"what is the significance of that?\\"  And then it hits you... right in the gut.<br /><br />Hard.<br /><br />'Sycamore Row' is history.  'Sycamore Row' is symbolic. 'Sycamore Row' is a place of pain.  'Sycamore Row' is a place of beauty. 'Sycamore Row' is one of the best books I've read this year.<br /><br />*Personal note: John Grisham has had a few give-a-ways and contests with this new book of his.  I entered but I didn't win.  (No surprise there if you're familiar with my luck)  You know what I wish John would do?  I wish he would have a contest and then the winner(s) of the contest get to come to his house, sit on the porch, drink sweet (very sweet) iced tea, snack on boiled peanuts, and just listen to John tell stories.  I've said this before but John has that old school, old soul, old traditional Southern way of telling stories.  And it translates perfectly to paper.<br /><br />Google Hangouts and FB question and answer sessions are great ways to connect us with our favorite writers.  But imagine... just imagine a weekend in Mississippi immersed in the Southern culture, shooting the breeze on a slow Saturday afternoon with one of the most engaging storytellers writing today.  THAT would be something.  OK enough mindless meanderings from a book lover, back to your regularly scheduled life.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just put it on my kindle first time it locked up but has been good since. been waiting so long for amazon to get it.
B00F87ZUYG|2.0|One episode in. More exploding heads. More nihilism. Characters as undeveloped as a pre-teen girl. The governor is still out there...and if he's as bad as it gets it can't get much worse.<br /><br />The acting in this show, with a few exceptions. Phew. Just abysmal.<br /><br />I'm at the point where I just want the walkers to chew on the thespians who chew on the scenery
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|Have uninstalled. There is no gradual learning. I am just not that smart which means I REALLY need a brain trainer.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's fun for free. I like to play games over again. But if you are looking for new levels, you either have to pay or earn free points.
B00ELCZSS2|4.0|It's a solid album throughout, not just the hits. I can't get enough of Goodness Gracious. Plenty of pop and upbeat songs and ballads.
B006HL9G10|4.0|I use Insight Timer for Tai Chi standing meditation, seated meditation, centering prayer, and just shifting from different emphasis in prayer. I love the bells and the  app is versatile and pretty easy to use. It also has a good collection of guided meditation, and you can ask to have your own guided meditations added. You can also join groups with common meditation interests or start your own.<br /><br />I would like the statistics to be able to separate out the time I spend in different meditations based on my presets. I would also like more clear instructions and adding friends.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love the display of calculations- Easy to use, very intuitive. This is the best replacement for standard calculators. Thank you!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Pretty good game. Easy to follow. Love the little puzzles it has u do. You do not have to use much energy to explore rooms.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual I was hooked immediately, couldn't put it down. And when I got within the last one hundred pages not even sleep was void of \\"what happens next.\\" If you like Stephen King, don't miss this one. FAN-TASTIC!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My adult daughter introduced us to this game after having played in college.  It is quite entertaining and very well designed. There are many small game pieces that could be easily lost.  Definitely not recommended for young kids.  Compared to most board games it is complex to learn so I would suggest playing with someone who already knows the game the first time or two.<br /><br />I think one of the greatest features of this game is that the hexagonal pieces that form the playing surface are put in different places every game making each game unique.<br /><br />It is also well designed to proceed to an end in a reasonable period of time.  No all night sessions like certain other board games.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Beautifully written and paced. Not real scary, there was a bit too much ironic distance. However, I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Nicely fleshed characters, perhaps one thing missing here for the true horror fan is that all of them were either Good or Bad. There weren't any shades of gray except perhaps for the Evil and Undead fading in and out.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to play. It is addictive. I play almost every day. There are so many levels and ways to crush candy.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|Love this game. Problems with new update. What is up with it? Hope you fix it soon. Would hats to give it up.
1118156315|5.0|This was a breakthrough book for me.  I love the illustrations and they compelled me to do the exercises, which is where all of value is created on a personal level (for me anyway).  If you're looking to truly understand yourself professionally, this is the book to read.<br /><br />P.S.  While I loved this book (truly loved it!), I was also a fan of the original Business Model Canvas book that had a similar framework.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I got this game I was so happy I sang three hip hop song. This is what there called berzerk gangnam style and party rock anthem.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This was a very goood movie it had a very descent review to it and it was very educational for the taking...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy this game, but its yet another nag your friends and micro-transact yourself to death game.<br />Fine if you need a 5 minute distraction a couple times a day.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|The way Mr. Pink tells his story and relates key concepts really sticks with me.  His writing style is easy to consume but not mundane.  If you want to connect with others and inspire them on a deeper level, this is a great book that is also fun to read.
B008Q07GLW|5.0|Paul Newman, Robert Redford, action, adventure, witty dialogue, a great ending, and a catchy soundtrack.  One of my all time favorite films.
0670024856|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has written a quietly vibrant epic novel that captured my heart. I love how she presents the natural world as a treasure to be discovered, and how that very discovery creates awe, contentment, curiosity and adventure. Her writing is gorgeous and perfectly suits the time period and her characters, pulling the reader along with gentle intrigue. I won't forget this novel any time soon, and I only wish my Grandmother could read it after me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am not only pleased with the season story line but, I must say Amazon streaming is flawless. I used a different provider for season 1 and 2 and wish I had tried Amazon first, who is now my preferred provider. WELL DONE Amazon.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|You soon forget that these are actors, you'll be so involved in the story. Excellent writing, acting, directing, production. If I knew other technical terms, I'd add them! You'll be hooked.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Ok. Just to start off, I am a HUGE Veronica Roth fan. My friend and I have tried relentlessly to get our other friends to read Divergent. Reading this book, I REALLY wish that I didn't even START reading the series, but, boredom in Taos when your family is on a ski trip miles away from your friends who have \\"other plans\\" can't be helped.<br /><br />So, I have been amazingly excited for this book.<br /><br />The plot (at the beginning)was the same sort of thing as the other books in the series. The \\"perfect\\" faction system is being disrupted by something/one, and it needs to be fixed. In the first book, it was Jeanine Matthews who was the criminal. In the second, it was the huge number of Dauntless traitors and the Erudite. In this one, well, I'm not saying anything.<br /><br />I was fascinated with the idea of telling some of the story from Tobias's point of view at the beginning, but when I got to the end of the book, I can see why it was necessary. Another thing that I was intrigued by was Tris's mother's backstory. I thought that it was well- written, and it had some things in it that I didn't even expect. I mean, yeah, just before it was revealed, I saw it coming, but it answered questions that I don't think that ANYONE would think of asking.<br /><br />The main attraction for me, as a 14 year-old girl, was the love story. My best friend in the entire universe (a.k.a the girl who introduced me to this series) would just call me crazy. She really doesn't like love stories. Anyway, the love story was really good in this book, but it does get a little bit mature at one point. There wasn't much detail put in it (thank goodness), but, I definitely would not recommend that children 11 and younger should read that scene. There was also a LOT more kissing in this book than in the others (*giggling because I am NOT telling my best friend about that, and I'm going to be evil and make her find out on her own*), which I was glad about, considering the end of the book.<br /><br />And now, for the last (and definitely most least that you can get) point I'm going to make. *clears throat and drinks some water* All right, here goes: WHY THE HECK DID YOU DO THAT, VERONICA ROTH??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OHMYGOD, WHY DID I WAIT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME JUST TO HAVE A HUGE FREAKING DISAPPOINTMENT?????!!!!!!!!! I GET THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR BOOK END LIKE EVERY OTHER YA ROMANCE OUT THERE, BUT STILL, WHY COULDN'T YOU END IT WITH A BREAKUP???? DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS DIE??? DID YOU HAVE TO??? BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THE FREAKING POINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Meltdown complete.<br />The ONLY reason that I gave this book a 2 star rating was because the love story was interesting.<br />And now, for the last (and definitely most least that you can get) point I'm going to make. *clears throat and drinks some water* All right, here goes: WHY THE HECK DID YOU DO THAT, VERONICA ROTH??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|There musical talent of Lindsey Stirling is unreal and unprecedented. With a variety of song choices each this its own unique qualities, &#34;Lindsey Stirling&#34; makes a wonderful album. The pieces are beautiful and elegant yet have added flair from the usually stereotypical &#34;classical&#34; sound. Lindsey Stirling does an excellent job in using different genes and playing them on a violin to get the best of both sounds. In short, a work of art that is elegant; yet, has different genes infused sounds to make it an amazing album for all types of music lovers.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is the perfect calculator for me.  It has a large display which is easy to understand and easy on the eyes.  It has the basic functions that a person needs daily and does not have a bunch of functions that are completely unnecessary and useless.  This is a great app.  I have it on my phone and my kindle.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I really love this Britney CD. It's feminine, the tunes are extremely addicting and I feel this album is very personal compared to her other albums.
B005XUC398|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie- the cast was good, story line believable, and of course the 1080P on the Roku box gave a great picture quality. The ending was kind of meh.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Suspenseful, well written and quite possibly taking place right under our noses. The penetration of Al Queda is a reality.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Just as great as season three. However, in-depth look into Calinda's past was an unwelcome story arc. Looking forward to season five.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was the perfect value. I would say this book is intriguing and exciting in every way possible. Bought it for my Kindle and am glad to have this book for life.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|I watched this on ROKU in HD - great quality & always an excellent movie to watch - excellent cast & story line
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Life's story about relationships, conflicts, and solutions. A good movie for teenages to watch and discuss. It was well done .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally available on the kindle. Works great and runs smoothly. Would definitely recommend. Gave it five stars because it never crashes!
B00899F0G8|5.0|This review is for the newbies who haven't started from season 1. Yes, I love PLL. This season was great; but do not start from the middle season! Otherwise, yes, buy this!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Good game, addictive and fun to play with my daughter. I want to get the other puzzles. I can't get enough. Now unlock the bonus level!
0811879542|5.0|Per a recommendation from Amazon, I bought this &#34;board book&#34; with no major expectations.  Needless to say, it exceeded them. The story offers the opportunity to explore multiple concepts: i.e., left and right, up and down, large and small, as well as mixing primary colors.  I found it was fun to read, and laughed out loud as I shook the book and made it come to life!  My only complaint is that the cover is a &#34;board book&#34; cover, but the pages are not.  The paper quality is good, although I intended it to be handled by little ones who don't always get what being gentle means.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Amazing!! If you haven't watched this movie yet you are not from this world. Just a great movie. Thanks Stan Lee!
B00ET47USI|2.0|Game is fun but too often won't download or freezes up Kindle completely. Not worth the effort in my opinion.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Great price and received right away. Credit card discount helped me get for free. It was an awesome deal for sure.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|GOod!
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|Every episode is funny and I look forward to watching each episode. I haven't seen an episode I didn't like yet! If only there were more shows this good.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|i would`ve given it another star ..it`s wonderful!i`ve already recommended it to friends ....you ask for too much.;it could discourage replying to this request... MAKE IT SIMPLER... GET MORE FEEDBACK
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Finally a game that isn't just a stand there and shoot targets as they pop up. It actually flows through a story line campaign. Worth the money
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I first read this book when I was a teenager, and re-read it several times.  After about 40 years I decided to look at it again and  I am enjoying it just as much, a wonderful story with unforgettable characters.  It doesn't hurt to have the image of Laurence Olivier from the film in my mind either.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This was a light fluffy book which lacked most literary elements. But it developed some interesting characters. It would be a good sit on the beach with fancy rum drinks for an hour or so kind of book. Not interested in further writings by this author. Not my style
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|The experiments are worth a try, but in conjunction with the method outlined in [[ASIN:B00E3XMR6U Creative Mindshaping: Create A New You. Create A New Life.]] which gave me better results.<br /><br />See what works for you, and you'll be surprised at what your mind can bring about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, I am so hooked on it, Play it all the time. So glad they finally got it for Kindle Fire.  It is bigger easier to see. Most everyone I know is hooked on it.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|I knew a number of NAVY SEALS during my Navy years and have total admiration and respect for each and every one. Adam Brown was one in a million and his story is truly inspiring. The fact that religion helped this man turn his life around is laudable but the author focused so much on religion that I felt it should have been filed under &#34;Christian Inspirational&#34;.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Sometimes I get frustrated and have to put it down for a minute but then it comes to me what to do next! I can get lost in the game for hours on end. Please add more levels.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Don't care for game requiring buying more time if you do get addicted to the rush!! Wrong wrong wrong!!! Will remove game after 24 hours
0393338827|5.0|This is a fun, well-written book about the people who saw through the Sub-Prime Mortgage bull, who knew these &#34;instruments&#34; were over-valued, and who knew that nobody actually understood them. These were people in a position to profit from what they believed to be an inevitable plunge in the value of these bonds by taking a &#34;short&#34; position, essentially gambling that the bond issuers would default. In retrospect, it looks like easy money, and one wonders why more people didn't do the same. The reality is much more interesting.<br /><br />It turns out that swimming against the current of conventional wisdom on Wall Street is a scary business. It takes patience, lots of money, and nerves of steel. In addition, when everything falls apart, the government might step in and &#34;fix&#34; things so that your winning bet doesn't pay off. Meanwhile, nervous investors may bail out on you, if you're gambling with their money. I could really understand how much easier it is to follow the herd.<br /><br />So, read the book, enjoy, and watch for signs of the next bubble.
B007ZB06OW|2.0|I purchased this thinking it was a pre-built display piece.  This a model kit.  It does not come as pictured.  It will take many hours of hard work to make it look like the photos.  The description does not mention that it requires glue and paint.  This model kit seems to be on the intermediate-advanced level.  The instructions are in Japanese only.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|The author shows exceptional talent and ability to write. The erotic parts are the obvious initial attraction but are somewhat overdone. Believe future books may actually be better.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I don't have a television, so occasionally I get into a series online. This is one very few shows that I really love. While I don't usually like themes of Revenge and deceit, this show is so well done that I get immersed in the story enough to not feel like it is all bad. The people are attractive and their lifestyles are luxurious. It is a fun escape from my simple life for 45 minutes.

1846145813|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's latest book continues with the thematic premises of [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]], [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]] and [[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers]], establishing a central theme for the entire book, then presenting multiple stories around that theme. In David and Goliath, the central theme can best be described as, \\"The advantages of disadvantages, and the disadvantages of advantages.\\"<br /><br />Beginning with the story of David and Goliath itself, Gladwell gives us the story of David overcoming the odds to defeat Goliath on the field of battle, and then gives additional information theorizing that David was the more dangerous of the two, and that Goliath may have been even more encumbered with physical ailments that gave David the overwhelming advantage. In this context, the outcome should have been a surprise to noone.<br /><br />Many different stories are told, including the failure of California's Three Strikes Law, small vs. large class size, the failure of the UK in trying to pacify Northern Ireland, the success of positive neighborhood police interaction, and many others. In most cases, two contrasting ideas are presented in a single chapter, as in the Northern Ireland/inner city example. In that case, the success of one police action is contrasted with the catastrophic failure of another.<br /><br />Gladwell's book is, as always, meticulously researched, and the footnotes themselves extend the book by at least 30 pages, by my estimate. His views and conclusions are no doubt controversial, and fly in the face of popular opinion, but he has once again put together a thought-provoking treatise that will make you think twice.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If u are at this point if the series there is really no reason to review because u obviously love the books. They are simply awesome!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very well written entertaining book.  nothing over the top with the kinky sexery...a good read, like watching a rated R movie...so whoever is looking for a good story and a great book, read this trilogy.
1250038820|5.0|Love the Facebook page (I follow that rather than the blog). Love the message. Love the execution.<br /><br />The book does have quite a few new portraits, which was exciting. And the overall quality of the pages, binding, jacket, etc. was great.<br /><br />I hate to knock it for anything, but I have to point out... It seemed to me that the portraits in the book had a much higher ratio of simple captions to interview quotes. For example, on the online Facebook version, there are very few photos that use the simple &#34;Seen in X neighborhood&#34; caption, or a caption of Brandon's own take on the person. What I have always thought sets HONY apart from other portrait art is that the interview quotes allow us to view the subjects through such a raw, human, empathetic lens. I was disappointed that there were fewer quotes and more simple captions in the book.

B002QVZ71I|4.0|a little long but funny. the end is not as good as the first part but overall you could have a fantastic time watching it
B008AIGWVA|1.0|I knew what I was getting into when I downloaded this app,  but I was curious.  I tinkered around with it and got bored real quick.  Thank you to the developers for letting me try this out but it wasn't for me.<br /><br />If you can imagine the original Furbie toy... That got old real quick too, but you couldn't delete it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldn't put these books down!  Great series and fun read.  Highly recommended.  A good clean book for the young teen reader.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|To bad google blocked support streaming of local content, otherwise, it is a great product and I like it a lot.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|It's been 20 years since I first read Sarum. It was thrilling to find that Rutherford was a worthy heir to Michener. This story of Salisbury England starts at the end of the ice age and follows several inter-related families down through the ages to modernity. These fictional people put the historical events outlined into greater focus. A satisfying page turner.
