0439023513|5.0|The next time you write a review, indicate if you're including SPOILERS because you're spoiling it for us who are reading them (the reviews) in order to get the gist of the book itself. Not to find out major PLOT POINTS. Like WHO DIES. Thanks.
B0047O2HJW|5.0|This is a great box set: well packaged, all discs are  flat and have a quiet surface. The mono mix is dynamic and less distracting than the sometimes bizarrely mixed stereo releases.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Dont listen to the clowns that say this album is over rated sorry i dont think so.  This is one of the best albums ever i repeat!  And not because of sympathy for the devil either.  Thats a great song but the other songs are just as great.  I guess if you dont like that outback country rockabilly blues then i guess you wouldnt like this album.  To me though i love this album i love everything about it. The guitars are killer its mostly acoustic and thats great.  The slide guitar is killer too. Now there is a rumour and i dont know how true it is but i heard ry cooder plays the slide guitar on this album instead of brian jones i dont know how true that is though.  Anyways this is a killer album!!!
0316098337|5.0|Room is told in the first person point of view by Jack, who just turned five years old on the day the book opened:  \\"Today I'm five. I was four last night going to sleep in Wardrobe, but when I wake up in Bed in the dark I'm changed to five, abracadabra.\\"<br /><br />Jack lives alone with his mother, and as he is her only companion and source of conversation, he has an advanced vocabulary and conversation skills which are obvious from his narration. Also because his mother (\\"Ma\\") is his only source of information about the world, except for minimal television, his is unusually naive and at times backward for his age. Donoghue does an excellent job giving Jack a voice that is at once believable and emotionally stirring.<br /><br />Through Jack's eyes we view his world: one room and Ma. He narrates an average day (though a bit different as it's his birthday) for the reader, not realizing that there is anything unusual about the way his days play out. The reader however, sees what Jack doesn't: that Ma is making enormous sacrifices to keep Jack's world as \\"normal\\" as possible.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it by telling much of the plot, beyond what might be read on the blurb, but I will say that reading this I am reminded of Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful, in that a parent is making enormous sacrifices that the child never sees, and is able to live somewhat normally and happily as a result.<br /><br />Room is five chapters, but essentially three parts. First, Jack gives a picture of daily life. Heartbreaking for the reader, matter of fact for him, as he tells about the things he and Ma do during an average day. Without realizing it, he shows Ma as a woman struggling with mental illness, doing the best she can to hold it together for her son, while he is an exuberant, generally happy, nearly typical five year old, doing five year old things.<br /><br />The second part of the book is when Jack and Ma leave Room for Outside. This is very traumatic for them both, in differing ways. Jack has never been Outside or seen other people and the sensory overload is well told in his voice, as is Ma's attempts to stay mentally strong while suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome--though through his eyes the experience looks quite different.<br /><br />The last part of the book is the triumphant finale. It is again beautifully told through Jack's voice as he and Ma succeed in be \\"scrave\\" (brave even though scared) and life begins fresh for them.<br /><br />I have seen many negative comments, written about such trifling things, that I was shocked. Room is the most fantastic book I have read in some time; definitely the best I've read in 2011, but possibly the best I've read in 2010 as well. It is heartbreaking at times, yes, but it is also such a hopeful book, a book of triumph and love. I highly recommend this stirring and powerful novel.Outside or seen other people and the sensory overload is well told in his voice, as is Ma's attempts to stay mentally strong while suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome--though through his eyes the experience looks quite different.

B001TW69J4|5.0|This some straight up pure in your face metal guitar playing its great.  The whole album is instrumental and every track is great tosin abasi is a great guitar player he plays a eight string ibanez and it sounds great. I think its amazing playing a eight string guitar. Buy this right now.
1402217722|2.0|I'm really disappointed in this book. It's all over the place.  I do like (enjoy) the Earl Rule very much. Horry is very annoying and idioctic.  The story has yet to grab me.  I'm waiting for \\"it\\" to happen and \\"it\\" has not happened.  Not sure where the humor is that the other reviewers have mentioned.
1416972250|3.0|I enjoyed reading the first book, \\"City of Bones\\", and thought it had potential. The second book, \\"City of Ashes\\", was interesting enough for me to get this third installment.<br /><br />It didn't really live up to my expectations (which weren't that high in the first place).<br /><br />I found myself thinking every ten pages with a groan, \\"Am I done yet?\\" I'm all for multiple point of views and switching up the scenery but I felt like once I adjusted to a scene with Clary and her problems then it would just abruptly end and pick up with Simon's predicament then cliffhangered off to yet another scene. There was too much going on individually for me that I got frustrated.<br /><br />Something that is really important to me when I'm reading is a connection with the main character. I didn't feel that with Clary. In fact, I don't think I really know what her personality is like. The girl is described as someone who is stubborn with a temper but maybe I was too annoyed with the length of the book or distracted by the angst flinging everywhere to notice.<br /><br />I also felt like Max's death was a huge waste of space and words. What does it accomplish except for everyone feeling bad about themselves? Why would Sebastian kill Max and not Isabelle? You could have cut out Max's existence entirely and the story would have gone along fine.<br /><br />And what is a 9-year-old kid reading Angel Sanctuary? Cassandra Clare, you do realize the manga portrays an actual incestuous relationship?<br /><br />I DID like how we get more of the background of Shadowhunter history and the angels' involvement. The original twists on biblical themes and the Jace's sarcastic comments are probably the only reasons why I'll continue reading the sequels-but I'm in no hurry.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|I waited on this book with great hopes that it would be fabulous and it was! Great twists and turns. Kept me interested the whole book. Caught myself speed reading just to find out what happened next.
B002HNA95E|4.0|With the exception of the Hard Candy song, this is a collection of strong records. Madonna's Celebration is a well-culled together collection that dresses in really sexy heels -- she's the ideal! Zipping along through these songs creates a passion and love for those Madonna moments in my life! The cover art, however, is sub-par which surprised me. Typically Madonna has a sharper eye for detail than this. Perhaps she was a bit distracted in the tracking and approving of this particular project? No matter, give this album a spin and bypass the lackluster song. Dane and Sing, Get Up And Do Your Thing!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|I heard Annie sing on a late nite show and fell in love with the way you heard the music (the actual instruments), her beautiful voice, and the way she pronounced every word so that you could understand them.  I figured my mom would like it and she called it \\"magnificent.\\"  I like it also and feel that it will take you into a Christmas mood at anytime of year.  It includes some of the classics and a couple songs in other languages to which I could not recognize the words.  Overall, I highly recommend this.  Its so refreshing to hear the songs and the words and the music with such great elocution.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|sequal to the best book ever. making this the 2nd coolest book ever written. deffinatly worth the money. i still would have bought it if it were23465789087654456786576542345678998675334568767892345678909867523456898765456789097865447890 dollars.
0375842381|2.0|We started this trilogy with the audio version of The Golden Compass, stopping it here and there to discuss the Skraelings or to grab a map--especially National Geographic's old Peoples of the Arctic map.  The story is shaded, layered, inventive, and wholly delightful right up until that ghastly sacrifice.  I had some secret hope the book would end better.  It doesn't.      Book Two, The Subtle Knife, is neither sharp nor subtle.  Instead of layers of story with ever-shifting tensions, it has clashing images that leave the more thoughtful readers saying \\"Wait, what?\\"  Lyra is a different and much less interesting girl in this book.  A boy named Will takes the lead in the story.  Will has no mischief in his soul, and his grim outlook smothers any chance of Lyra finding a bit of amusement.  This whole book should have been twenty to fifty pages long.  My sons are gluttonous readers.  Only one of them finally struggled through this book, saying he hoped #3 would be better.      Book Three, The Amber Spyglass, has some haunting images but on the whole is impossible to enjoy.  A new character named Mary is really no more than a plot device; if I were the editor, her entire contribution to this story would have taken up less than three full pages.  Worse, the author used this book to hammer his atheist agenda down the reader's throat.  The children find that the souls of the dead are imprisoned and tormented, and that every religion preaching otherwise is simply a lie.  I don't mind children being exposed to alternative paradigms of reality, and I think teens should be exposed to a variety of religious outlooks.  This book does not open doors to other ways, however; what it does is slam doors by saying that religion is only for deluded fools and the tyrants who control them.
1580812201|5.0|This is an amazing recording of a heartbreaking play. All the parts are well cast, and listening to them as they go about an extraordinary ordinary day in their lives brought home farm life to me. I did cry as Starbuck taught Lizzie how to be noticed and pretty, and wanted to hurt Noah for hurting Lizzie. That is the power of this play, what it gets you to feel. Led by Jayne Atkinson as Lizzie, the cast steps up to an amazing text and brings it to life so well. I wish that I could go back in time and see this live.
030746363X|4.0|The author has obviously researched his topics well and extremely thoroughly. The material is put across in a very sassy, in your face way ( I could have done without the language). Lots of great information and ways to practically implement the theories. I would recommend this to people who like to think about traditional topics in a new and innovative way. Great read, but don't leave it on the shelf!
0307474712|5.0|I really loved this book and felt very connected to the characters. Couldn't put it down, but , at the same time, didn't want it to be over.  I know that the male character was not charming and someone you would love, but that didn't matter because it was the female character who had to love him...good or bad, and she did.  One Day was beautifully written,funny, sad, a wonderful love story. I look forward to reading other books by David Nicholls.
B000PWQPAC|2.0|I am a huge fan of the GITS series, but when I purchased this DVD I encountered a gread deal of digital interference, leading eventually to an unplayable disk approx. 10 minutes into the film.  No system is perfect, I figure, so I chalk it up to a defective copy and order a replacement.  What do I find?  Same problem, just 30 minutes into the film instead of 10.  From what I saw, the story is great and the animation is excellent; overall, an excellent addition to the series.  Thus, it would get 5 stars, but two DVDs (both purchased new) that are unplayable drops it down (even only seeing 30 minutes of it, it doesn't deserve a 1 star rating, to hell if I didn't get to see the entire movie).
B002ZG97E2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! It is so funny, I laugh my butt off every time I watch it.  Great for all ages :)
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is the first movie we took our daughter to see at the \\"big theatre.\\"  I couldn't believe she sat all the way through it and talked about it all the way home!  The music is fantastic, even my husband likes this movie!  Of course, we had to buy it just as soon as it came out on DVD!!!
B004AKCME8|5.0|My daughter loved this movie!  I also found it enjoyable and entertaining.  Definitely a movie you could watch again and again.  The animation is absolutely  beautiful.  Highly recommended.
0385738757|5.0|I think that I liked this book better then the first one. For starters, i like Brenda and Jorge as new editions to the Gladers pack. Those Cranks were so scary and really left me on edge. Im wondering what WICKED really did have control of during the trials and what just happened spontanuosly. I was a little upset that random people were dying for no reasons and everything going on with Teresa left me heartbroken. I cant wait for the next installment and for all of my questions to be answered. Is WICKED good or bad? Who is Brenda? What is real and not real? and many more...
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond<br /><br />Guns, Germs and Steel as the author Jared Diamond succinctly summarizes it, is about why the rise of complex human societies unfolded differently on different continents over the last 13,000 years.  It's an insightful book that provides well-researched information on how human societies evolved and in doing so provides compelling evidence against racially based theories of human history.  This award winning book is 480 pages long and is composed of the following four major parts: 1. From Eden to Cajamarca, 2. The Rise and Spread of Food Production, 3. From Food to Guns, Germs, and Steel, and 4.  Around the World in Five Chapters.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />1. Award winning Pulitzer Prize book that lives up to all the accolades that it has received.<br />2. Well-written, well-researched, and most importantly the ability to convey findings in a lucid manner for all to enjoy and learn from.<br />3. As a result of the books compelling arguments, its findings has dismantled racially based theories.  Bravo!<br />4. The book provides theories that can and have been applied to better understand other fields, namely economics.<br />5. Provides compelling information on how Europe dominated the New World.<br />6. Provides a grand unifying theory that explains how societies evolved over the past 13,000 years.<br />7. This book doesn't answer all the questions to a satisfying conclusion but it certainly will inspire others (and it already has) to take the mantle from Mr. Diamond and get there.  Sometimes the greatest books are not the ones that give you all the answers but provides you the inspiration to seek them for yourself.<br />8. Tables and illustrations that add value.<br />9. Fascinating histories about the domestication of plants and animals.<br />10. Geography, geography and geography.<br />11. Germs as the ultimate weapons.<br />12. Writing systems that helps put the puzzle together.<br />13. Kleptocrats...and the use of religions to justify their power.<br />14. It takes you to societies we know so little about.  Thank you.<br />15. Ambitious book that exceeded my expectations.<br />16. Thought-provoking, great scholarly work that will be referenced for years to come.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1. With an ambitious unifying theory as Mr. Diamond espouses, there will be elements of it that are not satisfying to some critics.  However, from my view point the work of this book in many aspects are groundbreaking and should inspire further research and discussion.<br />2. It can be repetitive at times but understandably so.<br />3. Some arguments are more speculative than others.<br />4. I think the author does go out of his way to be politically correct.<br /><br />In summary, This book is anthropology at its best.  It's an inspiring, ground-breaking book that makes compelling arguments on the evolution of societies.  Does it answers all the questions to our satisfaction?  No, but it lays the groundwork for future research.  Mr. Diamond must be commended for a major contribution to history.  This is a must read book. It will require an investment of time but you will be rewarded with wisdom .<br /><br />Further recommendations, even books that may go against specific elements of Mr. Diamond's position: \\"10,000 Year Explosion...\\" by Cochran and Harpending, and \\"Before the Dawn...\\" by Nicholas Wade.he use of religions to justify their power.<br />14.

B001CEE1YE|5.0|For long detailed reviews look elsewhere.. clean picture quality and sound is awesome. Matrix as a movie is one of the best trilogy ever IMO.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|this is a pretty good movie. Angelina Jolie is excellent in this movie. she is awesome. this movie is packed with action from begining to end. This is a great movie. hope they make a sequel
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This is a TRULY GREAT movie and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than the original for a # of reasons: 1. Sarah Butler is WAAAAAAAAAAAY HOTTER than Camille Keaton, 2. The acting in this, unlike the original was excellent and believable, 3. The camera shots were so much better, 4. There was actually a score in this movie which was moody and unsettling in a good way, and 5. When you ad up the first 4 elements I have listed here it actually makes it feel like a horror movie unlike the first.  Some of the night shots and sound fx reminded me very much of the Strangers, another good un'.  Butler was also MUCH MORE CONVINCING & SCARY than Keaton.  This movie obviously had A LOT more thought put into it than the original, which I give ZERO stars to.  BUY THE REMAKE TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|after seeing this movie i don't think i want to go into another elevator, just kidding. This movie was well made. this is a pretty good movie. This movie is the first in the Night Chronicals. i hope the others are just as good. The actors in this movie were outstanding. All in all this was an excellent movie.
159562015X|4.0|The book arrived a tid bit late and the cover was ripped.  If they took a little more care in packaging the product, it would have been perfect.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|see review above about loreena.  she is one of the foremost talents in the world today.  no one can compare to her style.
B0042U94UQ|1.0|We just happen to have 3 little girls who were all adopted at older ages, 2 from an orphanage, one from Foster Care. We were totally blindsided by this movie, having no idea what it was about.  We didn't go to see it, but were in a group where it was shown..... it was one of those \\"caught off guard\\" moments.  While we don't choose to overly protect our children, there are some things that are just best unseen. This would be one of them.    The situation of the 3 little girls being put in the box of shame made me cringe.  The idea of them being SENT BACK, which actually HAPPENED to one of our girls.... the whole idea of them being so mistreated made me so sad. :(  One of our girls got up during the movie and came and sat next to us.  (She had been in the front with her friends)    We talked a little about it after our event was over, and it was hard for them to process it.  How do you laugh about a box of shame? How do you laugh at a man who is going to USE children for Crime?      Yes it is silly, and meant to be silly, but there is nothing silly about children and adoption and pain..... some things just shouldn't be made fun of.    The other part that bugged me was that, while he changed his mind about the children, he never redeemed himself from his life of crime...... so, frankly, I thought the movie was Amoral Drivel and I hope it never comes up again, as I don't want to explain it to anybody else. Maybe I'll just send them here to my review. :)  I gave it 1 star because it is required to get at least one.
B003OWVHVC|5.0|I have never written a review for any album that i have purchased, but i was very compelled to do one for \\"Good Things.\\" This album was just incredible. From beginning to end there are no fast forwards only repeats. My fav's include \\"green lights\\", \\"loving you is killing me\\" and \\"femme fatale.\\" Love this album!!! Its going to live in my cd player forever!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I ordered The Pacific and I received the mini-series in two days in excellent condition.  I am very impressed with the condition it was in and the speed of which it came to me.  I have not finished the series yet, however, so far all of the disks work.  The mini-series is a great watch and is another great chapter of World War II.  Instead of the Western Front, this takes place in the Pacific, as the name implies, and unlike Band of Brothers, The Pacific follows Marines instead of Army Airborne Parachuters.  I highly recommend getting both The Pacific and Band of Brothers if you want a good story on brotherhood, companionship, action, drama, adventure, and an idea on what it was like for the generation of men who fought in World War II.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|its a great movie! i love it! the movie is about Carl Fredricksen, the elderly man on the cover and a young Wilderness Explorer Russell and their adventure to Paradise falls. the journey takes them through the wilderness of south america in which they meet some interesting characters along the way. the story is both touching and humorous, especially when they meet Doug the dog; i wont spoil it for you but this is great fun to watch with the family.
B000068PQ0|4.0|The Flaming Lips incorporate electronic and acoustic elements to create a sound that is quirky, unique, and memorable.  Lyrically, this album evokes themes of love, death, beauty, and the significance of what it means to be human.  While the music can occasionally become murky, generally the Lips do a masterful job balancing disparate instrumental styles into a blend that at times is reminiscent of early David Bowie or Pink Floyd.  While it is an acquired taste perhaps, it is worth a listen or two for those who have grown weary of the pablum formula rock that is all too prevalent on the radio today.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|First of all WOW...I have purchased many soundtracks, but this one is one of the best! The music is so interesting and different that you are drawn to it. The sound is a mix of 80's tones with little blirps of 80s video game sounds. I don't know what it is about these tracks, but when I first watched this movie, the music just draws you in as if you are there. Amazing.
B004CLYKLI|3.0|I bought this book to see what all the hype was about. It is a good, effortless read. While basically Amy Chuan raises a good point (kids should know how to fight for what they wish to attain and not be over-indulged), her personality makes it difficult to appreciate the approach. There is no denying that she is candid enough about her relationship with her daughters, and does not try to sound or look good. However, she most of the time simply sounds manic, hysterical and unbalanced, to the point that it seems a miracle that her husband (and daughters) could put up with her for so long. She must have redeeming qualities... but they don't appear in the book. Can you imagine such a lady as a prospective mother-in-law ?... Good luck.    I can't help wondering what her poor daughters will have to live with now - not even because of their education, but because of the after-ripples of the book. They will be watched and commented on at large now. Whenever they perform well, it will be deemed normal, but if they underperform, they will just be laughed at - and I'm not even talking about the internet abuse which can be seen already on the web. These girls bring Chelsea Clinton to mind, who was branded a \\"celebrity\\" and could never fade into anonymity or stand for herself while she was at college. Poor girls.

1580176941|4.0|This book was helpful for inspiration on what to do with decorating cookies.  It's got several pages of color photographs and step-by-step decorating instructions to achieve the looks that are shown in the book.      I've tried two of the cookie recipes and they are alright - the roll out cookie recipe that they provide really does roll out quickly and nicely but the flavor isn't anything to write home about.  They were better after being iced and setting in the fridge overnight for the icing flavor to mix with the cookie.      The royal icing recipe in the book is a good one.  I used it in conjunction with a corn syrup icing recipe that I already have and it worked well to pipe fine details on the cookies after the corn syrup icing had set up.      There are some good tips about all aspects of cookie crafting - from rolling out dough between two sheets of waxed paper to applying pre-baked decorations.
B004K00NMG|5.0|Until Nemo, Cars, Bugs life etc I didn't really watch this type of movie.  Since then I have gone back to watch several animated movies, this is one of the best I have seen.  The music is perfect as is the story-line. It is a film for all ages. Can't wait to see what it looks like on Blu-ray
B001N26GFC|4.0|We have had discussions about whether this is one of the best movies around or one of the worst.  But whatever it is, I can't think of many movies that we will randomly start quoting especially when I am not paying attention while driving. Don't want to oversell it but just about the time that you think that it is just a story about an overly caffeinated, funny, little flake, Poppy shows a depth/compassion as she relates to a student that just takes your breath away. Buy it...
B001NFU5WE|1.0|I purchased this for no reason other than it was the lowest cost blu-ray of the movie. My rating does not reflect the movie as its by far one of the best gripping comic book movies of all time, but rather the quality of the picture. I have a sony BR player and a 65\\" hd 3d tv. I have Avatar and Alice in wonderland on it so i know how gorgeous a BR can look on my system, along with HD tv channels. I bought this because i was such a big fan of the movie and wanted an HD copy on disk. I was severely let down when i popped this in. The definition is about dvd quality. The rendering is so bad it because pix-elated throughout the movie, especially in blacks, which it most of the movie. That with the added awkwardness of the case, i would tell you to buy another edition.
B003QCCS36|3.0|Having owned all of Ray's previous albums, I found this one just a bit disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, there are some great things about this album- Ray's voice bleeding through the speakers, the different genre's on display.  But for all the talent on this album, I just can't get into it.  Good music, it just doesn't do it for me this go round.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|loved the movie and couldn't resist the cd.....charming music, romantic, uplifting, and my favorite, teeny yellow polka dot bikini in French!  Hated that song, love it on this track. A song by Josephine Baker, then The Wedding Samba, which has one dancing involuntarily. Unexpectedly - Old Cape Cod (yes, the old song by Patti Page). An interesting mix of music - a gentle roller coaster of emotion.  Having a blue day?  Play this!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|'Australia' is to be looked at as the story of Australia, as Gone With the Wind is a story of America.  Major factors shaping this continent nation have been the outback with its huge sheep and cattle stations, and WW2 when a Japanese invation was a serious threat. So, if much of the movie resembles a western what's wrong with it? This is Australia and in this movie the melodrama and fantastic scenery are a delight for us old dudes who remember the good old westerns
B00003CXCD|4.0|In the spirit of the love that reigns around Valentine's Day, I watched Roman Holiday, a classic suggested to me in terms of style.  Besides the fact that the film sky-rocketed the &uuml;ber-stylish and lovely Audrey Hepburn's career, it was appealing and refreshing to me watching views of the \\"eternal city\\", in the land of my ancestors, and where I still have not been lucky enough to visit.<br /><br />The chemistry between Hepburn and her co-star Gregory Peck in this film is electric and full of a demure sexual tension that only Hepburn was capable of giving.  She is a true comedian, yet never lets go of that aura of regal style and elegance that was classic of old Hollywood films and which came naturally to her.  The story of a Princess suffocated by her duties and longing for some \\"normal\\" time, spent among ordinary people who have no idea who she is remains the ultimate fairy tale story.  It was quite a story at the time as well, and I remember my mother talking to me about this classic Audrey Hepburn film, which in Argentina was known as \\"La Princesa que quer&iacute;a vivir\\", and which was ostensibly based on England's Princess Margaret story and her love affair with Equerry Peter Townsend.  In a perfectly politically correct statement included in one of the featurettes - \\"Remembering Roman Holiday\\", film producer A.C. Lyles explains how events really just \\"happened\\" like that, but it was never his intention to make a film that would illustrate the time when the present Queen of England's sister decided to put duty before love and chose what it ultimately turned out to be an unhappy life.  Still, in this day and age, and after learning of sad stories like Princess Diana's loveless marriage, one wonders if the pun was not entirely unintended.<br /><br />Whatever the case, the film does not disappoint.  Both Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck offer a picture of physical human perfection - he, tall, dark and handsome; she, also dark, slim and with alabaster skin, and talent that drips off the screen.  The movie was Hepburn's first major starring role and also her first Oscar win, and Peck's request to list her as equally important in the credits next to his name speaks not just of generosity but of the vision necessary to give a true star the recognition she deserved in order to push the film to stardom.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the bonus materials included in this edition of the film, not just the aforementioned \\"Remembering Roman Holiday\\", which tells the story of how the film became a reality, even having to battle against a blacklisted script writer who was accused of Communist sympathizing; but also the one entitled \\"Edith Head - the Paramount years\\", where one can watch exclusive footage of Audrey Hepburn in the designer's costumes, as well as a full background of this award-winning costume designer.  The study of Edith Head has inspired me to watch other Hollywood classics such as Sunset Boulevard and White Christmas.  Roman Holiday, however, invites one into the birth of a new star, someone that, like Royalty's own Princess Diana, is born only once.  Her name was Audrey Hepburn.screen.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I am somewhat of an Austen fanatic, I suppose. I've read P&P, and listened to my audio version repeatedly while driving - enough so that I can catch the audio saying \\"a butler\\" when the text says \\"the butler.\\" I just finished watching the restored version of P&P with all the extras. It is wonderful. Like all films the text has to be translated somewhat, as much of Austen's writing is either narrated, or internal thought processes. So we do not commence with Mrs. Bennet announcing that Netherfield has been let at last. We begin with Darcy and Bingley riding their horses near the Netherfield house, and Bingley asking Darcy if he should take it.  We set up Bingley's impetuosity and his dependence upon Darcy for more considered opinions - not that we do much with it later.  Anyway, it is no wonder that when this 6 hour specacular first appeared on British TV in the 1990s, it became an extraordinarily popular show (it appeared over 6 weeks). The casting is excellent. The production values magnificent and I'll be watching it repeatedly, I expect.<br /><br />I have one thing to note, and not just about this version of the novel. The characters all agree that Jane Bennet is the most beautiful girl around, \\"there can not be two opinions about that\\" but only in the Keira Knightly version of P&P is it true. Here, because  Jane is not the female lead she is never better looking than Elizabeth . Jane is played well and I have no complaint about her actresss, but  I would like to see a Jane Bennet who is better looking than Elizabeth, just as she ought to be if our eyes are to agree with the characters in the film.<br /><br />The production here, and always,  is based around the idea that this is one of the greatest romances in the English language. Perhaps it is. Sex and Money say the producers. The book, however, is about an emerging enlightenment way of looking at life, personified by Elizabeth Bennet, who is a \\"rational creature\\" as she tells Mr. Collins, determined to act in the way that in her opinion will constitute her happiness, as she tells Lady Catherine.  She judges people by the content of their character, rather than their social position, wealth, or connections. And she examines evidence in just the way that we defense lawyers all wish our juries would - seeking the truth, rejecting hearsay, considering each sentence in Darcy's letter, weighing probabilities. None of her enlightened views  - the way of life she is modeling - are featured in any production I have seen. Perhaps we'll have to settle for the greatest romance in the English language - but the book is either so much more than that, or it is the greatest romance because of Elizabeth Bennet's enlightened way of living.n her opinion will constitute her happiness, as she tells Lady Catherine.

B002ZIAC26|4.0|This was a good CD and it arrived within a week of me ordering it. I would buy from this seller again.
0307272702|5.0|The chapter on \\"A Primer on the Regulation of Fat\\" ALONE, makes the book worthwhile.  I found it to be fascinating, informative and persuasive.  I always knew that it couldn't just be \\"calories in/calories out\\" that caused my enormously frustrating inability to lose weight.  A low carb diet might not help me, but at least Taubes provides some provocative questions for scientists to study.
0887431461|5.0|I purchased this for my 4 year old Granddaughter in addition to the \\"Big First Grade Workbook\\" because she was so advanced in her class that she was losing interest and misbehaving in class.  The exercises in the book immediately captured her interest and there are over 320 pages per book so she should be busy for a while! Highly recommended!
0307346617|1.0|The title of this review says enough, please don't look at the reviews and be mis-led as I was, take heed to the 1 star reviews...they're almost ALL spot on.  This book is all hype and just total mind-numbing & boring garbage.  I don't know who gives this a 5 star rating...4 star, or even a 3 star...I am utterly disappointed with this book, and would love to get my money back...ugh, I'm so disgusted!  If you want to read a GREAT book that will keep you hoooked until the very end (in addition to being extremely well written), then check out J.L. Bourne's 'Day by Day Armageddon'!  'Day by Day Armageddon' is still my #1/2 favorite zombie novel!
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This movie is well done, even if it does seem to go a little quickly. I would have liked to have a little more depth to the whole story, but all in all it is a wonderful Jane Austen story. If you are an Austen fan then this movie is great to have for a quick fix. It is only about 1 1/2 hours long so it doesn't require a whole day to enjoy the whole thing like some of the more intricate Austen films.
B000002J1U|5.0|Simply one of the best Led Zeppelin albums. A great buy from one of the greatest rock bands in history.  If I was stuck on an island this would be one of the albums I would choose to take.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With nearly two thousand reviews posted, (all of which I have not read) I find that a lengthy exposition of this story is not needed.  It is wonderfully written, (First Person, Present Tense takes getting used to at first) and compelling in storyline and characters.  I found only one flaw, from my perspective, in the whole plot: young Katniss, the protagonist, has a bit of an advanced vocabulary for a sixteen year old, uneducated girl from what was once a poor mining community.  In First Person Present, we only hear the voice and thoughs of the primary character, hence the entirety of the author's writing needs to be attributed to Katniss Everdeen, the main character.<br /><br />Very enjoyable read and I followed immediately (as did thousands of others) with the next two books in the series.<br /><br />Gordon Ryan

B003O86FMW|4.0|I was not surprised, but a little disappointed that Book Two of this series was primarily a reprise of Book One, The Hunger Games.  I suppose that the advent of yet another life threatening competition needed to occur to reinforce our understanding of the nature of arbitrary government edict.  It was a way for the leader of the government to rid himself of what was becoming a cult idol for the masses.  No spoiler intended for those who want to know more.<br /><br />Again, exceptionally well written with a surprising continuation of a likeable, but unliked character.<br /><br />Gordon Ryan
B003Q6D25K|4.0|The demons are back in this frightening sequel/prequel to the highly successful original.  \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" focuses on Dan (Brian Boland), his wife Kristi (Sprague Grayden), Dan's daughter Ali, and newborn son Hunter.  Kristi's sister Katie was in the original film, and she and her boyfriend Micah appear in part 2 as well.  Their inclusion in this movie serves as a bridge to the events taking place in part 1.      Almost immediately, the supernatural forces converge on young Hunter.  The loyal family dog can sense that something's wrong, as he spends most of his time guarding Hunter's crib. Things begin innocently enough; a few pans falling down, doors being opened, and the pool cleaner climbing out of the pool.  But, as the movie goes along, things get progressively worse.  Soon, Hunter is being held in the air by an unseen force, and Kristi is literally dragged from Hunter's room.  Despite these happenings, Dan is reluctant to admit that anything is wrong.  He even refuses to view footage recorded from his high-priced security system.  Daughter Ali has begun researching ghosts and spirits online with a friend in hopes of finding out about what is going on.    The ending is truly scary and ties things together between parts 1 and 2 very nicely.  It sure looks like a \\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" is in the offing.      I've enjoyed both \\"Paranormal Activity\\" films.  These films rely on psychological terror to scare the viewer, and they succeed very well.  There is a definite terror build-up as the movie goes along, and each time a video camera sequence appears, one can be sure that something scary is going to happen.  I thought part 2 started out a little slow, but as it went along, it definitely gets much scarier.    I recommend \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" to any fans of psychological terror.  The scenes are truly frightening and will leave you spellbound.

B003DZX44I|5.0|I love Beauty and the Beast, and I bought the Platinum Edition when it came out on DVD. I didn't want to get the Diamond Edition at first, thinking it was silly to have two copies of the same thing, but I changed my mind when I watched my mom's copy of the Diamond Edition. The colors are much crisper and cleaner, making the picture more vibrant than the DVD version. I also liked the menu, which was easier to navigate than the DVD menu as far as choosing the theatrical version over the version with the added scene. I haven't watched any of the extras on this version, so I can't comment on those, but the improved picture quality of the movie itself makes this a worthwhile purchase.

1595141979|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better with each passing page! It is hard to believe that I am already halfway through the entire series....Vampire Academy set the stage for the whole series, Frostbite delved into the many relationships in Rose's life, and Shadow Kiss explores these relationships a bit more while at the same time revealing more about what it really means to be \\"Shadow Kissed\\".<br /><br />A Changed Rose ~ Rose changes in this novel drastically.  After seeing her friend murdered by a Strigoi, Rose struggles with being who she was before, which in turn affects other aspects of her life.  One most important is that she sees ghosts now, in particular Mason.  She also has a new \\"power\\" in  which she can sense when Strigoi are near - this comes into play in a very exciting and surprising way!  However, Despite this change in Rose she becomes more secretive from everyone, including Lissa and Dimitri. It is not that she doesn't want to talk to anyone she just doesn't want to burden others and at times even wonders who would support her completely.<br /><br />Rose's Duty as a Guardian ~ Rose has always known that by being a Guardian her best friend and bond-mate, Lisa, is always supposed to come first.  In Shadow Kiss, Rose realizes this even more.  However, Rose's and Lissa's friendship changes a little too. It is put to the test - the question is will it endure.....<br /><br />Rose and Dimitri ~ well.... what can be said about these two.  As always, their relationship is a roller coaster and when I enjoyed fully.  Rose has to find a way to trust in Dimitri with her newfound \\"powers\\" while at the same time they both try to accept the fact that it is best to not be together because of their promised roles as Lissa's Guardians (she must come first, ALWAYS).<br /><br />An End and a New Beginning ~ by the end of the book, the plot twists around completely.  Without giving too much away, all that can be said is that readers will be surprised.  Their dreams about the characters will come true but will also be shattered and surprised.<br /><br />Richelle Mead as the Writer ~ Richelle Mead has yet again created a success.  Her writing style is flawless!  The plot is clearly well thought out and pulls at the heart strings and emotions, setting it apart from other Vampire novels.  Each character is redeveloped in each succeeding installment, shinning new light on their role in Rose's life (as this is about Rose) and their affect in her future.  My goals and dreams for this book were met and well surpassed. I cannot wait to read the next installment Blood Promise.come true but will also be shattered and surprised.

B002RI9HUM|4.0|My first Marian Keyes read so was not sure what to expect. Have heard all the hype and this author definitely lives up to her name. She has a way of making you feel as if you are really living in that world. I was longing for the story to continue and continue and was dreading that last page.  A great read that will have you dying to find out what happens in the end but then wishing it never ended.
B00402FGE4|5.0|I've been a fan of the Stargate franchise ever since it first started with SG-1, so I have to admit this show was a big change from the other two series. I think the slow start is due to the fact that there are a lot more primary characters to learn about, so they had to spend more time telling each character's story. I feel like I just got invested in all the characters and their stories, and have fallen into the flow of the series, and now the are ending it. Apparently, (according to sguawareness.com) at this point fans can still rescue the show by boosting ratings and sales of the DVDs/Blu-ray/digital shows, so tell your friends.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was downright delicious.  I devoured it in two and a half days despite its length.  I won't offer you a summary, there are many reviews with that already.  I want the doubters to know that this is in fact a wonderful book and not just for lovers of history (although that helps!).  My heart pounded with them in tense moments, I gasped at the revelation of some piece of information and some moments (though I am loathe to admit) I actually shouted out loud.  I enjoyed the book so much that I will be promptly reading it again, locked in my apartment with plenty of tea and fantasies of the mysterious Matthew.  It is worth EVERY penny.    This book owes my boyfriend an apology.
0439023521|5.0|My husband and I read this book at the suggestion of our 12 year old daughter and her friend.  It drew us in from the first sentence.

B003ASLJO0|5.0|Theres a moral to this story, a strong moral.  For me, Eastwood is superb.  The supporting cast, whilst not seemingly professional (a lot of them) do what is necessary and needed.  Its the story of a bigot, a racist, a rigid man who doesn't like 'people' probably because of his trauma from the Korean war.  But his heart is touched and he resolves and addresses both his and many others' problems.  Watch it as a film, for entertainment and then, watch it again, and see to underlying message.  Wonderful film, wonder music.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|If you liked the movie as much as my husband and I did, then you will especially appreciate the bonus disk with director's comments on the background of the movie. For average movies, this type of extra content can come across as pretentious and/or boring. In the case of such topical material, executed in such an excellent way in the film itself, it is very interesting to gain this additional perspective on its making. So if you liked the Social Network, then make this investment and enjoy it all over again, with the added bonus of new insights into the material.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|Yes, there is someone crazier than the building-climbing \\"Spiderman,\\" and his name is Phillippe Petit, who will forever be known for his death-defying tightrope walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974.  He didn't simply walk; over the course of eight crossings, he knelt, lay, saluted, and all but danced 1368 feet above the teeming crowd below for some forty-five minutes.  Man on Wire (the title comes from the police description of the incident) is the story of what has been called the artistic crime of the century, from the birth of the dream inside a dentist's office in 1968 to the completion of the amazing feat six years later.  While there are plenty of interviews with Petit's friends and accomplices, this is truly Petit's story.  Somewhere around 60 years of age now, Petit emotes a flamboyant energy and passion that demands your undivided attention, making it easier to see how he was able to recruit the team members necessary to pull off such a suicidal, highly illegal and seemingly impossible \\"le coup.\\"  When this film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Petit balanced the Oscar on his chin for the audience, in true showman fashion.<br /><br />Obviously, you don't just climb to the top of one of the Twin Towers, throw a cable across to the sister tower, and walk across.  The planning took six years.  During that time, Petit and several of his accomplices spent months basically casing the site, figuring out how to evade different levels of security, sneaking up to the roof on several occasions, taking photographs and constructing scale models to see how to set up the rigging for the walk, and trying to create during training the sort of unstable conditions Petit would face during his feat.  At one point, he passed himself off as a writer for a French architecture magazine in order to interview workers who were still completing the construction of the buildings.  While the Frenchman had made death-defying tight rope walks at Notre Dame Cathedral and Sydney Harbor Bridge, he had never faced the dangers that this walk entailed.<br /><br />There's rather a sad side to Petit's story, as well - namely, the breakdown of some of Petit's personal relationships in the wake of his great triumph.  One gets the sense that, even as she watched him make this magical tightrope walk, Petit's extremely supportive girlfriend sensed that she was losing him - both personally and spiritually.  Petit now belonged to the world that reveled in his daring accomplishment, and the man gleefully recounts how he made passionate love to one of his brand new fans as soon as he was released from police custody.  It is the story of Petit's relationships with the men and women who devoted themselves to helping him realize his dangerous dream that makes this documentary such an emotional viewing experience.  Petit is revealed herein with all of his spots, which makes this a very human story.  The charisma of the man is also something to behold, and listening to him speak about his art and dreams is nothing short of spellbinding.  I could never have turned my eyes to the sky to watch this man taunt death between the Twin Towers, but nothing could have taken my eyes off of every second of this unique and powerful documentary.ght rope walks at Notre Dame Cathedral and Sydney Harbor Bridge, he had never faced the dangers that this walk entailed.

After 23 days (and counting) on the slow carb diet, I reduced my weight by 13 lbs without exercising. Here are the basic rules to the diet.<br /><br />1. Avoid \\"white\\" carbohydrates (or anything that can be white).<br />2. Eat the same few meals over and over again.<br />3. Don't Drink calories.<br />4. Don't Eat Fruit.<br />5. Take one day off per week and go nuts.<br /><br />Thanks Tim, I feel a lot better and look forward to losing the rest of the weight and thank you Kindle for not having to lug around the huge 4 hour body book.
0316098337|5.0|This book is an excellent read!!! I actually bought it randomly while on vacation as I had already finished the book I brought with me and was looking for something new. All I can say is WOW! As a social worker, this books sent my thoughts reeling as you realized how a child's environment plays a role in his or her development (the sole focus of a year long course in all social work curriculum). You really can't grasp how environment impacts development until you hear/read things from Jack's perspective.<br /><br />As for all the reviewers who struggled to read through Jack's grammatical errors- he's 5. Not only that, the only person who has ever talked to him is is mother. Yes, he heard things on the TV that they had and from books, but his only opportunity to try using language is with his mother. Here again, another area that is impacted by environment.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers in that this book would be a great read for young adults. The actual horrors that are eluded to aren't described in detail, leaving your mind to fill in the blanks. Thank you Emma, for such a wonderfully written book!!!

B002ZG98FU|2.0|I worked in television for several years, and some of my favorite films are about the industry: \\"Quiz Show\\", \\"Good Night and Good Luck\\", and \\"Broadcast News\\".  I had high hopes for this comedy, because I've enjoyed the principals in it very much in other films.  But \\"Morning Glory\\", despite an occasional funny joke (the name of the bottom-tier network featured is IBS---not bad), tries way too hard to compensate for a weak script and a misbegotten message with an superinfusion of perkiness.  Rachel McAdams is all-energy, as usual, but here she's addicted to Red Bull.  This was obviously an attempt to heighten contrast with the dour, phlegmatic ex-anchor played by Harrison Ford, but McAdam's nonstop perk screams: \\"I'm the next Meg Ryan!!!\\".  Even the DVD cover accentuates this---she's kicking a high-heel shoe behind her and grinning at us.  I wish she had underplayed this role more. I've worked with TV producers; it's a challenging job, and they tend to be grimly dedicated and impatient---Holly Hunter in \\"Broadcast News\\" got it just right---not smile buttons.  McAdams is a wonderful actress elsewhere; right after I saw \\"Morning Glory\\" at the multiplex I rented \\"The Lucky Ones\\", a small, terrific movie about a trio of Iraq war soldiers on leave.  McAdams plays the one female.  From beginning to end she is believable, and at no point does she attempt to win us over with her dimples and beauty and charm. (She's far more appealing because she holds back.) \\"The Lucky Ones\\" a road movie, is a lot more entertaining and even funnier than a movie with a war theme has any right to be. Rent it! But that film had a good script, and something significant to say.  \\"Morning Glory\\" accepts the trivialization of TV news not as a depressing trend, but as blessed relief---let's admit it, we all prefer fluff!!!  La la la!!!  I kept on waiting for this philosophy to be detonated by anybody but Ford's character, but it never is.  He's the gruff sad sack with the antenna stuck up his fanny---the embodiment of rigid principle as killjoy. Ford's occasionally very funny.  But in the end, the script requires him to do a turnaround and to respect not only  McAdams's determination and hard work, but also the insipid television content generated under her watch.  It makes no sense that he'd ever do this.  But the movie needed an upbeat ending with the two stars reconciled. \\"Broadcast News\\" resisted the temptation to have Holly Hunter and William Hurt go off together at the end.  This surely disappointed many viewers, but it was in character....and the movie was a hit anyway.  \\"Morning Glory\\" has a high gloss, but it wipes clean with a damp rag, and judging by the other reviews I've read online, this squeaky-cleanliness has its devotees.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|As far as an album that takes you on a journey, \\"Feels\\" is much better. But there are a few incredible tracks here. What gives? These tracks are so good... and the rest so bland... This doesn't seem like Animal Collective's usual behavior to have this problem, but it's one of those \\"buy the singles\\" type of records.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Plugged this into my blu-ray player and was amazed at the quality of the image. The colors were bright and stunning and I could see depth in the screen. This film on a 1080p screen can convince almost anybody that they are missing out if they don't have one. The movie itself is a classic that my little boys love. The characters are memorable and lovable. A great edition to our family collection.
0385732554|4.0|There is nothing like being stuck in society that is oppressive; recent events in the Middle East certainly typify this sentiment. The power of thought, and the risk of thought against a reluctant rule is the base of the wonderfully clever and thought provoking book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry. Lowry is compellingly able to dive into not only the mind, but the soul of a younge boy, now entering his own stages at become a man, Jonas, in a small but restrictive community, aptly named The Community. Assigned to his own perfect position, Jonas meets \\"The Receiver\\", translating to Jonas as \\"The Giver.\\" What is revealed as the two, the young and the old, wraps to cover a relationship expressed through every intergenerational experience. Moving quickly from clich&eacute;, Lowry attempts to escape all points the norm, but at times is subject to dismantling her moments of pure ecstasy and hope with often more sobering scenes of a disrupted society and human fault.<br /> This fact, tied with the stolid pace and writing style exhibited in the first few chapters, leads to a slight urge to drop the book by page 30, if not out of sheer frustration with a plot that seems to thin to become anything of interest. However one must stick out, as the themes and moments of desperation acted upon by every character begins to humanize the text, recognized by Lowry as she gains more confidence in her ability to deliver a more lively and, more importantly, emotional environment, allowing for all of her characters to thrive. The pages seem to rip by quickly once one has conquered the first 50 or so pages, and it is a sad time to close the pages, though hope remains in the air. One may find, as this reviewer did, wishing for a few more chapters, just to sink one's teeth into a story of whimsy and darkness, all combined in a harsh world of control. This psychological journey is certainly one to dive in feet first; just remember to breathe at times.
B000069AUI|5.0|Excellent album. Not as good as Parachutes but definitley top notch. \\"In My Place\\" and \\"Clocks\\" are the best tracks.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I saw this when it first came out in the 90's and it introduced me to Masterpiece Theatre and my long time love affair with period films, novels and Jane Austen. It arrive quickly and I watch it all the time.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I received Unstoppable to review and I liked it a lot more than I expected to.  Talk about being on the edge of your seat.  It's full of non-stop action, suspense and deep characters.  I haven't been captured by a movie like this since \\"Speed\\".  My husband and I were in awe because it is a true story and the characters were so creative.  I even found myself yelling at the screen because I became so engrossed in this film.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I saw this once on Masterpiece Theatre and have been looking for it ever since. I watch it all the time.
B000000IRY|5.0|exellent clapton album from start to finish, his quality shines through,great songs with sleek production and soulfull backing vocals make it a pleasure to hear!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Seen the movie 4 times now and each time it gets better - more pieces click into place.  It is one of the best constructed movies ever made.  Many lines take on extra meaning once you can see the whole layout in your mind.  And not a shot is wasted or extraneous.  You can tell this was a film with a very long gestation period.  We'll be lucky if we see such an intelligent big budget movie again any time soon.
B00004TWSX|5.0|an absolutely stunning album from queen, melodies harmonies and sublime guitar work makes this a essential purchase in every ones music collection!truely fantastic music
B00008H2LB|5.0|I love this band and this album is one that you can play all the way through.  I had to purchase this after a group of teenagers broke in my car and stole all of my CDs.  This was one I decided I could not live without, so I bought another.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|I bought this beautiful little amplifier (*Fiio E5 headphone Amplifier*) just about a month ago and have been very happy with it ever since! It has a tiny slide switch for extra Bass which I most definitely use. This little gem will increase your total volume x2 which should be sufficient for most users. If you are someone who wants to absolutely blast out your ear drums you might want to try the FiiO E7 USB DAC and Portable Headphone Amplifier. If you just need a good clean sound boost then the Fiio E5 headphone Amplifier is for you...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last edition was different and took on a more serious tone. However, I think it couldn't have ended any other way. I still loved it because it seemed like a realistic way for the story to go and this whole Trilogy was excellent. I recommend it to everyone!!
B00139XTG4|5.0|I would recommend everybody to read the book, not only professionals or people interested in risk management. Taleb focuses on some judgmental errors we face during our work experience. He easily discovers some mistakes that we never think about, but which are quite obvious.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is a cd that gives a new meaning to the blues.  Gregg Allman sounds killer in this collection of old, obscure blues songs.  Of course he is surrounded by some fine muscians that make this just an all around great listen.  Getting hooked up with T-Bone Burnett was magical.  Purdum Pam
B004HKZHES|5.0|once again sonic youth demonstrate that they will never compromise their vision as a band. the sound on this album is so strong you forget that it is a soundtrack for a movie.sonic youth are one of the great bands of rock and roll for all time and are the best post rock band in the world. if you like sonic youth you will enjoy this album.
B00000DI06|5.0|John Rutter's \\"Requiem\\" is best heard with him conducting.  The tempos are perfection - no wobbly vibratos among the sopranos.  Buy this version if you want to hear the work the way the composer intended.
0307455874|5.0|I enjoyed this book, much more than \\"Dreams of My Father\\". I am not a politics wonk, but I did find most of the book interesting and insightful. I most appreciated that he seemed to take issues seriously and reflect on the pros and cons of various positions (see for instance the section on judicial activism, which I think he nails).
B00095NX9G|5.0|This is my very first bellydance DVD. I've never taken a class even, but this DVD is so easy to follow. Mind you it isn't easy. It is definitely a challenge. My recommendation is to take it in sections. Start with the yoga. I worked on 15 minutes at a time, by the end of the week I could (more or less) do the entire workout. I do like the yoga section a lot. There is little in basic info, because it is an intermediate DVD. I purchased this with [[ASIN:B001L9UG6W Bellydance: Beautiful Technique from Step One - The Beginner's Path to Flawless Artistry]]which is packed with what I would call \\"day one\\" lessons. All in all a great purchase.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Excellent British series on the history of World War II from an English perspective, narrated by Lawrence Olivier. It includes the events leading up to war-war in Europe-Poland,France 1940.Battle of Britain,Barbarossa, desert War-to Pearl harbor when the war became global, through the various campaigns- Russia,Italy,Normandy,Pacific,the bomb- and the end of the war.Special features include making of the series,home fronts,the Holocaust,and the death of Hitler. Overall an excellent history of the events of WWII from a British viewpoint.
B00479SVBU|5.0|If your car does not have an aux input for your MP3 player or iPod, this little device is the next best thing.  I have tried at least 2 other FM transmitter devices, and within a few days threw both of them out.  Not so with the Satechi.  It transmits a clear signal and good sound quality to your FM radio.  What I like best, though, is the fact that the Satechi has a built in player, and you can simply put your music on a SD card or USB stick.  The little remote that comes with it is very handy for navigating through your collection.    I have 2 of the older models (with the red LED display) in my other vehicles, but decided to go with this model for my car, as it has a much improved user interface as you can see your music and folders, plus it handles more folders.  If you have an AUX input on your car, this device can connect to the AUX directly.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|Terrible, just terrible.  I don't think friends should make movies together.  It is too self-indulgent.  Viggo Mortensen was his usual cardboard character (does anyone see a difference between this character and Tom Stall from \\"A History of Violence\\"?).  No emotion in his voice.  A one-note intonation.  And eerily enough, Ed Harris also seemed to have channeled his \\"A History of Violence\\" cardboard character as well.  Renee was pretty good.  She at least seemed animated and kept you from falling off your chair while you fell into a coma just trying to stay wake watching this western.  And for the life of me, I don't understand why they used that flat-chested woman who looked  like a boy as the saloon prostitute.  In the real old west, the prostitutes were very well endowed and much, much heavier.  Jeremy Irons as the villian was okay.      In short, boring film, cardboard characters (except for Renee)and just some self-indulgent friends making a movie. Save your money.
0670022411|5.0|This book is simply great!  There are not enough words to describe it.  As I read, I am actually visualizing everything that is going on.  Due to chronic migraines, I also have this book on my mp3 from Audible.com.  It is wonderful to read and even greater to listen to!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|This is a wonderful BluRay experience! The extra features are so cool! The board game and the magazine included is a must for any fan of the movie!! DO NOT listen to any of the bad reviews from people who do not know how to buy the correct region!!! This BluRay plays great on my player and it will on yours too! Just make sure you buy the correct version!!
0316066524|5.0|INFINTE JEST. (1996) David Foster Wallace.<br /><br />Everything you have heard, read, and that has been said about Infinite Jest is true. Should YOU read it? Is the only relevant question. This book is work--it's going into the gym and the classroom. (It is 1079 pages and holding it requires strength and strategy. And Kindle, iPod, or cd isn't a remedy because of the classroom aspect--you will want to highlight, and write in the margins; and it requires two bookmarks--one for the body and one for the endnotes.) This book, though a novel, is a journey into the mind of David Foster Wallace and is one long suicide (Wallace hung himself 12 years after publication at age 46) note. But it is not grim and dour. It is, at times, gruesome and frightening, yes, and also funny, and always insightful into the human condition and especially the American pursuit of happiness and pleasure along with the concurrent escape from discomfort and pain. And mostly about the inherent and ironic conflict between pleasure and pain--how the relief of pain into pleasure ultimately creates more pain, which causes one to seek more relief/pleasure, i.e. a psychological and physiological trap--a cage with no way out ... except maybe through a Twelve-step program which is SO boring so as to be not worth the effort. And then, there is reincarnation--which DFW never calls by name (something he does with the Psychoanalytic Reaction Formation, also) but which plays a huge part in the story. Both.<br /><br />Should YOU read it? I rank it as one of the four best books of all time. I lived with it for three weeks pretty much not doing anything else but reading and thinking about what Wallace was saying. I stopped drinking (One theme is addiction) and didn't bother to go out or watch any entertainment or do any work of my own (writing). It, the book, moved into my mind--took up residence in my apartment, became my roommate. Of course that is ironic also because the book's first name was \\"A FAILED ENTERTAINMENT,\\" and the book is the most entertaining thing I've ever experienced - passively; but then it is work so it's not completely passive, as say watching something - \\"spectation\\" Wallace calls it. What the book is is inside the brain of a particular personality who happens to be a genius with a photographic memory (which again he doesn't name but describes: \\"Hal [a central character] can summon a kind of mental Xerox of anything he'd ever read and basically read it all over again, at will, ... .\\" (Pg. 797) I think parts of Wallace surface in all of the characters (there are scores of them) and what he does is to debate through interior and exterior dialogue, btw & w/in characters. Ideas/thoughts/philosophy (and of course this is discussed. He also critiques his own writing style via this, his technique,) Wallace's personality is, if categorized by the trait theory of The Big Five (OCEAN) [I think]: Extremely high O (open) slightly less but still very high C (conscientiousness), somewhat low E (extraversion, i.e  Introverted), somewhat low A (agreeableness) and somewhat above average N (neuroticism). Add to that an extremely high I.Q. with that memory thing, a large physical presence (6'2, 200lbs.) and a cute and interesting face and you've got the man. If you think you can relate to those characteristics--you'll probably be taken by, and drawn into the novel as I was. [About being high O. Highly Open persons tend to be bored by people below them on the continuum, which looks like arrogance, elitism, snobbery, creative showoffishness, etc. Openness is the trait most associated with creativity. They also tend to be low in A (a `pussified' trait) for obvious reasons.]<br /><br />That by way of introduction. Briefly now, a look at Infinite Jest by way of the six elements of a story.<br /><br />Title: Perfect, either one. Defines the book.<br /><br />Plot: There is only a very almost inconsequential one. It is sometimes a distraction. It is about the relationship btwnthe USA and Canada and the use and disposal/reuse of energy and territory. In an interesting way - it is woven into the pleasure/pain conundrum and so therefore worth some consideration. The personal and political intersect with, I think, some very bizarre drug enhanced imaginative thoughts and ideas. Free association.<br /><br />Characterization: There are three main protagonists. Hal Incandenza, a 17 yr.old, privileged white boy, at an elite youth tennis academy in Massachusetts; founded by his father (alcoholic) and run by his mother (OCD). Hal is addicted to marijuana and nicotine and a gifted and highly rated tennis prospect. He has younger residents/students/players he mentors, as well as two brothers who play prominent roles. Don Gately, a 29 yr. old, staff resident of a halfway house for recovering substance abusers, located adjacent to the tennis academy. Don is 9 months sober and oversees other recovering addicts. He is recovering from addiction to downers and a life of crime. Remy Marathe, (of unknown age) a legless Canadian, and member of a group of wheel chair assassins involved with the USA v. Canada's political/environmental/territorial mess. There are numerous sub-characters within these three facets of the story - the tennis academy, the halfway house, and the governments of the two countries. There is a prominent female character, Joelle van Dyne. She is involved with Orin Incandenza (Hal's older brother); James Incandenza (Hal's father); Mario Incandenza (Hal's younger, deformed, brother); and Don. She is also a person of interest i/r/t Remy's work. She is addicted to crack cocaine and a girl of exceptional beauty--the P.G.O.A.T.--the Prettiest Girl On The Planet. To me, none of the characters were all that likable.<br /><br />Setting: The story takes place mostly in and around Boston, Mass. USA in the near future [The book being written in the mid 90's.] year of 2007. It is spring through fall and there is rain, humid heat, and snow. The \\"action\\" is mostly in and around the tennis academy, the halfway house and the seedy underbelly of Boston. There is also the desert SW around Tucson. Wallace is the best I've ever read of painting landscape and cityscape with words. He is also the best at the littlest details of people behavior. [Reading him is in some ways like opening your eyes to the world for the first time.] The zeitgeist is a future that revolves around telecommunications and entertainment, both voice and video. It is eerily accurate i/r/t where we are today. [It was written pre Internet & wireless explosion.]<br /><br />Style: This is maybe where most people simply go batty and throw the book against the wall. There is no consistent POV or voice save for Wallace's. He breaks every rule (for writing) there is ... and yet he pulls it off. All the characters pretty much talk the same, with the same idiosyncrasies, i.e. Wallace's. He uses conjoined conjunctions up the wazoo: \\"And so but... That thus this is why... So and but that night's next ...\\" etc. He repeats words: \\"Then he considered that this was the only dream he could recall where even in the dream he knew that it was a dream, much less lay there considering the fact that he was considering the up-front dream quality of the dream he was dreaming.\\" [then he adds, mocking himself] \\"It quickly got so multileveled and confusing that his eyes rolled back in his head.\\" (pg. 830) Events are not lineal. Sometimes events and persons don't become clear for 100s of pages. He makes up words. He uses obscure words. He uses acronyms up the wazoo. He uses endnotes that are stories in and of themselves. The endnotes sometimes explain the main story. There can be page upon page w/o a paragraph break. His segues sometimes are just barely, and then ... the sidebar has next to nothing to do with anything except - the central theme(s). This is the where the personality factor of Openness factors in--if you're not of a like mind/brain--it'll drive you nuts. The storyhas no ending, the book ends.<br /><br />Theme: The strongest case for reading this book. DFW says the book is about: Tennis; Addiction; & Entertainment. It is that, and more. Some readers struggle with the minutiae of tennis. But the game of tennis and the discipline required is a metaphor for life, in Wallace's mind. This is what is taught at the academy, and also all the AA stuff, characters and references. Delay of gratification and effort and struggle are their own rewards ... blah,blah, blah and yada, yada. Life is a GAME and it is not about you or who wins that matters. Ironically--nothing matters. Addiction is covered from head to toe, from its genesis to its usually horrific conclusion. You think you're not, addicted, maybe you should read this book for that reason. Entertainment and the individual and that relationship- ship's- ships' (Wallace's style is infectious) exploitation by design and by fate (Never named.). Then there is the issue of control, choice, and self-determination, which is the underpinning of The Game, Addictions, & Entertainment. Is it (control) really just a delusion? So why not - seek pleasure and submit to ecstasy? And running beneath the underpinning is all the unnamed Freudian stuff (Also, never named.)--that childhood decides. That even the best of intentions can have disastrous consequences, and not even here to get into all the horror of the ubiquitous neglectful, abusive, and incestuous parenting stuff that Wallace explores. And finally [not really possible] Wallace's take on reincarnation--that YOU will be killed by a woman, and that that woman will be your mother in your next life.<br /><br />Got time? Time to explore who you are and why you do what you do--to step outside your cage and study yourself as subject? Take a vacation ... haha.y house and the seedy underbelly of Boston.

B001NHNG64|4.0|After reading a number of Reacher books out of sequence. I decided to catch those I hadn't read in sequence. In the 1st book & in later books I became hooked on the Jack Reacher character almost immediately. One of the nice parts Mr. Child included was these need not be read in sequence.<br /><br />There seems to be something I found a bit \\"Off\\" with this one, especially after \\"Killing Floor\\", which is the 1st in the series. This seemed a bit too descriptive in parts. Some descriptions were merely not needed. Jack's attraction to the heroine, Holly, just doesn't seem to come together. Rather, it just falls apart at some point. It never gels one way or another. The decision of which city the militia intended to target seemed to just come out of the blue. I remember asking myself \\"Wehre did that come from?\\" The whole militia story in Montana was feasible, but not too plausible.<br /><br />I love Reacher's character & Lee Child's style in the way he brings Jack to life. This one seemed to just miss a couple points by a margin. But, misses none the less.<br /><br />Is it still worth reading? Absolutely. Mr. Child, don't lose this character you've created.

0446563048|2.0|About four years ago I bought a pair of boots from Zappos.com. It was a very pleasant experience and the customer service was outstanding.  So when I saw an advertisement for this book I hurried to take it out of the library.  I was greatly disappointed.  Mr. Hsieh is obviously a talented and intelligent person.  Unfortunately his talent doesn't extend to the written word.  It was a struggle to finish reading it because of the pedestrian language and the  numerous repetitions some times one or two sentences apart.  Big mistake not to get a ghost writer and a good editor Tony.    This man hasn't grown up yet.  All the drinking and other shenanigans by him and his \\"family\\" were very offputting.  The idea that anyone working for Zappos has to spend all their time at work and after work  together I found slightly creepy.  Also, although he kept saying he was looking for diversity and different points of view that didn't seem true to me after reading the book.  Zappos seemed more like clone city than anything else.    Now I come to my biggest problems with the ethos of the company as depicted in the book.  There is no mention anywhere when writing about the culture of the organization about encouraging his people to do  community  service or support a charity.  I know this is supposed to be a bussiness book but if he can write about his Red Bull and Taco Bell \\"adicitions\\" then he could have made room for this as well if it does indeed exist at Zappos.      Finally it seems I am not getting something.  In my opinion getting great customer service and upgraded shipping only leads to very temporary happiness.  I guess one would have to do a lot of shopping at Zappos to keep the buzz going.  But may be that's the idea. Repeat customers would certainly make Mr. Hsieh and his bottom line happy.

0891419063|5.0|Eugene Sledge has written the finest account of Marines fighting in the Pacific that I've ever read.  A highly personal, no holds barred story of the horrific fighting they waged against the Japanese on Pelelui and Okinawa.  This is a higly readable and epic sweep across the Pacific and to the doorstep of Japan's home islands.  The closer they got, the worse the fighting was, and Sledge pulls no punches whatsoever in describing his experiences.  I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know just what the WWII Pacific campaign was like.
B00328G4XY|5.0|Okay, so I never bought Electric Ladyland before the remastering, so I won't describe what the differences are. All I can say is that this is yet another outstanding job from the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The music ranges from divine to astonishing. It's like Axis: Bold as Love and Are You Experienced put together: the songs are excellent from beginning to end. I think my personal favorite is the fifteen-minute \\"Voodoo Chile.\\" Most of it is just blues music, but it's smooth and unpretentious. The others are completely unforgettable, especially \\"Still Raining, Still Dreaming\\" and \\"Voodoo Child, Slight Return.\\" Unfortunately, however, this would be one of the last albums performed by Jimi Hendrix himself. I wish he lived longer and continued to create more legendary rock music. But hey, he, along with Redding and Mitchell, created three fantastic albums. We have the freedom to enjoy them continuously for their catchy lyrics and amazing music.<br /><br />Grade: 9.7/10
B0040UAYI4|4.0|I bought this after purchasing a PS3 and COD-Black Ops. I have been a PC Gamer since the 80's and avoided console gaming because of the controllers. If you are use to a mouse and keyboard for FPS games this WILL help you, but if you're expecting PC mouse and keyboard performance, you will be disappointed.     I still use it for FPS games on the PS3 and prefer it to the Dualshock, just don't get your hopes up that this is a perfect substitute for a PC mouse and keyboard.    The best settings for Black Ops will be something close to 8/8 48/48 with an in-game setting of 10 (insane). Good luck!

B00192IV9U|3.0|I'm a huge Michael Fan...and I'm not completely happy with this. I understand why people said they shouldnt put this out. I believe only about half of the tracks were actually completed by Michael himself, and for those tracks the CD is worth it to me. But the other half of the tracks sound as if he wasn't able to finish even recording the vocals, let alone the production. They seem to have \\"guessed\\" as to how he wouldve wanted them done. Some songs don't even sound Michael...and they're not, they used someone else on vocals who sound similar to MJ. Only worth it if you are a big MJ fan, because the tracks that he did finish himself are great.

B000U0F7RG|1.0|Hi all,  I purchased this set for my wife back in December 2010 as a Christmas gift and the product arrived in a very quick time frame.  However, two of the first three discs did not play or played very \\"jerky.\\"  No amount of cleaning helped and we tried them in different DVD players as well.  I sent an email to the seller on January 6th outlining the problem and have yet to get a response and it is now February 21, 2011.  One would think when spending around $180 that the product would be in excellent form and work but this is not the case with this seller.  To those who purchased from this seller and received a great product, I'm envious.  To those looking to purchase, buy somewhere else.  It isn't worth the hassle and loss of money.

1594202842|4.0|Written about a 10 year period in the family's life.  The youngest daughter moves from age 3 to 13 in the book.  The most egregious behavior by the mother is told in tongue-in-cheek fashion.  It is a fun and honest depiction of a mother's quest to raise great daughters and follow her cultural norm in a society that is more familiar with Oprah than excellence. Its a great read with plenty of funny moments. It is not a parenting guide. Its a heavily edited memoir.
B000GSA59M|5.0|Amazing! as goes with all the other behringer hardware, Ive ever bought. just amazing! keep up the great work!

0525950079|2.0|Fiction is the easiest way to learn history, and the writer of historical fiction has a duty to portray history realistically, so as to not miseducate the reader.  Follett does a good job of that.  Then he both limits his audience and ruins his whole work with such graphic and detailed sex (which the publisher calls \\"juicy history\\"), that it ruins the book for many people.  How can I recommend this to my granddaughters?  I cannot and will not.  Like Gwenda, I had to just grin and bear it, in order to get the historical flow of what was otherwise an excellent teaching tool.  Too bad that Follett panders to those who want lurid fiction.  It could have been a toss-up:  four stars, or five?  But now it's a Two.
0670022411|5.0|ADOW is awesome! The characters are well written, and I found myself rooting for them right away.  Intrigue, history, vampires, witches, what more can you ask for.  I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out. I tried to read the story slowly (to savor it) however, towards the end I was racing through the pages, it was a thoroughly satisfying book.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|Rush in Rio musically is not bad....BUT....the vocals on this release are terrible!!I trust this release was trying to mirror a \\"bootleg\\" release,but it fails when you can buy \\"LIVE RUSH\\" c d's that are far above the quality of this attempt.
B004HO6HWA|3.0|***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />This remake of the classic version from 1972 with Charles Bronson had some things right, but overall it really falls short of even competing with the original, let alone besting it.<br /><br />The 1972 film had a sort of detached coolness and a more visceral grittiness. These were professionals who did not get emotionally involved with the assignment. Jan-Michael Vincent's \\"Steve\\" wanted to prove he had what it took to be at, what he perceived, an elite level. Also there was a late 60s, early 70s counter-culture subtext to his motivation. And that was really interesting. Whereas the analog in this remake comes off more as a listless wanderer who has no clear idea what he wants to do, but he thinks it would be cool to kill people and he is emotionally overcome by the revenge aspect.<br /><br />Another fault I found was in the actual killings themselves. There was no detachment and precision. It was just raw death by torture in many cases. Sloppily fighting with the target, or shooting your way out of after a botched hit. Too much of the tired, formulaic \\"Hollywood modern action\\" was written and you lose all the nuance, the art of the kills which these mechanics would care about (even perhaps more than the monetary reward).<br /><br />Hollywood films these days tend to assume the average movie viewer is a moron, so they try to connect as many dots for us as possible. This is patronizing and downright offensive. The match up between the old and new Bishop illustrates this glaringly. Bronson's Bishop was about control, he was in supreme control and his downfall was letting his emotion hinder that control. Everything he did was calculated. And this was no brute, he was a cultured assassin. I felt that the writers tried to convey this with Statham's Bishop but it came across very hammy (the numerous shots of his record player) and forced. Also time and again in this remake we saw a Bishop that seemed to be driven by almost pure emotion, a reactive Bishop who was never in control except marginally in the opening hit.<br /><br />This remake emphasized over and over the revenge motif and I think it was a mistake having Bishop go after the Company. This was never even a possibility in the original film and I like that because it established a boundary that even Bishop had to recognize. It's the cheesy desire in Hollywood action films for the main character(s) to always get retributive justice by their own hands. I see this time and again these days and it gets very tiresome.<br /><br />This remake shows that a vastly bigger budget does not equate with better film making.<br /><br />Regarding pacing the remake seemed a bit too fast, however that wasn't surprising.<br /><br />I am torn regarding the ending. On one hand I like the fact that Bishop bested Steve and lived to see another day in this remake. However philosophically I must give a slight edge to the original film in which both of them die because the narrative is stark: in this business of death there is no clear winner. I think even the first film should have explored some of the moral issues a bit deeper and may even had a redemptive dynamic, but that would be clearly a different sort of film.<br /><br />So to sum up, this remake was enjoyable as a modern action film, but if you want a bit more depth and nuance see the original!control except marginally in the opening hit.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book ever. It had some confusing parts, but overall it was an incredible book. It had some killing in it, but to make a long story short, it was basically a survival story while you are trying to kill others at the same time.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Slow to start but incredible in scope, 999's combination of intriguing novel sections and challenging puzzle gameplay end up making this perhaps the best DS game you'll ever play. Though you'll really need to hit the True End before you think that for reals.
0897500482|4.0|This book is a great addition to the martial artist's library.  Bruce Lee's philosophies are arranged by section for a flowing presentation.  The only thing I wish I knew was that it was all little snippets- a lot like The Art of War or Confucious.  Otherwise it is one to read a little and digest for a while.  Good diagrams when needed.
0786955570|2.0|My group of seasoned D&D players (2nd Edition through 4th Edition) decided to try this out instead of our regular campaign recently.  After playing it for a few hours, we came to the conclusion that the only way to enjoy the game as shipped is to just laugh at the fact that every card draw is most likely either going to kill you or come close to killing you.    I have seen it said that this game is \\"D&D Lite\\" or that it could be used as a gateway to get people into playing actual D&D.  That is patently ridiculous.  If anyone who has never played D&D thought this game was a good representation of it, I highly doubt they would play D&D, which is actually much less difficult and far more enjoyable than Castle Ravenloft.    Now, I know there are people who like a \\"challenge\\" or who think they are smart and special because they put up with a ridiculously difficult game.  That is fine if you are into that sort of thing, but my group would rather actually enjoy themselves.  After we played we came up with a bunch of house rules that could actually make the game playable.    If nothing else, I guess it gives me some dungeon tiles and single-color minis to use.

B000CNFC76|4.0|Given the dearth of really good golf movies - Caddyshack is often rates the highest in surveys - this movie stands out. The Disney treatment doesn't do it any harm, as the actual story is nearly a fairy tale to start with. Even the hard-to-swallow aspects of the movie turn out to be historically accurate. There is only one glaring departure from the facts: Vardon's score is fabricated: he lost by 5 strokes, not 1.    Nevertheless, the bulk of the film is accurate and entertaining. If you have a budding golfer in your family, you will appreciate this movie's avoidance of sex and language. It is 99% pure golf.

B003Q6D1YW|2.0|I think the younger one is, the more one can enjoy the mild 2010 documentary \\"Catfish.\\" In this dull age of reality television and mockumentaries, \\"Catfish\\" could easily be mistaken for fiction. In fact, about 10 minutes in I had to ask my girlfriend, \\"Is this fake or real?\\" Turns out Nev Schulman is reality, though attractive enough to be mistaken for an actor, albeit in the role of a nerdy best friend. As this contrived documentary begins, his discussions with the camera while tapping away on a laptop appear to be performance. Very little of \\"Catfish\\" feels unmistakably authentic, and there are times when it resembles a lessor episode of [[ASIN:B0012XIGXM Monsterquest - Complete Season 1 (History Channel) (Steelbook)]].    Here's the set-up, and there will be spoilers. Nev, brother Ariel and friend Henry Joost are attractive, single New Yorkers scratching out a living as professional photographers and filmmakers. Nev has a Facebook page and is one day contacted on-line by 8-year-old prodigy artist Abby of rural Michigan. She mails Nev a painting based on one of his magazine photographs. They correspond over a period of months and soon he begins to receive multiple paintings of horses, Abby's portrait of her beautiful Mom and even lovingly detailed paintings of his own personal photographs on Facebook. Nev, flattered and intrigued, also becomes Facebook friends with Abby's mother and her gorgeous, single 19-year-old sister Megan. Nev and Megan become smitten and soon develop an on-line romance, texting and cooing by cell phone on a daily basis. At this point, Nev's bro and bud decide to make a documentary about his increasingly steamy, long-distance relationship with Megan. It beats working.     Where \\"Catfish\\" leads is not a surprise. Having been on the Internet for almost 15 years, I have personally experienced the highs and lows of international chat rooms, busy dating sites, Friendster and MySpace. I lost interest in social networking ([[ASIN:1430225963 SocialNetworking Spaces: From Facebook to Twitter and Everything In Between (Beginning)]]) about the time Facebook exploded across the globe. Over time, one learns through experience things are not always what they seem. It goes with the territory and you develop a sixth sense about fake profiles. Nev appears to be dumb as a post, which seems odd for an educated and ambitious New Yorker.    With social sites, telling signs can be suspected immediately. But the Schulman brothers and Joost choose to ignore clues for the sake of their \\"searing\\" documentary. First and foremost, it's abundantly clear the Facebook photograph of beautiful, corn-bred, single, virginal, gorgeous Megan is a professional picture of a model. For anyone who has scanned social sites, you can immediately tell the difference between fake and real profile pictures. The paintings arriving by mail in huge, elaborately wrapped cardboard boxes are also not particularly good and yet, according to Abby's Mom, they are selling for thousands of dollars across the country. One immediately suspects something is awry.    Yet, even these clues do not stop our extremely vapid team of investigators. They discover Abby's art gallery, which they were told had a recent grand opening, does not exist. The music on Megan's page, supposedly composed by her, has been stolen from YouTube. It's clear everything about prodigy Abby, her good-natured mother and the too-good-to-be-true Megan is a lie. At this point, most people would delete the pages and end the friendship. Through experience, one learns to differentiate between the real and fake almost immediately. On dating sites, if they claim interest but avoid meeting out for coffee or Happy Hour, it's because they have something to hide. Move on.    These filmmakers choose to remain because, after all, everyone wants to be a star, including Abby's mother. The energetic New Yorkers pay a surprise visit to the small town Michigan homestead, but not before picking flowers on theside of the highway for Megan, just in case she exists.    Do we need to go further? Are we truly surprised a heavy-set, 40-something mother with handicapped children trapped in a dilapidated rural existence has created a fictional story to ease the pains of a dreadfully depressing reality? Wouldn't it be nice to be an attractive, 20-something New York single guy making a living in the arts? And even nicer to expose the realities of those less fortunate?    I admit when watching \\"Catfish\\" I was fascinated throughout. While Nev and his team are not in possession of great intelligence or depth, I was entertained by their attempts to crack the mystery. Is this documentary deserving of the attention it received at the Sundance Film Festival? No, but as noted earlier, it's a dull age.

0385732554|4.0|I read this book back in seventh grade and was decidedly against the plot of the story. As a beginner in the realm of more advanced literacy, I was very unhappy with the undefined ending and did not fully appreciate the depth of the text. Rereading the novel as a senior in high school, I find myself actually drawn into the novel and find myself relating to and rooting for Jonas as he makes a choice for what he thinks is right. While the story is originally meant for children, it is one of those rare stories that change meaning as the reader grows older. When I was twelve I saw the work as complete fiction and not relevant to my life at all, but now I understand how the search for \\"utopia\\" in the novel is a reflection of our modern world and my understanding of The Giver's literary predecessors brings the message of the novel to a new level of importance. This book is truly one that can effect readers of all ages as a critical look at the state of the world's social and political landscapes and the unceasing question of what we will give up for our safety.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is set in the US after the country has collapsed and been replaced by Panem and the districts that surround this capital city. Every year, 2 children from each of the 12 districts are required to compete to the death, mainly for the amusement of the residents of the capital, but also to remind the districts that they are under the control of the capital. Katniss is the hero of this story, fighting in place of her sister.    I believe this story is placed in the young adult section mainly because the lead characters are all in their teens. DO NOT let that turn you off reading this novel. It is a fast paced, exciting read. I finished this first novel in 2 days, and forced myself to hold off on buying the next in the series until my vacation. There is some suspense, but if that is what you are looking for, I would go elsewhere. I was after a page-turner and this definitely fit the bill.
B001TH8UUA|1.0|I purchased two of these cables around Christmas with a brand new TV. One cable lost connection when bent a certain way. Amazon was great about sending a replacement. Now in February, I discover a similar problem is causing audio to cut out randomly in my setup. These cables are cheap and not well made. I don't recommend spending a lot for a cable, so don't run out and buy Monster Cable. The cables I bought from Monoprice are much better made and have given me no problems.

142311339X|5.0|This book starts out very creatively to introduce new characters and revitalize the series. Riordan has penned something great again! When you get to Camp Half-Blood, more mysteries surface, which helps to reinvent the setting for this series. It does not even hint of Harry Potter as the last series did. This book breaks the mold. Riordan tells the story in three different voices, and it works suprprinsingly well. It adds to the excitment. Riordan is excellent at unfolding his plots so that you may get an answer to one question, but it only opens up two more questions! A fantastic page-turning plot! Each character has a disctinct voice, but since the main characters are all new demigods, their successes seem more luck than skill. I did clearly see Leo's ability and skills at getting out of a bad situation (though the flying a helicopter thing was a little far-fetched). Jason and Piper's abilities were not very consistent. And where Piper grew more confident, Jason still seems a little lost (yes, his memory is lost, but I did not feel him as much). The character's internal struggles were clearly defined, which made them engaging. Amazing, while developing these three new faces, Riordan also creates a detailed and full storyline which explores new aspects of the gods' mythology. I love where this story can/will go and the exploration of both Greek AND Roman mythology. When I finished the book, I was SO sad to find out I'd have to wait until fall for the next one. That last line made me go, I CAN'T WAIT and didn't see that coming! Riordan does a good job at keeping you guessing and entices you for the next book. Come on fall, lets go!!! Its like waiting for the last Harry Potter movie!!!!

B001DJLCRC|5.0|A chemistry teacher, Walter White, finds out he has terminal lung cancer and but a short few months to live. Determined not to tell his family, an unexpectedly pregnant wife, Skyler, and teenage son with cerebral palsy, RJ Mitte, he sets about preparing for his death by thinking of a scheme to leave them with the biggest amount of money possible - meth. A chance encounter with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, who is now a drug dealer, sets the wheels turning and the two become an unlikely team - he cooks the meth using his years of chemistry experience and Jesse distributes it. But how does he keep all of this secret from his family, especially his brother in law who is a Drug Enforcement Agent? Throw in the troubles that come with selling meth and the scene is set for one of the best TV series of the last 10 years.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston does a star turn in his role as Walter White, bringing an intensity and empathy to a character in such a way that he always gives a memorable performance in each episode and fashions a unique character along the way. Aaron Paul does a brilliant job bringing to life the character of Jesse Pinkman and giving him the humanity you perhaps wouldn't feel for a drug dealer. Anna Gunn does an even better job in the role of Skyler White than she did in her last role in &#34;Deadwood&#34; (another AMAZING series) and creates a complex and conflicted character with real depth.<br /><br />Though the first season is short (7 episodes) each one is packed with wonderful dialogue and plotting as we see Walter and Jesse bumble their way through the stages of creating a drug dealing business and overcoming the many obstacles along the way, namely rival dealers, and Walter juggling the time he spends away from his family cooking meth and hiding his illness. It all makes for utterly absorbing television and is yet another jewel in the crown of American drama TV, putting to shame British TV where all we seem to do is create exportable formats in the shape of talent contests, games of luck, and dance shows.<br /><br />&#34;Breaking Bad&#34; is mesmerising TV and this is coming from a guy who rarely watches TV. After just 3 episodes I saw round a friend's house I had to buy the 1st and 2nd series and I was not disappointed in the least.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Season 2 picks up the moment when Season 1 ended with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman stood in the junkyard with the psychotic drug baron Tuco having beaten to death one of his henchmen for nothing. From there we're taken on a whirlwind tour of 13 of the best episodic drama series ever written.<br /><br />Haunting black and white images of a burned purple teddy appear throughout the series, teasing the viewer at a tantalising finale. Walt's cancer gets worse prompting him to do more desperate things to get money quicker for his family, while Jesse falls in love with a recovering drug addict.<br /><br />As Walt and Jesse's operation grows they recruit more of Jesse's druggie friends and we meet a charismatic but crooked lawyer who helps the duo launder their ill-gotten gains. Skyler begins suspecting what her husband is up to during all this time while getting closer to term with her pregnancy, and all the while Walt's brother in law Hank the DEA agent is getting closer to discovering who is producing this new high quality blue meth...<br /><br />Incredibly, Season 2 is better than Season 1 and is twice as long so the characters are given more room to become interesting and develop, the storylines get fleshed out, and the studio has given the crew more money so everything is done on a larger scale.<br /><br />I loved the new additions to the cast - Jesse's friends, his love interest and her father (played by the brilliant John De Lancie) and the crooked lawyer played by Bob Odenkirk was a wonderful highlight as well.<br /><br />There are so many exceptional scenes it's impossible to list them here. The writing is as amazing as always, the acting is as strong as ever and the entire series is a joy to watch from start to finish. Utterly entrancing and wonderful television, I highly recommend this series to fans of high quality drama and to any who are uncertain as to whether or not they want to buy this after Season 1. Bring on Season 3!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Though I wasn't terribly impressed with the film nor would I purchase, it is a great film for children. There is no questionable language or situations. There are plenty of great horse scenes which any young horse lover would enjoy.<br /><br />The quality of the film is a little on the made-for-tv side, but that could be easily overlooked by a child, which is the intended audience. It got a bit boring with the whole rebellious, communist daughter scenes, but I suppose family issues had to be a part of the story.<br /><br />Overall, it is a family friendly film with a very happy ending and good message.
B003HYSSZK|5.0|I used to watch this series back in the seventies and was so glad when the reboot came since the CGI just elevated the visuals to match the brilliant stories that have been made for so long.    Every actor that takes on this role is scrutinized heavily, and I have to say that Matt Smith's interpretation is great.  He does a lot with the physical aspects of the doctor (where David Tennant used more voice aspects) and it's just very well done.  The companions this time around are some of the best as well.    I have watched this series several times and so far I am not getting tired of it.  I can't wait for the next series to start!

B004BH0GUW|4.0|This looks clean for a older title. The Colors jump off the screen and every detail is lush. This looks just like it did when I saw it on an HD Channel a few years ago. This looks to be very film like but the film grain does not distract from every detail in the movie. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the BD Live function does not work on the menu. My internet connection works fine but the disc will not take the update when I click on \\"BD Live\\" on the Main Menu. Boo to Sony for that problem with the menu. I assume it is Sony because my \\"BD Live\\" features work on all my other discs. Bottom line great remaster but bad Menu options.

B004A8P2HE|5.0|Portia De Rossi's beautifully-written and overtly witty autobiography has easily become one of my favorite books of all time! I could not put it down from the time I purchased it. This is a moving tale of obsession and unrealistic expectations. I could not believe some of the things she put her body through, and more importantly, I could not believe the rigorous honesty she recounts such instances as: running up and down seven flights of stairs for hours on end because she consumed 60 calories worth of chewing gum. Such stories are heartbreaking to read, but as you are reading you can tell that she is so far removed from that way of thinking that you find yourself laughing and crying at the same time. I couldn't believe how well-written the biography of a hot, blonde actress could be. I honestly felt like I was going through a journey of shame, paranoia and ambition along with her. I HIGHLY recommend this book!

B0044FEZBC|5.0|I first saw this performance in a local theater, then kept searching for a BD version of it until it appeared on amazon.uk, then waited months until it finally made it to amazon.com in the States. Why? Because the lead ballerina's technique is totally amazing - so fast and precise that her performance needs to be seen to be believed. Most dancers visibly initiate movements and end them; she seems to avoid these transitional phases, going apparently instantly from one position or path of motion to another without those visible connecting moments of acceleration and deceleration.<br /><br />As a former amateur male dancer (primarily ballet) wih martial arts training, who performed in minor roles with local and sometimes visiting professional companies, I seldom have any interest in watching male dance technique. However, I found myself intently watching the lead danseur in this performance - he's that good.<br /><br />The sumptious staging of this ballet and the high skill level of the entire company are apparent in this performance, but not unexpected of the Bolshoi company, trained as it is in the classical Russian Vaganova technique. Still, it is very pleasing to see such precise limb placement, without the sacrifice of beauty of form for speed of movement that accompanies so much of the Balanchine technique.<br /><br />This is by far and away my favorite ballet recording, so much so that I bought a second copy as a gift for my local professional ballet company so that their dancers, choreographer and staff also could appreciate the performance.

B004L3AQFG|5.0|It's about time 127 Hours got the wide release (thanks to 6 Oscar nominations) it deserves, so today was the day I got to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I think everyone going to see the film knows the basic facts of this true story. Aron Ralston goes hiking, falls, has a giant boulder land on his arm, and in the end he has to resort to removing his arm with a dull pocket knife to allow for his escape.<br /><br />Even more so than Tom Hanks in Cast Away, James Franco is the movie. There is a brief scene before the fall when he meets two girls and there are a number of quick flashback and fantasy type sequences with other characters, but for the most part Franco is the only person on screen. I remember the days when almost everyone (including me) said this guy couldn't act. I'm talking about his role in the Spider-Man movies. The first time I noticed real acting talent was when he played the stoner in Pineapple Express. I'm here to tell you that this is the best performance by an actor I've seen in any movie released in 2010. I haven't seen The King's Speech yet, but Colin Firth will have his work cut out for him in my eyes. Into the Wild shows another character based on a real person and similar to the one Franco plays here, but rather than a kid who thinks he knows everything about survival and the wilderness, we sympathize and want this character to prevail, mostly thanks to James Franco's likeability in the role. He shows just about every range of emotion and I never for once thought I was watching anything other than the real person fighting for his life.<br /><br />There are two things I didn't really care for. Danny Boyle's style of quick editing felt out of place at times and I could have done without some of the music choices.<br /><br />Other than those minor negatives, 127 Hours is well paced, suspenseful, expertly acted, memorable and easily one of top 5 films of 2010.<br /><br />If you like this movie or if it sounds like you would, check out the one man show that is Ryan Reynolds in Buried for nearly the same claustrophobic intensity. For the man surviving in nature aspect, check out Sean Penn's Into the Wild. They are not at the same level as this film, but both are still worthy of a rental for those with more than an ounce of patience.nolds in Buried for nearly the same claustrophobic intensity.

B003LSTK8G|5.0|I have read several of the leading books on both the macroeconomic bases and policy mistakes leading up to the 2008 meltdown of the financial markets.  While Lewis's book may not be rigorously analytical, I feel that it best conveys the madness and greed that brought about the subprime catastrophe. The most troubling thing in the end is that the reader is left wth the sense that it will all happen again and again until we find a way to align the interests of bankers with the banks themselves.
B003TXKSWK|4.0|On this disc, John Legend takes some old protest songs and gives them new life and new relevance. His partners in this venture are the Roots, who are only one of the best bands in America right now. While it's the intense and riveting musical performances that stand out first, I also gained a new appreciation for the songs. The lyrics about topics such as war, education and the environment were written decades ago, but they are so timeless, they could have been written yesterday. One of my favorite albums of 2010.

B002JM1VJG|3.0|Of course we all know that Madonna is a shapeshifter. But this DVD really refreshed my memory on the enormity of this matron-of-pop's creative scope.<br /><br />I lament the absence of Bad Girl, which is one of my favorites. A video that moved me and carried an emotional gravity that some of the other included-tracks lack. Also it is a shame Fever never made the cut. I regard Erotica as being the zenith of her creative career and I bemoan the fact  that two videos from that period were cut. AND it is galling that the Erotica and Justify My Love videos, whose very premises were to provoke, have been censored by clumsy black bars.<br /><br />What's left is a still impressive albeit occasionally disposable (see 2nd half of 2nd disc) collection. And while the quality is not excellent, it is nice having the majority of her body of work available outside of the constraints of youtube. Three stars.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|This is the best recording the band has made yet.  Sonically it's the funnest to listen to.  Paul and Billy are playing their best, and Eric just sounds terrific.  With all of the talent out front it's easy to forget about Pat, but he's doing damage on the skins.  The CD is harder and heavier than most of their other stuff but still has the melodic hooks that made the band famous (at least in Japan).  With all of the bad music polluting the internet this CD feels like a breath of fresh air.
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain offers a unique perspective as it's told by Enzo.... the Swift family's dog. While this book handles some very dark life situations (death, illness, loss of family), Enzo's voice gives it a humorous frankness that had me laughing out loud. It's a rare book that manages to have your heart aching and laughing at the same time. Even though I know absolutely NOTHING about racing, the author simplifies it and uses it more as a metaphor for life that we can all understand.     SPOILER ALERT: The one negative to this book, is the fake sex offender/rape charges brought against Denny. Any fake charge of this nature is damaging as it invalidates truthful claims. However, the author manages to handle this with grace and adds a depth to the characters through this situation. Despite this one minor flaw, The Art of Racing in the Rain is beautifully written and very endearing. \\"The car goes where the eyes go\\" (Stein, 2008, p.218).

0307454541|4.0|I will admit that the first few chapters were slightly difficult for me to push through, as it focused mainly on the central character's journalistic problems in the financial world. However, once I made it through the beginning, a very well laid out mystery kept me interested the rest of the way. While I could not relate to either of the two main characters, they have an interesting relationship. Their own quirks and abilities contribute to the fast paced action and mystery that unfolds in the second half of the novel, and I would recommend that you read the first novel before continuing on to The Girl Who Played With Fire (a fantastic follow up).
0670022411|5.0|This is one of those books that make you want to do nothing but sit and read, or maybe stand in the kitchen and read - any time there are a few minutes free - grab the book and devour a few pages.  Yet, I did so not want it to end. Fascinating and enthralling are two words that come to mind.  The characters are so real. I cared so much about Diana and Matthew and Sarah and Em and Ysabeau and Marthe. The plot, except for a few times here and there, is just engrossing. So rich in history and information. I know, a lot of big words ending in \\"ing\\", but seriously this book is great.  Now that I have reluctantly turned the last page, I want to go back and read it again immediately. I feel like there is so much there that I may have missed something and I need to go back and re-read it.  My only question is how long do I have to wait until the 2nd book comes out??  Hopefully, it will be sooner rather than later.  Congratulations, Deborah Harkness, on a masterpiece!!!
014241543X|5.0|This was a quick, but very moving read. Several days after completing it, I am still thinking about the story and the horrible choice that she faces. The book forces the reader to think... If in the same situation, would I stay?    Gayle Forman manages to tackle the immense subjects of grief and loss in her YA book. While I am not one who often cries while reading a book, this story did bring tears to my eyes. With the loss of all she holds dear, Mia still faces the horrible decision of whether or not she will remain behind or escape from this world and the pain that remains in it. This is a story about love, life and loss that I would recommend to everyone I know. With the heart break, there also comes reflection and a true sense of love and hope. With Forman's follow up novel releasing this April (Where She Went - told from Adam's perspective), I would highly recommend that you read If I Stay immediately. It is a book that will stay with the reader for years to come.
B00005221M|3.0|The movie was better the second time we watched it.  The first time we saw it we were disappointed, having read the book.  It is VERY different.  (We expected it to be different, as all movies are, but this just barely followed the book's story line and characters.) Once we settled in our minds that it was a completely different story we enjoyed it more, but still found it a bit shallow.
030745455X|4.0|If you liked The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I would definitely recommend this second book in the series. Although parts of it are slow, as in the first novel, the pace picks up as it progresses. There is a great deal more action than in the first novel, while Stieg Larsson still manages to address the issues of woman trafficking and abuse in greater depth. The end is a page turner, and I was AMAZED by the endurance of Lisbeth's character. If I were ever in such an impossible situation, I would hope that I would have the courage and tenacity that Salander displays. Parts of the book may seem a little implausible, but the story is incredibly engaging. Two thumbs up.
B003L7DK74|4.0|The Good:  Includes all of the episodes from the two seasons of Flight of the Conchords  The songs are funny and sometimes really touching (\\"Carol Brown\\" is a standout)  Fairly mainstream, accessible humor.  This collection has been a hit with a lot of my friends and family.    The Disappointing   Collection only includes the TV series and the HBO special.  The addition of the two FOTC music CDs would be worth paying a little more    Verdict  I've been thoroughly pleased with my purchase (Amazon likes to put it for sale in the 20 dollar range, making it a real smart buy).  Most people will enjoy the wacky, awkward, and oftentimes touching series, but if you're really on the fence the first episode of season two is available to stream online legally

B000FC2PKG|1.0|I am surprised that this book was written by a woman.  I found it to be prurient and cold.  The character development was similar to that of a made for TV movie.  Seems to be a weird melange of The Lovely Bones, The Departed, and Cape Fear.  I'm sorry that I wasted my time on it.  I chose to read the book as Amazon suggested that since I enjoyed \\"Crossings\\" I would enjoy this book.  I will be much more skeptical about Amazon's recommendations in future.
0307454541|1.0|I had to add my 2 cents.  The good reviews for this book seem to never stop.  The worst are the reviews that laud the girl with the dragon tattoo as a feminist!  What?  I read this book (yes, I read the whole thing) because it had been reviewed so well and by so many as a good thriller with a strong female lead character.  I hated it!  I still cannot even understand why it is titled \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" as it seems to mostly be about Blomquist the journalist and the development of Salandar's character is entirely shallow and secondary.  Not only that, but this book is definitely NOT feminist. It is rather all about the terrible, awful, violent things that men can do to women to make them hurt.  Ew.  I wish that I had never read this as many of the superfluously graphic violent scenes replay in my head often and I can't remember what the plot, the mystery, or the story was about anyway.  I will decidedly not be reading the other 2 books in this god-awful trilogy.
B008AT71WI|2.0|Note: The date may be wrong because I also reviewed an earlier release.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, then odds are you already know that this release contains the alternate ending to Little Shop of Horrors.  It certainly does, but it lacks the proper context and is almost uncompletely unwatchable.<br /><br />When Little Shop of Horrors was overhauled, more than just the ending had to be changed.  The film's tone needed to be made lighter on the whole in order for the new ending to make sense.  The film lost a passionate soliloquy from Seymour on the ramifications of his actions.  While not cut out entirely, the \\"chopping\\" scene, was edited down as to not dwell on Seymour's disgust.  (The scene was also rescored from scratch.)  The biggest change was the proposal scene, which had to be entirely rewritten in order to remove the implied desperation in Seymour's hasty proposal to Audrey.<br /><br />Kurt Galvao, the editor that Warner assigned to restore the film, did not look into any of the above.  He didn't even listen to the film's commentary track, which clearly stated that the proposal scene was reshot to fit within the context of a happy ending.  Galvao took the previously leaked black-and-white \\"rough cut\\" of the original ending and matched it up with the color film negatives in the Warner vaults.  He attached it to the film and showed the end product to Frank Oz, who was satisfied enough to do publicity for the new release.<br /><br />The version of the original ending included on this DVD is over twice as long as the version Oz had approved before beginning preview screenings.  He and Galvao have repeatedly denied this, but the proof is in the pudding.  The copy of the film shown to test audiences was recently obtained by an anonymous individual with connections to the film industry.  This man (or woman) uploaded the deleted segments from the film to YouTube, including the last director-approved version of the film's ending from before the infamousOrange County screening.<br /><br />Galvao was granted access to all the existing film negatives, including those for the deleted scenes mentioned above.  Rather than putting in the effort to restore Oz's vision, he simply put in the effort necessary for people to know that he put effort in at all.  He half-assed one of the most important film restorations in history and not even the film's original director noticed.  Frank Oz is a brilliant artist and an all-around swell guy, but he's getting older and, consequently, doesn't have the most accurate recollection of his earlier films.  His  willingness to help spread misinformation about this release has hurt the film.  Hardcore fans are annoyed, of course, but casual moviegoers have also expressed displeasure at the length of the film's finale.  \\"Don't Feed the Plants\\" is intended as an epilogue to hammer in the film's message, but instead it lasts as long as one of the Hollywood action sequences it pastiches.<br /><br />If you still want to order this DVD, then you probably should.  People that aren't Kurt Galvao worked hard on this and deserve to be compensated.  Just remember that what you're watching isn't the real \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\".  If you want to see that, then you're going to have to make a fan edit.

B003L77G10|5.0|WARNING: This review contains spoilers for Season 1. If you have not watched it, please don't read this review.<br /><br />This DVD set is for Season 2 of the award-winning legal drama, The Good Wife, starring Julianna Margulies  as Alicia Florrick, the \\"good wife\\" of the title of the series. I'll try not to repeat myself too much from the review I previously posted on Amazon for Season 1 which is located here: http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHXRDL3D0W5C/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FSTN52&nodeID=130&tag=&linkCode=#wasThisHelpful.<br /><br />A summary of the main events of Season 1 are as follows: Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) is publicly humiliated as the \\"good wife\\" of a cheating politician, Peter Florrick (Chris Noth). What makes it even worse for Alicia's situation is the fact that for years she sacrificed her own legal career on behalf of her disloyal husband. Soon after Peter's relationship with a hooker is exposed to the world and he resigns in disgrace, he is thrown in jail for paying for the prostitute with public funds. While Peter is in jail, Alicia gets a job practicing law with the firm of Lockhart & Gardener in an attempt to take over from Peter as the family breadwinner.<br /><br />One of the two main partners at the firm is Will Gardner (Josh Charles), a man Alicia had strong feelings for before her marriage, feelings that Will shared, though they were never officially romantically involved. At Lockhart & Gardener, Alicia is thrown into competition for a permanent job with another, much younger associate, Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry). Cary is extremely competitive, but Alicia is naturally collegial and kind, and it goes totally against the grain for her to try and cut him out. Ultimately, though, Alicia realizes she wants, and financially needs, her job badly enough to push aside her scruples and call on the help of Eli Gold, Peter's cagey political adviser (Alan Cumming). Eli helps Alicia defeat Cary by bringing major business to Will's law firm. This is where we are at the end of Season 1 for this amazing series which was nominated for an Emmy.<br /><br />At the start of Season 2, the firm of Lockhart & Gardener is about to merge with another legal practice, and everyone's job security is threatened. In particular, Kalinda (Archie Panjabi) is no longer the firm's only private investigator, and the new one, Blake Calamar (Scott Porter, [[ASIN:B000RF1QE2 Friday Night Lights]]) has a seedy past and the ethics to go with it.<br /><br />The series continues to have standout performances by the regular cast, and wonderful guest spots by brilliant actors such as Michael J. Fox, who repeats the role he played last season as disabled lawyer Louis Canning, who uses his disability to manipulate juries. Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh in [[ASIN:B0000AC8LZ Office Space]]) returns in his role of Season 1 as Kurt McVeigh, a sexy ballistics expert who is the unlikely sometime lover of Will's politically progressive partner, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski).  Rita Wilson (an outstanding character actress who is married to Tom Hanks) plays hotshot attorney Viola Walsh who sends a fascinating case to Diane.

1401309666|3.0|It's difficult to even begin writing a review containing any less-than-stellar remarks about such a profound, groundbreaking, and personally influential individual, such as Chris Anderson. Mr. Anderson's body of work as a whole should be a staple to any modern marketers daily reading. Nonetheless, \\"The Long Tail\\", while brilliant in its premise, says the same thing far too often, without ever doing much to advance or build on the story being told.    Anderson's original Long Tail article in 2004 had much the same effect as one of more recent pieces: The Web is Dead. Long Live the Internet. He shocked the masses and upset the age-old principle of what marketers should be doing. The 5-page article was so overwhelmingly popular that 2 years later this book by the same title followed.    I have to take a step back to again point to how brilliant the idea that Anderson broke down in both the article and book were. They are, at least, partially responsible for the new direction many marketers have been able to head toward since its release to the masses. The only things missing are a pattern of development throughout the book, or at least more case studies that are not related to the same few industries referred to countless times.    Anderson's entire premise is that the direction of marketing has changed paths. No longer is there an absolute necessity to drive for the blockbuster hit, but instead a fundamental shift towards the marketing of products and services to small, incredibly interested, niche groups. As Anderson puts it, \\"Hits are great, but niches are emerging as the big new market.    The book quickly turns its attention to the profound shift in buying within the movie and music industry. We come to understand how the world has gone from resource scarce, to a digital age where we are resource abundant. In his words, \\"A very, very big number...multiplied by a relatively small number...is still equal to a very, very big number.\\"    Some incredibly well thought out concepts, such as the loss of the water cooler effect (the spark of varied interests amongst masses of people), the forces behind the shift to long tail marketing (\\"culture unfiltered by economic scarcity\\"), and the power of the collective intelligence (Google PageRank, Review Sites), amongst others.    The area where Anderson fails to grow is in the case studies that he provides.  In a book whose purpose is to deliver the importance of niche audiences, Anderson seems to land at a very far end of the curve; only interested in delivering to those in the movie and music industry. With many of his points, any interested reader can certainly think outside the box about how these principles relate to their own industry, but please, Chris, help us out some!     There are certainly other brilliant notions, such as the shift away from the 80/20 Rule (Pg 134), the possibility of too much choice (Pg 170), which factors should be in place to become a long tail provider (Chp 14), and Anderson does reach outside of his long tail comfort zone briefly in Chapter 13, but unfortunately this book could have been summed up in about half of its pages without detracting from it. The remaining pieces could have just as easily been introduced or reintroduced in \\"The Long Tail Blog\\" as he did after the book anyway,    In conclusion, I must reiterate the importance of this book for any modern marketer or MBA, in general.  Everyone should read the first 4 and the last 2 chapters of the book, as I believe they are universally applicable.  I do, however, offer 2 recommendations after this: 1. Read everything in between if your goals and interests involve music and television. Or 2. Continue on to his Long Tail blog where you can get a far greater breadth of knowledge on the long tail's effect on many industries.
B003INBOEC|5.0|This movie just blew me away. Donnie Yen didn't disappoint with his Wing Chun performance. It's amazing that his character is actually Bruce Lee's master, and this movie showed what he went through during Japan's invasion of China. Lynn Hung, Donnie Yen's character's wife, did a great job considering that this was her first time acting. Overall, great story and great action. This is now in my martial arts films favorites.

B002ZG97EC|3.0|I bought this movie and didn't know what it was about. My husband and I are adopting older children and were looking for movies that wouldn't hit on a sensitive subject for our future children while we were forming a family. This movie hits all the bad notes: box of shame as punishment, cruel social worker, older kids obviously wanting a forever home but being told they would never be adopted, adopted and used by Gru, sent back to the orphanage. This is a horrible movie if you want to watch an adoptive family friendly movie with children who will remember their pre-adopted lives. I was horrified by it all and wished there were movies that would not have abusive parents or abandoment as a theme main plot, movies without those topics are hard to find.<br /><br />On the other side I did find the movie hilarious if I wasn't viewing the movie as something I wanted to watch as an adoptive parent. It reminded me of old school cartoon like Tom and Jerry and Bugs Bunny where there is a lot of physical harm but everyone survives to confront their enemy again. I gave the movie a 3-star rating because it was funny but it lost stars because it failed to meet my personal criteria and wasn't politically correct for the adoptive parents and children viewers. It was far worse than any of the other movies I've recently viewed in that respect. Hopefully, this review will help someone else like myself from making a bad decision and purchasing this movie for their adoptive family.

It makes you think, it's got romance and suspense and action and a little comedy...it's got it all! i love leo dicaprio and joseph gordon-lovett, so putting the two together in a kick butt movie is brilliant. i could watch this movie repeatedly, and i'd always feel like watching it again. a million thumbs way up!
076115678X|4.0|Updated review 1/28/13:  With a few adjustments, I have made the curly girl method work for me.<br /><br />1) The curly girl method worked only after I let my hair grow long.  Having very curly hair means a drastic diff in length between straightened and curly.  Leaving it curly before my hair grew out just looked awful.  Now, with my hair below my shoulders (when curly) it has some weight and doesn't just fly in every direction.  It also means my hair is long enough that I can gently lift it back into a ponytail without disrupting the curl units much -- so I can get it off my face/neck when needed.  Plus, now that it's grown out the curly hair on top is long enough to cover the straight hair at the nape so the diff in curliness is not noticeable.<br /><br />2) I use no gel. I get all the hold and conditioning I need from [[ASIN:B000TFJHZ0 DermOrganic Argan Oil Intensive Hair Repair Masque 1000ml/33.8oz]].  There is no stiffness and plenty of shine.  My hair moves easily, it's not set in place like with gel.<br /><br />3) I got a really good cut from a curly haired stylist who cuts it dry.  It's three times what I used to pay for a haircut, but I only have to go twice a year.<br /><br />4) Contrary to the advice of the book, I do comb my hair, but only when soaking wet with conditioner on it. If your comb is gliding easily, you are not damaging your hair, and the curl of course comes right back when it dries.  I do not believe there would be more or better curls if I never combed it.  I like to get the tangles out, and combing evenly distributes the conditioner to every hair much more effectively than fingers.<br /><br />5)  I no longer wear fuzzy winter hats, I carefully wrap my head and neck in a wool scarf for warmth.  Does not disrupt your curls like a tight wool hat that you pull on and off.<br /><br />So with these changes, I am now really happy with my hair!  Don't have to pack a bulky blowdryer when I travel, and by just leaving my hair ALONE (much less shampooing, combing, heating, tugging at it) the condition is now amazing!  Call me converted!<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Original review 2/22/11:  This method is a ton of work and will consume your life.  Sure, your hair can look great immediately after washing, conditioning, gelling and drying, and I'm sure the photos in the book were taken immediately after the models' hair was styled.<br /><br />What if it's 14 degrees outside and you wear a hat?  Not an Easter bonnet that sits daintily atop your curls, but a real winter hat that covers your ears and ties under your chin?  The \\"curl units,\\" as Massey calls them, will be destroyed and you get a static-y, fuzzy mess when you pull off your hat.<br /><br />What if it's windy?  Straight hair can be combed if it gets tangled in a strong wind from being on a boat or riding in a convertible, but curly hair with a huge handful of gel in it will either lift like a board in a strong wind, or turn into a frizzy mess that cannot be combed to fix it.<br /><br />Your hair is going to have to be re-wet, crunched and dried every single morning, cause once you sleep on them your perfect spiral curls will be a fuzzy, unruly mess.<br /><br />What if you want your hair temporarily out of your face or off your neck?  With my hair straightened, I can brush it up into a high ponytail and take a quick bath without getting my hair wet.  Or I can scrub the bathroom floor, or go for a run without my hair in my face.<br /><br />Using the Massey method, I felt like a had a fragile object sitting on top of my head that needed to be considered anytime I did anything other than sit still and look pretty in a perfectly controlled environment. But if you live a real life that includes walking the dog in all kinds of weather, doing housework, playing sports, you will come to hate this object that dictates what you can and cannot do if you want to look decent afterwards.<br /><br />Instead, with the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo, I can fix my hair into soft, fluid curls in about 10 minutes and my hair looks good for days, with only occasional minor touch-ups.  I look younger, cause you can see the shine in my hair, and those soft, loose curls are much more flattering to my squarish face.  My curls are not consistent all over my head.  I have nearly straight hair near the nape of my neck and in front of my ears and tight spirals on top. Also, one side of my head is curlier than the other.<br /><br />I can see this method making sense if you live in Miami or the tropics with constant high humidity and if your curls are consistent all over your head.  But for me it was a ton of work for so-so results.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|One thing I hate about Adele is the ease at which she can sing. When I first heard of her in 2008, after her appearance on SNL, I immediately fell in love. It amazes me how someone I don't know makes it seem otherwise. Her music is, in short, brilliance. Whether it be an upbeat song or her marvelous ballads, her powerhouse voice gravitates you. I was able to get an advance copy of \\"21\\" and, in all honesty, can say I have heard it every single day for the past 2 months.  While \\"19\\" is about falling in love, \\"21\\" is about breaking up; the process by which it happens, how it happens, and eventually coming to terms with the breakup and forgiving the other person, wishing them luck.   Kicking off the album is \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" a sort of F--- You to an ex. Those of us who have had breakups need an \\"I'm going to be alright without you\\" anthem- this is it.   \\"Rumor Has It\\" feeds off of the energy \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" provides. This song screams \\"You'll never find someone like me- I'm the best thing that has ever/will happen to you- Your loss!\\"  \\"Turning Tables\\" is the part of the breakup when you step back and say, \\"Whoa, what just happened?\\" It talks about being unhappy and finding the courage to say, \\"Ok, maybe breaking up is the best thing.\\"  \\"Don't You Remember\\" deals about a breakup so sudden, so out of left field, you don't know what hit you; Out of nowhere, your partner bails on you. It talks about dealing with the devastation because you don't know what you did wrong. It's a plea to your partner to stay.\\"When will I see you again? You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said. No final kiss to seal any sins.\\" This is one of my favorites off of the album.   Adele calls \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" a gay anthem, as she wrote it for her friend. It speaks of that person you let in that eventually failed you. They toy with your emotions after you exposed yourself completely to them. One thing that disappoints me about this song is that the live arrangement for itis SO much better than the studio version, as is the case with \\"Someone Like You.\\"  \\"He Won't Go\\" speaks vulnerability- feeling helpless about moving on from a toxic relationship.  \\"Take it All\\" expresses the frustration of giving your \\"everything\\" to someone but it just isn't enough.  \\"One and Only\\"= Asking your partner to let go of your past and asking to allow you to be the only one.  \\"Lovesong\\" is a Cure cover. Originally rearranged for Barbra Streisand for a project that never developed.  \\"Someone Like You\\" has got to be my FAVORITE song on the album. It talks about looking back on that one person that got away. The relationship in question had the wrong timing so it never worked out. Now, that someone has moved on, they're settled, and you allow yourself to be happy for them, even if it hurts, because you love them so much.   I will admit, I cried when I first heard this album in its entirety. The realness behind it is un-denying. Buy this album and won't help but adore it.

B003NHRIVQ|2.0|This movie might be good for teens who are too immature to realize that this movie is full of predictable plots and characters. It was sappy and lacked depth.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|This is an enjoyable film, set in 1982 - a somewhat worthwhile remake of the original Swedish Let the Right One In (Låt den Rätte Komma In, 2008). The films are based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist, written in 2004. Anyway, you can see the indecent haste with which the American production followed the Swedish - but this time the remake does have its charms - particularly in the young cast chosen. Chloe Moretz (Abby) and Cody Smit-McPhee (Owen) work  very well together - and casting generally is excellent - so the band of bullies who make Owen's life miserable are completely convincing. So is their demise, I guess!  What an interesting actor Cody Smit-Mcphee is!  He reminds me a little of a young Nicholas Hoult - so delicate and innocent - so it is a surprise to learn that his father has been a wrestler in his time, and is currently playing a leader of a bikie gang in a popular American series (who name I forget as it has yet to screen here in Australia.)   Finally, it should be noted that John Ajvide Lindqvist has described Let Me In as \\"a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel, for which I am grateful.\\"  Who could argue with the author?

B0034G4OVS|5.0|It's rare nowadays to find a horror film that doesn't rely on extreme situations and ample amounts of gore to keep its audience in suspense. To that end, \\"Frozen\\" is a true rarity. Writer/Director Adam Green, who cut his teeth on the slasher-throwback, \\"[[ASIN:B000WC389G Hatchet]],\\" oozes as much love for Alfred Hitchcock as he does for any of the myriad of directors who tackled the beloved \\"[[ASIN:B0002JP572 Friday the 13th]]\\" franchise back in the day and it shows. \\"Frozen\\" is a good ol' fashioned nail-bitingly intense experience that will leave you yelling at the screen long after the credits have rolled.<br /><br />In the film, three college buddies (Emma Bell, Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore) take to the ski-slopes to forget about reality for the weekend but soon find stress where they least expect it. On one last late-night round of skiing and snowboarding, the threesome find themselves stuck on a ski-lift. It seems nobody knows they are up there and since screaming won't suffice, it becomes rather apparent that they'll be stuck up there until the next weekend when the ski resort re-opens. As small-talk turns to panic, and panic turns to action, things only go from bad to worse when a storm starts looming overhead and a swarm of wolves gather at their feet. Could things possibly get any worse? Of course they can. And they do.<br /><br />Green pulls through with what is undoubtedly his finest film to date, but it helps that he is aided by an able cast and a real setting (no green-screens here, folks!). Our three characters not only ooze chemistry, but make the sort of dumb decisions that make them relatable without being completely unlikeable. You'll scream at the screen because even though they are being irrational at times (put your gloves on backwards, you dummy!) you like them and want them to survive. Bell in particular shines as the token female. Her revelation about the inevitable fate of her puppy not only raises the stakes, but shows off some major talent that is likely to go places in the future.<br /><br />Considering the low budget, the film looks great. There is ample atmosphere and at no point does the film lose credibility. It's a solid hour and a half of old-fashioned suspenseful torture. Green's script plays it old-school without giving way to clich&eacute;s and the end results pay off. Sure, there are some internal logic issues, but not enough to bring the whole down. In the end, the film presents a tense and realistic situation and keeps you glued to the screen until the bitter (?) end. All around, from the writing to the cinematography to the acting, this is about as good as it gets for modern horror. For lack of a better term, you won't be left in the cold with \\"Frozen.\\"y to go places in the future.    Considering the low budget, the film looks great.

B003INJETO|5.0|I would like to share my experience with this CD, in case it may help other PoS fans... I started listening to the CD once or twice as background music going to work. I was surprised not to find any of the typical PoS elements: metal riffs, intense vocals, guitar solos... I put the CD in my living-room shelf, convinced that it would stay there for a while. Then I saw one 5-star review in Amazon, and I decided to give it a try, this time with the right listening conditions: nice audio system, giving the music the attention it deserves. And, indeed, several months and several dozens of listenings afterwards, I can only agree with the 5 stars. I will not go into details (please check the other reviews for detailed descriptions of all tracks), but let me say that Daniel Gildenlow's songwriting only improves with time ('Sisters' must be the most amazing song yet written by the band), the emotion is still there ('I go home' in Road Salt sounds like one of the sincerest lyrics that have been sung by Daniel) and the whole album fits together as a 'concept' in a way that PoS have particularly mastered. Maybe the only lingering complain that I have about the album is the too evident 'to be continued' feeling in the last track - instead of the usual crescendo leading to a climax, the final track just fades out giving the impression that it is going to merge into the next track - let us see whether this is the case with the 1st track of Road Salt Pt. II, if and when it comes out...
0962477060|5.0|I think this book is great. I've come close to given up on learning the guitar after attempting it for so long and only being able to read tabs. Its very simply written so you have to go over it a lot, but the concepts are great. Its like finally something has clicked. The author brought a lot of insight on how to play and how the fretboard is organized. What an epiphany that there is a method to the madness!<br />I definitely think this is a must, just wish I would I would of studied this sooner when I started...

B001NEK2GE|4.0|03/14/2011<br /><br />Still getting used to it. I'm taking my time, switching between the G13 and my G11 keyboard.<br /><br />I'm liking this more and more, and continue to see its potential.<br /><br />Of my issues (described below, first installment), number 3 remains the valid. But, I do not consider it a strong negative criticism to say that some of the buttons are not easy to reach. This is because the G13 puts more buttons and greater programmability & customization at your finger tips than does a keyboard (even the G11 keyboard, which I use).  Part of the reason I'm adapting slowly is because I'm tweaking my set up slowly. I'm finding that what makes sense for a keyboard layout doesn't make sense for this. For example, for the G13, I find that I conceptualize groups of actions by the rows they are on rather than, as on a keyboard, the linear proximity (what is nearby). So I have main attacks on row 3 (my 'home' row, where my fingers rest), finishing moves on row 4 (top), shape shifting and special actions on 2, and less common gestures on row 1 (the bottom row of three buttons and least accessible).<br /><br />That being said, I did discover multiple ways to map  multiple actions to a button. By assigning the thumb buttons near the joy stick to Shift and Ctrl, I can then Shift-click or Ctrl-click any of the game pad buttons for more actions. Great stuff.<br /><br />It really does feel great to rest your hand on this device.<br /><br />02/22/2011<br /><br />I bought this for World of Warcraft.<br />I've had this for five days now.

Note: for this, my first installment, I have not yet contacted Logitech support or spent time with the documentation. Therefore, solutions to these issues may be forthcoming.<br /><br />Issues so far:<br />1. The device uses \\"profiles\\" in which to save settings. I have different profiles for each character. However, I have to force the change myself. It doesn't detect the change from within the game, and I've found no way to cycle through the profiles via the device itself.<br /><br />2. I have a logitech G11 keyboard, and I'm so far displeased by the way the two Logitech devices interact.  As far as I can tell, changing a profile on one device forces a change on the other device. I don't like this.<br /><br />3. Buttons: Some of the 22 buttons are very hard to reach. I want to give myself (and my hands) more time to adjust, but thus far there are at least 5 buttons that I can't reach easily. But \\"hard to teach\\" I mean that my fingers cannot find the button w/out my looking. In some cases, contortions are necessary to reach a button. There are at least 5 buttons that fit this description so far, reducing the total usable buttons to 17.<br /><br />4. Joystick: the Joystick works great.

Some reviews mentioned that it was slow moving, but since this is part of a trilogy, I consider this book the exposition of the whole plot. We get incites into the characters, their history and where the plot is going.  I can hardly wait for the next one. I now might get some work done while waiting for the next book. Wish I could have personnally bought a painting from Vermeer.

(Its not like I didn't know what was going to happen).  Its witty, insightful and puts the reader right into Henry's court.  This is not my first foray into the Tudor's lives, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a firt-timer.  But, after reading various historical novels of the period, as well as the Show-Time series, I was eager for the real story -- and its all here.  I feel like I know all the principals, and like them all.  Even Henry improves with understanding where he came from and how he came to be.  While I may disagree with a few conclusions drawn by the author as to motivations of the personalities, the conclusions she draws are few, far between and never laid down as absolute.  She tells the story, and lets me draw my own conclusions for the most part.  Well written, easy to understand, and almost impossible to put down!  Loved it.
B0013V33DG|5.0|From the moment I saw the Bavarians outfitted with kitchen pots, pans, hand farming tools, and a garbage can lid, to defend themselves from the advancing French Army, I lost it. I remember seeing Beverly Sills perform this opera a long time ago. This version steals the show. Dessay and Florez are at their best. When he came onstage in the lederhosen with suspenders, I fell apart. He behaved just like a lovesick young man. I was astounded when he hit those high notes during his pleas with Marie's \\"fathers\\" for her hand in marriage after he had joined the French Army.     I loved the scene where Marie irons the long underwear with a modern steam iron. This was a delightful anachronism to the 1870's setting. I iron most of my clothes, but never swing an iron as she does.     Needless to say, I love this performancee.
1932100660|5.0|I'm writing this review because I think it's extremely important that at least one person hears my story, please  continue reading to the end.    I've read many reviews of this book which state some of the inconsistencies in the scientific findings. And I   admit that they may have a point on that subject, who knows, I personally don't. But what I do know is that those reviews ignore a lot of really important findings in the book.     What I never hear these people talk about is friends, family and the people they know. I've seen the effects  of eating a largely animal based diet. Where I live I see it everyday.    What I've also seen is people turn around the progression of Cancer, Hepatitis B, Diabetes, and Heart Disease through choosing a Vegetarian or Vegan diet. I would say that's pretty incredible on it's own but it's not, it just  makes sense. A lot of my friends know many people who have followed the same path to healing. Now to support this further, my family, who have eaten animal products most of their lives and suffer from heart disease and diabetes have finally made the choice to switch! That's my Dad, Mom and brother.    They used to make fun of me for being vegetarian....non-stop. Now they are almost Vegan!     You know why?  Because they, as well as me have seen the overwhelming evidence of everyday people in everyday life. And that  evidence is pretty hard to ignore year after year. And they finally decided that maybe vegetables with all of their antioxidants, vitamins, fiber and proteins made sense. They as well as me have seen overwhelming evidence that prevention and healing makes far more sense then taking pills and waiting.    My Mom, who suffers from Diabetes has always been told by doctors \\"it's in the family\\" there is almost nothing you can do. Doctors and supposed nutritionists were actually telling her to always have some meat with her vegetables as this was her only chance at getting a lot of protein (and she was told that vegetable werestill bad carbs)! Not only is that very false, but she continued along that path and she saw her sugar levels go all over the place with no improvement. Can you imagine telling someone to just continue eating in such a way that doesn't help their disease at all? Before you go and judge all this, my family, besides the meat and dairy consuming tendencies eat a lot of vegetables and whole foods while consuming very little processed bull crap AND are all active 4 days a week. When I say active I mean my Dad rides his bike 50+ miles a week, my brother downhill mountain bikes a few days a week and my Mom plays competitive tennis 4 days a week. That's the way we've always been. So all of those people out there blaming all sicknesses of America on processed bull crap (though partially VERY true) are still choosing to leave out the animal portion.    I've told my family time and time again that a whole foods vegan or vegetarian diet would solve their problems, but they never had any of it. Finally, years later when my family finally sees the light...    My Mom has just recently switched to a nearly Vegan diet, one month and counting. Her, blood sugar levels have  stabilized and dropped. Yes, that quickly!! And now my Mom is a believer. All she did was continue eating, business  as usual but replaced animal protein and most dairy with more fresh vegetables and fruit!    My Brother has much more energy than he ever has before and solved his mysterious stomach problems. He is a semi-pro downhill mountain biker and semi-pro paintballer. My Dad has just started the process and hasn't had his blood work done, but you can be sure when he does his cholesterol levels will be down and continue to go down because that's what happens when you intake far less cholesterol.     It's really as simple as that people, clear as day. And I'm very happy to say that I'm excited my family has chosen health and longevity over sluggish, shortness of breath.    Sincerely,  Eric

B004LQI0HE|5.0|This movie was amazing!  As a future healthcare provider and a lover of love, it spoke to me in so many ways.  Although it goes against my normal rules, I might just have to go back and read the novel.  I'd highly recommend this film to friends and family alike.

0061900656|5.0|I got this book for my 2 year old (26 months) and he really enjoys it!  I don't think he really understands that there's a baby in my belly that will be coming home soon but he likes to read about the baby and point out the baby items on the pages.  He asks for it to be read again and again.  I really like how positive the book is and I think it really gets my son used to hearing the term BIg Brother in a positive way.  I think it's also great that it talks about how special he is and that he'll be special in a new way once he's a big brother.

1440503257|5.0|We purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas.  She and her sister have read all the Harry Potter books and seen the first 3 movies, they are Potter Fans.  She delved right in to read and discover what was in the book.  Simple to follow recipes, her first one to hunt for was Cauldron Cakes (Big Fluffy Pancakes).  The fun features are the comments and references to the books that is given on each recipe, so you know why it is in the collection.  I recommend it for any Harry Potter Fan who likes to be in the kitchen too, even if only 9 years old.

B0042K4ZZK|5.0|What's with all you people who can't stand Shane West, the actor playing Michael.  He's perfect for the role. Detached, a prick, but with a bit of a soft spot for his protege. And you want to kill him off? Not handsome enough for you? For the record, I'm a straight guy who thinks he's handsome as hell. As for Nikita, she so friggin gorgeous I don't care if her beanpole figure suspends belief in her fighting abilities. Love the show.
0345479092|3.0|I bought both this book and The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems: Sleeping, Feeding, and Behavior--Beyond the Basics from Infancy Through Toddlerhood. I would recommend buying The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems: Sleeping, Feeding, and Behavior--Beyond the Basics from Infancy Through Toddlerhood over Secrets of the Baby Whisperer: How to Calm, Connect, and Communicate with Your Baby. Everything that is in the smaller Secrets of the Baby... is in the bigger newer addition. I did not need to buy both books.     The EASY technique works like a charm with our little one who is 3 months old. It is nice to follow a routine, it makes our house run smoother. I would recommend buying one of the Baby whisperer books but not both.

0805209999|5.0|The Trial isn't a law story like something by John Grisham.<br /><br />In a way, it's not really like any story except maybe other works by Franz Kafka himself.<br /><br />That's because this book is like one of those paintings with a bunch of dots where you need to get in the right position to see the picture...except that the picture you see when you read The Trial is more about what you expect to see than anything else.  It's kind of like a written Rites of Spring by Stravinsky where you can focus in on what you will.<br /><br />In that way, what you see is what you get in this book, with each person seeing something different.<br /><br />So, if no view is objectively right, then what did I see?<br /><br />I think The Trial was a metaphor for \\"the trials\\" of life itself, which challenge, stress and ultimately wear us out.  In that way, \\"Defendant\\" Joseph K's all too arbitrary movements were all also all to familiar.<br /><br />If my slant on this book is different from yours, then maybe that's the point.  Maybe Kafka wanted to inspire individual responses and thereby make his book more relevant to each reader.
B003UESJIS|4.0|Mike Leigh is supposed to be cruel and be sure he is in this film. His target is the baby-boomers who are unable today when they finally reach the age to retire, to face life with any positive outlook and project. They believed the world was theirs, especially after 1968, and they wake up to find the young are the kings in the pubs and everywhere else, that these young, even when they are their own children, consider they owe them nothing and at best do what they want without asking for advice. So they develop an unbearable life style, drinking too much, smoking too much, eating too much, doing no exercise, and expecting everyone else, especially the young, to be their servants, the satisfiers of their needs and desires, including vaguely sexual or sentimental impulses. And they hardly know how to take NO for an answer.<br /><br />They have become predators and cannibalistic predators what's more, and they suddenly wake up in a world where everyone is strict vegetarians. The cannibalism of leaks, tomatoes and courgettes, or should I say zucchinis, is not very attractive and even difficult to imagine. In other words they have cultivated in the private gardens of their minds a full homegrown schizophrenia that makes them totally misfit for life and the world. That's how you end up under a train or dangling from a beam, or, quite normal for baby-boomers, dying of an overdose.<br /><br />Even if Mike Leigh is making fun of these clowns of mid-life and menopause, his cruelty has no limit to show how vain and how pathetic they are in their little worlds so secluded that they do not know the world exists outside. They have not been able to find the second inspiration in their life they need to keep doing something or a few things when they retire not to sink without any hope to come back to the surface again, into depression, alcoholism, tobacco fixation, sexual drives, desires and delusions, and a fast train to hell even before dying. For them Alzheimer or simple senility will be early companions in their finishing life, finishing too early. Even simple tasks like working in the garden become chores and they don't know that a simple girdle would protect their backs from pain.<br /><br />This being said the film is irritatingly slow and speed-deprived, banal and tasteless, centered on innocuous and valueless artifacts like a cup of tea, a beer, a glass of wine multiplied ad infinitum, one funeral and the impossibility for these over-educated doctors or lawyers or therapists or geologists to understand there are so many other things of interest in the world and that any other human being is not only an animated virtual robot but a heart and a soul and a mind.<br /><br />The only moment when the film is slightly more humane is when the black pregnant lady-doctor is trying to help a woman fully engrossed with her menopause depression and that white patient is not even able to look at the doctor in the eyes and insists on getting her prescription and nothing else, unable to express what she must be thinking at this moment when she expects nothing from this... and there words are evading me to pinpoint the thinking of this woman who had never imagine that one day she might be in such a situation, discussing her personal problems with a black ... The baby scene of this black lady-doctor will be so flat later on that I just wonder if this film is not a manifesto against racism.<br /><br />Enjoy the film but keep in mind what Jimi Hendrix would think if he could come back in our world just for a couple of weeks of vacation from the hell where he must be rotting.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUcompanions in their finishing life, finishing too early.

0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist is a simple fable about following your dreams. Along the lines of The Secret, it rests on the theory that everything in the universe (\\"the soul of the world\\") aligns to get you what you want even when it seems that things may not be going your way. I picked up The Alchemist from a friend's bookshelf and read it in a couple hours. The language is surprisingly simple, although very clean and beautifully succinct, and has an understated way of drawing you in until you are so engrossed in the story of the life of an Andalusian shepherd boy that you're halfway done with the book before you can blink. That's the power of simple but good writing for you.    The Alchemist is full of spiritual and practical messages, a key one of which is that \\"the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself.\\" In addition to tackling self-doubt and fear, it also promotes self-empowerment, courage, not giving up, and following one's dreams even when things get rough. But don't get me wrong - it's not a book that over-preaches. Written as a fable, The Alchemist delivers its philosophical messages via the tale of a young shepherd boy who gives everything up everything he knows to follow a dream he's had about buried treasure in Egypt. Despite setback after setback and an expected fear of the unknown, the young boy learns to read the \\"soul of the world,\\" how to trust in its signs, listen to his heart, and does indeed find his treasure. Whether this treasure is truly at the end or along its journey is likely a point to be disputed, as during his tumultuous journey, he makes friends, meets the woman of his dreams, changes the lives of others, and meets an alchemist who teaches him the wisdom of the world. This part of the treasure is more metaphysical as opposed to the material riches the boy finds at the end of the book.    The beauty of this tale lies in its simplicity. There is no underlying heavy-handed message. Instead, the unique combination of mysticism with its fairy-tale-like approach delivers the author's inspirational and philosophical messages in simple but meaningful allegory. In the end, the boy learns that life is in the journey and not in the destination, and what he has gained in loss or adversity along the way makes him better for it. A strong believer of following your dreams, considering I am on a chaotic path of pursuing my own, I would rate The Alchemist four and a half out of five stars, if only for the inspiration, the passion, and the drive to continue to seek what I want out of life. Great little book with many interesting layers, The Alchemist will not disappoint.    Check out my profile info for my website and other reviews.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|this movie is fantastic! I can't wait to watch it again! there are a few moments that feel weird sure, but keep in mind Square Enix has a vary different way of telling stories. it's hard to place a finger on what makes it different. but you will understand what I mean when you watch it, maybe it's just part of being a story that was translated to English. The main point to my review is.. just because you haven't played FF7 and may not know anything about it.. DOES NOT MEAN you won't like it. all I knew about the FF7 series was that the main hero was Cloud before I watched this.
0439023521|5.0|I am an adult, and I loved this book. I went on a business trip recently so I had a little down time to read (have 2 small kids at home, reading does not happen alot) I read this book on the plane there and read the second one on the plane ride home. The third one should be coming in the mail today. They are very entertaining reads.
0061537969|5.0|The best book I have read this year!  For anyone who has had a best friend with four legs this is a must read!  Definately gives you a new perspective on life!

B0036OS3HY|5.0|These boots are lightweight and comfortable.  They are terrific for rain and snow. If you live in an area where it snows you will appreciate the fact that the adjustable tie keeps the snow out. I bought the yellow; they are cute and get a lot of compliments.
0596101996|2.0|For a book which calls itself \\"the definitive guide\\" I was hoping for a much longer and more lucid explanation of OOP in Javascript, prototypes and patterns of how to use them. Prototypes are a key part of Javascript but this is an OOP construct different from the class paradigm familiar to most developers. In a book of 990 pages you'd think that more then a cursory 30 pages would be warranted to explain such a key concept. Having read this section about three times now I think the author simply does not have a deep understanding of this key concept and how important it is to learning this language. The examples in this section even though they are short are far from self-explanatory since they   use the exact language magic they are trying to explain. Also there are no diagrams of any sort and they would have really helped here.  Also in a 990 page book you'd think a this is how javascript is different from major languages table (at least Java...)    Btw this book is thick and heavy! Definitely not for dropping into the briefcase for casual reading on the train.    Since this is relevant to the perspective on a tech book: I have a CS education and 20 years dev experience.
037582913X|4.0|My kids freak out over this book every time we read it. I try to use the Grover voice and get all intense like him, which sends them over the top. As for me, I do get bored sometimes with the repetition. But it is actually worth it in the end. It's also fun to see kids grow up and start to understand it better.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Very pleased with this unit. I like the fact that it displays \\"now playing\\" information on the radio. The ability to store 4 stations is a plus for those living in locations with a congested FM dial. Sound quality is good and I haven't experienced any static problems like some others have mentioned. It is compact and doesn't sit so proud of the dashboard that it's likely to get knocked about. Finally, it can address a lot of music in 99 folders and 1999 songs on a 32GB thumb drive.    My complaints are minor:    1) I would like an on/off button on the remote. For short drives around town you'll be turning it on and off a lot. There are buttons on the remote that are a lot less useful than a power button.   2) It only sends two screenfuls of song information and one screenful of musician info. It would be nice to see the ENTIRE title and artist scroll across your radio instead of just the first 2-3 words.  3) Among the things it broadcasts to the radio is SATECHI in all capital letters. It's annoying to see a unit that you've already purchased advertise itself -- over and over and over again.    All in all, I'm pleased to have it and it's better and more versatile than any other 12v FM transmitter that I've found.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] is an odd, friendless boy who dreams of killing the bullies at school and keeps a scrapbook of murder and carnage. One dark night he meets a girl, Eli [Lina Leandersson], in the playground. Eli says she can't be his friend, but is lonely, too. Night after night they meet in the playground, and their friendship grows. They gain each other's trust and tell one another their secrets. Oskar, that he's bullied at school, Eli, that she's a vampire.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is perfect balance of a vampire movie and a coming of age film. Intelligent and complex, it explores the challenges of growing up as well as the struggles of the lonely vampire. Excellent performances all around, but Kare Hedebrandt is particularly good as Oskar, giving a nuanced performance as he is, by turns, drawn to his new-found friend and frightened away by her true nature.<br /><br />Let the Right One in will appear to those inside the horror community and beyond.
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|This movie is rated PG-13 for sexual content, don't worry about that because it should be for the SLIGHT gore.<br /><br />What can I say?<br /><br />Suspenseful!  Mysterious!  Heart-Pounding!  Twister!  Thriller!<br /><br />I don't like telling the actual contents of a movie; but this one will make you go -- Hhhmmm, what if??  On a daily basis, there are things that occur that we shrug off as weird, after seeing this movie................you may be asking yourself, \\"Am I where I am supposed to be?\\"  We may not take our daily sins so casually after viewing this movie.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is about the DEVIL --- SATAN himself.  How IT comes is up to YOU!!  Basically, you will find that this movie may help you to pay MORE attention to your everyday surroundings.  IT comes in ALL disguises and they may be subtle characters or obvious creature linked to your everyday existence.  Regardless, BE CAREFUL in LIFE is basically what this movie is about.  You NEVER know where you destiny lies but at least this gives you an opportunity to learn that NOBODY is PERFECT but if you own up to your mistakes, you can certainly be forgiven by GOD.<br /><br />SEE it but NOT alone.<br /><br />BUY, BUY, BUY, you may want to see it again with your friends, family and neighbors......whomever, be sure to get a religious advocate of any denomination.<br /><br />Get your snacks and drinks BEFORE you press PLAY!
1926778103|4.0|I bought this book because I'm a big fan of Joe Madureira and the artwork portrayed in here is just great. Being an artist myself I really enjoy seeing concept sketches and the thought process behind the overall look of the game, particularly character design.  If you like comic book artwork you will really like this book and even more so if you like Joe Madureira's work.    As much as I like the book I could not give it 5 stars because of the way the book is bound. The binding is not good at all and I'm always afraid to open the pages completely because it feels like te pages will come right off. All the pages of my book are still in place but I'm always extra careful handling the book. I wish they had done a beeter job in that regards, other than that it is a great artwork book.

I enjoyed the book mostly for the good tips it gave me about being innovate and unique, no matter what.<br /><br />I think the book describes a real Mr. Jobs, a person you can love or hate, but you can't deny him a place in history as one of the big ones.<br /><br />I do recommend this book.

B002ZG99NG|1.0|What kind of accent was it that Ben Affleck was using in the first minutes of the movie?  And then what did it change to?  The acting was unconvincing in other ways, too, as if neighbors getting together and making a play.  The F bomb was dropped every two seconds like seventh graders, but I didn't feel any of the grit you would really find in the city.  So many machine guns fired but nobody was hit! When \\"Doug\\" says \\"Let me explain!\\"  What was he going to explain??  Luckily the girl says, \\"No, Leave!\\"  so he doesn't have to say anything!! Instead he just backs away out the door.  And then there she is again in that damn pea patch.  And oops! I guess she just decided to quit her job as bank manager.  Not to mention the whole morality issues in this movie.  The main character is somehow supposed to be a \\"good guy\\" but he's NOT a good guy! You can't just beat people with pipes and shoot them with machine guns over and over and rob so many banks and be a good guy just because your mother left you when you were 6  and you gifted a skating rink with the stolen money!  The whole movie just got on my nerves.  I don't understand it's being so well acclaimed.  I just don't get it. I didn't like it at all!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have loved Adele since '19' and this is even better. When I heard 'Rolling in the Deep' for the first time I knew the entire album was an instant buy. As you listen to the album you can feel the stages of grief and recovery she is going through after the heartache of the breakup that led to this album. Her voice is true and powerful throughout and that is the best part. You can literally feel the pain, heartache, passion and love in the songs. We are missing that in a lot of what is on the radio today. Anyone that has a heart can relate to this album. Simply said it is amazing and I would buy it over and over.

The book is true to the original, keeping all salient plot points as well as lesser but defining moments It also pays close attention to developing Scrooge's character over the course of the evening. In fact, I found all the characters to be well written, as at times, in other adaptations some can be over done (Christmas Present, Fezziwig, Fred, etc.) The illustrations are artistic in style and match the tone of the book. I'm not too fond of some of the facial elements but that's just me vs. the artistic style. The facial close-ups are more appealing to me aesthetically than the mid scene ones. An impressive read for my first foray into Campfire's line of Graphic Novels.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm glad I didn't know what this book was going to be about because I probably wouldn't have read it- I don't normally like dystopian, violent stuff. But this book is so much more than that: it has action, adventure, love, growth. Instead of being depressing, it captivates you. I read this first book in one night and afterward I realized I'm going to continue reading Young Adult fiction for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Drawing on the story of Theseus, the book has many smart characters all constantly adapting to survive. The protagonist Katniss is strong, independent, and resourceful. Her irreverent voice is hilarious, making you laugh even when you're ready to cry or when your heart is pounding in suspense. Everything is so intelligently written, nothing simply gratuitous. The fighting is described intelligently and caused me to strategize about how I'd behave in the same situation. Fashion also plays a surprisingly important role in the story, beautiful but also with strategic value in conveying ideas. There were just so many different elements, all creative and interesting.<br /><br />This series has one of the strongest narrative arcs I've read in a long time. I rarely read more than 1 book of a series because after the first book I often feel I know what's going to happen next, and I feel like most of the world has been revealed so there's not many new ideas left. This series is different. Even though I succumbed to my bad habit of googling the remaining plot, I was as surprised and riveted by books 2 and 3 as I was by book 1. Katniss changes from focusing on her own survival to fighting for her community and an idea of freedom. While book 1 focuses on Katniss battling tooth and nail for her own survival, in the other books the conflict changes to include Katniss and her friends vs Panem, Katniss sacrificing herself and her own desires for her loved ones and for her ideals. It also has a love story that Collins has brilliantly integrated into the central plot so that it's powerful and moving rather than predictable or absurd. This is not a book where the characters get together by the end of the first book after some misunderstanding and then live happily ever after- they go through a lot.<br />I loved this book and I wish I could give it more stars.s powerful and moving rather than predictable or absurd.

1402210795|3.0|I've read about ten of Georgette Heyer's books now, and I'd have to say this is one of my least favorite.  While it contains the wonderful characterization and witty dialogue that I've come to know her for, I had trouble with the plot of this one.    I liked the premise, of a young lord impetuously marrying a childhood friend for the purpose of controlling his inheritance, especially with the young woman being inexperienced in London and prone to speaking before she thinks.  And, I did enjoy the first part of the book.  I really enjoyed the girl's interaction with her husband's friends.  This book had great potential.    However, the girl's faux pas became too much.  Eventually, I could believe that she might not know that something *was* problematic, but I couldn't believe that she wouldn't realize it was something that *could* be.  It didn't seem like she learned.  Also, the misunderstandings of who loves whom were really overdone and dragged on to long.  The last third of the book became very melodramatic with kidnapping, mistaken identity, etc, etc.  With any other writer, I'd have put it down.  It's a credit to Heyer's skill that I was able to still enjoy her writing skill, even as I was occasionally rolling my eyes at the overblown plot.    I will not be reading this one again, and will not be keeping it.  My favorite Georgette Heyer books which I would recommend instead are [[ASIN:0848823176 A Civil Contract]] (out of print), [[ASIN:1402217706 The Nonesuch]], and [[ASIN:1402219482 The Foundling]].

B001UV4XWY|4.0|An \\"alien\\" group is bound to test the souls of<br />the unsuspecting through the tried-and-true method<br />of greed further placating their twisted need<br />for corrupted souls.<br /><br />Their power is omnipotent through the system,<br />easily enabling them to manipulate their targets<br />into financial hardship, thus making their offer<br />all the more appealing.<br /><br />Rationalization sadly outweighs logic and Eve<br />presses the button, falling prey like so many<br />others before her. The blood sacrifice is made<br />and the vicious cycle continues. Drones are sent<br />out by the hordes gravitating to their victims,<br />prodding them along the predestined path, ultimately<br />leading to a choice of visiting the wrath upon oneself<br />or on one's child; a choice coinciding with another's<br />whose hand is near the button. A collective or<br />individual choice?<br /><br />The mastermind/puppet claims that it's for the<br />betterment of mankind. It's evil in the guise of<br />humanitarianism with the aim of weeding out the<br />spiritually weak.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I originally read the first chapter in the New York Times book review online, and I was hooked.  It took me several months to feel like I was in the right state of mind, and had a few days to devote to reading Room without too much distraction.  I could have easily read this in one sitting, but managed to stretch it out over 3 days.      It is impossible to watch the news and not imagine yourself in the victim's situation.  This book gives an inside perspective of living in captivity from the view of a 5 year old.  Except he doesn't know he is captive.  His mother's survival skills and his bright mind and creativity create an entire universe in an 11 ft. x 11 ft. room.  Everything in an animate object - Chair, Table, Wardrobe, Rug, etc., and Jack has a relationship with everything he comes in contact with.  He lives in every moment.    After their \\"scave\\" and heroic escape, Jack and Ma seem almost more captive in the Outside world.  Phsyical and psychological events unfold in both heartbreaking and uplifting ways.      This novel explores themes of identity, relationship, survival, consciousness, and our makes us examine our own perspective of our \\"Room\\".

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele keeps getting better. I wish I could sing like she does, she is so amazing. 21 is an album that will be on repeat. She became successful at a young age, and she sure deserves it. Her voice gives me the chills. I couldn't wait for this to come out, it feels like it's been along time waiting. This album was worth the wait. Maybe this album will be in my top favorite 40 albums of the year. On some songs like Someone Like You, her voice reminds me of Fiona Apple. I recommend getting the deluxe version of this album, it's worth the extra cost. The live bonus songs show her amazing voice even more. Adele is a shining star. My favorite songs on this album are:<br />1. Someone Like You<br />2. Don't You Remember<br />3. Take it All<br />4. Turning Tables<br />5. He Won't Go

B0049OSQ18|5.0|Awesome band! Usually their albums are a mix of great folk/americana stuff you can crank up for your friends and stuff that's probably a little farther off the beaten pop path but still intriguing at minimum. This album finds them at their most accessible and I would be shocked to not see this propel them into even greater notoriety. The dramatic elements to their writing can still be found but it sounds less labored. Like they just sat down without an agenda other than to enjoy themselves and hit the record button. As always the musicianship is superb and CM's vox remain enchanting. Someone get me their tour schedule- I want to be a Decemberists-Head!

0061765236|4.0|This is the story of Emily Gold and Chris Harte and their respective families. The Golds moved next door to the Heartes and Em and Chris became fast friends sharing everything, from family vacations, to homework assignments. When Em and Chris turn 13 their close friendship turns into something more, which makes their parents very happy indeed since they had pictured Em and Chris together forever.<br />As time passes Chris  realizes he wants Em and that only makes him love her more; Chris envisions their relationship very differently from Emily since he has bought into his parents'expectations while Emily hasn't. For Emily its the sexuality that hurts her beyond her own understanding.<br />One midnight the calls from the Hospital shatter everything that these families had built. Emily and Chris have been hurt but Emily dies in the ER from a gunshot to the head, inflicted by Chris as part of an apparent suicide pact. Chris tells the police that the 2nd bullet was meant for him but this is not true, Chris never wanted to die, he wasn't suicidal at all.<br />The trial is just thrilling and full of suspense, Chris'lawyer is simply outstanding at what he does and as the truth unfolds you will feel for Chris who gave his heart and his life for Em not knowing that her love for him was definitely lacking. She was pregnant with their child and never told him and she made him help her end her own life which is simply the worst thing anyone can do to someone..... This story makes you think of how much you really know your kids and how hard it can be to create bridges to stay in tune with what your own flesh and blood are going through. Simply riveting.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I typically don't like work out videos, I would much prefer to go to the gym.  Since having children, the gym is no longer an option (budget or time-wise).  This is a WONDERFUL alternative and I enjoy doing it.  For a while I did the P90X program.  It made a huge difference for me and my body, but an hour or more 6 nights a week wasn't manageable.  I am able to push hard and make this workout extremely effective AND I can do it in the morning before the kids wake up, leaving my evenings free to enjoy.      It does not require a lot of equipment (I use 3 or 5 lb hand-weights and a mat).  It provides 3 levels and recommendations in each level to raise or lower the intensity.  That way each workout can be as hard or easy as you want, but still effective.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good, quick workout.  Just be cautious and follow proper form.  As with any workout...injuries can come if you aren't careful with your form.  Thankfully Jillian reminds you of proper form a lot during the video.

B004GHYCKW|5.0|This record is a continuing piece in PJ Harvey's evolution as an artist.From the abrasive power of Rid of Me to the atmospheric beauty of Is This Desire? to the intricate and fragile stylings of White Chalk, PJ has never strived to be repetitive  .For her latest record Let England Shake, she has transformed once more. She continues to sing in the higher pitch of her voice as she did in White Chalk, but here, her voice is more animated due to the content of the material. One cannot discuss this record without referencing to the lyrics. Harvey conveys strong images of war, death, and unease that is relevant to the present times yet still applicable  to conflicts of the past.A few songs reference to the Gallipoli campaign of WWI.  Despite the heavy lyrical content, the music itself is a myriad of moods:jovial,  whimsical,somber, and even danceable.And coupled with Harvey's childlike delivery,  Let England Shake creates an interesting atmosphere and her most esoteric to date.As  with most of PJ's work, Let England Shake is not for everyone and will even be jarring for some fans who yearn for a return to her early work, but overall, this is  a strong piece of work that shows Harvey's lyrical strength and limitless potential.
1594488843|1.0|I just cannot justify paying double the price for the Kindle version.  I love Kindle books and I love this author and have heard some great things about the book.  This site has some very good to excellent reviews.  But I do think it wrong to charge more for the Kindle version.  I guess I won't be buying this one until the price is reduced.  I have bought a really, really lot of books from Amazon over the years many at full price, and of course, when I can find a bargain book I purchase.  Based on my prior experience with this author and on the things I've heard I would rate it at least 3 stars until I've read the entire book, but based on the price I'm rating 1 star.  The publisher should re-think the pricing.
B003UESJFG|3.0|I'm not saying this movie was horribly but this almost has a 5 star rating. We went to the theaters to watch this and we were super excited to take our kids to this movie. On top of that I am a huge Will fan. The movie had it's funny moments but overall to me and my wife was boring. The characters were great mostly but there was just something missing to keep me into the movie. I found myself about halfway through hoping it was going to end soon. I am still debating whether to buy this or not. As a reference I buy ALOT of movies but I am lacking the motive to actually buy the disc so I can't help you out with the extras in the disc.<br /><br />WARNING - You cannot even buy the 3D version yet. It will be a pack in exclusive. Most likely to a 3D tv. If you want the 3D version your gonna have to buy another copy later.
B001P1FZDK|5.0|I had never heard of Animal Collective before until my brother made me listen to this CD. I was moved to say the least...    I really thought the first 3 songs (In the Flowers, My Girls, Also Frightened) were the best. I also like \\"Taste\\" and \\"Brother Sport\\". However, the other songs on the CD did seem to understate the songs I already mentioned. Overall, I gave this album 5 stars because it flows beautifully, and because there are 5 songs on it that make it worth more than the album already costs. Can't wait to hear all of their previous stuff!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele 21.......joyful, masterful, simply the best CD I have bought in years.  With all the overly computerized vocals going on (GaGa, Katy, Ke$ha, Britney)  Adele gives you her real, honest and soulful voice.  Every song is perfectly written and even though I have no musical production experience it is obvious to me that Adele and her team produced this entire CD to the highest degree possible.  There is nothing sloppy or rushed about any of the songs.  When I buy a CD I spend my hard earned money to hear the vocals (which are pure) and the music (which is flawless).  Adele is the real deal.  This CD is better than 19 not because 19 was a bad compilation of music but because she has grown and matured like anyone who works hard to perfect their craft would.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!
B003YBNREI|5.0|Being a Doobie fan I love this album.  It brings back the old sound and the selections are great.  The only negative here is that you have to buy the deluxe edition to get the 2 bonus tracks.  There's always a gimmick to get us to spend more money. The bonus tracks, by the way, are excellent.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Been listening to the blues for a long time with emphasis on the electric side.  \\"Living Proof\\" is proof that 74 Years Young Buddy Guy is a living legend.  I was hooked on this CD from the first listen and been playing it over and over since.  One of Mr. Buddy Guy's finest achievements...
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I loved the original show and I actually love this one more. Yeah, sure, they've put in a young cast. Actually that's more like youngER. That, however, doesn't really matter much. The way in how the actors work together on-screen is amazing. It's almost like one big actor with a bunch of smaller parts acting as a whole.   I'm also glad to see that Alex hasn't lost any of his touch from the Moonlight series; he's as good as I expected him to be. Scott Caan plays an original Dano with some good humor and character that compliments Alex's. The rest of the cast is top notch as well.  I understand that some people just don't like certain things, but I am amazed that this show actually got a 1-star rating from someone. However, I will not put down an honest review, and I thank you for your input.  Loved every episode, and I can't wait to get the full season on Blu-ray.
141694737X|4.0|My 19 month old son LOVES this book.  He likes lifting the flaps and turning the pages, and never gets bored with the book.  The only problem I've found with it is that a I don't know how long it'll last -- the lion flap, in particular, is already bending because of the cut-outs in the flap, so I'm guessing it'll die soon. Also, one of the flaps was not well cut, and to open it initially, we had to rip it a bit to get it unstuck.  Minor inconveniences for an otherwise wonderful book.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Buddy is allowed to play like Buddy does when you see him live. All the energy comes through on this cd. I have been a Buddy Guy fan and frequent visitor to his nightclub, Legends, in Chicago. I feel like I am sitting in his club listening to him play. Highly recommended for fans old and new.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|Great mix of acoustic and electric songs. You can hear in Gregg's voice that he doesn't just sing the blues. He lives the blues. A cd that you will play over and over and come away with a different awareness of his dedication to his music. Glad he is back. His music makes his feelings become a part of your feelings

1593272200|5.0|I pre-ordered this book back in Sept 2010 and received just days before my honeymoon and while the wife didn't let me bring my laptop, she let me bring this book!  I don't think I could have picked a better book to carry around 8000 miles. :)<br /><br />This book is simply the best Linux programming book since Stevens' Unix programming books. It is very current covering the recent 2.6 kernel updates and SUSv4 specification.  This book is an awesome 64 chapters of just about every aspect of Linux systems programming you can think of.<br /><br />It has great coverage of the file system API, pthreads, socket programming, virtual memory, and so much more.  I'm more of a server developer, so I was pleased to find daemons and advanced socket I/O covered in detail, especially the epoll() API.<br /><br />This book is pure C, so you won't find any C++ or STL, but that's actually a good thing because it keeps the examples really simple. And of course the APIs described work just fine with C++. :)<br /><br />The only thing this book is missing is possibly an appendix on gdb and valgrind. It does however have an appendix on strace. This book doesn't cover Autotools, so you may want to pick up a copy of [[ASIN:1593272065 Autotools: A Practioner's Guide to GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool]], which is also published by No Starch Press.<br /><br />I seriously recommend this book to anybody who is interested in Linux programming. I recommend buying both the print and ebook versions so you don't have to carry this 5.1 pound book around, but it is nice to be able to mark up the book.  Go buy this book!

Every song on this CD is disjointed, some so badly that I cannot listen to them.  She has beautiful choruses with moving melodies, but then right in the middle of a great ride she puts the brakes on and stops dead...and you wonder what the hell - is this the same song??    And her mumbling in some parts is ridiculous.  There is some great PARTS of songs here...I just wish she had not seen fit to slice them up and slip in the limp pieces.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|From beginning to end, this cast captivates. Alfie Boe in particular sweeps viewers off their feet wtih his powerful yet sweet voice. Similarly, Lea Salonga, Katie Hall, and Norm Lewis are all amazing in their roles. Nick Jonas, while not up to par with the other stage regulars, is not as bad as most will make him out to be, and his performance of \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" is actually quite good.     This is a must buy for fans of the musical.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|What happens when you inject an ingenious artificial intelligent (AI) system into a globally omniscient social and economic network? In the case of SUMMER WARS, you get a poignant and quite possibly prescient cautionary tale.     Mamoru Hosada's animated tale is framed by the extended Jinnouchi clan-- an aristocratic Japanese family-- preparing to celebrate their matriarch's 90th birthday. We enter as great-granddaughter Natsuki invites classmate Kenji Koiso (high school math whiz, antihero protagonist) under the pretense that he's her finance. Given hints of the family's deep civic and professional roots in Japan's military industrial complex and their everyday social networking, a few profound chance events converge into an apocalyptic showdown-- pitting ancient family values against nascent social networks.     It impressively interweaves the kind of endearing humane drama one expects of Studio Ghibli with the fantastically rendered conflicts that emerge from the best Japanese science fiction animation. Unlike most Disney/ Pixar films, the results are wonderfully ambivalent.     -----     What makes the film especially poignant are a handful of recent events. This week nascent, omnipresent social media (Facebook(tm), Twitter®) are being credited with helping to foster grassroots uprisings-- in Egypt, Bahrain, Tunisia, Libya, Jordan, Yemen and Morocco-- potentially undermining generations of region-wide autocratic rule. Simultaneously Watson, IBM's artificial intelligent system, effortlessly defeated his human opponents on Jeopardy. Expanding Deep Blue's earlier footsteps.     Are these conjoined systems nefarious precursors to Kubricks's HAL2000, the Matrix's Agent Smith and the Terminator franchise's Skynet or benign one's like Pixar's WALL-E, STAR TREK TNG's Commander Data and Spielberg's David (in A.I.)? Either way, we are on the cusp of a new age.
081297381X|2.0|Ten years after writing Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Taleb's thinking has not matured much. Making a tidy sum after the financial crises didn't give him the confidence to advance anything truly ground-breaking in the Black Swan, a distressingly palatable work fraught with American--nay, New York--ideology.<br /><br />It didn't occur to me that the Black Swan is part of Taleb's branding scheme until he came up with a book of aphorisms last year. The man enjoys the limelight, and slapping together bits of the latest thinking (behavioral finance and cognitive mush) and sprinkling in a bit of German philosophy has made him a fixture of the New York intellectual scene. Despite his professed disdain for journalists, he spends a lot of time in their company, on screen and off. His work is safe and careful not to offend our sacred ideologies despite the affectedly acrid tone. I was really hoping Taleb would become a 21st-century Nietsche, but he is just another talking head with a lot of good points.<br /><br />I suppose the Black Swan is worth reading if you haven't read much philosophy. If you have, read only the meatier chapters on finance. It is annoying that he takes so much ex cathedra from other authors, particularly his friend Malcolm Gladwell.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|A couple of things to note.<br /><br />I rated LEGEND and THE HARDER THEY COME as the #1 and #2 greatest reggae albums of all time, largely but not entirely because of their historical precedence.  Their creation led to other breakthroughs for other artists and the genre as a whole.<br /><br />Any album in the Top 5 could easily have been voted as Best Reggae album of all time because of merit alone.  And, it's not an exclusively Bob Marley domain.  Before we reach album #20, we will have undoubtedly covered all of Bob's studio albums from the Island years, but also the first five albums from STEEL PULSE, and a couple from BURNING SPEAR.<br /><br />But in truth, the way music critics have debated who is the Best Rock Group of all time, it's always narrowed down to THE BEATLES or THE ROLLING STONES.  These lists are subjective, I know that but I submit my imperfect ranking to the same consideration.<br /><br />Just as TIME MAGAZINE rated EXODUS as the \\"GREATEST ALBUM OF THE CENTURY,\\" there seems no debate as another better.  Maybe a few equal, but none better.  I weighed what is my favorite and at times it is TRUE DEMOCRACY  (by Steel Pulse) at other times, it's KAYA or UPRISING or any number of albums that I'll repeat-play just because it brings me to euphoria.  What about albums that are no longer in print, but are very well known?

B004FLIXVS|5.0|Pearl Jam's fourth formal live release (not counting the official bootlegs) is not as strong as 'Live on Two Legs,' but it does have the best versions of 'Rearview Mirror,' 'Porch,' 'Nothing As It Seems,' and 'In Hiding.' Matt Cameron's drumming on these songs is incredible and the whole band comes together with vigor and energy feeding off each other and taking these tracks to a whole new level of musical brilliance.     Live on Ten Legs is also a refreshing compilation, and you'll be glad some of their live staples such as 'Corduroy' don't appear on this album yet again - particularly if you've been buying the official bootlegs and Ten Club releases like many fans do. Other great performances on this album include 'Animal,'Spin The Black Circle (when was the last time you heard that one live?), and 'I Am Mine.' The only downside is that the numbers from Backspacer clearly pale in comparison with songs from their other albums.
9626344679|5.0|My wife and I are very, very dedicated Jane Austen fans. Of her five literary novels, Mansfield Park is our favorite for its blend of depth, seriousness, and humour --with of course, Jane Austen's matchless prose and attention to detail. Furthermore, Juliet Stevenson's reading is absolutely exquisite. We have four of Jane Austen's novels on audio CD, and Ms. Stevenson's is the best reading we have heard.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|It's hard to find an album that's more than just one or two hits and a lot of filler.  This, however, is a complete effort.  After listening to it several times you realize that the album would be incomplete if any of the songs where missing.  Great music, excellent musicians and a mesmerizing voice.  There is not a glimmer of hype in this performance. I have often sat in my car just listening to these songs long after I have arrived at my destination.
0553805371|3.0|I appreciate what the authors are doing to introduce M-theory, string theory, and other recent theories in quantum and astrophysics. I am by no means an expert, and at some points in the book I admit to being a bit lost, despite my best efforts. I find some of these newer theories fascinating, but I still am struggling to understand how Hawking and Mlodinow can simultaneously use the term \\"design\\" in the book's title while disavowing a \\"design-er\\". I'm not trying to argue for the existence of God, but I didn't appreciate how quickly the authors dismissed religion and mythos as the backwards folk traditions of a superstitious age. Perhaps the nature of the target audience didn't allow them to further explain their position, but discarding these ancient ideas without adequate attention to them comes off as flippant and perhaps evidence of the authors' lack of understanding of these disciplines. Additionally, at one point they claim that modern philosophy no longer attempts to tackle the big questions of \\"why\\", and then claim that science has stepped in to do the job. I was dismayed to realize that these two brilliant men of science were making huge assumptions and errors about the nature, currency, and importance of religious and philosophical tradition. Ironic, for their book invites the reader to take on another set of theories and propositions that cannot be observed or consciously experienced as the \\"truth\\" about \\"reality\\". In short, they invite the reader to believe in something they cannot see, feel, or even truly contemplate (11 dimensions, multiple universes, and other mind-bending concepts, for example). In the end, the transcendence of science ends up feeling a lot like the transcendence of what others have been calling \\"God\\" for thousands of years.

038572179X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Atonement; once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. It's incredibly well-written, with interesting and complex characters, an engaging plot, and fascinating description & historical detail. The final chapter hit me like a ton of bricks -- that was when I realized how emotionally invested I'd become in the novel. All in all, it's an excellent book and I'd highly recommend it.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Having read many of the other books out there on the Kim Il-Sung / Kim Jong-Il regime, this book was really refreshing. If you thought The Aquariums of Pyongyang was a good but unbalanced read, you'll be happy with Barbara Demick's effort here. She interviewed many North Korean defectors but ended up focusing on the lives of a handful of people and their families- all from the same city far from where the elite live comparatively well in Pyongyang. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, the mark of a great writer is to bring the main characters to life and the author does that superbly here. She fleshes them out to such an extent that you begin to feel you know these people. Not surprisingly, you then begin to like them and care what happens to them. I found myself cheering them on and hoping that they got out and made a fresh start with their lives. Sadly, while many of them did escape the madness and inhumanity of North Korea, not all of them managed to and I found myself genuinely feeling sorrow as I read about them as well.<br /><br />It's a harrowing book, but one that assigns the face of humanity to a people who live in a country most of us don't associate with humanity. Lastly, the author does a good job of describing how it is that people who are treated so cruelly by their government would still fall to the ground weeping uncontrollably at the death of their leader Kim Il-Sung. In other books I've read this is glossed over as the people acting out of fear, etc. but Demick does a great job of describing from a psychological standpoint how it is that these people were essentially brainwashed from birth.

B003Q6D25K|3.0|Allow me to start by saying I'm in the camp of people who loved the first Paranormal Activity. If, however, you *didn't* enjoy the first one, then this one will be an absolute snooze-fest for you, so look elsewhere.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know, this is a prequel to the first movie -- but only by a margin of weeks, which I think is pretty cool. Katie and Micah are both in this movie -- Katie, much more so -- but neither one gets much screen time (maybe 10-15 minutes total). The format of the movie holds true to the approach in the first: You get a sense of the family and who they are when unaffected by demonic possession, then things happen over the course of the rest of the movie which end in a dramatic cliffhanger of sorts. The main difference in this movie is that you don't have to wait very long to see the family deal with something strange, but they don't start putting things together until later when things happen more frequently. Likewise, instead of one camera, you see things happen via security cameras (which, as you will see in the movie, have a reason for being installed) and a hand-held camera. Lastly, there are many more nights in which the totality of events happen in this movie than in the first, but I rather enjoyed that.<br /><br />Now, as for my total enjoyment of the movie... well, let's just say I was ultimately underwhelmed. I was entertained and the moments of normal family time were enjoyable to watch (in other words, the movie didn't drag out for me at all), but the scares came primarily in the form of jump-scares where things happen suddenly and loudly, thus making you jump out of your pants for that split-second. For as much as I was personally affected by the first movie after watching it, I was expecting at least some sort of rehash of that experience after seeing this second movie, but alas, I walked away unaffected from the experience.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched the movie and I will certainly catch the 3rd installment this year, but I won't be seeing Paranormal Activity 2 again on my own accord -- and not because it scared me that much. In my humble opinion, I say give Oren Peli another ~$15,000 budget and have him (and *only* him) go to town once more, because he alone accomplished what he + Hollywood clearly could not with their deep pockets: A sense of realism and intrigue that grips a person and chills them to the bone with an experience that lasts far outside the boundaries of the span of time of the movie itself. Perhaps that is due to how much Peli left to the viewer's imagination in Paranormal Activity versus everything Hollywood gave visual affirmation to here in Paranormal Activity 2. With that said, I did enjoy the continuation of -- and additional historicity within -- the storyline.<br /><br />Overall, if you liked the first installment, I recommend you see this installment if you have yet to. The development of the storyline and the way they end this movie all ties into the first movie and sets the stage for the third installment in a manner that I'm looking forward to seeing the continuation/conclusion of. Just don't expect to go to bed the night you watch this movie and feel like something is just waiting to pull you out of bed, drag you down the hall and make a snack out of you before possessing you -- at least, not like you felt after watching it happen in the first movie. =)<br /><br />-Stephenseeing Paranormal Activity 2 again on my own accord -- and not because it scared me that much.

B003EY9V0O|3.0|I did not care for this movie. It was a nice plot, but many songs were long, some unbearably so. It was a long wait to see what would happen next.    I would not recommend this movie for kids, unless you want a movie that gets them bored. I wish I hadn't spent my money on this. At least the library will get a book / movie sale donation out of it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Not one bad song here. Not sure what the 1, 2 and 3 star reviews are all about. But then again, I am over 40 so maybe \\"I just don't get it\\". All I know is I like it. Or as Forrest would say, \\"I like it a lot.\\"
B00005AR3G|5.0|I first saw this movie completely against my will.  I was working as a pre-school teacher and came in for work one day to be informed that I was taking the kids on a field trip.  Upon asking where we were going, I was told I was taking them to a movie.  When I asked what movie we would be seeing and was told The Emperor's New Groove, I immediately started whining, \\"But it looks so STUPID!\\"  When we arrived at the theater and the movie started, I was trying to force myself to be miserable and hate the movie so I could complain when we got back.  As hard as I tried to not like it however, I was soon finding myself enjoying it and ultimately loving it.  As soon as it was released to video, I rushed out and got it and viewed it so many times that I had to purchase a replacement copy.  The character of Kronk alone makes the price of the movie worth every penny (Patrick Warburton has the ultimate voice for the character).  David Spade rules as the emperor (pun may or may not be intended) and John Goodman voiced Pacha perfectly.  All of the actors providing voices here just worked together RRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT.  This is one of those films where anybody else doing the voices would cause for it to not be nearly as good as it was (as proof, watch the Disney Channel show of The Emperor's New School).  For a good laugh the size of a huge waterfall, I recommend picking this one up.  If you liked such mediocre Disney hits as Toy Story, Monsters Inc and Cars, then you'll love this movie.

It shows what can happen when people feel deeply that they have something special to offer the world and work hard at what they love.  She drops plenty of big names, but I wasn't at all put off by it.  She gives the reader a chance to get a look into the art and music scene during that time in NYC.  I'd read it again, but I've sent it to a friend In Australia who was getting his MFA at Pratt and who I'm sure will enjoy it as much as I did.

B00110K62U|5.0|I'm one of the many who appreciate this work; I had the good fortune to see it in person when it was on tour and found that to be a memorable experience. I bought a Laser Disc widescreen version of the 1995 10th Anniversary Performance which I still have and continue to enjoy. I do not have the DVD referenced here so I will confine my comments to the performance with one exception.<br /><br />Having read some of the other reviews I was interested in the references to omissions and deletions in the DVD; this prompted me to compare run times and I found the DVD had a run time of 148 minutes while the Laser Disc version had a run time of 160 minutes. I have not found any references to the VHS tapes run time.<br /><br />The performance elevates this review to an entirely different level; this performance is powerful, disturbing, emotional, and at times, even funny. There are many moments of beauty and drama, and then there is the show-stopping scene, \\"Master of the House\\" featuring Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway that leaves one laughing and applauding.<br /><br />This performance is anchored by Colm Wilkinson's forceful characterization of Jean Valjean. The other leads are also convincingly performed by Philip Quast as Javert, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Lea Salonga as Eponine, Michael Ball as Marius, and Michael Maguire as Enjolras. I did not personally observe and real weaknesses that would distract from the overall production.<br /><br />It was effective the way the performers did not drop out of character during applause; the missing scenery does not really distract from the drama and the strong emotional impact of this production.<br /><br />After watching this performance my wife and I find ourselves haunted by the beautiful melodies for days afterward; we have to limit our exposure to this work simply because it is so powerful!<br /><br />I would love to have the complete stage presentation on video but it does not appear that will happen anytime soon. In the meantime this is a choice way to enjoy the music and the excellent performances by all parties to this production.way to enjoy the music and the excellent performances by all parties to this production.

B000E6EGX2|5.0|The piano as we know it today did not exist for Bach. We do know he was aware of the recently invented pianoforte and there is evidence he owned an example built by Stein. Would he have endorsed playing the Goldberg variations on piano instead of the more readily available harpsichord? People have been posing this question ever since Tureck and Gould recorded them in the 1950's. These questions need not bother the modern music lover. There is no argument about the ability to vary dynamics on the modern piano so right there you have the answer. There is frankly more expression possible on piano than harpsichord or clavichord.<br /><br />With that decided, who do you turn to for the best rendition on piano? I can't answer that definitively because the answer can't exist. People's tastes vary widely and when it comes to music, it is even harder to come to complete consensus. Do rest assured that with Andras Schiff, you are going to hear a recording by one of the best. Schiff specializes in Classical and Romantic period music. He has performed and successfully recorded Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann. He is not generally thought of as a Bach specialist like Angela Hewitt or the late Rosalyn Tureck or Glenn Gould. Yet he has recorded parts of complete versions of other Bach works including the English Suites and Two + Three Part Inventions as well as single Fantasies. His ability to play these works is aided by superb technique, excellent tempo choices, natural feel and dynamics. Music through his interpretation is alive, expressive and negotiated with smooth and supple fingerwork.<br /><br />Bach's music is always challenging both for listener and artist. His studious contrapuntal approach creates mind bending and finger twisting problems for a player to solve and navigate. One must carefully foster several melodic lines simultaneously carefully marking their entrances and exists while still managing to have the wholeness of the piece make musical sense. To the listener, contrapuntal music can become kalideoscopic and dissolve into a waves of notes that meld together into kinesthetic sounds that are hard to sort out. Listeners sometimes avoid Bach because of these perceived difficulties. It is true that Bach's music can have an academic side. Luckily, the Goldberg variations are one of Bach's most approachable contrapuntal creations. It starts with a simple, gentle sounding song or \\"aria\\" and this is then put through over 30 different permutations. You can hear the original conception in every variation and Bach doesn't take them as far afield as Beethoven does with his theme in his Diabelli Variations. He does vary them in amazing ways though, and it is highly absorbing to experience the scientific and artful ways Bach resets such an apparently naive little tune. By the time it returns at the end, you have been taken on a wild and enthralling roller coaster ride through an encyclopedia of contrapuntal art. In the end, you only have to chew on as much as you feel like because overall the music is never foreign sounding or unwelcome, or far reaching as Bach's \\"Art of the Fugue\\" or even the solo \\"Cello Suites\\". The conception is generally wellcoming because after all, it was written to help a friend deal with his insomnia. This is accessible Bach played with artistry, taste and joy, therefore with an open ear and mind, can be thoroughly enjoyed by all music lovers. Highly Recommended.er, contrapuntal music can become kalideoscopic and dissolve into a waves of notes that meld together into kinesthetic sounds that are hard to sort out.

0553805371|1.0|I tried to plow through this book hoping to find some new insight, but it was never found and I ended up returning the book.  The first part of the book is mostly history of science and the last part is repeating what is \\"popular\\" today regarding m-theory.  You would get a lot more depth by watching some of the videos online by Edward Witten and others.  Like another reviewer here, I was amazed by the statement \\"philosophy is dead\\" - I had to read it a couple of times to believe I was reading it! I cannot recommend this book.  Here is a quote from Einstein with regard to philosophy and science:  \\"How does it happen that a properly endowed natural scientist comes to concern himself with epistemology? Is there not some more valuable work to be done in his specialty? That's what I hear many of my colleagues ask, and I sense it from many more. But I cannot share this sentiment. When I think about the ablest students whom I have encountered in my teaching -- that is, those who distinguish themselves by their independence of judgment and not just their quick-wittedness -- I can affirm that they had a vigorous interest in epistemology. They happily began discussions about the goals and methods of science, and they showed unequivocally, through tenacious defense of their views, that the subject seemed important to them...\\"
B00005N6KG|5.0|My ears must be tiny because earbud headphones do not work for me. They constantly fall out and are not an option for running. I've tried all kinds of headphones - Sony, Nike, etc. The kind that wrap over the ear and behind the head...none of them work. These are perfect. The sound quality isn't the best, but they're light and comfortable and still allow me to hear some road sounds while running. They're also flexible, so don't break in your gym bag. After about a year of heavy use (5x week of sweating), I've found that one ear will often stop working, but at $10 it's not that big a deal to replace them. HIghly recommended for people who hate earbuds.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|My grown sons were shocked that their mom really liked this movie.  Besides being tightly written and extremely well acted by every cast member,  I think the violence of the film is redeemed by it's social commentary.      Yes, there is increasing evidence that \\"criminal minds\\" have a genetic basis.  However crime is often family and culturally determined.  In some communities it is difficult to escape and complicated by drug dependence, parental abandonment and bonds with bad mentors.  Criminals both in and out of prison are as likely to watch this movie as anything else outside the porn genre.  The film is bringing an important commentary to that audience as well.    The car chases and gunfights in the streets of Boston were the only stretch.  Hard to believe for anyone who has driven in the congestion and narrow streets.  Foot chases, better.    I greatly admire the Novelist and Mr. Affleck, the assembled actors  AND...I wish I could personally apologize to Mr. Affleck for that really weird interviewer from Time Magazine's 10 Questions.  I thought I was watching an SNL sketch.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Expectation is everything.  The Buddhists remind us that there is danger in attachment, and so it is with this film.  If you are too strongly attached to one set of ideas regarding Pride and Prejudice, then this film is not for you.  To completely enjoy all it has to offer one must be willing to abandon prefigured expectation.<br /><br />I have been an ardent student and fan of Jane Austen for just over fifty years now and this experience has given me my own set of ideas.  My first encounter with Jane was in a book, not on the screen.  In fact there was only one film of a Jane Austen novel way back then, and that original version of Pride and Prejudice was much more Hollywood than Jane Austen.  If you wanted to read a book you had to have a book, not an e-reader.  Letters were written on paper and went snail mail, and there were no mobile phones or portable computers.  A lot has changed in fifty years, so we must be mindful of the change that has occurred in two-hundred years.  This change is part of the fun of Lost in Austen.<br /><br />As a rule I don't care at all for the current industry of producing Jane Austen \\"sequels\\" although not for the most obvious reason.  Jane Austen has taught me to look for more than just a story when I read any novel.  Most of the \\"sequels\\" are thin and do little more than attempt to capitalize on the perceived \\"romance\\" in the original novels.<br /><br />Lost in Austen is not a \\"sequel\\" nor is it a parody.  It strikes me as being occasionally satirical, but of a certain set of Jane Austen fans, not of Jane's work.  I think we have a mistaken idea of who Jane Austen was, and that largely from the picture her family took great pains to shape for us.  If one reads the six major biographies and the remaining letters (most of the letters were likely destroyed by her family) a fuller picture of Jane emerges.  Jane was not an uptight, isolated, old spinster as has been suggested.  Were Jane to step into our world, she would likely adapt every bit as well as Lost in Austen's Lizzy Bennet does.  It is easier to adapt to a barrage of \\"new\\" things than it is to tolerate a lack of \\"old\\" things we have come to take for granted.  This is one of the messages of the film.<br /><br />It is my firm belief that Jane would seriously enjoy this film once she had adapted to our time and its oddities.  Certainly Amanda Price is profane and crude, as are we all compared to the people of Jane's world.  That is one of the points of the film.  The original novel is often very biting in its criticism, always ironic, occasionally satirical, frequently funny, but rarely romantic.  The other films try to sell us romance, and the better ones also present us with Jane's detail allowing us to see contrasts, folly and conceit.<br /><br />I think some folks object to this film because of multiple factors.  Perhaps they misunderstand Jane.  It seems clear they misunderstand the novels.  They forget that Jane wrote novels not scripture and was hopeful of making money at it.  And finally I think the complainers misunderstand this film.  It does not poke fun at Jane or her novel.  It does clearly poke fun at us, and attempts to remind us all that we should not take her work too seriously after all.  For any who know the novel well, there are many plays in the film on events or dialogue in the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, and do agree that a refresher viewing of the 1995 Colin Firth film is essential as is a thorough understanding of the novel to the greatest enjoyment of it.  Just remember, Coleridge's \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" is also quite helpful to the maximum enjoyment of Lost in Austen.  As a note, I have noticed on IMDB that there seems to be another Lost in Austen in the works for this year.  It will be interesting to see what they do with a second one.in Austen's Lizzy Bennet does.  It is easier to adapt to a barrage of \\"new\\" things than it is to tolerate a lack of \\"old\\" things we have come to take for granted.  This is one of the messages of the film.

Certainly Amanda Price is profane and crude, as are we all compared to the people of Jane's world.  That is one of the points of the film.  The original novel is often very biting in its criticism, always ironic, occasionally satirical, frequently funny, but rarely romantic.  The other films try to sell us romance, and the better ones also present us with Jane's detail allowing us to see contrasts, folly and conceit.    I think some folks object to this film because of multiple factors.  Perhaps they misunderstand Jane.  It seems clear they misunderstand the novels.  They forget that Jane wrote novels not scripture and was hopeful of making money at it.  And finally I think the complainers misunderstand this film.  It does not poke fun at Jane or her novel.  It does clearly poke fun at us, and attempts to remind us all that we should not take her work too seriously after all.  For any who know the novel well, there are many plays in the film on events or dialogue in the book.    I highly recommend this film, and do agree that a refresher viewing of the 1995 Colin Firth film is essential as is a thorough understanding of the novel to the greatest enjoyment of it.  Just remember, Coleridge's \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" is also quite helpful to the maximum enjoyment of Lost in Austen.  As a note, I have noticed on IMDB that there seems to be another Lost in Austen in the works for this year.  It will be interesting to see what they do with a second one.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Amazing film! One of the best of 2010.  Includes an extensive look behind the scenes at pretty much all aspects of the movie:  score composition by Trent Reznor, shooting on location etc.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|This book is fabulous.  Give Amy a chance.  She is trying to do what she was taught in a Western world.  She struggles and ends up learning a lesson in the end.  I went for months without reading because I couldn't find anything worth my time until this book came along.  Great read.
0312600844|4.0|There are many characters and plot threads in this novel, some of which are fun to read and insightful and some of which, unfortunately, are boring, not believable or moralistic.  Some threads, such as the politics of the last lost decade, showed promise but were not fully developed.      I did not come away from this novel thinking \\"he's caught the essence of America during the past couple of decades,\\" which appeared to me to be part of the goal as indicated by the title (what does modern day freedom mean?).      Although I think Franzen bit off a bit more than he could chew, overall I enjoyed the book and there was a lot of truth in it. I believe its successful parts outweighed its unsuccessful ones.

B001NAZWA4|5.0|A couple of the songs from the EP were recorded at Red Rocks, but the majority were recorded at the Lorelei in St. Goarshausen, Germany, an an outdoor amphi-theatre situated along the Rhine River.  I was stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army then and was lucky enough to attend that concert.  Several bands performed that day:  Steve Miller, Joe Cocker, U2, The Stray Cats.  U2 stole the show that day (Joe Cocker was a close second).  From the moment they entered the stage, Bono and the band had the crowd in the palm of their hands.  The most memorable moment was during the final encore song, \\"40\\", when those of us in the crowd continued to sing the refrain \\"How long to sing this song?\\" for several minutes after the band had finally left the stage.  Of all the concerts I've attend over the past 30 plus years, this one stands out as one of the greatest.  If you want to get a taste of this great band performing live in their early days, you owe it to yourself to buy this EP.

1594202842|5.0|This book intrigued me.  I was raised in a pretty stereotypical Asian household, but after reading this book, maybe my family was watered down?      Anyway, I thought this book deserved all the good hype.  I found it very funny, laughing aloud on her stereotypes and exaggerated thinking between Western parenting and Chinese parenting.  And I honestly think she purposely wrote it this way so people can chuckle a bit AT her.  Some of the stuff she wrote in the book, my parents have said to me VERBATIM, even more funny.    For those of you mad at her, why?  She admits that she was harsh unnecessarily, and she had pangs of regrets in saying hurtful things.  It made me think about how I would raise my kids and how to strike a balance between teaching them hardwork and individuality.    And for those of you wondering, yes, I am no Bill Gates, but I think I am successful and not emotionally scarred by what I went through with my parents (but again, they were NOT extreme).  I love my parents and I owe them everything.    Oh, and for those of you who argue that Chinese people have no geniuses, look up David Ho.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought these headphones after reading the reviews on many different sites.  I was a little worried about all the negative complaints people had.  Let me tell you I have had no problems with the headphones.  They have been great!!  My gaming has improved 200%!!  I am 80% deaf in my left ear and usually don't hear a thing while playing but with these headphones I hear all sorts of thing I couldn't before.  I can even tell which direction the sounds are coming from now...couldn't do that before.  I really can't say enough good things about these headphones.    Now for my minor complaints / suggestions for the next model.      Ear Force should have made these so you can plug them in to recharge the batteries.  It would be such an easy thing to do.      When the batteries are going dead the headphones should start making a little beeping sound so you know they are going dead and not just cut off.  This is very annoying in the middle of a game where you can't just stop and replace the batteries.      The headphones do not breathe so my ears tend to get hot.  I am not sure what can be done about this because if you make them breathe then the sound will get out and annoy anyone around you.    They should have wireless connection between the microphone and the controller.    Don't get me wrong...these headphones are great and I would buy them again knowing about these small problems.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|The slow-roasting success of singer/songwriter Adele continues ascendance on \\"21,\\" which shows marked growth from her debut, \\"19.\\" While it lacks a single as radio-friendly as that album's \\"Chasing Pavements,\\" \\"21\\" has an overall stronger song selection and finds the British songstress taking more chances.<br /><br />The majority of the songs don't call attention to themselves, and the lyrical content is about as insightful as can be expected from a young woman still in the flush of youth, with a few strong exceptions. She oozes just as much cool as ardent longing in her alluring, immediately ingratiating voice, however, giving even weaker songs clout and panache. This allows her to carve out a rich, caffeinated niche for herself, in spite of the fact most of the songs themselves are not particularly impressive.<br /><br />Going against the grain of the percussive, tension-bearing lead single \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" \\"21\\" plays as a subdued, often elegant set of songs, ideal for coffee shops and drives home after work, despite the forthright instrumentation and vocal delivery. The witty, meditative \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"He Won't Go\\" command the most notice in terms of sheer grandiosity and memorable pop hooks and are just as strong as \\"Rolling in the Deep.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't You Remember\\" showcases Adele's weaknesses instead of her strengths. The melody is scattered and focus-less, and her vocals are off-pitch and stretched painfully beyond their limits. \\"Set Fire to the Rain,\\" which immediately follows, does the opposite. The melody bubbles over like a furious river in the middle of an arid desert. The production, as with most of the album, is too even-handed, but the song remains uplifting and nothing short of inspired, showing the best of what can result from Adele's considerable vocal talent.<br /><br />Stark piano ballads \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" anchor the album. Their lyrical content, brooding melodies and sincere vocals quietly underscore that her talent has accrued interest in the years between records.<br /><br />Adele seems destined to craft better records in the future, but \\"21\\" is a step in the right direction.in the years between records.    Adele seems destined to craft better records in the future, but \\"21\\" is a step in the right direction.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|This album is awesome. Demi's voice is so wonderful. I listen to every song over and over. Get Back is my favorite Demi Lovato song, but Trainwreck and Party are also great songs. The feeling and the notes she performs with that amazing powerful voice, just floor me. The title song and LaLa Land are also super
B004CRR9G0|3.0|This is actually a 1080P Blu-disk for sure, the film has been re-mastered and the same master is gonna be on the US release and thats all fine and good~ If you wanted to see this film in HD this is what you want, no complaints about the video accept its alittle unstable but thats film for ya, nothing you could do, the transfer could not really be better. Just wanted to be honest in my review this film was a favorite of mine and watching it in HD kinda ruined it for me. On the ugly DVD or VHS transfers is easy to miss the fact that this was a super sloppy production, watch it on a 1080p Projector and ohhh-boy~ you'll know. There are missing cells, miss-colored cells, really harsh analog music editing, i mean it's really a mess of a production and watching it at its best really ruined the magic for me, just saying. For some it might be part of the charm, but being a child hood favorite of mine, it was just too harsh.
B000002BSG|1.0|Thank you, seller, for this product. I have loved this cd for so long and it is no longer in print and you cannot find it in stores. I was psyched when I found it on Amazon (they have everything by the way). I received the cd in excellent condition and also before I could even forget that I ordered it.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|We have a HDTV and HDMI cable and along with this blu ray disc the picture looks absolutely stunning. My husband was raving about the picture. The movie was fantastic. I had never viewed it before. Very good and suspenseful.
B00000DR5D|4.0|Somebody PLEASE tell me how you're supposed to appreciate an album like Ricochet?  An album where the *same exact few guitar and keyboard notes* repeat a million times in a row.  It's enough to make ANY sane man completely lose his mind.  It *sounds* nice sure, but anybody can make a musical instrument sound good with enough practice to keep in tune.<br /><br />The trick is to actually make notes that are *good* and at least somewhat complex.  Or in this particular case, at least make a series of notes that creates an atmosphere that actually enhances the experience since, you know, Tangerine Dream is SUPPOSED to be the masters of adventurous atmosphere and ambient sounds.  The repetitive guitar riff that dominates most of side one strongly borders on mindlessly simplistic.<br /><br />I'm not necessarily saying I can personally re-create these same notes because I've never picked up a guitar in my life, but you gotta admit, this is some pretty boring stuff.  Good sleeping music and nothing more.  Tangerine Dream used to be significantly more exciting on albums like Phaedra, Rubycon and Stratosfear.  Even Zeit destroys this.<br /><br />Sometimes Tangerine Dream has its share of overlong and tiresome moments, but usually they're capable of bouncing back and providing at least *something* interesting.  On Ricochet however?  It's like the band was asking themselves \\"Should we make actual music, or ambient stuff that will accomplish absolutely nothing and go absolutely nowhere?\\" and ended up stuck somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />Maybe I'll change my mind one day which will surely prompt me to come back to amazon and change my rating and review.  I *do* change my ratings and reviews from time to time, especially when it concerns albums I believe I'm not ready to experience.  This qualifies as one of those albums.  We'll see...<br /><br />Perhaps Tangerine Dream just can't produce the same effective kind of ambience in a live setting?  It has to be that because what I've heard from their album Encore stinks just as much.<br /><br />Update August 9, 2011-<br /><br />Alright, perhaps I was being unfair with \\"Ricochet Part Two\\".  I actually like this 20-minute track and especially the exceptionally dreamy way the piece slowly builds using electronic drum beats, guitar solos, flutes and keyboards.  I still can't get into \\"Ricochet Part One\\" however.  To me, it STILL sounds like one ordinary guitar riff repeating endlessly with no regard for atmosphere or interesting build-up of any sorts.  Oh well, who knows, maybe it'll grow on me one day regardless of my current feelings.<br /><br />Another update February 1, 2014-<br /><br />Alright, listening to Ricochet again right now, I can finally officially say that NOW I'm able to appreciate this album!  So a 4-star rating is more deserving.  I'm glad!  I feel relieved actually.  It's been bugging me for a while why I couldn't get into an album many consider a classic, or at least deserving of a purchase given how it's a legendary bands first live performance.  Well now I've done it.  \\"Ricochet Part One\\" does repeat the same one or two guitar lines over and over on a couple different occasions but I suppose absorbing the atmosphere and focusing on the dream state instead of focusing so hard on the music itself (which is how I normally listen to music) is the better approach.  And shame on me for saying ANYTHING on Encore stinks.  That album is now a classic to me.  :)
B003BWERF8|5.0|I was quite surprised to find out that my Motorola Ipod Bluetooth Adapter and S-9 headset would not work with my new 6th gen. Ipod Nano (Thanks Apple!) after using it on my 2nd gen. Nano for several years.  After reading several reviews on the Kokkia adapter I ordered one and, as usual, Amazon had it to me a day before promised.  I plugged it into my Nano and it instantly connected to my S-9 headset without even having to pair it!  Another nice feature is that it allows the headset controls to operate the Nano.     One great thing I noticed was that the Kokkia adapter does not lose its connection even when I am jogging.  My Motorola adapter was always dropping the connection and then had trouble pairing up again.  The small size of the Kokkia adapter makes it a great match for the new style Ipod Nano.  This product is the real deal!    Pros: Small size, Effortless Bluetooth pairing, Great connection, Ability to use controls on headset and not have to fumble with Ipod    Cons: Small size (after the massive size of the Motorola adapter I am afraid I will lose this adapter and have to use corded earphones until I can order another one!)
B002C2XXJY|5.0|I just love the album. Demi Lovato has an amazing voice. She sings with a lot of feeling. My favorite song is, \\"Falling Over Me.\\"
B004G600A4|5.0|About 55 years ago when I first saw Disney's Snow White in the theater I was completely blown away.  I don't really remember being so awed by a cartoon until many years later when I saw Beauty and the Beast.  Lion King, of course, is in a class by itself.  Now I must add Tangled to the list of great Disney animation.  I never expected to see an animated film this well done again in my lifetime.  The characters are exceptional.  Rapunzel is an absolute delight.  I cannot imagine how Rapunzel could be improved.  The villain, Mother Gothel, is a complex, chilling character, again nearly perfect.  The music is divine.  The songs and dance (this is a musical) are wonderfully Broadway-like.  Except for the fancy new animation technology, this film could have been made, as is, in any Disney era, all the way back to the time of Snow White.  That is great praise indeed. I often complain that they don't make'em like they use to.  I have no complaints with Tangled.  If you are older, do yourself a favor and buy this movie.  If you have any heart and soul at all, you will have a wonderful time watching it.
B000002OX7|4.0|\\"Baba O'Riley.\\" \\"Bargain.\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes.\\" \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\" Those were the popular attractions and lurings this album exhibited. The Who's \\"Who's Next\\" seems to be a mandatory have in your album collection, for those who like classic rock, even though I don't like knowing that an album went very mainstream and thus considered excellent, perhaps like this one. Nothing really wrong with the aforementioned hits. The only problem with this album is either the ephemeral lyrics (Baby Don't You Do It and I Don't Even Know Myself) and impatient melodies (Pure and Easy, Getting In Tune & Naked Eye); by impatient melodies, I mean tracks that start out too slow and take a while to progress. Two versions of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" was wasteful. Other hidden gems include \\"Going Mobile\\" and the previously unreleased \\"TOo Much of Anything.\\" At times, the drum performances are thrilling and entertaining.
0756405890|4.0|\\"The Name of the Wind\\" is the debut fantasy novel by Patrick Rothfuss.  It details the story of a Kvothe, a teenage boy orphaned from his travelling troupe of performers called the \\"Edema Ruh.\\"  Now homeless, impoverished and living on the harsh streets of the port city of Tarbean, Kvothe fights daily for survival and to maintain his sanity.  Although barely surviving day to day, Kvothe is a child prodigy and dreams of one day attending the University where sciences and magic (called \\"Sympathy\\") are taught.  In addition seeks answers regarding the loss of his parents and is seeking a general purpose in life.  Here are my thoughts on this thought provoking fantasy tale;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Extremely well written and edited. The author has a degree in Creative Writing and it clearly shows.<br /><br />+ Moving passages about love and loss, especially regarding music and its extreme importance to Kvothe.  The passage of Kvothe playing his first time at the Eolian is exceptionally moving.<br /><br />+ Plentiful amount of interesting and well described characters.  The University Masters are extremely easy to picture, each with their own unique personality.  Manet (an older University friend of Kvothe's) is another character the author describes well.  Master Elodin quickly became one of my favorite characters as did Auri and Devi (both former University students).<br /><br />+ Kvothe's hardships in the city of Tarbean translate very well on paper.  It was easy to feel the ups and downs of his character during that turbulent period.<br /><br />+ Author continuously conveys the importance of Kvothe's upbringing and parents.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Kvothe's constant cocksure attitude and inflated ego often made him an unappealing main character.  He may be a child prodigy but he's also an arrogant a$$ most of the time.  When unfortunate things did occur in his life I found it difficult to feel sorry for him.<br /><br />- Certain characters aren't as well fleshed out as others and remain largely faceless.  Kvothe's closest classmates, Wil and Sim were perfect examples of this.  Every time I tried to picture these characters in my head, I couldn't.<br /><br />- Incomplete and undetailed world map.  Through the majority of the book I kept referencing the map to get a better understanding where the places being mentioned were.  Unfortunately, the majority of the time they weren't listed anywhere, rendering the map largely useless.<br /><br />- Little to no action.<br /><br />- Borrows ideas from other books and history.<br /><br />- Ending was a bit bland.<br /><br />- Narrative often slows to a crawl.<br /><br />- Back teaser is a bit of bait and switch as most of the things listed never happen in the book as it's only the beginning of Kvothe's journeys.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is considered by many to be a great first novel, myself included.  I would strongly classify it as a character driven fantasy and not the traditional Lord of the Rings style epic adventure.  If you're strictly the epic style fantasy reader than you'll probably want to steer clear of this title.  While I wouldn't consider the best fantasy (I prefer sword and sorcery/high fantasy) book I've ever read, it kept me thoroughly interested despite its flaws.  Rothfuss has created a cast of memorable characters that many readers will identify with.  Oddly I found myself liking most of the other characters more than Kvothe.  To me, that's a bit problematic.  I also found some of the ideas a bit too borrowed.  It's very easy to compare the University aspects of book to titles like Harry Potter etc...  Other direct parallels could include the fabled Amyr to the Knights Templar.  Despite my overall gripes with the book I still found it thoroughly enjoyable and an impressive first novel.  Rothfuss is an extremely talented writer and it clearly shows in the Name of the Wind.  If you enjoy character driven fantasy then this book is definitely worth a read.<br /><br />p.s. my apologies to Amazon friend RNicholson for liking this book.  Hopefully your opinion of my reading preferences won't be tarnished. ;)ces won't be tarnished. ;)
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I love the fact that Josh is constantly branching out.  I have to say that I find this album more soulful and meaningful than the others.  I had just bought the CD and was on a 4 hour drive so I turned it on and was instantly curious.  I was used to the style he has delivered in all of his other albums but this was different, more soulful and meaningful. When I reached track 11 I started to cry (not good when driving)as my son had just returned from bootcamp! What an amazing and beautiful song, The War At Home is a wonderful dedication to all those men and women and their families who serve here and abroad, not only the military but the police and fire fighters.      The rest of the album is a sign that Josh is growing as a artist and trying new songs and differnt avenues of delivery.  It's funny to me that people have been so critical of this album, when a artist wants to branch out and try something different it should be encouraged because there may be something more wonderful to come.  Josh is an amazing talent and should be able to try different types/styles of songs, I believe his true fans will really like this album.
031603438X|5.0|I received this book in perfect condition.  It was larger than I expected:) It caught my interest right away, from page one.  I loved his candor about his life and all the experiences he had.  Being a child of the 70's myself, I could relate to a lot of things he wrote about especially the culture at that time.  It was really interesting reading about his childhood and how his love for music developed.  Personally, I am not a 'stones' fan, but I am now a 'Keith' fan:))
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I really loved this book. I initially did not plan on reading it so soon, but I received it as a present and was between books so decided to give it a try and I am very glad I did. I thought that the plot was interesting and the book was very well written. My favorite aspect of the book was the characters and the character development. The main character Diana was easy to like and I immediately connected with her and wanted to read more about her life. Matthew was also an excellent character and it was interesting reading about the relationship between him and Diana. Their relationship was another positive thing about the book. It did not feel rushed and you could see and understand how their relationship was building and why they felt the way they did. The secondary characters were also well written and interesting and made me want to learn more about them as well. All of the characters, including the secondary characters were multi-faceted and had a lot of depth to them. What you initially saw was just a sliver of what the character was really like. This was definitely a book I could not put down, I just wanted to read and learn more about these characters lives. I am excited that there will be a sequel and cannot wait for it to come out. I urge everyone to give this book a try.
1595141715|3.0|My Literature for Young Adults class read this book and I have to say this was not my favorite. I admit it is generally a good book but you have to try and not think about it. Hannah does not actually seem suicidal until later in the tapes and even then the circumstances leading to her suicide could have been stopped. It seems like every major episode that lead to her suicide was something that she let happen to give her an excuse to do this. I'm not too far out of high school myself and if I let things slip away from me as a result of a stupid rumor I would have died thousands of times. I just cannot say that Hannah was remotely convincing.
B004ENQNYG|5.0|Over the past years I've received many damaged LP sleeves but I was surprised when I opened the cardboard box with the two LP's I ordered packed in individual cardboard sleeves that covered the LP perfectly. Amazon.com has finally found a good way of packing their vinyl records. Thank you for that! And the music on the LP is great with good sound.
B001FB5634|1.0|Being a fan of post-apocalypic genre, I would have bought the DVD, even if I had known how bad it is. Anyway, that's $16.00 and a hour fifty one minutes, down the drain. Too many screenplay, story line glitches, and nonsensical scene scenarios. The basic story line about the man's relationship with his son was intact. But, the rest of the film was \\"out of sync\\" with reality, given the conditions portrayed in the film. (Now, tell me you didn't think, the black guy would appear at the end.)I'm sure Guy Pierce and Robert Duvall got paid, for their five minutes each in the film.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|I've got 2 words for everyone that's saying 'Machete' is a horrible mess...you're right. It's an epic failure, but what else do you expect from Robert Rodriguez? He realizes his shortcomings as a storyteller, so he compensates by filling the screen with tons of big name stars, loud explosions, over-the-top sex and violence and anything else he can think of. Obviously it's overkill and it doesn't really work, but you can't say he's not trying. With all due respect to 'Touch Of Evil' -  once considered the best B-movie ever made -  I think 'Machete' can safely wear that crown. Where else are you going to see Danny Trejo bed Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan on his way to an epic sword fight with Steven Seagal? Or Robert DeNiro, as a racist Texas senator, shooting everyone in sight? There are so many more unbelievable sights and sounds to be found here, that I strongly recommend seeing it twice. Odds are, if you're like me, you'll be less than impressed the first time around because there's simply too much stuff going on. But after the 2nd and 3rd time, you'll be having too much fun enjoying it for what it is: a gloriously trashy movie that makes you wish other filmmakers had the talent and guts to make movies like this more often.    Ex-Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) has been double-crossed and left for dead. After watching Torrez (Seagal), a Mexican druglord, brutally murder his wife and daughter, he vows revenge. Problem is he's not a cop anymore so he's forced to compete with all the other day laborers for whatever menial job he can get his  hands on. When shadowy political fixer  Boothe (Jeff Fahey) offers him $150,000 to assassinate Sen. McLaughlin (DeNiro), he thinks his luck might be turning around. It isn't. Once more Machete finds himself double-crossed and left for dead. But with the help of a sexy taco truck proprietor/revolutionary (Rodriguez) he's back on his feet in no time and more pissed than ever. He sets out to take down Torrez, Boothe and their minions one by one. Along the way he'll also have to battle an I.C.E. agent (Alba) intent on bringing him in, a flashy hitman (Tom Savini) and a hillbilly border guard (Don Johnson) waging a one man war against all Mexicans. Machete isn't going it alone though, he has his brother (Cheech Marin), now a man of the cloth, supplying him with incriminating evidence against Boothe and McLaughlin, as well as a hearse as an inconspicuous getaway vehicle. And, as if Rodriguez and Alba weren't enough, Machete also has the love of another good woman (Lohan) and her mom as well. If it sounds convoluted and pointlessly complicated, that's because it is. There's far too many characters and plot twists guaranteeing that not everything will be neatly wrapped up by the end of the film. But there are plenty of highlights along the way such as LiLo's first official nude scene (you do see something by the way), Steven Seagal's triumphant (?) return to the big screen after 7+ years in direct-to-video purgatory and Danny Trejo finally getting his time in the spotlight after appearing in nearly 150 films. So learn to take the good with the bad - and believe me there's plenty of both to go around - and enjoy this one-of-a-kind film that may just be Rodriguez's best.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The DS has a ton of amazing gems, but this has got to be the best one yet! I simply can not believe how much fun one game can be... This is simply a game you can not afford to miss.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|After reading all the great reviews, I expected something a little more exciting.  Yes, the shots were great, especially of rare birds and animals, but I found the narration to be boring.  I watched it with my mom and even she commented that David Attenborough was putting her to sleep.  Also, the music in the video was much louder than his voice, so you really had to strain to hear what he is saying.  We still enjoyed it - something relaxing yet intellectually stimulating to watch at the end of the day.
0143038583|4.0|It came super fast, so that was good. Unfortunately the book had large item stickers placed on the back cover that hung off the edge and looked very messy. The book was in decent condition but not as nice I had expected it to be.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I LOVE this movie!  I know the whole time-travel, enter-into-your-favorite-book fantasy thing has been done over and over again, but I love it anyway!
0763644765|5.0|We love this book! We have almost all of Leslie Patricelli's books and read them over and over again. The illustrations are simple but adorable, and the wrtiting leaves enough for you to add what you need to relate to your child. \\"Tinklt, tinkle toot\\" That had me laughing out loud in the book store, and my daughter laughing every time we read it. We have been working hard on the concept of wearing big kid undies and this book put the icing on the cake. Love it!!
B001QOGYBI|3.0|I wavered between three and four stars on this one. I'd give 3-1/2 if I could. Fantastic Mr. Fox is very refreshing. The stop-motion animation is charming. The voice talent, headed by George Clooney and Meryl Streep, raises the bar for animated films. There is some smart, subtle humor. Box-office figures tell me I'm the only one out there, but I'm just so, so, so sick of 3D computer-generated animation movies bogged down with slapstick/bathroom humor, flying objects and the voices of the same comedians over and over.     Unfortunately a couple of things kept me from giving this a higher ranking. I found it disconcerting that the animals had American accents and the humans had English accents. This is obviously an English countryside story so an all-English cast would have worked better for me. The narrative, about a married fox who can't resist returning to crime after years of a respectable career as a journalist, was OK, but I didn't find myself profoundly concerned. Put it this way: If the DVD hadn't played properly, I wouldn't have stomped up to the video store and demanded another disc so I could see the ending.    Though animated, I wouldn't call \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" a children's movie. The morality is too ambiguous and the humor too adult. I don't mean that it's particularly obscene or vulgar or morally reprehensible; it's not. It's just that most kids aren't going to appreciate this film. When I told my kid that we'd rented it, he said to watch it after he went to bed because he'd already seen it and hated it.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This processor flies for $200! So far I have overclocked to 3.5 Ghz and 4Ghz Turbo ( 3 cores loaded only ) with stock fan and heatsink ( it comes with it's own copper tube/fin cooler and fan which i am using. ) just bumping the multipliers up. I have not had to up the voltage at these clock speeds. I have had no stability issues either. With a OCZ SSD, Windows 7 boots in roughly 15 seconds and is ready to use rather than having to wait for the HDD to settle down. CPU temperatures under 100% load have stayed below 40 degrees Celsius. I have read that overclocking to 4Ghz on all cores ( turbo off ) does significantly increase power usage to around 260 watts, so be sure and have a good power supply if you plan to push it hard. I do know the powerhouse i7 processor can easily beat the Phenom II X6, but for the price difference it should.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|Since I consider myself an educated, civilized being, I was strongly tempted to give this series only two stars because of the unimaginative - and mostly unnecessary - profanity its characters constantly excrete and because of the equally unimaginative gladiator training and fighting sequences (which take up time that would have been better spent telling us more about the characters, especially the gladiators: where do they all come from and how did they end up as slaves in Batiatus' ludus?), accompanied by a metal-laden soundtrack, which seems to be inevitable in historic action flicks these days.<br /><br />A brief Web search showed that not much is known about Spartacus, but it appears that the series' producers took care to incorporate actual historical figures, such as Glaber, Batiatius, Crixus and Oenomaus, to name a few. It also made an attempt to get the scenery and costumes halfway right (although many of the women's dresses seemed straight from the pages of a fantasy magazine - but I'm no expert on Roman fashion).<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with the abundant sex scenes (with the exception of those in which the actors looked decidedly uncomfortable, like Braca's [cringe-worthy!] kissing scenes). Rather than trying to shock viewers or point out the lewdness and lasciviousness of the Romans, they simply seemed to state the fact that people who live in a world of many uncertainties, where human lives count little and are constantly lost to hunger, disease, crime, and other dangers, enjoy whatever distractions and pleasures they can have, whenever and wherever they can get them.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed Lucy Lawless' Lucretia (although I found the chemistry between her and John Hannah non-existent - the man seemed mostly full of himself and preoccupied with the c- and f-words), Viva Bianca's Ilithyia (although I couldn't help thinking \\"Haldir! You are most welcome!\\" every time her husband Glaber appeared on screen), and Jaime Murray's Gaia in \\"Gods of the Arena\\". The actors portraying the gladiators do passable jobs, even though their roles consist mostly of strutting about, looking buff. At that they all excel, and I forgive them their sometimes wooden dialogue performances because they are such eye candy.<br /><br />Having never watched \\"Rome\\", this series was new and different to me, and thanks to \\"Gods of the Arena\\", I now also know what a gomph stick is. Overall, I felt well entertained - although the next time I'm in the mood for a good, earnest fight scene, I'll rather dig out a Bruce Lee movie. :)he Arena\\".

B002LVVCQM|5.0|I opt to sidestep the large-type debate in my review, apart to say I'm with science.  I've enjoyed completely a few other Dawkins books, this is my first on Kindle.<br /><br />This book has many fascinating facts and points; if you like learning about and understanding things, this book is for you.  If you don't happen to have a buddy who is super smart with all things biology and science who is willing, able, and enthusiastic to patiently and effectively explain the universe to you in simple terms... buy this book, and then you will.  Part of the universe, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously, the book is about evolution.  The material fits between or around material from the author's other books, so minimal repeat info.  A further extension/development of Dawkins-mind; no surprise there.

B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderful book, remarkable story. Very much enjoyed this book. I thought the author did an excellent job of painting the scenes in each time period and introducing and developing the people in the stories. She also made the complex topic of cell culturing fairly easy to understand - which I very much appreciated! I laughed, I cried, I got angry and I felt true sympathy for the Lacks family.    I also enjoyed visiting the author's website and looking at a few more photos. I would recommend doing that after you finish the book (esp. if you have the Kindle version) as some of the pics might give away a bit of the story.    A truly fantastic read. Highly recommend!
1935251740|1.0|Just another form of the strong anthropic principle, virtually identical in its basic justification to Barrow and Tipler's version, which is a variant on John Archibald Wheeler's Participatory Anthropic Principle... right down to the citing of quantum theory as justification for its ramblings.<br /><br />I'd almost consider it plagarism, given that the authors have claimed the idea for themselves.

0385732554|5.0|According to the back cover, The Giver is a Boston-Globe-Horn Book Honor Book, an American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults, an American Library Association Notable Book for Children, a winner of the Regina Medal, a Booklist Editors Choice, a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and it won the John Newbery Award. With all of that, do you really need me to tell you that The Giver is a really good book? Probably not, but I'm going to anyway. The Giver is a really good book and one of my all time favorites. If you haven't read it, stop what you're doing and read it now.<br /><br />The focus of The Giver is the people living in The Community, a perfect society. There are echoes of Brave New World and 1984, but The Giver is only a dystopian novel depending on how you look at it. The Community is a utopia. It's perhaps a little rough around the edges, true, but it's a mostly perfect place and it has to be, or the main thesis of the novel would fall short. I'm getting a bit ahead of myself, but just remember that for this book to work, life in The Community has to be a life worth considering or there is no dilemma for our characters or the reader.<br /><br />Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can. No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man. Imagine all the people sharing all the world... You may say Lois Lowry is a dreamer, but this is the world of The Community. There is almost no pain, no sickness, no poverty, no religion, no racism, no one is left wanting for anything (and what they might want, they've never known), and almost no one is ever lonely. I know what you're thinking, Esteemed reader: What's the catch? Well there is one and we'll get to it, but first consider life in The Community.<br /><br />The people of The Community are healthy because for the first year of their life they are in the care of nurturers, who ensure every baby is the perfect weight and well taken care of by experienced professionals. There are no unwanted children in The Community and that right there is something to consider. Every child growing up in The Community is given everything they'll ever need and cared for all the way into their old age.<br /><br />True, the members of The Community do have to give up some things, but that's not all bad either. At twelve years of age, a committee decides a person's occupation and they go into training and there they'll work for the rest of their lives, so job stability is never an issue. If a person requests one, a mate will be assigned to them. A mate carefully chosen by committee to ensure they are a perfect match for their spouse and later the couple can apply for two children, a girl and a boy. When the children have grown, they'll live with their friends, Mom and Dad will live with their friends, and no one is lonely or rejected.<br /><br />Again, I know what you're thinking: how could anyone live with all of their decisions made by others and no freedom? Well, if I may play devil's advocate, I might ask \\"what's so great about freedom?\\" And temporarily suspend your patriotic programming as an American and really consider it. I'm fortunate that God put the perfect woman on earth just for me and I found her and married her, but Lord knows I found a few who weren't her beforehand. There were others I could have married that might just have wrecked my life and made wretched my destiny. There was no committee to help me out and I might just have made the wrong choice. Anybody reading ever know anyone who made the wrong choice in a mate?<br /><br />And what about career choice? Sure, I've found the perfect job for me and I couldn't be happier now, but I spent a lot of years in wrong jobs I chose. And what about the folks we all know who just plain make the wrong choices all around? Their wrong choices don't affect just them, we all suffer. A person making the choice to lose themselves in drugs or other indulgences may claim it's only themselves they are hurting, but this is alie as transparent as Charlie Sheen's recent claim that he is only going to smoke crack socially (a funnier line than anything on his show).<br /><br />My favorite thing about The Community is how they treat their old. When folks in The Community get old, they are moved to The House for the Old where they are cared for like the children. They never experience dementia or other horrifying sickness. No one is kept in a hospital bed for years suffering alone. When it's time, the old person is surrounded by their friends and their life is celebrated. They tell the story of the person's life and then he or she says one last goodbye and is \\"released into Elseworld.\\" Is that a euphemism that means what you think it means? There are no spoilers on this blog, but even if it does mean that, is that really so bad? I can think of much worse ways to go.<br /><br />So what's the catch, already? I know it's our anniversary and all, but this review is running a little long. The catch is that The Community has no memory, no passion, and no sense of its past. They have no hate, but they also have no love. There's a wonderful freedom in this as well, but is it worth it? I'm not going to tell you and one of my most favorite things about The Giver is that Lois Lowry doesn't tell you either. The best books provoke the reader's imagination and leave readers to ponder these questions for themselves and draw their own conclusions. Lowry implies some things, perhaps, but for the most part she is simply asking the question.<br /><br />Nor is there a lot of explanation about the scientific workings that make The Community possible. Lowry wrote two sequels and I recommend them both and you can check them out if you want more details, but the details are sort of beside the point. There probably isn't a one hundred percent plausible explanation for everything, but so what? Lowry wisely leaves much of these details to the imagination. For example, genetic engineering is never mentioned, but it's certainly implied. And whether The Community is achieved through science, recovered UFO technology, or the wave of a wand, it makes little difference and a lesser writer going on and on about the explanation would be a waste of our time. We know The Community isn't possible, but Lowry need only provide a few details to provoke us to consider the implications of such a world if it were possible. And The Community is very real for the characters in this story, which is was ultimately matters.<br /><br />Instead, Lowry focuses on the story. When our hero, Jonas, turns twelve he is selected for the most unusual occupation of Receiver. Only one is picked every so many generations and no one really knows what he or she does, only that they need the Receiver and that it is the most important position in The Community. As Receiver, Jonas is separated from the rest of The Community. He is allowed to lie, something no one else is allowed to do, although how can he really know? He is also allowed to ask anyone anything and he is the only person who will know all that there is to know about The Community.<br /><br />Jonas is sent to the old Receiver, who becomes The Giver, and what he's giving are memories. I've said that The Community has no memory or sense of past. This is because the Receiver holds the memories for them in his head and when he grows old he transmits them to the new Receiver. The Giver transmits memories such as snow and sunburn to Jonas, which he has never experienced living in the climate controlled world of The Community. The Giver also transmits memories of war, poverty, suffering, disease, and all the rest of it to Jonas. But also colors and love, neither of which the people of The Community have ever known because they're colorblind (literally).<br /><br />In order to achieve Utopia, these people have given up everything that might create passion in their lives, even music and, gasp, choke, books. What the heck would I blog about in such a world? This is the most weighty of concerns, I know:) I wondered if the people of The Community ever engaged in, ahem, adult relationships. As this is a book for younger readers, I didn't think Lowry would cover it, but she does. After Jonas has an inappropriate dream about his sister and a bath (not his biological sister), his mother tells him he must take a pill each day to remove such \\"stirrings\\".<br /><br />I guess I sort of read over that part as a kid and didn't catch it until now. But in our world we have Viagra, and in Lowry's world there are pills that do the exact opposite. I won't spend a lot of time on this, but I would imagine you adult readers enjoy the capacity to have such relationships. On the other hand, that same capacity has brought about plenty of suffering, so I ask again: Is The Community really that bad?<br /><br />True, there is no color, no music, no art, no... um, kissing, no passion of any kind, and no books. We who love books might balk at the prospect, but that's because we know about them. The people in The Community have never had these things and don't know what they're missing. Most of them don't even know about death, and just think how much stress would be relieved if you didn't know you were going to die one day (spoiler, I know).<br /><br />But now Jonas does know and the question is what's he going to do now that he knows? Could it be that something traumatic has happened to The Giver that will make this giving and receiving of memories different than any such giving and receiving that has come in generations past? Of course it could, or this novel will be episodic and there would be no story worth telling that makes this time in The Community's history more notable than any of the others Lowry could have chosen. But I have promised no spoilers and even though a few probably slipped through, here we'll leave it.<br /><br />I haven't touched much on craft and I'm afraid I'm not going to this week. Lowry does everything right from start to finish. Like a work of Mozart, the misplacing of a single note could mean diminishment, but Lowry absolutely nails every aspect of craft and delivers what may just be a perfect book. Her prose is clear and crisp and never a distraction. In fact, I was so completely drawn into the story upon reading this book, I forgot to take that many notes even though I already knew the ending. The Giver sucks its reader in and I read the whole thing in a single sitting because it became physically impossible for me to put the book down.<br /><br />Fair warning: there are some extremely disturbing scenes in the later part of the book that would make Stephen King say, \\"Dude, that's messed up!\\" I'm not going to spoil them either. Still, sensitive readers should be aware that you may be most unpleasantly shocked. But remember, it's good to be shocked every so often.<br /><br />Be sure to be here on Thursday when none other than Lois Lowry will be here to face the 7 Questions and check back on Saturday as God willing, we'll have a literary agent here on Saturday as well. By the way, I mentioned God several times in this review, but I also listed \\"no religion\\" as a quality of utopia. That is sort of perplexing, isn't it? I never do quite reveal my full thoughts on religion or even most political issues do I? Thanks for a great year of giving and receiving on this blog everybody:)<br /><br />And now, because I see I have not included a single passage from the text in this entire longwinded review, I'll leave you with some of my favorite bits from The Giver:<br /><br />It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened. (a great opening line if I ever read one--MGN)<br /><br />But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear.<br /><br />\\"There's administrative work, and the dietary rules, and punishment for disobedience--did you know that they use a discipline wand on the Old, the same as for small children?\\"<br /><br />\\"Definitely not safe,\\" Jonas said with certainty. \\"What if they were allowed to choose their own mate? And chose wrong?<br />\\"Or what if,\\" he went on, almost laughing at the absurdity, \\"they chose their own jobs?<br />\\"Frightening, isn't it?\\" The Giver said.<br />Jonas chuckled. \\"Very frightening. I can't even imagine it. We really have to protect people from wrong choices.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning,\\" Father had said, in his sweet, sing-song voice. (really only effective if read in context, but if you've read the book, you know the impact of this line -MGN)<br /><br />After countless tries, the net yielded two flopping silvery fish.

0316066524|1.0|I'll be honest. I rather enjoy the vast majority of DFW's work. And I am sad to see him go the way he did. But, more to the point, this book is an embarrassment to American literature. While I seek out and enjoy books set in Tucson with great regularity (except for Barbara Kingsolver, whose Tucson books are utter tripe), this one paints the city in a way that is completely and utterly foreign. But that's actually not my gripe. My true complaint is that for all his talent, DFW takes a clever idea and absolutely drives it into the ground. This book could have been--and should have been--half the length that it was. I understand the overwhelming need for writers to construct a massive tome at some point in their careers. It feels good. It weighs a lot. You win genius grants from the MacArthur Foundation. Fun times. However, to say that DFW's clever little footnote trick gets old, tiresome, and flat out maddening (and I know, it's very \\"of the times\\" to multitask and show the varying levels and degrees of meaning in the human condition, but good lord) is a terrible understatement. However, in light of the ire I am sure to draw for trashing one of the quintessential practitioners of the \\"clever, self-absorbed, pretentious, and self-important\\" writing school that gave us the likes of Jonathan Franzen, Adam Levin, Arthur Bradford, Dave Eggers and the entire McSweeney's aesthetic, I will preface my final critique of the book by saying that I'm well aware of the draw of this sort of writing for would-be writers who long to go down through the ages as a hip genius of American letters. This book, in short, is a tiring exercise in cleverness--the footnotes, the hyper-extension of the foibles of commercialism and capitalism. And when you finish it and come to the realization that the joke is on you, it will sting a little, and you will be bitter. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself (I am, after all, only one of a few dissenters). And--if you ever actually finish--get back with me and tell me what you thought. I suspect that you too will find the cleverness of the book and the excessive footnotes and footnotes within footnotes, and footnotes within footnotes' footnotes to be a bit much after a while.<br /><br />P.S. for good Tucson books, look up Leslie Marmon Silko's [[ASIN:0140173196 Almanac of the Dead]], Luis Alberto Urrea's [[ASIN:0316010804 The Devil's Highway: A True Story]], Aaron Michael Morales's [[ASIN:1566892406 Drowning Tucson]], and Mario Suarez's[[ASIN:0816524041 Chicano Sketches: Short Stories by Mario Su&aacute;rez]].back with me and tell me what you thought.

B003OF3R0S|1.0|Kind of depressing. I love City of Evil, and all the releases before it. Self titled is decent. Nightmare a real let down. There are so many songs that remind me too much of \\"80's rock ballads\\", which I love, but not from A7X. It's almost as if Bon Jovi wrote like 4 of the songs on this album for them. Most songs sound the same. I really was just interested to hear Mike Portnoy's playing with them. He did a great job (no surprise). Writing severely lacks on this album. Any of the \\"heavier\\" riffs sound like they were from a has-been band playing in a bar on a Wednesday. I really wanted to like it, but it's super cheesy sounding. Of course, everyone has their own opinion.

I think it will also be very beneficial in learning to work with each others' strengths. However, I really don't like that they only give you your top 5. There are 34 strengths. We all agreed that it would be better to maybe get your top and bottom 5s, and/or possibly your ranking that you've got on each strength. Overall though, definitely worth the money.
B000A7DVR2|2.0|I had seen a short clip of the movie on a show devoted to Jeff Bridges and it looked like it would be a fun type film to see.  However, I was disappointed.  I'm not a prude, but the F word was used much too often and I felt it distracted from the story.  I think that John Goodman did an excellent job in portraying a Viet Nam vet who cannot get Nam out of his mind.  It permeates every situation he is involved in.  Applauds to John G.!!!!
0439023521|5.0|\\"They're already taking my future! They can't have the things that mattered to me in the past!\\"<br />Katniss Everdeen lives in a dystopic future where North America is now called Panem, the continent is divided into one Capitol, \\"ruling district\\", and twelve other subservient districts.  Katniss and her family mostly ekes out a living in District 12, sometimes barely surviving.  But when Katniss' beloved younger sister is called out for the Hunger Games, a yearly event where a boy and a girl from each district participate in a fight-to-the-death match, Katniss takes her sister's place.  Will Katniss survive?<br /><br />I Liked:<br />If I had to write the perfect book, it would probably contain these elements: a strong-willed, independent girl, some sort of journey or adventure or chase away from \\"bad guys\\", a big \\"life or death\\" battle, and a very laid-back romance with a realistic boy (Edward Cullen need not apply).<br />Well, whaddya know, this book exists and it's name is \\"The Hunger Games\\"!<br />Katniss Everdeen is definitely the \\"strong-willed, independent girl\\" I like to read about.  She's smart, she's quick-thinking, she's resourceful, but she still has faults.  Her communications skills are a bit lacking.  She's brusque.  She can't lie.  She can't charm people.  She doesn't have a D-cup with a Perfect Size 6.<br />Probably my favorite type of story is a journey or \\"chase\\" story.  I love stories where a character has to run away from some bad guy, to survive by her wits and sheer dumb luck.  What Katniss has to endure is precisely that: she must survive the Hunger Games, which means running away from the other 23 tributes that are trying to kill her, trying to hunt the tributes and kill them first, and to feed and provide water and protection for herself.  Not to mention, the big \\"life or death\\" battle she must face and try to survive, which I won't detail any more for fear of divulging the hideous spoilers.<br />And then romance.  Honestly, what girl doesn't want to see a little bit of romance in a book, particularly when it is well done and not the horrible Romantic Triangle or Romantic Stalker that seems so popular nowadays.  For fear of giving away too much, I loved how we were never sure if Peeta really was in love with Katniss or if it was his big ploy to get sponsors.  Plus, Peeta is definitely a charming romantic lead: if he is in love with Katniss, how sweet and romantic!  How he looks out for her and puts her ahead of him!  And yet, he doesn't exhibit crazy stalker behavior and can still argue and chide her like a real human being.<br />And while I didn't include this in my Top Factors for the Best Story ever, I do love stories that make a statement about today's culture.  I couldn't help relating the Hunger Games to the billion of stupid reality TV shows on today.  I also thought the way the districts were grouped were very similar to how distant our country has grown.  And the vapid Capitol culture hardly felt like future dystopia to me at all...I swear to God, I see this sort of insipid behavior every day.<br /><br />I Didn't Like:<br />I found very little to dislike about this book.  In fact, about the only thing that bugged me was the concept of the Hunger Games itself.  I found it a little difficult to believe that this event could possibly keep the twelve districts from revolting.  Wouldn't it do the exact opposite, make the districts more likely to revolt?<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:<br />Did they swear?  If there was, it was very mild and very sparse.<br />The clothes the tributes wear to interviews and such is said to be skimpy at times.  Katniss is told to behave as if she is in love with Peeta and exchanges a few kisses with him.<br />Very violent.  There are several deaths in this book, though that shouldn't be too unexpected, given the cover blurb.  Not to mention, several characters end up with nasty burns, knife wounds, and wasp bites.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Saying this isan amazing book doesn't quite do this book justice.  This book was so good, that I went out to buy the boxed set in hardcover when I already owned The Hunger Games in paperback.  This book was so good, in effect, that I broke my OCD rule of buying in paperback, just so I could read Catching Fire and Mockingjay without waiting forever for those to come out in paperback.<br />So, do yourself a favor, go out, buy the trilogy in boxed set and make sure you have a day or two to read them, because once you get started, there is no turning back.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B004MMEIK0|3.0|Its a good story and thats why I rated it a 3, otherwise the title has nothing to do with the story.  No female is plotting to marry a millionaire vampire whatsoever and that really is terrible. It set me up to read a really good story and I did but not what I had expected.  What I got was the usual girl in trouble and vampire on a white steed coming to the rescue and I got this story for free and I still feel gypped.
0307272702|4.0|I just read an exciting new book called \\"Why we get fat and what to do about it\\" by Gary Taubes (2011 Alfred A Knopf). Exciting to me anyway because he agrees with me 100%, 67% of the time. Since I'm right 98% of the time that's pretty good. So read this book. (Even though 91.2% of statistics are just made up)  Gary Taubes is a science writer of some acclaim and has done lots of important homework on obesity. He rightly points out that a lot of cogent, mostly German, observations we need to understand obesity are not new. Some are centuries old. This book is a more accessible sequel to his \\"Good calories, bad calories.\\" (2007)  I agree with Taubes most when he says that the calories in - calories out explanation of obesity is fundamentally flawed, to put it more mildly than he does. He finesses the first law of thermodynamics, that dictates the calories-in calories-out rule, mostly by saying it's besides the point. He cites for example the statement that it doesn't explain obesity any better than saying that alcoholism is caused by overdrinking. So he mostly concedes that fat people do eat more. \\"We don't get fat because we overeat; we overeat because we're getting fat.\\" Elephants eat a lot because they're turning into elephants, not because they eat too much, to quote another example he uses. However, there is good evidence, for example in genetically obese rats, that the fat rats don't eat more than lean rats. I think he overlooks another possible problem with the energy in - energy out rule. That is, organisms can vary the efficiency with which they burn calories. He makes another good point here that we are talking about miniscule \\"imbalances\\" amounting to one bite of food a week for example, that are impossible to monitor in rats, much less in free range humans.   Taubes comes tantalizingly close to finding out that you eat less when you exercise and get \\"in shape.\\" He describes two classic experiments by Jean Mayer, an influential nutritionist way back in the1950's. Mayer did an experiment in rats wherein he found that rats that exercised ate less than rats who didn't. Then Mayer made observations on workers in West Bengal. Mayer found that the workers who had desk jobs weren't any fatter and ate just as much as the the ones who did heavy work. Taubes proceeds to say that Mayer drew the wrong conclusions from his findings. That may be so but then so does Taubes when he repeats \\"exercise increases your appetite.\\" I've said that exercise makes you eat less, not because it changes your basal metabolism,(1) although this is a little bit difficult for me to accept because it decreases your blood pressure and heart rate, (it increases your stroke volume - the amount pumped out with each heart heart beat) but because it decreases the energy cost of the exercise that got you into shape and any daily activity.(2) Taubes presumption that exercise makes you hungry comes partly from the fact that lumberjacks, to use his example - others would be Micheal Phelps and Lance Armstrong, have to eat a lot; but they exercise way more than can be reasonably expected for the rest of us and that overwhelms the savings of the rest of their day.  I also believe with Taubes that insulin makes you fat and so carbohydrates which make you secrete insulin are poison too.  He says that we've spent two and a half million years being hunters and gatherers that eat meat and vegetables and only twelve thousand years being farmers of carbohydrates. Then we got addicted to them, like beer and cigarettes. That's why we're not engineered to deal with carbohydrates. It's also true that you can do just fine eating only whale blubber. It doesn't really hurt your heart or your cholesterol as much as eating starch does, contrary to the authorities of not so long ago, especially if you lose weight eating that whale blubber. This myth has been busted most recently by Atkins and them. There is no need to beat that dead horse. We do need to keep beating the calories-in - calories-out-horse though. That one's not dead.  So Taubes answer to the question of his title is don't eat carbohydrates. I agree with a lot of what he has to say, but where do I disagree with him?   Books like this, and I have a whole self of books with titles like \\"Why we get fat and what to do about it,\\" often start out commendably by debunking the conventional wisdom, but then they all have to come up with the one simple secret that answers all your needs, that's also wrong. I'm not sure why they can't just stay with the message that this is a complicated subject and most of what you're told by so called experts, like me, doesn't work. It might be that their publishers tell them that won't sell books. Anyway in the case of Taubes the secret is just don't eat any carbohydrates. That is not a new idea, that's the Atkins diet. There are plenty of studies that show that even though you can loose at least as much weight on this diet as any other, maybe even more, in the long run, just a year or 2, you gain back the weight. It might be that no one can stay on a no-carbohydrate diet. That would be my problem if I tried, because never eating pasta or bread or fruit would be worse than death. But I think it's more than that. After all, quiting smoking might be worse than death too, but I'm always telling people to do it anyway. In the case of the no-carbohydrate diet, at least  you don't have to be hungry. According to these guys, if you get hungry you can always just eat another piece of salami. Also the answer, when we finally do get it may indeed be something simple. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the idea that there might be a simple solution. Still the evidence is that the no-carbohydrate diet doesn't work even if you stick to it.  On page 181 Taubes says that the incidence of heart disease has not diminished recently. That's not true. Also, Taubes' cavilling to the contrary not-with-standing, the best evidence shows that the order from baddest to least bad is high LDL, low HDL and high triglycerides.  In the last chapter \\"Following Through\\" Taubes does some back peddling. This might not work for everyone. Can some people get away with eating just a little carbohydrate? Are some people so addicted to carbohydrate that even one bite will lead to falling off the wagon?  Finally, Taubes' doesn't satisfactorily speak to the 5 conundrums that you have to address with any answer to the obesity problem. 1. Why did we get so fat in the last 30 years? 2. How does biology defy the 1st law of thermodynamics. 3. How does the set point in your brain get reset 4. Why does obesity surgery work so well? 5. Why are we living longer and having fewer heart attacks if we're all fatter?    1. Broeder CE, Burrhus KA, Svanevik LS and Wilmore JH. The effects of aerobic fitness on resting metabolic rate.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book was amazingly written.  LOVE the first person written from the little boy's perspective.  Genius.  But it gave me nightmares.  The way the boy thinks and the little misunderstandings he makes are so like my actual sons that it was really disturbing.  This is not for the faint of heart.  My mom asked me and I told her, it's great, but don't read it.  She can't handle it.  Intense and upsetting, but really really good reading.  Now, to read something silly and try to forget it!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele Adkins is young, but her vocal delivery commands the attention that classic soul singers do. It's a sound that can knock you out with its power and break your heart with its pain. Think of the timelessness of Etta James and Aretha Franklin.<br /><br />By performing masterful interpretations of her own songs, heartfelt meditations on desire, love, and loss, Adele gives her white British rivals a serious run for their money, from Dusty Springfield to Joss Stone. And unlike neo-soul bad girls Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen, whose public misbehavior has at times overshadowed their talent, Adele is all about the music.<br /><br />She deservedly won the 2009 Grammy for Best New Artist. On \\"21,\\" her highly anticipated second release, she continues the winning streak. Her songs span the gamut from dance numbers like \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"He Won't Go\\" to intimate string- and chorus-backed piano ballads like \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Take It All.\\" Each is beautifully written, arranged, played, and sung. My favorite is the haunting, operatic torch song, \\"Don't You Remember.\\"<br /><br />The lead single, \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" is already a radio and video sensation, and while the rest of the album doesn't quite have the irresistible force of that track, it's never less than excellent. Another personal favorite is \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" with its perfect harmonies and horn section on the chorus. It's a standout track and a candidate for Adele's next hit single. Her cover of \\"Lovessong,\\" by The Cure, gives the song a stunning transformation.<br /><br />Please check out her Tiny Desk Concert at the NPR website, in which she presents three numbers with only piano and guitar accompaniment: \\"Someone Like You\\" (the sad and lovely final track from \\"21,\\" now at the top of the British charts), \\"Chasing Pavements\\" (the hit from her first album, \\"19\\"), and \\"Rolling in the Deep.\\" If you only like Adele's sound now, I promise you'll be both blown away and hooked by the end of the 15-minute show.<br /><br />An exclusive version of this album, distributed by Target stores, came with a bonus CD containing four tracks: a concert version of \\"Need You Now\\" (featuring Darius Rucker) and live acoustic versions of \\"Someone Like You,\\" \\"Turning Tables,\\" and \\"Don't You Remember.\\" It quickly sold out, but you can find it used on Amazon. There's also a limited edition import with two bonus tracks: \\"If It Hadn't Been for Love\\" and \\"Hiding My Heart.\\"/><br />An exclusive version of this album, distributed by Target stores, came with a bonus CD containing four tracks: a concert version of \\"Need You Now\\" (featuring Darius Rucker) and live acoustic versions of \\"Someone Like You,\\" \\"Turning Tables,\\" and \\"Don't You Remember.\\" It quickly sold out, but you can find it used on Amazon.

B00000JPH6|4.0|On a planet warmed by no less than three suns--one white, one yellow, and one almost purple--live several races of intelligent beings, including the vulture-like Skekses, who for a thousand years have ruled the world, gaining immortality by solar rays focused through the Dark Crystal of the title.  Now, as a millennium ago, the three suns are poised to line up (\\"the Great Conjunction\\"), and if the Skekses are not defeated, they will gain power over the very stars.  The task of destroying them falls to Jen, a young Gelfling, one of an elfin humanoid race that the Skekses have attempted to utterly destroy.  Rescued and reared by the gentle if grotesque Mystics, he is sent forth by his dying master with instructions to find a shard that broke off the Crystal at the last Conjunction.  Though he has hardly a clue of what he's doing or how to go about it, meetings with the secret-keeper Aughra and another Gelfling--Kira, a female raised by a clan of Podlings--help him to find the shard and the way.    What's best about this movie is the wildly imaginative landscape and the creatures that inhabit it (viewers who'd like a closer look might want to acquire the bound volume [[ASIN:B001H55MBY The World of the Dark Crystal]]).  The Skekses and their Garthim soldiers (creatures that partake of the crab and the bug) particularly are a bit too grotesque for young kids, but tweens and teens should be able to handle them without undue upset.  And fans of Tolkien will recognize in Jen another of those reluctant heroes with whom high fantasy is so often populated.  The soundtrack [[ASIN:B000QEILB0 The Dark Crystal: 25th Anniversary]] is majestic and strange too.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|Hollywood is out of ideas.  Fitting then that this movie was rejected as is by all the studios and therefore had to be financed independently to avoid being meddled with.  It only saw any support after it was made and screened and studios saw the overwhelming public response.  Don't interpret that to mean that it is in any way technically lacking in production value, however.  The picture and the affects are brilliant and cutting edge.  The plot is rewarding and avoids pitfalls I was sure it was heading for while watching.  If you are easily offended, don't watch this.  If you are a big boy/big girl and appreciate irony and original uncompromising writing and directing, this is for you.  This is what all movies should strive to be like in quality and creative integrity.
B00005JMX6|5.0|The Risky Business of the 2000's, that's how I view this movie.  And it didn't disappoint.  Hirsch delivers a great performance, accurately portraying the kid who has never stepped out of bounds, and Elisha Cuthbert is scorching hot.  Every teenage boy who sees this movie is going to fall in love with her character, if not for her amazing beauty, for her fun personality and gutsy attitude.<br /><br />Basically, a nerd falls in love with the girl next door, finds out she's really a pornstar, tries to get her out of that lifestyle while she is being sucked in, and almost loses control of his own life while trying to save her.  There are a ton of great laughs and steamy scenes to go with it.  All in all, I love this movie.
142334216X|5.0|you can't read this 5 book series all at once. it's A LOT to absorb. not only that, but the author wrote it w/ the thought of the year or so wait in between books....which is non-existent now that all the books are out.     she introduces a lot of new ideas, so at first you may have some problems with the book/series. but once you understand what the author was trying to do, you'll feel MUCH better about everything.     i really have no words for this series other than I adore it.     It encompasses everything I like about a book.   It's real, gives your mind things to chew on, it's deep, yet escape worthy and though it gets dark it's a happy ending :D    It's everything and more!
B003Y5H55Q|4.0|As of writing, this film isn't out in Canada, however a CAM version of the UK release is out, so I am reviewing it based on the version I saw.<br /><br />When it comes to Brit comedy, nobody does it quite like the Frost/Pegg duo. Both are phenomenal actors and seeing them on screen is a charm. So when I saw the trailer for \\"Paul\\" with The Green Hornet,, I must say I was very excited. And I must say, the film didn't disappoint. Is it quite on the same level as the Blood and Ice Cream movies? Definitely not, but it's a great piece of brain popcorn and I believe you will definitely love it.<br /><br />This movie is basically the plot of E.T. with the humour of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, and it works! Of course you can't go wrong with that combination. Although Edgar Wright didn't direct the film, and the film feels very different from the mentioned two, this film actually manages to have the same level of charm and entertainment as those two. Also, the film has a wide range of good actors- including Jason Bateman, Jane Lynch, and even David Koechner!<br /><br />Two British nerds, Graeme and Clive, are on a road trip across the US, which they have been dreaming of as kids. They've been dreaming of this as kids, and the highlight so far has been Comic Con San Diego. They<br />even have met Adam Shadowchild. One night, while in Area 51, Nevada, they witness a car crash, and come across the foul-mouthed alien slacker Paul. But this ain't no District 9 or E.T. Paul is, as mentioned above, is a slacker, and a loud/foul mouth. He is being chased by US government agents, and Graeme and Clive have no choice but<br />to take them with him. Along the way, they pick up a religious chick, an old lady who was wronged by Paul, and it all becomes one wacky and zany adventure.<br /><br />This is definitely an adults-only version of E.T., and one that manages to entertain all the way through. Tonnes of gross moments and WTF moments as well as belly laughs and crude humour. Seth Rogen is<br />surprisingly great as the said alien Paul, his voice is surprisingly fitting. He was great in his past year's The Green Hornet, and he does amazingly well here. Pegg and Frost are their usual charming selves,<br />and manage to make a great team. But the highlight of the movie was Kristen Wiig- she was HILARIOUS!!!! Every line from her mouth was gold, and she definitely stole the show. This movie also had lots of heart too, and there is a VERY touching scene near the end I will not spoil.<br /><br />Overall, this definitely is not Wright material, but if you go into it with an open mind, you will enjoy this movie like I did. Definitely recommended for sure.lien Paul, his voice is surprisingly fitting. He was great in his past year's The Green Hornet, and he does amazingly well here.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was instantly one of my favorite movies once it hit theaters, and watching it on Blu-ray really has a similar effect to the silver screen.  The picture is very true, and the sound is superb.  The acting for this action movie is excellent, and Heath Ledger's last major performance was certainly among his best.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, or don't know what it's about, you simply have to watch this movie.  The twisted nature of the Joker is disturbing, but also somewhat intriguing at the same time.  I came away from this movie with so many answers, but just as many questions.  The saddest thing about this movie is that Heath Ledger will not be able to reclaim his role as the greatest movie villain of all time.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|This CD is a definite 4.5 in my book but Amazon just doesn't like half stars.    I love Rolling in the Deep and Set Fire to the Rain. Turning Tables is just a wonderfully lush arrangement and I am finding myself getting fonder and fonder of Love Song. It's very '60s cabaret lounge-y but in a good way. There are a couple of songs I don't care for but that's more so due to my personal preference than a reflection of the songs themselves. Number four - Don't you Remember, I just don't care for the country feel of it and number eight, I'll Be Waiting, too Dusty Springfield for my liking. The pacing of the lyrics don't quite meet up with the music. But that's just my opinion so if someone likes them, I won't quibble as I'm musically uneducated. Only got my ears to use as a tool.    Adele is probably gonna clean up at the Grammys next year with this offering.      I wish there were more artists like her and less like Katy Perry.
B003QTBT5C|2.0|I'm wondering if the positive reviewers have even heard the album, or have listened to past Apocalyptica stuff, because nearly every freakin' song on this album sounds the same. I love Apocalyptica but this album is unfortunately weak and dull. There are three songs on here I consider memorable and one of those three (Through Paris in a Sportscar) can only be found on the deluxe edition. The other two are Rage of Poseidon, which reminds me a lot of \\"To Tame A Land\\" by Iron Maiden with its unusual chord progression, and End of Me, with Gavin Rossdale. The rest just bores me and most of it sounds the same. I haven't even bothered to watch the DVD yet, which is funny as I bought this in August when it came out.<br /><br />Overall I think this album is their weakest and most dull yet. It's quite clear they're tired, just not trying anymore.

B004ISVH6G|5.0|This is from my post, I couldn't do an actual review until the release date. I bought this cd from England on E bay, it came out in Europe in January. I have listened to it for the past week and really love it, it is very fresh, not 80's sounding, John looks forward, not back (yes he re-groves some older material, but makes it more \\"Modern\\"). As a fan I put this Cd up there with his best, and recommend it wholeheartedly. My import has 12 tracks. The 11th track is a remake of \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" (very good), and the the 12th is \\"Hanging Tree\\" (a very cool \\"story\\" tune). I really love all of the songs, there is really no \\"weak point\\" on this disc, no filler material (John does not bother with that). Here's what I think. I really Love the title song (Luis and John wrote it, works very well, wicked guitar riff), \\"Shadows\\" is \\"Born a single\\", \\"Evil\\" has a \\"catchy groove\\" and was a Kyle Cook and John Waite joint\\", \\"If you ever get lonely\\" is \\"100% awesome Waite\\", \\"skyward\\" has got a real \\"Feel good song\\" vibe to it, \\"Sweet Rhode Island Red\\" is a Tina Turner song and John \\"Just nails it, it is killer\\", \\"Love's...\\" and \\"Better off gone\\" are very good songs, very memorable, \\"Further the sky\\" is one track that I listened to and liked it more with each visit, not that its a negative, it's just got a different feel, and finally \\"Peace of mind\\" is one of my favorites, it is a departure from all of his other songs in the way that he narrates the story in spoken word, (I have heard him speak in videos, but I don't think in songs before) very cool idea, great song, really!. John is on tour supporting this album, do yourself a favor and check him out, it is worth every penny!!!

After getting it set up I sat down and watched the first two episodes.  I was hooked and now every evening after work we sit down with our dinners and watch an episode.  The quality is excellent (just slightly less than full HD)and we look forward to our quiet time in the evening.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a way to sit together and enjoy the show.

I think that it helped carry the reader to the third book, but it suffers from being the \\"middle\\" book. The story picked up about half way through and took off. When it was over I couldnt wait to buy the third book.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|If you don't like this one, then you don't REALLY like rock'n'roll, blues or jazz or you have have been living under a rock for too long...  even if you don't like this jazzy, swingy, rockabilly, bluesy style, I guarantee this music will be a success at almost any party for young folks as well as older folks and that is hard to do...     Les Paul was the Guitar God who also invented many of the recording techniques and music technologies that are still important to the entire world today... He deserves to be a bigger legacy than most people know... I had the privilege to meet Les  and hang out with him briefly for one evening about 20 years ago and his charisma and professionalism just knocked me out.  This music here is a GREAT way to honor the man!!!   It captures a lot of his spirit and the soul that he streamed in his artistry and musical dialogues --- Jeff Beck definitely summoned his spirit and I bet that the presence of Les Paul was really felt by the artists and audiences here as the music just exudes heavenly vibrations and really connects to another dimension....    I have always loved Jeff Beck... I saw him and the Yardbirds (with Jimmy Page) in the 60's and I loved his guitar style and the music from this band alot ---  I loved  his style 20 years ago but I think he is now better than ever... He is a musician's musician but highly charismatic to almost anyone who will give his music a couple of listens...    I literally wore out my Jeff Beck Beckola and Truth vinyl albums from the later 60's that had Rod Stewart singing great blues and with a band that included other legends like John Paul Jones and with guest appearances by Jimmy Page I believe... those albums really rocked and Jeff Beck evolved into one of the truly innovative guitar artists of the 20th Century and now the 21st Century... His style of eloquent jazz rock fusion is something else... I love Clapton, Page, Bonamassa, BB King, Django Reinhart, Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf and a few other Jazz, Blues, Rock Guitarists, but I sincerely believe Jeff Beck has risen to the top of them all... just check out his Live at Ronny Scott's recording and Video and also some of his earlier solo work... if you are a musician, you will really appreciate his music projects, but if you just like good rock n' roll, this album is soooo--- good for any one that wants to rock out or listen to party music fun!... This may be the most accessible Jeff Beck music for the global audience of any recordings that Jeff has put out in his lifetime...     Imelda May who sings lead on quite a few tunes is drop dead smokin' perfect for this project!!!!   I really love her authentic take on How High the Moon, Sitting on Top of the World, Bye Bye Blues, Vaya Con Dios and the other Les Paul tunes and certainly she has few tricks up sleeves in terms of her approach for this project on all songs she sings which is really cool!!!... she really captures Les Paul's wife Mary Ford in spirit and Imelda is just a knockout singer period.... get her CDs too if you like this album  (i.e. Johnny Got a Boom Boom is truly a song that will stick in your memory)... The other guests including Brian Setzer, Darrel Higham, Gary US Bonds and Trombone Shorty are just fantastic and the mix of artists and the tunes selected is just perfect!!!!     WELL DONE PRODUCTION TEAM!!!! Great Band and Guests, Great Song Choices, Great Live Recording --- THANK YOU JEFF!!!    I saw the PBS special and had to get the CD when it came out  and I couldn't stop listening to this music the moment the CD arrived from Amazon (I also ordered the Blue Ray) ...and I believe there is some music on the CD not seen on the Video --- i.e. The Train It Kept A Rolling which the Yardbirds with Jeff Beck did way back in the 1960's (The band Aerosmith and Led Zepplin amongst others copied this song but IMO the Yardbirds version with Jeff Beck and the Yardbirds really did the song justice and to hear Jeff play it again here on this CD is a real treat....    If you want to Boogie to something really good, get this music and expect to move your feet and/or feel the songs in your soul!    THIS ALBUM ROCKS AND ROCKS and ROLLS AND ROLLS.... HEY LET'S PARTY!!!!!   HOLD THAT TIGER ---MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!!!!!
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Although the Fatal Attraction story has been told several times, Obsessed puts a new spin on it.  I would describe it as suspenseful but still predictable.  This is a great thriller movie.
1591843162|2.0|As many people say, it could be shorter and more concise enough to convey the concept \\"Linchpin\\". He repeated hundreds of times the importance of remarkable, being stand-out, being a linchpin in our organization. I knew it so badly that I sort of expected how to be like that. To my question, he ended up making a conclusion that there is no map to be linchpin. What's the point? He's spent too much time just focusing on saying the importance of being linchpin. I've spent too much time on listening to the same message over and over again, with very few helpful messages to be a linchpin. I've seen his tip to be a linchpin numerous times from other banal selp-help books so far. In this sense, this book is not an art too. It's just a banal, which he hated so much.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Disney has beautiful, fun and great movies. But Beauty and The Beast is by far my favorite of all. I grew with this classic and now with this total new restoration on Blu-ray is a total new experience. I was looking for this movie since its release. The artwork is beautiful, very shining. The movie of course, Excellent! and is loaded with many, many interesting bonus features. Really this is a must own for any Hi-Def collection.
B003O86MY8|4.0|I reallly liked it. I had only recently heard of Dave Garrett and was hooked. Since I love Trans Siberian Orchestra and Manheim Steamroller, I put this album in that category, sort of, only I like the fact that Dave Garrett plays individual rearranged music of various genres. He's great.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|A truthful account of the current health care system in this country.  A must see for anyone wanting to learn more about the current system.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I liked Pearl Jam when I was growing up and always enjoyed Eddie Vedder's voice.    The  \\"Into The Wild\\" soundtrack is Eddie on his own with almost a dozen songs that are mostly shorter acoustic pieces.    His music really worked well in the movie and also as a stand alone record.  Haunting and thoughtful pieces.  Setting Forth is a great song and The Wolf is very interesting piece.    If you are a Pearl Jam Fan, more so when they moved into their newer sounds on recent records, you will like this and it is highly recommended.
B000WD66BM|5.0|Había escuchado a esta banda muy poco pero tenía curiosidad de escuchar este Cd y en verdad que supero mis espectativas, tiene un gran sonido las letras, la música y la voz de Tarja en todo su esplendor, si eres fan de Nightwish no dejes de escuchar este Cd, esta increible, y por supuesto solo lo encontré en Amazon.com. Altamente recomendable.
B001UW58WW|5.0|This album is fantastic. I liked Rock Symphonies, but I loved this one entitled only \\"David Garrett.\\" I love all the arrangements and I keep playing it over and over. What he does with the violin is fantastic. I'm a big fan now. His arrangement of Bach's Air is beautiful. Smooth Criminial is really great too. I love them all.
030746363X|1.0|Most of the 5-star reviews for 4HB came up on the first day.  Given that Tim Ferriss has previously endorsed outsourcing in his Four Hour Workweek, I wonder how many of those 5-star reviews were from his personal assistants abroad.<br /><br />Let me start with my bona fides: I am a currently practicing and licensed physician in the state of California. I graduated from Stanford University School of Medicine. I am a black belt and a lifelong athlete, and I have been weight training for over 20 years-- and unlike Mr. Ferriss, without injuring myself in any way, ever. I have no financial interest in his book or any other product discussed here.<br /><br />Regarding the depth of my review of The 4-Hour Body, I spent over [...] on the equipment, supplements, and ultrasound machine recommended in the book. I bought the BodyMetrix Professional ultrasound and software he recommends by Intelametrix ([...] after discount for mentioning 4HB book), and completed the 1-on-1 online training despite the fact I am previously certified in performing ultrasound.  I engaged my friends and colleagues in a \\"Fat off\\" competition with obsessive and objective weight and body fat measurements and followed the routine for 5 weeks as perfectly as I was able. I also experimented (like Mr. Ferriss) using continuous glucose measurement (CGM) to assess minute-to-minute glucose responses to food and exercise using both the DexCom system he recommends as well as the MiniMed Guardian system.  I plan to upload a photo of the nutritional supplements I bought, which nearly cover my kitchen table.  I downloaded apps to my phone for recording each workout obsessively, and more importantly to help with the very slow rep time he recommends.<br /><br />My basic finding is that after trying the diet, supplements, exercise routines and lifestyle changes recommended in the 4-Hour Body that I found no change, whatsoever, in body weight or competition. Nor did any of my other friends trying the book.<br /><br />Why doesn't the 4HB work?<br /><br />(1) It takes more than 4 hours a month in the gym to have a great body.  I'm sorry, it just does. Mr. Ferriss recommends performing 2-3 SETS, for a total of less than 30 reps, per WEEK, to get a great body. Ask any athlete, bodybuilder, trainer... not enough. Not even close. It's hogwash. I actually could feel my body dwindling despite eating as much protein as I could stomach.<br /><br />(2) Almost all the supplements recommended in 4HB have never been scientifically proven to do what Mr. Ferriss claims they do. Take cissus quadrangularis (page 110), costs about $30 for 120 capsules. He discusses that he took CQ in China while eating a high volume rice diet with sweets and states \\"CQ preserved my abs\\". Really?  If that's the level of evidence that you're comfortable with, great. But with simultaneous exercise, multiple other ongoing supplements, lifestyle changes, etc., who can tell whether it was CQ or just dietary changes from his being in rural China?<br /><br />(3) The diet is just a mishmash of other diet routines, basically Atkins plus paleo with a dash of South Beach Diet.  There are important flaws in the diet that should be pointed out. He recommends carbohydrates from beans instead of \\"white carbohydrates\\", hence the \\"slow-carb\\" diet. This relies on a bunch of old data regarding glycemic index. The reality about carbohydrate digestion is very different. Carbohydrate digestion is so important that it begins IN THE MOUTH with salivary amylase. Whether you eat a slice of Wonder Bread or a handful of garbanzo beans, the breakdown of these sugars into the body's currency of glucose is extremely rapid and effective regardless of which form you ingest it in.  I have tried this myself using continuous glucose monitoring as recommended in the book.  The only way I have found to blunt the sugar rise is simultaneous ingestion of a good quantity of fat.  Also, can a diet really be paleo without milk or dairy?  And did early Homo sapiens farm for beans and lentils?<br /><br />(4) The blood sugar response data in the book is flawed by a misunderstanding of how continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) works. He notes \\"it turned out foods and liquids took much, much longer to get to my bloodstream than one would expect.\\" But the DexCom SEVEN implant he was using has a 20-30 minute delay between the blood sugar reading you get on a finger stick, and the blood sugar reading on the machine sensor. That is, there is a BUILT IN DELAY (check some online diabetic forums for more info on this) because capillary blood from fingersticks shows changes much faster and more accurately than the interstitial fluid surrounding the implant. So, as noted in (3), sugar responses are actually very fast. Drink that protein shake right before or after the workout, not 1 hour prior like he says.<br /><br />(5) Measuring body fat before and after interventions is much less easy than implied in the book. Body scans using DEXA are really great, but it's hard to convince all your friends to do it with you given inconvenience and expense. I have used the ultrasound unit he recommends and even with training it is very difficult for me to get reliable, repeatable data. This is true even when I have switched it to expert \\"M\\" mode and done my own curve fitting of the actual ultrasound output.  It is also very dependent on the body type you select for yourself when you calibrate the machine.<br /><br />(6) The sex improvement section seems out of place in this book, and is not terribly original to boot.<br /><br />Here's what you can learn from 4HB without buying the book:<br />  ---Measure your body fat (!) before and after any change you make in your diet.<br />  ---If a book makes unrealistic claims, don't believe it.<br />  ---Have your friends join you in challenges and short contests.<br />  ---Exercise consistently over years...and be more careful with your body than Mr. Ferriss is.apiens farm for beans and lentils?<br /><br />(4) The blood sugar response data in the book is flawed by a misunderstanding of how continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) works.

B0036TGSJ4|4.0|I received the movie in a timely manner.  There were no scratches or damage of any kind to the disc or the case considering I bought it used.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book has a few really good short stories featuring my favorite character, Percy Jackson. It also has a good insight to The Lost Hero, but you don't know it until you read both books. I recommend it to anyone who liked the Percy Jackson series. Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i could not even put this book down.  i read the whole series in less than a week.  you will fall in love with the characters
B004NYQYNQ|3.0|I most of the songs sound good. Some songs made me go eh and some I said I really like this. The MAJOR thing I have a problem with is the production and the way she sings. Live she is so amazing but its like they dont want her to sound good. Listen to Someone like you and Take it All live and you see its puts the studio version to shame. Its okay to sing better live there are lots of singers in their prime that sounded better than the studo like whitney and mariah but some of adeles studio version just make me cringe. Am I the only one?
1556438850|4.0|Even though I haven't read the whole book through, from what I've seen from \\"Teaching Yoga: Essential Foundations and Techniques\\", is a really good stepping stone so far.<br /><br />I would be more than happy to recommend this to any of my fellow \\"yoginis\\", and am eager to let (you) AMAZON know what benefits and/or rewards I receive from this item!
142311339X|5.0|This book is awesome, I highly recommend it. The narration was fast-paced and humorous and I have at least 25 highlights from this book on my kindle. Anyone who has read the Percy Jackson series MUST look at this book. Enjoy!
1594202842|5.0|I am humbled by how much work the tiger mom was willing to do for her daughters future. One thing I have to say is there is definitely good genes in her family. Besides proper child rearing, hard work on children's part, genes definitely play a huge role in the kids' future. This is a great book for parents, even if you have different opinions, it is great to hear a different perspective. I admire the tiger mom's strength as a working mom and a busy law professor. I really love the example she used about rejecting her daughters' lousy birthday card. How many parents out there have the courage to do that? Inwardly don't we all agree our kids can do better?
B003GDYN24|5.0|I am a huge Kelis fan so when writing my revies I try not to be biased. Intially I wasnt feeling the tracks but one Saturday while cleaning I popped itg in and found myself rushing to the computer to repeat some of the songs. I really like the dance tracks on the cd..its diffrent and definately good. If at first you do not like it just give it a try. I wish she would do some tour dates in the U.S. Kelis dress in the 4th of July video is bomb.com by the way lol.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are<br /><br />Home( REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT)<br />Brave (REPEAT X1000000)<br />Acapella<br />4th of July<br />22nd Century!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;&lt;&lt; My Fave!!!!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Thanks to Amazon for getting the cd to me quickly.   I had never heard of this group until seeing them on the Grammys recently.   Their sound and style immediately stuck a chord.   A friend described them as folk with a twist.      I've been listening to their tunes on youtube and enjoy every single one of them.   The Cave is still my favorite, but all of the songs on this cd are terrific.     Positively one of the best groups I've heard in a long time.   I wish them continued success and many more tunes for all of us to enjoy.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was so captivated by this book, I hurried through chores, read it every chance I had to pull out my Kindle and absorb even a few paragraphs. I am anxious to begin devouring The Girl Who Played With Fire... Bravo Stieg Larsson.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I couldn't put this book down.  I have only read 3 Michael Connelly books and loved them all, but this one is by far my favorite.
0060899220|5.0|This was the last book that I was supposed to read in a book club at work before I dropped out of the club.  The idea of reading a book about a cook was totally uninteresting to me.  I have worked as a waiter and a dishwasher and there was nothing fun or interesting about it.  It was a way to make money, when I couldn't find anything better.   I cook my own food every now and then, but I find chopping veggies, reducing sauces and boiling pasta necessary evils with nothing redeeming about the process--only the end result. Then there are the mounds of pans, dishes and utensils to wash.    Recently on the recommendation of my son, I started viewing Anthony Bourdain's TV shows on the travel channel. I started with his shows on places I know well and I was amazed at how he found great places to eat that I had never hard of.  But mostly I liked his lyrical descriptions of people and places and the food the locals make.  That inspired me to read his last book--Medium Raw and then the book I passed up 10 years ago.    I will say this about the author--he may not always be right, but he's never at a loss for words.  He's arrogant and opinionated and probably obnoxious in person.  I don't find anything inspiring about his drug abuse and sexual depredations with waitresses.  I can say for sure there was none to little of that in any joint I worked in, and to the extent there was, it was with partners anyone with a brain would pass up.  I suspect that this book probably needs a legend on the cover that says, \\"Inspired by real events.\\"  It reads like one of Norman Mailer's, nonfiction novels, with some interesting vignettes, breathlessly hyperbolized to make the author seems cool when he is really just wretched.    One of my colleagues was married to a woman who in her middle age decided to go to cooking school. After cooking school, she found the chefs where she worked to be abusive and paranoid. They wouldn't teach anyone anything, because the chef was afraid they would leaveand take the chef's secrets with them.    I'm glad that Anthony Bourdain survived his self abuse. His book about his failures was a fun read, if you like to read about people trying to destroy themselves and somehow managing to rise above it.  But there was also some good insight into the restaurant business.  I now won't ever get fish on a Monday.  I do like going out to dinner during the week, and now I know why that's a good idea.  I'm glad to see that he has helped everyone understand how tough it is to work in a restaurant and put out hundreds of meals per day, exactly the same way in a hot, cramped environment.  But then I knew that already.  If you don't, this is the book for you.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|i WOULD BUY THIS cd AGAIN. EVERY SONG IS GREAT - ALL TUNES ARE PLAYABLE AS A HIT ON RADIO
1401225756|5.0|I was actually required to buy this book for a class and it turned out to be an excellent read. Though it can be a bit hokey at times with some misguided DC tie-ins, Neil Gaiman is a master storyteller and it really shows through in the book. Also, I loved the new updated art in comparison to my classmates. The only real problem was a lack of page numbers but it didn't bother me that much and made the novel a bit cleaner. I definitely plan on ordering and reading the rest of the series now.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is among my top Gregg Allman performances and song collections. I put it in a class with the first four Allman Bros. albums and, coming from me, that is the highest compliment I can pay this new CD. I have been stopping people on the street and calling friends to rush out and buy this one. Do not wait. It will likely be among your top 5 recordings. Considering the size of my music collection, that is not an easy feat.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|Love this move, especially the minion's.  This is a great movie for children of all ages as well as adults.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie. I bought it  for my grandson, Oliver, but his older brother is the one who just loves it. He is 4 years old. My Oliver is only 7 months old, so he doesn't have an opinion yet. Great movie! Typical Disney at it's best.
0679746323|5.0|Mao was the Greatest monster of the 20th century. I trust this book, Because the amount of research that was put into it. There has never been such an exhaustive researched Biography on any World Leaders life like this one, from what i know. It totally demolishes any of the propaganda that Mao made up about himself. He my of been one wise guy, but it was an evil wise. And all he wanted was absolute power over his country; and not his only, the whole world. I will finish with this; Mao was cold hearted, self Loving, Leader, who liked nothing beater then to see people suffer so that he might have power.
0321701763|5.0|I have been taking college level Photoshop classes since Summer 2008.  \\"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Classroom in a Book\\" is an excellent manual for beginners who wish to learn to effectively use Photoshop.  While this book is titled for the CS5 version of Photoshop, I believe much of what is taught here is applicable to CS4 and (to a lesser extent) CS3.  If you read each chapter, use the photo examples provided on the CD, and do the work while reading, you will learn how to perform Photoshop functions.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I think like a lot of people, I got into Firefly well after it had been canceled, but a friend had recommended me the show, and Amazon had the DVD box set [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]] on sale along with Serenity so I picked up both and enjoy them, and my roommates like it, too.
0307346617|4.0|I loved the book(Kindle). This is less of a review as it is more of a rating (4/5) *I dont really rate media items 5*  Well written and well executed. The short \\"chapters\\" make it an easy read.    -J

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I've seen half of the theatrical cut, then stopped and switched to this version.  It's far better and I intend to refer to \\"Watchmen\\" as this version in the same way I refer to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as the extended versions only.    As far as the quality of the film--I find it great.  But it's not one that I'd recommend to everyone.  Unfortunately I think it is best slated as an excellent companion piece to the graphic novel.  Sit down and read the graphic novel, and if you love it, watch the movie.  I believe the kind of person that wouldn't be into reading the novel but would still watch and love this movie aren't too many in number.  So keep that in mind.    All of that said, this is by far the best film adaptation of a book or comic book I've ever seen.  What makes it so good?   (Spoiler alert)    1) The interpretation to film.  Snyder has a great eye for visuals, and he clearly worked very hard to put many shots into the film that were directly inspired by the art in the graphic novel.  This helps you truly feel like you're watching the novel come to life, but not that you're watching a comic book.  2) The casting and acting.  All of the performances in this movie I would rate as good to stellar.  Dr. Manhattan and Laurie were \\"good.\\"  Crudup's Manhattan was stale and stiff (no jokes, please), but then that's how he is in the novel.  So what to do?  Gugino was good as Laurie, but hers was not a show-stealing performance.  The top performances go to     --Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl II--or really Dan Drieberg, which is where he really shines.  He has just the right awkwardness around Laurie, just the right uncertainty of himself, and you feel the displacement and forgottenness of Dan in Patrick's eyes.     --Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian.  First of all, he really looked the part.  Everyone else looked good or okay, but Morgan came out as the spitting image of his comic book counterpart.  And as I'm watching him burn the Northern Vietnamese or shoot his pregnant mistress or beat Silk Spectre onto a pool table just before trying to raper her, I found myself hating him just like I did when I read the book.     --Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach.  This is the performance that should have at least gotten an Oscar nod.  Haley's voice was exactly the way it should have sounded, and his portrayal of Kovacs was endlessly more sinister and unsettling than the way it came across in the novel.  Seriously--read the parts of the novel again that focus on the unmasked Rorschach, and then watch those scenes in the movie.  Which version scares you more?  When he's in the psychotherapy session, he is much more clearly messing with the analyst.  When he gets aprehended after throwing grease on that guy in prison, his line, \\"None of you seem to understand . . .\\" was excecuted perfectly.  And when he completely loses it while facing down Dr. Manhattan at the end, he closes off a flawless performance.  3) The changes from the story.  These always piss off the fanboys, but every change I saw in the movie either had no impact on the story (Laurie's smoking, changing \\"Crimebusters\\" to \\"Watchmen,\\" and making that Ozymandias's idea rather than Captain Metropolis's, the way Rorschach killed the little girls' murderer, cutting off that dude's arms rather than just slitting his throat, etc.), were the right move for the sake of the film (oil-powered cars still in prominence, leaving out the parallel story of The Black Freighter, having Archie land closer to Ozzy's palace so they can walk instead of ride floating Segways, shortening Rorschach's psychotherapy sessions to a single session, etc.), or were vast improvments over the original story (The ending--without a doubt.  Having the false enemy be Dr. Manhattan instead of a nameless alien race, and having cities all over the world effected rather than one neighborhood of New York made the ending much more gripping and personal.)  4) The nods and small references throughout the movie.  There were theobvious ones, such as the cameos of the newstand and the kid reading The Black Freighter, but there are also a couple shots near the beginning of Captain Metropolis and Hooded Justice obviously flirting with one another, the alien squid's cameo, and the list goes on.  It's important and good that Snyder did this because it's acknowledgements to things he had to leave out but didn't want to be ignored.  It states that he cares about the source material.    I have a few small gripes here and there, but I don't want to list them and taint a positive review.  If you watch it, find your own gripes, if you find any.    So don't pop this movie in and expect to love it if you don't like comic book movies.  It's also best viewed after reading the graphic novel, as it brings it to life masterfully.  4.5 stars.
B004G8ZZHU|4.0|LOL! Great movie.  I bought this movie for a friend's son who was going to be visiting.  He ended up playing video games and we ended up watching the film!  It was really entertaining.  I'm 50-something and missed the A-Team first time around--  had better stuff to do.  I thought I'd miss it this time, but it was a really entertaining film.  My favorite line was pretty deliberate by the screen writer and my \\"hats off\\" to him.  The bad guys had an Iragi printing press and some USD $100 plats and were going to \\"print billions of 'unbacked' American Dollars\\"!  OMG, the Fed is doing that every day!  Loved the flick and \\"GO Ron Paul, audit the fed!\\"
B0015DROBO|3.0|I have no problem recommending this book to others to read. Lately I've been surfing the Kindle charts and looking for good books to read, but some of the best ones are not even on the bestseller charts. Through the discussion board I learned about \\"Bankroll Squad\\" by David Weaver, bought it for $2 and loved it. Then of course I loved \\"Tick Tock,\\" which was a nice read as well.
B000000OQY|1.0|Recently I was talking to an old friend of mine and we were talking about how great Guns N' Roses are when I realized that while I could remember Appetite For Destruction and Use Your Illusion 1 & 2  I had trouble remembering Lies.  My friend said \\"Don't you remember the song Patience?\\" and I was like \\"Oh!  Of course, how could I forget\\"?!  To make a long story short I thought I would \\"revisit\\" the album and to figure out how the hell I could actually forget about an entire album from a band I freakin' love.  Well, now that I've listened to each song I remember that back then when it came out (I was around 17 years old) I remember thinking the album cover was cool looking but that the album SUCKED HARD!!!!  After Appetite For Destruction, this album was a piece of \\"Fluff\\" in my mind back then and still is now that I've heard it again.
B003102JDM|2.0|There is a trend in this world, we want things to be different, just because we are so bored with our lives and the things we do. People don't appreciate anything these days, we're bored in the greatest country in the world and nothing is ever good enough. The Serious Man is one of those films that claims to be different, but is different always good? When someone tells me to try frog legs because it taste like chicken, I tell them, \\"then why not eat chicken?... and spare my imagination, overthrow my will to force myself to eat something that doesn't appeal to me\\"? What does this have to do with this movie? Nothing! Watching this film, you will feel this sensation every once and a while.<br /><br />While I was intrigued watching this film, which is very aggravating on purpose, I found myself wondering where it was going. It didn't take long before I realized it didn't have anywhere to go. After a pretty nonsensical beginning, we meet a Jewish man who is going through a rough spot in his life, problems at work, with his marriage, family members, religion and life in general. The ending is left open for a reason, how do you end this kind of film?...with an ambiguous open to self interpretation type of ending, that's how.<br /><br />As you watch this poor guy go through lots of unpleasant and stressful situations(even the Columbia House Record Club scam seems a bigger problem because it's just piled on top of everything else), as we overhear a conversation with his Dr. over the phone, he learns at the very end of the film that he could have a serious illness and looking at the sky outside there's a good chance that his family and property could be in immediate and serious jeopardy!<br /><br />The ending to me basically says, no matter how bad you think your life is, it could be worse.....much worse! As I stated earlier in my review, this film intrigued me, but when it was over I wasn't really impressed....not one of the best from the Coen brothers if you ask me.
B000GGSMB2|4.0|Scarface is one of those movies that is known by any movie person out there.  I know I was one of those but never seen the movie 'til in recent years for the first time and I wasn't sure why I missed out on this movie in the first place.  If there's anything that I can say is that sure while this movie the 'F' word is said over 200 times throughout the course of nearly 3 hours of movie, but that shouldn't stop anyone from giving this movie a watch if you haven't already.  I firmly believe that Al Pacino delivered one of his best performances in this movie and makes 'Tony Montana' believable character in any movie that I've seen over the years.<br /><br />If there's anything I can say is that I never expected a movie about any kind of 'drug lord' would ever interest me in any way like this one has and to this day this one is still the only one that.  The writing is probably one of the best out of the whole 80s.  Scarface although ranks as one of my movies in my Top 10 movies overall and one of the little features that they included was a 'F-Bomb' count so you can keep track of how many times the word is used as well as a 'bullet monitor'.  If anything I know how the movie ended before I watched it but that didn't stop me from watching it to understand what the hype about the movie was all about that I heard so much over the years.  Overall I give this 4.5 stars out of 5.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|The Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Sharpener works pretty well.  I ran several of my Gerber knives through this little sharpener and it put a nice edge on all of them.  What I like about this sharpener is that it is designed to sharpen knives with serrations.  Personally, I prefer to use a knife with serrations. I found the sharpener to be a bit small, but it is considered a `pocket sharpener.'  And I will admit, I have fat fingers.  Other than that, you can't go wrong with this little sharpener.  For less than $10 I bought myself a second one.
0316287059|5.0|I haven't actually received the package yet but I wasn't sure who to contact about the tracking information, it was available for \\"tracking\\" but everytime I tried to it would say it was \\"Unavailable at this time\\" every single time I tried it, so that's kind of disheartening. I mean if it can't be tracked then don't say that the product can, I'm not sure who is in charge of that option, whether it's the seller or whomever, but I did want to gripe about that a little, so that whomever sees this can fix it in the future.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These clip on VERY secure, have an OEM look to them and feel. They make a huge difference when it comes to range of motion for the L2/R2 buttons (even though every game I've played barely uses them) I tried squeezing the heck out of them to see if they pop off and NOPE they do not pop off. They have little tabs that surround the button to prevent this, however if I pull on them with enough force they come right off with no damage to anything. Definitely worth 5 bucks!
B00005RDRO|4.0|Murder by Death is a nice sendup for those fans who relish detective novels. Based on Neil Simon's screenplay, the film utilizes well-timed wit and spoof to entertain. Although nonsensical at points, much of the film's power resonates in its \\"who done it\\" murder mystery approach and mood, and has a wonderful cast and great humor throughout. It is not a film to bash for seeming silly and preposterous mainly because it embraces the nonsense with good fun. While watching, I was reminded often of the 1985 film Clue, a spinoff of the popular detective board game, in which we meet various characters of the game who try to solve the murder at the film's beginning.     In Murder By Death, Mr. Lionel Twain (played by Truman Capote) has given invitations to a select and elite group of literary sleuths (Agatha Christie, Perriot, Sam Shade among others)  and his proposition is quite unusual: they will meet, dine and then solve a murder that will take place AFTER they arrive. The best of  the detective business arrive one by one to the estate of Lionel Twain, but seem to be puzzled as to the motive of bring all together. They arrive, and Twain makes an auspicious entrance, and then boasts to giving one million dollars to the one who can solve the crime that will happen at exactly midnight. When the murder takes place, motives abound, and no one is quite sure who to trust. They do all this in a slapstick, silly sort of way as we try to follow along and solve the mystery. Great dialogue and witty lines make this worth some of the mistakes. I thought Peter Falk did an exceptional job as Spade, too!     The ending to the film might have been thought out better, but still, it is a great dinner movie, and one that fans of the murder literary world will appreciate. There is a short interview with Neil Simon, but I wasn't that impressed with it. Over all, still, a nice addition  to the DVD library.
0452287022|4.0|i love a story...as long as it is relatively well written i'll give it at least a three....this story was about a 3and a half...it could have been fleshed out and there could have been so much more flavor given to this story...i love the painting of the \\"girl...earring\\"...her eyes seems to be on the verge of telling a deep and compelling story...the telling of the tale was adequate...but not at all as complelling as the look in the eyes of the girl...unless a novel is an absolute horror...i hesitate in negatively judging the hard work of an author...but i cannot recommend it unless the reader will be satisfied with just... okay
B000YB4G32|4.0|I am late to The Killers party and just recently got into them in the last 3 months.  Better late than never!!  I love Hot Fuss and found Sam's Town to be spotty with really only 3-4 tracks that I really like.  I recently downloaded Sawdust and wasn't expecting much, but wanted to get it to help fill my Killers collection.    I am very happy with this release. To me it actually sounds like a more coherent release then Sam's Town and can see why they maybe released this since Sam's Town had such poor reviews from the critics.  The problem with ST was that it was too much of a stretch.   Everything taht worked with Hot Fuss' theme of all the songs being somewhere connected is what ruined Sam's town.  The Killers tried to force something that wasn't there.    With this release, it is interesting to hear The Killers just playing with no larger goal.  Just a collection of songs they covered or recorded over the years.  Shadowplay is just spectacular.  Perhaps my favorite track by The Killers.    Summary - would recommend this over Sam's Town anyday.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Purchased the Gift-Set. Love the film, the bonus DVD about Gollum was packaged extremely well and came with a nice book. The statue is extremely nice too and well made. Its 2011, haha, so this set is a little out-of-print. But if you can find it for a good price like me, $17, then pick it up.
030746363X|2.0|Seriously Tim, how may people are you paying to write 5 star reviews?  Are you taking a page out of the 4 Hour Workweek and hiring people from India to write reviews for $5 a pop? I've never seen anything like it. You are averaging 50 to 100 5 star reviews in the span of a few days... not even J.K. Rowling could claim such \\"success\\". But hey, good for you, it's keeping you out of a horrible 9-5. Anyway, most people are buying this for the diet.  The \\"diet\\" he talks about is the slow carb diet, and that only takes up a handful of pages.  Other pages are devoted to graphic drawings on how to  manually bring a women to orgasm.  Useful?  Maybe.  Certainly causes a minor stir on public transportation.  Anyway, there are other slow carb diet books out there that will give you a lot more information than you will get here, so only spend the money if you are a fan of the author, or are having \\"relationship issues\\" with the misses and could use a helping, ahem, hand.
B000FCK9D6|3.0|I'm a great Agatha Christie fan. So this was one of the first books I bought for my kindle. I love the book. 5 stars for that. But the spelling errors were horrific!! Especially words running into each other (are those considered spelling errors?) Anyway; it's very irritating and distracting. It seems like no one proof read the kindle version. The e-book is cheaper but we do pay money for it. I wish they would put just a bit more effort into it.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Adele's 19 was strong. 21 is simply timeless.<br /><br />In the past two years, Adele has refined and reinvented her unique sound that always puts her aching yet powerful vocals and lyrics at the forefront. These are songs that could have been released in the 60s as easily as 30 years from now. Adele has injected her trademark piano ballads with the best from several different musical genres including Americana roots and country, r&b, blues and gospel. The music is exciting and simply is. It lives, breathes.<br /><br />There are a few tracks towards the middle that are remarkable only because Adele sings them-- and while they aren't quite filler, they aren't as memorable as standout tracks like \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" \\"Set Fire to the Rain,\\" \\"Someone Like You,\\" and \\"Turning Tables.\\" Adele set the bar so high with these songs that anything else short of magic, is sort of a letdown. However, as a whole--this album so involves you that you can feel these stories as your own.<br /><br />I played a couple songs for my mom, who at forty years older than I, generally criticizes my music taste, and the first thing she said was \\"Wow, this girl really knows how to write a story--those songs are beautiful.\\"<br /><br />21 is haunting, pulsing, soaring and very intimate.  It's music that will be remembered.

There are parts that drag, but most of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance will stimulate thought and enjoyment. This book was a gift to me and I am going to give it to my brother. I look forward to discussing it with him. Not many book really hit me on this level.

B0048LPRD2|2.0|This film had real potential.  It was almost like watching a video game from first to second person drug play. The problem is that director Noe got caught up in his panning scenes.  There is so much traveling through walls and above buildings that the film is slowed down to a snails pace.  It could have been reduced by about 40 minutes to help move the film along.  Almost 40 minutes of slow sideways panning movement to represent the the out of body experience was far too much.  By the time the (in your face) punchline was reached, it was no longer worth the wait.  With a proper edit, this film could have been a winner.  As it is, it is finished after one viewing and very unsatisfying.  Good luck on staying awake through the thing.  Perhaps viewers should sit upright and drink a lot of coffee.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|At first glance this would NOT have been a movie I'd be interested in. Robbery, violence...no thanks. Once I discovered Ben Affleck was in it, that changed everything.<br /><br />THE TOWN was nothing short of amazing. Great acting. Great action. A great story to be told. And there was even a bit of romance for the romantic at heart like me.<br /><br />This movie will take you on a journey into the world of criminal life. One that many of us can't begin to phantom what's entailed. It was equally scary on a realistic level as well as painfully heart breaking. What some people are born into is nothing short of horrific.<br /><br />Doug is trapped in a world he realizes he no longer wants to be a part of. The only problem is he's not allowed to depart from it. Along the way he makes a few discoveries, falls in love, and wants a new life...to make something of himself.<br /><br />It's heart wrenchingly sad to see one trapped in a life they no longer want to be a part of. Though very much the bad guy, your heart will bleed for Doug, as you cry out for him to survive so he can have an opportunity to change his life around.<br /><br />This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. There wasn't a thing I'd change, it was so well thought out with outstanding acting, and a remarkable message of hope and love that will have you thinking of THE TOWN well after it's ended.
B000FC12C8|5.0|A great beginner book to learn more about value investing. I would say that if you don't agree with the methods mentioned in this book, then value investing is probably not the best investment scheme for you. However, for those who commented about Jason Zweig's additional footnotes and commentaries, I think everything he unfortunately added to this great book is a waste of time. His comments and suggestions, most of the time, go against (!!) what Graham is trying to teach in this wonderful book. He even suggests dollar-cost averaging method on pg. 225, which is pounded by Graham over and over again in the book. And yes, we could've done without the 'constant' mentions and references to the Money magazine in which he writes. What a shame that Mr. Buffett didn't write those commentaries. It would've been an even better classic than its original self.. But I guess Mr. Buffett has so much respect for this book that he would never interrupt it as Zweig does over and over again. I don't know if the original book is still being published without these useless commentaries and footnotes but I would've definetely bought it if I could.

1439156816|5.0|I've always been intrigued with Stephen King even though I've never read one of his books.  I listened to this one per the advice of an editor helping me with my manuscript.      I think Stephen King is hilarious.  I've never been a fan of horror. I will read some of his books now, thanks to my enlightened perspective.     I learned alot about Stephen King and writing.  I don't know why any aspiring writer wouldn't take the opportunity to listen to a man who has published over 50 best sellers.  What a great deal for a few bucks.      What did I learn?  Chronic reading and writing will make you better.  I needed to hear that from him.      I wish the book was longer or that he would do another one.     Now I can't wait to dig in and learn from some of his other books.      Plenty of great thoughts I will always remember.    Thanks Mr. King!

1594202842|2.0|After reading the WSJ article and listening to Amy Chua on NPR, I told myself I should read the book.   I started the book with a neutral point of view, the conclusion is that I still don't like the way she raised her kids, regardless whether they turned out to be ultra successful or not.  For me, I have certain `benchmark' points for reading memoirs - what did I learn from the book? Can I relate or sympathize with the author? Does the book make a difference or change the way I view things in a positive light?  For me, the answer is all `no'.      I finish the book nonetheless because I like Chua's writing style.

0670022411|3.0|I went into this novel hoping that the fact Bella, I mean Diana, was a grown and educated woman and that Edward, I mean Matthew, was a much older and more distinguished vampire not hiding as a teenager, would lead to a story wholly different than Twilight.    And in some senses it is.  Diana is a witch denying herself her power.  This world that Deborah E. Harkness has crafted lacks shirtless teenage werewolves or insipid mortal friends who prove to be a liability to the main character's progress, as well as the progress of the story.      The differences end there.  The basic plot of woman meets vampire, woman declines to admit vampire is dangerous, vampire insists he is dangerous, woman and vampire fall in love anyway is exactly what this story is.  For those of you who have read the Twilight series, no doubt it was impossible for you to draw comparisons between this novel and the last book in the Twilight series.  A lot of comparisons.  Too many comparisons, really.    My main complaint with this novel though was that I had no idea that it was the beginning of a series.  I was shocked to find that there were only 20 pages left in the book when the story was far from over, but it was still far from what the ending of a first book should be either.  This book could have been standalone and done very well.  And because the author chose not to finish the story, I have to agree with other reviewers that it was a play for money and that we could have done without the unneeded descriptions of Diana's hair and clothing or Matthew's car and pearly skin.    It's like when an escort tries to keep you busy by talking until the first hour is up and you have to pay for a second.  I'd have been much happier if the clothes had just come off in the first hour and I had gotten what I paid my money for.  Does this mean I won't pay for the second hour?  Er, I mean book?  No, I think I will.    Despite the comparisons, the characters were interesting and I look forward to the progression of Diana's powers, the secrets of Matthew being revealed and the inevitable showdown between the conventicle and the Volturi.  Dang it, I meant the Congregation.      I will not wait for the next book in anticipation like I did with the Harry Potter series or like I waited for The Ladies of Grace Adieu to be published after I read Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.  Most likely I will forget about Deborah E. Harkness' world and mythology until I accidentally run across book two while reading articles on the internet one day.  And I'll probably enjoy it and then put it on my shelf, never to be read again.
1599219751|5.0|This book is a very well written, fast read. It is riveting. It is about a young man who returned from a stint in the Polish army to find himself arrested by the Russians for no reason at all.  He was tortured, convicted, and sent to a prison camp in Siberia. With subtle help from an unlikely source, the commander's wife, he and 5 others escaped from the camp. Among them was an American engineer who had helped build the Moscow metro. The Russians thought the American was a spy. He never told the others his first name during their year and a half walk to India. That made me wonder if he was, indeed, a spy. At any rate, 4 of the original escapees made it to India with many close calls. This is a true story and is the amazing story of some very lucky, determined men. Wonderful book!
0802473156|1.0|Ok, I read this book at the prompting from my girlfriend. I have to say, I'm not a big fan of the self-help genre of books to begin with, but I'm not sure how someone could fill 13 chapters with this \\"concept\\". Frankly, the real genius behind the author's simple-minded book is stretching what should have fit onto 10 pages into 13 chapters. Well, that and convincing the public at large that this is a new and revolutionary idea.    Are we all really so dense that we can't figure out that people show/receive love and appreciation in different ways? And would we really have such a hard time putting together our own narrow list of ways to show/receive love?     Here are the 5 obscure ways the author has come up with to show/receive love:    1 - Words of affirmation - saying nice things to the person we love and avoiding criticism  2 - Quality Time - don't think this one needs more clarification  3 - Receiving gifts - ditto  4 - Acts of service - doing things for the one we love  5 - Physical touch - yes, some people like to be touched - who knew???     Yup, as you can plainly see, it's a list that wouldn't be too obvious to most of us ;-).    From the author's own pompous proclamation, he believes this book is so revolutionary that it's the answer to societies ills as it will strengthen the family unit and hence our national unity.    What scares me is that we may have a nation of people so incapable of critical thought, rationality, and skepticism that they actually benefit from this type of drivel. If that's the case, I think our societal ills run far too deep for a book like this to fix.    Maybe if we spent more time communicating with each other instead of reading these types of stupid, simple-minded books, we'd get along better.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|Sam Worthington's portrayal of an intensely physical vet coping with disability is superb. Driven by Jake's character, the classic hero's journey is one of hope and redemption, like \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga. All the cast did a spectacular job. WETA workshop and the actors deserve 5 stars. The myriad of talent involved brings alive the vitality and magic of forests at night, fungus lit up like jellyfish, light, life, and movement. This is likely the most beautiful film I have ever seen. At face value, the extended version Collected Extended Cut is not overly PC. Important pieces are reinstated, the opening sequence reveals Jake's miserable life on a miserable earth. The process of Jake's new bodily habitation is elaborated with the toughening of his feet as he runs through the forest, why Pandora has floating mountains is finally explained, as is the school.<br /><br />The mining pit reminds me of Butte, Montana, with its large EPA superfund site, reputedly replete with toxic mountain goats. I've known mining executives, but the role portrays a young temp for hire, not someone in charge; the character would be more convincing written with authority and played by an actor like Judi Dench. I enjoyed the line, \\"It is my job to keep you alive, I will not succeed,\\" but Cameron leaves no doubt he's anti-military in his \\"Capturing Avatar\\" rants. He reveals dilettante environmentalism coupled with an outsider view of Native peoples, and American Indians in particular. The film cannot ultimately transcend the director's clich&eacute;s. Of mixed ethnic heritage, I, and many others, are offended by Cameron's use of hackneyed tribal stereotypes; this exploitation is as dated as his silly fake African soundtrack. True Science Fiction reaches beyond 1960s vintage socio-political theology. If Cameron had remained true to Sci Fi, and not gone down the allegorical road, the blue skin and cat appendages would be fine. But the man is too literal, and thus insults the otherness of \\"the other\\" with narrow perceptions. Cameron gets off on fake buffalo hunting scenes and tribal dance cliches. His \\"Gaia\\" spirituality ultimately goes nowhere. The unfinished, essential vision quest Dreamwalker sequence (Deleted Scenes, Disk 3) reveals Cameron's view of Native religion, that it equals a biological, planetary computer port.<br /><br />The horrible chick-flick bellowing score at the close of the film is a shame to be muted; it does nothing for the story or the audience. Real tribal music, Brazilian beats, electronica, world fusion, or interesting composers with real talent like Stewart Copeland, Ry Cooder, or Rachid Taha would be appropriate. But Cameron treats listeners to old style orchestral movie-music, as bland and false as Paul Simon wheezing over the top of African musicians back in the 1980s. This choice accompanies Cameron's dated and foolish crude language, as out of place as 1960s/70s fringe. Oh, but fringe is there, in spades! What a shame no one had the gumption to reign in Cameron's agenda and prevent Blue Dances With Coyotes, Yip-Yip. Once your eyes adjust to the film's surface beauty, repeated viewings reveal more annoying flaws. But Weta Workshop and the amazing cast all deserve 5-stars and more.h narrow perceptions.

B00005A1VH|5.0|This in my opinion is one of Cooper's best works, and I like it better than High Noon.  Story line does drag a bit in some beginning scenes, but has lots of action, and a great moral story line.  Too bad that this tape is hard to rent anymore for the younger generation to see what Hollywood WAS when movies had real content and social redeeming quality.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Abrams foolishly cut essential scenes despite Ryder's exquisite perfection as Spock's mom. As well, Abrams' fixation on the \\"linguistic\\" talents of Uhura is as lame and pathetic as the blotchy green-girls. Zoe Zaldana's talent deserves better than this. Every actor gave their all, and it shows. What a talented cast, from Cho to Cross, Pegg to Pine to Quinto to Ryder, Yelchin to Zaldana, and beyond to the child actors. Any faults in the film are due to the poor editing and problematic narrative flow. The cut footage (on Disk 2) should be restored and reintegrated. Currently, the story is clunky, from Kirk's childhood to Spock's. Why leave out the Klingon prison scene? Fewer shots of the boring creature chasing Kirk on the frozen planet, and inclusion of the cut scenes, would have better served the film. I'm not even going to go into the problems with Black Holes, Time Travel, and the rejection of Star Trek's time-line. The film borrows heavily from [[ASIN:B0000683DH Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], featuring the superlative Ricardo Montalban, and [[ASIN:B00005JLRT Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)]].<br /><br />On top of chopped-out scenes, military protocol is immediately disposed with. The first caption is never called by his full name: Captain Robau. He is perfectly played by the great actor Faran Tahir, who exhibits leadership and maturity. Hopefully Tahir will get many opportunities to star in many more films; same goes for Chris Hemsworth, superlative as Kirk's father.<br /><br />Of course, the music is amazing, worth more than 5 stars (had to get the soundtrack), and the closing credits are superbly done. This sensibility should have been extended throughout the film. Despite obvious flaws, there are many great scenes, and the talented actors make the limited material better. We look forward to the next installment.

B002XHN776|5.0|I think out of all the bands and artists I listen to, there's been very few bands that one can say really \\"touch\\" it's audience in more ways than one. I have been a long time 30 STM fan and as much faith as I've always had in them, I never thought they'd be able to deliver an album that packed as much of a punch as their predecessors but their deliverance of this album \\"This Is War\\" most definitely proves me wrong. I can understand why there might not be as many people on board with my opinion or the other positive congratulatory opinions of this record, but truth be told and let it be known, this album is one for the books. Every track on this album takes it's listener through a story of a man's emotions, there are admittedly tracks that will make you sad, happy, have mixed emotions and anything in between. This is the beauty of this CD. Put that in conjunction with the vast array of auditory and (imaginative) visual stimulatory beauty it produces, you've got yourself a fine piece of art to add to your collection. Another great thing I like about this CD is how Leto brings in sounds strikingly similar to that of the American composer/production group known as Tomandandy, particularly in the track, \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\". If any of you are fans of the latest Resident Evil: Afterlife OST, then you'll known exactly what I'm talking about. In the end though, this album is without question a masterpiece.
1416583408|1.0|Not an easy read at all. I got about 50pages, put this book down & picked up Born to Run.    I love dogs, enjoy learning as much as I can but for this book I do not recommend it.
B000002J5K|5.0|The Blues Brothers as Musical Theater is good entertainment; the movie was a step up from any stage performance.  For those of us who can remember John Belushi, it's a trip down memory lane.  For those who never knew him, it's prime John Belushi.  Dan Aykroyd will surprise many with excellent singing talent.  If you're considering a soundtrack from a stage performance, such as iTunes might provide: it's worth the wait.  Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and James Brown are featured in their youthful enthusiasm.  I love this collection,and recommend it highly.
0425182177|4.0|I read this book from cover to cover last year while hospitalized with \\"nothing better\\" to read....and I HIGHLY recommend \\"The Moneychangers\\" as an exciting story written in a gripping, seat-of-your-pants style.  Characters are so next-door-neighborly and you can really identify with almost all of them at some point in their progression.<br /><br />This book was written in the 1970's, yet its relevance especially in today's trying financial times will enlighten and educate anyone interested in the slightest about human psychology and the way money is so intertwined with our day-to-day lives.  The ending couldn't have been more heroic, and I am surprised Hollywood hasn't run with it and created a truly RELEVANT blockbuster.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|My 4-year old son loves this movie, I gave it to him for Valentine's Day.  He is a HUGE dog lover, and almost cried during the dog kidnapping scene.  This is sweet and does not seem too scary or in any way provocative.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|Slow-moving at times, but a gut-wrenching thriller when you realize this is no work of made-up fiction, but kind of a docu-drama on the inner workings of the BfS aka Stasi, the secret police of the so-called German Democratic Republic in reality a brutal police state.  Think Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 951 combined with renowned German efficiency (shudder).  Taking place in the early to mid-1980s, around the time Ronald Reagan was exhorting Gorbachev to \\"tear down this wall\\" in Berlin and championing the cause of freedom (remember the mainstream media in the US at the time deriding him as a \\"dangerous cowboy who should have stayed in Hollywood?\\") this is a classic case of extreme governmental/ideological self righteousness run amok.<br /><br />Even the Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht stated \\"...that the people (of the GDR) had thrown away the confidence of the government (by their many popular uprisings) and could win it back only by redoubled efforts. Would it not be easier...for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?\\"<br /><br />War crime trials a la Nuremburg SHOULD have been brought out to try the masters of evil of the ruling regime after communism's rotten core caved in 1989.  But for the sake of reconciliation--and political correctness--the evils perpetuated against ordinary citizens were glossed over and, not unlike many Nazis after WWII, the perpetuators and enablers live among the Germany of today.  Many, while no doubt sipping their lattes and driving their BMW's to their cushy government jobs, post their leftist ideological garbage on their favorite blogs--enjoying their rights and freedoms so many Americans and Germans (yes, Germans) died fighting for.
1439107955|5.0|Highly recommended for anyone interested in the history of medical science, its triumphs and wrong turns, and the personalities involved.  Mukherjee marshals a huge amount of information, and tells a complex story, without either overwhelming or condescending to the general reader.  The process of cancer genesis and development is increasingly well understood, though one would not necessarily know that by talking to practitioners.. Anyone who has had, or knows someone who has had, a cancer diagnosis (this is everyone, I think) will be grateful to Dr. Mukherjee for making this important and absorbing story available to the reading public.

Now Turner doesnt know who to trust, and his CIA handlers who were trying to bring him in have no clue as to what's going on!     Welcome to the world of the intelligence community, where compartmentalization is a necessary tool to keep secrets secret, even when the secret means mass murder of Agency personnel.

B001992NW4|5.0|Based on the 'real life' account of a thirteen-year old boy living in Mount Rainier, MD (a suburb of Washington, D.C.), The Exorcist is not only an effective horror film, but also an effective psychological tour de force.  In the movie's version of events we are taken to the more glamorous location of Georgetown, Washington, D.C. where Satan decides to possess a young girl (Linda Blair in the role as Regan). Why would Satan do this since demonic possession would prove the existence of the spiritual world, and therefore indirectly the existence of God? Well, Satan wouldn't, proving that the 'original' possession upon which the movie is based is a fraud.  To this day we still don't know the identity of the thirteen-year-old boy who was 'possessed' in 1949, which clues one into the fraudulent nature of the 'possession'. The family is said to have moved away from Mount Rainier, MD and converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism. Really? Converted to Catholicism, huh?
0312370849|5.0|I love historical fiction, and this was one of the best.  Moving back and forth from France in the 40's to France and the US in 2001 created a spell-binding story and a mystery that developed from the beginning to the end.  I read it in while traveling on business, and I barely remember the trip because the story was so engrossing.  I hated having it end -- my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough!
B0009U5DD0|3.0|I chose this CD to expand my GK collection and was disappointed.  Many of the cuts can be found on Mosaique and I wasn't moved by the others.  If you're a first-time GK listener or looking to add to your existing collection, buy Mosaique. It is an excellent representation of the remarkable work of this group.
B0036TGSJ4|2.0|I love Emma Stone.  Unfortunately, there is a lot to be desired in this effort.  The acting is too forced, as if everybody is in on the joke and trying to be funny without really succeeding.  The film is too stylish with a heightened melodramatic sense of reality.  I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief and assume this was a typical slice of adolescent life in Ojai, CA.  The costuming was too revealing and \\"high school\\" actors were far too adult to really convince me.  It works as a companion to The Scarlet Letter, but I doubt it resounds with today's teens.  Maybe if I were younger, I would get it, but it is far too tongue-in-cheek.  Believe me, I wanted to laugh out loud and ADORE this movie, but I merely giggled and was distracted by its slick presentational style.  It lacked heart--actually having to reference stronger teen films of the 80's to get its point across.  It is a great commercial for Ojai.  And Emma Stone delivers.  But just not what I expected.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Wonderful story and movie.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!  It's something anyone in the family can watch.  Clean, family movies really sell when you have a well-done story that keeps you interested and moved.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|Movie was great.  it came in a plastic wrap around the actual CD and it wouldn't play in select DVD players.  I used it for a college review in my sociology class and it was a great pick.  Awesome movie.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|Between this and my [[ASIN:B002MPPRPO Razer Naga]] the way I game on the PC has fundimentally changed. It takes a while to setup the profiles and get yourself accustomed to it but the power and flexability afforded to you by a Gameboard vs a Keyboard is unmatched.<br /><br />That being said there are some CONs:<br /><br />- The backlight colors are lacking. There are only a couple hue levels it really works with.<br />- It takes some serious getting used to. The gameboard was so awkward my first couple days.<br />- If there are no ready made profiles for your game you will have to make one and even then you might wanna customize the existing ones to your liking.<br />- The LCD is for the most part useless beyond selecting profiles & showing CPU/RAM usage. Then again I didn't buy this for a fancy LCD.<br />- Thumb positioning leaves something to be desired. Finally got used to using the lower G-key under the joystick as \\"jump\\" on FPSs but haven't really used the joypad much beyond mapping keys/macros to directions.<br /><br />Between this and my Naga however my keyboard is almost obsolete. Only ever used for messaging and not much for gaming.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars considering how much it changed the way I game but going to subtract 1 because there is room for improvement and those CONs might really turn people off.<br /><br />This product is not for everyone.<br />4 Stars.
B000MGBSI0|3.0|I did get exactly what I paid for, and I remember being addicted to this show when I was in high school and it was on TV for the first time, but I didn't like it this time around.  The storylines aren't that exciting and the characters aren't all that interesting.  However, the DVDs did arrive exactly as ordered in good condition and within the time expected, so I'm not unhappy overall.  If you're thinking of getting this, maybe wait til it's really cheap!
B0047VEE0U|4.0|I received this edition a week ago and I was really excited because is my first limited edition of a soundtrack, I bought it because I'm a big fan of Desplat's work, I believe he's one of the greatest contemporary composers for movie soundtracks and did a great job in this HP film. The delivery of this product was really soon form expected but I thought it would be heavier. I was dissapointed that the DVD only had one interview that I have already seen on youtube, I thought it would included more studio sessions or interviews with Desplat about working on the music of this film. I tried the vinyl for curiosity and again I was disappointed to find out that the tracks that the label indicates are not correct because it says Side A: Deathly Hallows that actually is Malfoy to Malfoy Manor and Side B:The Journey which I'm intrigue because there's no track called like that and actually the melody corresponds to Obliviate. Anyway, I like to have bought this edition but I found a little dissapointment because being a limited edition I expected something really really special but it's just special, however I don't regret to have spend in this item, I liked it.

0061537969|5.0|I normally am on Amazon to read reviews before I buy the books, but have never posted a review myself...but with this book I couldn't help myself. I loved it from cover to cover and would even say it's in the top 5 of my all time favorite books!
0670022411|4.0|The slow start had me worried - Diana is a historian and Matthew is a scientist, just those two tidbits should offer a clue as to how involved parts of this book were written.  I'm not into either of those subjects and found it to be a bit tedious in spots but I waded through to find a perfectly enjoyable read.  I still have no clue why I liked it so much.  I'm not a reviewer and maybe this is off base, but I wish I had a better connection to Matthew and Diana. While it revolves around them, We do get to \\"live\\" with their families for a time and that was the best part for me!  This is supposed to be a triology and I anxiously await the next tale.   Be persistent, as the book goes on, it gets better.
1594202842|4.0|[[ASIN:1594202842 Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]]    Amy Chua presents her side of her strict Chinese culture using a fun and witty approach and often making fun of herself in tense situations.

B00000G3I2|5.0|Some reviewers were negative as they found the characters unlikeable. What has that got to do with anything? If all you want are likeable characters stick with Floppsy and Moppsy. They are all very much wrapped up in themselves presenting themselves as people we wouldn't necessarily want to know. Again, what's that got to do with anything? Was it well written? Was it well cast? Did the performers hit their marks? Authors don't ask that we like all of their characters, only that, likeable or not, they are presented as believeable in regards to the world in which they, the charactors, not us, exist. The television program Dallas was a mega-hit and you'd have been hard pressed to find more that two or three charactors \\"likeable\\". How many of us can related to the world of oppulance in which they lived? Nuf said.
0385738757|3.0|Given that this is the second in a trilogy (I hope), it lacks the interesting hook that Maze Runner provided.  We already know about the Trials; we've already met the characters.  I found this tiring to read, and forced my way through it only because Dashner has me wanting to know how it ends.  The addition of another female protagonist/love interest was annoying but predictable. I find most of the characters to be unbelievable, especially Brenda.  I just don't understand how I can read two novels with the same characters and not feel anything for them; however, like I said in my review of the first novel, props to the author for an interesting plot.  I will read the third only for the big reveal; I'm so interested to see how he ties it up.  Though, I'm sure I'll be disappointed.
0802473156|4.0|I have started reading the book, but have not finished it yet. I'm a \\"newlywed\\" and I think it's going to be very helpful in my marriage.
0385737955|3.0|I love dystopian fiction, and I had high, high hopes for this book.  The plot had so much potential to deliver a great read, but the flat characters kept me from losing myself in the story.  I just didn't care about them, and the fake, forced language of the Gladers was annoying.  Props to the author for a plot line interesting enough to make me finish the book and for a surprise twist at the end that will force me to read the next in the series.

B004AQR29C|3.0|Stallone et al deliver a throwback homage to the action movie genre. Trying to rekindle some of the movie styles that have these days become post Matrix, Bourne style choppy fast camera fights and dramas, that you need to replay to enjoy.<br />The movie isn't bad, on the one hand it's totally shameless with the line up, adding Schwarzenegger and Willis to the \\"Starring\\" line up is a joke really, they are on screen for about 3 minutes of dialogue, and that's it, hardly noteworthy. Surprised they didn't have someone watching an old movie clip so they could have added \\"starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman\\" to the line up, but I digress.<br />It's a fairly simple story, the movie opens with an unconnected rescue scene to introduce us to Stallone's team of \\"Expendables\\" dealing with some Somalia pirates on a ship somewhere with hostages (very topical)plenty of gun play and action to whet the appetite so to speak.<br />We then get a deeper perspective of the main characters, particularly Stallone and Statham, as they undertake a \\"overthrow dictator and rescue innocents\\" mission in some made up island \\"in the gulf\\" - In the gulf? - which gulf, I mean come on people, details please even if it's made up.<br />Of course the mission is a lie, to aid CIA drug shenanigans, and the team have to figure out the good guys from the bad guys, and so on.<br />For me, here's where the film split, and annoyingly so.<br />If you want to make an out and out testosterone flick (the original Predator, or Rambo springs to mind) do so. Don't add in padding scenes like Mickey Rourke getting all misty eyed and introspective about old missions, and the mental and emotional cost of \\"war is hell\\".<br />Ultimately, the film tries not to be a mindless action drama, but after the meandering script dips it's toe into heartfelt character building, the movie explodes into a killing spree where just about everyone gets beaten, shot or blown up in the last 20 minutes anyway.<br />They are a few moments of levity, some tongue in cheek action sequences, and some downright good action scenes, but it felt like Stallone couldn't make up his mind between action, and a thinking mans drama, and ended up delivering neither.<br />Statham carries the whole movie for me, most of the other characters are in there for just the fighting scenes, and have little character development, but then again didn't really need any I suppose.<br />It's an OK movie, definitely worth seeing, to find out what all your friends who have seen it are chatting about, but not destined to be a classic I fancy.<br />Stallone has proved if nothing else that he's pretty good these days in the executive producers chair, maybe he should there. 3 starsction sequences, and some downright good action scenes, but it felt like Stallone couldn't make up his mind between action, and a thinking mans drama, and ended up delivering neither.

B003OCWF6I|4.0|I loved the movie. The acting is what made it. Hope they do a sequal. I think the second go around would be even better.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|An intricate story that gives life to all its characters in a way that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is a tale of love, suspense, horror, magic.. and much, much more.

0061730335|5.0|I loved this book!    First of all, listening to him recount the process of coming to understand electricity on his own was great, as was the whole story of finding parts and assembling the windmill, connecting his lights, etc. This alone would have made a good read. The second great part was the sequence about growing up in a remote agricultural village, and then his view of having lived through a devastating famine as a kid. Finally when he suddenly gets noticed by the news media, and gets invited to a TED talk in Tanzania, we get to hear about his first eye-opening experience with the outside world: Flash drives, commercial air travel, and the internet, a whole world of knowledge he never knew about, when before he was limited to what he could find in his local library.    Best book I've read in a while. I strongly recommend it.
B004DK49DW|2.0|What can I say about this album that won't upset me because for the first time I don't love an SD album. I am definitely crying on the inside a little. What I like about it, it's still SD, some songs are great, they showed yet again a bit of a different side to them. Bad, sounds more like the Rolling Stones sometimes than SD, especially with the back up singers, it's missing the edgey sound and it's much more radio friendly standard pop. Of course I love this band, I will love this band until the day I die, but waiting another 6 years for an album that sounds like they're getting a little tired is not what I want, especially since these guys are getting a little long in the tooth. I don't know maybe I'm getting a little hard on the band, but I'm afraid that this band with call it quits soon, I mean come on Mike Ness isn't getting any younger and I guess I just want every album to be amazing because you never know when it's going to be over.
0393327345|5.0|Loved this book!  Loved reading every page of it.  This is a classic and something every man should read at some point in their life.
1416583432|5.0|This book is well written and informative. I enjoyed the comments and observations the author made about her own dog. It's not a book on how to train your four legged friend. It gives you a great grasp of a dogs perception of our world. A must read if you own a dog.
B00461AIXI|5.0|I'd never heard of Bruno until I saw him perform on SNL a few month ago. I was immediately taken by his looks, style and the two songs he sang (\\"Just the Way You Are\\" and \\"Grenade\\"). I bought this CD immediately and absolutely loved it! I was struck by how many different aspects of his personality the songs reveal (assuming they're at least somewhat autobiographical). In \\"Grenade\\" he's a bitter spurned lover, in \\"Just the Way You Are\\" he's an infatuated youth, in \\"Our First Time\\" he's a tentative, romantic lover, in \\"Runaway Baby\\" he's a cynical star who can have any girl he wants and throws them aside nightly. \\"The Lazy Song\\" makes me smile every time I hear it; it's an amusing, sexy take on lollygagging. The rest of the songs are equally good; there really isn't a klunker on the whole album. Bruno's voice is prolific and endearing; he may bring to mind Michael Jackson at times but his falsetto flourishes seem less artificial then Michael's. I can't wait for his next album.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is an excellent songwriter with a rich and soulful voice to convey the emotion of each song.  The performance is excellent and the are no special effects or overproduction that we see in many contempory albums.  This album is destined to be a classic and this artist will be famous for a very long time to come.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|Probably better as a book than as a movie.  I watched this movie w/ high expectations and was somewhat disappointed.  Unless you're a computer geek, you probably found aspects of the movie difficult to follow.  Outside of Zuckerberg, the characters were pretty poorly developed.  The jock brothers were simply not believable as would-be entrepreneurs.  The pace and multi-tracked method of the Zuckerberg character's speaking got pretty annoying after a while.  I've seen it once, not need to see it again.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I loved the way the movie started out.  I thougth this is how it was in college, the clock did not matter.  The open discussions.  Then we moved to the real world.  Life is someone else's fault.  The quick thinking was good.  It was good, but maybe it was too close to life in that everything is evolving almost too quickly.  \\"What you say can be used against you\\" at any time by anyone.  It was good and a good film for creating discussions.  A good way to start off an evening of thinking, but in that regard could be scary.
0061537969|4.0|[[ASIN:0061537969 The Art of Racing in the Rain: A Novel]]<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book! I think it would also be great for male racing fans too.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Good movie.  I am not sure that reading the book didn't take away some of the story. The acting was good.  I would and have recommended this for good entertainment.  Also shows how actions can be misiterpreted by buracracies.  They \\"have\\" to find something wrong.  Well worth the cost.
B002ZG99IG|3.0|'The Roommate' is just another thrilling movie that is shown in theaters. Yes, there they have some 'jumpy' moments, but overally, it may seem a little less too boring. The plot itself is very predictable and a little bit old. *Spoiler* It was about Sara, a new college student who just moved in on her dorm, and meeting her new roommate, Rebecca. You will immediately know what Rebecca plans when you see the trailer. She wants to be Sara's friend, her VERY close friend. She overprotects her, and whatnot.   I want to give this movie four stars because of it's great bestfriends scenes, but I can't. Some roles/actors were just thrown in the movie for no apparent reasons. Like Irene and Jason.  If this DVD come out, I would definitely buy it, because, frankly, I kind of liked the movie. And if you have nothing to do on your freetime, this movie is definitely worth it!
B003XMKN40|5.0|Once again I was there at Crossroads concert it was great. This is some of the high lights of the show and is great to add to my collection of concerts.Well done and must have for fans.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Theres been a few great action movies lately, but this one is original. Everyone in it exudes character. And there was a fair balance of attention given to each character. My personal favorite was Malkovich carrying that stuffed pig around. Great action and great actors with perfect editing. It don't get no better than this.
B00006LI4S|5.0|The other live gilmour concert dvd's aren't anywhere as good. This is the best one out there so look no further. This should have been released as a live audio cd.
B002ZG99TA|1.0|Positives:   (1.) Nice train graphics - ahhh, the power of computational software.   Negatives:  (1.) Really bad script in which the writers must have spent their entire lives at Hollywood Senior High; adjacent pools and clubs. Obviously from the dialogue and human interactions they never had a blue collar working job or perhaps even seen one (except, maybe, the service industry).   (2.) Really miscast actors who must have watched old movies to figure out how to play their roles. Yes, I know what I'm talking about because I've had high school summer jobs working blue collar including a rail yard which is orders of magnitude more than either the writers or actors.   (3.) The personal interludes to, supposedly, develop the human character side of the story so that it's just not an action runaway train flick seemed plastically robotic and really badly artificially scripted. The acting was so artificial I thought I was watching plastic toys on display at KMart. The interpersonal conflicts were sooo Hollywood - desperate to create more emotion as nothing but a train on a track can get tediously wearisome.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|Original review:<br />I have this controller and it works great for me.  I'm used to the 360 controller so this works out great for me.  The only thing I do not like is that it has to use a USB slot on my PS3.  It does not bother me enough to knock it down in my rating.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/2012:<br />Updating my review to 2 stars because the controller loses connection too often to use.  The controller's design is great but I've switched back to the regular PS3 controllers since this one was losing connection in the middle of games for me and the PS3 does not automatically pause when this happens so it's kind of a killer for me.
B004EVRM7K|1.0|These companies are dumb as frak! They are continuing to fuel the chicken and egg battle between selling 3Dtv's and 3D content people want to see. Just put it all out there already! People are buying 3Dtv's, wether they know it or not, and now the most desired 3D movies are trapped in expensive bundles. Dumb dumb dumb! Panasonic. Can you say we are dumb?<br /><br />UPDATE: We will have to wait until February 2012 for general release of Avatar 3D.<br />  Un-(frakking)-beleivable
B000069AUI|4.0|The debut album Parachutes is amazing, but this was the album where Coldplay kicked in the door and said \\"we are as great as our inspirations\\". Might be true. Even Radiohead and U2 may agree. Three huge singles came from this album. \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", and the most moving of them \\"Clocks\\". My personal favorite non-single I think is \\"Warning Sign\\". I get so lost in that one. This album was so big it probably created the inevitable backlash by some fans, but's it's near impossible not to like. Afterwards I think Coldplay became the poster boys for the Adult-alternative genre. So be it.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I have one question. What became of the Gowens? They just seemed to disappear at some point. I thought that was a flaw in the script since they were so prominent, albeit a subplot, until they vanished.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Annie is the best.  The kids love it, I love it and the little girl in the movie is quite phenomenal.  We cannot start the movie by pressing play or fast play, we have to go to chapter selection and select chapter 1...still works and still an awesome movie.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Little Pretty Liars is definitely the best TV show from the history of ABC Family. I can't put it more simply.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. The author was raised a strict Catholic and still believes in God, therefore, I felt comfortable reading it.  I never felt that I was being forced to make a choice, God or aliens. Von Daniken simply lays out the facts and allows one to form their own opinions. Until I read this book, I always accepted the explanations I have been fed by so called \\"experts\\" in the fields of science and ancient archeology, etc.  I now have alternative theories to explain ancient Earth history and I found this book to be spellbinding and thought provoking.  Well worth the time and money.
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I bought this as a present for my boyfriend and he loves it, cuz he loves daft punk. I didn't really listen to it, but it's worth buying if you're a daft punk fan or you like the music in TRON.
B003UYUP58|3.0|Although I found this book to be interesting and informative, it was very hard to read. I saw the author on \\"Imus in the Morning\\" and his discription of the book made me want to read it.  However, it really takes dedication to get through. The doctor seems to forget that most of us are not medical professionals and I found myself having to reread portions to understand it. Also, it can be a very depressing read as you learn about all the different Cancers and how difficult it is to develop various treatments.  All in all, the book did not offer a lot of hope for Cancer patients and I think it would be a mistake for someone battling  the disease to read it. I do think it should be mandatory for medical professionals, especially those who deal with Cancer patients, to read. Perhaps a better understanding of the disease itself would help them to more empathetic to those who are undergoing chemo, radiation, etc. I would not recommend it for those who are just casually interested though since it reads much like a textbook at times.
159448385X|5.0|The book will leave haunting images with me that I may never forget.  Husseini writes with a deceptively simple style and effectively mixes many cultural words throughout the story.  These words have a specific meaning and application that goes beyond English and I find they give it authenticity.  The human heartache and events and circumstances beyond control elicit emphathy for many characters in a way that cuts to true, believable situations.  So many targeted groups and peoples of all cultures and ages have faced such feelings and choices--it makes for a universal understanding.  I'm not sure the entire ending keeps the tone as it appears throughout 90% of the book, but overall it was a page turner I could not put down.  It demonstrates inhumanity and a nobleness within it and I hope I now have a glipse of the Afghanistan culture and background.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele's sophomore CD \\"21\\" has been off to a phenomenal start in her native UK. She currently occupies the #1 and 4 spots on the singles and album charts, beating off Lady Gaga's over-hyped comeback single in the process.<br /><br />Adele says the lyrics were based on a break-up and this is reflected in quite a few songs. Opening the album is lead-off single \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", an upbeat soulful blast with a Motown feel, followed by the thumping Rock/Soul \\"Rumour Has It\\" (on which she sings \\"She is half your age/But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed\\").<br /><br />For those that loved her ballads \\"Hometown Glory\\" or \\"Chasing Pavements\\", there are lovely piano ballads like \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" (the latter currently the UK #1) about finding a lost love and realising he's moved on, but she wishes him well and finds it hard to move on. All the lyrics touch on matters of the heart; longing, heartache, falling in love. Her dusky soulful vocals make you yearn for more and more.<br /><br />She displays admirable diversity on the album; \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" is a sweeping enchanting ballad, \\"He Won't Go\\" a groovy midtempo soulful song that is very Lauryn Hill, \\"Take It All\\" is a Gospel-inflected piano ballad, \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" is Bluesy, \\"One And Only\\" is Country-tinged, while the album's highlight has got to be her affecting acoustic cover of The Cure's classic \\"Lovesong\\". Fantastic! Makes one look forward to 25, 30, and beyond.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was very interesting and made me want to keep reading, which a book should. I understand where people are coming frm when they say the don't like this book. That doesn't mean I agree with them. I think this book is definately worth purchsing.
B001E45XT4|2.0|The item was good -- microphone worked fine, audio worked fine. The audio was fine in quality. However, this model has broken on me time and time again. Currently using electrical tape to hold my model together until I get a new set. My brother is doing the same thing to keep his together. In the meantime, it's hanging sort of uncomfortably off my ear.
030746363X|4.0|The thing I really like about this book is that he tells you not to read the entire thing from cover to cover. There are some great tips to improve your health. The first thing I tried was the the bicep workout and I couldnt let my arms hang down straight for three days.

0307474712|4.0|I originally found this book recommended among the best of 2010, and was able to read an excerpt here on Amazon. I was immediately hooked- something about the universal relatability of that \\"one night\\" in college where everything seems different the next day spoke to me, and really made me want to follow Dex and Emma through to their conclusion. It wasn't always easy- Dexter becomes, at times, completely unlikeable, but the awkward and sometimes horrifying moments in both stories are what adds that indefinable layer of truth to the story. I wouldn't necessarily compare it to \\"Harry and Sally\\", like many of the reviewers- that is cotton candy compared to the stories told by Nicholls. Harry and Sally get wrapped up in a nice little bow, where it's never that simple with Dexter and Emma.<br /><br />Nicholls has created two characters that are truly archetypes for the modern generation: the aimless, boy-man who believes he can get by on charm alone, and the woman who refuses to settle for anything, be it jobs, men or ideals. I could really relate to Emma's journey through her 20s, feeling aimless and alone and facing imminent \\"spinsterhood\\" in the eyes of those around her.<br /><br />An emotional journey, but not without its gorgeous descriptions of London and truly humorous moments. You'll want to visit Dexter and Emma again and again.
B00008BXJF|1.0|'Happy with what you have to be happy with' is a good swipe at younger bands who lack any talent (I think Limp Bizkit especially). But that is the irony; 'Happy' is the only song on this album that is any fun to listen to... The other songs are tired, obligatory attempts by King Crimson at being, well, King Crimson.     Very formulaic It's King Crimson doing their thing, which means making sure they sound like themselves. I think it is worth noting it took a long time to make a subsequent album, maybe because their creativity well was drying up.    Except for the burst of energy that is 'Happy with what you have to be happy with', which is fun, most of this material is copy and paste of past Crimson material, e.g. 'Level 5' should be called 'Thrakcture' 'cause it simply is that, a reworking of two previous songs kind of mixed together. Rating *1/4 (1.25)
B003XU75QG|5.0|I actually bought this CD from Amazon! It is absolutely Amazing. Taylor Momsen has one of the best voices this century has seen! Her voice is breath taking! And the songs are incredible. Everyone should buy this cd if you want some good music to listen too.
B00007KWHO|3.0|You know, most bands or artists only have one 'finding themselves' album before they 'found themselves'. Now in the art of searching for oneself, I am a little confused as to how you wouldn't know where you are, but anyway... I leave that to our musicians. Some examples include Elton John, his only pre-found-himself album was 'Empty Sky'. For Genesis, it was 'From Genesis to Releation', while, for the 'Moody Blues', it was 'Go Now'. For other people like The Beatles, The Who, Van Halen, King Crimson, etc. They hit their target almost immediately, without leaving behind any little uncovered nuggets of innocence before discovering the goldmine of critical acclaim and fame. Then, there are bands, such as 'Styx' who have several albums of searching before finding that 'chord'.     However, we should feel greatly and forever blessed to have two such albums from a band called 'Yes', one of the Greatest Progressive Rock bands to ever exist. Here comes the second one, Time and a word, and that time was 1970. Come on, how cool is that? An album from Yes that is a mix of Beatlesque pop, psychedelia and prog? Backed by an orchestra? Well, it doesn't necessarily mean masterpiece, especially considering Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman weren't in the band yet, but seems kind of interesting doesn't it? And what about those other guys, Peter Banks and Tony Kaye, could they be any good, and anyway, wasn't Kaye made a millionaire by that South African popstar? 'He's my organist...' that man would go on to comment, 'then I dub my Synthesisers over the top of his organ', oh ok! Anyway, he was still there when they had 'found their sound' with 'The Yes Album'.     Well, considering all these things in mind, wasn't that description, you know, not the complete band, orchestra, hadn't found themselves, John Anderson sometimes trying to sing like Paul McCartney, occasionally trying to sing like Billie Holiday, prone to be a disaster? How could it yield any masterpieces? Well, there are a coupleof masterpieces on this record. There should be. Songs like 'Then' and the jazzy psychedelia 'Everydays', integrate the orchestra and the band very well. On some of the other tracks the orchestra is under-utilised, which is unfortunate, because at this stage the orchestra seems like their best instrumental asset. The band themselves kind of lack ideas. But some good songwriting really makes up for some uninteresting instrumental sections. And 'Sweet Dreams' is an infectious psychedelic anthem, as is the title track, both with trippy-hippie 'make love, love and more love, not war' lyrics.    Well, 'Time and a Word' is a very strange album, but it is very enjoyable, and often interesting. However, it loses momentum about two-thirds the way through, with a failed attempt at a Beatlesque ballad 'Clear Days' and the terrible vocal synthesiser on 'Astral Traveller', one song where the instrumental music is better than the song, because Tony kaye lets rip with an awesome organ solo. That said, the song has some quirky charm. 'The Prophet' is a failed prog-epic, mainly because of pedestrian instrumental sections. This song really needed more orchestra sections to make it more interesting. The bonus track 'Dear Father' is not bad, Acutally it's a good song, but sometimes the backing vocals grate quite a bit.    There is enough to be worth about 7 out of ten. Gotta pick it up for 'Everydays' and 'Sweet Dreams' and 'Then'.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Even though The Powers will award their gold trophies to last year's plays-on-film, this is truly last year's greatest film.  It is a celebration of the medium, of music, of youth, of love, of life itself.  Ignore it at your peril.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|First off, I really get into these types of stories like you see in Animal Planet's \\"I Shouldn't Be Alive\\" where a person or group of people is placed in a seemingly impossible situation to get out of, and have to somehow survive.  127 Hours is exactly this type of story and really delivers a power that will make you squirm.  Not a film you are likely to forget right away!  By the way, James Franco was terrific as pretty much the only character in the movie - a very tough role to play.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of movies that go overboard with some complex and heavy-handed storyline where you just get lost amidst all the details, and it just becomes tedious.  127 Hours just goes to show that you can tell a gripping and effective story without all the bells and whistles.  Instead, we just have here a simple story of survival, and that can sometimes make for a more entertaining experience.  Sometimes less is more.
0691142165|5.0|In this very useful book, authors Carmen Reinhart, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, and Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard University, present the findings of decades of research into economic crises.<br /><br />Their title refers to the recurring belief that we are now too smart to have crises: this time is different. Before every crisis, governments, financiers, bankers and pundits promise that this time we really have reached the end of crises, of history, etc. For example, in April 2007, the International Monetary Fund told us that the risks to the global economy were extremely low.<br /><br />The authors show that repeated sovereign default on external debts is the norm throughout every region of the world since the birth of capitalism. Defaults peaked in the wars against Napoleon, the 1820s-1840s, the 1870s-1890s, the 1930s-1950s and the 1980s-1990s. There were lulls in 1890-1914 and 2003-8. 1947 was the peak of the largest default in modern history, when countries representing 40 per cent of world GDP were in default or rescheduling.<br /><br />Serial default is the norm. Since 1800, there have been 70 defaults on domestic public debt. Britain defaulted in 1749, 1822, 1834, 1888-89 and 1932 by converting debt into lower coupon rates. The USA defaulted in 1933 by abrogating the gold clause, to reinflate its economy through expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. Other countries have defaulted by inflation.<br /><br />Serial banking crises are also the norm. De-regulation encourages high international capital mobility, which repeatedly produces international banking crises. These crises drag down economic growth and are contagious.<br /><br />The authors show that after crises, house prices fall by 35 per cent on average, for 6 years; unemployment rises by 7 per cent for 5 years (in the Great Depression, by 16.8 per cent); GDP falls by 9 per cent for 2 years (in the Great Depression, for 4 years); it takes 4.5 years for output to reach its pre-crisis level (after the Great Depression, 10 years); and average government debt rises by 86 per cent after 3 years. As they point out, \\"the biggest driver of debt increases is the inevitable collapse in tax revenues that governments suffer in the wake of deep and prolonged output contractions.\\"output to reach its pre-crisis level (after the Great Depression, 10 years); and average government debt rises by 86 per cent after 3 years.

0812550706|1.0|I picked up the Ender Quartet a while back because I was looking for something different to read, and the plot synopsis on the back of the books sounded pretty interesting, so I took the plunge and bought the paperback set.  After reading Ender's Game, and about the first half of Speaker for the Dead, I simply could not get into the series.  Without playing spoiler, Ender's Game seemed to just be a few hundred pages of training drills (with a couple of side stories) which I found pretty tedious overall, except with a reasonable explanation at the end for what was really happening.  So I got to the end of Ender's Game and was thinking \\"Ok, that was clever, but man it was a dull ride getting here.\\"  I found the first 1/3 to 1/2 of Speaker for the Dead to be more or less the same thing - tedious and wordy.  Maybe it was just the author's writing style, but I frankly found these books to be pretty boring and couldn't wait to put it down and start reading something else.  There are over 2000 people reviewing here that disagree with me, so clearly I am in the minority - try it and judge for yourselves.  I tried to give the Ender Quartet a chance, but I just wasn't getting reeled in at all so I gave up and moved on to something else.  It wasn't for me.

B000000SHJ|5.0|These performances which I have been playing for years, all the time, are really like the painter's great works. Like the unearthly shine on the pearl earrings in Vermeer's famous painting  these readings really have a deep shine or sheen that delights. This quality is so great and notable that the distance between them and other quartets that sought caverns of meaning in the works vanishes. I just love them. Beauty is strangely  skin deep, but only in hands of geniuses.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this new album by Adele.  She is twenty-two, but the way she conveys a wisdom far beyond her years when she sings.My favorite track is \\"One and Only\\".  This is a soulful love song that touches me personally.  I yearn for a love that Adele describes on this song \\"Turning Tables\\" is a song about a conflict between two people.  This song is about trying not to get hurt emotionally.  The piano playing sounds good on this track.  \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" and \\"Rumor Has It\\" are two tracks with an excellent drum beat.  These songs are good songs to move to.  Adele covers the classic song \\"Lovesong\\". The guitar playing is beautiful on this track. Adele's vocals are very soothing on this song.  \\"He Won't Go\\" is a smooth groove jam of a song.  \\"Someone Like You\\" is a song about trying move after breaking up with someone.  This song has a positive spirit about relationships.  There is a maturity in Adele's voice.  It comes through clearly on this track. \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\" is a song with a dramatic quality. I like the image of fire and rain this song creates in my mind.  I like the sentiment of the song \\"Do You Remember\\".  This song makes me reflect on the women I used to have feelings for. I enjoy the music on this album very much.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Hard to believe this is the beginning of the end for this series. But what a way to go out! As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I was utterly dissapointed at the last two films. They strayed so far from the source material, I was quite honestly shocked and truly feared for the rest of he series. Well, I am pleased to say that Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is near perfection. High praise, yes, but I truly felt it did the book (at least the first part) justice. People have been complaining that not much happens and it is very slow-moving. Well, yes it is, but again, that is not so different from the book. The first part is a journey and sort of a teaser for the grand finale. Though not much action occurs, it is still quite interesting and truly suspensful. Especially if you've never read the books(which is just astonishing to me since they are a million times better than the movies).     The characters are so grown up now and with that comes so much more emotion, and drama. The Half-Blood Prince contained too much humour, I thought. But Deathly Hallows Pt.1 contains just the right amount of everything. All the actors do an incredible job, even Dan Radcliffe, who I've always seen as the weakest link in the series. He's truly developed as an actor and did a wonderful job here. You can really feel the struggle these characters are going through on their journey.  It is just Harry, Ron and Hermione alone in the wilderness, trying to keep some sort of composure during their grim endevor. I do have to say one thing though: My favorite character in the series, Severus Snape, has literally one scene. I was extrememly dismayed but can only hope for more in the second part. Even with that one scene, he steals the show.     The imagery is fantastic, the musical score is just right, the cinematography is first-rate. Aside from a couple of odd scenes, which were not in the book, I could really find nothing to complain about. I'm glad they decided to split the book, I think it was the best decision for this film and the entire series.
B004D0YB4Y|4.0|Another fantastic entry in the Daptone/Dunham catalog, and this time it's Charles   Bradley's time to shine, backed up by Dap-Kings guitarist Brenneck and his   supersoulsolid Menahan Street Band.     A voice doesn't come much rawer than Bradley's. The man has definite soul power,   sometimes he hits like a roll of thunder, and it's easy to understand that he   once fronted a James Brown tribute band. The man sure can holler!     In the end I think it sounds a bit too similar to get top honours, and maybe   The Menahan Street band could have taken a more adventurous approach to   some of the songs, but that is a negligible complaint, as you will find a lot   of truly great songs on it.     Standouts: the soul classic The World Is Going Up In Flames, I Believe In   Your Love(with sweet horn stabs, and backing vocals from The Gospel Queens),   No Time For Dreaming, the truly amazing How Long and the album closer,   Heartaches And Pain, a sad, autobiographical tale about a family member   killing his brother.     Put in in the basket. Payday is long overdue for Charles Bradley. Amazon should   even charge you over prize for this one, so we can be assured the man drive   according to his class, in a golden limo soulsmobile.

1439156816|5.0|First, let me say that I am not a fan of Stephen King's horror stories. At least, I'm not a fan any more. I was a fan when I was aged 14, when I read a dozen of his novels. Then I grew out of King's stuff pretty fast, and moved on to what the snobs call \\"literature\\".<br /><br />Now I'm 42. I like literature very much indeed, and I don't think I could bear to read one of Stephen King's horror stories. I've also just finished writing my first novel - all 300 pages worth. And I don't think I could have done it without Stephen King's help.<br /><br />I read (or rather listened to, because I have the audiobook version) this book not because King is good, because I really don't think his novels are that good, but because he is successful. You can't sell 100 gazillion novels without knowing a few tricks. And it was those tricks that I wanted to add to my armoury. You see, I had tried to write a novel before, and I had failed. I failed because I didn't know what the hell I was doing.<br /><br />I succeeded after listening to King's On Writing because his advice prompted me to forget all about my plot and carefully constructed storyline and concentrate instead on my characters, and on the situations they found themselves in. Most of all, King's advice encouraged me to treat each scene or episode as an individual short story.<br /><br />On Writing contains tonnes (that's tons, if you're American) of useful advice for the aspiring writer, no matter how lofty his or her ambitions.<br /><br />However, it also contains a bunch of autobiographical stuff that really isn't all that interesting unless you are a major Stephen King fan.<br /><br />I am not a Stephen King fan, but I found that I had no choice but to wade through the autobiographical stuff so that I could pick out all the useful tips.<br /><br />In short, I recommend this book if you are an aspiring writer, or if you are an obsessive Stephen King fan. Just be aware that you will probably only enjoy half of what you are reading (unless you are both an aspiring writer and an obsessive Stephen King fan, in which case you will dribble on yourself).<br /><br />Thank you for your advice, Stephen King.<br /><br />Now, if only I could find the motivation to tackle my second draft...sessive Stephen King fan, in which case you will dribble on yourself).

B000W7JWUA|4.0|This game is fun and keeps you thinking. I also bought the 5-6 player extension in order for more players. The only thing I would change is for there to be a set of instructions included with the game to make it a 2 player game. Our family played this over and over the first week we received it. It is a cross between Monopoly and Risk. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy game play.

I don't want to spoil the story, but think... who was the kidnapper?... How does he take care of his victims?...How can a mother raise her child in one room?... Do they escape?  I would recommend this book to anyone.

Then the language started.  I'm sorry, this may be a great book, but I will never know.  I will not listen nor read such language.  There are way too many adjectives that can be used to express oneself.  This review is only for those who are offended by explicit language.  As state before, this book may be fantastic, I for one will never know.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see this movie in a recent newsletter and was very keen to purchase after so many positive reviews. This is a film not just about Secretariat but of his owner Penny Chenery Tweedy, who takes over her ailing father's Meadow stables, played brilliantly by Diane Lane. John Malkovich was also outstanding as trainer Lucien Laurin. Critics will argue about some of the facts and the direction this movie takes towards his owner, but make no mistake this is a truly enjoyable film and one that the whole family will enjoy. The race scenes were well done, however if there is minor complaint about this film it is his win in the Belmont Stakes by 31 lengths. It was building up well until they went into slow motion with the horse entering the straight and the crowd looking more in awe than cheering, which is not what it was really like. It left me a little deflated and took away the excitement at that point. That aside the extras on the DVD are excellent with real footage of his Triple Crown wins, commentary from the people associated with this great horse, including Diane Lane, John Malkovich, Penny Chenery Tweedy, the other cast members and journalists reporting on this great horse. This is a feel good movie with moments of sadness and many exhilarating moments. I highly recommend this movie.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This show simply has the best story, best writing, best cinematography, and best acting of any show that's ever been produced. So far, in its three seasons, it has continued to wow me. And the second season is probably the best season. The extra features are awesome as well. There's a writer's room featurette that gives some insight into the writing process of the show. And really, there's just a lot of special features. Definitely worth buying on Blu-Ray.
0307474275|5.0|This was one very famous, very interesting book and movie. I am not sure why people forgot all that. It is like roller coaster where you enjoy so much but the fun is not sustaining. Lot of people have been debating about facts in the book, I will say if the intention was facts then it would not have been popular but rather utterly boring book. Most of us know quite well how many hoops we have to go to make our kids read religious books if Bible/Quran are factual. Dan wrote in a very interesting way some pretty nice mind teasers and it gets pretty high marks on that scale. If you enjoy challanging yourself outside work then this book is a must read.
B0012GMUZY|5.0|All the songs get me in a good mood, even Stackolee, which is actually a quite violent song. I love this collection of songs.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|This is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums to date. It is a different version of early Yanni but with a lot more production. None of the orchestration of Acropolis and Tribute but not as mellow as his earlier works. It took a few listens for it to grow on me and I'm still not fond of the vocal ones, but to LOVE 12 of 15 tracks still makes this album a great buy and a joy to own.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|\\"Brothers,\\" by the Black Keys, is a dark and gritty album. There are plenty of good songs, and this is a good album, but sometimes this album does get a little bit inconsistent. I do suggest buying it, though.
B004DTLK8A|5.0|This album is amazing!  It's classic Stratovarius at their best.  They have perfected the Power Metal genre, and this album shows it.  Better than \\"Polaris\\" and it may be their best album yet.  Amazing from start to finish!
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Disney has produce another wonderful family movie! If you love horses you will love this one! This true store shows how courage and determination of a smart Virginia woman doesn't let a man's world in the horse racing world discourage her to race her horse she has total faith in! The camera gives you the amazing  feeling you are in the race and riding on the horse. This movie is worth buying!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is such a GREAT DVD of one of the best guitar players in the world!  You know how on music videos the camera shots are only 3 seconds max, well not so here.  It is like being at the concert, when there are drum riffs the camera is there just as you would look at the drums when you heard the riffs.  Great songs, well done, and well produced.  Very happy I bought it!

0060531053|5.0|This book is excellent! It is like the Bible for Home Brewers....i.e., it is to brewers what the Joy of Cooking is to home chefs; it provides all the basic information that you need to understand what you are doing in the kitchen, whether it is brewing up a batch or simply imbibing someone else's tasty product.    If you have an interest in beer, not just brewing, this book can help provide you with a lot of practical information. I have read several other brewing books and none of them are quite as useful as this one is. This author and this particular work are often mentioned in the other brewing books, which goes to show why this is the best place to start if you want to simply learn more about beer.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It takes a lot for me to 'dislike' a book. Usually I just won't finish but the first two in the series were amazing. I really wanted to see how this would end. I wish I could turn back time. I actually had nightmares because of this book! There were things in this book that were more disturbing than even Stephen King has come up with. I actually felt sick to my stomach and questioned the author's sanity at times.   While the author's writing is stunning, for that I give it a two, but I can't look past the gruesome and disgusting elements. It's like she took sick pleasure in killing her beautiful characters in a horrific fashion.   I don't know, this one is going to stick with me way to long and not in a good way.  :c
0316010669|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure I am a huge Malcolm Gladwell fan and thoroughly enjoy the way he presents and supports his theses. In \\"Blink\\" Gladwell seeks to show us how our subconscious effects our snap judgments and gut instincts. I really enjoyed the book, and thought the manner in which the evidence was presented was fluid. The book is a very easy read and I found it affected the way that I went about my own decision making and personal interactions on a daily basis. For readers who enjoy books that make you think, Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is a must read!

0802136834|5.0|I did manage to read a lot in between coughing fits and naps. I finished Alison Weir's The Six Wives of Henry VIII. My sister-in-law sent me a copy of this book almost a year ago and I've been trying to fit it into my reading schedule since then. My college roommates and I decided to read it this month for our long distance book club.<br /><br />I was fairly familiar with the story of King Henry VIII's second wife Anne Boleyn, although mostly the tabloid-style rumors associated with her rise and fall. The history and stories surrounding the other five wives were new to me. Weir's history makes it accessible. It is fascinating and bizarre.<br /><br />Alison Weir writes well. The book is entirely readable and in fact, I had trouble putting it down. Weir conducted in-depth research of her topic and discounts rumors when the evidence simply doesn't add up. She has a deep understanding of the period and grasps the political, religious and social reasons behind King Henry's frequent amours and intrigues.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book so much that I ordered Weir's The Children of Henry VIII before I had read 200 pages of the first. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in English history.

B001BZGA8Y|5.0|I got this as a Father's Day present from my wife last year.  First of all, let me just say that this watch looks fantastic on.  I have gotten numerous complements on it....People are often surprised when they find it it is a Swatch...this is not the toy type Swatches from the 80s....this is a great-looking and well made watch.  The links (including the end links) are solid and that gives the watch a nice \\"heft\\" to it.  The white looks great.  You can wear it with almost any color, though I prefer it with lighter hues.  The \\"crystals\\" around the dial are subdued enough to make it look classy and not gaudy.  What more can I say.  It looks great, feels great, and I love it.
0823003035|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who's an excellent artist.  She loved the book and the advanced techniques it describes in the later chapters.  She believes it's an excellent guide to learning techniques and specific art rules that lead to a much more detailed and proportional drawing.  She very highly recommends this for beginner to advanced artist since the techniques are so well explained and drawn for easy reference.

0525423273|5.0|What a ridiculously fun ride ANNA is! This is not your average romance, and it's a great example of YA Contemporary writing elements all coming together in a perfect way.<br /><br />First line: \\"Here is everything I know about France: Madeline and Amelie and Moulin Rouge.\\"<br /><br />Synopsis: Anna is looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. Which is why she is less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris - until she meets Etienne St. Clair: perfect, Parisian (and English and American, which makes for a swoon-worthy accent), and utterly irresistible. The only problem is that he's taken, and Anna might be, too, if anything comes of her almost-relationship back home. As winter melts into spring, will a year of romantic near - misses end with the French kiss Anna - and readers - have long awaited?<br /><br />Review: I really enjoyed the experience that is ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS by Stephanie Perkins. It is a clever, entertaining ride that I truly did not want to end. The pacing is fast without being breakneck and the romance is developed in a realistic, controlled, yet exciting way. This is also a lot due to the character development that is spot-on and allows you to fall in love with Anna and (of course) her mysterious American/British/French hotness, St. Clair.<br />Anna is your typical girl next door yet she's so much more than that. Throwing the main protagonist into an unfamiliar setting will show you the depth of their soul pretty quickly. Here we not only threw Anna into a new setting, but it's an entirely new country! Luckily Anna rolls with it and is independent, spunky, self-conscious and a lot like someone you know. But Stephanie didn't stop there as there's an entire cast of fantastic characters that surrounds Anna. They are all charming yet relatable and you find yourself laughing, cheering, screaming, flirting, crying, all right along with them. By far the biggest surprise for me was getting to know the other under-the-radar main character of the book: Paris, France. I was never overly interested in this city before, but experiencing her wonder and beauty through Anna's eyes opened up a whole new world.<br /><br />ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is one of my favorite novels of 2010-2011, and I'm truly looking forward to Stephanie's next book LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR. *5 Kindle Hugs*iggest surprise for me was getting to know the other under-the-radar main character of the book: Paris, France.

0345528581|5.0|I honestly regret I hadn't bought this book before I spent $2.5k on exercise equipment. The exercise program described in this book takes 4 half-hour workouts per week and requires (1) you, (2) the book, and (3) some household props. Sneakers recommended, but that's about it, because even street clothes will do. For someone like me, very active overall but with mediocre upper body strength, this book is simply wonderful. I started noticing the difference after merely two weeks of workouts: my arms got stronger, muscles became more pronounced, and I started looking more tone all around. I definitely feel this workout has had more impact on my physique than aerobic exercise, which is already a part of my life. If you buy the book, read it with understanding, and actually do the workouts, you can expect great results. I'm working on mine now.
B003EYVXXW|1.0|Rather than trying to learn about history from movies or TV shows, perhaps we should study history books written by scholars and ancient contemporaries.  We would then discover that Theophilus did not call for the destruction of a library but of centers of idol worship.  The Alexandrian \\"library\\" did not at that time contain any scrolls--they had all been destroyed centuries earlier (either before Christianity existed or while it was still a small, illegal sect). The last remaining great library of the ancient world was preserved by the Christians in Byzantia (Constantinople).  Although we would all like to blame the Christians for the sunset of a golden age of reason, fires were the great destroyers of ancient libraries.  That, however, doesn't make for very interesting movies. Also some of the other \\"reviewers\\" should remember not to judge a faith when some of it's followers do something bad.  It's like blaming Buddha for Pearl Harbor.  That would be reasonable if religious adherents always acted in perfect conformity with the teachings of their founders.  Unfortunately, they do not.

0896898288|1.0|Although the quilt itself is gorgeous, the designer offers no guidance, whatsoever, with the individual blocks.  From outward appearances, the blocks look easy.  I must say that 90% of the difficulty in this quilt is cutting out the individual pieces from templates.  This is where you will run into hassles.  She gives no assistance with tracing the templates onto the fabric.  This was my first time making a quilt from templates (I usually use a rotary cutter for all of my pieces) and it would have been nice to be told UP FRONT what side of the fabric to trace on.  The cd leaves a lot to be desired.  Mine was missing some of the templates and after playing several rounds of useless phone tag with Krause Publications I gave up and had to borrow some of my missing templates from another lady who is also making this quilt.  I think what irritates me the most is that I made a couple of attempts to contact the designer.  Either she didn't get my emails, or I was ignored.  I don't know the answer to this one.  I do know that in all of my years of quilting I have NEVER had a problem with writing to the designer of a pattern to get some clarification.  If people like Eleanor Burns, Carol Doak, and Alex Anderson can write me back within the third day after I write them, you would think this lady could do the same.  Needless to say, I won't be buying into another one of her projects.

B0034G4OZO|4.0|Directing team Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden burst onto the indie scene a couple years ago with the incredibly dreary but amazingly disarming Half-Nelson, in which a basehead Ryan Gosling showed himself as an actor of incredible, incredible talent, allowing more jaded moviegoers to forgive him for The Notebook. Now, some four or five years later, they have given the same opportunity to Zack Galifinakis, allowing him to stretch his acting chops in the shoes of a mental patient. While the result is not quite as heart-rending as Half-Nelson, It's Kind of A Funny Story is enjoyable in a different way. It is a light, entertaining coming of age story with a brisk pace and good message. Sometimes that is all a film needs.  With such morbid offerings in Hollywood these days (Black Swan, Let me In, Winter's Bone, et al), it is nice to find a film that nurtures its characters, allows them a chance to branch out, but provides them with *spoiler* a reasonably happy ending.   The film is about a teen who finds himself somewhat suicidal with a family who are well-meaning but don't quite have enough time for him so he checks himself into a mental hospital and befriends both an older patient and a troubled girl his own age. Zack G. shines in the mentor role. Unlike the Hangover, he doesn't feel like he is just using random bits from his stand-up routine. His character is rounded and believable. The main kid does a great job. His eyes are dark and full of the sort of angst that most teens come to hate at times, feeling lost and that life is a pointless exercise. The girl is also believable as an indie chick with some pain up her sleeve, even if the cause of her trouble is never fully explained.   The film is a far far lighter endeavor than both Girl, Interrupted or Milos Forman's classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There are a lot of scenes of positive reinforcement and dealing with issues in a constructive manner. One meltdown aside, the film portrays its subjects as virtually across-the-board endearing, perhaps a little too much so. Gone are the shuffling catatonics of Cuckoo's Nest (Men David Foster Wallace might call \\"crocodiles\\"). Absent are the eerie-eyed beauties of Girl, Interrupted who have sacrificed everything and will continue catapulting toward the abyss until a heavy shot in the arm silences them. Fleck and Boden's film is different. Perhaps it speaks to the way the mental treatment business has undergone some long-awaited improvements in the past few decades. Perhaps it is only wearing rosy-tinted glasses.  Regardless, the film remains respectful of those with mental disorders, reiterating for perhaps not so savvy audience members that diseases of the brain are nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed by. Dealing with this stigma is laudable and so is showing problems as conquerable- and not in a Nurse Ratchet manner. Hope is a precious commodity in Hollywood these days. If it comes in a David Bowie dance number or clandestine jaunts through the hospital in promoted scrubs, so be it. There is room for a life lesson or two that avoid saccharine by a few steps and a love story that is so cleverly self-referencial to avoid running aground on cliche.   For anyone looking an accompaniment to Renton's \\"choose life\\" speech at the end of Trainspotting (albiet a lot lighter), this film will satisfy. It will leave you feeling good. Released. Sometimes that is all a movie needs to do to be memorable. To make you feel worthy, human and very much alive.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|I must have gotten a bootleg copy of this documentary.  The sound quality was horrible; we could not understand what Al Gore was saying.  Poor quality taping as well.  I would not recommend buying this product.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|Of the movie I must say that it is a powerful and engaging drama.  The acting is top notch, as is the direction and cinematography. I walked away from this film in deep thought and have pondered the moral implications of the dilemma presented.  I did find that the actions (and underlying motivations) of both the younger and older Michael Berg a bit wanting.  One has to put some guess work into it, and though others have credibly filled in the gaps, I felt the film did not substantiate to this degree; thus I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Still, it is a movie I highly recommend seeing, and will generally give it rave reviews.

B00275EHJG|1.0|I love the first 2 movies, but this one was so depressing for me. Why did they so badly want to get back to Andy? So they could sit in the attic? It's not like the first 2 movies where they are trying to get back to Andy to be played with. It was just reallyyyyyyyyy sad. The incinerator scene was uncalled for and I can't believe they thought that was a good idea. All the toys holding hands accepting the fact that they are about to burn up........ugh, no, this is a kids movie. I also didn't like the outcome of Lots O Huggin bear. Why couldn't he turn into a nice bear? His story was SO sad and I don't think he deserved to be strapped to the front of a truck at the end. And then at the end Andy gives away his beloved toys to some random girl. UGH. I HATED it. Where is the magic, Pixar? Also don't talk to me about how this is the \\"real world\\" and people give away their toys ect...... have you SEEN the movies? They are toys that come alive for Christs sakes. I wanted a happy story like the first 2.
B003QCCS36|3.0|It is an enjoyable CD to listen to for background music.  However listen to the words more closely and you have to cringe a little as Mr. Lamontagne drops cliche after cliche in his lyrics.  Being a fan of his previous CDs I was disappointed by his wordsmithing on God Willin'.  Seems like his lyrical mind went blank while his melody mind was pumping out material.  But if you play it as background and hum along it works, just don't start singing along or you're likely to be disappointed.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Amazon is stating in the films' specs that the STAR WARS blu ray releases will be in an Aspect Ratio of 1.33:1. This has to be a mistake doesn't it? The original films as well as earlier DVD releases were in the much, much wider (and correct) cinemascope 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio. What gives?    I certainly am not buying these discs until I know the films are being released in the original, correct 2.35:1 ratio.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm really skeptical when it comes to fitness video, but after I read all of the positive reviews, I thought I'd give this one a try. [...]. I wouldn't say I'm in really great shape, but I can definitely hold my own in the gym. This. Was. HARD. I would definitely recommend doing the levels as instructed (start out with 1, and get up to 3 when ready) but if you're already pretty fit, go ahead and mix it up so you aren't doing the same routine over and over for weeks on end.<br /><br />I've done this every single day for two weeks and I definitely feel different. My pants are a bit loose, and I'm feeling much stronger. I'm going to continue for the next two weeks to do the full \\"30-day shred\\".<br /><br />It only takes 20 minutes to do each segment which makes this perfect for people who are really busy, or who hate working out. The price is right, and you can even watch it \\"on demand\\" while you're waiting for the hard copy to arrive.

B004E3XD1W|3.0|Okay, just hear me out on this. I know you guys love this book. And I understand why. Strong female hero. Really neat premise of these people who are born with a special grace but are shunned and not praised because of it. Kingdoms at peaceful but somewhat cold war distance from one another. Intrigue at the political level which gets personal when our girl meets her mate and his grandfather. And then to have them make decisions slightly outside of our cultural norm, with solid reasoning -- whether you agree or disagree -- that's thought out and explained well. This has all the makings of a fantastic book.    However, there's an issue I had pretty early on, and it's unfortunately an issue that wouldn't stop nagging at me as I read. The heroine was nearly invincible, and she was never in imminent danger for very long at one time. It was hard to feel truly worried about her or anything she was involved in.    Was she bitterly torn by her inner need to rebel against her uncle and her upbringing to obey? Sure. But that problem gets dispatched pretty early on. She has tons of moral and familial and friendly support for her decision. And there is no reckoning for her decision. And then, unfortunately, everything in the book follows this same pattern. A problem is presented, but one needn't worry. The issue is resolved within a page or two. The damage, if any, is made livable. Everyone the reader cares about eventually agrees on what happened. Everything is okay. Next problem. And so on.    For me, the writing was a bit bland, as well. I felt like we were in Katsa's head too much, and the themes, the worries, and the decisions got repetitive.     I wish I could give this book a 2.5 star review. There was a lot to like, potentially, but it just didn't quite make it there for me.
B003B30GSY|5.0|Still, following more than nine months after the release of this very good, bordering on excellent Schumann bicentennial commemorative box set, I cannot believe that someone from Amazon's deep and wide pool of classical music reviewers and olympic sized stable of classical fans has not reviewed the release.  That is disappointing, and it might be due to the almost simultaneous release of the DG MASTERWORKS 35 disc box set,which in some AMAZON MARKETPLACE circles was scarfed up by the saavy price conscious classical collector for about the same price for ten discs of additional Schumann material above and beyond this set.  In a sense, the comparison between the two sets makes this one pricey, or at least pricier, but it is still a considerable bargain at about two dollars a disc.  I would point out a caveat that there is considerable duplication if one were to purchase both this SONY set and the DG set.<br /><br />I include the caption as well as timings from another website on the subject herein:<br /><br />\\"Commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Robert Schumann, Sony Classical has issued a limited edition 25 CD box set drawn from outstanding performances in the Sony catalog.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|There are over 700 reviews to this so I'll keep it short. I bought the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />Great movie. If you loved the game, you should love the movie. It was great to see the characters come to life in the movie. The game was such a classic but there was no voice acting in the game. I have to say that they made each character exactly they way I pictured they would be. From the voices to the interactions, to the story. It's amazing. The blu-ray version is longer and well worth the extra time. It even explains some of the back story from FFVII so it does help for people that haven't played the game. It actually combines all three versions of the film to one - hence the name Advent Child Complete. It's the final version of the movie.<br /><br />The movie did do good in sales. It was the #1 best-selling Japanese anime movie in North America in 2006 and it won best anime feature at the American Anime Awards in 2007. If you own the original DVD, I would highly recommend you get the blu-ray version.<br /><br />If you have seen spirits within and not played the game, then you might not get the movie. I would only suggest to everyone that gave this a 1 or 2 star review to play the game or buy the blu-ray version that has a lot of the back story. If you are planning to buy this just because you saw spirits within, I would not recommend it until you play the original FFVII game. You won't appreciate the characters, the story, the interactions, the feelings, etc. until you have been through the game.<br /><br />IMO, buying this movie and giving it a bad review without ever playing the game doesn't make sense. It's like buying the blu-ray version without owning a blu-ray player. It just doesn't make sense. It's like saying Chewbacca lives on Endor with the Ewoks. Why would an 8 foot tall Wookie live on a planet with 3 foot tall Ewoks? It just doesn't make sense. I know I just used the wookie defense from Southpark but I hope you get the point.<br /><br />If you have a PS3, you can buy or download the original game and play through it (Yes PS1 games will play on PS3) or it's on the PSP. Do everyone a favor and play the game first before seeing this movie and giving it a bad review!al game and play through it (Yes PS1 games will play on PS3) or it's on the PSP. Do everyone a favor and play the game first before seeing this movie and giving it a bad review!
B000IZA9PI|1.0|There is a theory amongst trekkies that Even films are Good and Odd films are Bad. Although true of all the other films, this rule breaks down with this film, which is devoid of any of the brilliant writing of [[ASIN:6305127638 First Contact]], and lacks even the more mediocre writing of [[ASIN:B000AOEMXM Enterprise]].<br /><br />This movie is filled with plot holes, cliche's and lazy sloppy writing - all the things that I never thought Star Trek would sink to. To start with, there is that 'happy families' scene at the start on the holodeck, followed by the contrived 'buggy racing' scene (just because they haven't done it before) and then there is the whole plot with Shinzon, which is desperately trying to be a 'devil twin' thing, but fails completely.<br /><br />Overall, this film is so dreadful that I have thrown in the towel and joined the 'dark side'. Yes, that's right - I now believe that [[ASIN:B000FQJAJG Star Wars]] would win the battle against Trek not through weaponry or tactics, but through sheer relative Charisma (even with Anakin in tow - how uncharismatic can you get?)<br /><br />As an interesting footnote to this film, isn't it interesting that the phrase 'grow a beard' meets its counterpoint in this film, when Riker shaves it off? If growing a beard is associated with TV series suddenly getting much better (based on Riker growing a beard in series 2) then I find it deeply ironic that, when Riker shaves off his beard in this film, Nemesis turns from an initially promising film to the pile of tripe it has become!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I love this movie! It was so cute. My daughter loves it. She never gets tired of seeing it, and I have to admit I love seeing it too.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|One thing that can be disappointing about B-movies/ Alternative movies is their lack of budget. Not so with this film as its makers apparently spent $47 million - the type of figure that Kevin Smith would have killed for with [[ASIN:B002LMOCJ0 Clerks]] - only for the distributor to drop the film leading to US box office takings of just $60,000.<br /><br />Bad news for the Producers, but good news for alternative movie fans as this is now a movie with a B-movie plot but an A-movie budget!<br /><br />Watching the film it is a little hard to work out how such a film got such financing. In content, it is similar to [[ASIN:B002CLBJVO The 13th Warrior]] in being a good movie with good acting, dialogue, etc but with a plot set in an obscure location that would be unlikely to make it a box-office smash (Norway, anyone?)<br /><br />But if you're tired of watching the identikit action movies produced by Hollywood, then this is at least refreshingly different. The main character is a space traveller who is marooned on planet Earth in 7th Century Norway. Rather like [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien]], he's brought something rather unpleasant with him in the form of a 'Moorwen' which proceeds to kill the local population.<br /><br />Starring Jim Caviezel & John Hurt, the acting is convincing & seamless. Although the plot is a little predictable (despite its unusual setting), it does still keep your attention & provide the odd surprise.<br /><br />So, if you've come across this film in a quest to find something new to watch then it provides something a little different to either trashy B-movies or slick A-movies, falling somewhere between the two. Maybe not the greatest film in the World, it is still worth a watch when the missus is away...
1400079276|5.0|Murakami has the ability to thread his stories through with sadness, realism, beauty, and the absurd. Kafka On The Shore is no exception. This book quickly became my favorite of what I've read so far. Like the others, it did take some time for me to get into the story, but once I'm hooked I finish it in no time. Because he has many characters, concepts and storylines to introduce, the start will likely be a slow one for many who choose to read it.    A departure from his typically middle-aged male protagonist, the story is told mainly from Kafka Tamura's perspective. He is a 15 year old runaway battling an impending Oedipal fate. The story splits into alternating chapter storylines (a pattern Murakami seems to follow in some of his works) and we are introduced to an older, off-kilter character of Mr. Nakata. He is likeable and strange. He brings much of the surrealism early on in the story. Kafka manages to do the rest toward the end of the book. I love his style of alternating the parallel stories. As in Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, you know the paths will end up somehow intersecting. If not in a very distant but meaningful way.    One of my favorite things about reading Murakami are the very poignant and sometimes heart-wrenching passages. \\"Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.\\" or \\"There's only one kind of happiness, but misfortune comes in all shapes and sizes. It's like Tolstoy said. Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness is a story.\\"
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I absolutely love the music from this soundtrack! It takes me back to when I saw the movie and was blown away. The movie was great and I love being able to listen to all of the songs whenever I want. Sometimes it is all that I will listen to for days in the car!! Can't wait for the movie - only a few more days!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|OMG!  This is a great CD!  I have been waiting on this album since \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" was released and it doesn't disappoint.  Adele is awesome!
B000FGGE68|4.0|You'll have to leave your sense of credulity in the kitchen cabinet before watching this film.  It follows rather closely in the style of Aeon Flux, where insurmountable odds are a mere nuisance.  Milla Jovovich (as if born for action films) does a terrific job as a seemingly unbeatable lethal force.  The staging and choreography are well done.  This is worth a viewing by sci fi/fantasy admirers.  The cinematography alone and the mesmerising gaze of Milla Jovovich should be enough to keep you entertained.  Again, this one stretches the limits of your credulity, so be prepared for that.
B002ZG97EC|3.0|This movie did not grip my full attention. Several parts were very humorous though and I very much hope a little kitten book comes out because I want one! The characters are adorable, the minions are a bit strange (but I suppose they are supposed to be). We rented this one and I am glad we did instead of purchasing it.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|We owe the \\"Resident Evil\\" franchise to Milla Jovovich, who has been willing to enter the zombie fray again and again, with great effect.  Milla is by no means a \\"B\\" movie actress.  She has demonstrated her dimension in other, serious films, such as \\"Joan of Arc.\\"  Consequently, she can bring a level of drama and expertise to these otherwise tawdry films, like no other.  She has perfected the \\"stare.\\"  With her beautiful but unsettling gaze, you cannot help but accept her as something unnatural, beyond the ordinary, and a fearsome force to be reckoned with.  Mila somehow makes the unbelievable believable, and her undaunting strength is what glues us to the screen.  Since she is comfortable acting in small but serious roles, while continuing to make a bundle on \\"Resident Evil,\\" we should see her for some time to come.  Thank you Milla for providing so much outrageous fantasy material to digest.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I purchased this for my boyfriend. And we both loved it! not only the picture and all the perks was fantastic. But, the price was perfect!!   and it got to my house fast! :)
B002WY65VU|3.0|I'm particular when it comes to zombie movies.  The lower-budget efforts have generally been big disappointments (boring).  I'm a \\"Resident Evil\\" fan, so my standards are a bit higher than the norm (I guess).  I watched Zombieland on a whim, expecting absolutely nothing other than turning it off within 15 minutes.  But, to my delight the film displayed wit, humor and irony.  In some sense it is a poke at the entire genre, which is totally fine.  The non-zombie actors are all well-cast.  Harrelson goes way over the top in his unexpected encounter with a cameo appearance by Bill Murray.  Somehow, this is forgivable because who knows where the \\"top\\" exists for Harrelson.  The man seems to have no bounds.  (Loved him as Larry Flynt.)  What's pleasing about this film is its self-deprecating sense of humor, some unexpected surprises, and the unrestrained, pull-out-all-the-stops attack upon the zombies.  For a lower-budget, highly confined genre film it delivers more than I expected.  This could become a cult classic.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|As much as you crave for Star Wars in Blu-Ray format do yourself a favor and wait for a proper widescreen release. Or if you feel like throwing away some money think of a charity foundation, not 20th Century Fox.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|What a happy time we live in where Milla Jovovich can continue to kick butt in her series of \\"Resident Evil\\" films, and we also have Kate Beckinsale in skin-tight latex fighting nasty vampires and werewolves.  Like Milla, Bekinsale is a studied actress -- no bimbo \\"B\\" rated, untrained actress.  Thus, we are exposed to a convincing actress taking on an unimaginable role -- and successfully.  It is no fluke that Becksale is repeatedly brought back to continue the \\"Underworld\\" franchise.  She may feel that these features are nothing more than lucrative expenditures of time and energy.  Even if that is the case, she is creating a series of cult classics, highly revered by members of the genre.  For myself, I find that the \\"Underworld\\" series is at the top of the heap, combining great FX with an intriguing myth concerning the undead.  I take exception to the Amazon review that would pound this form of entertainment into the ground.  Unlike so many critics, they do not consider what a film project sets out to accomplish vs. the finished project.  \\"Underworld Evolution\\" never aspired to be anything more than it is.  To imagine so is ridiculous, vain, and completely out of touch with the various levels/genres of movie-making.  The cast, crew, director and producers have no false hopes of creating the next \\"Citizen Kane.\\"  I don't know where Amazon picks up these dim-witted \\"reviewers.\\"  They seem smug, uneducated and with a false sense of superiority.  Judge a film by what it hopes to achieve.  Don't try to lump all film projects into a heap.  Such films as \\"Underworld Evolution\\" are designed for pure entertainment -- probably to a limited audience.  In this respect the film is a success.  It accomplishes its objectives and leaves the \\"select\\" audience satisfied.  I wish you overbearing, pseudo-intellectual reviewers would just stick with art-films and Oscar-contending nominations.  We'd all be a lot happier with your absence.

If \\"Lost\\" had lasted two seasons, what sort of end would the writers have provided us?  Startled by the success of the show, the writers weaved complex characters with a complex plot -- thereby keeping the island afloat for seven seasons.  The program is to be applauded for its addictive nature.  Surpassing all other soap operas, \\"Lost\\" pressed the viewer's imagination.  That the show fluctuated in style and focus from one season to the next is forgivable.  Consistency was not one of its major strengths.  From starting out as a kind of Irwin Allen-like catastrophe and survivability premise, the show eventually drifted into the supernatural.  This drift wasn't necessarily an improvement upon season one.  If I could subtract season seven, I'd give the show a full five stars.  However, the seventh season revealed the utter bankruptcy of the writers.  Perhaps from the start, no one had a clue how to end such a bold and fatiguing journey.  This is how it seems.  To resolve the unresolvable, the writers jumped the fence, offering a hollow, fatuously transcendent end to what started off as a mere adventure series.  The strange (forced?) interconnectedness of the characters created an additional layer of mystery (and unbelievability).  Ultimately, it was the characters and the actors who grew into portraying them is what drew us back to watch every episode.  This, far more than the often-times circumlocutious storyline, is what glued the audience to the series.  Any accolades must be left at the feet of the superb acting team who created a sense of realism out of a schlocky, banged-together story.tory.
B004ISVH6G|5.0|I don't take time to write rviews very often. In this case though, it was warranted.     John Waite is one ofnthe greatest rock singers of our thine. Sadly for him, his fame isn't equal to his talent. Other than \\"Missing You\\", most people couldn't tell you who he is.     I've been a huge fan since the Babys, and own all of the recordings I've found that he's made.     This is a fantastic cd. Every song is great, with a few standouts. Johns voice is still terrific, soulful and full of expression and emotion. He still has the range too. Few singers of this era still have it like thiis, Paul Rodgers being the closest.     Buy this cd. You won't be sorry!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Every McKennitt listener has often longed for an album of tracks that pay tribute to Ireland & the Celts, and while Loreena has consistently produced sets that are more Eastern oriented, this marks the first time shes gone head-on and tackled such rich source material from the Irish Songbook.<br /><br />And of course, this is a natural fit. Many of us have long thought that McKennitts' voice is ideally suited toward Celtic songs, perhaps even more so than Enya's, but to see these old classics come to life under her tutelage is a wonder of its own. The album is also solidly divided into obvious categories - uptempo, ballads, and instrumentals (with vocal backing at times). For a change, the ballads shine through, on recordings such as \\"An Ancient Muse\\" they often seemed meandering, but it seems McKennitt has got it figured out on this one - consider \\"The Death of Queen Jane\\" - with any other songstress this could have gone terribly wrong, but here its almost epic.<br /><br />The standout would have to be the very atmospheric and experimental title track \\"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\\" - this is a traditional piece but is far the most acoustic thing here - as it is, it is cold, distant and rocky - much like the sparse mountains and hills of the area it is culled from - and if its mood and memory you're after, this is definitely the go-to track. On more upbeat traditionals such as \\"The Star of the Country Down\\", its evident that the term 'instant classic' could be applied without the slightest falter. These songs were made to be sung by McKennitt's dexterous voice; and I suspect they will find their way onto any traditional Irish playlist as a standard.<br /><br />If you gravitated toward the more instrumental and hook-oriented pieces of Loreena's past such as \\"Marco Polo\\", then this album has \\"Brian Boru's March\\", a largely instrumental track that captures in essence what this entire project is all about. Riveting. Even on tracks that seem to be far too traditional in nature (and indeed, that is the point of this record), the singer is able to bring to it a lot of dignity and nuance, which is why this is a quality enterprise in totality. Regard \\"On a Bright May Morning\\", a song that in anyone elses' hands would have been a snoozefest - here its transformed into an anthem of sorts.<br /><br />The closer, \\"The Parting Glass\\" is a poignant piece of work that comes and goes as a whisper - feathery, delicate, yet beautifully structured. The crystal clear vocals and attentional to instrumentation and musical detail will have you reaching for the repeat button. In fact, that can be said of this entire project, which easily shines on its own within Loreena's own discography. Granted, its an acquired taste if you do not normally listen to Celtic music or aren't very fond of it, but theres something here for everyone. Fans of the \\"Celtic Woman\\" series, Clannad, Enya, or even Afro Celt Sound System, will find much to gather here.<br /><br />Five Stars. Indispensable addition to the world music catalog.hat is the point of this record), the singer is able to bring to it a lot of dignity and nuance, which is why this is a quality enterprise in totality.

076115678X|5.0|Curly Girl by Lorraine Massey and the products she has produced (DevaCurl)were just what I, and many others, needed who are learning to love who they are, what kind of hair they have and how to care for it naturally.  Years ago I at a time in my life when my husband requested I not color my hair anymore, but instead just be myself, I learned how to love what God has given me and my unique appearance.  I read the book, \\"Going Gray\\", about learning to love your gray hair and it was good for me at that time.  In fact, I shared my new outlook with others when they complimented me on my hair, or vice versa.    Then there were people who told me that after a certain age, women shouldn't wear their hair long.  They would bug me to cut my hair like theirs, short and spiky. I have had long hair most of my life and that is who I am.  My husband liked it that way and I looked good with it, so there was another decision to make.       Now I am excited to tell you how great it was to find other 'curly girls' (girlygirl.com) who cannot or do not want to have straight hair even if  most of the celebrities are setting that fashion.  We love our curly/wavy hair and we want to know how to care for it.  Curly Girl is the manual you need to do this.  It covers all kinds of issues, how-to's, types of curls, and how to care for them and has many \\"curl confessions\\" from other's experiences.   There's even a DVD to watch for clearer explanations, or to share with your friends. I challenge you to be who you are and check out this book.  It's worth the money.
B004M3H17Q|5.0|The first time I heard James Blake was a few months ago, after reading a Pitchfork reviewer rave over his EPs. I had a listen, and couldn't quite digest this seemingly alien sound being pumped through my headset.    Then James' eponymous album arrived and I had the chills the entire listen. There is nothing else like it out there. The tracks are marked with quiet, intense emotion. Every moment of silence, every blip, every piano chord, every vocal manipulation (or lack thereof in some cases) portrays a deeply-felt yearning sadness. Sometimes that emotion can be felt physically, especially if you turn up \\"Limit to your Love\\" and let the deep, vibrating bass pound your chest. It literally feels like the moment you find out your love doesn't love you back. This guy really knows what he's doing, and I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next. Oh and did I mention he has a wonderfully-broken, soulful voice? This guy can really croon.    This album may take some patience, but it is well worth the perseverance. It's pretty much all I've been listening to for a week.    If you like this album, check out his EPs. They are mind-bendingly good. Also, several of his DJ mixes are up on youtube. I highly recommend his mix of Untold's \\"Stop what you're doing,\\" his Lil Wayne \\"A Milli\\" mix and his Bells Sketch material, which isn't available on Amazon currently.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was BLOWN AWAY as I read O. Scott Card's masterpiece. This book has everything a SciFi novel needs and more. Ender, the protagonist, is Luke Skywalker, Jason Bourne, and even Alexander the Great combined! Ironically, I was about to embark on a looooong Star Wars EU novel journey, but by the first ten-no, five-pages, The Krytos Trap had fallen out of my hand. All in all, on a scale of one to ten, Ender's Game was an easy 895.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed the characters and the plot.  But i agree with the reviewers that the ending is very frustrating because there is no resolution to any of the mysteries put forth in the plot.  i suggest waiting for book two to be published before reading this book.  you will enjoy the story then.
0312380852|5.0|I loved this book of Micro-Macrame.  I have been beading for almost 20yrs, & decided it was time for a change, but had to have my beads incorporated in whatever I did. The writer is fantastic,  & the beautiful work she does isn't hard at all.  I have never done any type of medium, other than working with just beads & thread, & a little bead crochet,  & I've already made a few of her items.  I actually have a list of the things in this book that I want to make.  Fantastic change from 'just' working with  my beads, & it also incorporates them too, so that's even better, although, I think that even without the beads, I would love this book anyway.  It's beautiful, just to look at, even if I wasn't going to use it, (which I can't imagine)!

1439107955|5.0|For those of us who are fascinated with science and medicine, yet do not read heavy textbooks for pleasure, this is the perfect book.  I first heard a review on NPR, and the author was interviewed on another show, and I was intrigued.  How can you make such a difficult and emotional topic sound interesting, entertaining and understandable.  This book does it by providing almost a Fiction approach to the autobiography of cancer.  It is a long read, but a worthwhile investment of your time.
1400052173|5.0|When Henrietta Lacks died in 1951, she didn't take everything with her. The doctors at Johns Hopkins took samples of her cancerous cervical tissue and turned them over to researchers, who discovered their amazing properties - HeLa, as the cells were named, became the first immortal cell line. Samples of the hardy cells were shipped all over the world, and for the first time incredibly advanced scientific research became possible. From the polio vaccine to space exploration to atomic bomb experiments, HeLa cells are seemingly omnipresent in a way Henrietta would never be... especially for her own children.    Henrietta's family was terribly afflicted by her swift and tragic death. They would not know that their mother's cancer had been transformed into an almost magical way to perform experiments and test treatments. Those treatments would be nothing her impoverished family could afford, even in their later years. As the story grows, it becomes ethically thorny and makes the reader confront issues like informed consent, patient confidentiality, the racially segregated medical profession of the 1950s and 60s, and the difference education can make when it comes to health care decisions. The author eventually makes significant contact with Henrietta's youngest surviving daughter, Deborah, and attempts to answer the question that both science, the public, and even Deborah herself find difficult to answer: who was(is) Henrietta Lacks?    It's a highly readable book, a fascinating journey into one private American family's experience with the public face of medicine. The effect that Henrietta's cells have had on science over the last 59 years has literally transformed the limits of knowledge about the human body, yet her family was never compensated for the billion-dollar business that HeLa cell lines drive even to this very day. This is the piece of nonfiction that everyone will be talking about for years to come.
B001SS3JS8|4.0|This is my first Jodi Picoult novel... I don't know what her novels are like typically. But this one is pretty unrealistic. But hey, it's fiction, right?  But as I read I had to wonder what sensible pair of parents would throw two children - a boy and girl - together so hard? I sensed that the parents wanted the children to marry at least in part so the parents' friendship would remain strong. The two adult couples were almost adulterous in their friendship. There is definitely a theme of selfishness throughout the story line among the adults contrasted against the total unselfishness of the two teenagers.    The parents' glib acceptance that their kids were sexually active, as if that is no big deal, bothered me. Did they accept it because it led to their goal of seeing the children married?  Or were they just self-absorbed and clueless?  Either way, their lack of reaction to the whole situation was troubling to me. And what kind of boyfriend - or decent person for that fact - would go along with a suicide without running to someone - a teacher, a parent, a coach, any adult - for help??  Chris was a bright boy. He had resources.  Then there were all the story lines that were left hanging. I think in part the reader probably is suppose to see how hard it is to get a real picture of a complex story when so many people only know a part of the story - and only one person knows the whole story. The art therapist clued in on the sexual abuse but the nurse practitioner didn't, despite the evidence. The art teacher saw the change in Emily's artwork but didn't know what to make of it. Emily's mother knew what Emily's diary said but she burned it up and never mentioned it again.  I read the whole book - stayed up late last night to finish it. It was compelling.  And now that I've finished it, I'm not sure how I feel about the ending.  If the author wanted the reader to walk away troubled, frustrated and a bit annoyed, she succeeded... because I am. Read it for yourself and see what you think!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For the price I was worried this bag may not be as good as what I was looking for but to Amazon's Backpack was exactly what I was looking for. The quality is great! Plenty of spaces for all my equipment (DSLR, Battery Pack, 3 Lens, Batteries, Lens Hoods and Caps, and some other things). I'm so glad I ordered this bag. The build quality is great as well. I believe I'll be using this bag for awhile. Thanks Amazon!
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Frozen is more a psychological study than a horror film, though the scenario is undeniably horrific, as is the eventual outcome. Effective character development connects us with the protagonists as we follow them through events leading up to their isolation, dangling some 30 or 40 feet in the air on a rickety ski lift.    Early on I found myself cleverly thinking I knew how the film would play out, but I was wrong. The story is so well presented that I didn't even wonder how my girlfriend and I managed to sit for an hour and a half watching it unfold.    Trapped on a ski lift with no way down, and no one around, the characters are thrust into the unthinkable, and we see them working through the varied emotions that one might imagine to feel in such a situation.    Through it all I kept trying to think of what I would do to get myself out of it, but the answers just aren't that simple. The characters have very little to work with, and as their emotions twist their perceptions of the surroundings, and each other, we see just how very difficult it would be to think rationally for a solution to the problem.    There really is no easy solution, under the circumstances, and the circumstances come in a variety of forms. First, complete isolation, they are forgotten. Second, panic, anger and fear are compounded by subtle regression to more instinctive responses to the situation. Third, nature's cold shoulder.    Clever use of visuals and sound. Excellent cinematography, makeup and effects.    I'd watch it again.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD is gorgeous.  The last song Someone Like You is so beautiful.  Rolling in the Deep of course is great.  The thing is all the songs are amazing.  There is no filler.  I kept expecting maybe the next song wouldn't be so incredible but every song on the CD is.  It's a masterpiece.  Adele is a really gifted soul.  Never heard of her before.  I popped this in my car stereo and I was blown away by both her bluesy beautiful voice and the incredibly deep lyrics..love songs yes but they were original and often heartbreaking.  Nothing about this CD is typical.  I recommend this so HUGELY..it does not ever disappoint but it continually amazes.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.
0843189673|5.0|I read these books as a child and they are just as good as ever, I bought them to read to my 4 month old and his attention span is way too short for them but they will be a family favorite as he gets older, would definitely recommend these as a great buy
B002RKXO5O|5.0|I'd like to say I'm not a big Take That fan... before having this DVD the only song I actually knew was the classic Back For Good. I found out about this concert when it was broadcast on TV in my country like a year ago, so I started watching, captivated by the AMAZING view of a sold-out Wembley Stadium and the incredible stage, and I actually ended up loving the show, even though I didn't know most of the words! I would say this one is a must have for any music lover, not just for Take That fans, but for anybody who appreciates music and the real spirit of a concert: awesome musicians, stage, special effects and the fans, all of that made this not only a simple live concert, but a real spectacle, a real circus!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this one to everybody, give it a shot, it is definitely worth every cent!
B001Q8FRVC|5.0|This is it. That´s all i have to say about this LP, with all the tracks being perfectly made by Offspring...    Nowadays bands don´t even know what they are doing, overproduced by the Record Label´s , adulterating all the work of the musicians simply for money and profit.    THIS LP,SHOWS, WHAT THE PUNK/HARDCORE SCENE WAS ALL ABOUT. ROOTS MUSIC,DEEP ROOTS MUSIC.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|The doctor in and better than ever! Matt Smith brings a little Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee to  his character and I SWEAR I see a hint of Michael Palin now and then. The writing is excellent,  the actors are fantastic - which equals fun,fun,fun.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|Initially I noticed that this movie got poor to fair reviews so I rented it first.  This movie kept my attention from the beginning to the end.  I was dissapointed that their was no clarification on the crab-thing on Clair's chest, and where were/are the rest of the kids from the previous movie.  Unfortunately, Clair had amnesia and was no help in explaining a thing.  I thought this was going to be the last one but they left the ending open.  I hope they follow up with another one.  Overall, not a bad movie.  Seemed like the dead are getting smarter.  ???

It caused to me read other books by Doris Kearns Goodwin, all of which have been amazing. She is truly an inspired writer and makes every topic she writes about exciting.  Loved it.
1419553429|5.0|I'm currently self-study for the GMAT and I plan to take it sometime this year. I generally do pretty well on standardized tests, scoring in the 99th percentile on the ACT and 96th percentile on the SAT, so naturally I gravitated towards this book when I saw it at Barnes and Noble. The questions in this book had me batting around .700 - .750 in most sections, and less than .500 in the data sufficiency questions (which I found extremely challenging).    I completed the book and moved onto Princeton Review's Math Workout for the GMAT 3rd Edition, and thus far the questions have been a breeze.    I highly recommend this book if you're seeking practice for a top score for a strong application to an elite MBA program.
0812968255|3.0|I poorly chose to read this book straight through and feel I did not give it enough time to sink in.  This is a compilation of more or less random musings by the emperor, and while there are themes that seem to surface, it can jump around a bit.  Still, his tenets appeal both to logic and emotion, effectively placing themselves in your mind for review throughout the day.<br /><br />The introduction by Gregory Hays does a good job setting up the collection, explaining the format and picking out some of the main ideas.  In retrospect, I was impressed with how cohesive the intro made the book and feel I would have been bewilderingly lost without it or some other semi-summary.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I think this series even more so than Band of Brothers depicts the horror of war.  From exploding bodies to rotting corpses covered in maggots this pretty much covers it.  I would not watch it again because I have learned from it what I wanted to.  It is not meant to be entertaining.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|If you want to see how high functioning an autistic person can be, watch this movie. It sheds the light on real experience and true story exposing the struggle with autism and how it can be won against and live successful life with great achievements.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|by \\"intimidated\\" I only mean the length of the book. other kindle books I've read have had about 7-8000 \\"locations\\", whereas this one has nearly 16000. So, as a newly developed avid reader (meaning I haven't read a book in 10 years, then now this is my 4th in only about 3 months) I was a little overwhelmed. HOWEVER, the flow of the story really makes you forget you're reading so much. Lots of detail (sometimes almost too much) but enough to keep the reader's attention and move the story along. The detail is more for ambiance than filler, which I really like, since a lot of books I've tried to read overkill the detail (and ended up killing my desire to read it).<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is that just when one person's storyline is really getting good... he switches to another character. Yes, this makes you keep on reading, but I admit there are times when I've wanted to just skip ahead and read the next part of that person just because I was so caught up in it.<br /><br />I bought the other 3 kindle books, so I guess that's saying something. I'm about 90% thru Clash, and hope that Dance of Dragons comes out before I've read Sword and Feast.
B000LV63SQ|5.0|I originally owned this on cassette back when it was first released.  Needless to say, use and age wore that out.  When this first got released on CD, I snapped up a copy immediately.  From the time I first heard it, I considered it a CLASSIC!<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a track-by-track commentary.  I just want to say that overall, the album is sonically simple... lots of acoustic guitar with Pete and Ronnie singing... definitely not a Who album.  There are a couple of exceptions, like Street in the City which has an orchestra, but it is used quite tastefully.  Other than that, it has a nice homemade feel.<br /><br />To wrap up: I love this album, but many people don't remember it because it wasn't really a Pete Townshend solo album and it wasn't played on the radio much back then... but that's because of the simple sound of it and it didn't fit in with the rock of the day.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who knows and appreciates good music.
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is another thriller by Suzanne Collins. This second book in the series improves on the first book, The Hunger Games. There is more war between the districts and more suspense on every page. I could not begin to predict what would happen in this book. The Hunger Games left me hungry for more Suzanne Collins and Catching Fire more than satisfied my appetite.<br /><br />I found that Catching Fire only smoldered during the first few chapters; after that, the book really caught fire. The pace picked up by the second chapter and I found the remainder of the book to be as enjoyable as the first. I really enjoyed President Snow's punishment for the act of rebellion Katniss Everdean and Peeta Malark committed in the seventy forth Hunger Games and the reaction of the people in the Capital to the rebellion.<br /><br />The detail in this book is shocking and very gruesome. If you liked The Hunger Games, Catching Fire will be a guaranteed enjoyable read. Suzanne Collins focuses this plot toward the teenage reader. It is very unique with plot twists at every turn. You will not regret reading this spectacular book.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this mobile for my third child and it is by far my favorite one. I usually by a cute one to match my baby's bedding but this time I wanted something different and this was the best mobile I could find. It has different kinds of music, remote, very colorful, and moves which are good for a baby learning new things. Great item and would recommend to anyone!
B003XU75QG|5.0|In a world where there's not much \\"rock\\" in rock n' roll these days, \\"Light Me Up\\" by The Pretty Reckless is quite refreshing and a big sigh of relief. Taylor Momsen sure knows how to deliver a good rock album. When I look at the cover, it reminds me of a 90's rock band album cover like Nirvana or something of that sort, which is incredible. \\"Since You're Gone\\" is a favorite, along with \\"Light Me Up\\" which basically is a big \\"screw you\\" to everyone who loves to judge you. \\"You\\" is simply stated yet beautiful with a Beatles touch to it. I definitely recommend this album. You will NOT be disappointed.
0143117564|1.0|Wow, where should I begin? I have never read a book by Thomas Pynchon before, and after this piece of garbage, I will not seek another one out. I should have known when there was a full 2 pages of reviews by every magazine and professional reviewer praising what a wonderful book this is. I am beginning to think the \\"professionals\\" just like crap. It is as if this author was stoned the entire time he wrote this. There is not a single coherent thought in it. Hunter S Thompson would wander of the topic, but at least he would return, this \\"writer\\" seems to forget to. The story if you want to call it that is weak at best, and you can't possibly care about any of the characters or what happens to them. The Author is the type that critics love to refer to as edgy but in this case as it is in most what they really should say is the writing is horrible! The last book that I read that was this bad was from another critic's darling Thomas McGuane's 92 Degrees In The Shade, another example of a writer who somehow gets a book published that he wrote completely stoned.  NEVER BUY BOOKS THAT CRITICS RAVE ABOUT, THEY ALWAYS SUCK!!!
B00000634K|5.0|This album is great for me because it contains most of the tumes I like best done by John Lennon. I love the cassette as that is all I can play in my  olden day car! :)
B003405MF6|5.0|People around me in high school influenced me to buy \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Wired\\" when they were new releases. Unlike others here who seem to yearn for more of the same, I never quite gave in to these records. I still have them and if I ever get around to getting another turntable, I will pull them out again to see if I can figure out why not, or if I was just nuts.  I bought about a thousand records since then, none of them Jeff Beck's.   Then I heard \\"Jeff\\" in a record store when it was released, not recognizing the sound or style and asked the kid who this was. It just got better and better as it went on. It started with motorcycles and biker chicks and by the end there was a orchestra of strings.  I think that's what kept me in the store so long. \\"Figures\\" I thought, a little disappointed that I would be buying an artist from the 70's once again, instead of quenching my thirst for new blood. I loved the album, though. It covered a lot of ground, made sounds I'd never heard come out of a guitar. It showed an artist in touch with his past, but not dwelling on it. In retrospect this album seems a bridge to \\"Emotion and Commotion\\". I love that Beck has evolved, and not fallen into the \\"you name the state State Fair Circuit\\" like most of the bands from the seventies that still turn up somewhere on the 4th of July playing the same old stuff.   This new record is priceless. Not much new song-writing here, rather thoughtful, skillful (crazy skillful) emotive guitar you won't hear anywhere else on obscure and familiar work of other artists.  Actually, the \\"Commotion\\" on this record stands out less than the \\"Emotion\\". The bookend songs are so exquisite they make me weepy (the older softer badboy). I only wish it were 140 minutes.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|Watched the DVD yesterday & was very impressed with the movie. Mostly all people know that lot of malpractices are going on in Govt. corporate,banking,stock markets, this movie exposes how these people manipulate things to fill their coffers. There is no end of their greed. This DVD is a MUST watch for every citizen in this World. It exposes how these people ruin the lives of common (even rich) people. Only the super duper rich people are spared & why would they complain they are getting richer by the day with the help of these corrupt people. Whatever happened in US before 3 yrs is about to happen everywhere else.

The voices, the instruments, the lyrics, the harmonies, the melodies are just astounding. It's folk-rock or rock-folk unplugged, yet electrifying in its energetic delivery. Lush and articulate vocals with masterful instrumentation. I wish these guys the best and hope they can find a little happiness to write about in future work. I have heard a couple good bands in the last year or two begin to fill the void of art in music the last 25 years, especially by male artists/bands, but these guys are the best I've heard.   I can't believe I learned about these guys on the Grammy's. I actually bought four cd's after watching the Grammy's. What is this world coming to?  Front to back, this is a great cd. Great price on Amazon, too.
B0044430H8|2.0|Having seen and enjoyed the movie, I know this score works adequately to set the various moods required by the narrative.  However, there is nothing inherent in this score that appeals to me aesthetically.  Listening to it without the visuals makes me want to chew glass.  To me, it's more \\"sound design\\" than \\"music score.\\" And two composers?  I can only imagine one warned the other if he got too close to an actual melody.
B004FEFZU2|1.0|I own over 20 3d-bluray titles and they all playback wonderfully on my system. However, Saw-3D played back in a herky-jerky manner and seemed to freeze-then thaw as it bumped along. I return the disc to amazon for another, but I had the same results! So, I popped in Avatar and it played back as expected. I asked for a refund and Amazon was kind enough to refund my money. Beware.
0439023491|5.0|I am going to keep my review short and simple, with no spoilers. This is a great book. I was skeptical about this book when I first purchased it, but I was quickly hooked. This is one of my favorites. Highly recommend to anybody who doesn't mind some intense parts.
1576754227|5.0|With the new year just around the corner, there are all kinds of intentions floating around. But, be it the cold weather or the less than pleasant tasks involved, procrastination quickly sets in and our resolutions are tucked away, never to become a reality. If you're ready to take on your resolutions with intention this year, Brian Tracy's \\"Eat the Frog!\\" is the book for you. In his powerful book on overcoming procrastination, Tracy shares 21 ways to organize, prioritize, and move ahead with any project! If this is the year that you're serious about your resolutions, I highly recommend that you \\"eat your frog!\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my first Jillian Michaels DVD and the only workout DVD that actually works with my schedule while giving me an amazing workout!  I recommend this DVD to everyone!  It is a grueling 20 minutes but you know you are getting an amazing workout and will have amazing results!  I completed a week of the workout and then ended up tweeking my knee so I have not used it in about a week.  I plan on starting up again tonight now that my knee feels better.  I can't wait!
0743201140|5.0|In their new book, authors Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton suggest that we tend to focus on what needs to be \\"fixed\\" with ourselves. Then, they demonstrate how fluid and successful life is when we set aside our shortcomings and truly leverage our own strengths. The book illustrates how knowing your personal strengths, and recognizing the strengths of those around you, can help you build a dynamic and successful organization, network, or team.<br /><br />An even bigger BONUS is that you get a personal code for an online survey that identifies YOUR \\"top- five inborn talents\\"! This benefit is worth every penny you spend on the book! Identifying your top 5 strengths will change the way you look at life. This assessment is unique from the many other assessments out there (i.e. Myers-Briggs, DISC, etc.). With the \\"strengths\\" information in hand, you will be able to apply the theories presented in the book on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book: it is a refreshing concept that moves you forward by focusing on the positive and teaching you how to maximize your full potential!
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|A good movie for teens who may think the world is a little unfair. I hope they get the message at the end of the movie; it's not always a fair place, realize and appreciate the good things in your life before it's too late.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love the Toy Story gang, and this movie is no different. They get into trouble and have to figure a way out before it's too late. It's great fun but the story should end with this one.
0316098337|1.0|If you like a book that is told from the view point of a 5 year old that describes every tiny detail over and over than you might enjoy this book.  I found myself fast forwarding through most of the book.  The story premise itself was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more if more time had been spent in developing the adult character.  (Spoiler Alert).... The suicide attempt of the the mother after rescue comes out of the blue with no real delving into her thinking.
B000W1TJ7W|5.0|If you love hard rock, you cannot leave this earth without hearing this album.  There's just something about the sound of this album that makes it so unique.  Unique to all other Rush albums and unique to any other rock album ever made.  No filler, but Camera Eye seems a little weak compared to all the other amazing tracks.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I don't like reviews by people who haven't purchased the item or actually used it. That being stated, I have had this for just over a week. I cannot max it out unless I am converting video. Even when I am converting video, my other programs run fine. I have used dual processor and dual core systems for several years. I am used to everything getting bogged down when trying some heavy work. I put it on a Gigabyte GA-890FXA-UD5 (rev. 2.0) board with 8GB of DDR3 KHX1600C9D3K2. I will admit I am used to my system benchmarking at a different level than what others report. Usually mine is lower. That is not the case this time. Passmark reports that I should get a CPU mark around 6045. Mine is coming in at 7025. I know you will have a different setup and probably want it for gaming. I will be running VMs and converting my DVDs to video files for my set top player. But if you are looking for an upgrade this is well worth the money. Just make sure you remember that it is the total package which delivers the performance. I spent less than I did for the laptop I'm using to write this review and it only performs around 1300 on CPU mark. Between the overclocking otpions on the board and this being a BLACK edition, I am going to be very happy with this purchase.
B000002AHM|5.0|What more could be said about the performance than 4 billion stars.  Besides the performance, count this among the very first CD's released. SONY chose it for the first batch ever, my CD was direct from Tokyo 1982, too bad the liner is all Japanese!  3500 yen then. It says Digital Master but this before AAD or ADD or DDD so not sure since a vinyl exists also.  It sounds great after 30 years.  Possibly all digital since an HDCD release is reported available.  In any case a terrific engineering accomplishment.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I like Nora Roberts. I like what I know I can expect from her. I like that almost everything I've ever read that she has written has been readable. Her newer books that have been published in hard cover first, like this new one, tend to have more layers and are more complicated than her older, shorter books.     I'm not expecting a literary novel. And I'm grateful that this isn't one. It is a romance with two people you would like to know who have friends you would also like to know, with a complicated in-depth background that is interesting to find out about. As usual, at least one of the couple has a history. In this case the woman is the only surviving victim of a serial killer. Which makes her quite interesting because she not only survived, she grew.    Usually the research into the skill sets of the characters is pretty good in a Nora Roberts book, but in this one case she got the background of a very minor character wrong. The character is a dementia patient who gets lost in the woods and who the search and rescue team finds and saves. The character doesn't have early onset dementia. He is in his 80s. Early Onset means that the patient has to be under 65, or preferably 60. Nor can he be in the early stages of the disease (which might be what Roberts meant). You don't get lost in the early stages of the disease. And you don't try to \\"go home\\" in that stage either. It is a minor character so I'm not deducting a star.    It was a good read and I enjoyed reading it on my Kindle.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|From a novel it maybe but a great incite to the officers and men of His Majesty ships of the once powerful Royal Navy. God help any Frenchie that appeared on the horizon. Powerful cinematography, expertly handled with a vigorous handle on detail. Great film.  Hearts of Oak.
6300182193|5.0|It's a story of good and evil. This is a great movie about love that never dies. Frank makes the character of Dracula come to life. this is a movie that I can watch over and over. This version of the classic is a lot more sensual than some. I give this a 5 star movie.
0066214122|1.0|I'm not an expert in nanotechnology, but obviously neither is the author. It's fine to exaggerate the science in fiction, but Crichton introduces this as plausible in the real world.  I don't think so.       His pseudoscientific explanations are BORING and slow down the pace of an already very slow moving story.  The characters are unrealistic, bombastic and stupid simpletons.  The plot line is a compilation of many finer works.  The dialog is bad.  This is just a real disappointment.    Do not waste your time.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|I purchased the CD/DVD. I find myself Loving live recordings of my favorite artists<br />more and more. We had live recordings when I was a teen....except for Frampton and Kiss they generally Sucked. Now with so much great technology artsists can record Live and sound GREAT....This is a Great Live set that actually is better to watch on DVD then listen to. James and Carole are Wonderful together. I love them Both.<br />Watching them perform made me Sad and Happy....Sad for the music I Miss....Happy for how Great they both look and sound Today.....Wow! To listen to this recording<br />however is why I gave it four instead of five stars....its Ok.  This is truly a visual and audio moment to be savored. If you just want to listen...I recommend Tapestry by Carole King and any of James' CDs....<br /><br />Atreides
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Saw 8 times at Theater bought as soon as it came out on DVD.    It is Sooooo Goooooodd
B0015DROBO|1.0|I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why these books are so popular.  I forced myself to finish the book and wish I hadn't wasted my time.  I found the book to be predictable and trite.  There are so many excellent books out there it boogles my mind why this trilogy is so popular.
B002VECM6S|1.0|Absurd liberal fantasy in which guilty upper middle class white family decides to forcibly raise young black impoverished male in their own image. The young black impoverished male is borderline mentally challenged and suffers from a borderline rage syndrome, but the family insists on taking him in to live with them and their 15 year old daughter, not even conducting a background check and trusting him entirely. The young black impoverished male then rises to ethereal Hollywood heights of achive-dom in which he becomes a superstar athlete and brainiac and, dazed by the veritable riches bestowed upon him by guilty liberals, goes on to a lifetime of achievement. Most comical moment of all: the NAACP holds a kangaroo court trial in which the family's choice of college for the young black impoverished male is seen as \\"suspect,\\" as though they have any legal power to step into a family's business at all. This film demeans the ability of individuals to achieve their own destiny without welfare.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|Maybe i was expecting another 19 that i liked from beginning to end. This one there are some tracks that i press skip to avoid.
0374158460|1.0|I have made it 75% through and I am seriously contemplating putting this novel down.  As many of the other reviewers have stated, the characters are not believable. I found no joy in reading the about their self indulgent lives. It is a long, tedious, rambling tale...time to move on to another story.
B001VFM60A|4.0|What can i say.. linkin park is great, and i have always been a fan of the direction taken on their live dvd's. i spent about 14 bucks on mine and it was worth every penny and then some.. it is what all concert blu ray's should be... an experience.
0307595579|4.0|I think I don't need to review the books. The Millennium Trilogy is a worldwide phenomenon right know.<br />What I want to comment about is this edition.<br /><br />First; this books look great. I love the colors, and the materials they are made of. the covers are clean and beautifully made. The slipcase looks great too, and makes it easy to store or exhibit the books.<br /><br />It's important to notice that this books are bound \\"Deckle Edge\\" Paper, and some people don't like this. I personally think it looks very good.<br /><br />The reason I am giving a 4 stars review (and what made me write it in the first place) is because i just finished reading the first one, and I just noticed that the dragon in the spine and in other places where I put my hands when reading faded a little. If two or tree more people read it, they would be completely gone. Maybe someone could give me a piece of advice on how to prevent it.<br /><br />Still I like them a lot, and I think this is a beautiful edition to ad to your collection and buying as a gift.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|George Lucas is at it again!  I never seen someone create something so significant and then go back and basically ruin it and alienate his fan base.  I have bought so many different versions of these same movies and basically \\"I'm tired and I won't take it anymore!\\"  I'm interested in seeing the deleted scenes, especially from the first film that I have never seen, but have seen so much of in other media.  I don't like the \\"special editions\\" and when enough people clamored to get the original theatrical releases on DVD, fans were forced to pay for a box set that contained both versions.  The original release DVD's were bare bones with no attempt to at least clean up the picture and update the sound quality.  I've had enough of this - the best thing the fans can do is boycott these releases until we get what we want.  Until then I will stick with my shoddy DVD's of the original theatrical releases and try to see the deleted scenes through other venues.  *UPDATE* Now that this item has been released, it is in typical George Lucas fashion to have just the three movies without special features.  In order to see the deleted scenes you have to buy the full box set...the last thing I want to do is buy the first two shoddy prequels again, AND endure the butchered original trilogy.  After being such a big fan of Star Wars my whole life starting as a kid when the first movie came out...Star Wars is pretty much dead to me.
0374531269|5.0|There is no possible way for me or you, the readers, to walk in the footsteps of Ishmael Beah in [[ASIN:0374531269 A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier]]. His young life quickly filled with such terrible atrocities that some descriptions of the book are hard to read. These heinous scourges occurred in the Sierra Leone during the 1980s by rebel troops during that country's Civil War.<br /><br />As the story begins, twelve-year-old Ish has in his possession several CDs which he tries to play whenever possible. He likes the beat of the hip-hop American music and loves to emulate the clever rhymes of the rappers, even though there are many words he does not understand. When given the chance, he and his friends practice the clever angular, muscular routines of dancers who move in sync with the hard-pounding music on videos they've seen.<br /><br />Ish and his friends start out for Mattru Jong, hoping to take part in a talent show to exhibit their practiced rap language and dance moves. The journey will take several days on foot, nevertheless, the small troupe heads southeast. When they reach Ish's Grandmother's village, they refuse to stay with her and continue on. Arriving at another village, they find people terrified by news that the rebels are coming.<br /><br />Ish and his friends hear the tales of horror told by refugees coming from the west--coming from Ish's home village area. These rebels, they learn, kill for sport. They want to take over the land--more than anything, they want to be feared by all so that any spoils found in the villages they've plundered belong to them. Ish learns that his family has been murdered.<br /><br />As the boys attempt to stay one village ahead of the thrill-killer rebels, they become separated while running for their lives and hiding anywhere that seems safe. It isn't long before Ish finds himself alone in what he thinks is a wooded area near a remote village. He thinks he is [[ASIN:0374531269 A Long Way Gone]] from capture.<br /><br />During the night, the village has been surrounded by government troops who have a kill-crazy attitude toward against rebels. Ish begins to run, hiding when he can. But escape is impossible. He is running into the center of a huge circle, not away from it's outer edge. Alone, captured and humiliated, Ish has a choice to make. He must carry a gun and kill, or be killed on the spot. There are no other alternatives.<br /><br />Slowly Ish's boy brain becomes brutalized by what he sees done to those they capture. In order to survive, in order to stop running, in order to be fed and protected by the government troops, Ish emulates the older men who have taken his young brain hostage. If they kill, Ish must kill. If they torture, Ish must take part. The army has sapped his brain. He is no longer a young lad interested in rap music and clever dance moves. No, he is Ish an army killer.<br /><br />You cannot read [[ASIN:0374531269 A Long Way Gone]] without a sense of horror as you learn of the murders and horrendous act of violence committed against villagers by both sides in this Civil War. Ish is one of these army militiamen. But the reader cannot come away from A Long Way Gone without a strong sense of how far Ish has deterioriated. Is he really a killer, or has what he witnessed and personally done so strangled his brain that he can no longer think for himself. Truly, this youngster is A Long Way Gone.<br /><br />Needless to say, this book will tear at your heartstrings. What happens to Ish? Does he remain a killer? Does he ever regain a sense of civil decency that was stolen from him? Can he ever face his own conscience for what he has done? This short book is a must read for all of us who sit back in relative ease, in safety, in our homes, while young people are raped of their humanity in distant countries. How lucky we are!<br /><br />I would highly recommend [[ASIN:0374531269 A Long Way Gone]] as a must read in this country's high schools where young men and women can initially identify with Ish and his love of music, but must make their own choices with him as he falls prey to army thugs. The book will ensure great classroom discussion about common sense, common decency, and the terrible ordeals young people are suffering. I would give this book my highest 5-star recommendation.<br /><br />Other Great Reads:<br />[[ASIN:0984559825 Demons of Justice]]<br />[[ASIN:0743262786 Escape From Davao: The Forgotten Story of the Most Daring Prison Break of the Pacific War]]<br />[[ASIN:1935361333 You Know When]]st make their own choices with him as he falls prey to army thugs.

0312600844|5.0|This book so reminded me of American Beauty...not the plot, but rather the theme of boredom and sedation beneath the comfort of the middle class.  One of the main characters reads a sign on the wall of her daughter's college that reads: USE WELL THY FREEDOM.  That is a line that pressed on my chest as I read it.  I sense a listlessness in the middle class, in my generation, being 39, and much more pronounced in younger genrations...\\"what do we do with our lives\\" we ponder relentlessly.  I did read other reviews that suggested the characters were not believable, but clearly this is one of those controversial novels you connect with, or you don't.  I loved it and I connected with both Patty and Walter and have known many people that embody their complicated feelings of idealism and disillusionment.<br /> I enjoy novels that pose a critique at American complacency, but I know it makes many people uncomfortable.  Revolutionary Road, Ragtime, An American Tragedy were all ridiculed, much like Freedom has, for being \\"un-American.\\"  Yet, I don't think having a honest conversation about American culture is \\"un-American.\\"  In general, we are a very busy culture, working, shopping at The Gap etc., watching our reality t.v., drinking our Starbucks, listening to our ipods and chatting on our iphones.  Not all of us, but statistcally yes....consumerism is very much a part of middle class life and I'm not sure this lifestyle makes us \\"happy\\", more likely bored with high levels of stress.  The book simply peers at the corruption of the middle class American dream that probably many of us can relate to.<br />If you don't connect at all with feelings of discontent with our culture, than you probably will find this book dark and disturbing the way many did about American Beauty...yet it did win Best Picture.  This is the best new book I have read in a long time.
0439023521|5.0|I'm stunned... completely stunned.  A friend of mine (in her 30s!!!) bought this for me for my 26th birthday.  I had seen them on display at the local book stores, and wasn't sure what to think of them.  She told me she'd heard they were good and that she thought I might like it.  I put it off and read other books first, thinking the description didn't sound like anything I would want to read.  Boy, was I wrong!?    I was completely blown away by this novel.  It covers a lot of things -- romance, war, defeat, defiance, love, friendship, protection... it shows true struggle for the day to day things, for basic necessities, for survival against all odds.  It shows a society desperate for better days but seemingly powerless to do anything about it.    Most importantly, it shows that even a child can make a difference in the world.    To me, as popular as the Twilight series has been, this series is much better.  While Twilight's romances were trite and cliched, Collins' writing makes it a forefront part of the story without making it the main focus, and without taking the truth behind Katniss's loves (family, friends, her people, Peeta/Gale) and making it something silly and annoying.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Twilight as much as anyone.  I just feel that the Hunger Games series just blows it out of the water for entertainment, concept, and message.    (PS-- I just finished the second one, Catching Fire, right before I wrote this... can't wait for the third!!!)
B001DPC52C|5.0|I am glad i found within temptation, they are an OUTSTANDING band with great talent. I so wish the lame music stations in the u.s.  would play there music.
B000002JSJ|5.0|There are some excellent and detailed reviews for this album. This is not one of them. :) This review is simply to say that the \\"inaccessibility\\" of this album is somewhat true - perhaps a different song order might have helped matters - who knows. However, after repeat listens, it grows on you in a profound way. I've found myself turning to this playlist on my iPod frequently. Highlights are Achilles Last Stand, Nobody's Fault But Mine, Tea For One, and they refute the official Amazon reviewer's claim of it sounding like \\"generic heavy rock.\\" Not so.
0670022411|5.0|This is the first time I have taken a moment to write an Amazon Review.  This book was like a magic potion, mix a little Harry  Potter, add some Anne Rice vampire stories and throw in alchemy and science.  I loved the book.  The end felt like the beginning of a second in the series and I am waiting for it.
B003X8597A|2.0|The fact that Hitler liked this opera does not make it an opera about Hitler and the nazis or Mussolini and his fascists.   This is a director's 'take' on the opera completely changing the motivation and actions of the principals.   As such it is a travesty though well sung, played and acted.   But never believe this is Wagner's Rienzi - you only have to read the libretto to see how falsely this version represents the drama.  There is a wonderful and absolutely complete (not 9 hours) performance of the opera on cd conducted by Sir Edward Downes originally broadcast by the BBC in 1976 - well worth seeking out.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|Sun Ra, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Joe Zawinul immediately come to mind when listening to the prophetic power of Bob Marley throughout his last performance; even in declining health, they all elected to feel the warmth from the audience as long as possible....as if it was the best therapy as they came to terms with their mortality.<br /><br />After collapsing in Central Park while jogging, Marley was strongly advised to cancel the remaining dates of the U.S. tour, but he made the decision to take the stage in Pittsburgh. Without knowing the back story, there is absolutely no way a listener could state that Marley was terminally ill from cancer, with the timeless \\"Them Belly Full\\" (unfortunately) having renewed meaning today. There is a spiritual awakening in the soul through the stirring renditions of \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" and \\"Redemption Song.\\"<br /><br />His message is revelled by fans of all ages and feared by many politicians. That it will live forever is the best tribute of them all.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Let me say that I am a systems and network engineer by trade.      I fully understand troubleshooting and problem determination.  It worked great for just about 1 year in my home.  Like most LINKSYS (this is not really a CISCO product) they will always fail.  Dont event think of calling their technical support, unhelpful and condesending.  Even if after no less then 2 hours you can convince them their product is not functioning properly, they will just send you a USED so called Referbished replacement.  That replacement will probably not work as expected.  By a new product and have a problem, they will gladly send you someone elses problem as a replacement.  Their testing of their referbs is shotty at best.      May I say that this does not only apply to this item, you will find that nothing less then a verbal battle lasting no less then 2 hours will be required to convince them a replacement is in order. They will proceed to send you a REFERB that does not function properly.  Beware of linksys if you beleive support and product replacement are important.  I have been working with their equipment for years, its always the same crap.      Another thing, anything that LINKSYS sells that says VPN DONT BUY IT!  They cannot, and do not support these products.  They have a seperate support team that is absolutely clueless.     Their attitude towards the consumer and treatment is horrible at best. If you value your time and want to be treated as a loyal customer STAY AWAY FROM THESE FOLKS!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|My movie collection will remain incomplete until I can put the original version of Star Wars in there. I still have my VHS version and I will keep my VCR around as long as it takes. I'm sure SOME day G Luc will give the millions of Star Wars fans the movie they want, but until then he gets none of my money.
6305882592|4.0|I loved the product. The video worked well and there were no problems, it was just very expensive for a DVD. Love the video though!
0590463799|5.0|This is a great bedtime story and is also great for pre-reading skills if you read it every night.  My son even tries to read it to himself.  Its a classic!
B003F3NDWG|4.0|This show started with a great idea and has done an excellent job of capitalizing on it.  There are so many crime shows out there, and this easily could have become another boring attempt to join this otherwise overcrowded genre.  However, the humor and playful feel of the show is what separates it from the pack.  The actress and actor that portray Detective Beckett and Rick Castle have great chemistry together.  The supporting actors all mesh well too.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion has excellent comedic timing, and he truly makes this show great.  I love the relationship he has with his mother and daughter.  The family dynamics that exist between these three make the show more enjoyable.  I also enjoy watching the relationship between Beckett and Castle develop, but this could easily become annoying if the writers continues to keep them apart for arbitrary reasons.<br /><br />The bonus features include a couple of music videos from one of the episodes (both kind of cheesy), a blooper reel, deleted scenes, on the set with Nathan Fillion, and a few others I can't remember off the top of my head.<br /><br />As far as content goes, the show is about murder so sometimes gruesome bodies are displayed.  Some of the episodes go a little far into the sexual appetites realm (one involves s & m), but for the most part comes out cleaner than a lot of network shows.<br /><br />I'm looking foward to seeing where the writers take the show in Season 3.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I havent been this excited over a cd in ages, its brilliant, Adele is brilliant and beautiful and its just so fresh and new and original. Very soulful yet retro yet modern from beginning to end. A new masterpiece of an album, and a voice so unique! 21 is Album of the year for me.
B000002I2B|5.0|it is hard for me to decide which doors album is my favorite. but i think i would have to choose this one or their 1967 debut album. not to touch the earth is a incredible song. hello i love you is a great song. love street is great. and five to one is amazing. i can listen to this album all day
0765326353|5.0|I haven't been this engrossed in a book since reading the first \\"Dune\\" years ago.  The story is fascinating and the character development is well-worth the space devoted to it.  Sanderson mixes philosophy and politics in such a way that it rings true and doesn't at all come off as preachy.  There was one point in the middle of the book where I felt a little bogged down in the story line of Shallan.  Part of the reason was that I couldn't wait for the Kaladin-driven plot to continue.  The Shallan story line came into its own, however and I ended the book very interested in this character as well.  Of course the book finishes leaving more questions unanswered than not and I am frustrated that I have to wait for the next book in the series to come out.  I went to the library tonight to find another book to read and was doubtful that I would pick something up as compelling as this.  One other niggle - there are many editing errors in the last half of the book.  Worth mending for the paperback/next edition.  I highly recommend this book.

0425180638|1.0|I have been an avid reader for a minimum of 53 years.  I found this book to be SO BORING, that I kept falling asleep whilst trying to read it.  No surprises.  No climaxes.  I kept at it until the end, and was THRILLED TO KNOW I HAD FINISHED.  Enough said.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is my third Reacher novel.  I started with #14, Worth Dying For. I downloaded it as one of my first Kindle books based on its NY Times bestseller listing.  I enjoyed it - wasn't blown away - but I was curious about the series, so I also downloaded #1, Killing floor, and #2, Die Trying.  All the books were fun enough reads, but I do not feel the urge or any sort of excitement to read any more of the series.  The premise seems to be the same: Reacher lands in some town, gets caught up in some conspiracy or situation, and kills all the bad guys.  Nothing wrong with that, but there's no depth or intelligence to the plot or characters; it's very superficial.  This is fast food action writing all the way.  I'm sure I'll take a crack at another one in the series as a beach or vacation read down the road, but there are many other novels I'm more eager to read. As for Die Trying, it starts out interestingly enough, but many parts of the books drag and you pretty much know where it's heading by the third chapter.  About 75% of the way through I kind of felt like \\"enough already\\" and was almost bored with it.
0374158460|4.0|Once Franzen gets you hooked into the final two-thirds of the book, you simply can't put Freedom down until you get to the finish line.<br /><br />Like many reviewers, I still do indeed somewhat dislike the autobiographical section, but it does work in context of the narrative as a whole, though I thought there must've a better way to get to his ending without his (I thought) somewhat convenient tying up of the Walter and Joey narratives (I'm not being specific so as to not put any spoilers here...). But if these are flaws in the narrative, there are extremely well set-up and well-written flaws. I.e.: Franzen was clearly well aware of these points and they are not completely out of the blue, and I think reviewers tend to focus on those points because -- even if you are one of the Franzenfreude haters, as they call his critics -- one cannot deny the sheer genius and brainpower that's on display throughout the book.<br /><br />We may quibble about points here and there, but nobody is capturing the 21st century psychological and cultural zeitgeist the way Franzen is. It's a completely unique and distinctive style. The reason Franzen is so polarizing is that, even 10 years after The Corrections, he's still doing things with minutia, visceral detail, and character nobody else is doing in American fiction. Gregg Easterbrook wrote the nonfiction analysis The Progress Paradox about how as technology increases, humans seem to be more prone to depression at a personal level. What Franzen does is put this in fiction form with the undertow force of the paradox of America's delusion with freedom running below the surface at every turn of the book.<br /><br />And the characters are SO good. Franzen wrote an essay for Harper's in 1996 basically declaring an end, so to speak, to postmodernism and even whatever was or was not post-postmodernism (the latter term never really took off), and that, if writers didn't make sure to remember that they are first and foremost entertainers, not social arbiters of any influence, that novels would die off in 20 years. Basically, write your literary novels, but you better damn sure entertain in them. He then went off and backed up his words. He still writes \\"literary novels,\\" taking on quite big and important topics, but he does it with character-driven hyper-realism, as the critic James Wood calls it, or even \\"absurd realism\\" may be a better term. But it's not satire; it's still realism. His shift from narrative to character-driven literary novels was a game-changer is several ways. He may get caught up in plot points and happy endings and slightly self-indulgent riffs at times because of this shift, but his characters are gripping and page-turningly good.<br /><br />Franzen didn't kill postmodernism; it was already a corpse with a lingering fowl smell. All Franzen did was box it up in a coffin and bury it 10 feet deep so we don't have the stench of postmodernism affecting our novels anymore.<br /><br />As far as the criticism of his rampant success, it seems that folks forget his first two (experimental and narrative-driven) novels were critical successes but complete and utter commercial flops. Before The Corrections, he WAS the weirdo experimental literary novelist's novelist. His creative imaginative powers and sheer writing talent have never been in doubt; all he did was shift his method. As far as I'm concerned, he's earned his success. I never bought the argument that just because The Corrections sold 2 million copies that suddenly makes him a \\"sellout.\\"<br /><br />Whatever the \\"big-themed, socially relevant literary novel\\" is, Franzen is still writing it. He just happens to be better at it and more wildly successful at it then anyone else. Love him or hate him, his last two novels have indeed been literary \\"events\\" that are worthy of the intense scrutiny (both positive and negative) that they are getting. The man is certainly the most ambitious of American writers right not.<br /><br />As for his last two books, I do still think The Corrections is ever so slightly a smidge better, since the ending is more organic to the narrative. But it's really quibbling. For example, The Corrections was 5-star, award-winning book, whereas Freedom is a 4.5 star, award-short-listing book. I'd say that hardly qualifies as a step down.so slightly a smidge better, since the ending is more organic to the narrative. But it's really quibbling.

4770030096|5.0|I've just finished going through this book and can really recommend it to anyone beginning to learn Japanese. The lessons are based on a common structure:<br />- a target dialog which you'll expect to understand by the end of the lesson.<br />- some vocabulary.<br />- Several written exercises which involve you using the new things you've learnt in the lesson. These are a little repetitive but they help to reaffirm the things you've learnt instead of reading something once and then forgetting it the next day.<br />- A listening exercise where you have to hear what's being said and answer a question about it.<br />- A couple of short dialogues as examples.<br /><br />Each lesson ( there are 25 in the book ) takes an hour or two if you're going well, some took a bit longer for me. But they're pretty managable in an evening, which is helpful. The clever thing about this course was that the lessons build on what you're learning, so lesson 2 will include some of the things from lesson 1. I'm sure this is how all language courses work but it struck me how well done it was in this book.<br /><br />The CD is also good, with a good range of voice actors. This is actually quite important, as there are variations in the way people speak in Japan, and some of these are picked up in the different actors.<br /><br />Another reviewer noted that the book doesn't teach you the kana (the basic Japanese characters). This is sort of true, there are no exercises in the book to learn these characters, but there is a large chart of them on the back page so it's easy to remind yourself what's what. Also the only real way to learn the kana is to get a chart of them and memorise them, so I'm not sure the book could do too much more in this regard.<br /><br />Like others I would strongly recommend that you get this version of the book instead of the Romajji one. It looks a little more intimidating at first, but the kana really aren't that hard to learn and it'll make everything so much easier. Learning Japanese in Romajji is potentially problematic, because there are characters which can sound the same but are written differently in kana. If you're only learning the Romajji it's impossible to tell them apart.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent course for the self-learner, I'm on to book 2 now....lematic, because there are characters which can sound the same but are written differently in kana. If you're only learning the Romajji it's impossible to tell them apart.    Overall, this is an excellent course for the self-learner, I'm on to book 2 now....
B004132HZS|5.0|Pity it's only three episodes, but each is long enough to be a movie on it's own, which somewhat makes up.  Looking forward to next season!  If you think that Sherlock Holmes belongs in his traditional setting and is ruined by any other context, you may not like this.  But this is a great \\"What if\\" which takes many or most of the original elements of Holmes and Watson and brings them into a modern context.
B0049VGSLG|4.0|I purchased this album download a few months ago but I pretty much focused on the terrific \\"North Side Gal\\".  But after finally listening to the whole album through, I think its excellent!  Not a bad track on the album and JD's vocals really shine, especially on songs like \\"Scratching Circles\\", \\"A Gentle Awakening\\", and \\"Your Love\\".  For me, NSG is the standout track, but the album as a whole is a fun, well-done rockabilly and blues album.
B001AH6ZWY|1.0|This movie was terrible.  It had a lot of potential, and in the end was just one BIG let down.      The first device gets blown up...  but wait...  we built a second one so its okay.  Then the f'ing alien looks like her father!  get out of here!  The film starts off good (I'll give them credit there,) then it just goes to heck about the time the first device gets blown up.     It's like the writers had all their creative juices flowing, then half way through the story they decided to smoke crack and then finish.
1416955070|5.0|This book kept me reeled in hook,line, and sinker since I picked it up in the book store. I remember picking it up and then bumping into a shelf because I wasn't looking which way I was going in Borders. I have read the first two books in the Mortal Instruments series and lets just say that they are NOT a walk in the park! The main character, Clary, is kind of whiney but shows improvement in her development of understanding and acceptance as the books progress. I liked the fact that the story immediately starts off with the mysterious and charming Jace (Hottest boy in ANY YA series that I've read so far...And that includes Twilight!) and then continues on with the action and turmoil as quickly as the first chapter. I must admit that I might have been rushing through this book because of the constant encouragement of friends who in quote told me \\"If you think Twilight is good, you haven't even picked up 'The City of Bones'!\\" Now I know that Twilight is very different from this series of books because instead of the vampire being the interest, the characters in this book are hunters,and pursuers of demon creatures that come from different dimensions and roam the world that us humans live in (unaware). There are vampires,werewolves, fairies, witches, warlocks, and additional otherworldly creatures that take place in the book but they are either being hunted or tolerated. In this book Jace, Alec, and Isabel are all shadowhunters who hunt and kill demons, (werewolves, vampires, witches, warlocks, and fairies are not demons)when Clary sees the three of them killing a demon in its human form she gets really freaked out but no where as freaked as the three of them who can't believe that a mortal has \\"The Sight\\" but Clary doesn't know that the reason she can see and hear these shadowhunters is because she has shadowhunter blood herself. Her mother has been keeping secrets from her for much too long and needs to let her daughter know about her dark and secretive past but by the time Clary begins to figure things out, her mother is kidnapped and Clary must find and reclaim her from Valentine, the antagonist. That is just where the story begins....he time Clary begins to figure things out, her mother is kidnapped and Clary must find and reclaim her from Valentine, the antagonist.

B003LXSY60|5.0|This band comes at you with well balanced distortion and nice syncopated drum beats.  Can't help but feel the good part of early Cream in their playing. If you have any doubts 'bout what I say, take a listen to the fifth track, She's Long Gone, and tell me if you don't think these guys have some serious funk running through their veins.  Anybody who says 'rock is dead' is obviously wrong.  It's alive out there, and the Black Keys provide the evidence.
B003XU75QG|5.0|When I first heard that Taylor Momsen was going to be on Gossip Girl less because she was starting her own band, I'll admit, I was a little crushed. Then, I heard her new band. & HolyHell! I'm very picky when it comes to music, but The Pretty Reckless is easily my new favorite band and have been for the past 8 months. It's one thing to be amazing in a studio, it's another to completely rock LIVE. I saw The Pretty Reckless last year @ Warped Tour and they surely did not disappoint. I was in pure awe of Taylor's voice. Not to mention the fact that the guys in her band actually know how to play!    There is not one song on Light Me Up that I don't absolutely LOVE. All the songs are amazing. From the title song \\"Light Me Up\\" to their first single \\"Make Me Wanna Die\\" to the haunting \\"You\\".     This CD will NOT disappoint you. & I cannot wait for the next!
0061564893|1.0|This book is a flipped pyramid.  The whole construction stands (?)on very unsure-unverified (maybe) facts (well, no, there isn't any).  Each hypothesis get used in the next chapter as an evidence to prove (?) other hypothesis which again are presented as evidences for the next one...  I'ts a circular mythomaniac way of thinking.  Very-very dispointing, because when questions are indeed valuable....author's answers are so poorly built-up that it destroys the validity of the question itself.  Avoid it as History book.  Read it as a novel.
B002AGIEYG|5.0|This 3 CD set, featuring the complete symphonies of Brahms with Sir Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic, has received lots of unreserved praise from musicians everywhere.  But I would have you to know that there are some things about this album that you may want to avoid.<br /><br />What are those things?  Well, if you are someone who doesn't want your emotions to come to the surface, this is a set that will force them to the top.  What's perhaps worse, it will have you thinking so deeply about your past and the meaning of your life that you will have to stop all that you're doing to take it all in.  Furthermore, the effect it will have on you will take days to wear off, if it does at all.  If you don't like thinking deeply, this CD will make you do so.  It's for these reasons that I can't recommend these discs to everyone.<br /><br />If the things laid out in the previous paragraph seem uninviting, I would beg you to reconsider.  I don't think there are many things more satisfying for the listener than music that leads us to into serious reflection--reflection that is never ponderous but rather seeks to uplift the soul of the listener through its searching.  In this day and age, music that has the potential to be life changing should be greeted with cries of adulation, at least that's how I feel.<br /><br />Now that I've hopefully whetted your appetite for what this disc is all about, I want to look just a bit deeper into the interpretation.  I think that Brahms is a composer whose charm lies not in excitement and pomp.  If these are the reasons for which one turns to Brahms, they will meet with disappointment.  You might as well listen to Tchaikovsky or Mahler.  When the interpreter's primary concern is foot-tapping excitement in Brahms, the music becomes a blurred mess of exaggerated sentimentality.  But what I think is unique in Brahms' symphonies is the amount of soul-searching thoughtfulness that is present.  Throughout the bars of the ingenious works, there lies a large dosage of retrospection that is probably rivaled nowhere else in the entire field of music.<br /><br />Rattle catches on to this.  With what has got to be the world's greatest orchestra, he opens the ears of us listeners to a world of tremendous beauty and depth.  It's really tough to pin down exactly how he does it, as his interpretive gifts allow him to give us a wide palate of sound. The music ranges from moments of a tenderness that almost floats to moments of gripping tragedy.  Each of the 4 symphonies has its own world and Rattle's vision takes this into account.  Never fear, you'll hear plenty of fate in the 1st and 4th symphonies while still hearing the blissful contentment that thrives in the 2nd and the autumnal feel for color in the 3rd.  But Brahms is always Brahms, which means that the rich harmonic structure on which the symphonies are based will never leave.  So no matter the mood or color, Rattle will still shine in a world of dark gorgeousness which his Berliners know more about than anyone else.  It's really hard for me to say which symphony receives the best interpretation as they're all so fresh and imaginative.  From the refreshing beams of sunlight and pure joy in the opening of the 2nd to the throbbing drama at the end of the 4th, everything is captured so wonderfully.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, I want to clarify something.  While Rattle doesn't see Brahms as being about excitement and pomp, this does not mean everything is laid back and cozy.  In the process of unveiling the true world of Brahms, Rattle will give us exhilarating climaxes where the sheer bigness of sound gives me chills.  I have to think in particular of how he closes the 1st symphony.  The excitement is so contagious I have to fight to resist shouting from the thrill.  The point is that all the excitement is seen in perspective.  When we hear the closing of the 1st symphony, for example, it's only after we've been on a journey of where grief is unleashed in ways that may force you to pull your handkerchief out.  In fact, the pure triumph of the close of the symphony is ten times as inspiring after we've been on such a journey.<br /><br />In closing, there is no other music in my entire collection that I love as much as this set.  I don't think it's necessary for me to explain why you should buy it and give yourself the same experience.ashed in ways that may force you to pull your handkerchief out.

B003GEDLW6|5.0|There comes a time when everything just comes together the right way, and a band captures lightning in a bottle.  This album is that moment for Pendulum.<br /><br />Immersion is an EPIC release, and I fully believe that with the right promotion, it will eventually become the measuring stick against which other albums in the same genre will be measured.<br /><br />My personal favorite track:  Set Me On Fire.  The Island Part II is a very close second, Salt in the Wounds, the Vulture, and Self vs Self rounding out the rest of my favorites, although it's hard to knock any track on here, they are all incredible.<br /><br />I'm so glad I stumbled upon the video of the fat man dancing (Slam), because now I have a new favorite band!

B00068N5QW|5.0|This particular version has 2 extra bonus tracks, which makes it a 19 track CD.  It is a great buy for any Britney collector!  This CD really showcases Britney's best songs.  It's a great track-list and the album art and booklet are designed very well.  This is defiantly a great buy, and it's cheaper than the 17 track version.  I would recommend this to anyone!

I read this book on public transportation on my way to work for two days (that's all it took, two days) and laughed and cried, I couldn't help it. It was a birthday present from a dear friend who knew I would love it. A fantastic book for everyone, not just dog lovers!
B004NFB4EO|5.0|I'm amazed by the negative reviews here! This song is awesome. Yes, it is slightly contrived and possibly overly-hyped by Lady GaGa but it is still an INCREDIBLY alive dance tune and progressive anthem. Forget about the childish comparisons to any Madonna songs because \\"Born This Way\\" stands on its own as far as the beats, vocals and message. Lady G is surrounded by so much hype and so many distractions that her genuine talent is sometimes overlooked but I believe she is the real deal and will stand the test of time. This song is proof of good things to come.

The CD is the best that I have ever heard him. \\"Just Another Rider\\" is in my head in a big way.  Always a first class blues singer and musician, he's jaming with some top notch musicians as well.  When I heard the piano, I knew instantly that it was Dr. John.  I play this CD when I'm working and when I'm driving everyday, multiple times a day.  I feel like Gregg Allman is one of the guys that I grew up with.

It's both hilarious and terrifying how they couldn't get anybody to believe that everything was going to collapse, even though the evidence was right in front of them. The book has a strong narrative drive for the most part, though it kind of sags a bit in the middle as you're waiting for the inevitable collapse.

I thought it was kind of hokey, but Jimmy Stewart was so wonderful, the tone, the conflicts, the theme, the humanity of it so startling, I began watching it every year.  When it was no longer easy to find on TV, had to buy it.         A moving story with its roots solidly in fantasy, it still has some classic moments and absolutely top notch performances, especially Stewart's.  Oh, oh, oh, especially Stewart's.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|I play game cube and smash bros a lot, so I highly recommend the official controller. It is a little more expensive, but Nobody does it better than Nintendo. I purchased other cheaper controllers and either the analog stick moves by itself or the buttons stick. This controller does neither and it feels durable too. If you are expecting to play any hardcore Nintendo game look no further than the official controller, if you just want to play Wii or game cube with out really caring about the results of the game get a cheaper controller. But if you want to play Wii and game cube games without worry of the controller having issues buy this controller now!

I identify strongly with many other raters here such as my friend who recently noted that it pushed a button they didn't know they had\\".<br /><br />\\"Love You Forever\\" lovers; repent!  This book is not a signal of true familial love, nor are we, the protagonists of it's opposition the harbingers of moral decay in modern society.  This book, while no devil in itself, is symbolic of the unhealthy nature many people have toward thier growing/grown children when they fail to see that there are other things--maybe even more pressing things, than the absolutely imperative bond between parent & child.

B00003CX5P|4.0|I thought this movie was very good. It had good action, and the characters were acted well. Jar Jar Binks was very funny, and he and Qui-Gonn Jinn were one of my favorites. The animated characters were designed well. Padme talked in a kind of toneless way, but I think that was her \\"Queen voice.\\" The Chancellor was very \\"oily\\" in the way he talked-just like his real character. It is interesting to see everything planned out. Darth Maul was kind of creepy looking in a cool way with the facial tattoos.The battles were exciting, with the Gungan battle (Binks acting crazy, of course), and the battle planned by Queen Amidala and the diversion by Captain Panaka. Overall, this was a cute movie, with adventure and excitement.

0198326769|4.0|**SPOILER ALERT**  **SPOILER ALERT**  **SPOILER ALERT**                 As a student reading this book, I felt that the book displayed boundless friendship, deep emotions, and loss of innocence. To read a story told through the eyes of a nine year-old boy living in Auschwitz (or, \\"Out-With\\") during World War II is amazing and very interesting. This is an extraordinary novel in my opinion and anyone interested in the subject of the Holocaust will be deeply engrossed by this fictional story. The way the author presents Bruno and his family was outstanding, and the ending almost made me cry! Shmuel is a young Jewish boy living in a concentration camp who meets Bruno at the fence. Bruno is the son of an important German officer. Their friendship grows as Bruno and Shmuel meet at the fence every day. Even though most of the book displays loss, their friendship adds a little bit of happiness to the story. This is an amazing novel and I encourage all students,or anyone really, to read it.
B003UESJH4|4.0|In this great film, perhaps the most stirring of the year, we see in every scene, both humorous and dramatic, one truth, displayed with such depth and elegance it seemed the viewer might lose his seat and enter the tale himself.<br /><br />For the first time in a drama this year, we have perfection.<br /><br />Over and over again, films have tried to find the delicate balance between pure entertainment and drama mired in its own dreariness, but until now it had been in vain.<br /><br />This film confronts that conflict, confronts and overcomes, with Geoffrey Rush more than meeting the challenge of a role which, when played so well, captures humor, civility, and great emotional depth.<br /><br />He is an actor who demands respect in every role he portrays be it a swarthy pirate or a master of elocution, who succeeds not with good looks but with great vision, his subtlety reaching a transcendent state.<br /><br />Such a man, stripped of all devices, would surely produce a poignant performance in his own right, but when this man stands beside Colin Firth, the grandeur of the character and of The King's Speech entire becomes much greater.<br /><br />But there is far more than just the acting, for the film deserves acclaim in every facet; from writing to extensive costume and set production, to direction and cinematography, to editing and music, its qualities know no end.<br /><br />Examples are ultimately what sway us.

B000002KIQ|5.0|A great collection of songs done in a unique style.  These are mostly instrumental numbers of which my favorites are three exquisite gospel instrumental songs that sound like a cross between a street corner Salvation Army band and New Orleans jazz. The Ry Cooder vocals are also wonderful.
B000001FQ4|3.0|The evolution of Thin Lizzy is one of the least looked at phenomonon in Rock history.  How did the band go from a funky, folky Eric Bell single guitar (and very good too) band to the great sound of the twin guitars of Lizzy. This album is the missing link of that evolution. As mentioned by many other capable reviewers, there are some jazzy soft songs and a few rockers - Philomena combines both and is the best song on the album. The main question is how did they move from this album to the Fighting/Jailbreak era of major chord guitar rock solo's and driving lyrics?<br /><br />I wish we can find out where Nightlife came from as it really doesn't fit in the Lizzy line-up.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has an amazing voice. Nothing like anything else out there. She's in a class all by herself. I love jazz/blue has young, viberant energy. Looking forward to furture recordings.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|In 21 Adele writes and sings as if she's lived a lifetime over. Her breathtaking lyrics, powerful melodies and stripped back power pulls at the deepest wells of human emotion. It's amazing she can pull something like this off when writing the songs at twenty-one years of age. I can't wait to see what else she provides us with 25.<br /><br />Adele's 21 is the  sophomore album from British singer-songwriter that I've eagerly anticipated since her debut album, 19.<br /><br />This new collection of songs solidifies her standing as one of my favorite vocalists. But even though it is still Adele's already signature style, the album takes on a different vibe than the first. Rather than a more jazzy standards feel that the first album had, this new album has a more bluesy, gospel, old-school country feel to it to which I cannot stop listening.<br /><br />Her vocals are sheer perfection. There is the power and emotion throughout the songs that make them resonate strongly with you. But apart from her vocal style and penetrating tone, the strength of her songwriting shines through across all the tracks on this album. It's unbelievable to me that she is able to write such poignant songs of anguish, heartache, love and joy at her age.<br /><br />Adele has managed to construct a wonderful album with amazing tracks from beginning to end. \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" has this wonderfully powerful and soulful track where you can completely relate to that moment when you catch someone in their deceptive ways. \\"Someone Like You\\" will give you chills as the emotion is written across every last note of Adele's vocal. The percussive quality of \\"Rumor Has It\\" makes it a great bluesy track, and \\"Take It All\\" left the most lasting impression on me through its basic truth and rawness. Even \\"Lovesong\\" is different enough from the original while holding true to the essence of the song to make it an extremely successful cover.<br /><br />This album has only seemed to get better with every listen. I've had it on repeat since I've downloaded it on iTunes and I haven't found a bad track in the bunch.<br /><br />Rating: A+it on iTunes and I haven't found a bad track in the bunch.    Rating: A+
B003RNXIBK|4.0|All I have to say is I hate the hip-hop \\"game\\" where it is now. Its more of an act than music. I stick to underground music or listen to atmosphere, Murs, Eyedea, KRS1 Etc. . . With that said this music is back to the real EMINEM the one real people liked not the High school trend music. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars instead of 5/5 is because Lil Wayne is on one of the tracks. Before you buy it go listen to \\"25 to life\\". That song is deep and it has a message about the current music industry.    MakeSmartCool.Com
0439023513|5.0|There is a lot of heated discussion surrounding this book.<br /><br />The negative reviews tend to focus on things I really don't think should have been changed.  For one, this is a war book, so that means there is bound to be strategy, violence, injuries, death, risk, and emotional and mental trauma--which are the worst injuries of any war because they last.<br /><br />For another, people complain because Katniss is not more involved. I think that's ridiculous. She's 17, she has PTSD and is unstable, and though she is brave and smart, she is ONLY ONE PERSON in a cast of many brave, smart people.  I disagree with the need readers feel to have the main protagonist involved in every major plot point, to be the catalyst behind most of the action.  This is a book about realism. Plausibility.  And also, manipulation.  This isn't a book about straight-forward action or honest people doing obvious things. This isn't a story about a 17 year old leading in an adult world or about an unrealistic woman with an immunity to fragility as so many readers want these days.<br /><br />Another thing people dislike about the book is the despair and hopelessness compared with the fragile, breakable hope at the end.  They don't think this is strong enough.<br /><br />My complaint about their complaints is that these readers have never known trauma. They don't know what it's like to break, to be bereft of rational thought and reduced to instinctual reactions, for example.<br /><br />I do.<br /><br />I think this book does an excellent job doing what it does.  I think if they want to read something else, they should just admit that the author won't tailor to what they want. She's writing the story about these people in this situation. Everything that happens is plausible within that set of rules.<br /><br />If you don't like the book just say so, instead of trying to explain why it is the author's fault you don't like it.  Take responsibility for your own likes or dislikes (types of stories, characters, plots, worlds), take responsibility for things you don't understand (like depression, PTSD, war, etc.).  Suzanne Collins didn't do a rush job, nor is she stupid, she just wrote something you happen not to like.r things you don't understand (like depression, PTSD, war, etc.).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Let's just say first off I am a mid 20's male which probably isn't the target audience but the idea of death games captivated me to buy this book and I am glad I did. I read the first book in 2 days the second one in about 5 days because of work and the third one in another 2. I am a fan of anything different, I really like the idea of anything paranormal (wizards, vampires, dragons, etc.) but I hate all of the modern day vampire stories coming out (vampire meets girl and falls in love with said girl) don't get me wrong the Twilight series was a decent book series and worth a read ever from my perspective probably a 3 star book series, and the Harry Potter series still lives as the best thing I have ever read, they were for sure a 5 star book. However my rating is for this series. And I gave it a 5 stars because it was better than a 4 even though I don't think it was quite a 5 star book series I would have probably more accurately given it an 8.5 or 9 out of 10. The story was straight forward it was love story without being a love story.  I mean don't get me wrong the girl went 95% crazy after the first book which I think was part of the books greatness. If your like my wife and I the whole series we could only thing Gale sucks Peeta is better but that was just us personally. Also we are from the Appalachian Mountains in the heart of coal country which was part of what I liked about the book as well. Overall it was a bit of everything that made this book great, it was futuristic but totally relatable. I loved the series and it is the first series of books I have read since the Harry Potters that I highly recomend to everyone I know.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I love 21.  It's a great album from start to finish.  21 is a perfect sequel for Adele, and serves as further proof that her music cannot be \\"genre-ized\\".  I admit I cheated a little and got the british version, which was released before the U.S version.  But I just didn't want to wait more than I had to.  Adele has definitely grown up since 19.  Her story telling abilities really come out more in this album than they did in the last.      Rolling in the Deep is the lead song, and quite frankly it's the best on 21.  But don't assume that it's the only good song here, far from it.  I particularly liked \\"Roumor has It\\" which I though was very catchy and just plain fun.  \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" is a very good song that provides a perfect example of just power strong Adele's voice really is.  I appreciated the fact that Adele is able to sing without the use of a lot of background noise to make her sound good; a lot of the songs on this album are just here and a guitar or her and a piano.   These songs tend to be more personal for her, so it seems.  Songs like \\"Love Song\\", \\"Hiding My Heart\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" are attest to this as they are perfectly tender.    21 is a great album.  But, I suggest you get the deluxe version when it comes out.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, it's a great story line....until the end, it just drops off, very unsatisfying. There had better be a sequel, I don't like being left hanging.

B000002N3J|5.0|I originally bought this album on tape cassette, but it had to be replaced recently due to a deterioration in sound quality. As no music shops stocked it anymore, AMAZON.COM came to my musical rescue. Suffice to say, the CD version sounds as fresh as ever!!
1400052173|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is non-fiction account of the life and family of a poor, uneducated, thirty-one year African-American woman who contracted a rapidly metastasizing cancer and died in 1951.     Before her death, a portion of her tumor was removed and scientists grew her cells in culture. Her cells were unusual inasmuch as they had qualities that made them uniquely valuable research tools. These first successful growth of cells became famed the HeLa cells, that are still being used today for medical research. Ms. Lacks and her family knew nothing about this taking and using of her cells and were never asked for their consent or ever given any compensation for the use of her cells.     This fascinating and memorable book details the sordid story of what happened to Ms. Lacks and to her family's reaction to this knowledge once they learned of this research.    Rebecca Skloot has written a thoroughly fascinating book which takes the esoteric subject of medical research and intertwines it with history, race, ethics and poverty. It's a wonderful story that immortalizes Ms. Henrietta Lacks beyond the laboratory; this story memorializes her contribution to medicine and science.  This book a powerful testimony that's well worth reading.

You can really lose yourself in Mac's world, fall in love with Barrons himself, and wish that the series will never end. When I finished the 5th book (in one sitting, no less), I was so sad that I immediately went back and re-read the whole thing again on my Kindle. Sure, there were repetitions from one book to another, but really, Jericho Barrons? (sigh!)...now that's a man any woman can fall in love with!!

0061438294|5.0|This book is really amazing. It details all of our humans bodily movements that would otherwise go un-noticed.<br />Joe Navarro gives you the edge on reading persons behavior and what they are really thinking or what is really going on inside their head. A knee shaking may not only mean they had a bit of coffee. It may resemble a tad more.<br />This book offers insight into so much of our instinctive humanly behavior it will blow your mind and you'll love it.
B00192IV9U|2.0|You have the chance to have some new songs, finished or not, of Michael Jackson. Whether or not he would have been pleased with the results is completly irrelevant here.     Don't you see?    Michael was a great artist. He was known to be very meticulous about the technical aspect of his material. Well then, you have a chance with this new CD to take a trip inside his brain, inside his creativity. You have a chance to witness some of his unfinished work. To see how the mind of a genious works is a blessing for anyone who is a fan of that genious. Don't see it as a travesty or anything like that. See it as a chance to appreciate what was intended to be.     Wouldn't you like to listen to an unfinished song from, let's say, John Lennon? See an unfinished painting of Picasso? Listen to an unfinished piece of music from Mozart? Now, even if someone else would take that unfinished piece of art and finish it, so what? You know it's not \\"the real thing\\" so you simply have to appreciate it for what it is. See it as an hommage if you want to.     The songs \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" and \\"Monster\\" are pure gems! Who cares if somebody else sings! Who cares if it sounds different than what Michael would have done! It is still a trip inside part of his mind. It is still a glimpse of what might have been. And it is done by talented artists who knew Michael and worked with him. Therefore, they knew a little bit where Michael wanted to go with those demos. Surely, it cannot be \\"that far\\" from what might have been if Michael would have had the chance to finish them.    Christ! You even hear Michael sing part of a song on his phone. What more do you want?     Would you rather not hear any of the demos he had in mind? Again, I know those songs aren't the \\"real thing\\". But i'm glad i get to have the choice to decide if i want to listen to them or not.     I decide to appreciate this CD for what it is. A voyage into the mind of Michael Jackson, a chance to hear what he had in mind. And the chance of hearing other artists pay hommage to him by putting what they think is the final touch to his unfinished work.    To not want that is incomprehensible to me. Especially if you're a fan.

0670022411|5.0|Diana Bishop is from one of the most powerful witch families known to exist, and she may be one of the family's most powerful witches ever. But she goes out of her way not to practice magic. She has become a well-known scholar in the fields of history and science, in particular the intersection of science and witchcraft. And while she might not practice magic intentionally, she's aware of it all around her.    While doing research in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, Diana recalls a manuscript, Ashmole 782, that has been considered lost for the last 150 years. Finding it bound by a spell, she breaks it unknowingly; once the book is open, she can't say why, but something about it is all wrong. Slightly shaken by her discovery and the magic, she sends the book back to the stacks, bothered by its contents and the influx of witches, daemons and vampires that have suddenly gathered in her vicinity. Unsettled by what she has seen, Diana leaves the library and plans to forget the book, hoping that the attention from the other creatures will fade as well.    Matthew Clairmont is a pioneering researcher known for his work in the genetics field. He is also a vampire looking for a way to get his hands on the manuscript, and he thinks he may have found that way through Diana. What Matthew doesn't expect is to fall in love with her while looking for the book. Diana is an enigma to Matthew --- not only does she appeal to him both intellectually and physically, he stuns even himself when he can't walk away from her even when he should.    Diana and Matthew find themselves in an unorthodox relationship, and because of it, they are being hunted by the Congregation, a group of witches, daemons and vampires that rule the world of creatures. They are in danger not just from the discovery of Ashmole 782, but also from their growing relationship. Knowing Diana will never be able to defend herself without knowledge of and control over her powers, Matthew convinces her they must go to her family for help. Safe with Diana's family of witches, they try to understand what her connection is to the manuscript and why every vampire, witch and daemon is after it.    I love books about books. Throw in witches, daemons and vampires, and it appears I become very easy to please. Deborah Harkness throws a lot into her novel --- witchcraft, love, vampires, daemons, secret covens, lost spell-bound books --- but she makes it all work, and very smoothly at that. It works thanks to the characters. Diana and Matthew are more than just witch and vampire, and it's about more than spells and bloodlust. While I'm not always a huge fan of love stories mixed with fantasy tales, it works very well here and manages to become the story without overwhelming it.    Matthew's history combined with Diana's research lend the novel a fantastic scope that spans generations, but the science Harkness infuses into the story grounds it so that it never feels as if it goes off on a strange tangent. There are explanations for the witchcraft as well as background for the hidden lives of the creatures (witches, vampires, daemons and humans) that make the story feel less fantastic and more realistic. Well, as close as one can get to real in a story about creatures that don't exist.    A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES is the first book in the All Souls trilogy. I for one will be waiting anxiously for the next two volumes in the series.         --- Reviewed by Amy Gwiazdowski

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|This is a very refreshing straight forward bluesy rock album. They have a great chemistry and it shows! Glenn Hughes still has the voice! This is probably one of the best rock masterpieces put out in quite a few years! These guys complement each other's playing very well.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I've been following this series from season one and what I love most is how strong the writing, acting and directing is. There's never an inconsistency and even their most tame episode is still entertaining. I really love how the storyline is a mixture of humor, horror, action, suspense and just the right amount of drama. Everyone I've shown this series to has fallen in love with it and that's because it's one of the best TV shows ever made.<br /><br />I also love how the writers have to guts to actually \\"go there\\". They went there when they killed the father. They went there when Dean sold his soul for Sam. They went there when Dean had to go to hell. They went there when the Devil was released and then they went there with the ending of this season too. They don't pull punches and they don't make it easy for the two lead characters. The storylines are always rich, the dialogue is amazing and the two men are hot. What more can you ask for?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|WOW.....Fantastic.   Adele's voice is insane.  She really can sing.  We need more like her.  This is an album to check out if you love a good soulful and huge voice.

She doesn't sound 21 at all.  She is very wise for a 21 year old, she must be an old soul.   Check this girl out.  WOW!!!!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Summer Wars isn't exactly a new theme for anime, or movies in general.  It's the sometimes trite and mostly overused boy meets girl meets problem = awww <3.  That out of the way it is an original it is beautiful and it is a fantastically well done take on a tired theme.  I'm not going to delve into the actual plot, as there are plenty of other reviews that do so...as such please consider this a spoiler free review.    The DVD comes with some small cards of characters you will meet in the anime, a beautiful box, and a second disk of extras, previews, and other bits of information on Summer Wars.  It's a nice way to handle the issue of adding extra content, a separate disc is far preferable to wading through the menus.  The subtitling is done very well and is never obtrusive nor does it move so quickly that you're distracted from actually watching the anime.  That in and of itself is often a difficult task to achieve with subtitles and they should be lauded just for that fact.    The graphics are beautiful and the color palette is massive.  The change between the real world and OZ is a phenomenal example of this as things become brighter, the colors less natural and more deeply hued, and yet it all seems natural as if you could login to OZ today and create your own avatar.  In the real world the saturation and blending is most apparent with the backgrounds, sunsets, sunrises, fields, and cities are richly animated and nothing feels like an afterthought.  It is no wonder that this series won so many awards, just based on the art alone it is an epic achievement.       The story of Summer Wars has more to do with family, cooperation, and faith in your fellow human being than the actual goings on of OZ.  Each character is well developed, though some are more distinct than others.  You can tell that the creators took each individual character very seriously and tackled subjects that may otherwise be difficult to handle.      Your main characters are a painfully shy high school student who has never kissed a girl and is focused on math, a young lady unsure of where she is in the world and desperate to please her grandmother, uncle, and other relatives even if that means lying.  The grandmother is a proud matriarch of a respected but now (comparatively) penniless family who has lived a life of conviction, clearly holding her clan together.  Others include bombastic uncles, snotty aunts, overly inquisitive young children, a quiet loner of a child with a secret revealed halfway through the anime, and an uncle who fills the role of being the titular black sheep.      It's a big cast that would be easy to lose track of if you weren't introduced to them so thoroughly and if they weren't all distinct.  It's a feat that Summer Wars manages to keep everything together so well throughout the entire show.      Summer Wars is a very family oriented anime in that it is based around a family, and the \\"family\\" of a world connected all the time through OZ (a much evolved Internet).  It reflects that while we may want to solve our problems alone, hide our pain and worries from the world, and share only what makes us seem the best - we can't solve anything that way and we must learn to communicate.  This is a timeless message that still comes across fresh in Summer Wars and is endearing if just for the way it is presented to us.
0316098337|5.0|I love books that I cannot put down. This is one of them. So different, so good. I loved the concept and the depth of this book. Well done. A must read!
0061689246|2.0|First of all I don't think this book is appropriate for children under 16...I think 16 is questionable, so I'm not sure why this book was published by Harperteen.  The description of Tristran's conception was inappropriate and the intimate detail was not a necessary part of the story line.  Also this is an almost singular case of watching the movie before reading the book, and 99% the book is always better, sadly this is not the case with this book.  In my opinion, most of the changes made for the movie would have greatly enhanced the book.  I'm not going to go into an depth review as there are numerous others that have already done so.
0316174483|5.0|I got this book for my daughter for christmas and she loves it! It seems simple, but it has been a great creative and fun past time for my 5 year old. She can sit there and make \\"thumbies\\" for hours. Its a great family craft that everyone can do even if you cant draw or can serve as a fun past time for your children to do on their own. The best part is that it is a very good price!!! Thumbies gets 2 thumbs way up!  :D

B0018AK9RA|2.0|Nothing special and i can say that this is a bad album. Its one of the worst they have ever released. This album has no similarities to other Judas Priest albums. Its more progressive than heavy. I don't want a fates warning album i want a judas album. But the bad thing in this concept is thet there are no tracks to like at all. Only Nostradamus is between 3-4 stars . the other tracks are terrible. If the singer wasn't Halford then i would have rate this album 1 star.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I can only echo the other good reviews for this item.  Great sound quality, very small and versatile and the remote provides plenty of control options.  I chose this model over the one priced about $5 less because it could recognize more folders 99 versus 20 (which allows reading of up to 1,999 files); had a display that was useful and is reported to have a better randomization of songs.
B0007KVAVG|4.0|Yes this album is the Judas Priest of today. Very good songs and it becomes one of the good albums they have ever released. Its more heavy than the old (It reminds you more Halford than Judas Priest ) but its very good. My favourite tracks are Lochness (amazing chorus) Angel (a very good ballad) Eulogy (amazing slow and quality song) Revoluton (classic Priest song). The other songs are also good. A must for Priest fans and generally a very good metal album for any metal fan

0802130208|4.0|A few weeks ago, a reader commented and suggested that as part of my book reviews, I acknowledge first and foremost what my expectations of each book were before reading. Thus, I will begin this practice with A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole.<br /><br />At first glance, I must admit that I was ambivalent to this book. I was torn between the story behind the author, the brightly illustrated cover, the fact that this book was written in the latter-half of the Twentieth Century, and the fact that it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />First, there exists the intriguing and auspicious story regarding John Kennedy Toole and A Confederacy of Dunces. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969, at the age of thirty-two. In 1976, John's mother approached Walker Percy, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans, with the manuscript. Four years later, in 1980, the book was published and John was posthumously awarded Pulitzer Prize for fiction. More intriguing is the fact that John had written an earlier novel, at the age of sixteen, titled The Neon Bible. This book was one that John's mother Selma wished to remain unpublished; yet, after she passed in 1984, the rest of the family sued for the rights and, in 1989, The Neon Bible was published. Is it a good book? I have no idea, I have yet to read it; however, it does has a four-and-a-half-star rating on Amazon.com. Had John Kennedy Toole known he was sitting on a literary blockbuster, would he have still ended his life so early? Or, would he have continued to write?<br /><br />While JKT's life and the story of publication were intriguing and compelled me to read A Confederacy of Dunces, I was wary at the fact that it was awarded the Pulitzer. The last book I read that received such an \\"honor\\" was Oscar Wao. It was terrible. Therefore, I was expecting more political and sociological undercurrents in Dunces. Fortunately, these were not an issue.<br />The cover is brightly illustrated. The man on the cover wears a green hunting cap, a green scarf, and a red sports coat that is much too tight and is about to bust the top button. Atop this man's head is perched a yellow bird. In the background sits Bourbon Street. I had a great desire to know who this man was.<br /><br />Finally, I found myself again dreading the fact that I was reading contemporary literature. In one of his essays, C.S. Lewis advices both readers and aspiring writers to focus their efforts on well written books. In order to do this, Lewis advised reading only one contemporary piece for each five books read. So far, I have found this to be great advice and I routinely find myself disappointed with contemporary lit while pleasantly surprised with classic lit. Being that out of the previous ten books I read, three could definitely be classified as contemporary (Let the Great World Spin, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Methland), I found myself dealing with not only the anxiety of staring into the face of a poor ratio, but more pressing, staring into the face of two pretty bad books out of three. Fortunately, I was also reading I and Thou concurrently, which I figured more than offset the balance.<br /><br />A Confederacy of Dunces is truly a comic tragedy. This quirky narrative follows the life of one Ignatius J. Reilly through...well, really through a bunch of nothing. Ignatius is an intellectual who esteems himself to be better than the world around him and therefore, he does his best to remain uninvolved in that world. He spends most of his time reading Boethius and writing the next great commentary on the current state of the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Ignatius, Fortuna is out to get him. From the beginning of the novel, Ignatius finds himself at the butt end of a series of unfortunate events. First, he is haggled by a police officer simply for loitering in an arcade while his mother is shopping next door. This even causes a downward spiral in which Ignatius watches, from the backseat,as his mother plows the station wagon into a storefront while she is drunk. Having no income and faced with paying for the damages, Mrs. Reilly forces Ignatius to get a job. Fortuna continues to prey on Ignatius as he loses job after job all the while watching his world crumble around him.<br /><br />While reading Dunces it is easy to see that this is not so much a story concerning characters (all of whom are so far removed from any \\"normal\\" archetypes that it is difficult to form personal relationships with them) as it is a story concerning ideas and ideals. On page one, Toole writes the following:<br /><br />Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person's lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one's soul.<br /><br />Toole, through Reilly, is mourning the loss of the past. He sees in antiquity a world of great men and great ideas, a world of decency, an immaterial world where worth is measured in the depth of the human soul. Everything modern, to include canned food is \\"ultimately very damaging to the soul.\\"<br /><br />At every turn, Ignatius does his best to defy convention and rebel against the norm. At this he is successful, while demonstrating a complete lack of ability in every other facet of life. Unfortunately, this leaves the Ignatius a sad, lonely figure whom the reader can simply watch tumble further and further down:<br />for I mingle with my pees or no one, and since I have no peers, I mingle with no one.<br />However sad the book was, in total, I found myself slowing down as I neared the end, not wanting to leave the story behind. John Kennedy Toole produced a masterpiece and left it for the world: not quite comedy, not quite tragedy, but all quirk and one I can say with the confidence of someone who has read no other title from 1980* well-deserving of the Pulitzer for 1980<br /><br />*Other titles of note from 1980:<br />The Bourne Identity - Robert Ludlum<br />Midnight's Children - Salman Rushdie<br />The Covenent - James Michener<br />Battlefield Earth - L.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book lacked what the first two did in character development.  The ending was depressing and I was dissapointed in the main characters ability to be anything more than a broken shell of a person who did nothing except what everyone told her to.  I had nothing but good things to say about the other books but this one didnt live up to my expecations.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The whole series is amazingly captivating.  Yes, at times there are a lot of details, but I liked all the information. It does deal with some adult themes, so not really the best read for a young person.
B0035J6TAI|1.0|I've never felt compelled to write a review before but I feel in this case it is a public duty. I consider myself a huge Peter Gabriel fan but this CD has me questioning my loyalty. Is life so bad that everything gets turned into a funeral dirge? I was intrigued by the play list but PG mailed this one in. Hopefully he doesn't get hold of \\"Happy Birthday\\". Save your money.
B004MMEIK0|5.0|This book is ***Fantastic*** and so is the entire series.  When I read this I was thinking it would be just another Vampire story, I actually found myself  laughing and guffawing to the point my husband wanted to know what was going on.  This series is unique because it is about Vampire's and Shifters - you would expect lots of blood and gore etc., yet it is laden with contemporary humor and a little hot romance!  I can't recommend this Book #1 about Roman and Shanna enough. LOVE IT!!! Can't wait for Book 10...
B000002I99|4.0|Alice's first solo record was also his most successful as a solo artist, not to say it all went downhill from there but he never would again reach such heights. `Welcome to My Nightmare', album and tour, was an A plus production all the way with a cast of capable studio professionals helping to put together Alice's first road band after the split on the original band in early 1974.  Even horror legend Vincent Price makes an appearance as he introduces \\"Black Widow\\", something he would later do seven years later for Michael Jackson.  The title track and \\"Cold Ethyl\\" are two of the more notable tunes not forgetting Alice's most famous ballad in \\"Only Women Bleed\\" which established a pattern of similar attempts at balladry for the rest of the decade to lesser success than on \\"Bleed\\". The album also seems to be a loose concept record, especially for the ending suite beginning with \\"Years Ago\\" and ending with \\"Escape\\". Many of the other songs seem to deal with mental illness or depravity (which is different how from any of Alice's other LPs??). `Welcome to My Nightmare' does have its legion of fans among Alice supporters but I just don't consider it as good as `Love It to Death', `Killer' or `BDBs'. Still gotta love a man who enjoys his work and the Coop's sense of humor is intact throughout. I mean how can you take \\"Cold Ethyl\\" seriously? If \\"I Love the Dead\\" offended you then forget it!
1439181780|5.0|An amazing book! I can't decide which I like better, this one or The Secret. Definitely suggest this book to anyone who read The Secret!<br /><br />And Amazon shipped very fast to my Canadian address even though I selected the most basic shipping. Received it about a week before the predicted date when I first ordered.
0762761296|5.0|I heard that a movie is coming out so I had to read the book first before I went to see the movie. WOW what an excellent book and the story of this horrific experience those people went throe. Reading this book I just couldn't wait to flip to the next page it was this good. This has to be one of the best getaway's that have ever happened to a human kind. Read the book first before you see the movie. The movie doesn't even compare to the book. I take my hat down to the survivors.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|This remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE surprised me. It's actually better than the original! Sarah Butler is outstanding as the pivotal victim-turned-avenger. She is more believable and fierce than her predecessor. Though I was never sympathetic toward her attackers, their various demises did make me wince a couple of times, especially the \\"garden sheers\\" and \\"shotgun\\" scenes! Yikes! I still despise rape scenes, but at least they're more condensed in this version. As with the reboot of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, ISOYG 2010 is a fantastic update, and worthy of several viewings...
B0034G4OUY|5.0|I for one am happy The Rock has returned to what he does best - and with a role that is the darkest I have ever seen him go. Sony preserved this revenge flick on a nice BD that captures how this film is meant to be seen. Plot description is as simple as the headings given to us with each character introduction: no names, just titles. A driver who bleeds his way through a revenge fest whilst being chased by a neurotic assassin and a washed up cop.<br /><br />The picture quality has various fluctuations but that is how it was filmed. Several cameras use the yellow tint heavily, others show a deliberate grain. The flashy filming and action edit cuts can upset some viewers, but the overall quality makes this a great presentation. The DTS was mixed excellently throughout the film, whether it is the nice music score/soundtrack, or Rock throttling that beautiful car or that Ruger going off like the canon it is. The special features are a mixed bag:<br /><br />* Alternate ending, 12:35 minutes. Optional director introduction. A much more action-packed head-to-head ending that carried with it some major flaws, but worth the watch. Once they cut this out that led to all of the following scenes being cut...<br />* Deleted scenes, 10:43 minutes. All revolving around the change in how they present the ending and final twist(s). Moon Bloodgood got the shaft on this as these scenes were mostly hers, some of her grittiest acting to date. Director introduction to each is optional, with the menu manipulation making it somewhat amateurish in how they put it together (having to go backwards after each selection to actually see the scenes).<br />* Criminals/Cops, 12:05 minutes. Talking heads and clip heavy, only one or two decent insights.<br />* Guns, stunts, cars, 11:21 minutes. VERY worthy since it hits my three favorite topics in a film like this.<br />* Animatics, 12:15 minutes. Skip it. Is a storyboard mix of scenes, uninteresting.<br />* Movie IQ, the usual feature length trivia.<br /><br />Region coded A/B/C with English and Spanish subs only. If you are wondering where the big action scenes from the trailer and some of the cover art scenes went to - then you have to watch the alternate ending (as I was waiting for the big head-on scene the whole movie and never got it). Lots of complaining out there about this film and all the sub-plot character depth, but I enjoyed it and got past the leaps of disbelief in how some things go down, hope you enjoy a great Blu.h and Spanish subs only.

B000OCY7JE|5.0|This is a splendid and emotionally complex film.  There are quite a few unexpected turns in it.  A synopsis is available, so I won't bother giving one.  For those who are emotionally aware, mature and flexible, I highly recommend this film.  Good for fathers with daughters.
B0000028VT|3.0|Mariah, Mariah, Mariah. What a failure this album entailed, unfortunately, from Carey's previous endeavors. Singing the notes and stuff is one thing, but ephemeral poignant lyrics is another. Mixing in with the melodies and expressions of vocals simply isn't enough to satisfy me, because lyrics just stand out. That's just the way it is, and the way it always should be, if applicable.<br /><br />#1) Dreamlover- I never really liked this song to begin with. It's quite a positive outlook on captivation of a romantic partner, but the melodies just turn me away from the song. 3/5<br /><br />#2) Hero- Inner beauty and potential, what an encouraging song. 5/5<br /><br />#3) Anytime You Need A Friend- Uplifting reasonable track; anti-lonliness; I like the choir and Mariah's vocal crescendo. Lyrics are flawless. 5/5<br /><br />#4) Music Box- Perhaps the most outstanding track on this CD. Expression of gratitude of a lover in exhibited in its lyrics. This is quite a melancholy track, but it's very touching. 5/5<br /><br />#5) Now That I Know- The most upbeat that this album gets. Once again, this is a gratitude track. It's about being free to be who you are in a relationship. Even though you say that you want somebody for life, that's changeable. 5/5<br /><br />It's all downhill from here...<br /><br />#6) Never Forget You- I miss you! I miss you! A sad remininscing piece. 2/5<br /><br />#7) Without You- Weakened by love. Relative apprehension about near future. It's pathetic! 2/5<br /><br />#8) Just to Hold You Once Again- Another somewhat despondent track. It's about leaving someone (a romantic partner) and not being able to bear letting them go. 2/5<br /><br />#9) I've Been Thinking About You- It's about knowing someone for a while and getting ready to advance upon them; then realizing compatibility. Pretty uptempo, and attractive. But when \\"I'm falling in love with you\\" becomes repeated, it becomes less and less relatable. 3/5<br /><br />#10) All I've Ever Wanted- Brought tears to my eyes. That's how infectious it is, folks, but it seems to express lack of satisfaction. Get this: \\"If you were my own, to caress and hold...\\" and \\"Everything I do is for you; you are every part of me\\" in the same song; it sounds perplexing! 3/5<br /><br />Overall grade= 70%atisfaction. Get this: \\"If you were my own, to caress and hold...\\" and \\"Everything I do is for you; you are every part of me\\" in the same song; it sounds perplexing! 3/5    Overall grade= 70%
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has crafted a stunning album of songs that shows she just gets better with age.  Her vocals are sheer perfection.  There is no artifice or gimmicks--just power and genuine emotion.  Perhaps because she is a songwriter, Adele uses her ample singing ability to serve the lyrics of her songs.  She doesn't over do it like a Christina Aguilera, she tells her tales of heartbreak and redemption with conviction and integrity.  All the songs are fabulous. It's a great record that you can play from start to finish and just marvel at.  \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is a masterpiece of sass and soulful power.  \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" will give you chills--they are perfect.  Her jazzy take on \\"Lovesong\\" is a terrific cover--it changes the song just enough to warrant the cover, while leaving just enough of what people liked about the original.  \\"Rumour Has It\\" is percussive brilliance.  \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" is special for its ability to take some of Adele's retro soul and move it into a more modern sound.  \\"He Won't Go\\" continues the merging of Adele's sublime throwback soul power with a rhythmic R&B sound reminiscent of the very best Mary J. Blige.  \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" is a wonderfully surprising upbeat number that really works. The production on the album is flawless--it never suffocates the emotion and vitality of the songs.  This album gets better and better with every listen.    What sets Adele apart from all of the big voiced divas out there is exemplified on \\"21.\\"  She doesn't hide behind a gimmick, superfluous melisma, or bland tunes.  Adele seems game for taking what she does best and moving it in different directions.  She isn't tied to doing just old school soul, she pushes herself to be more creative.  She found all this at 21.  I can't wait for \\"25.\\"
B003UESJH4|5.0|Frankly, I did not think that a presentation of the speech difficulties that a person needs to overcome would make interesting viewing. However, the hype over this film encouraged me to see it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the story and the acting. The film also presented some interesting drama, such as the scene where the man who is helping the king overcome his stuttering seems to be a fraud; where his wife, who did not know that he was helping the king, came into her dining room and found the queen of England sitting at her dining room table; the man using psychology to overcome or at least mitigate the stuttering problem; and the revelation that the woman that King Edward wanted to marry, Simpson, was sleeping with other men and received flowers daily from Nazi Germany. All of the acting was excellent with the possible exception of the actor playing Winston Churchill who appeared to be a caricature of this great man.
B0000844IT|5.0|i love this movie!<br />unlike what the \\"professional\\" review says this movie is great! it doesn't take itself too seriously and you shouldn't come to it for a \\"horror\\" experience. it is FUNNY! i STILL quote it! my GF who usually only goes for chick-flicks enjoyed it and ALSO quotes it!!
B000LTAY1U|3.0|Bought the Seiko knowing full well what it is, a cheap automatic watch without hacking or stem-winding abilities.  It's worked great, not as accurate as a certified chronometer, but more than enough as it cost a fraction of my other watches.    The seller, Katarina, started sending me spam and asking me to join their Facebook page and such.  First time that has ever happened to me buying from Amazon and I don't like it.    Update:  Based on comment asking me not to downgrade watch for seller.  In short, I didn't, the watch is a three star watch, okay, but not great.  For the price it is fine, but I won't say it is a five star watch because it isn't.  It is a great beater watch that I won't care about it I break or damage it unlike my nicer ones.
B004498KPU|4.0|Since I'm late catching up with all things of Michael Jackson, this collection of his work helps me to not have to buy many others packaged separately. Most of his work, but not all, is here and a great collection to have all in one place for a fan getting caught up collecting Michaels vids. This is not everything I know he has done more than this and I will probably purchase a few other items to make the collection more complete. I must say that I feel the 3rd DVD in this set is not necessary for me. I purchased Michael's work only and not the \\"Jackson's\\" or his Nephews work. I don't care for Say, Say with Paul McCartney and the last vid that is supposed to be new by Michael all you see is the back of him mostly. Which I guess was his intent but not enjoyable to me like the first and second DVD in the set.    I also see the 3rd DVD as a way for his family to get their hands on some of the money from this set. Why include the Jackson's & his nephews in Michael's exclusive collection as a solo artist except to get the \\"family\\" in there so they get a piece of the pie. To me Disc 3 is not necessary at all. I also don't like the \\"prison\\" version of \\"They don't care about us\\". Even though it has a statement saying before it is played it isn't meant to be offensive to any race, etc. well to me it was very offensive. So that is not my favorite version of this song at all. And this is the reason I rated it with a 4 instead of 5. I purchased \\"Michael's\\" solo work. Not the work of others.    I do love the first 2 Discs and I have little collected so far since I'm getting caught up with Michael's work. So I am very happy to have this to get my little collection started for now. He is a \\"one of a kind\\" performer who's talent was simply amazing. You just don't see talent like his come by very often. A person who was so very uniquely gifted. He was a Masterpiece for sure. He will be greatly missed and I wish I would have caught on sooner to the talent that was before me all thoseyears I was very busy with life. Now I have time and now I'm catching up and so very sorry that now that I can see the amazing talent he had now that it's too late. Wish I would have seen and understood sooner but life gets very busy. I recommend this product to any avid fan of Michael's despite Disc 3. It's still worth it.

0393338959|4.0|Many people I know think Joseph Stiglitz is the modern incarnation of Karl Marx hiding out at Columbia University, but I found this book to be a very modest, balanced introduction to the causes of the recent economic meltdown, and it offers compelling solutions to it.  Don't get me wrong- Milton Friedman and his disciples are excoriated here, and Keynes is held aloft like a Greek idol, but I did not get the \\"Statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics\\"-effect from this book that I thought I might from an unabashed far-left economist. Everything seems sensible, and the chapters that explain in plain language the intricacies of derivatives, credit default swaps, mortgage securitization and the role of all the players are excellent. The big gripe I have with Stiglitz in this book is that be basically excuses the role of \\"Main Street\\" middle-income consumers in the gross profligacy that was 2003-2008. It's all the \\"big bad corporations'\\" and the \\"politically-compromised government's\\" fault, and the poor little average Americans were just hoodwinked into buying Lexuses on credit cards and accepting 100% financing mortgages that gave them monthly payments of over 50% of their net income. C'mon! However, for a good overall assessment of what happened with a heavy dose of Keynesian solutions, this is a good start. Now, if I could only find a decent free-market book about this mess... Any suggestions?

0670022411|4.0|This book was very well written.  It had great descriptions that some people may find distracting or \\"fluffy\\" but I thought added a lot of texture to the story.  The book kept me riveted and I couldn't wait to find out what happened at the end.  Unfortunately, I wasn't aware that this was going to be book one of a series.  If I had known, I probably would have waited for at least the 2nd book to come out.<br /><br />This story had great chemistry, pun intended, between the characters and in a historical sense.  Near the end, as you start realizing there is no way it is going to be resolved, there are a few more interesting characters introduced.<br /><br />I can't wait for the second book, but I have a feeling that by the time it comes out I am going to have forgotten most of the important details that were mentioned in this one.
0786868724|5.0|This was a heartwarming story about how completely different people can see religion in opposite ways but still have one thing in common - that they all believe in God.

B0042RUMEQ|4.0|I'll start by saying I love Nicki Minaj.<br /><br />The reason I bought this album as opposed to the digital version was the track with Will.i.am -- which was only available on the album version.  I thought it was kind of a lame move on the record labels' part, but music is just as good.<br /><br />Moment 4 life is currently my favorite song, on the album and in general.  I highly recommend the single, if not the full album.

B000UJ48UO|3.0|Call me crazy, but I was really glad to see Private Lawrence blow away his rather less-than-pleasant drill instructor.  The way I see it, if you choose to join the military, than I guess you should allow yourself to put up with all that psychological and physical abuse.  But, I really doubt that that over-weight, less-than-cooperative, Private Lawrence wanted to be there.  He was obviously drafted into a world that over-weight people are not likely to just comply and keep up with everybody else.  So, his drill sergeant certainly singled him out to abuse and to turn everybody else against him.  The poor sap who was drafted into the military had no future to be proud of as an American.  So, killing his tormentor before killing himself was just poetic justice and a story with a reasonable happy ending.  I don't feel bad that the drill sergeant was killed.  In fact, I think it represents  the most justified kind of killing that makes sense of the Vietnam War.  It seems his only purpose was to train people to kill, and in the long run, do we really want sick people like that in our world?  Even after the war?<br /><br />The second half of this movie just dragged as a bunch of half-hearted soldiers are trying to defend themselves against a sniper that just basically ends up being a teenage Vietnamese girl who was taught to hate Americans by her people and by what she was exposed to by American soldiers.  We Americans had no business being there so I can't really support any soldier that shot and killed an innocent Vietnamese citizen. Not any more than I would care that one of us got killed trying to save ourselves.  We had no business being in Vietnam to our country's benefit.  And yet our own government sent us over there against our will, to kill. To become killers.  To have to kill our President's chosen enemy as if they were our own enemy, and to be rewarded for it.  If you kill a Vietnamese farmer trying to protect his family and defend his land, you earn a medal.  But at home, if we raise our voice or raise our fist to an over-zealous cop verbally intimidating us, we go to jail.  It makes no sense!  Does it?home, if we raise our voice or raise our fist to an over-zealous cop verbally intimidating us, we go to jail.  It makes no sense!  Does it?

B000063COX|5.0|My name is arjun kaul.<br /><br />INTRO<br />I've been a maiden fan since 1988. The first time I heard \\"Moonchild\\" from Seventh Son, I thought I was going to lose my mind. The music was just so powerful. I remember my cousin putting on a show for the family where he'd call everyone to the room with the record player, give me a tennis raquet and then play this song. I would of course go into a maniacal frenzy playing this \\"sports guitar\\" and feeling the energy. Anyways back to the review.<br /><br />PRELUDE<br />I have a background in both performance and production. I'm a member of a touring hard rock band \\"prithvi\\" that has played hundreds of shows and I personally sing and play lead guitar. i also play drums, keyboards and bass when required. I have also produced a lot of music in a wide variety of genres including but not limited to rock/metal, house, funk, blues etc. I have sung a lot of Maiden and predominantly stuff from Bruce's era. I don't mean to brag but I have been able to nail all of Bruce's material quite comfortably. This is just to give you a reference point of where this review is coming from. I've been singing long enough to know what a good singer is. A good singer is someone who 'sings' well and expresses the song 'expressively'. That said let's get into the review.<br /><br />REVIEW<br />This is in my opinion the best record Iron Maiden ever made. If you watch \\"The History of Iron Maiden\\" there's a good commentary on the making of this album and you'll know why its probably their artistically most faithful album. It was recorded while they were touring hard across the UK doing 2 to 3 gigs a night, traveling in the back of a modest van.<br /><br />Production: The production is good. Period. Everything is well recorded and you can every single note and nuance very clearly. This is unlike their later records which IMO were ridiculously over produced with tons of EQ, compression and other effects. The sound is warm and has a good round analog feel to it. It doesn't sound bad at all. A lot of reviewers have bashed the production quality on this album. I'd like to respectfully submit that they didn't now what they were talking about. I believe they're rating this from the perspective of the kind of production that ruined maiden's sound in the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />Songwriting: Very good. yes 'Phantom of the Opera' is the outstanding track. IMO the signature Iron maiden song. Doesn't sound like anything but Iron maiden. You can easily tell aces High is very similar to sections of 2112 by rush and similarly a lot of their other songs are super close to stuff by UFO which of course Steve Harris was influenced by. This song (POTO) sounds very original. Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. 'Sanctuary' is also excellent. The melodic mid section is completely unexpected and gorgeous.<br /><br />Performance: Steve Harris's most dexterous bass work can be found on this album. Some of Dave Murray's best solos as well. Clive Burr has consistently been good on all his work with maiden. His drumming on Phantom is extraordinary. Very hard to replicate and Nicko McBRain plays a simplified version of it live. You can see for yourself. Enough has been said about Paul's singing on this album. Its soulful and powerful at the same time. His singing also has a lot of variation. I think if Paul stayed with maiden, they would've been as famous as Queen. They would have had similar variety.<br />Important: This is the best maiden album for vocal harmony. Example 'phantom'. Its a lot more punchy and natural than the forced vocal harmonies sin later albums. Good work by Steve Harris again on this.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />This is the REAL Iron Maiden. Their best studio work. Honest, creative and from the gut. Thanks for reading and feel free to connect with me.<br /><br />I'm on youtube as arjunkaul the king of rocknrollit.

B002ZG97EC|2.0|WAITING TO SEE THIS, AND VERY DULL, NOT FUNNY, NOT SURE KIDS WOULD EVEN LAUGH AT IT. JUST DRY AND DRUG OUT.
0451450523|5.0|I have seen (and read) three types of fairytale fantasy published in the last century. The first is like Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles: it is clever at the expense of fairy tales, mocking (usually gently) the tropes of the genre, often through metafictional techniques. This type does little for me. The second is like most of Patricia McKillip's work: it takes those same tropes completely seriously and (if done well, as in McKillip's case) reminds us why the tropes exist in the first place, because they have width and depth and resonance. This is one of my favorite branches of fantasy. The third is the rarest, because it's the most difficult: it goes beyond the form of the fairytale and into archetypal territory, quite literally writing myth.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn is all three of these.<br /><br />That is probably fitting, given that it is one of the classics in the genre. Being three things at once, it left me with a sense of. . . unevenness, though to be fair that sense came only in retrospect; Beagle's prose is gorgeous and sure, and I devoured the book in two large gulps then wished there was more. Reading a random sampling of reviews online just highlighted the unevenness, though, because so many people seemed to be reading entirely different books.<br /><br />The first thread, the metafictional, humorous side of the novel, predictably worked least well for me, though it worked better than any of the other books of that type that I have read. All of the characters know they are in a fairytale, and they either accede to the needs of the tale or try to shape it to their own ends depending on their personalities. There is also a sprinkling of anachronisms, which I read as another metafictional device, but may just be a leftover from Beagle's original vision of the story, which was set in modern times. What made this thread work better for me than those books who rely solely on the metafictional device is that Beagle used those moments when the characters broke the fourth wall to feed into his thematic concerns, something I will get to in a bit.<br /><br />The second thread, the straight-forward fairy tale, is exquisitely, heartbreakingly beautiful. Had Beagle written just this story I probably would have out-and-out loved it more, though it likely would not have lingered in my consciousness as long as I suspect this reading will. It has all sorts of fairytale tropes: the quest, the unlikely band of fellows, the evil crone and the evil king, the curse, a tragic romance. . . there's even a talking cat. This section is about finding one's true nature; it is also very much about love, and the way it makes heroes of anyone it touches. It also features the loveliest passages, like this one:<br /><br />\\"Under the moon, the road that ran from the edge of her forest gleamed like water, but when she stepped out onto it, away from the trees, she felt how hard it was, and how long. She almost turned back then; but instead she took a deep breath of the woods air that still drifted to her, and held it in her mouth like a flower, as long as she could.\\"<br /><br />The third thread, the allegory, is why this book has so much weight, the reason so many people can read totally different books in it and love them all. There are actually two related allegories here: one, running through the first half of the book, is about perception, and the way we see only what we expect to see; the other, coming to the fore in the second half of the book, is about the unicorn as a sort of Platonic Form of beauty. The presence of these allegories makes the book fail in a lot of ways as a straight fantasy novel -- as some reviewers have noticed, there are no people in the world but those absolutely necessary to the story/message, and the world-building is nothing like internally consistent. But ultimately the allegory is the reason The Last Unicorn is deservedly a classic, in any genre.fourth wall to feed into his thematic concerns, something I will get to in a bit.

0670022411|5.0|Book reviews are hard for me because unless the book was really bad, I have a hard time being objective and critical!  This book was one I simply could not put down until I was done.  When I finished it, I did not want it to end!!!  I wanted to follow the characters in more of their adventures.  The unlikely pairing of the two main characters made it all the more intriguing.      Believability of \\"creatures\\" other than humans living millenia next to one another adds to the amazing love story's seemingly impossible circumstances.  The delicious mix of vampire and witch lends a note of menace to what could have been a ho-hum relationship.      As you read of the witch, Dr. Diana Bishop's study of old grimoires, ancient alchemical manuscripts, and histories of witches, vampires, and daemons, then you add the vampire, Matthew Clairmont, noted geneticist, to the story and into her life, it begs one to wonder if these beings could interrelate, even fall in love regardless of the old prejudices within each of their realms.     I read this book on my Kindle and my forward-paging finger was worn out!!!  This was an addictive read for me!!  I can hardly wait until the next novel about Diana and Matthew (hopefully there will be a \\"next novel\\")!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|If you are looking for a mild cartoon movie, this is not the one. But if you are looking for a animated movie with strong character development and an engrossing story, this is strongly recommended. Without spoiling the story, it involves Batman and ancillary characters from the past and present. The plot development is good and the voice acting, excellent. There is probably more action than in the comic book arc to keep it an action offering.<br />It is also not an origin story like many other DCU animated offerings. So a minor primer on Batman and the supporting characters of Gotham would help viewers. This is also not for the squeamish as it pushes the boundary of what is acceptable for violence in an animated film with popular superhero characters.<br />All that said and done, fantastic animated movie.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Some argue that this cd doesn't have the \\"live\\" instrument feel and is \\"empty\\" - but I like the electronic sound he gave this cd.  Track 4 is especially good!  I give it 5 stars for it's creativity and new feel.  What would music of today be like without Yanni?  Have always loved his music and glad to hear he's back.  I think the album cover could have been a bit more inventive, but it's just a cover, right?
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I appreciate documentaries like these, where big companies don't want the truth to be known so it takes some special investigative reporting and a movie to at least make a snapshot of the information accessible. There are some critical tidbits of knowledge here. What moves me the most are the legal ramifications that ignorance has caused our society to witness JUST IN THE LAST DECADE, particularly the story behind Kevin's law (namely the law indicating that powers are given to USDA to shut down a food business that is not following regulations, but the law never passed), and the shocking transition of soybeans to the total ownership by Monsanto via \\"intellectual property\\" Microsoft-style (93% of all American soybeans as of March 2010 are patented). This stuff is downright scary, and people NEED TO KNOW. If it wasn't happening so fast I'd suggest that they learn it \\"one of these days\\", but so much of this happened just in the 1990s and 2000s, you need to know this NOW. RIGHT NOW, TODAY, NOT TOMORROW.
0061777250|2.0|You can in fact judge a book by it's cover.  The cover of \\"Consciousness Beyond Life\\" by Pim Van Lommel can be accurately prejudged by some small white text on the back edge of the spine that reads \\"Religion/Science\\".  This is a book that exists between the two- Too scientific to be dismissed outright as religion, yet too religious to be taken seriously as science.  Spoiler alert though- It is also inspired by politics (TL;DR, skip to the 2nd to last paragraph).    At about 400 pages plus appendices, the work is exceptionally comprehensive in the same way as a coffee table book.  It has a little of everything but not too much of anything.  This is at times a benefit and at others a fatal flaw.  We get to see the realm of the NDE as a forest and we get good glimpses at many of the trees, but a comprehensive scientific study of the forest would pierce down to the level of sap and chlorophyl.  In Consciousness Beyond Life we never see the EEG graphs or relevant MRIs, and though we almost always read the anecdotal accounts of the NDEer, we are left to accept or deny these accounts without explanation or professional psychiatric or scientific review.  For this reason and others, the book is at best an introduction to the NDE and no more.  It proves nothing, only hypothesizes.  It claims a few white crows, but offers the least possible analysis or evidence of them.    After a brief introductory chapter establishing a few of the fields of NDE research to be covered, the book proper begins in a curious place:  The impact of an NDE on the life of who experienced it.  The account given is conspicuous among others for its focus on the presumed disbelief of listeners, on the taboo of the subject.  At first I read this as an early attempt to assert a victim status, but giving the book the benefit of the doubt I threw away this unqualified presumption in favor of whatever the book had to offer and only considered it again once at the end of the book, which I'll explain when we get there.    The next few chapters summarize research on the NDE so far.  The major studies and scientists are covered and a Bosch painting is thrown in for good measure.  As this is a critique I won't hesitate to say that no illustration in this book is the least bit relevant.  There are pictures of brains and paintings of occult theory but not one of them adds to the text in any way.  They're there for amusement.  Anyhow the summary given is reasonable if incomplete, and try as I did to find a bias the section is quite legitimately impartial and representative of the NDE world thus far, with a special emphasis on the psychological effects on patients.  Good stuff and a great introduction to the field for a newcomer.      There's also a good chapter on NDE's throughout history, though when speaking of myth and afterlife rumors the author does tend to assume many elements were inspired by NDEs rather than other religious elements such as lies, financial gain, wish fulfillment and telephone-game style scriptural progression.      In chapter six we arrive at the summary of previous hard NDE research.  Being a broad stroke, the book doesn't go into the details of most cases, instead favoring a quantity of sources to synthesize a very general theory.  The subsection titled \\"Theories about the cause and content of an NDE\\" is only a page long.  Following that too-brief opening, carbon dioxide, ketamine, endorphins and more all get their 15 sentences of fame but considering this is the core of scientific research on the subject and in the minds of many readers, the sum total of the cause, this section is severely lacking when it comes to serious contemplation.  Of the brief and purely superficial accounts of each proven and researched cause, about half the writing under each heading is devoted to petty jabs and assertions of improbability toward the cause.  No rebuttals, no proofs offered, and many statements like \\"because naturally occurring ketaminelike substances have never been found in the brain this potential explanation must be abandoned\\" (pg 117) cut off what could have been a more fair summary of theories currently embraced by just about the entire neurological science community as the cause of NDEs.  About ten of the major theories are stated and quickly dismissed, electrical, chemical, psychological and so on.      I want to highlight the bit about deceit:      The notion that NDEs are lies is mentioned.  Here is how Van Lommel dismisses it: \\"A personal meeting will quickly dispel such suspicions, not just because of what they say about the experience, but above all because of the obvious emotions and the struggle to find the right words when they share their experience\\" (Pg.129-130.      To say I find that dismissal inadequate in a science book is a massive understatement.  It's about as convincing as proving creationism by claiming it's in the bible, and I consider this to be the book's lowest moment.  No case studies cited, no percentages mentioned, not one shred of science.  Merely, and I paraphrase, \\"I believe their anecdotes because they sounded convincing.\\"  Because 99% of this book is comprised of anecdotal evidence, this deficiency renders the book 99% useless conjecture.      In science, you back up your claims.  But this book is \\"Religion/Science\\".    Chapter seven covers the famous Lancet Study and the other \\"big three\\" of our time.  The only thing of note I found here (beyond the noteworthy study of course) was Van Lommels unique conclusion from the 4 studies that the experiences must have been recorded in the brain during their down time.  I have not seen this even suggested in all I've read of the other studies.  He does not supply a sufficient scientific proof that this must be so.  The other negative reviews here on Amazon are quite accurate in their criticism and little or no counter-arguments can be surmised from the material in the book, especially considering the vague and general assertions to come regarding quantum physics and other conclusions made by Van Lommel with only the most feeble, at times purely semantic connections.    So let's get to that section of the book.  After a brief interlude explaining the basics of brain activity (including Van Lommel's analysis of how reliable our current understanding is), we arrive at Chapter Eleven: Quantum Physics and Consciousness.  Acting on the idea that we don't understand many elements of the brain which Van Lommel surely knows have been explained to the satisfaction of, I think, every neurologist but him (Correction, he isn't even a neurologist), he goes into a \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" level analysis of atomic and quantum science which ignores the vast multitude of the subject that doesn't support his case and indulges in a detailed explanation of the few contradictory elements on the outskirts of quantum mechanics that sound on the surface like they support him.  Notions like \\"If subatomic particles can exist in two places at once, perhaps the mind can too.\\"  I found this section vulgar in concept and beneath the volume's aspirations.    From there it gets worse.  Chapters 12 and 13 reject materialism entirely in favor of Yogi philosophy, unsubstantiated (he had the whole book to substantiate this and never approached it scientifically) nonlocal consciousness and other purely religious concepts without any attempt to theorize on the scientific principals behind theories conjured seemingly more out of poetry than process.  All the usual occult shibboleths appear, mind over matter, reality as a construct of the ego, etc.  He didn't build up to it, he didn't cite enough to dig into it outright.  His sources for the chapter have been disproved on Mythbusters (Like the guy who yelled at plants and claimed they must be psychic, here presented in the context of his white blood cell remote control experiment which I've never read of being replicated by others).  He pays lip service to numerous ideas and semi-religious theories without ever successfully asserting their relevance, let alone proving it.      He mentions William James's white crow early in the book and clearly thinks he's caught it.  But he has in fact only heard a rumor of a rumor of a guy whose wife's brother saw a white bird that happened to make a sound which, though he'd never heard a crow, thought it sounded like a crow.  A weak section.  Did the girl who got a heart transplant really inherit the memories of its owner?  Don't expect to find out in the half page devoted to the critically relevant and fantastic topic (299-300).  If that one was a white crow, he let it fly away.    Then out of nowhere comes the chapter, \\"Endless Consciousness\\".  An unmerited and furthermore irrelevant heap of unsubstantiated conjecture and fancy in which we go from \\"Maybe there's something we don't understand\\" to \\"There must be an immortal soul\\".  The specifics of this chapter are unworthy of mention, suffice to say the book has at this point completely left the realm of science and better resembles Agrippa or Mathers.  Unrelated- Why do people who believe in tripe like \\"Souls\\" think they can't die?  They might outlive human bodies, but why does that suggest they can't die a death of finer matter?      Wish fulfillment, that's why.    So we near the end and as promised, we find out why the book was written.  Why it opened with a woman who was afraid of being disbelieved.  What Van Lommel has in his agenda and why it's so important for this Cardiologist to believe in unproven implications of the NDE:    The final chapter, epilogue and appendix are all concerned with the state of Organ Donation in the Netherlands.  Aha!  What does an NDE, what does an immortal soul in the flesh, what does all this we've read imply about the act of begging children for their parts then taking them when the subject is merely \\"Brain Dead\\".  Not dead at all according to Van Lommel.  What we just read was not, in fact, a scientific study of the NDE butan extensive polemic against Organ Donation practices.  Politics!  Bloody politics.    The bibliography is extensive and very well compiled, and a must have for anyone concerned with the subject.

Imagine my disappointment, when I get the new book, look at the new character class I most interested in, and find that I needed to correct nearly a half page with errata from their website., plus other bits and pieces of stray corrections i have to apply.  This after 3 rounds of play testing with each character class.    From now on I will preorder nothing from this company, anything I buy from them sits on the shelves for two years, before I even debate myself if I want it or not.
1551110989|5.0|Re-reading Jane Austen is one of the most rewarding things in life. I thought I knew Mansfield Park, having read it years ago. But the novel surprised and enthralled me all over again.<br /><br />In Mansfield Park, first published in 1814, everyone pretty much gets what he or she deserves. And there's something tremendously satisfying about that.<br /><br />The timid heroine, Fanny Price, is brought to Mansfield Park at age ten to relieve her struggling parents of a mouth to feed. She's destined to be the invisible, insignificant, useful, poor relation living by charity in the grand household of her uncle Sir Thomas Bertram, his wife and their two sons and two daughters.<br /><br />As the lowest and least among them, Fanny becomes a keen observer of human nature. And while her own feelings are constantly getting trampled upon or ignored, she develops tremendous compassion for everyone, even those who despise her.<br /><br />All the wrong people fall in love with each other, and Fanny is no exception. Mansfield Park is a feast of love tangles, power struggles and shocking behavior over money and position.<br /><br />I won't say anything about the plot, except that it's complex and utterly engrossing - or the characters, except that they're a wonderful mix of witty, worldly, naïve, infuriating, endearing and absurd.<br /><br />The introduction (best read last) more than fulfilled my desire for scholarly insights. Among other things, June Sturrock draws a compelling parallel between Sir Thomas's domestic tyranny and his slave plantation, uncovers depths of character in Fanny beneath her quiet exterior - and cleverly analyzes the curious prose style of the novel's ending.<br /><br />Whether you're reading this novel for the first time or replacing a tattered old copy, I'd definitely recommend the Broadview edition of Mansfield Park.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, probably better than the first one because now I have really gotten to know and like the characters. I like that the author has added her own \\"twist\\" on the paranormal in what causes Werewolves, normal misconceptions about them, and I really like the way that the wolves are somewhat disconnected mentally from their human selves- I think it creates a really interesting second side to the character.  I think the introduction of the character Cole was a really good idea as well.  I am very excited to read #3 in this trilogy.
1594202842|1.0|Real Chinese mothers are typically nurturing, loving and sacrificial, contrary to what Amy Chua portrays and claims, and she has no right to suggest that the typical Chinese mother is like her--she, herself, is like that, and her own mother may be like that, but not Chinese mothers in general.<br /><br />It is offensive, repugnant and irresponsible for her to present such an unfounded stereotype just to sensationalize and sell her book.  It is simply not true--it is only her own family dynamics--it is how she chose to raise her own children.<br /><br />Besides, she is really not a typical Chinese mom, but an aberration--she is a Filipino of Chinese ancestry, and hardly qualifies as a representation of Chinese motherhood.  My Chinese mother, my grandmothers, my relatives and most of the Chinese mothers I know and have heard of are not as Amy Chua portrays.  Besides, Amy Chua is not even married to a Chinese man or have a typical Chinese family.<br /><br />If one delves into Chinese history and the upheld examples of heroic Chinese mothers, you get a different picture--good mothers are loving, nurturing, sacrificial and wanting what is best and happiest for their children, not the monster portrayed by Amy Chua--Amy Chua is more like an example of an abusive mother, driven by blind ambition and cruelty, and quite sadistic.<br /><br />This is not parenting she portrays but child abuse disguised as mothering.  Tiger Mother my foot; more like eating your own cubs--even animals are more loving and nurturing towards their young.  What is portrayed is depraved mothering, if it can be considered mothering.<br /><br />By definition, mother and motherhood are associated with nurturing.  Why is Mother's Day such a big worldwide event--because we remember the love, caring, nurturing and sacrifices of our mothers, who picked us up when we were hurt, encouraged us, were so understanding and forgiving and accepted us for all our faults and weaknesses and gave us unconditional love.
B000VSBX34|5.0|The movie HELP! (UK-1965) was created during a turning point in the careers of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. It was here they fully broke with that Fab Four image and with simpler tunes like \\"Thank You Girl,\\" \\"She Loves You\\" and  \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand,\\" to explore deeper subjects and write more complex music. Even tracks such as \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"Don't Bother Me\\" and the title piece of [[ASIN:B0000542D2 A HARD DAY'S NIGHT]] (UK-1964), their first collaboration with director Richard Lester, gave indication of where the Beatles were heading.<br /><br />Songs written for HELP! inaugurate the two most amazing years in this or any other band's history. Right through 1966, recordings of sheer brilliance didn't flow from Abbey Road studios, they gushed in a torrent, but as [[ASIN:B000002UAO RUBBER SOUL]] and [[ASIN:B000002UAR REVOLVER]] were post-HELP!, a mention is all they'll get here.<br /><br />George's \\"I Need You\\" is a lover's lament. Three of John's tracks describe a complete cycle. \\"You're Going to Lose That Girl\\" expresses a fearful premonition, \\"Ticket To Ride\\" has his relationship actually ending and \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" is the result: a heartbroken man who's looking to withdraw.<br /><br />On a personal note, HELP! is my favorite rock-related movie. It also contains my single favorite Beatles song, performed on a boulder-lined Bahamas beach. The lyrics of Paul's \\"Another Girl\\" curiously begin mid-sentence. It's a superior tune on a serious subject (I'm leaving you for someone else), features an interesting key shift in the middle-eight and a great hook: Ringo's double-clutch foot pedal after lyric lines (\\"I don't wanna say that I've been... unhappy with you\\" boomboom!).<br /><br />Although Ringo doesn't have a vocal, he is central to the story. A ring firmly stuck on his right hand means that an Eastern cult will try to paint Ringo bright red and then sacrifice him on an ornate altar to a multi-armed god figure, that is if a scientist and his inept &aacute;ssistant don't amputate our hero's finger first. The zany pursuit is non-stop, the \\"gear\\" dialogue a delight.<br /><br />Granted the film's plot is silly, yet seeing the boys in color and in their absolute prime is still awesome all these years later. Knowing what came next musically is a bit of consolation to our 21st Century Beatles-less reality.. HELP! is a glimpse into the rarest time in rock history, when four working class Brits from a town on the Mersey estuary ruled the pop music universe. We'll never again know the likes of this classic movie or the brilliant lads who starred in it, but thank heavens it all happened!<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation.is inept ássistant don't amputate our hero's finger first.

HELP! is a glimpse into the rarest time in rock history, when four working class Brits from a town on the Mersey estuary ruled the pop music universe.

B002JCSWVG|5.0|Truly enjoyable, feel-good movie. Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman are both excellent in the aftermath of apartheid's collapse in South Africa. Notable are the sports scenes. Rugby isn't well known in the US but it is growing. The 2011 World Cup will take place in New Zealand.....NZ, Aus, SA, France amongst the strongest teams.
B004J713JW|5.0|After watching the\\" Last play at Shea\\" documentary dvd tonight and being at that awesome show myself  I'll be definitely getting this on bluray the second it comes out. What a thrill it was to see Roger Daultrey, Steven Tyler, Tony Bennett and Garth  Brooks perform that night- and what can I say about my main man Billy himself?- in a word-GREAT!, and when Sir Paul came out at the end to sing \\"Let it be\\"- it was the perfect ending to a night that I'll never forget. You'd be an absolute fool not to buy this!.

555532958X|5.0|The videotape pictured here was issued in 1987 as part of a now-rare Beatles box set, along with [[ASIN:B00000F3YL A HARD DAY'S NIGHT]] (UK-1964) and [[ASIN:6301095294 MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR]] (TV-UK-1967). It's a full screen dub with clean HiFi mono audio that switches to stereo for songs.<br /><br />The movie HELP! (UK-1965) was created during a turning point in the careers of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. It was here they fully broke with that Fab Four image and with simpler tunes like \\"Thank You Girl,\\" \\"She Loves You\\" and  \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand,\\" to explore deeper subjects and write more complex music. Even tracks such as \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"Don't Bother Me\\" and the title piece of [[ASIN:B0000542D2 A HARD DAY'S NIGHT]] (UK-1964), their first collaboration with director Richard Lester, gave indication of where the Beatles were heading.<br /><br />Songs written for HELP! inaugurate the two most amazing years in this or any other band's history. Right through 1966, recordings of sheer brilliance didn't flow from Abbey Road studios, they gushed in a torrent, but as [[ASIN:B000002UAO RUBBER SOUL]] and [[ASIN:B000002UAR REVOLVER]] were post-HELP!, a mention is all they'll get here.<br /><br />George's \\"I Need You\\" is a lover's lament. Three of John's tracks describe a complete cycle. \\"You're Going to Lose That Girl\\" expresses a fearful premonition, \\"Ticket To Ride\\" has his relationship actually ending and \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" is the result: a heartbroken man who's looking to withdraw.<br /><br />On a personal note, HELP! is my favorite rock-related movie. It also contains my single favorite Beatles song, performed on a boulder-lined Bahamas beach. The lyrics of Paul's \\"Another Girl\\" curiously begin mid-sentence. It's a superior tune on a serious subject (I'm leaving you for someone else), features an interesting key shift in the middle-eight and a great hook: Ringo's double-clutch foot pedal after lyric lines (\\"I don't wanna say that I've been... unhappy with you\\" boomboom!).<br /><br />Although Ringo doesn't have a vocal, he is central to the story. A ring firmly stuck on his right hand means that an Eastern cult will try to paint Ringo bright red and then sacrifice him on an ornate altar to a multi-armed god figure, that is if a scientist and his inept &aacute;ssistant don't amputate our hero's finger first. The zany pursuit is non-stop, the \\"gear\\" dialogue a delight.<br /><br />Granted the film's plot is silly, yet seeing the boys in color and in their absolute prime is still awesome all these years later.

B002ZG997C|3.0|This is sort of a \\"Road Warrior\\" meets \\"Left Behind,\\" with some \\"Cyborg\\" thrown in.  Mr. Washington is framed perfectly by the self-conscious cinematography and directing.  Some would go so far as to call them clich&eacute;d but I would call them iconic.  The writing is sloppy in parts* but the theme of duty, devotion and love of God powers through the rough patches.  Recommended.<br /><br />* E.g., SPOILER ALERT how does Mr. Washington escape from his jail cell or Solara escape from the cave or survive the crash of the Road Warrior vehicle when everyone else dies; how is it that Mr. Washington has been traveling west for 30 years but never made it to San Francisco?
B003UYV08E|4.0|A director who always stars in his own movies?  The last time we had this successful combo was Alfred Hitchcock.  Lately, we have Jon Favreau and his Iron Man movies.  Based on the Marvel Comics and starring his friend Robert Downey Junior, Iron Man 1 and 2 were box office successes and rated well with critics.  This 2nd installation takes of where the first one ended, and employs the same comedy, sarcasm, action style, and main characters as the first one, though with different villians of course.  And in this movie, the romance between Iron Man and his secretary / assistant leads to their first kiss.  As usual, the special effects are great, the story is original, the plot keeps the audience on their toes, and we have the SHIELD organization lurking in the background.  All told, a great movie.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|If you scroll, on down the Amazon Products, or do a search for the deluxe edition, for this Jeff Beck CD, you'll find, a special, deluxe, limited edition 2 CD set, which includes 8 bonus songs from another, live performance, at the Grammy Hall of Fame. These are sold by Amazon, \\"3rd Party\\", sellers. Just thought that would be helpful. The Special Deluxe, Limited Edition, is only available for a limited time, and is destined to become a genuine \\"collector's item\\". Thanks!!!!    Also another option is: if you buy the Amazon 1 CD version, along with Amazon's \\"Jeff Beck's Live at The Grammy Museum\\" CD, you'll have the basically the exact same thing, that was the \\"Deluxe, limited, edition. Because the extra bonus CD, on the 2 CD Deluxe Edition, 8 performances live from the Grammy Hall of Fame, contains the exact same 8 live performances, on the \\"Jeff Beck Live From the Grammy Hall of Fame CD\\". However, it will not be a genuine \\"collector's item\\", like the 2CD Deluxe Limited Edition, version. I hope this has been helpful. Thanks!!!
0711225176|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my artist wife after visiting the Mucha museum in Prague. The book was a good value from Amazon, and contains a fairly comprehensive collection of his work as well as family background and photos.  The hardcover book is nicely bound and seems decent quality construction. The large quantity and size of color plates are a pleasant surprise and a joy to look at. I like the book, and oh yes, my wife likes it too.

I agree with the people who said he's not saying anything new. I also agree with the people who didn't like the tone of the book. Even if this person DID have something valuable to say (i don't think so) it's not going to come across unless you deliver the message in the right package.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|If you like the Eagles, this is a rare look backward in time (1994) guaranteed to entertain.  The recording (sound quality) is superb; the photography is superb; and the selection of songs is \\"Eagles at their best.\\"  The appearance of Don Felder with the group is an added treat.  The \\"acoustic\\" treatment of the songs, particularly near the beginning of the set, is a very welcome change from the norm.  If you like the song, \\"Hotel California\\" and have a premium sound system, crank it up and enjoy the magic.<br /><br />I read some of the less positive reviews of this DVD and wonder where these critics are coming from.  The Eagles are the Eagles...and this is an excellent representation of their talent.  There is nothing (that I know of) that compares to the Eagles' five-point-harmony.  After being separated for 14 years, to come back on stage and perform like they did is truly a miracle, only possible from some of the finest musicians in this country.  Buy this and enjoy!
B0041KKYDI|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I wanted to see '127 Hours' because I kept wondering how anyone can make a film about a guy who gets his arm stuck under a boulder while hiking in the desert and then has to cut it off. Not only was I aware of the whole concept of the film and the ending but I also was wondering how do you make an interesting film about someone who is stuck in one small place for such a long period of time.<br /><br />To my great surprise, '127 Hours' is a riveting tale of one man's survival in the face of certain death. How does director Danny Boyle pull it off? For starters, James Franco is a brilliant casting choice to play Aron Ralston, the daredevil hiker who ends up between a 'rock and a hard place'. Franco is an immensely likable fellow who conveys Ralston's reckless and devil may care attitude that leads him to his date with destiny. When Ralston meets the two female hikers and escorts them to an underground grotto where they go swimming, Boyle uses that scene to reinforce our perception of Ralston as a daredevil, who risks his own life (as well as the lives of two strangers) as he seeks one more thrill, sliding between a crevice, and diving into the grotto, from a distance that an ordinary person would consider to be unsafe.<br /><br />The incredible thing about '127 Hours' (and I found this out after I watched the film) is that almost everything that we see actually happened. Ralston did have a video camera and filmed himself while his arm was stuck under the rock. And the video camera that was used in the film, was also the actual camera Ralston used when he was trapped! Boyle builds the tension simply by documenting everything that happened. At first Ralston believes he can move the rock through sheer strength. When that fails, he tries to be more calculating by using a pocket knife to chip away at the rock but soon discovers that plan is completely ineffectual (adding to the tension is the scene where Ralston drops the knife and must retrieve it by attaching a bent wire and guiding it down to where the knife has fallen, by placing the wire between his toes).<br /><br />Calling upon his survival skills, Ralston then designs an elaborate pulley system, hoping he'll be able to lift the rock, by using the weight of his body to move it. Finally, when that fails, he must concentrate on conserving the little water he has left, and figure out some other plan to extricate himself from his dire predicament. Boyle switches things up by introducing scenes in which Ralston begins hallucinating. In one such harrowing scene, after a cloud burst above in the desert, water cascades down into the crevice where Ralston is trapped, and he sees himself drowning. In another hallucinatory scene, Boyle introduces some comic relief by having Ralston imagine himself as a game show contestant, mocked by canned laughter due to his short-sightedness in failing to tell anyone where he was going.<br /><br />As to the amputation itself, I was relieved it wasn't as gruesome as I had anticipated. Actually, it was more fascinating than terrifying. In an earlier scene, Ralston discovers that he is unable to sever his arm using his small dull knife. Later, however, he figures out that he must break his arm in two places and then use the plier part of his knife kit to literally grind and twist until he cuts off his arm.<br /><br />As a result of this life changing event, Ralston has the epiphany that he had taken his family and friends for granted. Visions of the family and friends appear during the denouement and at the very end, Ralston himself, swimming in a pool, without his prosthesis, This of course suggests that the amputation has not squelched Ralston's love of the outdoors and taste for adventure. But one thing is for sure: when he takes a trip, he'll never again fail to tell those he is close to, where he is going.<br /><br />The cinematography and the editing is superb here in both the expansive exterior shots and in the claustrophobic area where Franco maneuvers. True, '127 Hours' is basically a carbon copy of a true event, but Director Danny Boyle manages to take a story where we already know the ending and still made it gripping and compelling. That, of course, is no easy feat!rs.

B000002J1S|5.0|This magical musical story & collection of 23 extraordinary songs is unmatched in Rock music history. No other Rock Opera meets the quality and complexity of lyrics and instrumental compositions that these now famous and legendary musicians fortunately created for all of us to enjoy back in the 70's. If BROADWAY had the vision or Genesis members had enough motivation &/or ambition to find a way to create an updated version of this Masterpiece for a Broadway musical then we'd all be priviledged enough to witness a Musical that reaches new heights in creativity,  excitment, wonder, & true lyrical & instrumental expertise never seen on broadway before. The difficulty and challenge would be the vocal & instrumental talent required to match the extraordinary talents on GABRIEL, BANKS, HACKETT, RUTHERFORD, & COLLINS (Yes, in that order.). Hopefully one day this Musical will become a reality. Until then I'll just hope & dream of what could be.
0765348276|4.0|I was skeptical of John Scalzi comparisons to Robert Heinlein, but after reading Scalzi's debut novel, OLD MAN'S WAR, I can attest to the similarities. Both employ a very dry narrative voice and no trace amount of situational irony.<br /><br />I finished OLD MAN'S WAR in less than a week and thoroughly enjoyed myself, but when I reached the end, I wished there was more. What I read could have easily been the introductory 300 pages to an epic 800-page space opera, but that would necessitate a plot. The many and varied alien species we encounter are fun, but none are engaged more than twice. The groundwork is laid for an amazing story that never materializes.<br /><br />The science is trite and only one philosophical proposition--retaining humanity in an inhuman life form--is fleshed out in any detail. Ultimately, there's nothing memorable about OLD MAN'S WAR, just that you had a good time and a few hearty chuckles. The heir to Heinlein has some work to do...
0061992860|4.0|I bought this book on a lark a few weeks back, and it's great. However when I unboxed the shipment I was rather taken aback by the book's dimensions! It is 4.7\\" x 3.3\\" x 1\\", which is about 75% of the size of the typical trade paperback. To be clear, I was not misled, only lazy because I never bothered to look at the book's dimensions which are clearly published on the Amazon product page. However because this is such an easy thing to overlook I wanted to mention it in the review.<br /><br />For its size, this book definitely packs an enormous amount of information, covering everything from camp setup to medical treatments. Of course, the advantage of such small dimensions is the ability to carry it along in your backpack!<br /><br />In summary, it's a great reference book, and well worth the purchase.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Having seen this show several times both in London and on tour in the US, it was a huge treat to be able to experience this 25th Anniversary Performance from the O2 Arena. I was fortunate enough to see it in  a US theatre the one night it played a few weeks after this was recorded. This show sold out the gigantic O2 so quickly they added a second show, which also sold out. It  was beamed live to theatres around the UK. And it just won \\"Theatre Event of the Year\\" in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers Choice Awards. I am delighted that they decided to make it available for Region 1. As wonderful as the 10th Anniversary show was, this is better in some ways. The lighting, the sets and projections, the lush orchestrations and the vast audience that just electrified the air add to the whole experience.   This was an incredible group of performers that still gives me chills when I recall it. Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, is trained as as operatic tenor. He was spectacular in every way. He shows a very supple vocal range. He can hit & hold the high soft notes & belt out the big showstoppers with equal dexterity. I really do like Lea Solonga but felt she was just a little weak as Fantine. (She was killer as Eponine on the 10th.) Norm Lewis was a wonderfully wicked yet human Javert. His baritone strong & menacing & yet soft & soulful as he wrestles his conscience and loses. Katie Hall was a convincing as Cosette. Nick Jonas, in a bit of \\"stunt casting\\" that went badly awry, was Marius. It was glaringly apparent when matched with multi-award winning West End & Broadway veterans. Though he did get better. (This actually played two nights in the UK October 2-3. This is a compilation.) Canadian, Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras, the student leader, was impeccable. He has previously played this role & that of Marius. He's starred as the Phantom in London & is now playing the role in the sequel, Love Never Dies. (He has already twice been voted \\"Best Actor in a Musical\\"  & is nominated for an Olivier this year for the same role.) Matt Lucas and Jenny Galloway obviously enjoyed their time as the Thernadiers, which made them great fun to watch. The encores must be mentioned again. They were incomparable to anything I've every seen.  If you love Les Mis, you will love this show. Don't try to compare it with the 10th. With its rich new orchestrations, new sets, some changes in the lyrics and slight yet clarifying changes in the show, it stands alone.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|An Education presents an interesting examination of greed, taboos, choices and consequences.<br /><br />Jenny (Carey Mulligan) appears to be at the top of her class. She relishes the good grades that she inevitably receives.  She is almost smug in her willingness to answer questions.  She is the consummate teacher's pet.  Jenny's father Jack (Alfred Molina) has been grooming the young lady for an Oxford education.  Every detail down to her hobbies has been carefully planned out for her.<br /><br />When Jenny has a chance encounter with an older man, David (Peter Saarsgard), her plans get derailed.  David exudes opulence.  His cunning leads you to believe that something is just not right.  He even convinces Jenny's father into allowing her to go away on a weekend trip to Oxford.  Jenny sacrifices her studies for an engagement to a man who is not exactly who he pretends to be.  The problem for Jenny lies in the fact that she has already seen through the facade and chosen to ignore the warning signs.  It becomes an education that will exceed anything that Oxford can teach her.<br /><br />Nick Hornby adapted An Education from a memoir written by Lynn Barber.  It intrigues me that this film is based on actual events, although I have not read the original material.  Having said that, I would not consider myself stunned by the point that this film is based on actual events.  This story takes place near London in the 1960s, in a neighborhood where the illusion of the white picket fence still permeates sensibilities.  The characters are well drawn and the scenarios carefully played out to make events feel credible.  It would seem impossible that a man could convince a young girl's father to allow her a weekend romp with the man, especially in a day and age when decorum was so heavily emphasized.  Yet we all know someone like Jack.  They have a conniving way of making things seem like your idea.  The manner in which those concepts were conveyed lent believability to the story.<br /><br />Mulligan and Molina made this story for me.  Their characters both have an undercurrent of suspicion, yet both seem to put on blinders to reality.  Their performances helped seal the deal.  Saarsgard was good as a con artist, and didn't seem to overplay his hand.  Rather than coming across as a greasy used car salesman, Saarsgard creates a more cultured conman that lends further dimension to the role.  That also goes back to the writing.  An Education was well cast.<br /><br />I enjoyed An Education slightly more than I thought I would.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but figured I would watch the film since it was an Oscar nominee.  It wasn't exceptional enough to win an Oscar, and it didn't.  Even though this film was based on a true story, I wouldn't consider it particularly unique.  The ending was okay but not fantastic.  I might have considered Mulligan for the Best Actress nomination (but not given it to her) but am surprised that the film itself was nominated for Best Picture.  It just wasn't that good.

B004A8ZX28|3.0|A man visiting Berlin for a conference is in an auto accident, and suddenly his wife doesn't know him, and another man has stolen his identity. The film has quite a bit of excitement in it, but a significant plot hole. The story line is a bit ludicrous, but the presence of Liam Neeson elevates the film. His depth as an actor brings nuance to a role that could have been an outrageous action hero. The story takes an interesting turn toward the end that explains the confusion of the protagonist. A modest recommendation for a movie that provides a little harmless popcorn fun.
B003P2VBIK|4.0|Rather you were a fan of the TV series or not this is a strong Sci-Fi buy. It's different from the TV series, but in mostly positive ways. The writer has done his research and for any science buff you will find it a mostly rewarding read. He does make a few stretches regarding how future technologies may work that are a bit ridiculous, but not so much they ruin the story. If you were a fan of the show this book will allow you to close that chapter of your life by answering the questions the show left open.    Although some parts of the story can be a bit dull if you are expecting the action offered by the TV show they aren't too bad. One of my favorite aspects of the book is the opinions offered by the various character's on rather or not we live in a predetermined universe and how their view of the their future affects them.     I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys concepts involving time travel, quantum physics and fate.
B00406UK7S|4.0|This movie asks the question what happened to the ninth legion?  It's a matter debated by scholars which is ongoing and recent opinions of the legion's demise has resettled in Briton.  That said, this movie isn't big on historical treatise and instead focuses on beautiful landscapes (filmed in Scotland) and bloody, brutal battles.  The 9th gets mostly wiped out and then it's a mad escape for a few men from the vengeful pursuit of the Picts.  Fairly good use of a spear by the silent female tracker contrary to what people are saying on here and yes the women did fight with their men.  There are some logical issues in the tale but they aren't serious by the standards of most.  Very impressive that this entire film was made on only ten million dollars.  STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B minus; ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; MY GRADE: B minus to B (B to B plus if you enjoy the genre); WHEN WATCHED: 02/07/2011.
B003L1ZXM0|5.0|I'll be honest I started this book with the best intentions but did not think it would help.  I have to say it made me look at things at some-what of a different angle.

I know I did.  Thank you for reading.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This is one of the best documentaries I've ever watched.  Whether you like motorcycles, or just like a good a movie.  Getting to the point, if you're considering buying it, I definitely recommend On Any Sunday.  You won't be sorry.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|My favorite thing about this documentary besides the well presented arguments and explanations is how the interviewers refrain from stooping down Michael Moore's level of demonizing and asking loaded questions. In all cases, the questions seem reasonable if a little pessimistic about receiving a straight answer; an unflattering response and loss of temper is shown on only one occasion (and by then the guy clearly deserves it), the rest very clearly speaks for itself.  Even Matt Damon's calm and steady narration relies solely on the power of the presented arguments to make the case. A film that can evoke such powerful emotion without resorting to melodramatic footage of starving orphans is a rare and excellent thing.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I found \\"Ender's Game\\" to be a great read and a fantastic story, but I wish the author would provide more descriptive details. He does explain in the preface that this was his intention, allowing readers to experience the story using their own imagination. I can appreciate that, but there were some of the games in Battle School I had a hard time visualizing because the author gave very little details.    The second reason for my four star rating is that I personally did not feel the age of the children was realistic. Again, he touches on this in the preface, giving examples of children who have written to him stating how much they identified with Ender. My problem is that Ender is 6 years old, being groomed and trained to be a military commander. If he was 12-13 I could find it more plausible. That nagging feeling of it being unrealistic stuck with me throughout the book.    Besides these two points, Ender's Game is definitely a book worth reading.
1416594787|4.0|Books & movies are hard to review.  What is enjoyable & well-presented to one person may not be to another person.  In my review, I will try to paint a brief picture of what it's like to read this book and how it left me feeling at the end, all in the context of the titles.    The book provides a lot of scientific details.  In many cases, this is good as Prof. Dawkins needs those details to build up to a summary point about various topics.  The science he discusses is very good in helping the reader understand some of the enormous and complex biological world in which we live all within a relatively short text.    However, just be aware that the evidence he presents can be exceptionally detailed at times and, in my opinion, often unnecessary for the casual reader who doesn't want a lesson in, say, cell biology.  At some points during the reading, I felt as if I was in a college science class which I did not enjoy! :)    In other Dawkins books I have read, Prof. Dawkins often provides a stinging and powerful summary after leading up to his points.  Some of his attempts in this book to summarize big points or whole chapters are not as \\"solid\\" as he is known for in other of his writings.  Some are, but some aren't.  I suspect he wants his scientific presentations to stand on their own, and avoid some of the rhetoric which he has been involved with in other books.    As with most of Dawkins books that I have read, I find his writing style easy to follow and digest.  He generally explains his thought processes very well.    In closing, I would summarize by saying that the book provides very interesting information and strong evidence.  Sometimes it's a little too much \\"scientific\\" information for the \\"non-scientist\\" and sometimes the summaries or major points are not as powerful as one would hope.  But, overall it's a much better-than-average book on this subject, and worth reading.

B003XT60KO|5.0|Only a retard would give this book a bad review just because it doesn't address &#34;externalities&#34; or because the book doesn't speak in terms of &#34;aggregate demand&#34;. That's akin to complaining about the lack of Wookies in the latest Star Trek movie. Furthermore, this is not a &#34;conservative&#34; book. I used to be a conservative, and I remember being quite uneasy about a handful of these chapters, the first time I read this book. Over the years, I've changed my views, and I now believe Hazlitt is correct.

However, this seems to be a combination of the microphone's inherent characteristics and some sort of windows misfeature.  This is using Audacity under windows 7, but the same complaint is widespread on the net on other platforms.<br /><br />A high-order bit is that if you use the ASIO driver, then (somewhat nonintiutively) the level seems to be about 10 dB higher than using the builtin windows support, which is a significant difference.  It *will* work without ASIO (without installing any drivers at all), but the level will be lower.  And with ASIO there seems to be no record level adjustment at all.  The windows control has no effect, and the Audacity control is disabled.  You can of course change the level digitally, but this won't recover from clipping.<br /><br />As it says in the manual, this microphone is intended for vocal use at a fairly close distance (4-5 inches.)  If the level is maxed out, and I speak in a loud-normal voice at this distance, then the level is plausible (but nowhere near clipping.)  If I sing at this distance, then I can send it into clipping.  Since there is no level adjustment with ASIO, I have to back off to a foot or so.<br /><br />This is speculation, based on ignorance of the details of the USB microphone protocol, but it seems that in the absence of any way to set the analog gain before digitization, there is always going to be a design compromise of what level to use, and since a too-low level can be more-or-less recovered with digital gain, whereas clipping is just plain bad, Behringer chose a low analog gain level.<br /><br />I don't understand what the windows record level control does with a USB mic, whether it is actually sending something to the mic, or just postprocessing the signal somehow.  But the onset of clipping is different using ASIO or the windows driver, so something real is going on.  It seems that some other mics, like the CAD37  [[ASIN:B001AIQGUO CAD U37 USB Studio Condenser Recording Microphone]] mentioned as an \\"also bought\\" item have a much higher gain, which results in the opposite \\"I had to put it outside my door\\" problem for musical use.<br /><br />In summary, I'd say that for podcasting and spoken voice use, choose another microphone.  In general, it seems that the USB microphone concept still has problems with setting levels.at some other mics, like the CAD37  [[ASIN:B001AIQGUO CAD U37 USB Studio Condenser Recording Microphone]] mentioned as an \\"also bought\\" item have a much higher gain, which results in the opposite \\"I had to put it outside my door\\" problem for musical use.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I came across M&S while listening to some music on Pandora. At the time I was primarily a hard rock fan who had grown bored with the monotony of the genre.   When Pandora played Little Lion Man, I knew something was special with M&S. I procured a copy of Sigh No More within a few days and the rest is history.  There has been a 180 in how I listen and appreciate music. All other music seems so bland now. This album is musical perfection, period. Every song moves me in different ways.  The obsession with M&S paired with their only having one album has lead to my wife and I searching out other New Folk bands. We have since grown to love the songs by Tallest Man on Earth and the Avett Brothers.  Thanks M&S for everything.
159448385X|2.0|The author just took the worst of worsts of Afghanistan and stuffed it into two or three characters. This story is highly unlikely and of course its FAKE, its a fiction novel. I wouldnt invest my time in in this kind of fluff. We can only expand our minds by seeking truth and knowlege.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Again, I have enjoyed watching a Nicole Conn Lesbian film, Elene Undone.  Nicole and Marina have such raw talent and emotional insight that puts our lesbian lives and loves into perspective.  These two women are true inspirations and hope for our LGBT community.  The actresses Necar Zadegan and Traci Dinwiddie are excellent in the film and have great chemistry. I have watched Nicole's other films Cynara - Poetry in Motion and Claire of the Moon. These movies have quality, substance and excellent story lines.  I can't wait for the next one \\"A Perfect Ending\\".

B004GAY2GS|4.0|I'm delighted to finally have this; it's been a gap in my IA/JT collection. First of all, this is not remastered--at least it doesn't say so anywhere on the packaging. (I've come to learn that remastering can sometimes do more harm than good.) It's worth having for the title track alone--vocally, IA does something akin to a scat. I've never heard him use his voice instrumentally in this way without blowing into a flute or harp. Here and elsewhere, his vocals are more subdued relative to his JT work. In hindsight, this might have been the direction he should have taken, given his voice problems from about this time onward. It's a good disc. Comparing it to corresponding JT releases is apples to oranges, but I would certainly reach for this over \\"Broadsword,\\" and no less often than \\"Under Wraps.\\"
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a great musical movie with the perfect cast members. Christina Aguilera is a very good actrice/entertainer in this movie and Cher still has what it takes after all these years! I was extremely impressed with the superb costumes and excellent performance of each cast members. Burlesque is a fun, daring, and sexy treat from the beginning to the end. Loved it!
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Everyone who wants to see \\"Black Swan\\" asks recent viewers the same question: \\"Did you like it?\\" The answers are guarded, focusing on the film's quality acting and cinematography. But did I like it?<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Nina, a 28-year-old ballerina who is desperate to act in a new and controversial production of Swan Lake. Nina is a shy, mousy-voiced young woman who rarely goes out and who lives with her ex-ballerina mother in a New York apartment. Her mom seems strangely intent on keeping Nina secluded, setting up the movie to appear as a coming of age drama in which a talented young person needs to break away from home to become a star. But there's more than meets the eye - there's something off about the way Nina experiences the world. Meanwhile the ballet's imperious director is pushing her to \\"let go\\" of her inhibitions so she can better inhabit the role of the Black Swan, the demonic twin of the beautiful and delicate White Swan that Nina can play with her eyes closed. The tensions between Mom's protectiveness, her director's haranguing and Nina's own repressed desires perfectly propel the story.<br /><br />This ain't your ordinary ballet story. It richly deserves its \\"R\\" rating for scenes of sexuality and violence, so leave the pre-teens at home and think twice about bringing the high-schoolers. But it is a visually compelling film. The ballet scenes are gorgeously choreographed, with sound effects added (needlessly?) to enhance ballet's silent movements. Natalie Portman easily deserves an Oscar for her performance, even if the film might not. She is the desperately shy naïf, haunted by visions and fears. The rest of the cast was wonderful. As for the film itself, I am torn. The story was compelling, and far from formulaic. The scenes portraying Nina's inner life - especially her dreams - are rightly frightening, disturbing and confusing. The Jungian theme of wrestling with one's shadow -- one's denied and hated side -- prevails over everything. But \\"Black Swan\\" really only works on one level - maybe one and a half. It is often little more than a story of a woman trying to break out of her own shell, one that has both constricted and protected her. The easy message - that freedom is always and necessarily positive - is belied by the crisis that ends the film.<br /><br />\\"Black Swan\\" is interesting, intense, beautiful and disturbing. But as being neither an allegory nor a cautionary tale, it seems to have nothing to say beyond itself.ck Swan\\" really only works on one level - maybe one and a half.

B004ETVAH0|5.0|... The Roy Orbison \\"Black & White Night\\", Carl Perkins' \\"Rockabilly Session\\" and the Elvis \\"68 Comeback Special\\" as one of the coolest / rockin'est shows you'll ever see. Beck is in fine form, and the band (including guest spots from Brian Setzer and others) is really cracking. The setlist is a perfect blend of Les Paul / Mary Ford classics and early rockabilly gems.    Essential.
1586210661|5.0|I really liked this for a long road trip I went on. The stories are short, about 10 mins each, so you can listen to one really quick, listen to a few at a time, switch back and forth between stories and music/radio, etc. Sedaris is hilarious.
B00441GYZ6|4.0|When it comes to biopics, Milos Forman (Man On The Moon) is as good at it gets.  He does a great job getting the audience to not only sympathize with but look upon self-proclaimed smut peddler Larry Flynt as a good guy.  By far Woody Harrelson's best role.  One must assuem based on her real life trials and tribulations with stripping and drugs, Courtney Love didn't have to stretch too much for the role of Althea.  Overall, a great film and fun to watch---highly recommended.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This movie shows with concern and great photography what the fracking process of the gas extraction companies is doing all over north america.  To say that it is being done in secret is obvious because the mainstream media is owned by the same people and knowledge of what they are doing would make americans rather upset. Even the most die hard tea party supporters would complain if their water was flammable, and they are the ultimate in radical hypocrasy.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|All I want to say is I FINALLY got to watch this GREAT movie ( sort to speak).  I don't have a BAD word to say about MJ!!  But, I will say, I cried at the end...  I wanted it to go on and on!!!  It is a MUST see and BUY!!  I have cable so I got to see it, but we WILL buy it.  Sorry I don't have a LONG post review.
B000005Z0G|4.0|Tupac's second album picks up where the first one left off, and continues his commentary assault on corrupt politics and institutions in America. Although perhaps slightly less politically charged than his debut, thats only because he's added more elements here: hes now examining his own paranoia, fear, and uncertainty caused by the social injustices he sees around him, seen on Streetz R Death Row and the self-titled song.    This album, though not on the same level as his later work, is an improvement from 2Pacalypse Now. His voice and flow are much more pronounced, and the production is a tad better. Some of his best songs ever are featured here, including Holler If Ya Hear Me (one of the best openings to an album ever), Last Wordz (featuring Ice T and Cube), Keep Ya Head Up, Papaz Song, I Get Around, and the self titled song. Papaz Song is somewhat of an unsung gem in his catalog, which was kind of a analysis of the type of men that he alerted women to avoid in Keep Ya Head Up. This was really the first album where Pac's charisma began to show, and his songs began to talk to eachother.    Certainly this is a must have for any Pac fan. While not as good as the dark but also very profound and brilliantly written masterpiece \\"Me Against the World\\" or his anti-hero masterpieces \\"All Eyez on Me\\" and \\"7 Day Theory\\", it is worth the price of purchase. 4 stars.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|The writers and JJ Abrams take on the daunting task of rebooting the franchise, but in doing so, create a story devoid of any semblance of logic, rationale, or basic common sense.<br /><br />As I am sure the writers wanted the freedom to create new storylines without being impaired and respecting stories already told, they wrote a story rittled with a plethora of contrived plot points and deus ex machinas in order to get their end result.  Because of this fact, the story seems to be written from end to beginning rather than vice versa.<br /><br />So, how do they get to their desired end result?  Their way of thinking resembles a, \\"If this happens then this must happen.\\" form of logic.  When you see the movie, the story is technically plausible.  The problem is the choices made in the movie to reach the ending is so contrived based off of zero common sense, dumb luck and irrational thinking, the story is completely implausible.  Watching the first 10 minutes of the movie, you'll notice at least 10 contrived plot points.<br /><br />You would be better off watching the Original Series or Next Generation.  The characterazations are better and at least you can have some fun.  This movie was a lot of bark, but no bite.  It's a good blu-ray at the very least, hence the two stars.  It's the content that is poor.<br /><br />EDIT:10/01/12<br />Rating change.  What use is a good blu-ray, if the content is crap.  Might as well just have left it blank.<br /><br />Since the movie has been out for some time now and shown on cable, I can cite some specific examples:<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />\\"James Tiberius Kirk!\\" the boy proclaims.  This is the introduction of our main protagonist?  Seriously?  Seriously?  I have never met a person that introduced himself using his middle name in all of my jeezny.  That straight out reeks of pretentiousness.  And this is the person we are supposed to root for?  Of course this douche bag attitude flows in with the Kobayashi Maru exercise.  Aperfect setup to actually develop character and show Kirk's ability and prowess to command a ship and overcome a tough situation.  Instead, he sits there and does...nothing!<br /><br />Now, let's make him 1st Officer.  Why?  No reason other than the fact that it has to be done or else the story won't work.  He's shouldn't be aboard the Enterprise, thus not even a regular crew member, but Pike makes him acting 1st Officer, pretty much on a whim.  Had this not been done, Kirk would not have the chance to become acting Captain later in the movie.  I guess the writers felt that being illogical here they could be illogical later as well.<br /><br />\\"You expect me to talk?\\"<br />\\"No Mr. Bond.  I expect you to die!\\"<br /><br />Sorry.  Wrong movie.  It just seemed like Nero was a generic Bond villian.  Bond villians, as sadistic as they are, like to bump off 007 in some gruesome yet unique way.  Thus, some elaborate death.  It gets him out of the way for them to focus on their main goal of world domination or whatever.  In this case, Nero wants Spock (Nimoy) to suffer.  So what does he do after he captures him?  He let's him go!  Seriously?  Seriously?  No maiming.  No physical torture.  No psychological torture.  Yeah, he destroy's Vulcan, be could still do that with Spock aboard the ship to continue toying with him.  But the story is ridgid and told from backwards to beginning, so he has to be freed to allow the deus ex machina to happen.<br /><br />Deus Ex Machina...er, Trans-Warp Beaming!  Kirk needs to get back on the Enterprise, but how?  Hmm...Beaming!  But the Enterprise is at warp speed?  Beaming is faster!  But the coordinates are unknown?  Spock is smart.  He knows the formula!  Oh yeah!  That's brilliant!  Let's plug in the variables.  The rate is unknown, the time is unknown and the distance is unknown.  A forumla filled with variables can help them get to an unknown location moving at faster than the speed of light, at an unknown rate from an unknown startingpoint will get them there safe and sound?  Of course!  And it does!  What's the need for transport ship anymore when you can just hopscotch beam from solar system to solar system?
0307341550|3.0|The author did a good job of getting you into the feel of a small town, but the limp spine of the protagonist in the book started to become a real turn-off about halfway through ... especially when (SPOILER ALERTS) she jumped in bed with a teenager, and then allowed her mother to continue poisoning her. No, her character wasn't compelling at all. Sure, many great characters in books have flaws, but they're largely outnumbered by the interesting or decent qualities within them. This woman was so broken and twisted up as a human being that there wasn't much about her that drew me towards her as a character. For that reason, I have to notch this rating down a star from 4 to 3.
159562015X|5.0|This booked really hit the nail on the head as far as my strengths. I know there are those who rated this book low because it only gives you your top 5 themes. However, I think the top 5 themes are the ones we really need to concentrate on. If we spend too much time on the other themes, it really defeats the whole purpose of the book.
B0002CHIJW|5.0|Excellent. This is the version to have as recommended by dvdcompare.  Not all movies out there are sweetness and nice. Some movies are ugly and show up the darkside of the human character.  This is a horror movie not something produced for titillation but it is not a movie that should be banned.  Be warned it is exteme and hard to watch in places.
0439023521|4.0|The story is set sometime in the future in an imagined post-apocalyptic North America, which has become a series of unconnected districts governed by an elite and brutally suppressive central capitol located in the Rocky Mountain region. To flaunt its power over the districts, which once rebelled against the capitol, each year two children are chosen from each district to compete in the Hunger Games of the title, a cross between a survival contest and extended gladiatorial fight from which only one contestant will survive.<br /><br />Katnis, a young teenage girl, becomes a contestant for District 12 when she volunteers to take the place of her younger sister, who was chosen in the annual lottery. The intensity of the story increases and she and Peeta, the boy chosen from her district, travel to the capitol where they are groomed, trained, and otherwise prepared for the coming contest. Peeta's obvious desire to befriend and help Katnis only serves to confuse her, because she knows they both cannot survive the games, and conceivably could end up fighting each other.<br /><br />I confess I found the world Collins created to set her story in extremely implausible--something that usually is a deal killer for me when reading a novel. Also, the writing is geared for younger readers. Despite those two factors, though, I found the story compelling and hard to put down--a tremendous testament to Collins' storytelling skill.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|This is a pretty cool accessory - I use it on both my Joovy Kooper stroller and our Burley D'Lite trailer.    The metal bar in it that serves to stabilize the tray might get in the way when folding your stroller up, it depends on your model. I just usually work around this by unhooking one side of the tray before folding my stroller.    I wish the cup holders were a tad larger so I could put more than a water bottle in there. It seems like they're made for disposable water bottle sized items, but we never use those. Still, I can get drinks in and out suitably.    I love the tray portion in the middle. It's fantastic for throwing my keys and cell into.    Overall a good product, but not perfect.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Del Toro loves Lovecraft and it shows. The image of the Old Ones' tentacles coming down from the skies is terrific, as is the creature at the end. The movie has a sense of humor and doesn't take itself too seriously...I like that. I enjoyed it.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I have nothing but good to say here. For fans, this will tread ground you know well, but in a way that feels new and fresh. The interpersonal dynamic is wonderful here, maturing just as the actors have. The deeply felt and often painful moments are interspersed -- gently and with grace -- by beautiful, tender moments. Hermione and Harry dancing in the tent, at the bleakest of moments, is a wonder to see and is alone worth the price of admission.
B002RL7W9W|3.0|Boght this for my nephew for Christmas and was disappointed when it arrived because it is much smaller than depicted but nevertheless, he enjoyed putting it together.
0061726826|2.0|As usual, I really wanted to like this one. It was one of the original books on my wishlist. I'd like to say that it was the excitement that made me not like it as much, but I don't know. I just felt so underwhelmed by it. It just didn't grab me like I would have liked.<br /><br />Lena was a product of her environment. She believed mostly everything she'd heard about Love, that it was disease and it was the root of everything bad. Now, when you turn 18, they basically give you a lobotomy so you won't fall victim to the \\"disease\\". They refer to it as being cured. Sounds like it totally sucks, huh?<br /><br />Lena is OK as a protag. I don't know, I just didn't really connect with her. In the beginning, she is very dedicated to the cause. Of course, she believes that everything they are doing is for their own good. Honestly, she annoyed me (in the beginning!). But then, she freely admitted her faults and that she was scared. I grew to like her more though. I also felt she was a little too descriptive in her thoughts. It seems like everything she talked about had to have something likened to it. I searched, and the word like is used 732 times.<br /><br />Alex was OK as well. I still had a lot of questions about him and his life. He was a good guy. I can't think of anything else to say about him. Just an average nice guy. He never pushed Lena for more than a ton of kisses.<br /><br />The book is fairly clean, I say fairly because some of the violence is pretty bad compared to the lightness of the rest of the book. Not too much goes on until the end. You learn a lot about what life is like there. But there isn't a main evil top figure (like President Snow) that you can be mad at.<br /><br />Oh, and what was up with that ending?? Did not like! Did not like one bit! I kind of felt like a lot of things weren't answered, the ending was so abrupt. I guess I was looking for more triumph. Hmmm, maybe there will be a sequel? I want to know what happened with everyone.<br /><br />After all this, I do still recommend it. People who love a good love story will enjoy this one. I think a lot of readers will enjoy reading about Lena's emotions as she comes to terms with everything. Futuristic Portland is scary and even though you sometimes get the sense of freedom, there really isn't any. Yep, its scary. I also enjoyed the headings at the beginning of each chapter. Creepy stuff! It really pushes home just how much things have changed.who love a good love story will enjoy this one.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Very informative.
B003L20ICE|4.0|It seems to me that many of the reviewers who have posted here have zeroed in on the affair between Jules and Paul as the weak spot in this movie.  Maybe they think that since Jules and Nic are lesbians, neither could ever have a heterosexual relationship.  What if the couple were heterosexuals - would a same-sex dalliance be more believable?    Although the affair is somewhat predictable as a plot device, I did not have any problem believing that it could happen.  Jules is frightfully insecure, Paul is about as laid-back as it gets and he is paying her some positive attention.  Yes, he takes advantage of her vulnerability, he is flawed as are most of the other characters in some way.  He also provides both kids with some valuable companionship and guidance.  It is good for them both to have a father figure in their lives - the estrogen in that house can get pretty oppressive.    I think Jules's speech toward the end where she says they are a family like any other family, they mess up but they love each other and she is sorry and hopes they can forgive her, is crucial.  That's the point.  They are a family and they do love each other.  I think Paul would dearly love to be part of that family but he closed the door on that opportunity when he went to bed with Jules.  Then he's a jerk to Tanya.  So I feel sorry for him but I think he deserved what he got.    As for the ending, I bought it.  Not that they are going to put it behind them forever, but they acknowledge that they need and love each other, and at least in that moment they are committed to trying to make the relationship work.    As almost every reviewer has pointed out, the acting is uniformly superb.  This is not a big film but it is a very good one.
B001URY5IU|5.0|My 5 year old loves this!  The set takes very little time to assemble.  My son has now changed everything and added it to his other sets.  Still, very good set for the price.
B004DH8IK0|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this album. I have both of their previous albums and I love that Immersion seems to take the best qualities from both of those albums and combine them to make something of epic proportions. Stand out tracks to me are Watercolour, Crush, Immunize, The Island parts 1 & 2(the way they flow together makes this, in my opinion, THE most epic track of all time), The Vulture(so reminiscent of Dance Dance Revolution. It needs to be featured on the next release) and Witchcraft. Of course all of the tracks are great but these are the tracks that will make it into my Top 100 most played on my Zune. I listen to them almost every day. Overall, amazing album! If you liked their previous works, especially In Silico, then you will love this. I would recommend that anyone interested in this genre of music give it a try.

B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|Neon Genesis Evangelion is needless to say one of the most controversial anime franchises of ALL TIME as well as one of the most amazing animes of all time. The original series came out in 1995 which composed of 26 episodes which combined great elements of any anime series with a nice blend of action and comedy; however, the series is overall depressing and moody. Those original 26 episodes were classic needless to say however, episodes 25 and 26 were one of the most confusing and complex endings of any anime series. What the Evangelion series is famous for is the connection with religion and human emotions, it is one of the most depressing anime series because it goes deep into the mental state of human emotions and purpose and life. Life and Death is the overall content of the series. The last 2 episodes was confusing and basically one big mind f***. 2 years later the director Hideaki Anno decided to redue the ending and make a whole theatrical movie entitled The End of Evangleion and that ending was much much better, and the overall result was aclaimed and critically accecpted by all viewers. Over a decade later Hideaki Anno decides to revamp the ENTIRE series into a 4-Part movie and create a whole new plot and ending to the series.<br /><br />This movie is a retelling of the first original 6 episodes of the original series. Alhought the whole Rebuild of Evangelion is a retelling of the original series, this first movie is basically the same exact story from the original series but with new animation and condensed into a 2 hour movie. The overall result is fantastic, the new animation is silky smooth combined with new CGI animations and colorful textures to make the film more modern and tolerable comapared to the 90's adaption. The story in this movie remains the same, a new Eva pilot Shinji Ikari is called upon by his father to pilot the Evangelion and kill off the upcoming angels. Nothings new here except for the new animated sequences. The music is very familiar from the original series and the dialogue has remained basically the same as well. Although the general material has been altered, its just nice to see a more modern Evangelion and really gets you hyped up for the next movies coming in the near future.<br /><br />This DVD Evangleion 1.11 contains the same material from the original release 1.01 except for an additional second included with a couple of extras. The movie also contains an additional scenes added to the movie, nothing crucially important but it is a nice feature. The second disc contains a the original 1.01 feature film release (minus the added scenes) as well as couple of previews for the next film. The DVD also contains a 20 page booklet with notes and other great stuff on it. The movie is great, but the only reason why I give the film 4 stars is because of the English dub. I was a fan of the original series, and I found the english dub in the original series to be well done and can't imagine any other voice actors to do those characters. However, in the Rebuild series only two voice actors reprise their roles from the original series which are Spike Spencer (Shinkji Ikari) and Allison Keith (Misato Katsuragi). I am very glad at LEAST these two came back but I am a little dissapointed the original english voice actors from the NERV members didn't come back especially the voice for Gendo and Ritsuko. Hopefully the voice for Asuka will come back for the next film, and if she doesn't then I am watching the next film in japanese. This disc is a must buy for me. Great Movie but the special features fall short. I cannot wait till the next movie comes out.the original series and the dialogue has remained basically the same as well.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Brick is a modern day film noir set in a high school in California. That may, or may not, attrack people to this movie. For some, like me, who really don't care about the film noir genre of the 40's and 50's (mostly because of the outlandish characters and over the top plots) may find this a refreshing alternate on that genre. Sure the characters speak in a way that's not like real life, but the true gem of this movie is it's brilliant storytelling with likeable characters that don't seem too far fetched.  Brendan is the loner (only after Emily leaves him) who seems to know how the world works, but keeps himself away from it unless he needs it. Emily is the femme fatale who wants in on the upper crowds, but gets herself into more than she can handle. Tug is the muscle without a brain. The pin is the crimeboss with some quirky personality traights.  This movie is definately one worth watching just to see the spin that is put onto the characters, for instance: a scene that involves Brendan being treated to a meal by the Pin's mother just after he was beaten in their cellar. It's an interesting idea and works incredibly well for the tone of the movie.  This is an excellent movie worth every amount of praise it receives, and I am personally looking forward to more from Rian Johnson.
B004B4RCDE|5.0|I get annoyed when I hear complaints of \\"Rihanna cant sing\\". You dont have to have an operatic voice to be called a  good singer. Pop artists have to be able to carry a tune and sing songs that others want to hear. Rihanna goes way beyond that.    Rihanna has a distinct voice, which is what sets her apart from the countless other soundalike music acts out there. It is refreshing to hear her songs and not have to guess who it might be. She and her Management have a knack for writing and picking melodic and memorable songs that fit her voice and are great for radio,parties and club listening. Her music also crosses style, race and age boundaries like few other artist can. Her appeal is worldwide and the sales prove it.    Loud is as good as a Pop album can be. Every song is a potential single or at least sing-a-long fun. To me it is comparable to Good Girl Gone Bad. All of the songs are good. The main difference is in the content of the lyrics. The sexual side is a little more direct instead of hinted at(S&M, Skin).  At first listen, you may not agree with my glowing review. You have to give it a few listens. Buy this set and you will grow to love it!    There are several other reviews that do a great job analyzing each song individually.     I would like to see \\"Skin\\" as the 4th single. It may get banned in several countries too. That sells records(sorry, they are still records to me). And... the video could be awesome!

B001GGZJ08|5.0|This is the greatest CCR album. Recorded a few months before the Woodstock Festival of 1969, this has to be one of the best roots rock albums of all time (arguably the best rock album of 1969). John Fogerty sounds better than even his previous album, Bayou Country. Green River, a song about Fogerty's childhood in California, kicks off the album in style. All songs on the album, with the exception of \\"Night Time is the Right Time\\", were written and sung by John Fogerty. Bad Moon Rising is also featured on the album, and it is one of the greatest singles of the late 1960s. You will hear lots of strong, solid guitar solos, along with Fogerty's vibrant, energetic voice. Absolute must-have for CCR fans and all rock music fans
B004J64QSI|4.0|Excellent and enjoyable production.  Don't really understand the overblown criticism of Nick Jonas, who I thought did a fine job.  Just a quick note for those who weren't aware, Mr. Jonas began his career on broadway as a child in NYC, so I wouldn't consider him unversed in theatre.  And I am not a teenager, I am far past it.

0060751967|1.0|I am really curious about all the high ratings for this book.  The premise was actually quite interesting and the H was likable.  What brought my entire entertainment to a screeching halt was how unbelievably irritating the h was.  About a third of the way in, I found myself rolling my eyes and saying, 'shut up you, annoying twit!'  She's supposed to be a dentist which, I'm assuming involves brains and intelligence, yet she seemed void of both.  The man saves her and how does she show her gratitude? Gets bossy, huffy, etc.  Ugh.  I wanted to scream at her asking \\"who ARE you?!  You just met him about 2 hours ago and you're telling him how to run his security!\\"  She has the Russian mob after her and she's behind of fortress of armed guards yet she wants to leave.  Childish temper tantrum.  Sorry.  I'm about suspension of belief but I find it hard to believe someone would put her anguished feelings for a guy she met less than 24 hours prior over her own life.      And all the \\"God's blood\\" comments were just too much.  I found that incredibly irritating.    Not a fan.  I may give another book in the series a chance, but this one just didn't do it for me.

B000FC12YQ|4.0|I've never read Agatha Christy - embarrassed to say - but I'm glad I did.  Obviously it's a bit of a time warp in terms of dialect but after getting used to this, the book is definitely fun to read with a great ending.  I should have seen it coming but I think I've been conditioned by Hollywood.  Anyway, I don't want to talk much about what happens at the end so enough said.<br /><br />Christy does a great job of keeping you guessing, never really giving you the full picture until the last few chapters.  Oh, and it must be said, this is really a quick read and in my opinion should be called a \\"short story.\\"  And I swear, the Parker Brothers must've read this short story and immediately created the game Clue - who killed so and so in the parlor!<br /><br />Bottom line: would I recommend it?  Yep.  It's quick, fun a great change of pace from the novels of today.
0142403873|5.0|One usually considers picture books to be written for children but Julia Donaldson definitely, definitely must have had bored parents in mind when she wrote these delightful tales, The Gruffalo and the The Gruffalo's Child. The twists and turns are clever to say the least and the humour will have you all giggling away!      The Gruffalo is definitely my 3 year old's favourite book and he knows much of it off by heart! The movie has extended the story a bit but still holds true to the original!      Must look....good books, most libraries should have copies of these modern classics, but you can't beat having your own copy for daily use. It deals with facing one's fears and finding original solutions in a very clever way. ]It also brings home the point that some fears are are imagined and not real.

B002ZG99TK|3.0|Unstoppable is indeed very stoppable, and blessedly so; hitting pause while going to get a beer has rarely felt like such a relief. The first hour is so full of modern film cliches that it was just plain annoying:<br /><br />-Shaky Hand-Cam TM that's supposed to make you feel excited but just makes you feel ill<br />-pointlessly sudden close-ups that achieve the same effect as the shaky hand-cam<br />-unbelievably manipulative music that tells you what you're supposed to feel just before you could ever actually feel it from what's on screen...and way louder than the dialogue so you have to lunge for the remote or have your eardrums assaulted<br />-brief and all-too-standard character bios that reveal the same tired character types, especially the young married couple on the rocks (gee, all they need is a good disaster to rekindle their love!)<br />-product placement galore (like we don't get enough Faux News in \\"reality\\" these days?)<br />-etc etc<br /><br />Scott and Denzel hit a home run with Man On Fire but have since tried variations on that pattern to ever-less success, and Unstoppable is so formulaic that these two seem to be on auto-pilot. Yes, it's based on a true story, but there are so many hackneyed tropes here that it might as well be entirely fake, I mean fictional.<br /><br />[Spoilers] The train literally turns the magic final curve on half its wheels?! Are you kidding? Why not have Superman come down and set it straight while you're at it? Ridiculous. Either you're going for realism, or you're not. Which is it?<br /><br />We're told the train is going 71 mph and is 10 miles from the next Big Event...and then it takes 20 minutes to get there, with no apparent back-time shots, etc. What, we can't do math?<br /><br />The tv helicopter hovers over the entire ride and almost hits the rescue chopper...and not one person ever mentions the danger or stupidity of that? Come on.<br /><br />Denzel is just getting lazy, or maybe he has no acting chops any more, or something, because every role he takes seems to require less and less thought and feeling, with the script supplying all the dramatic movement while DW just grimaces and looks fully committed to whatever crazy stunt he's about to let his stunt double do. Speaking of which, the hopping across trains at 75 mph at 60 years old with nary a hitch? Pull the other one.<br /><br />Pine is fine but feels like Paul Walker or any other of the new blond pretty boys who think scowling equals acting. Ditto most of the other actors here: bland. It just never felt right or real, but instead like a movie hyping itself at every turn.<br /><br />The final 20 minutes are better than the rest, but not by much. The final screen shot showing that Denzel's character got his full pension back is so funny it's a joke. The guy saves the entire company and gets a pat on the back? Believable, but for the movie to show it as some sort of justice is, like so much of this predictable Hollywood tripe, self-defeating.<br /><br />I love popcorn movies, and this is surely one, but both the director and star can do SO much better. Too bad they're just going for the easy money now.<br /><br />Speaking of which, this blu-ray package is a rip-off at 39, or even 20.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|WOW! I just got done watching this about an hour ago, and I just want to say that I was completely taken aback. THIS. WAS. STELLAR! I just couldn't believe how amazing everything was. I know everyone is saying that Nick Jonas was horrible, but he did the best that he could and he really wasn't that bad! Everyone else was just simply amazing, and there were many times when I found myself holding back tears, especially when the 4 Valjean's sang Bring Him Home. If you're a fan of Les Mis, and are HESITANT about buying this. DONT BE! This is amazing, and I'll probably watch this over and over again!

To a generation that was born about the time that that twerp, J Bon Jovi, was first being taken seriously, it's awfully hard to demonstrate that the Stones are (WERE?)

There is plenty of action and many questions hang as the book ends.  I think this second book is even better than the first!<br /><br />Looking forward to The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest!
B002WY65VU|3.0|I love zombies movies, but this movie just didn't entertain me. I wanted the story to be centered around zombies, this movie is just a romance-action movie with not  enough zombies. I can't believe people thought this movie was funny, I thought it was really boring except for a couple parts. I did enjoy the beginning and the last ten minutes, but I found the middle of the movie really boring. I really liked \\"Shawn of the Dead\\", but I didn't like this movie that much. The zombie kills in this movie were done really well, but the plot is just stupid and isn't funny.<br /><br />In my opinion, Shawn of the Dead and Dawn of the Dead(2004) are way better zombie movies and they have way better comedy too. I'm really disappointed with this movie since it has high ratings.
0670022411|5.0|I just finished reading this book and had to share my enthusiasm for it!

1439152780|3.0|I finished THE DISTANT HOURS a couple of weeks ago and have been trying to assemble my thoughts on this book in order to write a review.  I enjoyed Kate Morton's first two books, THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON and THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN, so I had been looking forward to her latest offering with great anticipation.  Her previous books had illustrated Ms. Morton's understanding of the tender intricacies of love and family relationships and her proficiency with vivid imagery.  I reveled in her unique ability to compose a narrative so compelling it was capable of transporting me to another time and place.<br /><br />The premise of DISTANT HOURS was promising, a fifty year old letter delivered to an unsuspecting recipient, three strange sisters residing in a decrepit old castle, the genesis of a children's fairy tale, an unusual bequest, unrequited love, and a daughter's attempt to uncover the secret memories and previously unknown details of her mothers past.  There is a lot of story here, perhaps too much.  At 555 pages the book could have benefited from some astute and well advised editing.<br /><br />The novel utilizes multiple narrators to tell its story and moves between WWII and 1993.  The writing is atmospheric and many of the passages peppered here and there throughout the novel are positively poetic.  For all of those positive aspects, the multiple storyline never fulfills its early promise and ends up resembling a big beautiful red balloon that suddenly develops a slow leak.  It floats, it glides and ultimately it falls to earth....unable to maintain its buoyancy.<br /><br />Perhaps this is one of those instances where the reader's expectations are so high, based upon previous experiences with the author's offerings, that those expectations are impossible to fulfill.  I wanted this book to be a five, I was expecting a five, but I barely got a three.
B001HN69B8|3.0|In `The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' we see the Doctor, who made a bet with the devil, fight to keep his daughter out of his clutches.  Through a variety of bets the Doctor and devil interact and fight for the souls of viewers of the doctors travelling carnival show, within which the Doctor can guide their imaginations.<br /><br />Despite being set in the present time this film has lots of fantasy elements and as we have come to expect from Terry Gilliam, some of these can be a touch bizarre or disquieting.  Also some of these fantasy scenes are a touch `python-esque' as well, especially where there is a troop of dancing policemen in fish-net tights!!<br /><br />Heath Ledger is very good in his role and his untimely death during filming is dealt with as well as can be in the circumstance and Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell all step in to fulfil the role he starts.<br /><br />However good this film is, I also found it quite disjointed and the fantasy aspects don't sit well next to the present day scenes.  For films where this is carried out to perfection see `The Fall' which blends the present day and fantasy scenes with mastery and skill.  Also, sadly, due to Ledgers death his character never feels fully rounded and you never fully appreciate what drives him throughout the film.  I think some of my ambivalence towards this film is that I never fully cared what happened to any of the characters, I happily watched them on screen, but wasn't bothered what happened to them one way or the other.  Saying this Andrew Garfield played his role excellently and there is some good acting from all involved.<br /><br />All in all this is a good film, but it feels as if something key to it's success is lacking. It passed the time well enough and I enjoyed it for the duration of the viewing, but it's not one I'll rush to watch again any time soon.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0000AMRJD|2.0|Oops! Did I make a big mistake! I purchased both versions of the Scarface movie,  (Full screen and Wide screen) and did not like the Full screen version at all.  Images were missing and the picture was not sharp. It was kind of fuzzy. The  Wide screen was perfect. There was more images and detail and the picture was  clear and sharp! A greater viewing accuracy.
159102594X|3.0|The Best:  The characters and dialog are great in this book.  I found myself very interested in the lives of the characters and there where many moments I laughed.      Annoyances: In the book we see 3 major cultures and nations.  They have different lifestyles, different beliefs, and different languages.  It really takes me out of he world when all of these very different cultures all use the \\"F\\" word and Sh$% constantly. It's really just silly and stupid.  For some reason every single language uses the \\"F\\" word....a lot.  Its like watching a play of Romeo and Juliet and having them say \\"awesome\\" in it.  It ruins the fantasy world building.    The Bad:  Joe is a great writer but does not build a compelling fantasy world. Lack of descriptions, no imagery.  The world is pretty mundane.  There is a whole race of beings that he you never even know what they look like by the end of the book even though there are encounters with them.    Finally, there are major unexplained plot elements.  A near third of the book is an investigation that adds nothing to the plot.  It is a story arch that, when finished, has done nothing in character development or story.  Maybe it will in future books but not in this one.    SPOILER::::::::  Finally, there's the house of the maker.  The building that's never been opened in history.  It is finally opened and not one word is said about it after the fact.  Seriously????  No one asks about it, no one was there anxiously waiting for them when the finally returned to marvel at the monumental occurrence?  Its like everyone in the book said: \\"Ho hum, the first of the magi has returned and opened a sacred site previously only ever dreamed about, the culmination of thousands of years...oh well, lets get some lunch\\".  Completely stupid and poorly written that part.
B003QCCS36|2.0|First off, Ray Lomantange has an awesome voice - - pure talent.  That is his major strength.  The songwriting here is very MOR - - most of it recalls 70's era singer/songwriters like Joni Mitchell.  Original it is not.  It's all been done before (and much better) so why do it again? \\"Trouble\\" remains his best album - it is outstanding.  Each subsequent release has been less than satisfying.  This album is not bad - - but after you listen to it you really don't feel like you've actually heard anything special.  The band sounds great and Ray's vocals are great - - help is needed in the songwriting department.
0765326353|4.0|One of the great things about Way of Kings is that it is a new original fantasy novel that isn't leaning on the dark and gritty crutch to make it different.    Here is what I say to a person wondering what would make me want to buy this book:    The magic and action are exciting and very visual and come with the fun of seeing and understanding a new world and magic.  After Robert Jordan I wondered if authors would be able to invent a new magic system.  Sanderson does it in every book.  And his magic system has rules.  The rules are laid out and the characters abide by them.  No ambiguous magic system that has unknowable capabilities and limitations.  It makes he world feel more real and interesting.     Way of Kings has great mystery and Sanderson builds great worlds.  You have not seen this world anywhere else.      The book is an like a giant intro but there is a full story arch within the book that makes it feel complete by the end.      This is a great book. But be wary, it is an epic fantasy.  10 books or so.  If thats not for you then stay away.  this book is 1000 pages but it is never dull.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Great show, I really hope HBO picks this back up and runs with it. But for now I suppose the book will do...
0553573403|2.0|I would give it only 1 star but the writing is very good, its just the content that is terrible.  The mass appeal for these books seems to be the same reason over-the-top dramatic shows are so popular.<br /><br />Song of Ice and Fire is basically a soap opera, a softcore porn soap opera.  Lots of unnecessary sex scenes.  Sometimes I wonder if GRRM is a pervert living out fantasies in his books. Sex is a real part of the real world, especially in the brutal uncivilized world he has created but it doesn't need to be explained so explicitly.<br /><br />The writing is engaging and well done but the world and characters are dark and predictable in their unpredictability.  You know that in an attempt to be dark and unpredictable certain things will happen to certain characters.<br /><br />GRRM must also think every one who is good or honorable is naive and stupid.  It gets tiresome reading about the constant deaths and betrayals.<br /><br />As far as the fantasy elements go, there is very little.  The fantasy is very light, not really apart of the story at all.<br /><br />All in all the book, and series, is dark, explicitly and overtly sexual, in no way edifying and seems unnaturally forced to be this way at times. GRRM said he wanted to create a fantasy novel with adult themes.  Why does everyone think adult means, sex, grittiness and darkness?<br /><br />There are better books if you want a new take on the fantasy genre.  What a waste of potential.
B000002MY3|4.0|I was still a teenager when this album came out.  The song you outta know was like a knife in the back when I was dumped.  Alanis has a way with words.<br />The album does have explicit lyrics but it is worth it to get the point across.
B0035G5IOE|2.0|This movie was way too over-hyped.  It just isn't that good.  The stop-motion animation is not charming; it's just jerky.  If you like stop-motion, the Nightmare Before Christmas is a far better example of the genre.  The plot, too, just wasn't that inspiring either.<br /><br />Save your money.  If you're really curious, watch it on cable.
B0026FCNK2|5.0|I love SiFi Flicks that deal with Time Travel, had to pay attention to this, has a very good and unique ending
B004EJ14V2|5.0|This movie is very interesting. If it was a book, I would say a page turner. It is about a girl who is different from everyone else in the school and does not \\"fit\\" in the school. She lies to \\"fit\\" in but the outcome is completely different. I would say watch it! Many of my friends including me watched it and said they liked it too. Watch it!
B0017U7PT6|5.0|Like a mix of Sifi and Fantasy flick, very well done great story from beginning to end, a lot of action.
0307454541|5.0|i heard from my friends that this was a really good book, and it was a really good book. i really liked the lizbeth character, she's the best character in the book and i can't wait to see the movie version to see how she is played. there were lots of twists and turns and i thought all the suspense really built up to a really exciting conclusion. i'm sure this will be a great movie.

Highly recommended!.<br /><br />Just received it yesterday, Thank you Amazon!.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is a very good adventure book. If you are going to read it I would reccomend that you read Percy Jackson and the Olympians first.
0307454541|5.0|I've heard so many people talking about \\"The Girl with Dragon Tattoo\\" that I had to give it a try.  I found it a bit slow for the first 100 pages or so but then extremely interesting.  The book was some of the most interesting and unique characters I've seen a while and Larrson does a fantastic job connecting the reader with them.  The story through some interesting twists, had some great sidelines, and Mikael Blomkvist's love life was \\"different\\" to say the least.  I tended to get a chuckle about the amount of coffee they consume throughout the story.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the book.  For me it offered pure enjoyment and entertainment. It won't let you down, however; you will rush out to buy Steig's second book of the series (In my opinion the best), \\"The Girl who played with Fire\\".
B003V63VNI|4.0|I just got this CD and I really like it, if your a fan of Incubus give it a listen it's mostly accustic so more mellow than Incubus. the songs are solid and I think he did a great job with this and hope he puts out another solo cd
0316098337|1.0|This book was recommended to me by someone whose recommendations in books I never agree with, so I guess I'll stop getting those recommendations! I thought the first part of the book in the \\"room\\" had some consistency and cohesion.  The escape and idea for the escape seemed to come out of nowhere and  was not really plausible. The way the adults around Jack treated him in the real world after the escape seemed as if they were just annoyed by a normal precocious kid rather than being concerned about his adjustment.  After Jack and his mother got out of the \\"room\\" it was a giant let-down.    I realize that the author probably wanted the reader to feel claustrophobic in the \\"room,\\" but it was more a toying with the reader's emotions - one that seems manipulative and contrived using Jack as a vehicle to make us \\"emote.\\"    It's an interesting premise to have the story be told by a 5-year old boy.  I don't think it worked successfully.    This book reminds me to dig deeper than just seeing how popular the book is on Amazon.com, or how many stars it gets.  I was very diasappointed and frankly annoyed that I made myself read the book to it's boring end.
0061726826|5.0|DELIRIUM begins Lauren Oliver's worthy dystopian trilogy about a much-changed world where personal choice is forbidden and love is a crime. Everyone in this civilization will eventually receive the cure for the disease \\"amor deliria nervosa,\\" and suspects displaying early symptoms will be arrested and face immediate surgery.    Lena Haloway is among the droves of sensible, average 17-year-olds who anticipate a cure for the disease called \\"love.\\" Her nerve-wracking procedure is scheduled in several weeks; though anxious about the interview and pain, she's looking forward to the end of social judgments. To her knowledge, she has never been infected with this disease. Her mother, however, was labeled a troublemaker after becoming delirious and finally succumbing to suicide. The cure had failed to work properly on her after her husband's death from cancer, leaving her able to continue to show love even after the procedure was forced upon her repeatedly. Eventually she chose the only way out she could.    Now under the care of their frosty and predictable aunt and uncle, Lena and her sisters are trying (unsuccessfully) to adapt to their new home and to be content. Since moving in, they've been taught to accept love as deadly, the cause of sensitive and destructive feelings that all lead to a degenerating, serious mental illness. Love's various symptoms are easily recognized and are taboo. Anyone unfortunate or foolish enough to have contrary perceptions faces imprisonment or repeating the procedure. The government advertises this approach as positive, translating to a more stable and peaceful populace and adults who enjoy lives free of stress, pain and worry. Anyone who has ever received the cure ceases to care about being desirable, having dreams, or even fitting in socially. These kinds of concerns simply become trivial once all is said and done.    Detailed information on the actual procedure is not readily available, yet presumably the alteration involves some destruction or removal of a part of the brain. Scars on the head leave permanent impressions of a painful entry and cause the uncured some concern, but post-procedurally, patients display an altered affect and steady personality. Few cases exist where this hasn't worked the first time as the procedure is, by definition, permanent. Never again do men and women feel impassioned or excited; citizens are more productive and responsible.    Venturing outside boundaries --- either structural or intellectual --- is a criminal offense in this place. Every aspect of the media, television, literature and Internet is monitored. Teenagers never kiss or date, and there are no crushes (or at least none that are acknowledged). The only ones testing boundaries are children awaiting a cure, a circumstance deemed \\"forgivable\\" because they are weak and \\"prone to emotional swings.\\" Adolescents have curfews and are routinely monitored for signs of infection. On the surface, the system seems to provide an answer to some of the world's imperfections. Yet there are persistent whispers of outsiders living in the wilds just beyond the boundaries of city walls. People say they are only animals, once hunted and slaughtered in droves. To this day, no one ventures outside, and rumors remain of \\"invalids\\" living in the wilderness, apparently unstable and teeming with disease.    Following the first few chapters of DELIRIUM, readers will recognize in Lauren Oliver's particular brand of dystopia some ingenious ideas. Numerous parallels and messages exist that reflect on the boundaries and expectations we set for ourselves. There are obvious dangers in setting such rigid extremes as a means of controlling people, and yet by the end, readers will find it not at all impossible that such a society could exist. The romance, though well done, is one that will appeal mostly to teenage audiences, though the dystopian framework makes it a more versatile and challenging read for a broader audience.         --- Reviewed by Melanie Smith
0670022411|1.0|I love, love and I really LOVE fantasy, so I just knew this would be a winner...I couldn't have been more wrong.  The character does nothing interesting, we watch in great detail when she chooses what to wear, we follow her to the library while she studies, we follow her to the coffee store and to yoga...and nothing happens not even a steamy passionate love affair with a vampire.  Save your time and money and just follow a librarian on Twitter.

B0040QYROA|5.0|This version of Metropolis is about as complete as you will ever get....just the story behind how the remaining pieces of the movie were discovered and restored is amazing. The story is, of course, a classic. Robots before Asimov? Wow. As with any great sci-fi movie, this primodial work uses technology as the vehicle to expound upon sociological philosophy. One cannot say they are a master of literature without watching and understanding this movie.
0743297334|5.0|I had to take a break from reading Joyce's [[ASIN:014118311X Finnegans Wake]] so I figured Hemingway's 'The Sun Also Rises' would be an appropriately light antididonai for the heavy soup of Joyce. I think I liked The Sun Also Rises' just slightly more than [[ASIN:0684801469 A Farewell To Arms]]. I thought both novels were near masterpieces, but I appreciated the characters in this novel just slightly more than those in Hemingway's next novel. Brett and Jake are amazing characters. The setting and the action of this corrida of a novel were perfectly timed and beautifully executed.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|This really is an amazing movie -- Hollywood could learn a lot from Departures. A solid, emotional story that needs no special effects or CGI. Japan probably isn't the first country you think of when thinking about a movie full of emotion, but this may change your mind and make you want to explore similar movies. It's also a great movie for seeing everyday, non-tourist Japan if you've never been there. The soundtrack is amazing, and you can't help but love the ending of this movie. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
B004MMEIK0|5.0|Love at stake happens to be one of my favorite series. Book one being one of the best. I love the characters, especially Shanna. She is witty with a sense of humor and perfect for Roman. Sparks did a good job created Shanna's character. I have re-read this book three times and have enjoyed it each time I've read it. It's cute and romantic is a whimsical sort of way.

B003M5AXN4|4.0|There is not much to the plot. And just by picking up the case, you will know whether or not you want to watch it. The Wachowskis do not measure up in terms of value or story in this one, but most people expect that walking in. But the dazzling colors that drench every scene in the most beautiful way will keep your eyes wide open for each frame. Personally, I would recommend the Blu-Ray version. It is a perfect goofy action movie, for kids and those who know how to act like kids. No more and no less
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I went into this movie not expecting much, but was pleasently surprised.  Good life lessons & it was not full of the unneccessary \\"stealth\\" adult humour that too many children's movies are riddled with.

0380807343|5.0|coraline is a very scary book. but I like that stuff. I'ts about a young girl named coraline who get's trapped in the other mother's world. I personly think it was one of my favorite books of all time.   If you are someone who's quite brave to read at night, this book is your choice. but let me tell you something I saw the movie before I read the book so I thought it was a little confuseing but you can watch the movie first or read it first.     coraline o it's so magnifesent. read it. you won't regret reading it because its so good.  the movie is just as good as the book. but a little diffrent.  anyway back to the book. when the book is almost about to end she set's a trap for the other mother's hand (it was cut of when coraline shut the door and her hand broke off).     I hope you enjoyed my review and get the book as soon as you can and read it!
B004G600A4|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! I don't understand how the Academy could have overlooked it. It was so much better than Toy Story 3 and the SKG Dragon movie! I am so glad I didn't see this in the theatre, I cried my eyes out for the last 15 or 20 minutes. It was a fun action movie with a wonderful love story. My 14 year old daughter hates Disney princesses, but loved this movie, she's demanded to watch it every day! My husband also loved it. It's a great family movie with wonderful Alan Menken music! I highly recommend it.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|I waited for DVD before seeing this movie.  I'm glad I did because rewatching it in the theater would have cost me $10 a pop instead of just pressing the play button over-and-over.  It's very quirky but good natured.  It kind of reminds me of high-school in the 80's...except there's Internet.  I'm not a movie critic...well...I don't get paid to write reviews of movies but there are at least 5 characters in this movie that could hold an audience for 2 hours; this movie just happened to be about Napoleon.
B0048LPRCS|3.0|What do you call a good movie that is MORE THAN AN HOUR TOO LONG?    Certainly, not \\"good\\". I´d call it repetitious, slow, unnecesary, irritating, tedious...    Ironically, the movie credits are probably the FASTEST in history...    Not a terrible movie, but it could have been excelent if it wasn´t more than 2 and a half hours long

B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I'll just start out with, I LOVE Adele. I've been waiting for this sophomore album before she even announced the title and release date. So needless to say I was counting down until February 22. I have been soaking everything that she has released pre-release date. When 'Rolling in the Deep' was released, I knew that '21' was going to be a killer. The album is an instant classic. It's number one in over ten countries, which shows her music touches emotions in people everywhere.     Adele's music is so personal and emotional. Her music is written from personal experiences, and as you listen to this album you can definitely feel that. (I hope she never stops writing like that.) I love how she is so honest in her music; it allows you to be a part of her for a time. She sings these personal songs with raw emotions, as if she is re-living these experiences each time she sings them. Personally, I have a greater appreciation for an artist who writes from personal experiences, i.e. a breakup. The music means so much more then, case in point '21'. Every song on this record conveys her emotions so well and each is delivered with soul and passion. If you check out her live performance of 'Someone Like You' at the Brits, it is evident that her broken relationship is still extremely real to her.     This album reaches me on so many levels. When she sings 'Don't You Remember' and 'Someone Like You', I want to cry/beg/plead along with her. As 'Rolling in the Deep' plays, I'm about to go slash some tires or something. (side note - I do prefer a live version of 'Don't You Remember'. I think the album version has to much fluff. It's good fluff but to much. Adele needs nothing but her voice to make a song a hit.) Her voice is incredible: anger, passion, love, regret - she does it all. She has talent that hasn't been seen in a long time. Adele set the bar so high on '19' but somehow she raises it even more with '21'. Can you imagine what the third album is going to be like!? I can't wait. Soak up everything she does and buy her album. Let me break it down for you... basically, Adele is THE SH**!

0061726826|5.0|DELIRIUM is one of the best books I've read in a while and definitely a new favorite series of mine.<br /><br />Amor Deliria Nervosa (the disease that is love), is now curable.. and you will be cured weather you want to be or not, because love is dangerous and deadly and against the law.<br />Love is the root of all evil, without it there is no passion and no jealousy resulting in less crime, addiction, depression, divorce... a much happier society, right?... or just a numb one?<br />The US government has taken every caution to prevent \\"infection\\"... very much a police state situation; with male/female segregation, indoctrination, all media censorship, closed and guarded boarders, regulators watch the streets and those suspected of being \\"sympathizers\\" are raided in their homes to be executed or locked away in the depths of the Crypt.<br /><br />Just shy of 18, Lena has not had the easiest life and is looking forward to her upcoming birthday and the procedure that will cure her. Soon she will be evaluated for a career, cured and paired with a husband.  Her life will finally begin, free of pain and safe from \\"infection\\"... but a lot can happen in a few months and Lena's whole world is turned upside down when she meets Alex.<br /><br />Such a consuming read with a powerful message, DELIRIUM is truly one that's hard to put down. Lauren Oliver does an exquisite job with this beautifully written dystopian book and what looks to be shaping up to be an intoxicating new series. Three books came to mind when reading DELIRIUM... Ally Condie's MATCHED, Teri Hall's THE LINE and Scott Westerfeld's UGLIES (thought Lena had a little Tally Youngblood going on).  If you enjoyed any of those books, you're sure to be easily drawn into Oliver's provoking and tragic world right up to the crushing end... and left eager for more.
B00394A4UK|4.0|Dennis Lehane has had some critically acclaimed books that have been made into movies including this one starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Gone Baby Gone starring Ben Affleck & Morgan Freeman and Mystic River starring Sean Penn & Tim Robbins who both won Academy Awards for their roles in that movie. This is what seduced me into reading this book.<br /><br />I thought this book was a little predictable, but it was so well written that this didn't particularly bother me. Sometimes the journey is just as enjoyable as the destination.<br />Even though it doesn't take an Einstein to guess the \\"twist\\" at the end, there are minor twists & explanations which still got me by surprise particularly in relation to the codes that make this book a cut above and ultimately a satisfying read.
B000000OMP|5.0|The Slide It In Album is one of Whitesnakes' best! Every song is good and is easy listening. Highlights are \\"Love Ain't No Stranger, the title track, \\"Slow 'An Easy\\", \\"Guilty Of Love\\" and \\"Give Me More Time\\". They say that David Coverdale and Whitesnake are a knock off of Zepplin, well I don't hear that at all, and frankly he was in Deep Purple at the same time Zepplin was rocking the world. David Coverdale is a original who has gotten better with time. I wish they got their due in America earlier because their songs are timeless. Slide It In is one of the best rock records of the mid 80's.
B0019CB5T8|5.0|I'm not easily scared by a movie, but this one did.  What really scares you in this movie is that it is a true story. It did happened.  There was nothing special about the haunted girl or her family: they were just like you and me, or the family next door.  The realization that demonic possession happens randomly makes this movie uncomfortably scary. It does make you think when the lights go off.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've been a big fan of Adele since she released 19. It was an amazing record, well deserving of the critical acclaim and awards. Keeping that in mind, 21 blows it out of the water. Adele's lyrics and style have vastly improved and the production value on this album is great. It is a must buy.
0553582038|4.0|After reading through the reviews I was prepared to be disappointed   with this book. Initialy I was but the more I read the more I understood    that the author was fleshing out the world of fire and ice. There are always   players who seem minor that in the end are players, and players that have    failed. I for one was very happy with the book and now know there are many,   many, many people in Martin's world who may, after all, play a major (?) part.      There are more than a few major characters that were barely mentioned in the    earlier books that are shaping up to be true forces as the story moves ahead.      The above said, I am concerned about the lack of info on the next book in the series and hope   that the HBO planned series on 'The Game of Thrones' has taken precidence.
B002SF9YUM|3.0|I admit I ordered this DVD partially out of curiosity (can Robert Pattinson really act? yes, actually) and also because I was familiar with Lorca and Dali, but little more than that.  Overall, I'm torn over it.  The cinematography is exceptional, creating a very beautiful film.  The setting, the time period, the costuming - all well done.  The dialog is somewhat sparse - there are long instances where there is little or no talking - but woven throughout are excerpts from Lorca's poetry that really add to the mood and tone.  The acting is superb, especially the leads, Robert Pattinson and Javier Beltran.  I was surprised at how they disappeared into their roles, even more so for Pattinson.  I feel he had the more challenging role in bringing the eccentric, brilliant and somewhat unhinged Dali to life.<br /><br />The story is alternately angst-ridden, languid and intense. However, the movie is incredibly slow.  Almost tortuously slow at times.  I think the filmmakers intended to show the gradual growth of feeling between the two men, but sometime I felt like I was looking at a lovely painting instead of a living story.  There are some very intense scenes, in particular when Dali and Lorca attempt to have sex without really taking the reality of it into account.  This scene was gut-wrenching and emotional, but there were too few scenes of such intensity.  Overall, fans of historical and/or biographical films who have a lot of patience may find this rewarding.  I thought it was a good film, but not one I would watch again.
B002ZG981E|2.0|The movie is science fiction dealing with dreams being able to alter, or not alter, reality. It has a good cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger and cameos by Michael Caine. DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, who is to pull information, through dreams, from the subconscious of their subjects. Cobb is also tortured by personal turmoil in the death of his wife & not being able to see his kids. The premise here is if he pulls off his mission successfully he will be reunited with his two children. The kids make spotty appearances throughout the movie, but Cobb can only see their backs; not their faces.<br /><br />Cobb's mission is to use his ability to alter the subconscious mind of his foe's son, resulting in the collapse an empire controlled by the son & ailing father.<br /><br />The plot is intriguing, but the screenplay kills it. The acting in the movie is good. DiCaprio plays his character well. Levitt has matured very well since his days on TV's 3rd Rock From the Sun. Michael Caine is always a grand addition to a cast. Alas, the actors can't save this movie.<br /><br />It's a cross between action & mind games. The result is a very confusing movie which sinks like a stone. The screenplay is awful. I gave it two stars due to the acting of the cast. Try as they may, the movie is an awful confusion. The flick is worth one star. Skip this one
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is one of the most absorbing videos I have ever watched. I highly recommend this version -- the BBC production narrated by David Attenborough. There is a Discovery Channel edition narrated by Sigourney Weaver. I am sure Ms. Weaver did just as commendable a narration, but the BBC's edition includes a behind-the-scenes/how-it-was-done video following each chapter. Those vignettes are fascinating.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This movie is bad not because it appears to be shot on a shoe string budget.  Or the make up on the creature Grendel looks like the Gico caveman if he ate lead paint as a child. It's basically a giant rasta wig!?!  I can even overlook the bad special effects.  It's the horrible acting by all, except maybe Gerard Butler (and I'm being biased) that make this a bad movie.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|When the previous reviewer complains that we should all be content to view the original Star Wars Trilogy on the poor quality DVD's Lucas threw out a few years back he misses the mark.  What the original reviewer may not realize is that Lucs just dumped the original trilogy on DVD without it being anamorphically \\"enhanced\\" as most modern DVD's are -which maximizes their video quality.  He used the same transfers used for Laserdisc, simply to try to quell the many who were upset -and to stop the *bootlegs* on sale for years. The films at least should be allowed to be seen on BLU Ray in the original format as many have clamored for online in campaigns (thank you thedigitlabits.com ) for years. Lucas can still rake in many millions more by doing this.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|In Treatment in a show that could only exist on HBO.  The show is, for all intents and purposes, an episodic play.  Rarely do the characters leave the confines of Paul's (Gabriel Byrne) therapy room.  The show is all about characters, creating dimension to each person, be it a seemingly selfish father, a stoic corporate worker, or an unlikeable attorney.  The show strives for artistic integrity, and barely has any viewers when it airs (hence it could only be on HBO).<br /><br />With regards to Season 2, the show felt more real and organic, relying less on surprising twists and connections between the multiple patients, and was more about treating the patients, as well as dealing with Paul's own demons.  If you enjoyed the first season, I can easily recommend season 2.  It makes both references to the first, and provides a better crafted season.  The show is mesmerizing, and very well acted.  I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for great television.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|Not bad, but I still prefer the original. One thing I dislike about CG effects is the predictable motion style. Those quick jerky movements just don't seem real to me. Many films using CG fall into this trap. On one level, it's interesting that she can move like a quick spider, but it just looks like so many other CG effects. Of course that's a tiny part of the film, but it sticks in my mind as a weak point. In the original she just drops from a tree or something, and it flowed better (for me). That touch of obvious digital articulation in the re-make took me out of the movie for a second. This is worth a look, but I'd check out the original if you get a chance.
1594202842|5.0|Maybe it's because my parents were immigrants as well, but I understand what Chua was trying to do. And yes, it involves some ego on the part of the parent ... but who doesn't beam with pride when their child says \\"thank you\\" or \\"please\\" to another adult? Or feel mortified when their children DON'T do that? Those of us who were raised in old-school households think it; Chua has the guts to admit it. If you were raised a different way, I can understand why this book would seem extreme to you. But there's no perfect recipe for raising a child and that's what Chua learned in the end.   Regardless of how you feel about her, Chua clearly got the big things right. Lulu didn't ditch the violin to run off and join a drug cartel. She traded it in for tennis and then applied what she'd learned from her parents -- hard work, humility and courage -- to fight for her own future.

1439177783|4.0|I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but 4 won out because this book stuck with me for so long after.  I cannot believe Portia made it through this terrible disease - to the point where I hope she is honestly okay since she was so good about hiding it.  I agree with other reviewers that it is a little repetitious but I thought her writing was beautiful.  I will also agree that it can seem like an anorexic how-to guide but it really made me feel what she went through and I think it needed to be said for those who, thankfully, haven't gone through this.  I came away thinking that Hollywood standards are even worse (I'm not saying all stars have an eating disorder just that the things she was told are outrageous) and I pray that my children don't want to go into this arena.
1594202842|3.0|Having just seen the movie \\"Race to Nowhere\\", and having just finished reading Chua's book, I can't imagine any parent putting their children through such rigid instruction. In \\"Race to Nowhere\\", children are portrayed as stressed and over-scheduled almost to the point of suicide. I compared the serious issues from the movie with Chua's parenting methods and can't believe any child would be happy with such a strict need for performance. Personally, I think children who are raised under the pressures of competition tend to be very intelligent, but unfortunately they have little creativity and/or personality. They may be smart, but they are boring.
0393338827|5.0|I am a Republican and before reading this book I tended to put the entire blame for this crisis on the politicians who changed the mortgage rules and forced financial institutions to make mortgage loans to anyone that could breathe.  I now see that this was also a major fraud perpetrated by firms like Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and others who created out of thin air phony securities for the subprime mortgage market rated as double AA investments which were then sold to the unsuspecting public worldwide.  Enhancing this fraud were the bond rating agencies which rated this garbage as no risk investments similar to U.S. government bonds.    What this really was was a gigantic Wall Street Ponzi scheme which was a hundred times worse than what Bernie Madoff did.  Ironically the people who perpetrated this fraud are still there creating new fraudulent financial instruments and NOBODY HAS GONE TO JAIL.  These millionaires and billionaires not only run Wall Street but they also run the government which is supposed to be the public's watchdog and did absolutely nothing to protect us, it only protected the crooks.      Michael does a great job of describing both the fraudsters and the incompetent hacks that populate Wall Street.  Particularly entertaining was his story of the Morgan Stanley bond trader who was making twenty five million dollars a year and ended up causing the firm to lose nine billion dollars.  This is a well written and investigated book, I only wish I would have understood some of this myself three or four years ago, if I had, I too would have been a millionaire.
B000063CMK|5.0|Some people will inevitably disagree with my above statement, but though some of the ones after this were good, I personally thought none quite reached the level of this album (which I'm actually rating a 4.5) or its equally awesome predecessor, \\"The Perfect Element 1\\".  That aside though, this is easily one of POS's best albums, and features a double whammy of impressively technical musicianship and emotional, intelligent lyrics that touch on a number of different themes such as suicide, a miscarriage, love, lost love, and others.  Singer/Songwriter Daniel Gildenlow is in top form here, and his performance is what makes the album as great as it is.  That's not to say that the other members are extraneous though, as they each have a moment to shine on here at one point or another (The drum part at the beginning of \\"Rope Ends\\" is particularly impressive).  \\"Remedy Lane\\" is very much a progressive metal album, but don't expect the likes of Symphony X or Dream Theater.  Pain of Salvation is very much its own beast.  If you're curious about individual tracks though, look here:    1. Of Two Beginnings (10/10) - Essentially just an intro, this track is short but pretty and segways right into the next one nicely.    2. Ending Theme (10/10) - A slower to mid-paced track, this one has a strange \\"talking\\" section in the middle, but the rest of it more than compensates, with the verses being some of the strongest on the album.    3. Fandango (10/10) - This track may take some time to grow on people because of its odd sound, but I personally think it's one of the best ones on the album.  It has a slightly sinister feel to it that makes it different than the previous 2, and that to me is great.    4. A Trace Of Blood (10/10) - A very sad track about the miscarriage of singer Daniel Gildenlow's baby, this track is one of the longer ones on the album, but is also one of the most impressive.  Gildenlow gives a real tour-de-force here.      5. This Heart Of Mine (I Pledge) (10/10) -A beautiful ballad, this song is softer than any of the ones before it, but just as great.  It IS a little cheesy, but still very much worth hearing.    6. Undertow (10/10) - A very dramatic track, this song builds from being soft to being full on prog metal.  The lyrics here are some of the best on the album in my opinion.  Recommended track.    7. Rope Ends (10/10) - The best track on the album.  Written about the attempted suicide of a friend of the singer's wife, it's one of the album's heaviest moments, but still manages to be beautiful at the same time.  Highly recommended.     8. Chain Sling (10/10) - Very \\"folk music mixed with prog metal\\" sounding, this is one of the critical favorites of this album, and with good reason.  Softer than \\"Rope Ends\\", it's a perfect step after that track's depressive feel.      9. Dryad Of The Woods (8/10) - A pleasant, though non-essential instrumental, this song is softer and features an acoustic sounding guitar backed by the rest of the band and piano.    10. Remedy Lane (6/10) - Another instrumental, this one's not quite as good, and is kind of pointless.  That said, it's not bad and is short enough that it doesn't detract from the album as a whole that much.    11. Waking Every God (9/10) - Another mid-paced track, this one took a while to grow on me.  Once it did though, I saw it for the great song that it is.  The second half solo in particular is a highlight.  Not the best, but certainly impressive.    12. Second Love (9/10) - I didn't like this song at first, but it later grew on me very much.  Written about lost love, it's a little cheesy (just like \\"This Heart of Mine\\"), but not enough that it hurts it.  Again, not the best, but still a good song.      13. Beyond The Pale (9/10) -  The last and longest song on the album, this track is epic in every sense of the word.  It veers between heavy and soft and has some of the most thought provoking lyrics on the whole disc.  I didn't think it was quite as good as some of the earlier ones though, so I didn't give it a perfect score.  A great, though not perfect, way to end the album.     So in the end, if you're a fan of Pain of Salvation already, this album is a must have.  If you're just getting into the band, I recommend starting with either this album or \\"The Perfect Element 1\\", as either will show the band at their best.  Recommended strongly!
B003JSSPSY|1.0|I realize that the TV series is extremely different from (and yes, often contradictory to) the book series - that much was clear throughout the first season. Even so, the mini-plots the writers come up with for episodes are generally pretty entertaining, and I can understand why they would design it that way, given the short-attention-span of most Am-- oh look, a poodle!  Anyway, the characters weren't quite right in the first season, but they are catastrophic in the second. Richard is way too \\"spunky rebel who does whatever he wants because he wants to\\" rather than the mature, independently-thinking hero who was portrayed so aptly in the book series. It's like the basic idea of the character was taken and then everything that really made him special and worth caring about was hollowed out and filled in with modern stereotypes of the teenage male lead.  Darken Rahl, unfortunately, falls into a stereotypical \\"sinister villain\\" role, and with that flattens. He displays none of the mannerisms associated with the character and loses any pretense at emotional motivation for what he does. In the TV series, he's really \\"just\\" some power-hungry guy who was born into power.  Zedd is amazing - I've no complaints. From the first series, and what I did watch of the second series (after the massive butchering of Kahlan's personality in episode 3 and continued butchering in episode 4, I really couldn't bear to bring myself to continue), Zedd seemed to pretty consistently act just as his portrayal in the books would indicate that he should.  That brings me around to my main point, which is that Kahlan in the TV series is nothing like Kahlan in the books. In the books she is aloof (except with Richard), in control, confident, coolly calm. She does what she must do, does not make empty threats, and generally looks out for the good of others above her personal well-being (within reason). Above all, she is not driven by desires for vengeance, she does not get hissy and indignant (herpoise was a HUGE part of her personality), and the use of her power is something that she takes VERY seriously (not something that she does casually in every single fight). The Kahlan in the TV series is pretty much everything that Kahlan in the books is not and nothing that she is. Too much effort was put into making her look \\"tough\\" - yes, Kahlan is tough, but she is also kind and she derives no pleasure from being so harsh as she sometimes must be. This difference is visible in the first season but takes front seat in the second.  I guess it isn't really too surprising that they savaged the character portrayals so badly, given that, by my understanding, they didn't actually consult Terry Goodkind on the show at all after they got the rights to it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been a jogger for 13 years, 5-6 days per week, indoors & outdoors.  But when I hit 40, I swear that my metabolism slowed that very day.  I think my body became accustomed to jogging, and I became frustrated.  I tried weight machines in the gym, and found they were very boring - even more than running, which I still had to do to get cardio!  I don't have time to spend an hour & a half at the gym with work, kid, and hubby.  I am 5'-6\\" tall and weigh 130 lbs.  I know I'm not at a horrible weight, but parts of my body were shifting: my pants felt tight in the thighs, along with a little muffin top and beer belly starting.   My sis told me about 30-day Shred, I figured it was only $9, so I'd give it a try.  I am on my 30th day today!  I did Level 1 for a week, then Level 2 for 10 days, then Level 3.  You will be sore, but it's a good sore.  If you think you can't do a move one day, try again the next.  You'll be surprised how quickly you'll improve.  There were a couple exercises where I literally fell over, but my body figured out how to balance after one to two days.  I only skipped one day per week, which was usually because of traveling for work or a school function.  I even brought the DVD to my hotel room when on the road and did it in the morning!  What a great start to the day.  The only weights I had in the house were 5 lbs., which has really paid off, but everyone is different, so use what you can handle.  I see defined lines between muscles in my shoulders & arms, my rib area feels smooth instead of flabby, I lost that fatty deposit between my underarm and bra cup, and I may not have 6-pack abs like Anita, but I can see a 2-pack at least!  I swear I lost some cellulite in my outer thighs.  I only lost 2 lbs., but it doesn't matter anymore.  My clothes fit better.  I have muscle, no flabbiness, and am actually looking forward to bathing suit season.  I never understood what a solid core felt like until now.  I feel strong, instead of fragile.  I had backsurgery twice, but can handle this DVD.  In fact, now that my core is strong, my back gives me less problems.  If I had to give advice, I would say listen to what Jillian says about not taking your knee over your toe during the workouts, because that does hurt my knees.  If you can't do the workout daily, every other day would probably be just fine, but never skip two!  I skipped two days once and went back to Level 3, and felt like it was the first time.  Ouch.  I am going to start back at Level 1 now and do it all over again, because I don't want to waste all this progress.   I'll put dinner in the oven, do the Shred, then spend the rest of the evening with my family.  Or I get up just 35 minutes early when I know I can't be home to do it that night.  Try it!
0385737955|2.0|The Maze Runner is the story of 16-year-old Thomas, who arrives in a place called the Glade with no memory of his past. Thomas is just another in a series of boys who arrive once-per-month in the Glade, an area surrounded by a mysterious maze that the boys have been trying desperately to solve for two years. However, with Thomas' arrival, strange things begin happening in the Glade. The first female in a long line of boys appears and suddenly the boys in the Glade are faced with solving the maze once and for all or certain death.     Unfortunately, the characters don't come to life enough to make you care what happens either way. Thomas is the narrator, and goes through a myriad of emotions without any real depth or understanding of his feelings, as do the other characters. One minute, he's embarrassed, the next, angry, and the next, incredibly sad, without neither him nor the reader understanding why. The same goes for other characters: for a group of boys, they are certainly dramatically emotional. For instance, the narrator would say \\"He flashed me a look of anger,\\" leaving the reader to question, \\"Why is he angry?\\" This happened multiple times throughout the book, with no real explanation in the end. Teresa, who should have been compelling and fascinating, was rather flat. She was described as beautiful multiple times throughout the novel and we were constantly told that Thomas felt some deep attraction and desire to be near her. But the entire time, I just wondered why. She didn't have anything particularly interesting to contribute conversationally, nor was she a catalyst in the action. Most telling, when characters were killed, I felt little to nothing. All of them felt like cardboard cut-outs, not real people.     Another problem I saw was that the main plot device in the book was secrecy. Characters simply withheld information from Thomas for no good reason (they weren't worried about spies, they weren't trying to spare his feelings, nothing) except to keepthe reader guessing. Seriously, why were they so secretive? Heck, they wouldn't even tell him what the made-up words they were constantly using meant. And then in the end, when there should have been a Big Reveal, there wasn't. It was very anticlimactic.     (Slight spoilers) Also, the \\"solution\\" was found much too quickly. It seemed Thomas was almost a genius. One would think that a group of boys that have been working feverishly on solving the maze (their most important and coveted job) for two years may have had some leverage or knowledge over the \\"Greenie\\" when it came to solving the thing. But Thomas was constantly proving himself smarter, braver, and stronger than them in all respects. The sudden \\"epiphany,\\" along with many of Thomas's other feats just felt forced.    Overall, I give the book 2 stars because the premise was unique and original. But the lack of characterization created a disconnect between the reader and the characters that in the end, made you not even care about what happened to them.
0316286850|5.0|[[VIDEOID:d959d0e249532c6ec49cbee87ced8480]] Kevin is an absolute artist.  My dear, dear friend surprised me one day by giving me an autographed copy of this book.  He had met Kevin at a book signing in San Francisco.  To prove what an absolute wonderful person Kevin must have been he not only autographed a copy of the book but wrote something meaningful and kind.  My friend told him that it was a surprise gift and that I was feeling down in the dumps.  This is truly a prized book in my library that I will keep forever.  I am so sad that Kevin left this world way to early.  Please enjoy the video review. Sorry that it is not that focused or clear but I thought it would help to flip through the book for people to decide.
1439190275|5.0|Everyone who's dieted knows that when you're committed, losing weight isn't a problem. Self-determination can override hunger and cravings--for a time. The real problem is keeping the weight off. You can't hope for sustained weight loss if you return to the same foods that made you fat.     Whether you're an omnivore, vegetarian or vegan, the New Atkins offers a diet that is tasty, satiating, nutritious, and full of variety. It includes four phases:     Phase 1. Induction. You start by reducing carbohydrate intake to 20 grams (foundation vegetables) and increasing protein and fat. Your body will switch from burning sugar for energy to burning fat, including your own stored fat.    Phase 2. Ongoing Weight Loss. You increase your carbohydrate consumption by reintroducing specific foods (such as nuts or berries) in 5-gram increments. If weight loss stops or specific foods lead to cravings, then you adjust again by trying another new food or backing off on carbs. The goal is to identify trigger foods and increase carbs while still losing weight.    Phase 3. Pre-Maintenance. This is where you experiment with increasing your carb intake by 10-gram increments while maintaining your desired weight.     Phase 4. Lifetime Maintenance. Now you know how many carbs you can eat to maintain your desired weight for life.    The New Atkins includes information on knowing yourself; understanding carbohydrates, protein, and fat; foods to choose in ethnic restaurants and fast food establishments; and the role of water, supplements and exercise. It includes a chapter of recipes for low-carb sauces, compound butters and oils, salad dressings, marinades, rubs and broths. Another chapter includes week-long meal plans for phases 1 through 3 at various carb levels. You'll be inspired by stories of those who succeeded on the diet and coached on how to make it work for you. The book concludes with chapters on metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular health and diabetes.    And if you're like me, youmay find aches and pains vanishing over time as you avoid the gluten-containing grains wheat, rye, and barley. When I went on a low-carb diet, I had no idea that I was gluten-intolerant. I mistook decades-long back pain and stiffness for aging and a bad bed, and I learned to live with the pain. That pain is now gone.    The one thing that would make this diet not only delicious and doable but very healthy would be to eat only pasture-raised meats. These come from animals raised humanely and fed their natural dietary without the stress and drugging needed in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs). These animals taste better, have more essential omega-3 fatty acids, and are healthier for you and the environment. Please see the comments for suggestions on how to find these healthful foods.
B000001ZS4|5.0|You need to listen to it to understand it. This is the classical Jarre , when stuff was all analog.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I started running myself recently and wanted to learn more about the sport and in one of the local runner blogs stumbled upon suggestion to read this book. This book was such a page-turner.. amazing! A great story told in a very exciting and fun way throughout the book supported by different facts, supporting and opposing opinions time to time.    I even suggested this book to my friend who has nothing to do with running and I am sure he won't start running even after reading such a magnificent book. Due to the story and the way it is told, I think it is a great read for anyone.
B0045KAYH0|4.0|I ordered this compilation, as I am a new fan of Inna. I discovered her when I downloaded the free app Tune In Radio for my andriod phone, and started listening to Radio Ibiza out of Naples Italy. The downside of this package is the DVD will not play in the US on our machines as it is formatted for European players, this was a real drag as I love the videos I watch of her on You Tube. However the CD side had all the songs I wanted and although I cant play the DVD it statisfied my urge to have an Inna CD.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is like having Jillian in your livingroom. I wanted to quit but she kept telling me I couldn't! It's been 4 days and I have lost 1.1 lbs. I'm sore as heck but I keep going back for more. Highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A fantastic fantasy/sci-fi book. It's Orwellian touch is familiar yet creative, at times bringing to mind great works such as 1984 and V For Vendetta. If you appreciate dystopian fiction, this series is not one you can afford to miss!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I had problems with several of the discs not playing properly because they were scratched. Some episodes would play perfectly, others would not. I noticed this at different parts of different episodes, throughout several discs. I has the same problem with some of the special features.     I thought that it was just me until I came online and saw that other people had the same problem! Of course, by the time I got around to watching my set and realized this, it was too late to return.    What a waste of money!!! Do not buy this!! So ridiculous! If the discs would have played properly, it would have been amazing.
B00171LFFK|5.0|This is the most BEATIFUL AND PERFECT Album that i ever hear!!!, The CD Warner USA, is not comparable in sound... Highly Recommended!!
B004DK49DW|5.0|I'm not going to get real technical and break down every song on this new CD.  Point is, if you like Social D, you're going to like this new release.  I saw them recently at the House of Blues and they gave a great show, as expected, playing their heart and soul out for the crowd with a good mix of old and new stuff.  Their self-titled album still remains my absolute favorite, but unlike other bands that are getting older as I get older and forget who they are, Social D sticks to what works and keeps making good records.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|Reviews Of Unusual Size    Re: A couple is on honeymoon in Hawaii when they learn that a similar couple has been murdered and mutilated. And the couple they're traveling with seem to have a few too many secrets...    Outstanding: A tense thriller with a nice sense of timing. The locations are gorgeous. I was very surprised at Jovovich and Zahn's performances. They both managed to be normal, which is unusual for them.    Unacceptable: There were a few little moments, like the rocket propelled axe, but nothing too important    Summary: I'm surprised at the cool reception this flick initially got upon it's release. It's a classic who's gonna die-style thriller in a great location, with some excellent little twists and turns. A fun movie.    4/5      Notes: Directed by the same guy that did Pitch Black, another movie that was underappreciated on release.
B004BUUL04|2.0|I first heard this album on NPR, and I should have expected this kind of performance, given NPR's generally poor taste in music..    Look, this music is loud and dissonant,  maybe more punk rock than anything else, not to mention that the lyrics are often  difficult to decipher.  And the accompaniment is also loud and dissonant (and not \\"good\\" dissonant).    There is no way in the world that I would recommend this CD, to anyone...sorry...  The only reason I give it even two stars, is because one or two of the cuts has some, limited potential.
B00006FDCD|3.0|Reviews Of Unusual Size!    Re: Seven tormented friends stumble across a much deeper problem than bullies - a dark evil living beneath the town of Derry, ME that has been killing men and children for centuries.      Outstanding: Considering the fact that this is a TV movie from 1990, the scares and effects in it are quite effective. The cast, especially the kids are great. It's fun to see where the kids are now. Though I didn't picture Pennywise looking quite like he does, Tim Curry is spectacular as the evil clown.     Unacceptable: Despite their best efforts, the effects show their age, especially the big climax, which deviates from the story quite a bit. The movie loses a lot of the elaborate stories and creatures from the novel.     Summary: Long, creepily effective TV movie with some good performances. I wished they'd kept the more traditional clown outfit from the story, and the adaptation took some unusual turns. My wife and I thought we'd like it a lot less than we did, but we found ourselves quite enjoying the 3 hour film.     3/5     Notes: There have been rumors about a new, major motion picture swirling around. I have a really hard time seeing how they could condense this into a theatrical release, but it'd be fun to see some better beasties.
