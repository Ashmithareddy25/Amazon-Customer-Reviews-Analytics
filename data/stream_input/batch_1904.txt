B009NOVCTM|5.0|Gift for my daughter.  She loves the Stones, as I do.  Thought she better have the latest CD to enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book, read it in one day, unputdownable. Read it twice. I will highly recommend it to everyone I know. Just as I did with \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of retreat\\". Can't wait for Colleen Hoover's next book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very exciting up to the very end. I'm buying the third book right now. I could not put book down
B009GEFXLC|5.0|We recently just discoverd the Castle series, I knows only 5 seasons too later...we recently moved and it was very cool to be able to keep up with the season online.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|Can't go wrong with the Stones.  Good CD to drive with, we travel between two homes and this get's you going.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Part of my Christmas/holiday tradition every year is to watch this movie. The only cable channel it was televised on this year is a channel I do not subscribe to....so I had to purchase the DVD. I already watched the movie to make my holiday traditions complete!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another great book,  makes me a bit sad that the trilogy is done.<br />I'm glad these books were suggested to me.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|This movie actually got me interested in sharks more than discourage me from the ocean. The acting was phenomenal and the &#34;Bruce&#34; was a BIG Shark!! And you'd definitely need a bigger Boat!!
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|Awesome album! This is my son's favorite group and he loves this album. He will be wanting to buy their new one when it comes out.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is a really good game I would love to see some one in my family actually playing the game. So if some one says do not play it play it.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I enjoyed the music in the movie. It had some funny moments. The story was very light. I prefer a movie to be a little more deep.
B005EPFEPM|3.0|We ordered the hd version specifically, but there were parts that were almost unwatchable. The film itself was very good. Great documentary.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I just got it. Saw some of it in the movie theater...I am looking forward to seeing what I missed. I have the other movies in the Twilight series and love them.
B00A8Z6KN8|3.0|If you have seen the movie you know what you are getting, If you haven't I do not understand why you are reading this.
B0088O11NU|1.0|My real rating is zero stars. DO NOT LOAD THIS APP!!<br /><br />This app is a spamming machine. DO NOT LOAD this app on anything. It will add apps, notifications, alerts and other stuff on what ever you downloads to.<br /><br />DO NOT LOAD THIS APP!!<br /><br />Spam alert!!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got the free version of this app and it was kinda ho-hum. Fortunately, this was the free app of the day. A few good apps were thrown in here and there (angry birds), but this one takes the cake. Happy new year, everyone! I knew we were going to live!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once again Colleen Hoover makes me fall in love with another one of her books. First it was Slammed, then Point of Retreat and now I can add Hopeless to the list. Hopeless was an emotional ride with suspense and \\"Oh my God, no\\" that I loved going thru every last bit of that. It is such a real story with so much love, understanding, and coping the characters went thru, and handled. I would recommend it to any and everyone to read. I'm absolutely hopelessly in love with this book!!!!!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I thought that Sweet Tooth was an intriguing read. The year is 1972. It's the end of the cold war. Serena Frome, a young beautiful math student at Cambridge has an affair with an older faculty member who recruits her for MI5 and then vanishes. She is left with all kinds of questions.<br /><br />The story is told by the protagonist forty years later. And this is really interesting because it seems that many other popular authors are taking this retrospective route. Both Julian Barnes in 'The Sense of an Ending' and John Banville in 'Autumn Light' also tell their stories through the distance of forty years. In both of these novels as in Sweet Tooth the protagonists find the truth to be much different from what they perceived it to be in their youth. This retrospective storytelling by an unreliable storyteller seems to be very popular.<br /><br />As a fellow author I appreciate the craft in these novels. But I would like to see something a bit different in their future works.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]

B0043KK4N6|5.0|If you love the movie, you'll love this cd! its awesome! all the best songs from the movie, a definite must-have.
0060527986|4.0|This book was an awesome follow-up to The Alchemist. I enjoyed reading it and thought it brought an interesting perspective to the lessons presented in The Alchemist.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Interesting point of view of what happens around male strippers.  Interesting takes and it is all business.  Not so much the actual action, but the business of a job like this.
B0087YZBMS|5.0|Great album, I highly recommend this album. If you like the Corrs or Adele you have to love Amy MacDonald.
1451695195|5.0|Though short, a substantial, thought-provoking book. To be brief and to the point; what's not to like about unconditional, eternal love?
0061122416|5.0|This book presents a clear vision of the way some of us choose to live. It holds keys to maintaing strength and balance in the whirlwind of our lives.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Loved the play and love the movie. I have watched many many times overnever gets old! Movie arrived in great shape and timely!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|You can't go wrong with a classic my children ages 2,9& 10 all love this movie.Great addition to any family game night :)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|From beginning to end, this film was a pleasure for both my kiddos, wife, and myself. It was wonderfully entertaining with great voice talents. Excellent family film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I saw it when I first got my Kindle but did'nt get it cause I don't think I care much for games.  Visited the grandkids over Christmas. They had gotten a new Kindle Fire and introduced me the Angry Birds.  I'm having such a good time with it.  I'm so glad the kids showed it to me.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Read the book so wanted to watch movie it arrived in great order and played great. I Loved watching it!!
0440217563|5.0|Love this series...second time I've read them, and now have read the 5th, 6th and 7th...clearly there will be an 8th since the author ONCE AGAIN (HATE IT that she does this) left a series of cliffhangers.
1423140605|5.0|This seller got it to me SUPER FAST and I'm happy with my purchase.  I bought this book used, but it's brand spankin' new.  You'd never know someone read it before me.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|In all hosesty I haven't used it very much, but you know what they say about 1'st impressions.  After you download the program itself, you then have to download each induvidial state.  This was very time consuming and I only downloaded one state.  I can onlly imagine the time and space it might take to do all the states or even a few.  If you voom in a number of times it does get to the details of small roads, but you have to get the pay version for anything past this.  I could probably enjoy the app if it wasn't for all the downloading you would have to continue doing.  If I'm in a given place and want to see the lay of the roads so to speak, I will probably download that location and give it a try.  I'm not gonna get rid of the app but I doubt I'll use it very much either.  To use the mapping software for traveling I would not recomend at all, but to study a local area it would maybe be ok.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It was funny and actually had a decent plot. Definitely worth watching if you're looking to kill time or if you're a fan of Family Guy.
044022425X|5.0|Love this series...second time I've read them, and now have read the 5th, 6th and 7th...clearly there will be an 8th since the author ONCE AGAIN (HATE IT that she does this) left a series of cliffhangers.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I find more news here. Latest and more complete than reading other sites who do not update their stories as often.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was skeptical to read this book at first, but I am glad I decided to go ahead and buy it. This book is a great read with unexpected twist and turns about two young people who fall in love. Go ahead and buy the book and read as their lives unfold in front of you. One of the best books I have read this year.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|laggy display when watching video, sometimes loses connection if wifi signal drops below 5 bars, the interfaces available may be a little  iffy but it does what it says pretty darn well and i have full access to all my files on the go as long as my PC is on and this program is running. For all it's problems it is SUPER useful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It so electric and exciting I have read the first book and it is so awesome and  I have seen the first movie and I love the hunger games.
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|If you love to see Brad Pitt throwing chairs and musing about his roles purpose, then this is for you.<br />For those baseball affectionados who remember this event it is probably worth your time.<br />For those of us just looking for an entertaining movie night...I was falling  asleep and would never venture to waste my time watching this dog again.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was a fun and fast read. Can't wait to hear what happens in the next. Riordan is an engaging storyteller.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|Some 20 years (??) after the original and with all the technological and CGI advances, I was so looking forward to the update of this movie.  I really enjoyed the one with Arnold Swarzeneggar and Sharon Stone, but what a colossal disappointment. This movie was not an improvement.  In fact, it was terrible.  The plot and interactions between the characters are never really developed and the whole movie just ends up being one big chase scene between Colin and Kate (ho hum) with a couple minutes of the other actors thrown in for some variety, I guess.  If you liked the original... rent it again and don't bother with this tripe.  I can't even say the special effects were any better than the original, so what does that tell you?
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Well  i was out of wireless connection connection and was doing random stuff and found this and though wow this would help at school and it did
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Pretty good movie. Not as hilarious as I thought it would be, but I would still recommend it to others.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|All my favorite actors in one movie.  I was so hopeful the script would live up to these actors' abilities.  No such luck, but the cast still made the viewing worthwhile.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow!  I never could have predicted the outcomes in this book. Sheer edge of my seat suspense and action throughout. Can't wait to read book 3.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. It's challenging and fun. It's an entertaining game and keeps me entertained for hours on end.
B004132I4S|1.0|I'm amused that people are giving this album such high reviews. I love Sufjan Stevens, so I was surprised when I received this for Christmas that barely two tracks on this album could be called \\"music.\\" Music inspires, entertains, or at least makes us think of something in a new light. This album made me want to club baby seals or punch holes in my walls, both of which my parents would hardly appreciate.<br /><br />I would find it hard to imagine the people who sit around listening to this cacophonous collection of sounds (which could be found in your average back alley or college dorm past midnight), but if I were forced to, I suppose I would imagine them in communes or a hippy farm in Oregon (because hey...with drugs this album might sound a whole lot better). I can understand Sufjan recording these tracks and saving them on his own computer as some sort of momento of the past, but distributing them to the public...no...just no. If you're looking to buy a gift for a Sufjan-loving relative, save your ten bucks and don't make the same mistake my brother did.
B005LAIGLE|3.0|Given the cast I was looking forward to a good shoot-em-up, but it was just okay.  Much ado about nothing in the end.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm thru the first book and part way into the second. It's not exactly what I thought but I am enjoying the book. Friends of mine call books like this either 'romance novels' or 'lady porn' and one friend called it 'mommy porn'. I think it might be a good book for people who have some interest in BDSM as a beginning concept, though it isn't 'the encyclopedia' of D/s. It's a good read for me casual, relaxing, non-mindnumbing. Such as research read and work related items. It was recommended to my Mr. 41 :) who also read it thru Kindle.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Minor bugs keep it from a perfect score. But a fun hack n' slash romp. I didn't expect such a great experience from a free app. You have to really grind if you don't want to pay for extras. But the game's so fun it's no big deal. Buying extras, however, is cheap and tempting.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|This movie wasn't what I thought it was going to be! It totally surprised me. It exceeded my expectations and I'm looking forward to the sequel. I did try to read the book and it just didn't grab me right away.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|The whole purpose of the movie was action, shooting and gore and the movie did a pretty good job of making those characteristics watchable.
B000UEV18Q|5.0|I have been preparing to divest most of my personal books, in favor of PDF or Kindle, but decided to hang on to the leather-bound volumes, which are generally more legible than the trade publications. Surfing about amazon, I located three titles that I actually wanted to upgrade to leather-bound, and DUNE was one of them, along with THE VIRGINIAN and the Tolkien set from Easton Press. It is great to have readable copies now of these, some of my favorite titles. I love having the PDF files of many works on my hard-drive for quick consultation, but there will never be a substitute for a really fine volume like this in one's hands. It is a drug, bending space and time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book seems to be very  polarizing. You either LOVE it or really hate it.  I was given this by a friend who stopped reading it after 3 chapters because he found it way too boring. I, on the other hand, was immediately captured by the wonderful words and descriptions that just sucked me into this world.  Let me just say, that my favorite Stephen King books are not his horror, but all the stories from Different Seasons which includes Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, Apt Pupil, The Body and The Breathing Method.<br /><br />11/22/63 isn't horror, but a fantastic story about Jake traveling back in time. He is enraptured by the smells and tastes of the late 50's (everyone smokes, the EPA wasn't in existence, and the food was full of flavor. When he described his first taste of 1950's root beer I knew I would love this book!)  I had no idea where this book was taking me - ok, I knew it had something to do with the Kennedy Assassination - But I didn't really care how or where the rest of the story went. It was just wonderful experience being taken along on this ride.  Yes, this book is long, but when it came to the end, I was very sad to leave Jake and Sadie and was wanting so much more.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I watch this movie at least two times a year. Especially on Halloween, I have been known to watch it on Christmas just because I am a freaky fan like that..
B003UESJFQ|5.0|Bob Hoskins' and Sally Hawkins' performances made this so worthwhile.  This kind of story will never lose its luster for me.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Typical Clancy..multiple story line plots..lot of techno garble...inside knowledge of military  procedures/options ...all combined to make for a good thriller.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I REALLY love this app because it's an eclectic mix of varying degrees of time killing mini games. It's fun that you have to unlock the rest of the games and gives you something easy and fun to work towards.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I think the title says it all. This movie was fun, worth watching, but very predictable. It did get me wondering whether kids in college actually compete in acapella style singing like in the movie. It seems like fun.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I bought this back in multi-cassette VHS format when it was new.  I still think it is the best Jane Austen around.  And the young Colin Firth is stunning.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I first heard about this book while watching an episode of Friends. The minute I started reading it, I fell completely in love with the characters. It was a very heart-warming story that I would definitely read again.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|so worth 3bucks I play this for hours I saw it on my friends ipod and I wanted to get it on my kindle fire now I can:) toca hair salon 2 is a good game it is fun for boys and girls you should get it.peace out going to go play toca hair salon!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book has prompted me to re-think what Happines is and how to re-program my thinking to see the world around me.
1603427244|4.0|I plan on using this book for many years as my &#34;bible:&#34; for binding on and casting off. Good compilation.
B001HN6918|5.0|We thought the first one was excellent but this one is just as good if not funnier. It looks like they are leaving room for a 3 as well. Great for kids and adults too.
B0086700CM|5.0|so much fun I am so glad it was free cool and fun peace out from monsterhighlover121 I would buy it if it wasn't free:)!
B005H0IW6W|3.0|Somewhat dissappointing. Has Michael lost a little something since he was married?? Some song selections a little to modern. Would like the sounds of the past for Christmas.
0790729393|1.0|Half way through the movie it stopped. You have to turn the disc over AND miss content in order to watch the rest of the movie. VERY disappointed with this. Ruined an otherwise great movie. Would not recommend it to anyone. Does not meet expectations.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Remember when you first read Lord of the Rings and nearly gave up after 100 pages because they still hadn't left the Shire?  That's sort of how you'll feel throughout this book.<br /><br />I can't say anything negative about Rothfuss' ability to create vivid realistic characters living in an engrossing fantasy universe.  And for the first 300 pages or so, the book was a true page turner.  But once Kovthe entered Hogworts--sorry, the University, the plot flow slowed to molasses.  Do we really need to read 4 (or 6? I lost count.) separate episodes of how Kvothe and Draco--sorry, Ambrose--try to get each other into trouble in school?  After 700 pages of what supposedly is an auto-biography, should the main character really still not have reached age 15?<br /><br />There's enough good in the book for me to bother trying out the sequel.  It could be all this background info is absolutely necessary to create a compelling and all-engrossing series.  But I'm not holding my breath.
1608871452|5.0|This is a great product.  I am a huge fan of Supernatural and this is exactly what I was looking for when I saw this.  The seller provided an accurate description of the product and was quick to getting it to me.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent combo<br />The version in Blu-ray is great.<br />Have a lot of additional material.<br /><br />Cheap, good HD, great sound.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Really enjoyed the first of the series.  Will  look for more of the Jack Reacher books.  Headed out to see the movie.
B004Q0SQ24|4.0|vERY WELL MADE PRODUCT.  aLL OF cHUGGINGTON PRODUCTS ARE WELL MADE.  tHEY ARE GREAT FOR LITTLE BOYS TO PLAY WITH
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|First the disclaimer, I'm not an expert.<br /><br />This is a beatiful adaptation, it should though as the original author of the great musical was involved. I haven't seen the muscial in Broadway but had seen other adaptations. This one is my favorite so far. The fact that it is a blue-ray also helps.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like this app but after a few months it gets tiring and you never play it.......the sound effects don't work after a while so the longer you have the app the cheaper it gets. its the same old thing. its good but not great would not download.
1611761182|5.0|This actor reading this book is great! The accents are believable and the reader's voice is clear and understandable. The story line moves along well and there is not a great deal of review all the time. This makes the work more interesting thatn other series where the review is so complete that it becomes annoying. I definately recommend this!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm only in the first book, but I am totally obsessed!  There is something to be said for the fact that the book is so well written, that much of the dialog in the show is taken verbatim. No need to dress it up or dumb it down.<br />For the show fans, I would definitely recommend the books, because there is so much going on in the characters lives and history that get's left unsaid on the show, that it really paints a clearer picture of the people we have grown to love and/or hate.<br />So far, love it!
B000EQHHJW|4.0|First the disclaimer, I'm not expert.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it, the music is great and the acting and singing of the masters is always good (unless you are a real critic sensitive to nuances imperceptible for us mortals) The four stars is because I belive it could have looked better.  Dont leave the following discourage you from buyint, it is still worth it, Im just explaining why I didint give the 5 stars. The transfer to digital could be better. Maybe it was done at a time when TV screens were smaller and blue-ray was not a reality. Even for a DVD it could improve, this is a suggestion for new editions.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|I forgot just how funny this movie was! I haven't laughed that hard for a long time! It was the best.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Nothing amazing but it wasn't a waste of money. I wouldn't watch it again and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|One of the best movies released. Great ending to a perfect story. Keeps your attention from the beginning to end
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|great game! especially for little kids! great for just passing time. I'd. recommend this game to anyone!!!! its fun building a city with lots of pets!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. It was very exciting and suspenseful. My girls enjoyed it a I read it to them.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I got 2 of these and I am using one to hold my Macbook Pro above my desktop and the other we use it by attaching it to the coffee table in the living room and using it to hold the ipad.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|fun to watch & funny. yes it is for adults so there is adult language & context. that's what makes it funnier, about a grown man and his hilarious teddy bear. not meant to be taken serious and be analyzed. just a silly movie to enjoy watching for a few good laughs.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|With this App you can find and view downloaded documents and organize your files into folders. It also helps when you to sideload Android apps from sites besides the Amazon Appstore.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book because it kind of wraps up the other books written before it. It was also pretty funny!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I liked this movie!  It kept my attention better than I though it would.  Well acted and good action scenes.  I feel like some of the script could have been fleshed out bit more but overall good entertainment!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I bought this book for my \\"original\\" new year's resolution of being in better shape. I've really liked this book because its concise, easy to read, based on experience and science and covers all the topics necessary to be fit such as nutrition, supplements and of course, exercise.<br /><br />The best advice in comparison to just going to a gym and receive advice from your \\"instructor\\" is that he tells you the right way, based on studies, on how to achieve maximum results in less time.<br /><br />Finally the author is very \\"social\\" and you can easily reach him trough Facebook, Twitter or even old fashioned email for a quick tip or recommendation. That's most of what you get at your traditional gym.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is the best free app to allow printing documents from a Kindle Fire. It currently does not support printing webpages but you can email a link to a webpage and print it with a PC.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Like this book and will be reading number 3! I like it better than 50 Shades of Grey by far.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a great story about the fate of orphans in Ireland. It had me laughing out loud on one page and tearing up the next. But the endin is....I won't spoil it for you. Happy or sad? Read it to find out.

1439152802|4.0|I'll keep my review short and sweet: I really did love this book. The storyline of it kept me guessing until the very end, yet was totally *believable* as much as it was intriguing. I love the back-and-forth storytelling, the ways in which the past influences the present and future, and the strength of the characters no matter their back story. The characters were fun to know and for the one strong heroine there was another who was just crazy enough to have you shaking your head and pressing on.<br /><br />I did take away a star due to some minor problems I had with the book. For one thing, I would have loved to know more about Vivien and Jimmy's story together. I also had trouble with the writing style with this one (and I've read all of Morton's other books). Some parts left me confused so that I had to read the passage over again to grasp her meaning - sometimes she threw in words that no one truly uses and that caught me a bit off guard as they seemed out of place. She had the habit of \\"dropping off\\" a topic abruptly, so that when I turned a page I had to double check that I hadn't skipped a page on accident. Also, and this was probably the most frustrating, I had to continue skipping back to remember exactly what she'd said before. As I said, I love the flashbacks to the past, but often in this book it led to Laurel saying or knowing things that I was just positive had only been mentioned in a flashback she wasn't privy too, which forced me to scour past conversations and her detective work to see if she really had learned that on her own (eventually I just gave up and trusted Morton knew what she was doing).<br /><br />Anyway - despite my \\"negative\\" paragraph being larger than my \\"positive\\" one, I really did love this book. I devoured it in about three long sittings and while I guessed certain parts, I was ultimately surprised at the end. It had an ending that felt very justified and even happy and I would absolutely recommend this book to others.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was an amazing book/story/picture book.<br />At first from the description of the story that said that it was filled with pictures, I believed that this book would be mostly full of pictures; that was not the case.<br /><br />In this story, a boy named Jacob was told a story from his grandfather when he was young. The story was that on an island somewhere, a group of children lived. These children were orphans. Each of them possessed a special ability. And to proved this, Jacobs fathers showed him the picture of the children with their talents in action. Each of these pictures were amazing; most of them in black and white. Just to give you a hint as to how they look, the cover of the book is one of the pictures.<br /><br />I have a kindle fire, and had no trouble view the photos. Only because if you would like to get a closer look at the photos, you can zoom.<br />I felt that the whole plot of the story is set st a perfect pace, except for when *SPOILER*Jacob takes a trip to the island to find out if his grandfathers stories are true.**<br /><br />The photos in the story really help you picture the place that Jacobs grandfather explained. A paradise for children.<br /><br />Thus book sets on a magical feel, and also had me laughing from the witty comments. It also had twist that I believe no one could have expected_- like I couldn't. Though I am one to try to figure out the ending to a story.<br />If you have a thing for stories with adventure, and a great sense of humor: no matter the situation, this is just for you. This book was absolutely sad at sometimes, but did not stop me from reading.<br /><br />A book for all ages, and certainly an entertaining read!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an amazing book, I would have never expected what happened in the end! This book rocks so much!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. I love how Ana wasn't afraid to stand for what she felt in the end. I didn't enjoy her being his sex slave though!! I would refer this book to all friends and family!! I chose 5 star rating because  the story itself was breath taking and left me wanting for more. That's what readers enjoy so that's what great authors give!!!
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Can't get enough of this game. Playing the harder mode is a challenge that keeps me coming back for more. It's good for young players too. They have to use strategy to complete the levels. One complaint is it quits automatically once in a while and we have to start the game over but not from the beginning might have to delete from Kindle and reinstall to fix this annoying problem. This was $1 well spent for hours of entertainment.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have read most of Lee Child's books.  I am not a writer, and will not try to tell you about the book, or complain about the movie (which I will not be going to see.) I don't understand why people are even bringing it up as part of the review.<br /><br />I will tell you that the story in this Reacher novel is a delightfull change on Lee's part. It kept me wanting to turn the pages, and ended as I would expect a Reacher novel to end.<br /><br />It is still a classic Reacher story, with all the mystery, and violence you would expect, just laid out in a new setting.<br /><br />If you like Reacher, then buy this book.

B009G8GRX6|5.0|I own almost all of Muse's music. This is by far (in my humble opinion) their greatest album.<br /><br />I love Muse and I'd recommend any of their albums, but this one is my favorite. If you are a Muse fan, gotta check this out. If you are not a Muse fan, this album may be a turning point for you. Supremacy, Madness, Survival, Follow Me, and Animals are some highlights. Panic Station and Big Freeze are very goo as well.<br /><br />This is my first review. Thanks for taking 15 seconds out of your day to read it. :}
B008LV8TSU|5.0|A couple of years back, I stumbled across a movie - Howl's Moving Castle, directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I absolutely loved the movie, and I soon learned it was based off of a book. I didn't have much motive to find a copy at the time, but it was just yesterday when I purchased the book.<br /><br />I was truly impressed! Jones creates such a fantastic world in this novel, one of wizards, witches, and magic. If you enjoy Tolkien' s novels, then you will fall in love with Howl's Moving Castle.<br /><br />One of the most enjoyable things I found about this book was the characters. Every character effected the book in some way and all had such great personalities. Sophie 's antics constantly humored me, while Howl, I found, was very dashing and witty (I was afraid he would eat my heart, too!).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone, and I cannot wait to read the sequel.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Kids love this holiday favorite! Great for both parents and adults. We have fun watching this as a family. Great!

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I enjoy play this game. Not as bored as I am playing solitaire. The graphics are really great. I can play this for hours.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This edition of Mr. Nolan's Batman is just fine, story wise, but productions wise, it is a mess, especially in the audio department. I have excellent hearing and a phenomenal state of the art home system, but I shouldn't have to ride the remote volume to hear  Batman gasp his dialogue as if he had swallowed dust and sand. And whoever thought it was a good idea to have Bane speak through that ridiculous mouth plate, has no understanding of tonality. Mix that in with his accent and on goes the button for the hearing impaired. Also, if you are looking for parallel sympathies/ antipathies to ramp up the eventual collision between Batman and Bane, why not do a better job with Bane's back story? The slapdash references to him throughout the film don't create the kinds of tragic mix that should underscore this character. In fact, relative to Batman's own tortured past, what the hell is eating Bane, especially after Bane exiles him to a similar fate he had to endure? It boggles the mind. It can't be the economy.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|Not sure why so many people hate on this film so badly; have to admit I wasn't too hyped on a film based on a board game ... but I loved that game growing up, and really like a few of the cast members here, so with incredibly low expectations I started to watch.  Maybe that was why I liked it - I went in expecting just mindless entertainment, and on that score this film succeeded (at least to me).  Aliens threaten the world, the Navy steps in and gets its ass kicked, and then just before turning tail the Navy gets all pro-American and comes back kicking (ass) and screaming.  Shut your brain down, this one isn't that bad (though Rihanna kind of got on my nerves).
1572814136|5.0|I love the colors, the size and the feel of this deck.  I highly recommend this to  tarot card collectors.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Definitely got $1's worth of entertainment from it.  It is a sit and think about it puzzler, not an action game.  You do get to make changes if you set it up the wrong way and can clear all the mice.  The graphics are not updated or particularly exciting, but I play puzzlers to enjoy the puzzle, and it works fine for that.<br /><br />I see some other reviewers complaining about it not running well or crashing, but I had no problems with it.<br /><br />I'll play it now and again to kill some time, but it isn't one of those puzzles that I feel obsessed with, so it doesn't get 5 stars.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|Seems to demonstrate how far we have gotten away from our true self.  Maybe similar to Avatar movie about people connected to Mother Earth.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|Robert Redford's films always come off very dry to me; stoic, and with little to no genuinely-felt emotional content. That said, this is very good film that maybe works because of Redford's style, telling the story of the lone female accused of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright, in a nicely nuanced performance) ran the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators (including Mary's own son) plan Lincoln's (as well as other) assassination, and when her son escapes justice its almost as if the law arrests Mary in his place. She swears she had no knowledge of any of the plans discussed in her own home, and with even her court-appointed attorney (James McAvoy) unsure of what to believe, the case against Mary Surratt heads to trial as he tries to find evidence of her innocence. Not just a courtroom melodrama, the film features some fine performances, and nice suspense as McAvoy pokes around and finds evidence that comes more and more to make him believe Mary may have been set up ... though whether it will help or not, when the powers that be have already tried and convicted Mary in their heads, is a different matter.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hard book to read, but great story. Kind of overwhelming. I never felt connected, but I guess it was hard to read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Absolutely love this game. I first played it on the iPad and am very glad that it is now available for Android. It's fun, interesting, a little humorous, and difficult enough to keep me interested.<br /><br />I enjoy the strategic nature of it, and with work am able to get through all the types without having to resort to hints, meaning it is difficult but not stupidly difficult for the sake of being difficult.  Some of the trophies I have not been able to get yet, which is fine with me, it gives me goals which increase replay-ability.  I don't play it as much now as I did in the first fever pitch of the spread of the game, but I still enjoying coming back and spending some time trying to kill everyone on the planet while attempting to unlock an achievement I haven't gotten yet.<br /><br />A quality app that a lot of care went into making and I hope they are earning enough money that they can continue to make games of this quality and interest level (or keep evolving this game).
0316069434|4.0|Harry's at his best when he's on a cold case. This one is a murder some years back during the LA-Rodney King riots. A new somewhat sympathetic IA female detective is introduced, this story is also notable for Harry leaving Los Angeles and journey out into the sticks, where he may or may not end up getting in over his head.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|A film I liked MUCH better than I thought I would ... and worth seeing not because of Kristen Stewart (whose acting range is that of cardboard), but rather in spite of her.  Same story; evil queen (Charlize Theron, EXCELLENT here!) needs to off her \\"fairest one of all\\" stepdaughter Snow White, hires hunky huntsman (Chris Hemsworth, also very good here in mini-Thor mode) to do the deed and bring back the girl's heart.  Huntsman can't do the deed, they hook up with seven dwarfs (sorry, \\"little people\\"), and then Snow White goes all Terminator and gathers an army together to take back her kingdom and stop the evil queen's dark tyranny over the entire land.  Nice fight and action sequences, cinematography, and Theron's icy queen make it worth a look, for sure.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is so fun to me  because I love puzzle  games  !  They are so fun this one is the funnest.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This is one of the best books that o have ever ever read  ! I could read it over a million times and still love this book
B009O07NDY|5.0|A must have for any fan of the music from the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. Recommended to all!
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Disappointing sequel finds Watson getting married but Holmes not letting that stop him from dragging Watson into the investigation of a series of deaths and bombings that threaten to start war.  Professor Moriarty, Holmes' greatest foe, is behind it all, and while there are some pretty awesome moments in this film, overall it just feels like it's missing the humanity the first one achieved so well.  This one is more about elaborate fight scenes and action sequences and explosions, and at times Holmes here comes off almost more annoying/grating than ever in the first.  Not a bad film certainly, but just lackluster compared to its predecessor.

B000SGGUWS|4.0|I was looking for differences between the book and the show while I was reading this .There were only a few differences in detail and some events. If you love the show you would love this too!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A clear and concise book on learning to speak the language of love that your spouse needs to hear. I recommend this book for newlyweds and couples who have been married for years. It offers fresh insight into our oldest and deepest emotion.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|Three young men - cousins Andrew (who has recently taken to taking a video camera with him everywhere, chronicling everything) and Matt, and Matt's friend Steve - discover, in the woods near a party they are attending, a hole in the ground that leads them to what looks like an alien ship buried underground.  The boys get a little too close, eventually being knocked unconscious - and when they awaken the ship-thing is gone ... and the guys discover they now have telekinetic powers.  Powers that grow only stronger as they use them.  As Matt and Steve have fun with their new-found powers, testing them, Andrew (whose home life is rotten, to say the least) finds the powers appealing more to his darker side ... and soon the \\"fun\\" gets out of hand, and turns decidedly sinister as Andrew in particular pulls away from his buddies, able now to fight back against all the injustices that have piled against him over the years.  The ending \\"battle\\" is killer here (I saw the director's cut, six minutes longer and way-cool), and you grow to know and care about the three main characters and what will happen to them.  Loved it!
B009G3TNIM|5.0|Everyone knows the music is awesome. But, if you are buying the mp3 version (or the regular CD) make sure to check out the [[ASIN:B009G45M4A All We Love We Leave Behind [Deluxe Edition]]] as it has 3 extra tracks: No Light Escapes, On My Shield and Runaway.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|All my friends were talking about this book so I thought, hey why not try it? And the more I read I couldn't put it down! I know some people don't like the idea of kids killing kids...but come on people it's just a story! I'm thirteen and I found this very entertaining! Although I have to say at the end of the book where Cato dies, I think they drug the whole when's- the- cannon- gonna-go-off was a little to much. That was the only thing that bored me about this book and I can't wait to read the second and third!!!

B009JZTOG8|5.0|As a fan of &#34;Merlin,&#34; &#34;Eureka&#34; and &#34;Doctor Who,&#34; this would seem like a natural for me. But it just did not appeal for whatever reason. Then one day I decided to give it a chance and now I'm hooked. It travels between different times and places with such ease. I was lucky enough to watch this in a marathon seating and was fascinated with good writing that allowed the interlocking stories and characters to unfold and make sense. I especially admire the acting chops of Scottish actor Robert Carlyle. He's one terrific villain -- this actor has incredible range and depth.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|There is a lot to do in this. Im going to be sad when free runs out. It's an interesting story. Too bad I'm sure not to finish.
B005BHNCO8|5.0|You get a ton of stuff for a great price, and the carry bag really makes this set perfect. I don't know when I would use an umbrella flash set if I could not take it with me easily. Each umbrella has a reflective cover so you can use it in multiple ways.<br /><br />The mounting hardware isn't the highest quality, the mounting brackets are made of plastic, so If you tend to over torque screws, you may end up striping the brackets, but if you are careful tightening everything, it will last you a long time. The umbrellas and the stands, will last you a long time if you are not overly rough with them. All you need them for is to to stand up and be a source of light distribution, and they do their job just fine. I was able to take some great portraits using this set.<br /><br />Everything works great and will last, only thing to worry about is the mounting brackets for your bulbs or flash, and being careful with them. Worst case, you can buy a sturdier bracket after some time, but till then these will be sufficient.<br /><br />I think overall, price, bag, quality, and items included I give this set 5 stars.
B009HELT3C|3.0|The main reason to watch MIB III is for Josh Brolin's superb impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones!  I might even give him the nod over Karl Urban's great read as Leonard McCoy in the Star Trek reboot!  (Is this a trend in hollywood?)  The movie starts boringly.  I don't mean slow, as there is a lot of action but it didn't generate a lot of excitement or anticipation.  The dialogue was poorly written for the most part.  Tommy Lee unfortunately comes across as just grumpy, and even though the movie provides an explanation in the end it could have been handled much better.  The middle of the movie with Will Smith and Josh Brolin was worth the effort of the first few minutes though!  The new interplay and peer interaction was very well done.  I'd like to see some way to bring Josh back in a next version ...  K could have an accident which de-ages him, which would be the Aliens' worst nightmare and the fans' (and series') dream come true for a &#34;reboot&#34; of sorts!<br />If you liked the first 2, watch this one.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I like the LastPass password manager. Have it on my desktop also. Passwords are shared across the platforms. The manager for Android works differently than for the desktop and takes a bit of practice to get used to. On the Android you have to open the PW manager, find the site you are going to, and click it; it then takes you to the site and logs you in. Works great!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|After Peter Jackson's multi-oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, skepticism was voiced about how he might expand Tolkien's earlier and slimmer 1937-published prequel into three full-length films, and the original idea was a 2-part `Hobbit'. If the first installment is indicative of the overall standard of the forthcoming trilogy, we needn't worry: the Kiwi with the golden touch has pulled it off again.<br /><br />Tolkien's dwarves are a grudge-bearing, avaricious but tirelessly industrious race who create great underground kingdoms to mine Middle Earth's riches, with a history of cool relations with other races (especially the elves) but ultimately `good guys'. `The Hobbit' concerns the adventures of Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's bachelor-uncle and a reluctant participant in a quest with 13 dwarves led by the redoubtable Thorin Oakenshield (played here by a brooding and rage-driven Richard Armitage) to recover their distant `Kingdom under the Mountain' for several years occupied by the fire-breathing dragon Smaug.<br /><br />In similar style to the `Fellowship of the Ring' Jackson's new epic opens by offering the audience a brief dramatized history lesson of the dragon's assault on the Kingdom under the Mountain & what became of the dwarves after their exile. Then we pan to the quiet pastoral life of Bilbo Baggins in his hobbit hole, some 60 years before handing over `the ring' to nephew Frodo, and the arrival of the 13 uninvited dwarves who proceed to eat him out of house & home. The superb Ian McKellen (in a role he was surely born to play) once again presides as Gandalf, who has convinced the dwarves that they need Bilbo as a burglar to succeed on their mission because the dragon can smell dwarves a mile away but doesn't know the smell of hobbits.<br /><br />Martin Freeman is an unexpectedly excellent Bilbo, a more complex and less instantly-likeable character than Elijah Wood's shining & heroic Frodo. Other characters from Jackson's LotR trilogy appear briefly to tie this prequel in to the later epic: Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) & Saruman (Christopher Lee) reprise their roles in a mini-replay of the council at Elrond's house; a scene recorded in Tolkien's historical notes but not in the original published `The Hobbit' and inserted here to offer the audience link to the follow-up LotR in describing the revival of Sauron.<br /><br />The seamless integration of up-to-the-minute CGI with live actors is again a big feature, endowing the action with often breath-taking realism. The scene with three mountain trolls (played as dwarf-roasting gourmets with cockney accents!) straight from Tolkien's original text is a fine example; the giant figures mix-in seamlessly with the small, creating a real-imaginary world of astonishing detail. The villains of the piece are the dwarf-hating, warg-riding orcs, a personal vendetta between orc-chief Azog (played to perfection by a malice-oozing Manu Bennett) & Thorin realized in grisly detail and justifying the film's not-for-unaccompanied-children rating. Andy Serkis reprises his starring role from LotR with a masterful performance as the CGI-enhanced Gollum in Tolkien's `riddles in the dark' chapter. This is the film's key scene, dramatic tension revealing the pathos & complexity of the character as the `one ring' chooses its new bearer and firmly ties the narrative in to the LotR trilogy.<br /><br />Peter Jackson is revealed once again as the undisputed master of bringing Tolkien to the big screen. A more linear tale than the multiply sub-plotted LotR and with fewer characters, Jackson's adapted screenplay for `The Hobbit' remains faithful to Tolkien's original tale and offers us a great cinematic experience. The script is intelligent, the continuity & pacing superb, the action sequences edge-of-seat gripping - though there might be a bit too much frantic chase-movie screen time & too many cliff-hangers for some viewers. The panoramic NZ South-Island locations are sumptuous, with distance shots of tiny figures in huge natural landscapes & soaring snow-clad mountains complete with cascading waterfalls. There is light & shade, even humor to a level of slapstick worthy of circus-clowns in the precipitous underground goblin-kingdom scenes dominated by a brilliant performance from the heavily-disguised Barry Humphries.<br /><br />The DVD release is region-free. The 3D adds a lot to the experience, and can be recommended unreservedly.<br /><br />It looks like Jackson and his team have raised the bar again and might have another cinematic triumph on their hands.s, with distance shots of tiny figures in huge natural landscapes & soaring snow-clad mountains complete with cascading waterfalls.

B0094KTC6K|5.0|I first saw the preview for this before watching another movie... when I saw the release date, I sighed... and new I had missed the chance to see it in theaters.  I had heard nothing about this one before.  I checked out Am. Prime, and found it...

B00A4W3AJC|5.0|If there is still such a thing as the \\"tortured artist\\" in this day and age, Leos Carax is definitely it. Hailed as a genius with his first films in the Eighties \\"Boy Meets Girl\\" and \\"Mauvais Sang\\", and boasting the up and coming Juliette Binoche as a girlfriend, Mr. Carax seemed poised for an extraordinary career and a place in the Pantheon of the great filmmakers. However, all came to a crashing halt with the release of \\"Les Amants du Pont Neuf\\", his masterpiece, in 1991.<br />If you watch that film today it's impossible to think of it as anything other than a classic, but at that time the movie was the most expensive French film ever made, caused the bankruptcy of three producers, and was a critical bomb in France. An enthusiastic reception in the US might have changed the course of history, but as it happens, the film got a negative review by then New York Times critic, Janet Maslin, and you know what a bad NYT review can do for an art film. This does not mean that the film did not have fans, as it topped Film Comment's list of the Greatest Unreleased Films of the Nineties.<br />Carax and his career crashed and burned (including his relationship with Binoche) and he didn't make another film until 1999, \\"Pola X\\", which received a lukewarm reception.<br />And now 20 years after \\"Les Amants du Pont Neuf\\", and 13 years after \\"Pola X\\", Leos Carax has made a triumphant return with \\"Holy Motors\\", acclaimed at Cannes, getting awards in France, and being hailed as one of the year's best films by many of the major critics in the US.<br />This introduction is for those unfamiliar with Carax and who might not understand what all the fuzz is about, especially because as brilliant as \\"Holy Motors\\" is, it might not be the most immediately accesible of his works; if there is such a thing, it would be \\"Les Amants du Pont Neuf\\", but this is not an arthouse film for the \\"Downtown Abbey\\" crowd.<br />\\"Holy Motors\\" is a deliriously, joyous, operatic odissey through Paris, through cinema, and through the contemporary world. A mysterious man (Dennis Lavant, a Carax regular since his first film) rides around Paris in a limousine, as he assumes different identities, which include a homeless lady, a corporate raider, a working class dad, and a crazy elf. The film is constructed as a series of gorgeous set pieces which participate of different worlds and different movie genres: fantasy, science fiction, crime movies, contemporary realism. In this sense \\"Holy Motors\\" is poetic rather than narrative cinema, so don't expect an easy explanation or resolution.<br />This does not mean the film lacks suspense, on the contrary, it's a consistently dazzling and surprising experience, as M. Oscar goes about the world changing identities and doing everything, from engaging in a form of virtual sex in some futuristic games, to (as an Elf) kidnapping a silent Eva Mendes and taking her to an underground hideout in a Beauty and the Beast homage. There is also an extraordinary interlude featuring Kylie Minogue (yes, Kylie Minogue) which showcases the movie's and Carax's mad romanticism.<br />In this sense, \\"Holy Motors\\" is to be first experienced rather than understood, it's an spectacle, and at some points it has the feeling of a carnival. The director is putting on a show for the audience, as his main character is doing when assuming all these different identities and that gives the movie a Carnivalesque feeling, as we move through different worlds and characters: sublime, grotesque, disturbing, romantic. And you can feel the Director as the Orchestra Conductor, and in this sense, the film calls to mind, among many other films, Federico Fellini's 8 1/2, but with a much darker and maybe metaphysical understreak.<br />But let's the director end this review with his own words:<br />\\"In this world I invented, it's a way of telling the experience of a life without using a classical narrative, without using flashbacks. It's trying to have the whole range of human experience in a day\\" said in an interview with Indiewire.And then to Aintitcoolnews: \\"I really think of it as a film about the experience of being alive nowadays, alive in this world\\"ence in a day\\" said in an interview with Indiewire.And then to Aintitcoolnews: \\"I really think of it as a film about the experience of being alive nowadays, alive in this world\\"

0316227706|5.0|I bought this book as a gift to my office.  We're a medical practice and had the WORST waiting room books.  I put Underwater Dogs in the waiting room about a month ago and I hear comments from patients all the time about how cute it is!  I had one patient buy several copies after she saw ours.  You will not be disappointed by these photographs...truly amazing!

0345536886|5.0|Highly paid young lawyer David Zinc walks away from his big salary job with a huge Chicago law firm and bounces from a drunken binge into Finley & Figg -- a bottom feeding, ambulance chasing law firm on the Chicago south side.  Zinc has never argued a case in court, but possesses enough integrity and common sense to begin to rescue the bumbling firm from its own comical ineptitude and blunders.  As with Grisham's earlier novel, The Rainmaker, this young lawyer finds a legitimate and worthy cause in representing some victims of corporate negligence on a contingency basis while making a tidy sum in legal fees when the settlement is reached.  In David Zinc, legal profession does appear to have an example of skill and zealous representation of the powerless, albeit after traveling on a journey into territory where much of the arrogance, immorality and utter stupidity that inspire so many lawyer jokes are on full display.  This is one Grisham novel that is less exciting than amusing, and ultimately uplifting. It is a page-turner and enjoyable read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would like to have been able to do this entire review, ALL in shouty capitals... but that would only make it hard to read and therefore I'm not going to do it. I'm going to stick to one sentence... the only sentence in this entire review that you should read and take note of.<br /><br />HOPELESS BY COLLEEN HOOVER IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST AMAZING BOOK I'VE READ ALL YEAR AND QUITE... POSSIBLY EVER READ!!!<br /><br />There, I've shouted and I'll calm down now so that I don't scare you. I'm hypnotized by the brilliance of this book. Like I said I don't think I've ever read a book, that has made me become so attached to it. Of course there are many books out there that I simply adore... but what makes this book so unique and the reason I'm giving it my very first gold award (as well at the reason I decided to start giving yearly awards) is because... every single second of the book, brings out every emotion you have to offer.<br /><br />It's so real... it's tragic and romantic. Forgiving as well as unforgiving. It's a masterpiece of words. If it were a movie, it would win an Oscar. If it were a song, without a second guess, it would be awarded a Grammy.<br /><br />\\"I live you, Sky,\\" he says against my lips. \\"I live you so much.\\"<br /><br />There is not a single thing in this book that I didn't love. Even the drama... it was a lot of drama... but it was freaking addicting drama. The romance was passionate and raw. The relationships so deep... every single one... even the side-kick relationships drew you in. Nothing... I repeat... Nothing in this book was a let down or irritating.<br />I loved Holder, I loved Sky, I adored their relationship and the intimate moments they share. I loved their strength as a couple and the ability to always stand beside each other, even at the most darkest of times.<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't read it....... why haven't you read it? If you have no intention of reading it, you will be making the biggest mistake of your life. Once you have read Hopeless, nothing will ever be the same for you. I finished this book, looking at life in a new light. I will no longer be swayed by second best, when I can have this... this brilliant writing, this amazing plot or this exceptional tale. Thank You Colleen Hoover, you've totally made my year!<br /><br />Read More Reviews On My Blog<br />Coffee, Books & Lipglossthe way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't read it....... why haven't you read it?

B006VJMZXY|5.0|As always, Philippa Gregory employs her excellent narrative skills to bring historical facts, people and ongoing scholarly debates to life. I enjoyed the book very much.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|You can't go wrong with Nicholas Sparks!  It was a page turner and a book that I could not put down.  He really made the characters come alive!  Loved it!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't rave about ths book enough! The characters are so deep, and real, that you fall in love with them. The writing spot on, and the story has so much depth, and flow. Its an utterly heart wrenching, chill bump inducing story, that you won't regret reading.  Giving this 5 stars!
0865479410|5.0|I've always been the one sitting in the back row complaining about all the positive thinking seminars my employers have sent me that don't work and this book explains why they will never work. The simple parlor game of trying not to think about a white polar bear for 1 minute is the crux of the matter. The way our brain is wired the more we attempt to not think about something the more we think about. The idea is if you can only have positive thoughts you must spend all your time analyzing your thoughts to see if they are positive.<br /><br />Maybe the stoics were right after all and we have spent centuries ignoring their teachings.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is a fun game to pass time. My litter sister love it because of prizes and fun noise! I love it to.
B00571F26Y|5.0|If you are interested in losing weight, feeling better  and leading a healthier life, then this is the book to get.  I first heard of Dr. Davis' book from a co-worker at my former employer's Xmas party this December, 2012.  Although I do not have celiac disease (my co-worker does) he recommended this book to me.  Dr. Davis' thesis is that abdominal fat (wheat belly) is due to consumption of wheat products, gluten, carbohydrates and can spike your blood sugar.  After my co-worker suggested this book, I went home and the next day I ordered the e-book for download to my PC and copied the file to my Kindle.  I am a 61-year-old male, weighed close to 200 lbs and am about 5 foot 8 inches tall. I take 3 blood pressure pills and an anti-cholesterol pill.  My last bloodwork results showed a fasting blood sugar of 107 -- not yet diabetic but high enough to cause me some concern.  So I read Dr. Davis' book with much interest.  Bottom Line:  If you want to lose weight and get rid of that abdominal fat, or have GI problems, cut out wheat products/carbs as much as possible. It would be a wise idea for you to check with your doctor before beginning any major changes in your diet.  I have tried adhering to DR. Davis' advice. He writes in a very interesting and sometimes amusing style.  I cut out most if not all bread, cookies, cakes pies, white potatoes and in a matter of just about 3 weeks I lost 4 lbs!!  I couldn't believe the scale, because previously (before reading this book) I was exercising on my treadmill 4 - 5 times per week at about 3.8 mph and a 5% grade for half an hour at a time but eating rolls, biscuits, wheat breads, french fries, baked potatoes, sugary chocolate and I actually was gaining weight! Now I exercise almost every day for about half an hour per day and burn about 250 - 300 calories each workout. I am feeling better, too! I plan to lose about 20 - 25 pounds over the first half of 2013. I go back in February of 2013 for my quarterly bloodwork and expect that my fasting blood glucose will be below 100, hopefully.. And I am starting to lose my abdominal fat.  I have not yet tried any of the recipes in his book but am looking forward to trying some of them--especially some of the desserts!!  By the way, if you like chocolate and feel deprived if you don't have any, try some of the 90% dark chocolate available at your supermarket.  It's not bad. Of course, it's not as sweet as all those other sweet chocolates.  Also, I like raw pecans and cubes of cheddar and monterrey jack cheese cubes for snacks.  In short, do yourself the greatest favor to improve or maintain your health and invest in Dr. Davis' book. This is my honest opinion. You wont be sorry!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Pros:<br />-- I can figure out how to stand up the Kindle Fire HD! Could never figure this out for on my earlier Kindle Fire cover.<br />-- Good selection of colors. Love the purple.<br />-- Does turn the unit off when you close it -- mostly.<br />-- Securely holds it and does what a cover is supposed to do, protect all that glass.<br />Cons:<br />-- It is very awkward to charge it in the case. Have to open the case to charge. (SEE UPDATE)<br />-- It is definitely plastic, not leather.<br />-- Pricey.<br />For the price, I just can't get that excited about it.<br />UPDATE.<br />So I feel kind of silly but I just turned around the kindle in the case and now it is easy to charge. I still could wish for a nicer material for the price I could pay so not changing the number of stars.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again Grisham has written a book that is hard  to put down! I found myself trying to figure things out, right up to the last page!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|We saw this in the theaters and knew we would own it when it came out on Blu Ray. Could it be the alpha male (wolf) was the smartest or was Liam's character. The question you have to answer at the end of this movie is who survived.<br /><br />Action filled drama. d
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob Dylan is like fine wine - just gets better through the years. Thought Modern Times was my favorite, but this one is working on replacing it as #1!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|You either love it or you hate it. If you're not hooked by episode three, give it away...&#34;Breaking Bad's&#34; not everyone's cup of blue crystal meth. Those first ones are as good as it gets on the tube. It's the TV series that jumps out light years above the rest. For home programming, this is the show by which all others will be measured from now own. Soon it will air its last Season Five finale episodes. Catch up...quick! Just do it!
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Have seen this movie a dozen times.  A bit crude but plenty of laughs.  I did not like the Hangover movies but loved this one.  Enjoy!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My wife loves this series and until now I had not paid much attention. We done and historical. I really enjoyed the first two seasons. We watched them over several evenings to get caught up in prep for season 3.<br /><br />Excellent writing and performances by all the cast. The storyline has more than a few twists.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I think it works fine - I like it and the color.  Wish it could form a holder though! SP
B002L9N4DS|5.0|I read the book several years before the movie was released, and didn't much like the book at all. In fact, I thought it sophomoricly boring and silly. But, with a good shooting script and Tom Hanks (bless'im), I think I've watch this movie in it's entirety at least a dozen times, and will watch snatches of it on TV anytime it's on.<br /><br />Since then, I have read several of Winston Groom's Civil War books, and especially enjoy &#34;Shrouds of Glory&#34; about the Battle of Franklin (TN) and &#34;Shiloh, 1862&#34;. He's quite gifted to have written them and &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; also.
B00ABKGG0C|3.0|When empires collide, the man in the middle gets crushed. Or does he? That's the question around which this saga turns, but to understand that formative moment in history, one first has to understand the formation of the man. Thus, Blood Song is A Hero In Training tale, reminiscent of Assassin's Apprentice or The Deed of Pakksenarion. Through it, we watch Vaelin Al Sorna's rise through the ranks of an elite combat training school, from the day his father abandons him at the gates of the Order, through his rise in ability and authority, and finally to his ultimate test, pinned to the pages of history, caught between two empires, and entangled in an ancient mystery. From the very first page, we are given the central question: how can one man survive against these seemingly impossible odds?<br /><br />Well told and full of the kinds of adventures that make the Hero In Training story so compelling, I read Blood Song in one long day and thoroughly enjoyed it. There were however some stumbling points for me. The story is framed in a secondary tale of an older Vaelin recounting his personal history to a scribe. But I found it maddening that during the framing scenes, the scribe had no knowledge of some of the events we had just been told. This felt to me like a violation of the narrative premise and ripped me out of the story every time it happened. I also felt the organization of the last couple of chapters felt odd - again, violations of the narrative premise. If the scribe is gone, then who is narrating the last chapter? And if the answer is Vaelin, then who is he now talking to? For many, these problems are likely invisible, but to me, they point out the risks of complicating the narrative structure.<br /><br />Bottom line: a good read, with some minor structural flaws.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that Minecraft is a great way for kids to express themselves.Even adults like myself find Minecraft a way to get away and build a house or a under water word.I really do not have any regrets of buying this game and I highly recommend this to all of you who have not tryed it.That has been another Dailystars.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I love both Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie - and together they were stellar.  A thriller from beginning to end.  Loved it.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Stellar cast, great performances all around, good storyline. Saw it years ago, enjoyed watching again. Not Gladiator or Cinderella Man, but still one of Russell Crowe's best!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I chose this book because I saw the movie and I enjoyed it. I tend to always enjoy books more and this as gain is the case.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Big fan of Bob Newhart and others in this film.  Will Ferrell does a great job-as does James Caan and supporting cast.  It's got a lot of funny lines and sequences that make you laugh.  Buddy living in an elf-sized environment is funny too.  It's a bit corny but entertaining for most people.
B000QDA7OU|5.0|Great movie.  I remembered it from when I was a teenager.  Really enjoyed seeing it again and owning it also.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|The plot did not hold my interest but I guess that isn't what most people will be watching for anyway!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The author wrote very in depth, making it feel as if you were experiencing everything that was going on. It had darkness and light, perfect mixing of both. Really was a great book!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use it on all my devices.  Works well everywhere. I love it. And it's free. What more can I say.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really good book. An easy read, but raw material. I loved it.<br />Suggest it for teenagers because it is relatable.
0525478817|5.0|After a string of mediocre books I was happy to stumble upon this book.  Poignant, mildly pensive, funny, and just an overall good story.  A smooth read.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|A classic Culture novel, with all the right elements.<br />Well written and a must for Culture devotees.<br />If you're not familiar with the series, read them in order (i.e. don't start with this one).<br />Loved it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was awesome, read it in about 4 days. Can't wait to read the others. Thoroughly recommended if it interested in suspenseful action.
B00873GRU4|1.0|I get the idea but really not well executed.<br />I found it a bit painful to read to be honest.<br />Avoid.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game, a little chalenging when you get to the hier levels, but you'll have fun with it.  We recomend this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I never really got to know the pc version, so I don't know how it compares to this. But whether it's creative, or survival, or if it's nothing like the pc one, it's a great game for everyone!

B00A3DZ61W|3.0|It's ok.  Other than the cosumes there's nothing really exciting about this game.  It's the same Angry birds as the original.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These batteries came in on time, they work and they were inexpensive.  I recommend them and I'd buy them again.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|As I stated...Andrea Bocelli can not do anything poorly.  He is a wonderful artist!  I intend to purchase more of his cds in the future.

B00701897I|5.0|My family and I really enjoyed this movie! Filled with lots of great action and great special-effects. Even better in 3D! Great story.
145162445X|5.0|Enjoyable overview of recent advances in physics that reveal details about the origin and nature of our universe. Palatable for an educated reader with no background in physics.

B002G917ZK|4.0|Love these classic movies..so glad we were able to watch it in Hi Def. The music was beautiful as well.

B005MJ883K|5.0|This maze was bought for a very intelligent 11 year old. She Loves the perplexus products. My granddaughter love this one, she advises it is harder than it looks. ( a few adult tried it-was alittle tough for them) kids have been playing this maze everyday. Love the perplexus mazes. Keep them coming.
B005DOKM9M|2.0|it does not fit the kindle fire iam going to return it. the color is nice i woulg keep  it if it fit
B00124FQCK|5.0|At least the download I got, by the way stated &#34;LP version&#34;. However, being an LP collector since my pre-teen years (that was many moons ago), I'd venture a guess that this particular album was either dubbed through a sophisticated computer program, or the record itself was brand new out-of-the-shrink wrap and slapped on the turntable. Either way, it's great. I have no complaints with the upload quality. What impressed me was that there were no skips, hisses, crackles or pops. When listening to LP's, they tend to warp, become so worn out that its noticable on playback, however, this version is very clean, deep and heavy in sound and just as good as the day it was released on LP way back when.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Great album, and well worth $3.99. Phillip Phillips can write songs too. You won't find any troubadour recordings here, so take that as you will. Phil writes inspirational songs that work well with orchestration. You also won't find any foul language, so that's a plus.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|PROS - the character is quirky and funny and this book is FULL of details about Mars, space science, NASA, botany, chemistry, physics, electronics, engineering<br /><br />CONS - its just TOO full of science for my taste. I don't even know if the details are true or made up. I want enough details to be interesting but I dont want to be overwelmed by it. I could buy a book on NASA or Mars or whatever if I really wanted that.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Loved this book...totally thru me for a loop.  It was slow moving at first but then the pieces started fitting together and I couldn't stop reading it until I figured out how it was all going to fit together!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|The history is ok but it seems that they keep trying to make more and more sequels of something that is not even worth making. Movie is ok but not much entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as you think the first book couldn't get any better this one tops it. The suspense is unreal and you definitely will not be able to put it down!
1451648537|5.0|I'm about a third of the way done, and i love it as much as i thought i would. This is a keeper!
B009HELT3C|4.0|I like they way they start the movie and how they tie the rest. Fun to watch and with great graphics.
B000055Y0X|3.0|Well in my circle of friends this was rated a Must Watch movie due to the quotable quotes.<br />However once was enough for m. Now I know where the quotes come from.<br />Its pretty memorable, some classic scenes, and the quality of the writing, acting and staging is good. The stereotypes are hilarious. In fact, the whole plot is hilarious.<br />I believe it was made to lighten the tension during the 'world might blow up into nuclear war at any time' mindset of the 1970s when we in the rest of the world just took it for granted that some loony American and loony Russian might well both get to be leader at the same time, get into a posturing match, push the red buttons, and all of us round the world would suffer the nuclear fallout. But then the Berlin Wall came down and there was Perestroika and we all stopped worrying about the Bomb without having to learn to love it.<br />Like the Pink Panther its humour is in the satirical British style, so not for when you prefer humour you don't have to think about. Unless you have seen it before.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Great game but a bit short. Worth the $1.25. Took less than 4 hours to finish. Graphics are good and easy to see.
B004RL9T50|5.0|I love the story, I love the music, I love the characters! I SIMPLY LOVE IT! I would recommend it to anybody who likes cartoons even a little bit!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I enjoyed this a lot. Good plot good animation good sound engineering.<br />Animation, but the plotline is not cutesy at all. The characters get hurt. Its not for very young children unless they have been immunised to screen violence, and following the plot does require actually watching, and not skipping huge chunks of the movie.<br />But despite the icky wormy infection things and the arrows and blood its not going to give anyone nightmares who watches Dr Who or Star Trek.
0045300232|5.0|The book was previously used and I am happy to have the opportunity to help recycle it to another book loving person. It was in good shape and arrived on time, exactly as described.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This was one of the most best books I have read in my whole<br />entire life<br /> So I recommend it
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Kept me engaged and wanting to know what was going to happen next. This was my first book on my Kindle Fire HD - great experience.
0064400557|5.0|How do you not love this book?  This was a request from my daughter for Solstice; she is four and as we read it together the illustrations (which are the original) evoke childhood and the wonder and enjoyment I experienced while reading this story.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I couldn't get enough of the first two books, but this book has me torn. I really didn't see the need for all the deaths, mainly Prim and Finnick. It was really hard to understand the thinking behind those two deaths. I really felt heart broken near the end  of the book, but thought that would change in the end. Very sad ending and I don't think it was necessary. I was also torn about her choice between Petta and Gale. . When it was obvious that she was going to choose Petra, Gale was totally out of the picture. Gale was such an important role in the book and when the choice is made he is gone.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game was the worst game I have ever spent 99 cents on ..don't waste one cent on buying this game...consider yourself warned..the game makes no sense
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Easy to play and LOTS of fun. Reminds me of all those quarters<br />I put in those arcades back in the day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazin<br />g book really keeps your interest I couldn't put it down knocked out out in two days better than fifty shades
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I'm often pretty worn out by the time I have a chance to watch a movie, so I had held off on this one for a while despite its excellent reviews because of concerns about slow pace. However, when I finally watched it, it was actually excellent. What an amazing peek into the life of royalty, and an inspiring story about the strength of will and friendship. We enjoyed it very much and I highly recommend it. While there is a good deal of profanity, I found it less concerning than in many movies, as it typically occurred as a verbal trick to help the king speak, rather than in response to any specific situation.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I would and have recommended this book to EVERYONE. Picoult has successfully written a heart-wrenching novel of young love losing it's pureness and simplicity to adult decisions.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|This game is fun but I am not that good at it. My grandson's will love it since they play these type of games a lot. I would still recommend it.
1451688091|5.0|I'm relishing going through this mighty tome 2 pages a night... taking my time... reading slowly... The recent movie was based on only a small portion of the book, but because I enjoyed the movie the book characters are coming more alive for me... The movie tie-in only gives you the cover shot of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln—but the price is right.
B005KMX866|5.0|Have always enjoy Chris Isaak.I  Bought this as a Christmas Gift for my husband. And he was very happy, especially after recently seeing him live.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|What a remarkable animated movie.  I would forget several times that I was watching an animated movie it was so close to real.  The plot would be a little scary for younger children but I loved it!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Wanted to actually read this instead of just watching the movies. Easy, quick, and fun, and certainly puts you in the holiday spirit.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A really good read.  Not too much filer.  Just a good story properly written.  Really good for pre teen to adult readers
B009KNPPS0|1.0|Honestly, I do not understand why anyone would think this is a good album or Clapton to be a great guitarist. Lame Hand is all I can say for this album. The last valid thing EC did was back in 1974 with 461 Ocean Blvd. and even then he was just an average guitarist.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Great condition.  Bought this for my daughter.  She is on her 2nd time watching the entire DVD<br />All done - nothing more to say!
B000002INR|5.0|Good tunes..
B000L212HC|5.0|love this movie. It has a great plot and keeps u guessing till the end. I would reccommend to anyone
0205313426|5.0|This book is a timeless classic and must read for anyone who writes- whether it is for profession or while in school, this book highlights many of the common mistakes that keep your piece from becoming an A or being published.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Works wonderfully! Very cute. Spilled a whole cup of water on my phone with this case on it and nothing got through. Wish it was shock proof like an Otterbox though.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I cannot think of a better word to describe this book. I was not sure about it the first few pages and at one point almost put it down,I am so glad I didn't! A definite read and book I will recommend for sure.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I declare today Colleen Hoover day.  I loved this book.  It was love, death, heartache, healing...all rolled into one.  Every character was perfect, every part was perfect.  After finishing Hopeless today I did not think my heart could take another Hoover book.  It did, barely.  I can't wait to start book 2.<br /><br />Lake's life is all sorts of complicated when she falls for the boy next door.  Will is just as drawn, but soon it becomes clear that sometimes things just can't happen as they should.  Through his past with grief he teaches her to deal with and accept hers.<br /><br />And her mother teaches her that sometimes your heart can tell you what your head can't explain.  This is a touching story that will reach in to your heart and remind you to be thankful for you moments and to never be afraid to bare your soul.
1594487154|5.0|I was already a fan of Pink's A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers will Rule the Future and Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us, so To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth about Moving Others was a natural addition to my reading list. I found it an example of true \\"Pink style\\" - striking just the right balance between sharing research on the topic, and writing in an accessible, engaging, conversational style. At times, he almost dares the reader not to turn the page or read the next section: \\"That's the basic story. To understand it more deeply, let's talk about pickles.\\" Who can't resist a teaser like that?<br /><br />I'm generally turned on by research and not usually a fan of anecdotes, but Pink's are brief, relevant and well-dispersed throughout the book. He also shares enough information in the Notes section on the research he cites that I can choose to explore it further if I choose to do so. Part of his credibility for me is that his premise about all of us being in sales are based on a study he commissioned, the \\"What Do You Do at Work\\" survey. He details just enough about the findings in the book to engage the reader and lay the foundations for his claims, but offers more on his website, a real draw for me.<br /><br />The concepts he presents in the form of the \\"new ABCs\\" of selling - Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity - can be broadly applied to anyone in any field. Hence, Pink's claim that whether we are actually in sales, or in \\"non-sales selling\\", we must all move people. \\"Moving\\" people is about persuading, influencing, and convincing others, and who among us doesn't have the responsibility of doing that from time to time? If you can't think of a time moving people is part of your job, think about your family. How often are we in positions of having to persuade, influence, or convince our partners, parents, children or even our friends?<br /><br />A true confession here: I rarely read a book cover-to-cover; I either cherry-pick what I think will interest me, or I begin the book and give up somewhere between the one-third and halfway mark. This book is the exception. Not only did I read it word-for-word and cover-to-cover, but I am reviewing favorite parts and studying Pink's advice with a plan for executing his strategies as I attempt to move others.<br /><br />\\"The ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is crucial to our survival and our happiness.\\" I'm sold on Pink's ideas about rethinking sales.<br /><br />* I received an advance copy from the publisher, but this review is my own content and reflects my own opinions.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I read these books in 3rd grade but they just blew over my head.Now I am reading them now and understanding all these AWSOME books have to offer.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very interesting. Some levels are tricky; however, when given the time, the levels are conquerable. Overall good game.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I've always had a slight fascination with mental health and illness so after reading the synopsis I knew I'd enjoy the book. What I wasn't expecting were complex characters, great dialogue and a unique story. I am definitely a fan on Matthew Quick now. Great writer, amazing book.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Discovered the free version a week ago and my daughters have been begging me to but the full.  This game is cute and fun.  My only complaint is that when drawing your figure, the line starts way to the left of where you touch the touchpad. Since my girls try to make their figures as weird as possible, this does not bother them.  Solid 4 stars on this!!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Its nice but I wish it had more to offer in terms of special features, overall still a good buy.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|It takes a special kind of person (maybe) to like these movies, but that would be me.  It was shipped quickly and in the condition advertised.  Good price for both movies together.  I didn't care about  tons of bonus features since it's all I can do to even find time to watch a movie.  Simplicity = Good movie, put it in, watch it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Its excellent! Blu Ray looks wonderful, a lot of special features on the disk. The Bat-mobile documentary was very interesting.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Grisham has come up with a unique formula. But then doesn't he always? Though obviously written for young folks I love them also.
B008J34466|5.0|The CD was in perfect condition.  Great music.  This is her first CD that I have listened to and it is great!
B005USZML4|5.0|Another example of Grisham's ability to come up with an unusual plot. Theodore will become a terrific lawyer. I hope Grisham lets him grow up and continues the series.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Movie was in perfect shape and as advertised.  It is a classic that we will never get tired of !!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Exciting story with a well known character.  Definitely a page-turner, but not his best ever.  Certainly worth the time it takes to read.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Need I say anything.  As everyone else has shown by by the awards she received, an absolutely great voice, variety of styles and an unique person.  Hope more follows!!!  The CD was new and perfect, as advertised.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Since newest update, cannot delete comments or change cover photo on mobile! Seems something gets worse with every update, please fix!
1423140605|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  She has read almost everything by this author and is so happy to own her own copy.  The book was in perfect, new condition.  It is the beginning of a collection, I'm sure.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is cool .........outr first game purchase ever. Think of folks who played Pac-Man then never updated.........that's us, cave men and women.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven, was incredible from the beginning details to very end! Often when reading his books I worry about the sad part coming, with this book I couldn't wait for the climatic point!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book. It draws you in immediately. Every time you think there can be no more surprises...gotcha. ;) only bad thing I can say is I was not thrilled with the ending.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i like this game. my grandkids really really like it.  had to purchase the star wars angry birds. very pleased with my purchase, definitely worth the apprx. $3.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and I thought the $2,99 was worth it. I would. reccomend this game. Just wish. it had. been longer! :-)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've never been much of a reader. I never had time EVER to read books. A number of people told me I should read this trilogy. I have to say, this is the best trilogy I have ever read. It's a page turner. It also gives some great ideas for couples. ;)
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blokus is fun every time we play.  I introduced it to my parents over Christmas and they picked it up quickly and enjoyed.  It is always fun to watch other people's strategies and try to guess their next moves.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this just because it was all the hype, but I really wish I wouldn't have wasted my time or money. I found this book more disturbing than anything.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I would rate this book 4 stars because the book was really good and funny. This book was really interesting for me and my sister's. I wouldn't rate this 5 stars because Jeff Kinney could have added on to the book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful book<br />I loved it great sex scenes, really gitvme horny. I recommend everyone to read this great book<br /><br />Wow
B004H4XDBI|4.0|This was so good. Adam is just so perfect too bad he's fictional.<br />It was the best conclusion to this interesting stories.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Can not wait till the next book I already pre-order it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! < 3
B0063IH60K|5.0|GREAT I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME-I LIKE THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE BACKGROUND AND THE BACK OF THE CARDS
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved everything about this book. Katniss never gave up and had me wondering what her next move would be.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and I thought it was pretty funny. I bought it since I love this type of movie and I've already watched it 3 times over the weekend. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for some lighthearted fun.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|plowed through it  but this was the lamest batman ever......i didnt think i would ever fast forward through a batman movie
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I watched this show live on shotime when it was on and just had to have it. I recommend this how to anyone who likes thrillers.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|lots of fun and great for everyone.the cast was perfect and scenery was beautifully captured.  I would put this on a must see list
B007IXWL2C|4.0|All three books have been great. This book was really good and I didn't want to put it down every.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|that's how much it is to remove the annoying ads at the bottom. oh yea and the huge full screen ones at the end of every other level. i want the hd version but i don't want pay 5 bucks to remove ads there too. seriously 5 dollars the game just came out and u want 5 bucks for no ads wtf is this. the games pretty epic by the way i just overreact with advertisements i hate them
1451695195|5.0|The book is very well written and the message in the book is the greatest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Proof of Heaven is so very wonderful and I reccommend it to everyone.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Because<br /><br />The New York Times re potted York Times and every time you have any idea how many of the world is going to get to know<br /> that they were not the only thing I can see
B002GIBVWA|4.0|If you are looking for academy award material or matrix stuff this is not the movie, but if you want a movie that will warm your heart, this is the one. Keanu Reeves is his STIFF self, but over all this is one of my favorites.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Shipped later than they said. Found it cheaper a few weeks later so I should have waited.  I love this movie though.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Best Comedy since Anchorman, If you like Family Guy you will love this movie.  Best Best Best Best Best Best
0393343405|5.0|I bought the book at a book store in May, but put off reading it until this month.  I found it to be educational and a very fun/interesting read.  A combination that I find to be rare.  I expected to read some grand theory about human development.  Instead, I was pleasantly presented with a very interesting story about the life a man.  A man that I had never before heard mentioned; but which the author goes on to demonstrate had a very real and tangible impact on my life and beliefs.  Highly recommended, and I will be reading other works of the author on the basis of this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't  normally read books like this, but once I did I couldn't stop. Now I can't . Wait to start book 2. Definitely recommending this book to my friends.
159420411X|4.0|I have been looking for a decent explanation of Bayesian statistics, which is accessible to lay people, for some time.  This book is a great step in the right direction.  I found the first section of war stories interesting, but a bit too long.  Once you get to the section on how to improve your thinking, you are well rewarded.  I would even suggest that you read only the chapter that interest you in the first section...
0345535421|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift, and recipient was thrilled to receive it.  Had read first of the series, so was anxious to start this one.  Fast delivery service, too.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|Kindle fire does not lock into cover thereby causing kindle to fall out of the cove.  I will have to be very careful to prevent this happening again..
B007FEFLTO|3.0|enjoyed the first book of the trilogy, but could'nt get into part 2.  I looked forward to this book but can't say the same about the third
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Acting was superb, violence non existent....its the story of life as it really is and the human<br />desire to just keep things going.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A must read! Had me in tears and I don't cry over books, but this wonderful story was so well written that I felt every emotions the characters felt. I highly recommend you read this outstanding story.
B003PDQEBS|5.0|This film ultimately is about being human, and recognizing the small, unplanned moments of beauty in life.  The period detail from the 60s is perfect, and the characters are wonderful.  The fact that the main character George is gay is largely irrelevant, in that this movie is not about being gay...it is about feeling deeply happy when we are able to connect with another that we feel understands us and cares about us \\"as we are\\".  It is not flashy, not \\"trying to make a statement,\\" and therein lies its excellence.  Watch the extras about the \\"Making of...\\" I appreciated Tom Ford's style before this movie, and now after it, I appreciate his skill as a Director even more.<br />This is a beautiful film to watch when you are in the mood to think deeply about the things that really matter...I did not want it to end.
1451695195|2.0|I didn't want to read a biography about this doctor, I wanted to read about his  experience in heaven. He doesn't tell what he learned or what he did there. In fact he really doesn't say to much about it at all.The book just kept going in circles! Don't write a book if your not going to share YOUR experience. I really wanted this book and waited till I could afford it and now I am so disappointed. I wish I would have read the reviews first. Sorry to be a crusher but it just didn't tell of your experience.
B007VUCAVO|1.0|This was the first app I bought for my Kindle Fire HD, to replace the free version. The Pro (paid) version does not do anything anymore than the free version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! It kept you on the edge of your seat and it was the perfect ending to the trilogy!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love my Kindle Fire so it was important to find me a cover that would make me feel safe and secure.<br />I immediately looked at the $45 & up Kindle covers and thought I want to feel safe and secure for my Kindle<br />but I need to eat..  When I saw the Marware I liked the price but never heard of the product.  I read the reviews<br />most were favorable.  So I purchased it.<br />  I love it.  It holds my Kindle securely in place and holds it up like a stand.<br />Highly recommend it.  Its great and doesn't cost an arm and a leg;)
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I liked it but I think it was a little short of a book. But the story has a great storyboard. Please write more Kinney!
B004XWLN20|5.0|My son and family have watched these many times and really enjoy having them.  They collect movies and videos and watch them over and over.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Has anyone ever noticed that this book is more than love and a chance to survive. I love the way the author put their love life to be complicated. They finally find each other and soon their separated. This story just wants you to keep on reading.
B000001E21|4.0|I had some doubts about an album made-up entirely of songs that didn't make the cut from previous albums, but this definitely has some great songs.  One Step Behind is my favorite.  Fractured Love, Ring of Fire and I Wanna Be Your Hero are the most like the Def Leppard I've come to love.  Some of the other songs are growing on me!
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Some stupid ,slapstick comedy but also some interesting performances. Best was Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy). The a capella singing was actually pretty good and made this movie bearable.
B001R1G01O|5.0|My wife and I have seen this twice and have shown to our parents, who especially enjoyed the post-WW2 music, scenery, and culture.  The Hollywood Communist &#34;witch hunts&#34; are a key part of the plot, and as a result, there is also a pretty good tribute to the US Constitution as the movie resolves.  Jim Carrey is great in this drama.
030758836X|2.0|Nick is the prime suspect for the murder of his wife Amy, who has disappeared on their fifth anniversary. He is crucified by the press, more for being a cheating husband than for being a killer.  Nick eventually learns that Amy is a manipulative psychopath with a scary history.  Told in alternating chapters by Nick and Amy, the first 200 pages are boring, and readers are advised to skip all of Amy's diary.  In the second half, however, both narratives are important, and the story is very, very good - until the author slips up with a bad ending.  The author's huge plotting mistake is that Desi's mother knows the truth, but she is jettisoned from the story.  Aside from the inclusion of too much diary, smacking of chick-lit, the author's weakness is that most of the characters, including Nick's sister, are cardboard.  I had heard this was a love-it-or-hate-it book, but if half fails, then the entire book fails.  I can only assume that those who put this on their 2012 best-list, did not read Lee Child's The Affair or Mark Allen Smith's The Inquisitor, or a host of 2012 fiction and nonfiction that far surpassed this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love these books. Have read twice now really hoping for a fourth. Could not put it down. A must read.
B007WZ55XI|5.0|Must have if training with power! Learned so much by reading this book. Can get a little technical at times but its not a one time read. This is one you will refer to as you train.
075669812X|5.0|I just love the product; and my son was exicted to receive it as a gift for him this Christmas.<br /><br />Great product, value for money and, it ass to the rare Characters Collection!<br /><br />Cheers<br />Sony
0553582038|2.0|I started the book series after seeing Game of Thrones.  The author was able to instill feelings in the reader about the very flawed characters and bring you through the twists and turns of the plot so well that you get drawn in and can't wait to see what will happen next.  Several things I hated, such as the downfall of the Stark family; I lost track of how many times Arya was captured in previous books, and also have to wonder about all the mention of the wolves in each of the books.  But, I was hooked on the story itself.<br /><br />My problem with this book is that I do not care about most of these characters.  I have no idea who most of them are, and I am halfway through the book.  Why Martin did this at this time, I don't know; you get hooked on the books because you care about the characters, you love them, you hate them, you want the king to die, etc.  When you don't know who the people are and don't care, you get bored.  The only interesting things I am reading are about Jamie.  Brienne has always seemed like a weak character, and Cearsi doesn't require more depth than she has already.  I just feel like Feast of Crows has taken away from the flow of the story and replaced it with odd things, such as bringing Caitlyn back from the dead.  And I sorely miss Tyrian in this story.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I love this movie! My husband and I are in our late 20s and we went to see it in theatres, thinking it would be a silly kids movie, but it's incredibly clever and quite heartfelt. The animation is fantastic and the voice cast is impressive. Viewers of all ages will really enjoy this movie, I recommend adding it to your Christmas collection!
B009HEMF1M|5.0|An amazing array of talent takes what could be a very formulaic movie and transforms it to a rollicking fun flick. Well worth the time to watch.The interplay between Willis and Malkovitch alone is worth it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. We love it! So nice to have the whole trilogy in a Blu-Ray set. I have seen that others are complaining that it doesn't come with a bunch of books and collectors crap which I am SO happy about. When we buy movies, we buy them for the movie not all the extra paper and garbage that they usually include. This does have a little collectors book with it that my husband did actually look through once but I doubt we will ever touch it again!
1851775722|4.0|Although this book is full of stunning garments and gorgeously photographed with most of the clothing described well in great detail, I was very annoyed with its arrangement. I am the curator at a museum with a fine clothing collection (although nothing like the V&A) and I was particularly interested in the women's garments of the late 1860s to early 1880s (a favorite period) as well as any other women's outfits. Although as a curator and as someone who does exhibits I can understand the choice to present items according to a theme, I found this approach extremely frustrating. It would have been much better if the clothing had been presented in chronological order so that comparisons were easy to make and there was a  natural progression as styles were changed bit by bit through tailoring, drapery and foundation garments.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this series!  The writers always keep you guessing and have no problem killing off main characters. There is love & betrayal...violence & passion.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking Bad is a shocking story and tells of a lifestyle entirely unknown to me. Great drama! You will stay up all hours of the night to watch the episodes to see what happens next. Never disappointing.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I may be overrating this due to my love of the original movie but I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone. It was funny and the plot was infinitely better than the second one.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted is more than endearing entertainment.  It provides a lesson to all about the maturing process and love.  I highly recommend this movie to all.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Very funny and fun movie to watch, but some of the innuendo was a bit too much for our family.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This version of &#34;Total Recall&#34; should not be compared to the previous version with Arnold.  It stands well on its own.  If you appreciate action movies then this one is for you.
B001FOPODS|4.0|I found this version would be better for older children. I will use it to concentrate more on the music
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Anyone expecting to see another great movie with Matt will be disappointed.  The plot is messed-up and quirky.  All that being said once you get beyond the first fifteen minutes of the movie it becomes another global chase adventure around the world.  So sit back and forget about the past and enjoy the ride.
B00006AG5N|4.0|Good buy and what can I say............it's Elvis.  Great sound and arrived in perfect condition.  Good buy and I will enjoy for years.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great movie - lots of action, good plot, and surprising ending for the Batman movies. Opens the door for the next series which will not include Batman.
B00005JNX0|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and wanted to watch it with her friends for her birthday, unfortunately, we didn't own it.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This was a great written and well acted movie, and hilarious as well. Best comedy I have see in a long time. Would definitely recommend
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. I'm glad Amazon had it. But it was a bit expensive for something I will only be watching once
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Once I began reading this book it was impossible for me to put it down. I laughed at all the characters' antics and teared up at all of the emotional parts. This was a really good read, and I appreciate the author for sharing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|He played it on my phone first. Then I downloaded for my Kindle. He wants it for his NABI. Is it available?
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is foul.  I think the rated version might not have been so bad, but an hour and fifty-three minutes of adolescent humor was really more than I could take.
B00797MB0O|3.0|The main character is a sociopath. She is everyone you hated in high school and every girl you ever meet and instantly dislike now. I wish a bus ran her over or she fell off a cliff the entire movie. If you didn't know what a sociopath is, watch the movie and you will now!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I enjoy this game a whole bunch.  The longer you play it the better you get at the game. Tons of fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun and challenging and a great way to pass the time. I played it for hours while visiting my nephew in the hospital.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|excellent app, I totally recommend it, don't give it 5 stars bc the menu interface could be a lit more better.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Funny and a bit over the top.  I would watch it again. But it's a bit like watching Family guy,
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|the graphics are terrible. it looks like tiles are un unblocked but they are not! and that makes yoy waste time. I wish you would play against the clock, that makes it challenging and motivates to even play more!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I recommend this book for any body who loves Christmas stories and for people who wants a good laugh about what could happen to someone and their little brothers turns off the heat
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i do not like littlest pet shop now butthen i was 7years old i loveit . all i wanted for my b-day is littlest pet shop .This game makes me think of the time i play with my pet shops. I'm go to look for my pet shop :')
B0063IH60K|1.0|The games are those &#34;canned&#34; already out there/available for cell phones as free downloads; nothing new or challenging about them.  The displays are unattractive for the most part; need redesign to please clients on Kindle Fire HD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I had sooooooo much fun figuring out the puzzles. I got this game for free, but I bought it so that I could get all the puzzle packets.
B0086700CM|1.0|Yawn.  The variables are little to none, yet the graphics are quick and responsive.  Need WIFI to download to my Kindle Fire HD.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I think that this app works really well on the kindle fire.<br />I have it in my drop down menu so I can quickly see how low or high my battery is. this app is truly amazing
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|What a voice... Whitney is one of a kind & I am so glad we have it all to enjoy... we miss you Whitney !!!
0545425115|1.0|This book did not live up to all the hype it received. Reading this book confirms that just because something is popular doesn't mean that it's good. I found the premise of the book to be barbaric. The fact that mere children are set against each other to fight to the death for survival was stupid because there was no logical reason for it in this story. Also, why the children, why didn't the adults take a stand against that nonsense? I did not see  the point. The book was not exciting. The chapters were long and boring. This book was horrible.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I have seen the Beach Boys now 7 times in Concert. I was 17 when I first saw them (my very first concert) ... they just keep getting better & the 2012 50 year concert was simply the best ever. Great DVD, great to see Brian Wilson seriously on his game again... &#34;Good vibrations&#34; in 2012 !!!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A blast from the past - great 80s movie.  Bought it for my 20 year old daughter and had it shipped to her at college.  She loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the way I only have to tap the card for it to move to the correct position, and if I want to choose where it goes I can move it directly to the position I want.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There is only one reason I rated Pinterest 5 stars: I couldn't rate it 1,000,000,000! Easy to use, clear pictures, and never freezes or crashes. Never not worked for me on my Kindle Fire. LOVED LOVED  LOVED! What would my life be without Pinterest?
B004TI5N38|4.0|This is my first time reading one of Balduccis books.  I enjoyed it. Can't wait to read the next one.
0525953728|4.0|This turned out to be a great gift forum step-father who is a veteran and is all about reading. I can't wait til he is finished with it so I can borrow it. When he is all finished with his books, he donates them to our local library. Everyone wins.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THIS GAME IN VEGAS AND AT FAIRS-i could not drag myself away from it.  So, now I find this game available to me 24-7!! I am so hooked that even if I wake up during the night, I have to run over and play a few coins!! Love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was a great deal and a great addition to any collection.  I mean who doesn't want to own all The Godfather films?! Its a classic and for the price I'm happy with this purchase.
1419705849|5.0|I can't comment on content, but my children adore this series. Even my son, who hates reading will sit down and read these books.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Some funny moments, but uneven and overall, unsubstantial. Might have been better suited to episodic TV. Wahlberg & Kunis sell it well.
0756404738|5.0|I've read hundreds of sci-fi/fantasy novels over the years and I have to admit that this is above and beyond anything I could have imagined. It's that good! The plot lines are so intricate and expertly interwoven that it's no surprise that some out there just don't get why the second novel is the way it is. Follow the clues people!<br />\\"The Kingkiller Chronicle\\" is a masterpiece! Patrick Rothfuss is a mad,storytelling genius!  There's seven words.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I have read hundreds of books, but few have held my attention as well as Shantaram. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone it is just spectacular.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I thought it was o.k.. I though  I was o.k. because  I  had big words an  I don't do big words. I also had to constantly highlight the word and get the  definition for the words...because I didn't know what they meant!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing this game it is so much fun.it chould be called temple fun.fun fun fun that's all it is.
B00633W614|5.0|The end of this book was the same ending as the first in this trilogy.  You still don't know who Harry's father is.  It is getting a little boring to say the least.  By the third book you don't really care who is father is.
B000SZNET6|5.0|Action Packed with great one liners. A true holiday classic.  Bruce Willis at his youngest and best is a delight!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|The singers had great harmony.  My wife is an ACA-aficionado and she loved this movie.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys ACA.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was absolutely beautiful. :) I'm glad I bought it and I love Nicholas Sparks books anyhow so this was a good buy for me. :)
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Good fantasy story.  Good plot; good writing!  I always looked forward to reading this book especially on my Kindle!  Amen
B009H442DG|5.0|I loved this CD.  Maybe it's because it was songs I usually enjoy this time of year, or maybe it's because hearing Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta transports me back to a time in my life when I life was a little less complicated.  Most of all though, I appreciate artists who make a point of sending proceeds to charity.  It's not only allows them this opportunity, but I as a consumer have the chance to learn about the needs of a charity worthy of support.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This maze is definitely challenging and worth the purchase for an older child. It features several levels to challenge even the most maze savvy person. It comes with its own stand for play-pause, allowing you to keep your spot to continue later.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my 18 year old gran daughter.  She spend too much time on her iPad.  But that aside this makes her feel like she has a laptop.
B008NNNF7G|3.0|I really like what this group is capable of and they have some really good and diverse songs on this album. However, there are 3 or 4 songs which are formula Nashville cheese and the album sounds overproduced much of the time. Their album Bad Luck Ain't No Crime was much better in my opinion with more energy and a more raw sound and it definitely rocked harder. Still worth a buy, especially for $5!
B002WWKZJK|5.0|A splendid tale well told with superb characters well drawn.  One of my favourite Heyers. A great pleasure to read.  One book I have read several times.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This app is very creative. An app for all ages. If you really appreciate art you'll love it even more. I'm a person who appreciates any type of art. Anywhere from the Mona Lisa to even a stick figure. This is fine art and creativity that's takentothe next level. So much fun to play and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to have a good time. Fun for all ages.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've had to use this app a few times and I've had no problems from it. It loads quickly, gets  the answers you need with no b.s., and has an intuitive design that anyone could use, even if they haven't used a real calculator before. I have no complaints and wouldn't think twice about getting another app from this developer.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A mildly entertaining ride to nowhere. nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere
B009IF82SK|5.0|bought the first 11 episodes to watch during flying over the xmas holidays.  the episodes were very clear and no problems to report.  the one thing that is disappointing is i had to use the desktop site to purchase the episodes as the amazon video app does not do that, but that is not what i am reviewing here.  the episodes themselves are very nice.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Not sure why someone would put out a game that you can find no clues to help solve puzzles. The first puzzle is some squares on a wall.  What are you supposed to do, try out every pattern and sequence until you hit the right one. Its a game to be fun and entertaining not boring waste of time
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Ewan McGregor gives an outstanding performance. Very well done. And the story line is interesting; it makes you stop and think of the possibilities. For the most part, the scientific references behind the project were accurate; a few mistakes but those can be overlooked in the grand scheme of things. It was a pleasant and enjoyable surprise; much better than I'd expected.
1451673442|5.0|I have bought this little book for friends and plan to buy more. Practical suggestions for a life of gratitude.
B005XT4932|4.0|It just reminds me of good times when I was younger. That's all. I don't have the knowledge to pick it apart like hardcore musicians or music critics. I just like it.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|What a great show. I remember loving this show as soon as it came out. Not a big Air Force fan at the time and had no idea what OSI stood for but I was a huge comic book fan and this was the closest thing to a real-life superhero show at the time. Also, a huge fan of the special bionics sound effects of the show, still brings a smile to ones face when hear it. I would recommend this to any comic book fan or sci-fi buff.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just want to say I LOVE Colleen Hoover, I loved the Slammed series, and I absolutely love Hopeless.  My very first amazon review has to be given to Colleen Hoover for being such a brilliant writer and amazing story teller and for creating unforgettable characters that leave lasting impressions.  She deserves all the success in the world!! Go get this book, then do yourself a favor and get Slammed and Point of Retreat because they are just as great!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome. Will read over and over again. Will also recommend to my friends and family. Can't wait to read the next one.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I use this as a &#34;soundtrack&#34; so the normal 2 CD set is on one DVD so we can listen to the entire play - with or without watching it.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The title says it all. Cassandra Claire has such an amazing series here!!! You will not be disappointed with the Mortal Instruments books.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|It was ok Hollywood version of history brought it for my husband who is retired air force who like me not that impressed with content would not recommend it must be better films about the red tails than this
1609611543|5.0|Well written book and the information can change your life if you let it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Did not seem to have the depth of structure that I have come to expect from Clancy. Still an enjoyable read.
098555780X|5.0|Great visual explanations for the novice and experienced knotter. JD also has a You Tube channel for those who wish to see most of his work in video.  Check it out and buy the book, it will make a great addition to your library.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Well it was based one one thing throughout the whole book... quite short. Funny though liked the ending. Would recommend for children at the age of 8-9.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Easy to read! Paticipating in this hearfelt ride with all of the happiness, sadness, anger, and philosophical rendering through these eyes of this loyal family member was humbling.  Thank you for allowing me to come along.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I read it in one night (tonight) and its four a.m.  Need I say more?  So touching, insightful, captured human emotion and great for any generation.  I'm 30, searching for the old me and this really spoke to me.  Highly recommended
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I loved it. The movie is definitely not for little kids but I had a lot of laughs from it.
B0013ND30M|4.0|As always Disney makes a good quality product. We have most of the Disney movies and needed to add this to the collection.
B009CG955Y|5.0|My daughter can't watch this movie enough... The lorax is cute,and sassy.the singing fish our favorites,and The onesler was happy at first but then was sad, this movie takes her through almost every emotiion. And she feels good at the end.. Love it !!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I chose the 4 star rating because I couldn't put this book down, but it's not one of those books where I don't want it to end. The characters were well fleshed out, quirks, flaws, and virtues.  One of the most important factors for me to suspend disbelief are how believable the characters reactions were based on their personality and reasonable humanity.  At no point did I fall out of the story due to unlikely interactions of the characters.  The plot was well planned with a good pace, and I didn't notice any inconsistencies.  The book dealt with some heavy issues with grace and tact.  I would recommend this book for late teens all the way up to anyone who can relate to characters in their late teens.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this is a wonderful movie.  I loved the hold thing.  It was touching and inspirational. I have recommended to severalfriends and also lent mine out.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this app.  They had contests to see who could make the craziest hair.  They also like creating characters that looked like the other family members.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I truly liked this movie.  I am please with the movie plot. I happen to like all the old Ape movies.
0783231032|5.0|Love this movie! I don't like how they have word minimums in the reviews. I Need six more words, words,words.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this trilogy! I fell in love with the characters and was so sad to read the last story. I hope there's more from his point if view!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This book was quick and very fun little read. We as people like to personify our animals, \\"I Could Pee on This \\" did so successfully. I enjoyed it very much.
0762434260|3.0|The Harry Potter Wand kit is very cute and fun to piece together. However, I found that with the last part that you screw together, the screw was too big for the base of the wand and we had to wedge it in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really awesome so easy to read.spent one weekend devouring it and I'm doing to read the next one in the series!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|This is a great game for tennis players &amp; lovers. It's fun and I enjoy it. Love playing this game when I can
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This compilation could not be more entertaining! I was so surprised how well they still play together. I bought one for a friend for a gift after viewing the videos and hearing the CD's. I have always been a fan so I may be a bit biased. But isn't everyone a fan? You will not be disappointed!
B000006V5H|5.0|Highly recommend this cd...<br />Great selection of songs from a very talented singer...For all fans of John Farnham I recommend this cd.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|Never got to use it, it said corrupt and never loaded. I will stick with quick office. I would rather pay money to quick office then use a program that messes up before it even opens
B004DNWPY4|4.0|It does not show you how to become a millionaire and give you a full picture of a real millionaire!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book is incredible. The lesson in this book seems to be so simple but is something that is overlooked and overshadowed by our superficial ideas of talent and brilliance. Success never happens on its own and requires more than just natural ability and hard work, it requires fortunate circumstance, and seizing of opportunities.<br />Very good read!
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was awesome and Jeff  Kinney did a great  job  on this and all his diary of a wimpy kid books and now his  movies.I give it 5 stars.
B0083GR6Y6|3.0|While this movie was gripping, it was unrelentlessly bleak. I would not recommend it for kids, the faint of heart, or wolf lovers. Part wilderness survival, part horror, all hopelessness. But, it does make Minnesota winters seem balmy.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I really enjoy the easy to use controls and stunning graphics. It us a very addictive game hard 2 put down
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|It's wonderful to finally have the full set.  This is one of the best series of all time.  Peter Falk is brilliant.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was on of Nicolas Sparks' best books. The only bad thing I have to say about it was the ending should have been elaborated more.
1400069289|5.0|I got this for my husband for one of his business classes, and he is using quite a lot of it in his teaching this semester.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love is in the air for Greg and Rowley! This book is the best of all! If you're looking for a funny book, this is the next to buy!
B003SHYVO8|4.0|Held my attention the whole time, the story wasn't bad and the final dance sequence was epic. I have no more words.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think the hunger games series are the best books I have ever read I have read them all twice and I still am glued to the pages and smiling and the romantic parts between the star crossed lovers from district 12<br />I consider this books series to all ages and to people who love romance and action books<br />I gave this book a 5 star rating because it will keep you glued to the pages till the very last one then you wont be able to wait till you read the two other books in the hunger games series Catching Fire and Mocking Jay
0735619670|5.0|Read it then read it again. In interviews for developers I always ask if they own this book. It's a daunting read but certainly worth it.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Not so funny and kind of crude for a teddy bear!  It did not show up the acting skills of the real people in it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Thanks Amazon for listing this book!  It really helped me start myself out on publishing directly on Kindle.  Now I think I will need how to Market my book through Amazon and Kindle.  This was a great help!
1451638647|5.0|I don't often read books as soon as they're printed, but I'm on an elist that is rereading the entire series. And this arrived just in time for the group read. Although Miles Vorkosigan, the focus of the series, isn't on stage much, it's a pleasure to see just a bit of how &#34;Ivan, you idiot!&#34; actually thinks. And finally meets his romantic match. And almost succeeds in staying behind the scenes. Typical of Bujold, it's well-written, full of interesting characters and recurring friends, and makes one laugh out loud, along with a cracking good story worthy of any space opera. It can be read alone, but I'd recommend starting the series from the chronological beginning (Shards of Honor and Barrayar, combined in Cordelia's Honor). Like this book, they all tend to be a combination of space adventure and romance, interesting plots and characters that will become family. I've read science fiction all of my reading life (over 50 years), and these books rank up there with the best. You shouldn't regret giving them a try.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a fantastic book and loved every minute of it! Now I'm not a very fast reader so normally books about this length take me a week or so, but I couldn't put this book down. I ended finishing it in about 8 hours total. One of favorites!
0062103377|5.0|Reed is a writer/script coordinator for Supernatural, and it shows. This is a journal written in Bobby's voice, when he's back from a hunt and is losing his memories. He's writing everything he can remember that he wants left behind (except for his library lore), while he's trying to use his swiss-cheese memory to figure out what has happened.<br />As a result we get some hunting tips, some old stories (more on how he and Rufus met, and how after his wife died, he became a hunter -- after running away to Japan -- and becomes Rufus' partner, and just a bit more on how he screwed that up). Of course, he figures out how the hunt went wrong and saves himself and the boys, and their memories, by book's end.<br />But it's deliciously in Bobby's voice with crude illustration and papers taped to pages, which often had me smiling and laughing out loud. He's an irascible, loveable, non-idjit, and his personality shines through this. I'd not recommend this to a nonfan, but it's good fare for the fan. This is one that stays in my library (G).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved the relationship between sky and holder. was sad for the book to end. buy this book! i will be reading it again i'm sure! all of colleen hoovers books are fantastic!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Good movie, fun to watch. If you just want to enjoy a lighthearted movie with a fantasy story line, watch this one.  Would not advise viewing by children.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Nothing better than Nathan Fillion on my TV. Oh, wait. There is. Nathan Fillion on my TV in every episode of Firefly.
0955153077|5.0|I gave this as a gift for Christmas and it was well received.  The recipient was quite happy with the book and it looks like it will help them with their digital work.  The book is quite lovely and looks to have lots of great information and tutorials on how to get certain looks through your digital program.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Better then the second, worse then the first. Tommy mailed this one in, fortunately he isn't in it for too long. The villain was pretty cool.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Okay so my daughter loved this app and she was interested in the music and asked if there was a backstory to the setting (aka the dates and the bookshelves) I told her I didn't know but I would write a review asking for more information on it. So could you please put more details in the description explaining the raindrops backstory. The only thing I didn't like was that this app constantly asked me to write a review and it seems like (from what I've read) other people agree with me. I recommend this app.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I did not know that ads would pop up every time I started a  new game.  do not usually go for apps, will not get any more because of this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great problem solving game.  It challenges your mind but at the same time it is very fun.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever. I love they way he leaves us hanging at the end.the best book I have ever read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book,  this is not normally my kind of read but Wow.  It is a story with may twist and turn it.  I never thought that it would turn out the way that it did.  For some people this might be a tear joker.  I love the path that sky took and her quest to discover who she is and what life is dispute everything that is going on.  To me this is a must read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read. By far. If you consider buying this book, do it. Right now. This book has emotion, great quotes, as well as a few laughs. I will never regret reading this book!
B0095R64AO|1.0|This movie was a waste of film or digital or whatever they are using today. I would say miss this one!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as well written as the first book of the series. It is rushed, with less twists and suspense, but more strangers to keep you guessing what type of personality Collins gave each one.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was better and more entertaining than most I have seen recently. Watch it love it and remember the sayings.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I think it was too long and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone so don't read it. THANKS By,love you (not)
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this cd. The song choices and Brandon's voice makes a cd that even an old woman like me can listen to over and over again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like this app it gives you awesome ideas like for a birthday party or new year eve party awesome
B007SGM084|5.0|#1love story of all time in my book...I would have given it 20 stars if they were except able .. Thank you E L James for writing my favorite book, can't stop rereading. Going to be hard hard book to ever match!,
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love it when the thing  happened.cool stuff like girls and women in here and kisses for a girlfriend r things
B002BWP49C|5.0|Still obsessed, I think that I could develop a PHD thesis around the personality differences in the people who would choose Jacob over Edward!!!  :-)
B005LAII62|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Paranorman, the new stop action animated horror comedy, comes from the creators of Coraline, the 1999 Alice in Wonderland-like stop action animated feature, which garnered fairly good reviews. I faulted Coraline for its lack of originality and characters that didn't have enough charm. I'm sad to report that Paranorman represents a big step backward for the creators of Coraline, as it's much more derivative than its precursor and manages to exude significantly less charm.<br /><br />  The film starts off nicely as we slowly pan through the town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, which reminds one of a working-class section of Boston or any of those eastern or central Massachusetts towns that happen to feature rows of houses built in the 20s and 30s. We meet the film's protagonist, Norman Babcock, a boy with psychic powers who can communicate with his deceased grandmother inside the house as well as numerous ghosts out on the street. Norman is one of those 'misunderstood' kids who's ridiculed at school as a freak and forms a friendship with another outcast at school, Neil, an overweight kid, who is also constantly bullied.<br /><br />  In 'Coraline', most of the characters were eccentric but in 'Paranorman', except mainly for Norman and Neil, all the other characters, who are supposed to be funny, are actually either grotesque, mean-spirited or ignorant (some all of the above). The film's animators chose to highlight all the characters' negative attributes by exaggerating their physical deficiencies. For example, Norman's father, Perry, has an enormously protruding pot belly. He's also entirely unsympathetic as he considers his son's interest in psychic phenomena, an embarrassment to the family as well as the community at large. The Paranorman scenarists also fail to get any laughs from Norman's sister Courtney, who proves to be a caricature of a narcissistic teenager who's desperate to find a boyfriend. At the end of picture, we're supposed to laugh when she's rejected by Neil's older flat-topped, super-buffed Ron Howard looking brother, Mitch, who turns out to be gay.<br /><br />  Today it seems whenever we have a story about a young outcast, he'll always be pitted against a school bully. In this case it's Alvin, who sports a pig-like face and bears a faint resemblance to Bruce Willis. The obnoxious Alvin attempts to torment sensitive Norman until he realizes that everything his opponent is saying about a witch's curse that may destroy the town, comes true. Mrs. Henscher, the schoolteacher, is fairly amusing when she attempts to convince her school kids to emote better while they're performing a play about the 300th anniversary of the town, but later turns ugly (sporting a mud cake facial), joining a mob full of vengeful townspeople, who riot when faced with a group of hapless Zombies. There's also Sheriff Hooper, the overzealous police officer who thinks of shooting first and asking questions later (as the only African-American, some folks may find this character overly stereotypical).<br /><br />  Saving the worst character for last is Norman's deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who lives on the edge of town and resembles the town drunk--an individual who everyone in the town tries to avoid. Before Prenderghast has a heart attack and dies, he explains that the town is cursed by a little girl who was hung as a witch and took revenge on the seven Puritan townspeople from 300 years ago, who sentenced her to death. In an awfully tasteless scene, after Prenderghast kicks the bucket, rigor mortis sets in and the lifeless, stiff body falls on little Norman--who must extricate himself, not before being licked by the corpse's loose and gross, saliva-filled tongue.<br /><br />  In addition to all the unlikeable and charmless characters, there's also the amazingly derivative story line. Without the so-called comedy, 'Paranorman' would just be your average Zombie movie. The twist is that Paranorman cops out by becoming completely sentimental. The Zombies were not originally a hate-filled mob who sentenced poor little Agatha to death--they were merely 'afraid'. And now Norman points out, the mob full of Blithe Hollow denizens, have becomes just as bad as their cowering ancestors.<br /><br />  Norman ends up by making everything right by engaging in a 'heart-to-heart' with the now demented and vengeful little Agatha. Once Norman gets through to Agatha, the souls of the seven Zombies, finally make it to their eternal resting spots (along with of course, little Agatha) and Norman's family and the rest of the town, learn an important lesson about being tolerant of kids with extra sensory abilities as well as Zombies who were not actually hate-crazed bigots, but merely innocently caught up in the mass hysteria of their times.<br /><br />  Now all that's left is to figure out how this hopeless production became a hit. Well, of course there are all those kids into zombie movies; but what about the critics? Sadly, many of the critics have the sensibilities of all those kids who bought the tickets. Alas, little Agatha is no more. If only Norman could have directed her to have those knuckleheads (aka 'the critics') give 'Paranorman', the rating it deserved. It looks like Metacritic's completely misguided '72', will remain Paranorman's ultimate final composite rating, for all eternity!t Paranorman cops out by becoming completely sentimental.

0547884591|4.0|I have had the book four a few days and am enjoying it, but am finding some issues with how the material is presented.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Overall I am enjoying the cooking part. I am a serious home cook, but I have found a few tricks in the book (peeling garlic) that have sped up my prep time. I also like how minimal the recipes are, but not minimal in the taste department.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />Some of the recipes seem to be poorly edited and I find myself flipping to the summary to find missing ingredients. For example, on the curried cauliflower, I wondered if it needed some water. It did, but that was only in the shorthand version and not the full recipe or ingredient list.<br /><br />I am not impressed with the meta-learning portions of the book. I am very interested in language acquisition and some of the discussion of the language learning process seemed a little too brief. Maybe if it was bulked up with some more online resources for more languages it would help.<br /><br />Overall I would give it 3.5 stars, but since this is Amazon I will give it 4.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Fantastic book that I couldn't put down. Amazing journey of a woman trying to find her place in this world.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|But way better in any case than casting a little squirt like Tom Cruise as Reacher in the movie. :)<br /><br />[One presumes that Lee Child didn't have much influence on the casting and/or the casting director never read any of the books.]<br /><br />My main problem with this Reacher novel (A Wanted Man) is that he spends so much of the book, literally, going along for the ride.

B002C949KE|4.0|This was a fun book to read. It has been a while since I took any economics courses, and I forgot how much of economic theory is based on the assumption that humans are rational beings, always acting in their best interests. Dan Ariely does a marvelous job of shooting holes through that assumption.<br /><br />=== The Good Stuff ===<br /><br />* The book is really an overview of behavioral economics- the study of how supposedly rational people make decisions. Ariely recounts numerous experiments in which people are given a challenge and react in ways which would seem to be exactly opposite of their self-interest.  As an example, if you allow people the chance to buy $1 chocolate bars for 10 cents, they will purchase quite a few. But if you offer then 90 cent chocolates for free, they will only take one or two. If experiments like this interest you, you will enjoy the book.<br /><br />* In each case, Ariely describes a simple experiment, and provides a theory as to what he thinks happened. I have no idea how many of his theories are considered valid, or would stand up to peer review. But for a quick read to just amuse yourself with human nature, the explanations suffice.<br /><br />* Ariely picks a nice assortment of topics-everything from placebos to \\"irrational\\" pricing and honestly and ethics. The experiments are clever and \\"fun\\", although I doubt they would stand up to serious scientific scrutiny. Still, they were fun to read, and I will probably try some of them on my friends.<br /><br />=== The Not So Good Stuff ===<br /><br />* While Ariely writes well, he is not the most engaging author you will read. The text comes across a little dry, and by the final chapters, I was ready for the book to end.<br /><br />* While the experiments, or at least their explanations were no doubt simplified for the book, in some cases they open more questions than they answer. Ariely offers one explanation and theory for the observed results, but makes no attempts to analyze deeper, or provide alternative explanations.<br /><br />* Without seeing more information, it is hard to tell if the experiments and their conclusions are statistically valid. In some cases it seems that they might not be, although given Ariely's background, it would seem he would know enough to assure the experiments validity.<br /><br />* Finally, there is no real theme or common thread through the work. Rather it is more like a series of short lab reports. The result is that the book can become tedious, and that it is tough to remember some of the results, as all the stories blur together.<br /><br />===Summary===<br /><br />While there were some problems, I did enjoy the book, and found the material fascinating. Some of the experiments product results that were quite unexpected, and with a little thinking you can use some of this information into whatever your business or trade you operate in.<br /><br />I'd recommend the book, with the caveat that the book has some flaws.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Can't wait for the sequel. Want to know what lies ahead for the charcters in the book. Loved the twists and turns the story line took.
1449410243|2.0|I bought for for my cat loving grandson, and then had to go through it with witeout and scissors to make it even reaaonably decent.  I suppose if I were a regular follower of the authorI might have known, but it never crossed my mind that a book aimed at cat lovers would be X rated.  The language was gratuitously bad, putting in foul language where it was totally unnecessary.  Some of the topics were just plain adult materials, and there was even a graphic I would only expect to see on the wall of a men's room stall.  Some of the comics were funny, but many were hust ho-hum.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I originally had the complete box series of Years 1-5, and like a moron sent my Year 1 to Netflix on accident. A year later and they have yet to return it. Anyway, this two disk version is pretty awesome in that it offers more special features than the original one I had did, and my bluray player will actually play this version (as it doesn't like certain dvd discs.)
B008G12ERC|5.0|This may be my favorite Muse album to date. I have given it multiple listens and I am liking it more and more with each sitting. The current rock genre severely lacks in quality and originality. The Muse is able to hold its own, stay relevant, and make epic albums in a music scene inundated with lack luster and drab emo/indie rock bands. This album really starts strong and ends with some decent Muse balladish songs. This album is a must for any real fan of epic rock.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I read the Huffington Post Parent section every day.  It's great on my phone, kindle or online.  Very happy with this app.
B007V65R54|3.0|Basically, the author says that analysis of the underlying facts beats gut-feel.  Seems like a lot of writing to make that point.
0316019984|5.0|I was so surprised by the quality of this book. I purchased it as a gift and was unsure of what to expect. When I received it I was shocked to find a complicated intricately detailed book. Forget the pop up books of the past! This was incredible. After I got it I showed it to numerous adults who thought it was really neat. I actually purchased it for my nephew. It is his favorite book now. Love it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The fist prompted me to the second.  Then the story started to flow.  A slow start, with a lot of background stuff, but a surprise ending.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It may have been nothing more than my expectations were too high. I usually enjoy Seth Macfarlane's humor but this movie seemed like it was more interested in shock value. I'm not adverse to vulgar humor but all in all I just did not find this movie that funny.
B00304RMFE|2.0|I've never played the Halo series of games.  If I had I might have enjoyed this movie.  I prefer sci-fi over all other movies and books but this one isn't for me.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We got this collection for my kids and they have enjoyed numerous times already. Such a great movie. Great price and delivery was flawless.

1567184855|5.0|[[ASIN:1567184855 Journey of Souls: Case Studies  Life Between Lives]]I was involve in and studied many books in Scientology and I had many hours of auditing mainly revisiting more than hundreds of my  past lives as well as my spiritual journey between lives and experiencing coming into mother's womb etc. , Despite all my effort and a lot of studies; still had too many unanswered questions. I came across the name of this book while studying and reading other books for self improvement and I read more than 130 pages on the first night I received it, having too much past life experience in Scientology auditing this book was making a lot of sense and start to answer most of my questions regarding destiny of souls, and mainly emphasized  on my belief of the existence of too many gods , I find this book very interesting and yellow marked most of the pages, I strongly believe in existence of life after life as well as journey of souls and basic foundation of spirituality which is : basic purpose of our lives is: growth in our consciousness and the idea of this world is a classroom and adversities and  difficult situations are lessons designed for our growth. means everything happens for a reason, and I love the statement michael Newton made\\" the world is imperfect since the creators are imperfect and the basic learning tool of this world is pain!  I very much recommend this book to everyone looking for an answer to know the creator or GOD.
B0052U59F4|2.0|Good story, but those \\"oh mys\\" gotta go.  One or two scattered in the story wouldn't have made reading so irksome.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|a lot of fun and was not over in a second it actually took some time to finish unlike other games I have played
B008GVD6D8|4.0|A fairly good read, a little similar to the &#34;Shades of Grey &#34; trilogy, but nevertheless worth reading ( would have been disappointed had I paid upwards of $25 for this book
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Although this theme can never be realistic, this one gets much closer.  This was the best story line of any of the previous batman movies and I think better than the &#34;The Dark Night&#34; as well.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I have played most fps games for kindle and Android devices and this has to be the best by far.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This series has been transformed from a monster/comedy to a well thought out time travel paradox theme.  While I have enjoyed all the new Doctor Who series, the writing has reached a new level in Season 6.  The 2-part episodes match a Hollywood production - Highly recommend - Note that the series is better if you have seen the past series.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is very fun.... The cons: the stuff that you buy with coins shouldn't cost as much as they do.
B001XUPF2O|4.0|I liked this movie but thought that it was a little too graphic, making it inappropriate for kids.  I also thought the realism captured in Batman Begins was lost and this was more like a standard super hero movie.  Good action and lots of high points, still a good movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked this book and found the analysis that the author used back his claims were very good and convincing.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoy this game so far. I usually play these types of games on my computer. It is nice to take it. on. the road.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I laughed all through this book and would certainly read another by this author. Mira Lyn Kelly is a really good writer
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was full of action and romance, you're constantly trying to figure out the next plot which was always full of true twists and turns. What the 'gamekeepers' next moves were going to be in order to keep control of the game... in the end though we're left to look for the first page of the next book, hope the whole series continued the same pace.

B009MF5BXK|1.0|This product arrived as a Memorex DVD-R--obviously a pirated copy of the movie, in a plain white sleeve, no identification on the sleeve as to what the DVD was.  Have no idea whether it was a good copy or not--never watched it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Free and fun, what could be better?  The birds are angry, it's everything I expected, and anyway, those pigs had it coming!
B00004TS0E|4.0|I meant to order the original movie and got this one by mistake. It's good, but I really wanted the original.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The game is totally amazing very satifactory I recommend it to every one who is interested in a strategy game
B007REV4YI|5.0|Still waiting for the release and my receipt of the ordered Blu-ray. Once I see it I'll probably give it a much higher rating based upon all I have heard about it. A request for a review was premature in this case.<br /><br />Post receipt:<br />On of the best Bonds yet. Great music as well. Intense action and great effects. Hate to see \\"M\\" go. Definitely a keeper.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is a game that will keep u busy for a few days try it and beat it I enjoyed it but one u beat it its to easy
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I don't have a full smart phone, so when I go to Facebook on my phone it's not thru an app and therefore somewhat difficult to navigate...

0143038419|5.0|After reading so many negative comments on the book, I just had to write down my own personal view of it. Even though I do understand (to some extent) that part of readers who found it trivial or even irritating, I was flummoxed by the number of those readers. I think we have all missed few important things here.<br /><br />First: the title it self says that it is a ONE woman's search for everything, so those who say that were disappointed and were expecting something more, just haven't read the title till the end. Those who say for this book to be too narcissistic and that it should have given the more overall picture of the happenings (like, why she, for God's sake, just mentioned 9-11 and didn't dedicate at least one chapter whining about it) - we have to understand that our entire literature from modernism to post-modernism deals with identity problems, and so she did - with her own! Would you be angry at Luigi Pirandello's character for simulating his own death and leaving his newly wed wife just because he \\"figured-out\\" it wasn't the thing for him? Or say that Pirandello is a lousy writer (his book is considered one of the most crucial for modern literature, and it deals with the subject in the same way - from the point of view of one person, not entire world).<br /><br />Second: it is not immature, it is the midlife crisis. It is more than normal that people at this age start to reflect on their life and decisions, questioning each one of them. It is the age of parting from the immaturity and stepping into new, more serious stage of our lives. This can happen at twenties, at thirties, forties, and it happens to almost all of us. Gilbert was brave enough to share her crisis with us in her own way, and you cannot judge a person just because you haven't yet been in her shoes. She does it with humor, fear, energy, anger - everything we all feel at some point of our life.<br /><br />Personally, I loved the book, especially the second part of her trying to find outreligion inside her self, and admitting that all of us, at one point of our life feel the urge to experience the divine. Does she understand all secrets of it? Of course not, but she is experiencing it in her own way and explains her feelings in the great manner. I also enjoyed the part in Italy very much, and I see the book as the proof that no matter how hard break-down we might have, we can always pull out from it. And that life is the union of physical and spiritual and that both of them must be experienced.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Fun for a couple min. then the kids and I got bored.  Had to upgrade to the pay version for all options.  Save yourself the trouble and buy the app.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I watch the show, so I decided to read this. It was good enough, but I like the show better
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Played this game for hours on end.  It's my favorite android app. I highly recommend.  Now my wife is addicted
0345803485|4.0|We read it for book club and really liked it! Very unrealistic but that is the purpose of fantasies! Well written!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really liked the book and easily finished it withing just a few days. It was neat to read someone's experience of heaven. I wish that the author would have talked more about what he learned and I also felt that toward the end he began repeating himself over and over again. I felt like I was reading some of the same statements over and over again just reworded. To me the book also stopped rather abruptly.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have watched this movie many times but this book just blows everything out of the water. This book is very insightful and provides a wonderful fantasy escape from daily life. A perfect fantasy and a lovely read.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|If you like good writing and want to be always guessing what is going to happen next then this is the series for you.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I grew up loving this movie and now my daughter can too! She's 16mo old and loves the songs already - clapping along with the music. Nothing better than a Disney classic!
B001O1O71C|1.0|This book is absurd from start and the ending entirely predictable. I recommend saving your money. One and a half thumbs down.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this book but it was not a good read for me.  I kept pushing forward hoping it would get better but it just continued in the same droll way. Interview style writing is okay with me, at least I thought so.  It was more the lack of character development within each interview.  There are plenty of short story Z books out there that have better character development and shorter chapters than World War Z.  I was expecting to really enjoy this book, otherwise I wouldn't have spent my money on it. I like to re-read my Z books but I don't think I will do that with this book.  Bummer.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This third book was an excellent follow through of the story set forth in The Girl with the Dragon Yahoo. The intricacies of plot and characters was engrossing throughout.  A darn good read with s satisfying conclusion. Best read in sequence.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this one was just too predictable.  It was okay, but not as good as the others.
B008EKOO46|3.0|Diamond's The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies? is best considered a personal reflection somewhat informed by the work of genuine anthropologists. Confidence is not boosted by statements such as \\"for nearly all of its six million years of existence, human society ...\\"<br /><br />I'll assume this line was the gift of a clueless blurb writer and that Diamond knows better. You can extend the timeline back perhaps half of this span if you include hominid ancestors; the human societies that Diamond discusses first arose in somewhat recognizable form perhaps 50,000 years ago.<br /><br />And a corrective to the idea of the \\"Diamond\\" thesis. Alfred Crosby laid the groundwork for Diamond in books like \\"The Columbian Exchange\\" and \\"Ecological Imperialism\\" in arguing the importance of ecological history in the conquest  by the West over the New World. Other laid the foundations on the competition of small European states and the advance of weapons technology. Diamond's great accomplishment is as a popularizer. This is a good thing, but don't expect of him the accuracy and care of a specialist.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder tells a tale about a ten-year-old boy with severe facial deformities. August Pullman enters fifth grade at a public school after being home-schooled by his mom.  He immediately becomes the target of bullying of all kinds.  The author does a remarkable job conveying the empathy that gradually builds among some of Auggie's classmates as well as the incredible courage and strength of character Auggie possesses.<br /><br />Without preaching, Wonder explores bullying from perspectives meaningful to middle schoolers.  The ending is remarkable!  This book could be a powerful tool to begin changing attitudes of both bullies and bystanders.  I highly recommend it.
B00402FGE4|5.0|Loved it. The wife and daighter as well. Why do they constantly drop great Sci Fi? Here in Australia we are bombared with crap reality TV shows, whilst decent Sci Fi is largely ignored. It is such a shame. end of rant

B008AK8FHM|5.0|There are no words to express how all inspiring and life changing this book is!  God chose Dr. Alexander for this experience so other scientific minds would have irrefutable evidence that what occured was real. Thx for helping me solidify my faith!

But he has his dads Intel keen eye for analysing the data.<br />This is another must read. I can't wait for the next one to come out........
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I don't think it was funny enough to compete with how vulgar it was. This movie is definitely not for kids.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|Yes, I'm a girl.  Yes, this movie is kind of a chick-flick... well, totally a chick-flick.  That said, I absolutely loved it.  I thought the chemistry between Portman and Kutcher was off the hook and they were absolutely adorable together.  Warmed my heart!!! :)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|If you like those old point and click adventure game, you will love this fans for sure. It's like the next generation pont and click game which integrates puzzles with drawings and really take average of touch screen well.<br />I am more in the group of hardcore games and really picky on games but I highly recommend this game. You won't be disappointed. The graph looks like it might be a kids game but it's not. It requires some skills and thinking to get past stages and there are many stages and secret to be found in the game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Never thought I would get go caught up in a simple game like this.  Everyone is talking about it so I thought ...why not give it a try.  As this is the 1st game that I have played since getting my Kindle I have nothing else to base my review on.  All I know it sure does help pass the time when sitting in a waiting room.....and sometimes it makes me ....well you know ....not want to put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A great game! Can't get enough! No complaints. Feels like there is no need to out money into it. The option is there if you should choose to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is Wow. This book is much more than I expected. Definitely for the mature reader only. Sensual and dangerous together. It has spiced up my bedroom activities, that's for sure. My husband has been pleasantly surprised. After reading this first installment, I had to quickly order book 2 and book 3. My hearts racing just thinking about it. LOL. If I could look flushed, I would at this very moment. But my chocolate complexion doesn't get flushed. Whew! Hot and steamy! LOL
0525478817|4.0|It was interesting to read some of the reviews for The Fault in our Stars; some teenage, but some clearly written by fellow authors who admire Green's work. In fact, this is the first book I have read by John Green. It wasn't a book I'd have picked up to read because in the main, I write cross-genre thrillers, so young adult novels tend to throw me. But it was recommended to me by my sixth-form daughter and, I have to say, I was blown away. Not only was I totally captivated by Hazel as the novel's main character, the subject matter of the plot was so sensitively written, it wouldn't have been hard to convince me that John Green was just a pen name and that Hazel had written it herself. It's not just a hauntingly painful book to read, it is also emotionally daunting. Hazel's raw courage almost left me breathless. The Fault in our Stars will remain my memory for some time to come. Well done, John Green. [...]

0061119725|5.0|I ordered this book for my nephew and for some reason I didn't realize that it was a big book (I think I ordered it quickly in the midst of holiday shopping and didn't really pay attention). Well what a wonderful surprise to find out that it was a big book. My sister says that it is one of his favorite gifts. The large text and pictures keep him engaged and loves it so much that he carries it around the house. He loves to hear the story, turn the pages, and identify what he sees in the pictures. You can never go wrong with an Eric Carle book and I'm grateful that I learned that from now on I have to order him some other big books.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The only problem with Patricia Cornwells Scarpetta books is that they aren't written fast enough.  I've read them all and want more!

B009NPKTN6|1.0|HELP!<br /><br />I was unable to watch the movie in its entirety because it stopped streaming over and over again.  The problem was evidently at the server location as I had no difficulty streaming HD movies from other providers.  This problem happens almost every time I purchase a SD movie from Amazon.Com.  Please consider refunding the charges, otherwise, cancel my account and refund the remaining balance.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Fabulous<br />Book is was amazingly great I am just trying g to read it so hurry up with this minimum word count
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is my new favorite author.  I thought Slammed would be tough to top, but Hopeless is amazing. I finished it in 12 hours.  I marvel at how Hoover reveals this complex story little by little, from multiple perspectives.  Midway through, I thought the plot might venture into \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" territory, and I SO did not want to go there.  Thankfully, the story heads in a different direction, possibly even more shocking.  While the conclusion is stunning, it is also satisfying.  For goodness sake, I wept reading about two people holding pinkies, a gesture that alternately conveys innocence, comfort, admiration, desire, intimacy, and commitment.  If you are waffling about purchasing it, DO IT NOW!
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was gift to my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited  to have received it. She is a huge Twilight fan. She loved it!!!
B009NRO5XE|5.0|This is an album of 13 of Roxy's & Ferry's solo tracks done in the style of the Duke Ellington 20's Jungle Band, & in my opinion it's the album of the year.<br /><br />This is EVERYTHING [[ASIN:B007X4MZSG Joe Jackson's lame Ellington tribute]] wasn't. This truly sounds like 20's Duke. If you're a 20's & early 30's jazz fan, my initial take is this is awesome! (Though I have no clue what Ferry has to do with it other than being the song writer). While there are no DE songs here, stylistically it's very close; even the production values imitate 1920's recordings.<br /><br />As an example of the music, picture Ellington's East St Louis Toodle-oo (DE's original version, not Steely Dan's wonderful cover) with the melody from Love is The Drug. And it TOTALLY works!<br /><br />Really highly recommended & a huge surprise. I don't know if a non Roxy<br />fan would enjoy it as much as I do, but just using my ears I don't<br />recognize 80% of the songs as Roxy anyways as most are so changed.<br />This is miles better than anything I've heard from current revivalists on the indy labels.

B003YHSE7W|5.0|I'm seriously liking what they are doing with Iron man series RD jr. was a perfect for the part of tony stark! this is a perfect example when they stay true to what made the comic characters great. Hollywood needs to stop trying to change what works. it's not broken don't try to fix it!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Very engaging gameplay. Creative puzzles. The characters are cute the<br />environment is pleasant. The graphics are crisp and clean and the motion is smooth. In short it makes me smile and I like it.
B004ULEEY8|3.0|Movie doesn't break any ground in the alien taking over the world action genre, but it is still entertaining none the less with special affects. just don't expect anything deep here & you wont be disappointed.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|Finally nice to tell which movie adaptations are closest to the book. The newest version with Jim Carrey I would think.

B0027MJU00|5.0|A must-read for all. I myself am 12 and will encourage my friend to read this, despite his lack of interest for my recent reads but I know he secretly loves them and he'll love this too. Once again, I'm stuck with that It's-Over?! Feeling that I hate. Gillian Flynn, keep writing awesome books like this!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Just get yourself some popcorn and sit back and enjoy. Clint Eastword never disappoints.<br />The story line is nice and all the characters become old friends.

B000SEI230|4.0|Having seen the movie \\"A Walk To Remember\\" before reading the book, I was very shocked by the many differences. I feel as if the story didn't pick up until Jamie and Landon started dating. I enjoyed the story, but if you really want to enjoy this book, read it before you see the movie. Lastly, it's more than a walk...It's an experience of true love. ENJOY!
B007RKPO84|5.0|Kreator's newest is arguably their best yet! Right up there with Hordes of Chaos and Enemy of God! Thrash Metal at its finest. Don't think twice, pick this up!
0345803485|1.0|Where to begin. How about with the fact that I am surprised she can walk. Poor Ana goes from being a virgin, never being touched, to getting banged roughly three times a day in succession. Sometimes I found myself wondering...how is she not in a wheelchair by now?<br /><br />Which bring me to the sex scenes...that is why you're reading it, right? He begins by taking her virginity, with what he calls \\"vanilla\\" sex, untainted, purely non kinky sex. That sex scene was one I could live with. I expected this book to be dark and erotic, and found neither of the two. It is quite obvious the author has little to no experience in BDSM, as she is writing from an obviously inexperienced point of view. I think to hide her lack of knowledge she made Ana a virgin, leaving the concept new to her. I suppose if you are easily pleased, the sex scenes will seem interesting rather than laughable like they are. He says her name, no he breathes her name. Just hearing her name turns her on. He kisses her and she \\"fists\\" her hand in his hair. I'm surprised the guy isn't bald with all of this \\"fisting\\". Then he touches her nipple, pulls on it. She nearly finds \\"her release\\" then, every single time. Then they have actual sex for about a minute. End of sex scene. If you can get past her referring to her nether regions as her \\"sex\\" or \\"down there\\" without being disgusted, I say go for it.<br /><br />I gave this one star because there was a decent story line that could have reached excellent heights had it been written well. However, it was not. The book was extremely repetitive. Ana meets Christian, he wants her as his submissive, they both begin to fall for each other but refuse to admit it, they're both insecure, they reveal secrets, break up, get back together days later, reveal more secrets all the while being even more insecure, get married, insecurities continue, and get pregnant. A few obstacles, highly unlikely to happen in any form of a real life, are introduced making the story havesome form of a plot other than sex. Oh, did I forget her subconscious and inner goddess? Really, Ana? Her visualizations of these two components to herself were nauseating. Oh, speaking of nauseating, the emails. Throughout these three books, multiple emails are sent back and forth between the two with what I assume is supposed to be flirtation. It was hard to get past the spelling as if they were speaking as high schoolers. Gag.<br /><br />The most disgusting part of these books is the fact that they take place over a span of a few months. If you can get past the lack of imagination, poor writing, and repetitive qualities, read on.
B0089LT8Y6|1.0|Quite possibly Testaments best album. Highly recommended. Album of 2012. Don't think twice, pick this up in a heartbeat! This one is right up there with TFOD, TG, and Low.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|As a fan of Les Mis, I did enjoy this sountrack, especially Anne Hathaway, Aaron Tveit, Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks. However, I am scratching my head as to why it was just &#34;highlights&#34; and not a complete recording of all the songs from the film.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|The previous cover she was using, though pretty and leather, added a lot of bulk and weight.  It got heavy during a long reading session. The MicroShell is very compact and light weight, yet has all the protection needed.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so good. It's extremely easy to follow along and to read just for fun. It's relatiable for teens ,like myself. I enjoyed this book and really fell in love with these characters and story line.

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game was so much fun ! It was especially fun trying to figure out how to get 3 star!!
B006M7JCC2|3.0|Her brief glimpse of eternity gave Anita a worthwhile and life-changing experience. However, l feel she has made a lot of self assumptions for the world as a whole, as if she saw and felt all there was to experience. I sense this was a very personal and limited encounter. Although beautiful, it was still very personal and limited.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Even though it was predictable, I enjoyed the book very much.I found that the love story was a little unbelievable but other than that a great story.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I bought these as gifts for the hoildays.My friend loved them!Happy I find what I was looking for in one spot,and the price was right.
0061438294|2.0|His points and observations are interesting but the book should not have been this long. Everything is repeated. He'll say the same thing using many different scenarios. Drawn out and full of filler in my opinion. Don't enjoy empty writing.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I thought it was really good book and I normally do not like books I have fell in love with this book series
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|An interesting game, with an entertaining concept. But, it takes too long to try to play it for free. I suggest playing only if you have the money or the time.

B0045XICB2|4.0|I feel like I can only give this 4 stars because of Kristen Stewarts poor acting skills. The product itself is great and I have liked the movies. Any Twilight fan would be glad to have this movie as part of their collection.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent film; however, lousy quality of picture and film kept stopping.  I give the film 5 stars, but Amazon--2 stars
B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing and I would purchase it over and over. I think everyone should own a copy of it.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|Lion King is a clasic. I even it everytime I watch it. If youve never seen it I sugest you do.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|**Caution there are some spoilers in this so read with care**<br /><br />Really? This is what we are left with? A weak lame broken Batman who only has like 45-60min in the movie where we get to enjoy him kicking @ss like the Batman that we know and love. The movie, strictly as a movie, was good, but so many plots were unrealistic, and with the lack of Batman it really wasn't even a Batman movie. The plots dragged out and then of course the writers had a hard time pulling it all together. My other issue is that I like the good guys to win, as hopefully most of us do, so the fact Gotham and Batman got their @sses served to them on a tarnished platter just sucks. Plain out sucks. Terrorists like that just piss me off in general. So watching psychopathic terrorists who are so completely delusional, is just horrible. I don't want to watch that! Anne Hathaway played a nice Catwoman and I was happy to see the character of Catwoman come into the movies finally. Nice suit Anne ;) You kicked butt and had a great body, super kick@ss heels too. But I didn't like that they made her such a hardcore selfish biotch. Its hardly acceptable that she \\"redeamed\\" herself at the end by finally giving a care about someone other than herself. We are to believe that Bruce accepts her after what she did to him? And the illusion we get at the end where Alfred looks over and sees Bruce and Selena together? This movie was just so far out there compared to any other Batman media it drives me nuts. I'd rather watch the Campy 1950s Batman and Robin films than this last of the trilogy. I wish they had gone more into the character of Catwoman, she's one of my faves. I just don't like the hard edge they portrayed. Now regarding \\"Robin\\", I had a sense earlier in the movie that he was the Robin character but its hardly believable that just because he found Bruce's suit and gadgets that he is going to take over now that Bruce is \\"retired\\". I am happy that he survived the blast, I mean he has to! He's Batman! He can't die! But I don't understand why they had to let him stay dead. Why are people not allowed to know he survived? Is it because by now too many people know that Batman is Bruce Wayne? Are we to believe that after all he did, saving millions of lives, they would take him into custody and throw him in jail for being the vigilante they thought he was before? Come on people. Have some gratitude. Anyways, check out the movie, if you haven't and you just read this, sorry for the spoiilers but I warned you. I like to rewatch movies over and over again, but this is NOT a movie I will be watching again. It's too disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptial at 1st but I am now a fan and have read all 3 books. Its an easy enjoyable read but is a bit racy.
0374214913|4.0|\\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" tells the story of Clay Jennon, a former marketing expert and web designer, who has lost his job during the Great Recession.  His climbing ability lands him a job at the eponymous Mr. Penumbra's bookstore, a curious place with several stories of books, few customers, and a hidden mission.  Being the interested, investigative type he is, Clay sets out to unravel the bookstore's secrets, ably aided by his friends, including his best friend (a startup CEO) and his attractive new love interest (a Google program manager).  Of course, Clay's well-intentioned meddling precipitates a crisis, so he and his team must work quickly to avert disaster.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br />This is basically a coming-of-age story with a lot of cool, inventive technology thrown in and some interesting speculation about the role of technology, past, present and future - as well as a quest or two (who doesn't love a good quest?).  I found the technical discussions to be merest bit Google-centric, but it was still a fun read - and would make an especially good gift for members of Gen Y, techno-geeks, and anyone impacted by the Great Recession.  And, of course, anyone who works for Google. Recommended.
B008M721MS|5.0|This app is great. It works properly,and it is very easy to use. I use this app all the time to talk to my uncle and my friends. NOTE: THIS APP WILL NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRES. IT WILL ONLY WORK ON THE KINDLE FIRE HD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books just give such great detail, it almost feels like you are in the hunger games yourself. I just absolutely loved these stories!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great free app that allows you to preview videos on YouTube and then DL them to your device for later viewing, with a very easy to learn interface, allowing to save the files in various format to help control size of file. Plus you can DL just as MP3 file for music to transfer to your listening device. After DL files, there is also built in the app the capability to view or listen to what you have DL. So when you can't hook to the Internet, but have DL the file you still can view at your connivence, such being on a plane flight.<br /><br />Those who remember Napster (now a paid service) will find a similar experience of being able to DL video and music, but in a much more intuitive manner.<br /><br />  I have been in search for a Windows PC and Apple version of this Tubemate app, but have yet to find one as easy to use as this one. If anyone know where one can be DL for the iMac or PC please post a link.
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! These books! They are just amazing. They writing was superb! I can't wait to see all the movies when they come out!

B0088WFZQG|3.0|Ok acting but good action scenes; worth a watch for a home rental. Keep in mind these are not real actors.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. It came in before Christmas and I am sureshe will be very pleased with it.
B008M36ER0|3.0|This movie starts of kinda slow but then picks up towards the middle and turnsnput to be a entertaining movie overall. The story is actually good and the acting is also good.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|This was a christmas gift.  It came in on time and the person who received it as a gift was pleased.
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Poorly implemented and disconnected movie from the characters. Recognizable actors but still cant deliver what is needed for recommending this movie. Save your time elsewhere; basic foundation for this movie is a three way relationship based on drugs.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game.I love 2 draw and its so cool making the character how u like. :) &lt;3. good thing they made this the free app of the day becuz the free verision is only 3 levels.
B008CP92ZO|2.0|This movie went from worst to just plain bad. Even with named actors they could not carry this movie as it needed to be.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|OK so like most pp that get this app I was really hoping it would bring back memories of playing this in elementary school on the old apple computers (with the black screen and green letters)....WRONG!  I did not enjoy this app at all and even though it was free I removed it on the same day.  As other reviews have said it takes up way too much memory to just be there and not be used.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|Sets a good expectation for the second movie with a good character performance and story line. Action scenes are good and your attention is always kept.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I had this on my ipad and was glad when it was the free app of the day for my kindle fire.  It is a creative twist to normal matching games like jewel quest
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Pretty bloody; violent scenes but over all good acting and character development. Worth watching at home. Based on a true story so im sure there has been plenty of Hollywood upgrades
B009JBZH54|5.0|Owned first 2 movies on reg. dvd, since then have a blu-ray. Bought blu-ray box set of whole<br />trilogy for $2.00 more than 1 movie. And Amazon refunded $2.00 because they found it cheaper than<br />my pre-order price!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|tip top music !  Great service, with zero issues. If you dont enjoy this best of Santana CD listen again.
B008476HBM|5.0|This  book is the best ever. It's a classic that can still be related to today. It's absolutely beautiful and bound to be a favorite of whomever reads it.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary is easy and fast to access.  Just type in the word, and the definition, as well as the pronunciation, come up.
B0055SWM08|5.0|You really get a lot of logic-based puzzle for your money... The rules are quite simple and well laid out, and the complexity ramps up at a nice, even pace. Add in the quiet, melancholy music and background graphics and you have one superb game that is easily picked up where you last left it- a great puzzler to add to your collection...
B004BA4E4I|4.0|great dvd but it would appears to be missing the booklet inside the case so not really sure what happened there..
B00AKKS278|5.0|&#34;Life-changing&#34; is not just a catchy phrase to get people to read this, it is a result of reading and applying this! This book has truly impacted my life, helped me see myself, my walk with God, and my biz more clearly. I am very excited to make TMM a part of the rest of my life and to teach it to my wife and children. Thank you Hal for adding value to countless lives.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like this FB version better than the mobile version that I have on my phone. Plus it's FREE!!!  Awesome!

B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is outstanding!  I recommend it everyone I know.  I heard of it in a meeting and what I heard was not my impression.  I never want to eat Wheat or gluten again in my life!  What Dr. Davis writes about is the truth.  My long standing FMS issues have improved, I am more alert and active.  If you were to by any book with the term &#34;wheat belly&#34; buy it from the expert himself.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the 3 books it made me think how I should compromise with my husband on things & enjoyed so much
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I think the title speaks for itself.  Boardwalk Empire is another Great HBO series following The Wire, and the amazing Sopranos.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this for Christmas for my daughter, she love alll the Lego friends series. She asked for Olivia's house and tree house, she is only 4 and she loves legos and building.
B000I9YX06|5.0|I love this movie, bought it for a christmas gift.  The movie arrived before the delivery date, and came probably packaged.  If you like Will Smith and like some Sci-Fi action, this is the movie for you!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Very fun and addicting game. Surprised it's free!  Funny and cute too!  Good for kids and adults! So stop reading and play already!
6305428387|5.0|This is a classic movie! My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed it and the theme of determination was a  great one to have the kids learn!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This novel is a unique blend of horror and charm, a page-turner that delights, instructs, frightens, and comforts.<br />It is a contemporary &#34;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#34; in prose, a story about God and nature as seen through the eyes of Pi, an Indian boy who, like Coleridge's sailor, endures a terrifying ordeal and emerges, through the grace of God and the power of his imagination, full of faith and love.<br /><br />The movie (excellent, too) sent me to the novel, and I am grateful.  Don't be put off by the religious exposition at the beginning; embrace instead the chance to learn about an inclusive spiritual mindset.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This is a fun read if you enjoy Tina Fey's brand of humor.  It also gives you a glimpse into the world of comedy writers and the challenges of mixing a real life with a show business life.  It was an easy and enjoyable experience.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I recommend this app for all the times you are stuck twiddling your thumbs. Make good use of down time by playing this fun game.
B000026KGC|5.0|Great album, great covers. Rod Evans was a real good singer.The shape of things to come by the band that would dominate hard rock in the early to mid 70's!!Recommended.Why in the world they are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is beyond me!!!
1455527475|5.0|This turned out to be a terrific choice as a gift for my son since he is in the same business and he couldn't put it down.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I've been looking for an epic story since I finished the 8th Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. I wanted a story that was as consuming, that would totally engulf my mind as I read. Kvothe's story is a total break from the Outlander world, yet just as thought provoking. I am so thrilled to have another series to love! I was hooked from the first page.
B00005O3VC|5.0|My husband loved it. It's too funny! Well worth the entertainment value. It arrived way ahead of schedule, and in time for Christmas gift giving. It was well packed and arrived in good shape.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Outstanding--Francis McDormand and Bill Murray and Bruce and Edward all deliver over-the-top performances, not to mention the young man and young lady--
B004QOB8SO|5.0|My daughter loved it. Can't get enough of this great series! It arrived way ahead of schedule, and in time for Christmas gift giving. It was well packed and arrived in good shape.
B001FVD65O|5.0|A worthy sequel to the original, DH:WAV has a lot of great NYC stuff like how hot it is in the summer and how most NYers don't really care when a former East German colonel masquerades as a terrorist to commit an intricate heist of gold bars but then John McLane stops him.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|My husband loved it. What can I say, the whole family is a Trekki fan. Have already seen it several times and enjoyed each. It arrived way ahead of schedule, and in time for Christmas gift giving. It was well packed and arrived in good shape.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Well 90 minutes spent with this film. I had heard good things about it, but sadly, I have nothing good to report about it.<br />Not a film I would want to watch again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book.  It  has every thing possible to happen during the story but I find that I was unable to put it down so
0783222149|5.0|This 1994 film starring Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep was decent from start to end. The film is an enjoyable thriller set on a river to which Streep's character's family end up journeying and meet a trio of guys on the way. With some spectacular photography showing some breathtaking views, this film has something for everyone. Law and Order star Benjamin Bratt also pops up in the film.<br />Well worth a watch, and a rewatch!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie is great for little girls. Shows them how to honor tradition as well as be adventurous, inventive and loyal. I was expecting the usual Disney princess story line but this proved to be much, much better. You can grow up to be a woman without having to rely on a man. Who knew.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|The cast of the movie is certainly top notch, but the film itself is not. I enjoyed it but felt that alot more could have been done as the film is fairly dull in places. Jude Law's Australian accent is pretty terrible as well. The film is worth a watch, but a rewatch? No.
B005LAIHZE|3.0|I bought and paid for this Blu-Ray because it was great and it had a Digital Copy. Upon attempting to download it into my iTunes I find that the code is invalid, so my product therefore is incomplete. That is why I gave it a 3 star rating.
0307361012|3.0|I originally read The Bat many years ago after it had been translated into Swedish and after reading later novels by Jo Nesbø, it was fairly easy to see why the publishing order was changed in the UK. Nesbø is not alone in having translated works published in this country in a different order, Sweden's Helene Tursten, Håhan Nesser, Henning Mankell, Camilla Läckberg among others as well as Norwayäs Anne Holt and Karin Fossum all have suffered similar alterations. First novels atre not often the best and for an author to make a decent breakthrough in a country where a translation has been required, it is often wiser for a publisher to allow several stories to be written before selecting the best to start the sereis in the UK.<br />The Bat reminded me alot of my times in Australia and seemed to describe Sydney fairly well, as it was back in the mid 90s anyway.<br />The Bat is a must have for anyone wanting a complete Harry Hole collection, but for others it is maybe one to miss.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game and lots of fun to play with all the different classes. Only thing I didnt like was it kept asking me to give this review and wants to send me emails.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|Three or four stars? I really couldn't decide.<br />Interesting film showing the rise and fall of our only female prime minister. A good all round effort from the cast, although I did not like the scenes with Maggie in later life with Denis. The scenes of her past were far better and worth watching.<br />Strangely I found that time flew by whilst watching this. I found that I learned a few small buts about Maggie's history but nothing major.<br />Could have been better though.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Love watching this movie over and over again! The music is great and the storyline captures the heart of children and adults alike!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Distasteful, disgusting...I felt sad for the female character, that she was so weak as to fall for this man's ideals (if you can call them ideals!)...I only read about 100 pages, and found myself feeling &#34;down&#34; and sad...so I deleted the book from my Kindle!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Than the cord my Kindle Fire came with. We had 2 chargers in the same week go bad after less than a year. This charger is much better and more in line with other products using the USB cord. A little ridiculous to have to buy adapted seperately.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Wonderful movie filled with lots of scenes that are touching without being overly sweet.  Great flick for young girls since the girls are never portrayed as victims but as true individuals with strengths, weaknesses and honest emotions.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore is a book that's simultaneously fun and frustrating, but in the end, the frustration unfortunately starts to win out. The book starts out strong enough, with Sloan's prose reading hypermodern (seriously, there are references to things that just happened months before its publication), and although Clay Jannon is an everyman to his core, he's likable enough, there's a good cast of supporting characters around him that give things some liveliness (even though we don't really get to see below the surface of any of them). Over the first third of the book, we're introduced to the cryptic puzzlebox that is the bookstore: why are these people renting these books, who's paying to keep this bookstore open, and what does it all mean? It's fun to watch the mystery get deeper and more arcane as the story progresses.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the first third, the book should be retitled \\"Mr. Sloan's 150-page Google Love Letter\\". I didn't count how many glowing references to Google were made in the book, but I'd say there were at least a hundred, all of them wondrous \\"Gee, look at what this amazing company can do!\\" references. I don't know if Sloan is angling to get a job in Mountain View because of this book, but the amount of free publicity he gives the company through the book is simply staggering, and really distracting. I applaud him adding some realism to the story by using real-world companies, but the singularly fawning admiration for Google just drags on through the whole book. The second third of the book is more or less \\"let's have Google do it for us! They're great you guys! Have I mentioned how amazing Google is yet?\\".<br /><br />The final third of the book is where all the secrets are revealed...after a few diversions from the plot that felt like padding, we finally get the big revelation, what the whole bookstore was about, what it means, the deeper secrets it holds...and, well, it's really disappointing. For a moment that I guess is supposed to be some huge revelation, the ending is definitely muted and underwhelming.<br /><br />I still gave the book 3 stars because Sloan can write, and his prose isn't going to bore you, nor will the story...both move along at a nice clip and don't say more than they need to for the most part, but there are definitely some 2 star sections in here, as well as some 4 star ones. I'd recommend it as a breezy read (I'm not a terribly fast reader and I finished it in about 3 hours) that does have some good things to say, if you can get around all the Google references.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the best flash game i have ever played! It has a storyline that is very original and the game works extremely well with a touch pad. It is just the right mix of fun and challenging. I'm almost through the first four worlds and it just keeps getting better and better. Very very good game.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|I heard one of her songs on the radio on drive into work one morning, googled her @ work, found & bought this one. I love almost every song on it. Now one of my favorites :)
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|This was a good movie. I had issues with the dvd. It skips and freezes really bad and you miss a lot of the movie.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|very flimsy and cheap manufacturing. The spring system to hold the phone just fell apart the first time used.  Would not recommend this particular brand,
B005LAII0I|5.0|It arrived shortly after ordering it. Works well. No known issues with the dvd whatsoever. Would recommend to any one.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I bought the trilogy to give as a Christmas present...but being the batman fan that I am... I couldn't resist the temptation & kept out for myself! My mother & daughter were visiting so we had three movie nights during the Christmas Holiday. I took a refresher course on the first two movies, Batman Begins & The Dark Knight & my mother hadn't seen Batman Begins. Then we all enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises. Can't wait til the next one comes out! Alfred & Robin by chance? He he
B007MDB6L0|5.0|A wonderful winter episode in Tinker Bell's season-hopping journey through Fairyland. The art, acting, and music are all fabulous and will surely charm any little Pixie who might be living in your house! Highly recommended.
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|Amazon quality was great.<br /><br />Movie could have been OK if they had left out stallone. Horrible. All Stallone does is mumble incomprehensible lines and shoot a revolver by slapping the gun. Lame.
B0074AGVWK|4.0|A very good read. Typical Maeve Binchy story that keeps you entertained until the end. Recommended for all fans of hers.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|This is a great CD. I do however like ceremonials better but these two cds are by far the best I own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of games that are all different for all kinds of personalities.  Better then I expected from a free game.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Reminds me of being young. I love old Disney movies. I love the songs, esp. Everybody wants to be a cat. Plus, I love a good short movie only being 1 hour 19mins. Kid movies now feel too long.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|A \\"must-watch\\" for sure. Set in prohibition-era Virginia and filmed in the countryside outside Atlanta, Ga, this film has it all. Dreamy Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf shine in an epic tale of a bootlegging legend. It has action, violence and a small romantic thread tied in to make it an enthralling story.  I really enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so easy to read, spellbinding page turner!  Highly recommended for any age, it really makes you think about what if.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from this.  Regardless, I got more than I'd anticipated.  This is a wonderful book - a mystery, suspense, horror, thriller and literary fiction rolled up into one wonderful novel.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Can be played with cell comfortably. Graphics great. Story line not over the top but interesting. Story not for under age 12 in my opinion.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book this one was amazing I couldn't put it down I finished it in three days!!!! I loved it!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great installment. Keeps the emotions real and palpable. Sexy, sensual, and suspenseful. Can't wait for the 3rd one! Must read set of books.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|having to cover over the kindle it makes it easier to read in bed as I can hold the kindle with one hand.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|A friend invited me to watch  Love Never Dies at her home after she had seen the stage play of the original Phantom of the Opera and it was a real treat to see the follow up story of the Phantom of the Opera.  This is FABULOUS, the story line, the photography and music are awesome and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone that has seen the original Phantom  of the Opera.
B00867GHS8|5.0|wonderful family movie, 3D was everything it should be. Arrived as stated, nice packaging. Really happy with my purchase. I would recommend this movie.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Not a bad app. I would like to see a few more places on it. We do l I've in a a rural area.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Fantastic movie, my personal favorite, the 3D in the movie was fantastic. Arrived on time, packaged very nice. I would recommend this movie
B007CKNX28|4.0|Blunderbuss - Jack White - One of the Best of 2012    Jack White, former front man of The White Stripes, recently released his highly anticipated debut solo album Blunderbuss. With sounds of The White Stripes still resonating, White does an incredible job of conveying his own sound in this self-produced album. Blunderbuss is a rock n' roll emotional rollercoaster filled with energetic guitar riffs, commanding piano playing, and White's seductive and soulful vocals. Instead of gradually building with every track White brings you up and down throughout the entire album.    READ THE REST OF MY REVIEW AT THE LINK BELOW!    [...]    Stephanie Rose
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Movie arrived on time and was very nicely packaged. Wonderful movie as all the ice age movies. #D was well worth it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was great, one of the funniest I've seen in a while. The humor is definitely similar to Family Guy. If you like the show, you'll love the movie. If that's not your cup of tea, rent The King's Speech or something else that isn't any fun.
B00447G29S|5.0|Arrived really fast, and was packaged really nice. This is a wonderful family movie. No matter what age you are this is a movie you will enjoy.
0061997811|4.0|A fun pop up book for any Harry Potter movie fans. It's sturdy with many little tid bits about the movies and just plain fun.
1423140605|5.0|Like many adults, I read Rick Riordan purely for pleasure and the enjoyment of an entertaining story.  I LOVED the Mark of Athena because it fulfilled all the standard requirements of a mid series book.  Including a twist that left me gasping for air and turning the page to find I must wait for the next installment in this mythological action packed series!
B007SGM084|4.0|This was an interesting read. It's quite literally a pornography book about love and bondage. I think for me this was more of an eye-opener about the world of bondage with a side-bar love story. No matter how prim and proper you think you might be if you read this you're bound to be a little turned on simply because it is brilliantly written. I did not regret reading this one bit although I'm still trying to figure out how they will make this book in to a movie that's able to be shown in regular theaters ;o)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is probably one of my absolute favorite series and one I will definitely reread. Very pleased and I highly recommend it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child that they have written together and separately. This book was MARVELOUS. I literally could not put it down. Unfortunately, I'm greedy and I want more about Pendergast. I would also like more on Constance Green and Dr Felder.
B000SEIKIW|3.0|I was fascinated by the original book and this one just wasn't as good.  As I think back, my main impression was that it was a comparison of Newton and Einstein.  Perhaps I just didn't understand what he was trying to say?
0062213423|3.0|It was good, some thing you want to read if  your a fan, and you can tell they wrote it lol. Got to know them better [= love the pictures.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|One of the best in the batman series with lots of dastardly deeds by a masked villian -  going on, great special effects and soundtrack, a must see.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Quite different from others of this kind, but it really made a lot of since.  A great read anytime.<br />You will be glad you bought it.
B000Q67876|5.0|If you like or even LOVE this movie, this is one of the best version to get. I got this for my husband as a Christmas present and it blew him away. It's a blu-ray and it contains color photos, actors' biographies, trivia, and other behind-the-scenes information a fan of the movie would enjoy, all in a book form incorporated into the packaging. The price was a great bargain and it was like brand new. It was definitely worth it.
0767811070|5.0|had to get it to go with my huge collection of movies of old favorites. The price was great as well!
B008H6GHL0|5.0|I bought it for my son for Christmas. He loves it since he's a HUGE Resident Evil (Games) fan and Leon is his favorite character of all the games. It seems to follow the plotline from the Resident Evil 4 game ,which is one of the best in the series. So if you like the games and the characters, it's a great continuation for that world. It's a Blu-ray edition with a Ultraviolet digital copy, so he can also download it on his laptop to watch anytime he wants. The animation is fantastic.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This can is a lot of fun. I made my dog as my friend and that is who I am looking for.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is also an excellent book.  It can be re-read over and over again.  I saw the movie and it really follower the book
B009FXIICK|4.0|i like the game, it is fun and it is colorful. i like the way my son plays this games it makes him happy to save the animals
B008RA3X5E|5.0|love it I use it every morning. It's a great wake up device, perfect for the kindle fire hd. love the ring tones
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I got this for my Husband for Christmas. He loved it, worth every penny. Would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Led Zeppelin!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great character development. Something different from my normal read-and well worth the hype. Now on to the next addictive book in the series!!
0783231202|5.0|Arrived in only a couple days! Great movie, brand new dvd in original packaging, would recommend to everyone looking for this movie!
0385523912|5.0|I do not typically read nonfiction in my free time. I am all about stories, and I think of nonfiction as good for you but rather dry. Judging by this one, that's a bad assumption.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy was written by an American journalist who interviewed hundreds of North Korean defectors; six of their stories form the backbone of the book, woven together with big-picture background and factual information. The result is a fascinating page-turner, chronicling people's lives in probably the most bizarre country on the planet. As the subtitle states, the six people--four women and two men--followed in the book are regular folks from the city of Chongjin, in the northern part of the country. They all have families, some of them have careers, but all six ultimately make the highly unusual decision to flee to South Korea; one of the many things that surprised me in this book was how few North Koreans defect, and how much trouble the defectors have adjusting to life elsewhere. The two women who were the most well-adjusted in North Korea are the ones who do best in their new lives too.<br /><br />The book is full of fascinating stories of life in North Korea, from the depressing (a South Korean POW who learns to just not talk to anyone, even his own wife and kids, for fear of saying something wrong), to the surprisingly happy (a young couple who take advantage of the complete darkness at night to sneak out together), to the bizarre (a prisoner who bribes a woman to take news of her whereabouts to her family.... by removing her underwear and handing it over). It's a heavy-hitting book, and I was worried that it would be full of starvation and sickness--which is harder for me to read about than violence--but while both are certainly present, they don't overwhelm the book. The bright spot is that we know there's hope for the six defectors, who at least survived to tell their stories.<br /><br />The writing is not what I'd normally look for in a novel--the author's background in journalism is clear--but for nonfiction, it's excellent: informative and engaging, without drawing attention to itself. The facts and narratives are expertly woven together. Demick keeps herself and her opinions out of the book except where they're actually helpful, and does a great job of bringing her subjects to life as individuals: not just victims of their birthplace, but real people with both flaws and strengths. North Korea is an astonishing, appalling place that the outside world knows little about, but this book brings it to life not just as a bundle of statistics and talk about nuclear weapons, but a real place inhabited by real people.<br /><br />In fact, I can't really come up with much to criticize about this book. Well, the title seems a little too.... obvious, until you find out that it comes from a patriotic North Korean song claiming that they have nothing to envy.<br /><br />At any rate, I've already started recommending this book to people and expect to be doing so for some time.

B008RNGCAO|4.0|Great collection of comics making up the first part of this trilogy.  It seems like two issues are missing though.  Several times two issues are referenced.  One being Bane facing Killer Croc and Azrael.  The other being an issue where Riddler is on Venom.  Other than that this was a great first test for my Fire.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It will keep you in suspense.  It will keep drawing you back wanting more.  It was awesome.  This season is highly recommended.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|keeps you guessing. Pretty picky for my tv shows, this one kept me intrigued I'm even watching the second season now!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A WANTED MAN===As usual Lee Child has produced a story that will cause the reader to have a hard time putting this book down.
030746363X|5.0|Listen to on CD by the author.<br />Intense book but worth it even if you get one good idea, I got over a dozen and it saved me from learning many other leasons the hard way. I have also recamended it many times.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this app. Easy to use and very clear on the screen. I don't use it all the time, but when I do, I'm glad I have it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is great. The only improvement needed is the game menu because it doesn't show in full at the bottom of the screen.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I would hate to have been in that blizzard<br /><br />As a fact and I have always liked diary of a wimpy kid
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app. it is a great game. works great and the whole family loves playing with it all the time
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Not expecting a literary masterpiece because the victim was not an author. I was pleasantly surprised at how well thing were presented. A sad but good read.
B002AKPECW|4.0|Interesting sci-fi, new way of experiencing &#34;1st person&#34;, It wasn't super tight as far as the storyline goes, but involved enough to keep you interested.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I think it's easier than cut the rope & just as addicting. I play it more than my kids do.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I love this movie for it's great graphics. GREAT STORY for the entire family to gather and learn more about following your heart and caring for each others feelings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written,clear details.kept me on my toes.never lost interest..I will read this again after the other that follow.much better than the twilight series
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great if you are looking for something fun yet challenging Flow Free is the game for you!  Flow Free is a great head start on thinking for your little ones.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|Excellent concert, I just wish this concert was on a blu-ray instead of a DVD. If it was, I would have given it 5 stars.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love their music! It has some of my favorite songs on it. I got it for a gift for my mom, and my dad even loved it!
0061743526|5.0|What a gift.  I've been captivated by Harper Lee's voice from the first read to the tenth.  The theme of this book rings as true today as when it was written.  My all-time favorite book.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Do not let the teddy bear fool you, this is not for kids. I was a fan of the movie, and can add it to my &#34;once a year&#34; movies along with 300, Hangover, and Bridesmaids etc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book rips at your heart in the first two dozen pages.  I've read it five times and it still carries me away.  The best thriller of the last decade.  Wow!
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!!!  Very intense action throughout the movie,  a must see.  I enjoyed watching on my Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I was semi-let down by the slow beginning after reading before I fall. The characters seemed less developed and left something to be desired. I felt like I didn't get to know Lena like I did Sam in Before I Fall. Overall I cannot wait for Pandemonium.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|My husband had not seen this movie, so I purchased it for Christmas.  It was a god movie, no sex, nudity or bad language.  See good movies can be made without all that trash.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's was good really enjoyed it even though it started a little slow but once it picked up it was awesome
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was a little worried by some of the reviews on this book....the overly protective, jealous boyfriend tantrums, the damaged girl + the damaged boy= a story that's been over-used....frankly I was worried that I wouldn't want to finish the book because it would piss me off.<br /><br />OMG, I loved it!  Read it in less than 24 hours, and honestly the only thing I'm mad about is having to wait until April for the next book. I haven't been this invested in 2 characters since Joss & Braden in On Dublin Street! LOVE THEM!! Jamie McGuire does such a great job writing this that you genuinely ache when you're torn between the reasoning why they should/should not be together....it's heart-wrenching!<br /><br />Buy it, you won't regret it...or at least I wasn't.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It has pretty much all of the words you can think of.  Every person should use this dictionary to look up words.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I recommend this case to anyone who wants to protect their Kindle Fire.  It's light weight with just enough padding.
B009186JYI|3.0|This is OK for a collector perhaps. I watched it once and put it on the shelf.<br />Some of the interviews, the drunken ones, are pathetic. I just rolled past them.<br />Why did they bother restoring these? I guess to make a new film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read. Wish there was another book to add on to the story line. Would highly recommend to other readers.
0307877523|4.0|Great book - lots of good background info and logic to support the points ... very controversial points that I'll need some time to work through.  But compelling for certain.<br /><br />I should mention that the speaker's constant mispronunciation of \\"causal\\" as \\"casual\\" was annoying.  The funniest was when he said \\"casualty\\" rather than \\"causality (chapter 19).
1451695187|5.0|This book is very good for people who are religious and those who are not as much. It appeals to both readers in my opinion. Very profoundly written book concerning a very real experience that this Doctor underwent.<br />I would recommend this book and give to family and friends.
0061992860|5.0|SAS Survival may be small in price and size but delivers a lot of usable info for those who need a quick reference!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book.I'm not going to give you a summary, but I think you'd love it if you love drama and dramatic type stuff. I do feel like given Holder's reputation that he would be a lot less emotional or not really emotional but \\"deep\\" if you get what I mean.But this book is full of treacherous twists and turns that leave you thinking at the very beginning.

030758836X|4.0|There's a lot to like about Gillian Flynn's GONE GIRL.  It's a captivating mystery (did charming Nick have anything to do with the disappearance of his lovely wife Amy?) and a cleverly conceived thriller (there are enough twists and turns to satisfy any fan of the genre).  But what really works - and what makes GONE GIRL a real page turner - is how beautifully Flynn dissects the disintegration of a marriage.  This isn't really a book about Amy's disappearance; in fact, that aspect of the plot becomes fairly moot by the half-way point.  This is a book about what it means to love someone, in all its terrifyingly selfish horror.  It's about what we do to one another in the name of love and happiness.<br /><br />Manhattan-born Amy is gorgeous, rich, and successful, and she admits to playing roles in her relationships with men (she'll be the \\"Cool Girl,\\" since men love Cool Girls - easy-going, fun, never a complainer).  Nick is likable and charismatic, yet he is haunted by his relationship with an angry and deranged father (at first he can't believe pretty Amy loves him; later he can't remember why he ever loved her).  Their marriage is great until they both lose their jobs -- then they leave Manhattan for the pressure cooker of small-town Midwestern life, and nothing is ever quite the same again.  On the morning of their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears.  Nick becomes the primary suspect.  And the reader is left trying to figure out which of these two characters to believe.<br /><br />In the first part of the novel, the narration shifts between Nick's story and Amy's journal entries. Sometimes they both describe the same event, and we get a clear picture of how impossible it is for two people to really understand each other.  These two hurt each other without ever understanding why.  They also both lie . . . repeatedly.  Later in the story, we get a different picture.  At first we sympathize with Amy and grow suspicious of Nick (she's loving and caring; he's sullen and secretive).  Later, we will sympathize with him, and despise her.  By the end, we won't know what to believe or what to think.  Is anyone in the novel telling the truth?<br /><br />The ending of this book has generated quite a bit of controversy, mainly because what ultimately happens is so depressingly awful.  But at the same time, it's difficult to imagine any other ending, outside the Hollywood \\"feel-good\\" kind of thing you would expect from a big-budget movie.  There's nothing \\"feel-good\\" about this book - not the story, not the characters, and certainly not the ending.  This is hard stuff, about people who are psychologically damaged.  It's hard to like either of them.  Near the end, Nick says, \\"So let everyone take sides.  Team Nick, Team Amy.  Turn it into even more of a game: Sell some [*******] T-shirts.\\"  There is no \\"Team Nick\\" and \\"Team Amy\\" here.  You'll find yourself hard-pressed to support either of them by the end.<br /><br />Do I recommend this novel?  Sure - I loved parts of it, even as I was repulsed by other parts.  It's a fascinating read, and Nick and Amy are fascinating, if damaged, people.  It will remind you of Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT (if you've read it, you'll know what I mean), Craig Jones's masterful BLOOD SECRETS (out of print, but well worth the search for a used copy), and the 1981 film BODY HEAT (there's a fine line between passion and betrayal).  But maybe the best comparison is to the 1989 dark comedy, WAR OF THE ROSES.  If GONE GIRL was a comedy (and it's totally not), it would be WAR OF THE ROSES.  By the end of that film, there wasn't much left to laugh about.  By the end of GONE GIRL, you'll wonder if there'll ever be anything to laugh about again.  It's a powerful book.  But it's certainly not an easy read.secretive).  Later, we will sympathize with him, and despise her.  By the end, we won't know what to believe or what to think.

B00APUYN0I|4.0|One of those fun ensemble movies where most of the characters are likable. &#34;Fat Amy&#34; completely steals the show with her one-liners and crazy stage performances. It's kinda like a Glee movie except less random musical numbers.

B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I considered renting this movie while at the Hilton in KCMO.  Their price was $14.99.  THANK GOODNESS I rented it here for $3, because that's about what it was worth.<br /><br />Sorry, I thought it was stupid & couldn't believe I watched it all the way through.  Dumb story line, generally tacky over all.
0064430227|4.0|Harold and his purple crayon captured my imagination when I was little, and I bought three titles in this series hoping it would do the same for my kids.  I think at age 2 and 3.5 they're still a Little young for it, but they do enjoy listening. This book introduces Harold and his magical writing implement, and is a must-have for any child's library.

0689853491|4.0|This is one I missed growing up, and was glad to be introduced to by a Mommy-friend of mine.  The illustrations are charming, the rhyme well constructed and rhythmic (something so often bungled by children's authors, it seems!), and the story is fun. I also appreciate that the pictures feature a father spending fun, imaginative time with his kids.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Total Recall 2012 is a better film than I was expecting but doesn't really add anything to the original to justify the remake. They've tried to update the story line and in the process lost much of what worked the first time around.<br /><br />There are numerous nods to the Arnie classic which make no sense if you haven't seen the original (the triply-endowed woman is thrown in for no reason whatsoever). They combine the characters of Quaid's wife and Richter, which is a real shame, and lose all references to Mars and mutants so this is a really sanitized rethink that looks more like a sequel to iRobot. Kuato is missing, Johnny Cab is long gone and strangely the glitching mask scene is handled really badly compared with the first time around.<br /><br />The special effects are good and the production design owes a huge debt to Blade Runner's Asian influences. I was impressed with how the fight sequences use the vertical space in the sets which was exciting to see despite some over the top camera moves. Kate Beckinsdale isn't really a good replacement for Michael Ironside and Colin Farrell can't really compare to the uber persona of early 90s Arnie.<br /><br />This remake wasn't the cataclysm I expected but by replacing the campy mutants and inter-planetary intrigue with bland CG and robot soldiers, it feels very neutral and sedated. The original was the last great rubber effects film - it's a shame they didn't pay homage with some great animatronics rather than giving the three-breasted girl five seconds of screen time.

0618918248|3.0|I have read all Richard Dawkins' books except his most recent one, and have consistently been impressed by the clarity, elegance and wit of his writings. When reading \\"The God Delusion\\" I was greatly impressed by his trenchant criticism of religious dogma and fundamentalism, and was initially inclined to give the book five stars.<br /><br />I do, however, have two deep reservations.<br /><br />First, I wish he could have taken a more reasonable stance on what one could call 'moderate' religious belief - the kind that does not seek to impose itself on others, but just quietly gets on with the advocacy of the New Testament as a guide to living. Whilst I strongly agree with Dawkins that it is nonsense to hold that one must be religious in order to be good, I know many people for whom religious belief is just one more reason for trying to be decent towards other people, rather than the primary one.<br /><br />My second criticism is his abject failure to practice what he preaches. Here is a section from Chapter 8, in which he expresses admiration for someone who has the intellectual integrity to change his mind when presented with evidence:<br /><br />\\"I have previously told the story of a respected elder statesman of the Zoology Department at Oxford when I was an undergraduate. For years he had passionately believed, and taught, that the Golgi Apparatus (a microscopic feature of the interior of cells) was not real: an artefact, an illusion. Every Monday afternoon it was the custom for the whole department to listen to a research talk by a visiting lecturer. One Monday, the visitor was an American cell biologist who presented completely convincing evidence that the Golgi Apparatus was real. At the end of the lecture, the old man strode to the front of the hall, shook the American by the hand and said -- with passion -- 'My dear fellow, I wish to thank you. I have been wrong these fifteen years.' We clapped our hands red. No fundamentalist would ever say that. In practice, not all scientists would. But all scientists pay lip service to it as an ideal -- unlike, say, politicians who would probably condemn it as flip-flopping. The memory of the incident I have described still brings a lump to my throat.\\"<br /><br />All this is magnificent stuff. Yet later in the same chapter, Dawkins uncritically accepts the media-peddled account of the attacks on the World Trade Center, using it as a stick to beat religion:<br /><br />\\"Only religious faith is a strong enough force to motivate such utter madness in otherwise sane and decent people. Once again, Sam Harris put the point with percipient bluntness, taking the example of the Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (who had nothing to do with the London bombings, by the way). Why would anyone want to destroy the World Trade Center and everybody in it? To call bin Laden 'evil' is to evade our responsibility to give a proper answer to such an important question.\\"<br /><br />I have to admit that I naively accepted the official explanation until I read \\"The New Pearl Harbor\\" by David Ray Griffin. In this and in his later books, Griffin presents what is now overwhelming evidence that the official explanation is false from top to bottom. Griffin himself had earlier accepted the official explanation until colleagues drew his attention to serious anomalies, but the more he dug, the clearer it became to him that 911 was an \\"inside job\\", with the motive of providing political support for the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.<br /><br />For those who haven't time to read books, the DVDs put out by Architects and Engineers for 911 Truth (available on Amazon), present powerful visual evidence for the explosive demolition of the Twin Towers. In another DVD, physicist David Chandler analyses the collapse of World Trade Center 7. In this he shows conclusively that for two seconds at least, the building was in free-fall, proving that it was encountering zero resistance - a hallmark of controlled demolition.<br /><br />In his uncritical failure to look at the evidence, Dawkins appears to be guilty of the same closed-mindedness as his Oxford lecturer. It is therefore particularly ironic that Griffin is a retired Professor of the Philosophy of Religion. In his willingness to go where the evidence leads -- no matter how disturbing -- he is giving Dawkins a lesson in the scientific method. It is a tragedy for Dawkins that he lays himself open to such a charge. I can only hope that before he departs this earth, he summons the courage to do what a scientist should do -- look at the evidence.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|Coming from a first-time listener to Lana Del Rey, I can say that I really like this EP. The music is gorgeously produced and the lyrics are strong in the most dark way possible, which is somewhat surprising when coming from someone so beautiful. The only major issue I have is that all the songs are like that, and there isn't anything upbeat to make your day better after listening to the downers, and by the last two songs, you're ready to be done. I understand that's who Lana is as an artist, but the lack of variety may be off-putting for some consumers.  Still, I would recommend you give it a listen!

1594487154|5.0|Having been a huge fan of Dan Pink's -  based on the simple fact that his books [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]] and [[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]] literally changed my professional life - I signed up to get an early review copy of To Sell is Human.<br /><br />Much to my dismay, the title had the word \\"sales\\" in it. Yuck. Disgusting. Sales.<br /><br />This had been bound to happen, I figured. Dan had decided to focus on an area of business that I just wasn't interested in. Guess I'll sit this one out.<br /><br />But, just to be fair, I cracked the cover and starting reading just a little.<br /><br />I was intrigued when, nearly immediately, Pink made the case that everyone was in sales, not just those ravenous [[ASIN:0394620496 Glengarry Glen Ross]] animals. He then made a strong case that the world has changed, and that the art of persuading and convincing others is a science comprised of counter-intuitive components. But, these components can be harnessed using modern, research-backed approaches.<br /><br />Pink convinced me, as he always has, by being a great storyteller who happens to have a wicked-entertaining wit. The stories he weaves have pulled in the latest social psychology research (some approved for publication but not even generally available yet).<br />Pink's well-researched stories, clean conceptual models, chiseled prose and workbook-like organization make this book another must-read for anyone who wants to be more effective at their job.<br /><br />\\"But hey, my job is working as a 'Fung-schnoon-wahatcha-hisit', so this book doesn't apply to me,\\" you might be saying. Really? Then you need your head spun like mine was. Do you ever try to get someone to do something? Do you have kids (gulp)? Do you ever present a point of view, try to get funding, go for a raise or promotion, or try to help someone by gently pushing their frame of reference to show them a better way?<br /><br />Well, thought you did.<br /><br />Read this book and learn about attunement, bouyancy, and clarity. These new ABC's of 'moving others' are sure to make you a more effective person. And not the Glengarry Glen Ross kind ... the truly human kind.<br /><br />Well, thought you did.<br /><br />Read this book and learn about attunement, bouyancy, and clarity.

0312641893|5.0|I adore fairy tale retelling. Cinder luckily captured everything that Meyer wanted. It was a very creative and imaginative story. I loved Cinder. I found the cyborg aspect to be interesting and I liked how Meyer included how being a cyborg had pro and cons. I liked that she was strong and decisive. Iko was a fun character and I really liked her. Kai was amazing and I adored him. He was funny and also very persistent. The stepmother and  stepsisters were interesting, more so Peony. Queen Levana was well evil and I can't wait to see what she will do next. I found this plot to be really exciting and I didn't want to stop reading this book. The only issue that I had with this book was that the plot becomes really predictable at a certain point, but even with that I really enjoyed this book. I found this book to be really unique in how it was told. Meyer retold the tale in a matter that didn't sacrifice any of the world that she built. The world was really flawless and I want to know more about it. The lunar people, plague, and Cinder herself interest me and I hope that is addressed in Scarlet.  I am really excited to see where this series goes, especially with how this book ended. I recommend this book to  people that want a really epic book with a great cast of character and an awesome world. If you are lucky, this book will captivate you as much as it did me. I need more.

B005RUUUAI|4.0|Not as good as the first season but still very much worth it.  The zombie apocolypse plays less of a roll in this season by necessity.  Characters are developed instead of mindless zombie blasting, which may put some folks off.  Personally it makes the admittedly sparse moments when zombies to come into play all the more thrilling.

B0092ZEIN4|2.0|I bought this to play emulators like SNES and NES on my Nexus 7.  It works pretty well even without the nkyo app.  Problem is, for SNES, You CAN NOT use the \\"back\\" button to map select.  Well you CAN, but every time you press it, it exits out of the app you are in.  And also, the analog \\"triggers\\" don't even register.  So out of the box, 3 of the buttons that I THOUGHT would be mapable, are useless.  Also those 2 analog sticks?  They just act as additional dpads unless you use nyko's playground app.  Oh and by the way, as soon as I tried using nyko playground my controller went to some buttons not working, to my apps not even being able to FIND the controller any more.  Nyko's app is still in BETA and after using it, it couldn't even scan for the controller.<br /><br />Even though the controller feels nice and is made well, it's completely ruined by the fact that it's not ready for market.  I returned mine and I would urge not to buy one til nyko get's it's act together.  Oh and I wasn't able to get a response from nyko customer support, very slow response.<br /><br />EDIT: I wanted to edit to add that the reason my tablet doesn't even find my controller any more is that 4.2 android is having wifi problems, so that part is not nyko's fault so I upped the review score to 2 stars.  But the fact that 3 buttons are not usable out of the box and that nyko's playground app isn't ready and full of bugs, still deserves noting.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A mysterious ship glides through the outer reaches of the universe.  Where are the crew going and hoping to discover?  This film keeps us guessing what this commercial enterprise is really all about.  It's dark and very creepy and mysterious yet visually stunning with references to mythology and the origins of life. Gorgeous and fascinating in its' telling, nevertheless the final is ambiguous and unsatisfying.
B0030B1WBM|3.0|If you're like ,e you like a good Christmas story like the next guy but this is one of those types of movies to watch once and be done with. Carrey is a good actor and did a god job but I could not stand to watch it again.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a very funny and awesome movie. One of my top of 2012. A great end of year movie. Was very funny and enjoyed it the whole time. A must watch for everyone.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A really enjoyable game that keeps you on your toes and has a lot of replay value, worth every penny.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I enjoyed the relationships between Eastwood's character stubburness and his daughter's.<br /><br />  I liked how the idea of old versus new worked out.  It shows an idea how people still have a role where a computer can't feel or hear experience.  Actually that is about the programmer who doesn't program that in to their program.<br /><br /> I also enjoyed the idea when a person gets older, they tend to hide  their faults fearing rejection or possible loss of something earned, whether its a job, a drivers license or just the ability to take care of one's self.<br /><br />There does seem to be a little too much just sitting around.  It's a movie with a lot of dialogue with other people performing action tasks in the back ground.  The characters do drive down the road some.  So, while it's not an action flick, it's got a lot of dailogue... issues that people come across in their live times packed into a 2 hr movie -- good stuff.<br /><br />It's good flick.  I'd watch it again.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Well worth the $1.99 I spent to purchase it.  Works well on my Kindle Fire.  Thinking about purchasing Mahjong Artifacts 2 as well.
B0000669JL|5.0|Good CD, Bob marley always puts me in a good moood, would like to have more of his CD's.He was a great singer
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would highly recommend this book...I don't know if it is because it hit so close to home with me....but you can never go wrong with a Nicholas Sparks book...this book draws you in from the first page ...a must read
B00000K2W1|5.0|Great CD, very good shape..Brings back a lot of memoties..Love all Janis's music,, can't go wrong! Need to buy more!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game is super fun and I recommend it to anyone who loves strategy games! The only thing keeping it from a 5 out of 5 rating is how hard some modes are,but overall this is a great game!
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Great CD, in great shape,, Love Grace's strong voice, takes me back to the 60's.Can listen to her all day!
B00003CXBH|5.0|This just happens to be one of my favorite movies.  The music is wonderful and Peter DeNero's acting is superb.  I do think they should have some kind of an Oscar for it
B009NPKTN6|3.0|WOW! This movie is a full out musical ...... which I wasn't expecting.  The highlites are the scenes involving Tom Cruise and anything to do with the bar. Bad is the ackward romance with Alec Baldwin and the poorly developed mayor's wife.  It was very obvious that the music was studio recorded and not even attempted at being live.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I stayed up until 2 in the morning to finish Hopeless and all I can say is WOW! After reading Slammed and POR I was an instant Hoover fan. This book was filled so much emotion, twists and turns. I can almost always guess whats about to happen in a book but couldnt keep track of the times I was shocked by Hopeless. This is my number 1 book of 2012.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I think its pointless and strange.  I had a hard time getting through it.  I won't read any more of his books.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Ive watched the whole series now, and  it did seem quite a bit off in the beginning since I was used to the big budget CGI stuff,  I kept watching and realized it was going to hold its own with the story and characters and smaller budget CGI. The departure Cutter early was an annoyance to me, but certainly not enough to stop watching. Its interesting to note that the producers rarely showed any gore, if at all, which may be a part of the BBCs style, and its refreshing  to see this type of genre series moved foreward without the need for bloody scenes. I was intrigued enough to follow on till the end, and I am glad I did as it was good entertainment, and fun to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was something I never expected. It reminds you of hope. It reminds you of life, and to keep living it. To never give up and fight for what you want. I have to say this is the best series I've read so far. I only hope the movies do it justice.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I chose this book to see how Katniss had upset the capitol and what would come of it. I thought this book was ok and sort of a mystery but not that suspenseful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this battery monitor, it tells you the health of your battery as well as the temperature. It shows you what's been using up the life of your battery and it also has a graph that charts your batteries power level througout the day, good job.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book after watching the movie.  To  be honest, I really thought the movie was a little laborious and boring. I wasn't,t going to read the book at all but so many people liked I  I decided to go ahead and read it.  I thought it was a great concept and was well written. Definitely worth the read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoy reading romance books and this was not romantic to me at all.. In my opinion I found it a little disturbing. It was a very interesting book just not what I was expecting to read. I would recommend reading it because the other 2 books of the trilogy are much more romantic than this was and you need to know both of the characters in order to better understand the other books.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony is an excellent game to have for all ages. In the begining its quite easy but as the game progresses it gets harder and more challenging to complete the goals and level up. Get game to have for all ages.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read these books after all of the craze died down a bit but I dont think they were as good as I was expecting.. This one is by far my favorite .. I like Romance books and this one is the most romantic of the 3. I would recommend reading them they are definitely worth the read.
B009MO5960|3.0|It's a great action flick with some larger enemies but this movie is certainly a rehash of previous story elements.  It was fun to see previous stars that I loved in the past movies but at less than 90 minutes, there was not enough story.  When this movie ended the first time I watched it, I jumped up thinking the movie finally started only to see the credits start rolling.  I've been a big fan of the series but unless the next film really conveys the story more, I won't be a repeat buying of the Movie.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book I thought it got much more interesting in this book as a oppose to the first book. I would definitely recommend reading this trilogy. I like Romance books and it starts to become much more romantic in this book!
0684824906|5.0|I am judging this book, not from reading it myself, but as a gift.  I liked the way it was presented in the old style.
0446618322|5.0|As in all of Nicholas Sparks books a fantastic story, well written, hard to put down once you start it.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|fun and easy to play<br />with good instructions quite addictive. Creative for all ages increasing memory.Would try others like it.'RE
0446547654|5.0|Another great book and read by Nicholas Sparks.  Be sure to have some time in you start as you will not want to put it down once you start it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Purchased this app for my kids to play and build together on same server.  That option does not work on my fires with the correct settings.  Amazon support tells me that the version does not support multiplayer, but my friend has the same app on his phone and tablet and multiplayer works fine. Minecraft does not support this app for kindle fires. Great game for the kids if it works, but if you have a problem....good luck.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I felt like I couldn't put the book down.  Glad I chose this book as my first kindle fire book what a great read on a terrific reader.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Truly Inspirational book. Would highly recommend for everyone. Puts a whole new perspective on heaven and what possibly awaits us once we leave this earth.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Very good, I definitely recommend it. Found my new favorite author. Check out her other book Hopeless, that one was amazing too!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its worth playing. ive watched the tv show on youtube and fell inlove  with the charaters its so cute and the game is so much fun.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|If the crude language doesn't bother you, it is a very good movie!  It is very well done.  I enjoyed it!
B008KWHM6U|4.0|This CD really provides Two Door Cinema Club a chance to show their musical style.  I wanted to hear more of their songs besides &#34;&#34;Sleeps Alone and this album delivers their unique sound.
0547884591|3.0|If you have read the 4 hour workout and the 4 workweek, then you have read this book....It is a mixture of the two books in one book.  I skipped through half of the parts because I had already read them.
B005ERWUKC|5.0|I can listen to this album from start to finish. Each song brings out different emotions and each song takes you to a difference place. I keep this album in my car and I believe that it is one of the reasons why I was able to keep sane throughout nursing school. Cheesy, but hey I think it worked! It's truly magical.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It is a fun little game. Friends were telling me about it a while back and they were right. Great for the subway rides.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|The regular DVD does not contain the additional footage (Dance sequences by Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer). I was told today by someone that only the Blue Ray combo pack version has this. THIS IS NOT CLEAR IN ANY OF THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS PUT OUT BY AMAZON.COM. Since I saw the film in the theatre, I would not have purchased this DVD, but I wanted to see the dance footage that Soderbergh did not include in the film.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Good special effects.  Provides a good background for the Aliens series.  The characters needed to be developed a little more.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|Excellent movie for both kids and adults. My 6 and 3 year old love it. Definite must have for your movie library.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a fast read, a page turner for sure. I only gave it 4 stars because I expected a more dramatic end after the giant build up.  However, I really enjoyed this book.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|My son in law was absolutely, completely, phenomenally, terrifically, wonderfully, especially (there, 6 more words) thrilled to receive this CD for a Christmas gift.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is great! Perfect for little notes, ideas, to do lists, and integrate it with different types of media such as a recording, pictures, etc. I love it and it's so easy to learn to use.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|good game but way to short. not worth 2.99 to keep playing once I got hooked with trial. beat in about a couple hrs.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this for my Canon T2i and the extra lenses and other camera accessories, it has held up great over the past 2 years.  The outer construction of the bag is sturdy and thick and the inner compartments are fabric and can be adjusted easily because they are all held together by velcro.  I frequently take the bag to family events and picnics, it is great to wear like a backpack, it can fit strapped tightly with the additional front clips, so its not constantly slipping off your shoulders.  I have not dropped the bag with the camera in it, and the bag makes no claims to protect the camera in that event. but IF I did drop the bag from a few feet I think ti would at least reduce the damage if not eliminate it.  I have had several people ask me where I got the bag, and most are shocked to hear that it is from amazon, it looks great, and a amateur photographer can not go wrong.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|TEAM OF RIVALS<br />It was a great historical novel. I wanted to understand that period of history better. Not finished yet.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Take a game that looks like it belongs on your Atari 2600 console, put it in 3 dimensions, then slap it on a tablet. You get Edge Entended. You may think, so what? The &#34;what&#34; is that it's also extremely addictive. You are required to move a cube by rolling it on its sides, which carries it through a variety of obstacles. You'll be required to cause your cube to climb, activate switches, moving walls and steps, and more..<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun with such a simple game since I was introduced to Tetris. Good work on this one!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Best Grisham book yet...I've read it twice.  They need to make it into a movie with Denzel Washington playing the lead role.  Awesome!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book. I wish everyone would read the perks of being a wallflower..... all I have left to say is there are some unforgettable, loveable, and beautiful perks to being a wallflower.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'd heard mixed reviews of this book, but I loved it.  Could barely put it down. Very very good book.
B00008G8LG|5.0|I ordered this movie for my cousin for Christmas. It arrived on time & in excellent condition. The price is excellent & they enjoyed it? Ordering was easy.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|great movie I have watched it a dozen times a great compliment to our library. I would like to purchase the original
B000641D2Y|5.0|My favorite out of the Home Alone series.  In fact, never had the desire to watch 3 or 4.  Number one was good also, but love the second one a bit more.  Excellent for Christmas time.  DVD was sent quickly and in good condition.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|The game is entertaining. It runs smooth on my gs3. Great story line and I love the fact you get to draw your own stick characters.
B000V6738U|5.0|An excellent collection. Very seldom is this music played on radio stations. I heard one song recently and then purchased this collection. Very enjoyable.
0307279189|5.0|SUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN THIS IS IT AND DO IT WELL BUY THIS ITEM! 19 WORDS TO FILL THE REVIEW WOOT! WOOT!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is hard to argue with Eben Alexander's medical credentials. More than anyone involved in his experience, he understands the medical condition his brain was in and its inability to fabricate the things he experienced. That is what makes this so compelling.  Knowing that what he experienced actually happened to him (as it will to all of us) while being able to discount any influence his physical condition may  have had is a powerful argument. Sending a teacher into space may have had value for students. Sending a doctor and a scientist forward into the next step beyond our physical life here and allowing him to return to share it: priceless.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Enjoyed it. Ending was a bit of a letdown though.  Worth taking a few hours out of your day for sure!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I guess they forgot how to write. There were a lot of weird pauses that lasted forever. The movie just doesn't ever really go anywhere. I got bored and turned it off.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yes couldn't put it down. On to the third one. Can't wait to see what happens next. Great like the first one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story! I was hooked immediately. I found myself reading way past midnight. The Holder & Sky story will suck you in. A definite must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished it in less than a day because it was that absorbing!<br />A true start to an even better series.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a great read. Very informative on what these great soldiers go through and how they train. Thanks for the men and women that risk their life's for us.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|What a unique sound - rock, bluegrass and folk combined into one. Great lyrics and high-energy songs. These guys would be AWESOME to hear live!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|i want more val morghoris and history of the undead. i just can't wait for the sequel thank you for a great series grrm
B0038BBA4I|5.0|What a unique sound - rock, bluegrass and folk combined into one. Amazing lyrics and high-energy songs. These guys would be AWESOME to hear live!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I think you would like this app because  you can look at pet pictures and tells you the weather love it
B009FZHYKU|4.0|but refuse to pay for cable because I only have a few shows that I like. I would give it five stars, except the characters keep doing things that I think are stupid and then end up fighting for their lives...LOL. Yeah, I'm hooked.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much! and this game is soo addicting and I play it so much love it
B00A757EFW|4.0|Really enjoy this game. Hopr the grand children will enjoy t too. Just have to wait and see what happens.
B00914JWSW|1.0|We all love, Babs--yah-dah-yah-dah-y<br />ah-dah! But this album is probably the worst our beloved songstress has ever released.  It is the kind of dud that saddens the soul, diminishes the star somewhat, and makes you wonder what motivates this kind of Titani<br />c.  There really isn't one selection that isn't flawed in some major way whether it be simply inane lyri<br />cs, or banshee wails that make the ears bleed.  And why a nice little Jewish girl is singing about How Are Things in Glockammorha with her heavy Brooklyn accent I will never know.<br />...not kitchsy kids, just itchy....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. Always have, always will. It's one of my favorite series. 5 stars is what this book truthfully deserves.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm so glad I found this. As a writer I find the graphic novel beautifully written. It tackles all the raw parts of humanity I long to touch when I create my own work.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L James does it again this book is amazing. Could not put it down. Pure genius but what else to be expected from such a literary genius
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of Kings better books.  I like how he ties in IT. Doesn't ramble like some of his earlier books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the greatest game I have ever played. I suggest getting this game. get this game and then play it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop was a great find. I wasn't actually looking for a remote desktop app when I found it. It works great and was very easily set up.
B000SEI230|5.0|This is an awesome book.  I really enjoyed reading it and I will truly recommend it to a friend.  Great Book!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have this app on my phone and it is so much easier to use with the larger screen on my Kindle! LOVE IT!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was an extremely enjoyable, highly entertaining, quick read. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am not crazy about this book.  It takes too long to get into the story line.  I will not be buying anymore in this series.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Good graphics. Quite simple. You can't turn on kindle&reg; fire though. There is no instructions on how to play, I.e: how to use power-ups, how to shoot them when they jump on the car, etc. etc. Unless you have hours upon hours of free time or you are willing to pay actual money for upgrades and such this isn't the game for you. I wouldn't recommend this game for the Kindle. If they made a version for the Kindle, I would give it 5 out of 5 stars.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Had fun with the first one and the second one doesn't disappoint either. You can change settings to make play more difficult if you wish or leave it as it comes and have easy gameplay.
1451696191|3.0|Okay, I'm going to start off saying this: I may say some things that offend your opinion or P.O.V, and I'm sorry. There is no other way for me to explain why I rated this book 3 stars, without criticizing it. I admit, it will be hard for me to do this too. I will not, however, harp on all the negative things and leave out the positive ones. That would be unfair of me. But let's get to this!<br /><br />So, The Perks of Being a Wallflower. This almost turned into a DNF, because I was so depressed in the middle of the book. How could I not be? I felt like Charlie kept talking about his deceased aunt Helen all the time, and everything else that was going on in his life. Then, I started feeling bad! I felt that I should have loved and adored this book like everyone else, but I couldn't. I couldn't fake my feelings about this.<br /><br />Charlie was an odd character. I still don't know whether I liked him or not. He's a freshman, who hangs out with juniors and seniors. That seemed unrealistic to me, but I won't get into that. Charlie is a wallflower, and an intellectual one at that. And this is where my feelings for him waver; he seemed too smart and knowing for his age! How is that realistic?<br /><br />Ok, here come my two favorite characters: Patrick and Sam. I absolutely loved them. They were fantastically written, and seemed real! Maybe I loved them because I actually know what they look like in the movie...<br /><br />The last negative thing I will say is how the mood of the story really, really affected me and my progress on this book. I was confused and sad almost the whole time.<br /><br />Okay, now onto positive things! In the second half of the book, I started liking the story a whole lot better because happiness seemed like it entered the atmosphere. I started reading the book faster because I felt better as a reader. I also really liked Bill, Charlie's English teacher. While he kept giving him books to do essay's on, you learn that he really thinks Charlie isvery smart.<br /><br />I loved Charlie's, Sam's and Patrick's relationship. They were so close, almost like sibling's. If that relationship didn't exist, I wouldn't be able to cope with this book.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't loathe The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I semi-liked it. It just wasn't the book for me, but I still would recommend everyone to read this, since it is a must-read book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics are an amazing quality and the game play is wonderful if you enjoy hidden puzzle games. Highly recommend though it does take up quite a bit if space.You do need to upgrade partway through the game to finish the story though.
1594745692|3.0|I love zombie stuff and this was a natural impulse buy for me. The cards are nice, the accompanying booklet was nice. The cards themselves were funny and the major arcana was creative and well done. The other cards were... ok. Not as much creativity in many of them, even though several were good for a chuckle. I hoped for a bit more variety. All in all it was a fun buy that I don't regret, just wish I could have enjoyed a bit more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Story was spell binding and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I can not wait to read the next book.<br /><br />Uhh
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I can't get enough of Kevin's books! The sense of humor must match mine perfectly because I laugh and smile the whole way through. Now, if only I can learn how to mind-talk to my dog...
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's so much fun to play this game! You have to really remember though! It is still a lot of fun! My favorite animal is a hippo and I just got one so yay!
B007SSEBCU|4.0|I really liked the movie.  I think that Streep is possibly one of the best actresses in the business.  i did not like the particular choice of storytelling (a mechanism thing - using flashbacks to tell the story while tying it to the character's current wrestle with dementia). There was considerable debate as  to whether the current portrayal was an accurate one. I think i would have enjoyed a different story mechanic.  The mechanic notwithstanding, a very engaging (and in its own way, moving) story.<br /><br />Streep is clearly the reason this story is so powerful.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I live when books take me to places unexpected and that is just what Howl did! Jones' style is quick and practical, but her characters are extremely real to me.
B001JU4S44|2.0|Over the top action, movie went too long for the story being told.  On the list of movies I will watch only once.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This a good book with no filthy language.<br />I recommend it to all from teens up.<br />This book holds your interest from the start.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Another good story from Pixar.  Very enjoyable, good story and ending.  Will eventually purchase and own it for multiple viewings.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This is a great game good graphics good fighting be awesome if we're multiplayer 3 players per room so they could help u on missions and so u could go against each other to see who is best
0743270754|5.0|For anyone who enjoys History, they will love reading this book by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  It is a NY Times best seller and the book on which the movie Lincoln is based.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I am enjoying this author's stories that reach back into time of the lives that were changed by World War Two.  I am enjoying this story and have not finished it, but can hardly put it down.  So I have to go now....
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Not quite what I expected. So much story crammed in one small book. Could have been more detailed but good basic story line. Had a hard time staying focused because it was a pretty far fetched tale.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Great movie to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson at his best in this spellbinder.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What a long book keep my daughter in it for three hours  best for traveling  would let all 4 of my girls read
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good way to pass the time.  Haven't had any issues with the games but it did lock up on me once.  I just rebooted and everything was fine.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I love Grisham but for me this was just an OK read - good but for me not the usual Grisham great
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this on a lark and after reading some of the reviews.  I was not disappointed.  I have become a big fan of Mr. Howey's writing and looking forward to reading his other stories.  I read that this might be developed into a movie and I hope that is the case.  Can't help but feel it deserves every recognition.  I am going to read the prequels next and the Molly Fyde stories after that.  Keep up the wonderful writing Mr. Howey.  You are very talented.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He loved the movie and has watched it 2 or 3 times. Would recommend it to anyone that likes this type of movies.
0545265355|3.0|Everyone is faimiliar with the hunger games so the only thing to rate is delivery which was as expected, and the books and packaging which were of good quality. The content of the books is very much a personal taste issue. These were bought as a gift and well received by the person I bought them for.
0345472322|5.0|I had not known that there was such a thing as &#34;Growth Mindset&#34; and &#34;Fixed Mindset&#34;,<br /> And it explains a lot about how people think and relate to each other.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|my family watched downton abbey seasons 1 and 2 over and over again  because like so many, we can not get enough of it<br />can hardly wait for season 3 to start and on PRIME instant video
B009VB97EY|2.0|I've seen &#34;The Thunder Down Under&#34; and the &#34;Chippendales&#34; in years past and thought they were good dance reviews, and fun.<br /><br />I thought the movie was going to be fun and entertaining.  There was little review dancing, a lot of single dancing (where I could tell there was a stand-in), a lot of crotch grabbing and the story was pretty sad.<br /><br />A much better movie is &#34;Dear John&#34;, which could have turned dark in a number of places, but didn't.  I was surprisingly pleased with THAT movie.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Very nice to read the complete set. There are tie ins with previous stories.<br /><br />An aside: Currently a TV program named &#34;Elementary&#34; is complimentary.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love it so much I am only a kid by the way you should toatally get it its awesome
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It,s o.k.  My granddaughter wanted to play it she enjoyed it but it's not what I would play it we'll keep it for her
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|I thought this movie was great for family night at my home. My kids really got into the movie and I thought the movie was fun. I waited for a while to get this movie at the great price I brought it for. It was worth it to me and my family.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Entertaining, funny and oh so cute with these Chihuahuas!  If you loved the first two, you have to see the third!  The puppies just get cuter!
B000YHG72E|4.0|I like this movie a lot.  I was in between rating it a 4 and a 5, but went with the 4 because it's not one of my all-time favorite movies.  It is very funny, though, and sweet.  My husband and I are in our 20s and watched it on Christmas this year together : )
B006O3MU96|4.0|I got this as a FAOTD a couple weeks ago I think, so I didn't waste my money on this. Butttt.... I'm not quite sure it would actually be worth it to pay money for it. I mean, yes it is super cute and Christmas themes which is really great but the original Doodle Jump does have a Christmas theme. But hey if you want the complete Christmas theme and stuff :) then I would say it's worth it! :) Oh and also Doodle Jump on the Kindle Fire is not the best but hey it's a classic! (for me at least ;D ) Haha well overall I say only get it if you want to go all out for Christmas then go for it!!! It is a good game:)
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Disney makes great movies that appeal to adults and kids love. Even if you don't have kids this is a great movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game in the app store it is very worth the 6.99 best game ever it should cost more then what it is
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This low brow humor seems popular. Unfortunately it is not my style. Just listening from the other room it reminded me of family guy. My son had been asking to see this, but even he could not finish it.
B003JRD5JO|4.0|Having always enjoyed Bon Jovi this was a great addition to my collection.  Purchased this as an MP3 easy to download to my media files and sounds great
B00574P9EQ|4.0|This one dealt with sibling relationships. It is a good family movie. It is funny with a little bit of drama mixed in.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read......... passionate interesting and a book you simply can not put down , I strongly recommend, better than the first
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very impressed by both the entertainment value and the amazing story quality presented thus far in the series. I bought these books a couple days ago and once I started reading,couldn't put them down.  Needless to say, I will eagerly be awaiting future additions to the series!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|LOTS OF GOOD MUSIC ON THIS CD.  IF YOU ARE A STEVEN TYLER FAN YOU WILL ENJOY THIS.  MADE A GOOD CHRISTMAS GIFT.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing and has an unexpected twist. I greatly enjoyed reading it and most definitely would recommend it to a friend!
B003HC8I5M|4.0|While Phil Colllins does not sound African American in no way did he seek to sound like or mimic any of the Motown stars.  He has his own vocal style and that's good enough for me.  You could tell this was a labor of love for PC by him giving his props to Motown.  I think his drumming is outstanding and he took it upon himself to fly in and cover every expense of the original surviving Funk Brothers.  Sadly this is the last album for the great bassist Bob Babbitt who passed away recently from brain cancer.  He played a FAT bass and he still had it when he played on this album.  Chank and Eddie also sounded no different when they played on this album as well.  I think this album stands alone in it's tribute by PC to the music that he loved so much and influenced him.  If PC is still is retired from the business I believe he went out in style.
034580404X|4.0|This trilogy was good. There was a little suspense,could've been more. I enjoyed it for the most part. Narration was one sided. Until the last book of the trilogy.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Bought this for my son, digitally remastered music from the eighties. Takes me back to high school, when I was young
141694737X|3.0|Maybe it was the excitement of the day, but she wasn't overjoyed with it. Maybe to many toys for Christmas!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|This game takes forever to download..but worth the wait..challenging mini games..with the option to skip them. My only problem is I'm on the elevator in the bonus chapter..what do you set the radio on? I cant progress past this point ..but over all good HO game
B008Y72W7U|5.0|Brilliant movie. A perfect thriller that sets the mood for any group gathering, especially when there is a huge commotion on which movie to watch.
B0081BU42O|4.0|I read it in just a few days.  Not as good as the best (Look to Windward, IMHO) but still a great read.  This guy Banks has a CRAZY imagination..
B001EN71CW|5.0|What more to write in a review here. I cannot review firefly for dummies. Buy it if you love the show. A must have!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|as a s.k. fan, i really did hate this novel. i found myself saying to others that i could not wait to get it over with. it seemed very corney to me. and the love story between george and sadie was murdurous. i respect his phenomenal writing- as always- and his diligent research, and perhaps that is about it. love him, just did not love this one
B008602KQI|4.0|I really liked the movie but I did not love it.  They did a great job of giving you just enough of the story to make you want to know more (sequels) but the premises of the story is not one that I can really get behind.  I will watch the later films in the story just to see if Katniss will take down the games.
B0052GACNM|5.0|We love Tony Bennett in this house so this CD was a great joy to us. He is the Master craftsman.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This series is amazing- first two books are nearly exact as HBO Show fyi but every book is worth the read and keeps you coming back... I love that the author is similar to a soap opera- no character is safe and you never really know if someone is truly dead.. makes things forever juicy...
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The late producer John Hughes has provided us with yet another great Christmas comedy classic!  Christmas Vacation has been one of my favorite movies for over 20 years, and each time I watch it, I laugh even harder!  Wonderful movie for the holidays or any time of the year.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|Loved the first movie, but I feel that the second movie fell short. Over all a good movie, just not as good as I anticipated.
B004EPZ034|5.0|We love this show. We watch it over an over again! No other show like it. It's a great show!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Occasionally the picture gets grainy, but it's usually short-lived. No different than streaming on Netflix or iTunes. It was a good experience.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I'm excited to have them all now. Bought all of them from Amazon! We love this show. We watch it over an over again! No other show like it.
B003QSMCKO|4.0|This is a classic family movie it was very enjoyable will diff it'll Definitely watch this movie again<br />. .
B004X4R49Y|5.0|A movie with great dialog and fantastic acting job by Colin Firth.  It's no wonder he won the Oscar.  No car chases, no guns/killing, no gratuitous sex scenes - just plain good script.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I got this item for Christmas and I started watching it and noticed a lot was missing. After I read the box set its the original aired version and not the version that was released on DVD. I'm extremely upset and I will be returning this item to get my money back. Real friends fans will know the difference and will be annoyed just like me.
B005HS00NW|5.0|When I first head this on TCM Remembers, I thought it was Peter Gabriel, but soon found out it wasn't.  Oh, well, I'd still buy it.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
0316069434|3.0|A typical Connelly/Bosch novel.  Pretty good, worth a read, but I have a few reservations.  The slogging detective work as the case is being investigated is entertaining, but the climax is way too contrived.  And why, Mr Connelly, are your characters so totally without humor, and usually in conflict with one another?  Try a few lighter moments here and there.  It won't detract from your plot.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
0345536886|5.0|Like most Grisham books this was a very entertaining read.  It's the first humorous novel I have read by this author.  Three hapless lawyers are totally out of their depth against the might of one of the country's top defense teams.  Then there are two lawyers, then just one, and for a few pages you think he might just pull it off.  After A Painted House you may have tired of Grisham.  This one will revive you.  Don't miss it.
0684824906|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy and enjoyable game. It keeps you coming back once your coin supply builds. It is fun watching the prizes tumble.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game to pass the time. It is a challenge to see how fast you can solve the game. It is fun.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game promotes in-app purchasing, which makes it an expensive trap for younger children who don't understand that they are spending real money.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|About the same masterial as the fist 2 movies with a little bit of time travel twist.  Josh Brolin does a great job portraying a younger Tommy Lee Jones, I almost forgot they weren't the same people. :)
