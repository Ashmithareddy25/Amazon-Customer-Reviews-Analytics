0307891372|5.0|This book has everything you need for an adventure in Skyrim, and what's so great about it, is that it's all in one place.  I've used it pretty heavily, and I haven't found any major problems or errors with the text.  My issue, with it, though, is that it's...well...BIG.  Sometimes, it's just easier to google it than it is to hunt it down in the book. Just a limitation of the medium--nevertheless, if you want a Skyrim strategy guide, this is hands-down a must-get.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|For the record I had never read any Tintin comic strips at all before I went to see this film. All I knew was that he was a very popular comic character from the 1950s-1960s. So without any prior knowledge I still felt that this was one of the themost enjoyable animated films in 2011.<br /><br />You have two of the best directors of the past 30 years, two incredible young script writters and a cast for the ages. The 'Adventures of TinTin' is just a rolercoaster of excitement and pefect blend of adventure and comedy. You do not need to be a Tintin purest to enjoy this one. I just hope there are sequils because I really loved it.
B002BPQ0Y2|4.0|I was able to purchase the album for $5.  At that price it was a no brainer.  Good music, all of their new songs pretty much.
B00005JM02|5.0|At barely 2, my son would sit and watch this entire movie. It's a great story, colorful, fun, not too scary and full of family love and determination. Now at 2-1/2, he likes a lot of other animated movies, but this one remains his favorite.  I personally appreciate that when I have a busy moment, or a long car trip, Nemo keeps him entertained.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun and addicting!!!!!! great time slaying zombies while being able to upgrade warriors and hero. great for all ages!
0985114606|4.0|Bared to you is a very good book but I could not give it all 5 stars for all the sex scenes. Don't get me wrong, I love this book because the complexity of the two characters with each other. I just think the sex parts are too much and I find myself glossy over them to get to their communication between them. I love the way they communicate and express their feelings to each other.<br /><br />I hope in the next book we get a point a view from Gideon too because I really want to know he feelings, thinks and wants Eva. Gideon seems to be the bad boy, we all want. Handsome, hot, mysterious, bad, scary, dominating, possessive and obsession all in one.<br /><br />I have to say I can't wait for the next book because I want to see their love and interact with me but maybe less sex. Also, I love to get more of Cary the best friend. He is interest and complex as well.
B001H1WY28|3.0|I was able to watch Hulu, WB online and bootleg epsiodes of this for free that were better quality.  I paid because I thought the quality would be better and there would be no hassle with ads and broken links, etc.  I am annoyed that I paid for this and the quality was so bad.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are fun and you dont have to pay for anything and a quick way to keep your self occupied
B004V5QWU2|5.0|My favorite sound is the rain. It typically puts me to sleep before the  timer runs out. Coming from a person who has always has issues with falling asleep, this is a much better investment than medication. Great app!
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|\\"Tower Heist\\" (2011) offers few surprises for a caper flick, yet remains a pleasant diversion - coasting on the strength of its comic ensemble and Brett Ratner's slick direction. Eddie Murphy and Matthew Broderick have their best film roles in years while Alan Alda makes a terrific Bernie Madoff-inspired scoundrel. Freewheeling escapism most of the way.
0439023513|3.0|Suzanne Collins is an amazing author. Obviously. Hunger Games and Catching Fire were AMAZING and I expected an even better book seeing as it was the last. LETDOWN. It was so dry, slow, and borderline boring in comparison to the first two books. I found myself annoyed to read but I knew I had to because I couldn't leave a series like that, but I expected better. They ending was so depressing and not to spoil it, but it could have gone different ways. It seems almost as if it should have another book attached but all in all, it is a great series that I would definitely recommend for anyone to read but just a warning to all interested readers, don't expect to fly through this book like the first two. You will be disappointed.<br /><br />Hunger Games  (amazing)<br />Catching FIre  (even more amazing)<br />Mockingjay  (letdown)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love it! It was fun to play. It was easy to order, not very expensive, and it came immediately to my kindle fire. Would recommend to anyone who is an angry birds fan.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|totally addictive I love this game. I don't know anymore how many times a day I check it. it very fun. wish it could have been easier to get acorns :)
B0043EV774|5.0|I bought this DVD for the 3D effects because I had seen the movie before on a regular TV and thought the visual aspects were just gorgeous. The colors, characters, special effects and whole production were excellent. So I was expecting some great 3D effects with some of the chase and battle scenes. The movie had good depth and 3D presentation and it made you feel like you were in there in many parts, but one of the things I like in 3D are the &#34;out of screen&#34; effects, where objects look like they're jumping out from the TV screen and ending up in the middle of your room. While some things seemed to slightly stand out, the only real out of screen effect was a butterfly flying out at the very end. Still, the 3D added a lot to an already stunning movie.<br /><br />The original Alice in Wonderland scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. That caterpillar was scarey looking and when that baby that Alice was holding turned into a pig...ugh! The only part I liked back then was the Mad Hatter. So when I heard that Johnny Depp and Anne Hathaway were starring in this new version, well, they're two of my favorite actors, so I had to see it. Helena Bonham Carter who played the Red Queen was just amazing. The animated characters were very unique too. I really enjoyed this version. And the storyline was quite a bit different than the first.<br /><br />So, would I buy this movie again for the 3D? Although it didn't have many of the oos effects, I would because it definitely enhanced a movie that I already liked for it's regular effects. But I would rate the 3D as 4 stars and the movie overall as 5.
B00006YXE4|5.0|Excellent CD and the DVD is great. Put it on and all your guest will be drawn to the TV. If your a Clapton fan, you must get this package. You'll LOVE IT!
B004YSDRC2|5.0|i think that the whole season is great i especially liked a good man goes to war and i dont understand why they called episode 8 lets kill hitler when hitler is only in it for like 5 min total. but i really want to download it onto my ipod but i cant figure out how so please if you know how tell me
B000JQU1VS|4.0|great fun to read .These short stories are perfect as a travel companion as it is easy to get back into the story Sherlock always surprises the reader and makes one wonder about once own capability to observe life.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Finally, OMGPOP has made the kindle fire version for draw something. Now all the amazon appstore needs is temple run, tiny wings, tiny tower and my favorite... flick homerun.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun game. Nice example of a phone side scrolling defense game. So far I haven't had any issues with it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a blast,  and has an endless amount of humorous. I find my self checking in on my village throughout the day. A lot of fun.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the trilogy.  Engaging from first page to last.  If read on on a level beyond that of enjoying the glimpse of  an interesting world, but as a predictor of our future, it's provocative!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love how I can connect with my cousin with fb and play this app!!!! its soooooo much fun now all I need is temple run! :) also why spend 2 dollars whenvyou can get the free version? (:
B007UXSPK2|2.0|I gave it a couple of stars, just because I actually like the MI flicks, and they kind of grew on me, so after reading the critics, I figure it was worth a shot...but it all seemed like 'play-acting' and suspension of disbelief for all the stuff they did was a little much.  I mean, they should have made it more cerebral and less physical, but the seemed to have gone in the opposite direction, like they would with a *rising* action star, and not Tom Cruise.<br /><br />I won't go into details: I sat down, ready to enjoy a movie, and got more and more bored.  Finally couldn't watch anymore.  TC needs to go back to acting school, and learn another way to seem 'angry' other than just lowering his head and looking up at his opponent...I'm so sick of that little 'move' of his which he started in MI1, and I guess somebody liked...anyway, no good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great app. it is perfect for everyday needs.  no problems so far. easy to use and understand.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! It's awesome for planning my week and knowing whether i will be going to a soccer game or going home.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Can't wait for season 2 to come out!! My boyfriend loves George RR Martin but I wasn't sure if I would like it. I Love it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you have to have to get it so fun for free so please plaese get it. if you don't get it you will be so bored. with out it so get it get it
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun side scroller. Not very difficult but still entertaining. Glu has put some great games out recently. I recommend this.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|after I spent time going to level 50 start acting up timers reset randomly to 325000 hours.<br />impossible to continue<br />has to be erased. what a waste of time!!!!
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|What a difference great 3d makes.I saw this movie in 2d and it was just so-so.Read the positive reviews on the 3d blu ray version and bought it.Pop out 3d abounds in this movie.This one I will keep and rewatch.Good action,great 3d !!
B003L77GH4|5.0|This is such a great show. Twist and turns at every corner. Great watch for vamp loverrs. A must buy
B00540G3G6|1.0|Ever since I had the pleasure of viewing the heavyweight champion of 3d movies..Coraline,i've been wanting to see Tim Burtons other 3d movie Nightmare b4 Xmas.Man was I disapointed!! Bleak boring musical,terrible 3d,graphics to dark,boring plot(what plot),etc,etc.No pop out 3d in this one.If 3d is your thing get Coraline and don't waste your money on this one.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|This 70th Anniversary Edition of Citizen Kane has everything you would ever want to know about the making of the film and the consequences of it's release.<br /><br />The real-life PBS documentary and the dramatized film RKO 281 are perfect compliments to the film itself. A fascinating story of how the film was made and how it was almost destroyed before it was ever seen by the public.
B0073U2F12|1.0|Because i'm a 3d lover sometimes I can put up with a so-so plot if the 3d is good.This movie was bad in both areas.From boring aliens that were balls of energy that zapped you to death with rays,to terrible 3d,this is one you shouldn't waste your time or money on.This went in for a store credit towards another movie the next day.Should've been titled \\"The Darkest Hour 1/2\\" for time I wasted watching this nonsence.
B00479SVBU|5.0|It is rare to find a product that exceeds expectations.  Great design and functionality.  Very fast shipping.  Will be buying one for each car we have.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This Angry Birds game is out-of-this-world! Litteraly! The game takes place in outer space, where the birds are alien-like, but still ready for revenge. Of course the adorable uninnocent pigs look the same, but they tend to enjoy floating around in bubbles in places hard for your Angry Birds to reach. Thank you for the TNT, which usually helps me with getting those tough piggies. Also, so you know, this game does not have adds and does have many levels, with more coming for free btw, and works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. I highly reccomend this game for any Angry Birds lovers.<br /><br />Updated after 2 months of ownership.<br />Why doesn't it update more? I have defeated all the levels and utopia isn't even finished!!!<br /><br />After new update:<br />reduced one star. I got the update and I had to start all over! not fair.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Books were easy to download and I loved reading them! I will purchase more books through the kindle on amazon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great for kids it can get addictive trying to get more games! my kids enjoy it and I admit I like it as well....
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|really good except it takes a little while to load and getting energy back is slow but otherwise good game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cant stop playing this game so fun. little games within the game super fun. you have chances to earn acorn so you don't have to buy them if you don't want to.
0385344228|3.0|Was a very slow read.  But, the ending was unpredicable.  If you can stay with it that long.  The subject of the Father - Son relationship was interesting.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found the Fifty Shades series to be very emotionally draining, but highly addictive.  Christian and Ana's story continues in Fifty Shades Darker.  At the end of Fifty Shades of Grey, Ana leaves Christian, certain that their differences will always be an obstacle.  Book 2 begins (from Ana's point of view, again) with Ana trying to deal with the loss of the relationship and sorting out her feelings.  Is she relieved or regretful?  Luckily, we aren't kept waiting long before Christian reappears, and I have to say, I really like this \\"new\\" Christian.  He's still controlling and possessive, but he is a bit less intense as he realizes that Ana offers him what he needs.  Finally, we begin to understand him better as the \\"lost boy\\" as Ana calls him. There are a lot of sex scenes again, but I found them less disturbing than in the first book.  (Who would have thought an author would use sex scenes to portray the development of a romantic relationship?  But it's true....) Christian is more of a romantic hero, with a dark side, and  he can be very persuasive as he tries to deliver what he promised Ana in book 1--MORE.  If you read the first book, this is a must-read, and unlike the first book, the ending is perfect.  There's a bit of \\"happily ever after\\" along with a teaser to tie-in to the final book.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|What a powerful story! What makes it even more so is that it's based on a true story!<br /><br />How tragic for this poor woman to lose her memory due to a car accident, and also tragic for the husband, to realize the wife he so dearly loves doesn't know who he is??<br /><br />But that's the premise for this movie, and the journey they take after the fateful accident is full of pitfalls and dangers to their relationship.<br /><br />I highly recommend you see this with your wife or girlfriend!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say that thousands of women have not already said about this book. This is great sex therapy for  couples who need to bring excitement back into their lives.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Its true. You cant accidentally spend money unless your a kid that cant read yet. This game IS addicting. Love it. I actually have spent money because I want things and its no big deal. $4.99 for 24 gems is more than enough to buy some nice tables n chairs or whatever else. The game also gives you gems after you pass certain levels. Anyways..highly addictive game! ;) -valerybrutality
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  Tender love story with a balance of understanding & emotion.  Mr. Sparks has an unbridled talent to make the reader feel every character.  I think the way each one displays Patience for one another allows you to appreciate them and their story even more.  Kudos!
B00634GHJA|5.0|easy to use and allows me quick access to my pictures.  got as the free app for the day but would def. pay for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love 101 games it the best game ever i love it i love it i love it!!!!!!!!!!! ( :
B0058VW36U|1.0|Such a terrible update - deleted all my hard work with a new update.  I had all stars, now I have zero after the update.  Now I either have to replay the whole game or pay to unlock all levels?
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like this game very much. It has good upgrades, its simple and fun. My daughter enjoys it as well.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw Something free, as well as Draw Something (paid), are really fun apps. the only difference from free to paid is that the free has more ads, even though I don't mind that. It is so fun to connect with friends or random people. it is like charades but with drawing instead. clearly awesome app. totally get.
B00540G3G6|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I haven't watched the 3D version but I watched the Blue Ray version of it and I loved it so much more than the regular dvd I've had for the longest time. This is a must have for any Nightmare Before Christmas fan!
1595827684|5.0|This is a great compilation of art from all three games of the Mass Effect trilogy. It combines the contents of previously released art books for each game, and includes lots of new art from each.<br /><br />For those who haven't finished ME3, be warned there are spoilers within the first couple pages of the third section!<br /><br />In terms of art, it runs the gamut- there is a wealth of character art, location designs and the evolution of the designs for each of the races. All of these also include brief commentary of where a character or race started, and how/why they ended up at the final design-- nice to get a little glimpse into the art teams head.<br /><br />The book itself is of solid quality-- definitely a must have for Mass Effect fans!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game ever! just like super Mario bros!!!!!!!!! I rate this game for any one young or old!! you should down load this game!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|If u love solitaire....this is the game for u.<br />Very addictive.<br />Don't miss out on this good time.<br />Get it today.

B007FH22VQ|5.0|Cover to cover an amazing album. Demiurge and swarm stand out especially. The mastering of the album is incredible. Worth the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very fast moving and kept your interest throughout.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app yet. It's an awesome Bible that has multiple translations to choose from. The audio component is also fantastic!!! I'm thankful to have it. Blessed to be able to study the Word of God using this app!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|FINALLY A GOOD GAME SINCE ANFRY BIRDS ON THE KINDOE FIRE!!!!!! there r some good games but not for kindle I think its fun u get to pick something to draw and then u draw it and the other person has to guess what it is its really fun I think we need to get more games like this for the kindle like temple run (which I already haVe cuz I'm a beast but anyways I would recomend this game for all u ppl even if u cant draw it is on my favorites. :) ;)
B000AP04FG|5.0|A fun, action comedy, that displays the extraordinary chemistry between these two great actors.  Clever, witty and endearing dialogue, wonderful repartee
1936891026|5.0|Some things you read and you just know they are true. That is this book.<br /><br />It's the inspiration and the kick in the butt I need. The advice my father tried to give me but I never understood.<br /><br />The one-star reviews here are hilarious. Resistance in action!<br /><br />Note: If you don't like swearing (as I don't) then be prepared for some, including at least one f-bomb. But read the book anyway. It's not a vulgar book.
B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|Honestly, this review is easy. If you have heard a Katy Perry song you've liked, you'll like the album - all of the songs have a similar sort of feeling, and if you liked what you've heard before, you'll like the album. But if you didn't like her music already, this CD won't change your mind.
0345803485|3.0|Just finished the book.... Mr. Grey is a straight-up freak, somewhere between pervert and deviant.....but......he has a certain charm.....and not sure I could resist it......Guess I know what the hype's about now.  3.5 stars because it was an interesting & unpredictable read, and the writing wasn't as horrible as other reviewers would have you think.  But, character development is not strong.  And maybe she could have edited a few sex scenes.... because it was a little overkill, we get it - they are weirdly attracted to each other, but not each of these scenes advances the plot of the novel.  And it sort of made the book border onto the line between erotica & just plain porn.<br /><br />Interesting read.  Wonder if the author has a Q & A, for like a reading group?  I'd like to know what she intended when she wrote this book.... Because I think you could see this book as simply erotica, and strangely nice - which leaves everyone blushing & a little disturbed I think.  Or I wonder if she had themes in mind when she wrote it?  I sort of wondered if it were her take on historical romance novels - the \\"contract\\" Mr. Grey referring to compared to the marriage contract of the 18th/19th century - women were basically \\"owned\\" by their husbands.  Then I sort of thought:  beauty and the beast sort of theme; hey when Belle decides to not be afraid of his scary exterior & takes the time to know him, the beast is pretty sweet - but he's still a beast who scares her.... until he turns into a prince at the end because she loves him and the story ends happily ever after.  Not sure this story will end happily.  Not sure I want to find out.  Not sure I can honestly take reading anymore really kinky sex scenes..... I think I need a break to gather myself, because the next book is like \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" or something?  DARKER, dear Lord how can he get darker?<br /><br />How the HELL does THIS get made into a movie that's not NC-17?
0670023329|5.0|One hopes that \\"Escape from Camp 14\\" acts like a clarion call in the night and motivates the world to address the sustained evil that is the Kim Family's North Korea.<br /><br />While Hitler's Concentration Camps lasted no longer than the twelve years of his \\"Thousand Year Reich,\\" North Korean concentration camps are reaching their sixty year mark.  That time, along with the original Kim's dictum that enemies of the state should have \\"three generations of their seed removed\\" from his fiefdom means that there are thousands of Koreans who have been born - indeed bred - in concentration camps and know nothing of life outside the wire.<br /><br />So it was with Shin Dong-hyuk, the product of a father who was awarded a wife and allowed (as all prisoners so rewarded are allowed) to spend five nights a year with his bride.  Shin was the offspring of that arranged pairing and literally never new anything except guards, beating, privation and work from his earliest years.  Enrolled in \\"school\\" until his mid-teens, Shin's schooling consisted for the majority of the time of work in the camp at various chores.  Rudimentary Korean letters and math were provided, but he grew to maturity literally not knowing anything about the outside world.  He never heard of China, the United States, South Korea or had any context at all in which to compare his bleak world.  He knew only guards who were in total charge of his life and his class of prisoners who were his competitors for food and the other necessities of survival.<br /><br />So thoroughly controlled by the camp system, Shin witnessed the killing of a six year old classmate over five kernels of corn, turned in his fellow students for infractions, participated in beatings of his classmates as he was beaten - and knew no remorse, guilt or feelings.  Kim even turned his mother and older brother into the guards when they talked of escape, furious that their efforts would lead to his execution under the assumption that he would have known of their plans (he was arrested and tortured anyway, as the guard he tattled to failed to inform his superiors that Shin was the one who exposed the escape attempt).  Kept in a perpetual state of exhaustion and starvation, clad in rags and subject to the beatings and humiliations of the lowliest guard at anytime for any reason, Shin was an animal reduced to thinking constantly of survival.<br /><br />By luck he met a political prisoner who had served North Korea abroad before running afoul of the regime and who was able to paint a world outside the wire for Shin.  Even luckier, Shin and his friend concocted an absurd escape plan that gained for Shin his freedom when his friend's body hung on the electric wire of their camp fence and Shin was able to climb over it to the world outside.<br /><br />Blaine Hardin has written a thin, but powerful and necessary book chronicling Shin's experience and escape to and adjustment in the West.  He intersperses Shin's story with facts and descriptions of life in North Korea and the camp system that keeps hundreds of thousands of North Korean's behind wire and struggling daily to avoid death from starvation, execution, beating, overwork, the amusement of jailers and/or neglect.  It is truly a fascinating glimpse into a world rarely seen by the outside and about which few specifics are known.<br /><br />North Korea is truly a bizarre place that has seen organized evil practiced on its citizens by a small, ruling clique.  The government deserves to be overthrown by whatever means that could be accomplished and these North Koreans deserve the world's sympathy and attention.  Blaine Hardin by this book and the gripping story of Shin Dong-hyuk has hopefully made that needed attention more likely.own of their plans (he was arrested and tortured anyway, as the guard he tattled to failed to inform his superiors that Shin was the one who exposed the escape attempt).

0792843584|4.0|So much has been written about this movie that the experience of actually watching it is unique: you find yourself trying to ignore the critics, and just lose yourself in, what is, a pretty special film. Yes, it damaged the director's reputation. Yes, it bankrupted the studio. Yes, it failed at the time to live up to the hype. And yet, leaving all that aside, we have as sumptuously a mounted western as you'll ever see, and a complex, fascinating story. For too long people have been unwilling to forgive the perfectionism that went into the production. What they're missing is a film which takes the time to set up a recreation of a true chain of events which ought to be remebered - for comparison, watch the much shorter, glossier Johnson County War. This is the real deal. Buy the full-length Director's Cut, not the truncated version. If you love Hollywood history, especially the 70s when this was devised and filmed, then this is right up there in terms of significance with The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Not to say that Heaven's Gate isn't flawed. There are traces of self-indulgence - moments when we want a gritty West, not touches of David Lean. But we should remain thankful that one man persevered with his vision towards the end of a time when films like this were still being made.
0345803485|1.0|While I am not a romance novel reader, the overwhelming press on this book had me convinced it would be worth checking out.  I purchased this on my Kindle and am giving up on it before I'm a quarter of the way through. In the news today, a woman had a successful outcome suing Nutella for implying it's a healthy food when all she had to do was read the label; maybe we should pursue a class-action suit for believing all the hype about this ridiculous book.
B005KELW26|5.0|I have absolutely NO complaints about this case!  Its perfect! I love the color, the easy access to all buttons,everything. I have kids who use my Kindle Fire, so it gets dropped a bit. This case has kept it safe. Love it!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I love musicals, especially this one with Robert Preston and Shirley Jones.  I wanted my grandchildren to see this one.  So I added this to my collection in DVD format since all I had was a video tape copy.  I love all the extras DVD's can add - such as \\"the making of the movie\\".  It adds so much when you can see some of the things that go on behind the scenes.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This is the movie that made me enthusiastic about computer animation. For some reason, I did not like Toy Story. Maybe I was afraid it would mean the end of traditional animation, which I think is a fine art form (I am glad those movies are still out there), or perhaps it was just the story itself. Toy Story is what I would personally call a \\"boy movie.\\" Anyway, at first glance, Shrek being an ogre seems to make this a boy movie, but then it has the princess story also. I think this movie is good for just about everyone. I notice some reviewers complain that it is not necessarily appropriate for kids. I did not really enjoy the exploding bird, and it had a little too much bathroom humor for my personal taste, but I don't have kids myself, so I didn't have any of that to worry about.<br /><br />I liked the story, I liked the characters, I liked the cultural references, I liked the jokes... I could go on. Much of it seemed to be funny without even trying! Most of the movies I own are dramas, or psychological movies, or science fiction, and I love them. It is not that I dislike comedies. I really enjoy comedies. It is just really hard to find a good comedy. And Shrek is a good comedy!<br /><br />Back to my first comment, I was especially impressed by the animation. (If I could have any career I wanted, working on movies like this would be my dream job.) The attention to detail was amazing. The fiery flame pits at the dragon's castle. The stones that built the castle. Shrek's skin. Fiona's pretty red hair. Even the grass and flowers. Everything was just beautiful. And I'd swear there were real live humans mixed in that dancing scene! (Just a disclaimer: I think there are many movies that overdo the CGI these days. We do need SOME acting and plot!)<br /><br />I love the three sequels and give them all 5 stars as well. They just get better and better! Well, the first may be the best, with the most charm, but the sequels keep up the high standard of quality.
B007R41E8O|3.0|The game was fun. Took me about an hour and a half to finish.<br />THE DOWNLOAD. So I read many reviews and they all said yeah the download is long. So I was thinking 5-10 minutes top. WRONG. Download takes about 45 minutes. I downloaded to the kindle fire. It did crash twice on me throughout the whole game but I just went back into game and continued where I was.<br />Just BEWARE long download.
0345803485|1.0|Mommy Porn fantasy that has no depth, no reality and nothing but stupidity,<br /><br />I would guess those whom like it would be the ones that think the twilight series is actually literature
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a surprise !  I did not expect much from this book. I had never heard of the author. I expected a John Grisham knockoff. I was pleasantly surprised. \\"Defending Jacob\\" is a thrill ride in a dust jacket. Once you start this book you will want to know how it will end. Just when you think you have the story figured out, the story turns in another direction.<br /><br />The ending is a kick and a half.<br /><br />Bravo to William Landay !!!
B007SSEBCU|1.0|Dreadful film making. I can imagine the outcry if the story of Reagan was told in a similar way. I was really looking forward to learning the story of Maggie, but hated the time given to 'current' story / dementia (not sure if it is even accurate) and the focus on aspects of her later life that are so unimportant. I rarely tune out during a movie, and didn't expect to on this one, but I did. It's a real shame as the actresses were great. It totally deserves the number of one star reviews it is getting. What an opportunity missed. Hopefully someone one day will tell Maggie's story properly. I was never a fan of the lady, but wanted to see the story of a strong British PM done right. Not sure who was responsible for this indulgent pap, but they don't deserve another movie to make.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|this app is everything I wanted and more. I can create,edit and save any file. plus I can link it with my box account. So far I'm happy with it. thanks for making it free.
0385534639|4.0|This was a good book--well-written, mystical, magical, and fun. I found the first half more compelling than the resolution, the early descriptions of magic, midnight dinners, the circus tents, and characters to be dreamlike; they pulled me along effortlessly and I loved the ride. I liked the multiple storylines and points of view interweaving throughout the book, too. I found the book to lull a bit after the midway point and some aspects of the ending to be too convenient or unfulfilling, but I'd still recommend it for the writing style as much as anything. It's just a pleasure to read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book and a good copy. The copy of this book had every single page the real one does even the cover page.
B006WM2FFS|5.0|I was lucky enough to study Chinese martial arts theater (in brief) some years before watching this film. Even the trailers intoxicated me, and I went out of my way to get to see it. As a film, it did not take long to reach legendary status in China. However, the reception here must have been minimal.<br />The colors of the film coordinate with the attitude behind the story. Red is the color in order to portray everyone as heroic, while blue is the color used to portray everyone as deceptive. There is perhaps more nuance to it than I can even capture.<br />The style flows like a well choreographed ballet, and the battle sequences are often hypnotizing. Although reminiscent of films like Crouching Tiger or House of Flying Daggers, there is so much of the film that is stylistically so original and striking that it is even hard to make comparisons. Yet, fans of those films will appreciate this treasure.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is one of my favorite movies.  Mike Myers' Scottish accent adds just enough aura without being overdone, as does Eddie Murphy's annoying sidekick routine with Donkey.  Good comedy, and clean enough for the whole family to enjoy.
B00275EGWY|5.0|The motivation is to defeat the opponent. The opponent is the mirror in the enemy. The focus is total. Victory is defined in the act. I was going to buy \\" Jar Head \\".<br />I saw this one and am glad I go it. You could see Adrenaline as the high. The High is the focus; positive and negative = nothing: neutralized and thereby the enemy intention becomes nothing. Focus on this one.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|for my opinion it is not a trial app it lets me save documents so I would get this app
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|You see a lot of different films being drawn into this one but timing is everything and the pace focuses on the action, just enough to pull it together. I saw an alternate ending. However, I have a hunch there will be a sequel or a series under different titles.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was great!!!! She did an excellent job letting us get to know each character. I especially like the two star crossed lovers thing, I wish she showed more on katiness's part though.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a good app minus the constant errors and ads. I always accidentally press the ads because the game comes on and the ads block it.
B004SRNH10|5.0|Why are people hating on Adobe?  I'd like to see more use of AIR.  It does it's job, just like JRE.  iPhone users are just jealous...
0920668372|1.0|A friend highly recommended this book which she read to her children when they were little. I decided to order it to put in a gift basket for a coworker who is having her first baby. Fortunately, I read through the book when it arrived--it won't be going in the gift basket! It is a weird, creepy, bizarre, strange story! I might add that the friend who recommended this book has grown children (late 20's) who are still living with her.
B007Q476KU|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have seen in Blu-ray. I'm NOT talking about the PQ .The plot is weak, the acting is ingenious, there are some ridiculous actors, all is superficial and ... how can I say? Is this the director that made \\"MUNIQUE\\"??? I can't believe!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is great but if u want it to make sence at least read The Lost Hero it makes it easier but If u want really easy read the Percy Jackson books first!! The Son if Neptune is really good
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love it. its addictive and my kind of game (kill stuff+upgrade+kill stuff again).  I am surprised that this is a free game.  ^_^
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are lots of fun games to play on 101-in-1 Games. I enjoy playing it when I am bored and not busy doing other things.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I just lost all of my progress and all of the characters I unlocked were gone add well as all of the Glu coins that I had earned all gone.  I was just beginning to think that this was a great game.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|great!!! I was soon gonna buy it but hesitated and got it for free!!! super addicting and fun on the fire
0345803485|2.0|I had originally given it a 3 but I have reduced it to a 2 because I couldn't even finish it...<br />Where do I start? What can I say that hasn't already been said? The only thing keeping me from giving this book a 1 or a 2 is the fact that I am intrigued with Christian and I am hopeful of what might happen with their relationship. At the beginning I was intrigued, by page 330 I was frustrated and now, at page 484, I am seriously starting to question whether or not I will be able to finish the book. Here are the main issues: It's repetitive, unrealistic (For real? She's a virgin that has never masturbated and she can deep throat a d*ck, on the first try, without gagging? lol as I spit out my wine), etc, etc. He's too damn jealous to be a dom. and I am growing weary of her incessant wishy-washy-ness. Over all, it's an interesting story but it is almost as if the author drew it out for length rather than substance. It's very simple: The contract cannot be held up in court. If you don't like it (BDSM) you can stop and never see him again or you can sign the d*mn contract! It's worse than waiting on a small child, at Baskin Robbins, to decide what flavor of ice cream they want. The good points: Christian is... oh, so cool, but I dare say that most of my interest in him evolves from my own desire to experience this BDSM type relationship and not so much from what's presented before me. The s*xy scenes are...well, s*xy...but I don't think it's going to get too BDSM in the first book. Someone said that the s*x scenes are \\"vanilla\\" and if you are looking for BDSM in this book, then they would be right. Maybe that will come in the second but at this point I'm not sure I want to buy it and take the time to find out. Someone else said that, \\"...in between the repetitions listed above, the author inexplicably throws whatever was on her \\"word a day calendar\\" into character conversation where it sounds silly and awkward,\\" and this is absolutely right. You know, at the end of theday, I say, get the book, like I did and see for yourself. You may love it. At this point, I don't intend on getting the whole trilogy but I wouldn't count the author out completely.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app. is amazing. u get to draw with friends and chat with them. (Wellllllllllllllllllll sortof.  :)  )  of I were you I would get this app immediately. :)
B007V2UGPE|4.0|only on wave 6 but I see it getting very challenging.  looking forward to pplaying more after my office nap!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|had to force close a few times due to game freeze up. but a fun game in all. will definitely continue to play
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are so many games to chose from and I really like that. the only problem would have to be the pricing of the games. other then that I would have to say that I have had a lot of fun with this app.
B0011EBDE6|5.0|This movie is more than just a story about awakening to what life is about.<br />When I first saw this movie years ago, I was entertained by its quaint twists and turns and the interactions of the \\"brothers\\" with each other. After watching it for a second time today, the thought crossed my mind...What if I didn't have a family to share life's experiences with? What if I couldn't spend time on the phone or in person reflecting with my brother and sister about those crazy memories we have of growing up together? The hardships, the laughter, death, marriage, birth, divorce UGH...I wouldn't want to live anymore if I couldn't share those memories with someone special.<br />You can't just watch this movie once. Every line between the characters gives meaning to life...every argument...every memory...every look they give each other. Their journey to find happiness isn't easy, but it triumphs over the misery of their petty lives.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|one of shinedown's best and i have them all !!!!  they totally outdid themselves this time !!!!!  if you are not a shinedown fan .. this CD will make you into one for sure
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't want to put this book down. I read the entire series in less than a week. I would definitely recommend this book
1439196834|5.0|If you find NPH's Barney Stinson quite the comedic act, this is worth a read.  Hey maybe some of these even work.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Its like angry birds, its a good time wasting game, but its not something that you take very seriously. I love it. Easy controls.
143911000X|5.0|More guys in the world should read this book.  It has a funny way of telling guys to treat their friends with respect, kind of.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|With homage to that great southern rock band from Florida named Lynyrd Skynyrd, Whiskey Myers taps into that fine line between country and rock where Southern Rock lives. This was a surprisingly excellent find for me. Instead of shredding a guitar to sound bad, they make every note mean something. As a guitarist who can appreciate a meaningful lick, that means something. The lyrics on top are well thought out with well laid down. If you are a fan of the \\"Freebird\\" band, you can hear the influence but they keep it new and fresh. I was impressed. They remind me of the Drive-by Truckers without the overload on depression and darkness. An excellent surprise.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Amazing free game all my friends like to play! its challanging and fun to play. reminds me of Mario. Must have free game!
B0070Z97LG|2.0|The film follows the familiar path of a new family in a new house and \\"bad things happen\\". Unfortunately, if you've seen the trailer you'll likely know the major twist of the film which makes the first 45 minutes very slow. Fortunately, there's enough material to send the audience into creative overdrive, predicting all sorts of possibilities about the characters and how Daniel Craig ended up where he was. Unfortunately, most of the audience's ideas will be better than what actually transpires and the movie arrives at a soggy Act 3 that falls into total absurdity.<br /><br />** PARTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD **<br /><br />Such as why did Naomi Watts not help out Craig when he spent five years in a mental hospital for something he didn't do? Or why did Watts' husband return to a crime scene where he'd effectively gotten away with the crime? It's one of those films that lacks the finesse of more tightly plotted twisty films like The Sixth Sense, and when you play it backwards it doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny.<br /><br />Overall, it's well acted and the setup has some promise. I don't know if this story was a victim of multiple re-writes but it shifts gears halfway through and everything that was good about the premise is wasted.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great for free app.  but you run out of energy too fast within 5 minutes. ...unless you spend real money to buy more energy all the time.  this can be frustrating as it doesn't allow you to play but in short 5 minute bursts.  then you have to wait an hour or so for your energy to rejuvenate.<br />still a great game if you don't mind spending most of your time waiting for energy to replenish.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|The two main reasons for buying this are the 'kickstand' and 'typing position' features - the first holds the Kindle at a roughly 75 degree angle and the second is closer to 30 degrees. The steeper angle is good for viewing video comfortably though getting the cover the fold into the tab securely can be a challenge. The typing position is less successful and moves too much as your fingers touch the screen though some people may find it better than typing in a completely flat position.<br /><br />The faux leather exterior and small space for credit cards make it a good cover if you use the device for business though it's definitely not a replacement wallet. For the price, the quality is fairly average and it will be interesting to see how it holds up to nicks and scratches over the coming months. I also own the [[ASIN:B005HSG3DI Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Black]] nylon cover which I prefer for every day use due to its (unadvertised) water resistant qualities and generally higher build quality. But if you really need the kickstand feature, this isn't a bad option especially given the price.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this app. I downloaded it off the Internet and it kept crashing and I just got sick but then here it is!!! THANK YOU SO MUCHO!!!!
1612130283|1.0|Don't waste your money buying 50 Shades.  Mine is going back to Amazon as soon as I can get it packaged and out of my house.  Really mad at myself for buying all three!  I read 24 pages and had to force myself to get through that much just hoping it would get better.  Interesting premise - horrible delivery.  Wish I could give it zero stars!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this was a very very very very very cool way to combine all the games in one hug package. I enjoyed it tjorougly
1451683405|2.0|I like Harris. Loved his other books. Wanted to like this one. It's one of my favorite topics.<br />But I can't say whether I liked it or not. It felt like Sam sat down after half a bottle of wine<br />and scribbled his ideas about free will and turned it into a short essay.<br />  A bit scattered and rambling with not a lot evidence. Just opinion.<br />  And I wasn't really sure what his point was by the end.<br /><br />  Disappointing.<br /><br />  Don Lessnau, Redford, MI
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i have been side loading this app for a while and i love it. glad i can have easier access to updates now.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|The game was adequate until world 9-2. It's forced forward, and by that I mean your character (Lep) is forced to move forward. This was done earlier in the game and did not bother me. What DID bother me is that you have to make a decision between an upper and lower platform, and one will lead to your imminent death. So, you have a fifty percent chance of losing one life from the very beginning. If that's not enough, once you get past the first choice you once again have to choose an upper or lower platform, and once again you have a fifty percent chance of losing a life. So, remember that thrill of trying to get through a game even if you only have one life? That's all thrown out the window. You're almost guaranteed to die at least once, and that's a terrible thing for a game to do. It would be one thing if one platform lead to an ALMOST impossible escape, but when I say it's imminent I mean IT DROPS YOU INTO LAVA. NER BROTHERS?!! MORE LIKE DUR BROTHERS I AM MAD. I AM MAD. I AMMMMMMMM
B005VTS4EY|4.0|seems to have some pretty good puzzles, they only take a couple seconds to solve but there are a bunch to keep u busy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loves this book. You really fall in love with all of the characters. You fun yourself wanting to be Ana and wanting Christian to do naughty things to you. Couldn't put it down once I started reading. Bought all three right away. Looking forward to more EL James books in the future.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My life has now been transformed....<br />Priorities have changed...<br />Change is good. Right?<br />Heck yes it is!<br />This is by far the most addictive game out right now. Work has just taken a step down frim the totem pole. Sleep is not as important as I was lead to believe. You must play!
B001NLKT60|4.0|So about a year after I read Girl with the dragon tattoo, I finally got around to reading the girl who played with fire.  It's another long book, which is good.  I enjoyed this one more than the first.  It's well written and the plot spins out nicely.  Again, as in the first you get a nice mystery situation and it really isn't to clear what's going on exactly until the end.  The revelation about Salanders past was completely unexpected in my opinion.  My one complaint is the book litterally just ends, and there is no wrap up whatsoever.  I understand it's a trilogy, but the book just plain stops to be picked up in the next installment.  Still I would highly encourage those interest to pick this one up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was the right mix of science fiction and drama.  It took me a bit to get into it but once hooked, I could not put it down.  I could believe in the characters and feel for them...Great job...keep them coming
0345803485|1.0|I read this \\"book\\" when it was a 50 chapter fanfiction about Edward and Bella. It was pretty good, I thought, certainly better quality fanfiction then what I had been reading. But it is not worth nine bucks, nor does the 'replace all' nature of selling one's FANFICTION to the general public make one's work better.<br /><br />I read it as a fanfiction and now judge it as a novel. 1 star.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My boy plays this game every day.  Awesome job!  Keep up the good work! He especially likes adding up his money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a lot of sci-fi on my kindle and this is by far the best book i've read in a long time.  The story incredibly immersive but the writing was was really did it for me.  Hugh's writing style is solid, concise and doesn't wander.  The story is so well told, leaving out the common stupidity that so many other stories rely on to progress a story, that I could find myself believing in the world Hugh so richly brings to life.<br /><br />I really hope he continues the story as he teased about at the end...  Can't wait.<br />p.s.- Loved the Q&A section at the end... Truly genius!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Hard to unlock games without having to sign up for something to get free points. overall good though.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|The game is THE BEST. I LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH MY FRIENDS! The game is awesome like I said its epic!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|definitely one of the better games on the market. they actually make it possible to earn credits.so you dont just hav to buy them
B006TLFIAQ|2.0|The action was alright bu there never is a real reason to root for the assassins, in fact I wanted Clive Owen's character to kill them all.  De Niro really didn't do much and Statham's character was unlikeable, as before the only character worth anything is Owen who is probably the only male that isn't a douche bag.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its fun but...<br />I need to buy coins!<br />why...<br />because they want your money.<br />yes it is true yea.<br />just its fun.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game provides endless fun and is a great way to occupy your time. I HIGHLY recomend it to all ages.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|it will not connect to facebook. it takes me back to my main app page. probably end up deleting the app.
B00634GHJA|5.0|great app for transferring photos to another phone 60 photos in about a minute! super easy to use. I am glad I got this app!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Like the other reviews say there is no difference between the import and the American version. Save some money and get this you wont be disappointed. Oh and the quality is fantastic.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Like all the others here, I thought PI for the Kindle Fire would be great -- and that it would compare favorably with the version I've grown to love on other platforms (PalmOS, Windows Phone, and iOS). Nothing could be further from the truth. This app TRULY SUCKS. It does NOT sync with Google Calendar; I haven't figured out if this was \\"on purpose\\" or if Amazon somehow crippled it for their app store. But regardless of why, don't waste your money! I wish I could get a refund, that $6.50 would have purchased a nice fast food lunch instead of a worthless app I've already deleted. So disappointed...
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I just received this little beauty and I am impressed! Heavy duty and sharp! Shaved the hair off my arm right out of the box! Wasn't as big as I thought it would be but you can tell it will get the job done. The sheath is just ok. Not a big deal. I read other reviews and kind of expected that. Gonna suit it with a proper sheath soon enough. Knife gets 5 stars! Sheath is just so so.
B0028T6XXY|2.0|Although I really like Michael Buble, I was disapointed in the cd. There is an extra cd in there that does not work or has<br /> anything on it and I just wonder why that is. Is there supposed music on it?<br />I probably would  not order another on of his again.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Erna Suverkropp
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this for free via the Kindle Lending Library and I'm glad I did. An enjoyable and quick read (in fact I read it in 27 hours). Collins does a great job of setting up a dystopian future and helping the reader discover it through natural dialogue and first person narrative. Nothing incredible in terms of literary merit (well written to be sure), but fun escapism nonetheless. I look forward to next month when I can get the second book via the lending library.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I like this cd better than the first on I reviewed, but I guess I expected more and also I did not care for some  of the songs or they way he sang them.<br />I am spoiled by some of the really great singers from the past, I guess.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Erna Suverkropp
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I thought this was just an OK addition to the overall series. The plots seem to be really dragging, especially since Martin seems intent on figuring out the name of the next new knight and detailing his history than advancing the plot of the book. Seemed like a lot of fluff in book 5 to get a sixth book published.  Whatever happened to Rickon??
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been waiting forever for this app they finaly have it! I'm so happy. yes yes. yes yes yes yes yes yes !!!!!!!!!!!!!  :{)
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Solve a mystery with puzzles and lots of hidden object locations to play.  Its better quality and longer than most apps like it I've seen for android. Detailed Story line which stayed interesting through the game.
B00783NPVI|5.0|I am very please with this DVD.  The acrylic encased flower from the wedding is great. I loved the movie too.  I would recommend this DVD.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great game. a little buggy at time but fun to play, kids will love it like the movies. could play for hours if I has more coins and acrons.
B001DJ7PNW|4.0|I inadvertently discarded the loose back page of the JFK Blu-Ray book when I received it and now I don't have the bar code for the movie program that I have. Could someone please send the bar code to me. Thank you. John  johnmuussphoto@yahoo.com
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a good game sow far its not to bad will its slow to get stared no way to kill zombies  but for the gamed to do it
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This was a read. The characters were likable and page by page I was drawn in. If there is anything that I can say that was a frustrating hang up for me was the amount of grammatical errors that I noticed. I am not sure if the hard cover is like that, but the kindle version is.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. recharges fast. free. good graphics love love love love love love love love love love love love love
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am completely obsessed with the \\"50 Shades\\" trilogy.  \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is best book I have read in a long time for complete escape factor.  To call it Mommy Porn is a complete injustice.  The characters are interesting and the story is full of twists and turns and emotional ups and downs.  It is impossible not to fall in love with \\"50\\" (both the book and the character).  A MUST read - and in many reader's experiences I'm hearing about, a must read multiple times!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its pretty good. A little slow at times but overall I like it. It takes forever to get going with it so don't expect to be able to play for more than 15 Minsk at a time. It takes forever to get anywhere because they want you to buy points. :(
B00004YZ36|3.0|Having replaced the old box with the remastered update, I am committed to this Anda cycle. Even so, it has limitations.<br /><br />Natural Mozartians are rare. If one speaks to pianists, many of them are wary of the little man because of the transparency of his writing, let alone giving effect to the kaleidoscope; it's so much easier to rampage up and down the keyboard in Liszt like a Pamplona bull. To my ears, Anda is to the manner born: he's the raison d'être of this set. His playing is incisive, poetic and dramatic by turns. He is deeply alive to Mozart the opera composer who so frequently appears in these miracles. There's no clink of Dresden China. With one exception, I prefer him utterly over the likes of Schiff, Ashkenazy and Uchida (who is sovereign in her K 488 with the ECO).<br /><br />Sadly Anda is saddled with an ordinary orchestra. I can't imagine that anyone has the Salzburg Mozarteum Camerata Academic on a pedestal (especially as they were back in the Sixties): they sound like Ma and Pa Kettle's barnyard band. The strings lack torque and finesse whereas the woodwind, so critical in Mozart, is devoid of plenitude. Man they are ordinary! I cannot think of a single bar where incandescence is theirs. On occasions, however, Anda's greatness masks their infelicities - and there are moments when they are acceptable enough. Perhaps having a conductor would've mitigated matters somewhat - alas it was not to be.<br /><br />While DG remastered this cycle with their Original Image Bit Processing, thereby adding spatial depth, there's only so much one can do with these recordings. They sound ancient of days.<br /><br />Here are some vignettes - where I have not listed some concertos, assume they are three star jobs:<br /><br />K 37 is a pastiche composition by the young Mozart for concert-use. There are much worse piano concertos in the world. Anda plays it with &eacute;lan and the SMCA do what they can. Five stars and what fun!<br /><br />K 175 - Mozart wrote three piano concertos in D Major and my favourite is this little pocket-rocket. Sadly, there's little magic in the slow movement; the soloist is absolved.<br /><br />K 238 - again, the slow movement is vin ordinaire. It's almost the nadir of the set.<br /><br />K 271 - a stellar performance. As much as possible, all participants are in fine form (and this statement holds true for any of the concertos recorded in the April 1969 sessions). Five stars and out of the park!<br /><br />K 413 - a superb performance and the recording is fuller than usual. Five stars.<br /><br />K 414 - the great pantheistic hymn of the slow movement is spoiled by the crudities of the SMCA, albeit counterbalanced by the mastery from the keyboard. Three stars but it should have been higher.<br /><br />K 449 - I have no problem if someone says to me, &#34;Bernard you dunderhead, when are you going to understand that K 449 is Mozart's greatest concerto by a wide margin!&#34; Anda is superlative in this work and it's regrettable that the orchestra and DG's engineers are unable to match his excellence. Four stars nevertheless.<br /><br />K 453 - to my ears, the best G Major on the market. Anda `encompasses this masterpiece like Magellan. Five stars easily.<br /><br />K 456 - the usual limitations apply but it's still a five stars performance overall.<br /><br />K 459 - the SMCA are damned ordinary in the finale. Four stars.<br /><br />K 466 - the SMCA are unable to bring anything minatory to the table in this work. Anda is a barnstormer in the slow movement's G Minor interlude - wow. Three stars overall.<br /><br />K 467 - Forget the hype - the soloist aside this is an ordinary performance. Three stars.<br /><br />K 482 & K 488 - the strings of the SMCA impart more torque than usual in these works though the woodwind remains pedestrian and that's deadly in these two masterpieces. Anda cannot quite match Uchida's brio in the finale of K 488. Four stars and that's being a tad generous.<br /><br />K 503 - as one listens to this Olympian utterance, one is never persuaded that this performance is the Word. Three stars (and much the same could be said of K 491 and the Coronation).<br /><br />K 595. A superlative account and to my ears, a worthy contender to Gilels. Anda captures its valedictory nature to perfection.<br /><br />So all in all, it's a curate's egg - but what a curate!5. A superlative account and to my ears, a worthy contender to Gilels. Anda captures its valedictory nature to perfection.  So all in all, it's a curate's egg - but what a curate!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!!! I read it in 2 days. I'm not a big reader. I could not put it down. Had to finish it before i saw the movie.
0307949508|5.0|I loved the book and the characters. The narrative is so realistic that I feel that these are people I actually got to know. I hope they  figure things out with the other books Larsson was planning to publish, because I want to know the end of the story! (not that this first book doesn't have a good end)
B0072PUC7W|2.0|I'm a huge fan of ASOT, I've been following it for the last 5 years, but something about this one just really upsets me. Especially disc two, every single song sounds exactly the same from the last. They all have the same 5th and 7th chord progressions that are truly, in my opinion, overused and abused. It's as if Bach and Mozart came out of the grave and got ahold of Gaybleton & Pro Fools, and started writing a ton of baroque trance, sent it to Armin, ending up on ASOT 2012.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Armin, and I will always support him because of what he does, but I thought 2012 was supposed to be the year of the new sound in trance and progressive (where is the progressive in 2012? I barely notice it!)<br /><br />I wish the track selection had more songs by artists like Omnia, who by the way does a killer job on the intro track. I expected Orjan to have released a great tune, instead, he released a rather mediocre beat that sounds like everything else on Disc 2.<br /><br />Personally, ASOT 2010 and 2011 were amazing because there was more variety in the trance styles. In 2012, it's like everyone was hanging out one night having a few drinks, and then they all decided unanimously to produce the same exact songs. 2012 was supposed to be the YEAR OF TRANCE. Instead, if feels like the YEAR OF LAME (of course, not as lame as FDR's legs...).<br /><br />Love you Armin, forever.<br /><br />-j
0674049160|5.0|The annotated Pride and Prejudice was a lot of fun to read, as well as informative.  I'm not entirely certain annotations are the way to go for a first read of this classic, but I had a lot of fun re reading with them.  Patricia Meyer Spacks has a great writing style for the annotations.  What could be simply dry historical pieces of information are in fact informational bits of dry sarcasm.  Reading them gave me the impression of having an intelligent friend peer over my shoulder periodically and make some quip about whatever I had just read.  Jane Austen's own nasty dry humor was also explained, giving the novel that much more depth.<br /><br />I found the content regarding the social rules and conventions of the time particularly helpful for Pride and Prejudice.  While I am not completely uninformed on that subject, it was helpful to know more about what Austen meant when she said a character was being condescending, or civil, as these have different connotations now.  Commentary on the war between Britain and France that was happening during the novel but never mentioned was also both surprising and interesting.  The idea that even the best of characters don't seem to care or that even those interested in the military seemed to hardly know their country was at war gives the whole thing an odd twist.<br /><br />There were quite a few topics in the annotated Pride and Prejudice that were worthy of further thought.  Spacks clearly knew her stuff, and I hardly minded that her additions doubled the length of the book.  Also, it is a very nice edition, with one of those weirdly soft, almost fuzzy papers for the cover.  Of course, it was much too large and lovely to carry around for light reading in a waiting room, which also slowed the pace of my reading.  Clearly, this book was meant to be savored, and that is precisely what I did with it.  If that is your goal in reading Jane Austen, I highly recommend this book.  For a quick read, skip the annotations, but be sureto check out the great pictures.
B00004Z459|5.0|Brand new! was as decribed . came very fast.  in excellent condition.  highly recommend to another person.  Wass better than i expected.  great cd.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am actually quite surprised at all the bad reviews. yes, the book is very repititious and the writting is not very good but I loved the story. Love all three!
B003KRJNBW|2.0|If you really get excited about post-apocalyptic ambiance, and just need a spiritual stroll through the wasteland, this is your film. However, if you're looking for something with a deeper plot and better story, look elsewhere (this is nowhere near a Mad-Max type film and leans more towards the... born-again.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Its a captivating read and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.  Books could be a little cheaper. Seeing how the content is not bound and not on paper why is the price the same as a paperback?
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|As a whole album, this is my favorite from top to bottom since Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. He stated that he wanted to \\"go backwards.\\" And that is a perfect description of this album. Great old school feel to it that even someone as young as I can appreciate.

B007MU85D0|5.0|Not usually apt to write an album review - but I honestly enjoyed this album. I heard them perform live on CD101's (They called it that when I lived in Columbus) Big Room, which piqued my interest. And for the price of a beer or two, I'm happy to report it's a very solid album.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is awesome!!!!!! and anyone who doesn't get it is a disgrace to draw something lovers! I saw it when Ellen talked about it on her show and was very disappointed when it wasn't on kindle but now it is! now we need temple run!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|THIS IS gun to play with with my kids. they like making their pictures silly. easy to upload to fb too so that's a big plus
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it I would not say I love it yet agen its me I play it whenever I am bored I think it needs to explain how you play a game before you actually play it I guess that would be better and a little more help
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I bought this dvd for the online content for my new kindle fire.<br /><br />They STOLE this from me.  This video is no longer available for online viewing or download.<br /><br />Now my options are to either pirate it or rebuy it. I'm going to pirate it because I already paid for it.<br /><br />This is exactly why people pirate things... because it's too hard to buy things legally and then have them yanked away from you.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Hunger Games started out with an amazing amount of promise. I'll even go so far as to call the first half of the book a classic. It's semi-futuristic, dystopian vibe was on par with that of 1984. Not only that, but the pervading sense of helplessness and hopelessness sitting juxtapose to such a dark and gritty event as the Hunger Games elevated it to be the most refreshing and thought-provoking novels I've read in over a decade.<br /><br />That promise, though, was quickly squandered. The climax of the book happened merely halfway through with the action and intensity reaching its peak at the start of the games. What followed was a slow, dreary walk in the woods occasionally punctuated by a brief and trivial encounter with other tributes. Not to mention her decision to succumb to the tastes of love-starved high school girls and tweens alike and force a love story that was best left omitted.<br /><br />What was worst, though, the thing that I felt best illustrated the incredible promise was the ending, an ending which addressed the complex, intriguing and ultimately heartbreaking ethical dilemmas with nauseating cliche's and cheap plot devices. In the end, her book failed to conclude these ethical dilemmas that made Hunger Games such an incredible book in the first place. Want my ending? Here it is.<br /><br />Following the death of Kato and the rise of the artificial sun, Katniss and Peeta have won. But no, the announcer has just proclaimed that he was, in fact, kidding about kidding and they'd have to kill each other. With the hopelessness of the situation put in full perspective as well as their depressing helplessness against the tyranny of the capitol, Peeta expresses one more time the desire that he's communicated to KAtniss throughout the story. \\"I wan't them to know that they don't own me\\".<br /><br />With that, Peeta climbs to his feet, takes his knife, looks defiantly into the cameras and slits his own throat. That incites rebellion and along come the sequels. The end.
B007BLEKPM|5.0|Great movie for history.  There a lot of items in the movie that I did not know about J. Edgar.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool and a good game however it gets boring after a little while and some of the games are hard to unlock.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book,a lot better than the movie! It catches your interest right from the start, i would recomend this to everyone.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Pooh on all the negative reviews when this is up against Tom Cruise and his predictable Mission Implausable installment.  Other than the too-stupid-to-believe incident when Kate Beckinsale meets up with some plastic, this is a good movie.  Because it offers characters like Ribisi, Caleb Landry Jones (who was outstanding), Ben Foster (also very good), and David O'Hara in a mix of bad guys that doesn't seem normal, it still works.  There are lots of unexpected turns.  Ribisi is a different bad guy.  Creepier than most, but less violent than most.  It's not a typical action film because the writers and director of this film are not American.  I loved it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app daily, it is super convienent. I don't t know why people are complaining that there are no maps because I have the map feature. It must have been corrected since then.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|It is clear so you can show off your white iPhone and it fits perfectly! It also comes with the screen protector, which is easy to apply, no bubbles whatsoever. Nevertheless, it's great quality and inexpensive. Who needs otterbox? Not me!
B002TQKS14|5.0|This book investigates the current industrialisation of food production and points out the benefits and difficulties of the organic production methods.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is going to be hard to replace.....I don't even know what to read after this. I loved this book. AMAZING READ!....covered everything sad happy angry....not so much funny. Even if you don't read often - read this book. Your welcome!
B007OUFESC|4.0|I think this might not appeal to a \\"mainstream\\" audience, especially if you compare it to the \\"usual\\" dreck one sees in movie trailers in the US in recent years (nothing but over-the-top special effects and gratuitous violence, with this-could-never-happen plots). As a psychologist, I had a special interest in the characters, and therefore enjoyed it very much.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|With the 5th of their \\"core 7\\" albums from their glory days with \\"A Question Of Balance\\", The Moody Blues mission this time around was to record music in the studio that they could more easily duplicate on stage.  Thus, this Moodies album is not as complex in production as their previous album \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\" from 1969 (which I consider to be my favorite of their \\"core 7\\" albums), but as with previous projects, one track slides effortlessly into the next.  Furthermore, the opening track \\"Question\\" remains as one of the Moodies classic hits, and to this very day is always the second to last performed song at their concerts.  Their creative genius flows on all the remaining tracks as well, and if you can obtain this CD with the six additional bonus cuts over and above the original LP content of 10 songs, that alone makes this updated version of \\"A Question of Balance\\" worth acquiring. \\"Mike's Number One\\" is the best bonus track included here. This CD is another must have for the devout Moodies fan.<br /><br />Now how about getting these guys inducted at long last into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame?  Long overdue!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I Love this person. I have been looking for this CD for a while and found it cheap here....Super Fast shipping,within 2 days:) Overall great!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|At just over two hours, this movie feels a bit long.<br /><br />Other than that, Courageous is the best yet from Alex Kendrick and Sherwood Pictures.<br /><br />First we had a used car salesman, then a football coach. Next came Kirk Cameron and the firefighters and now we have police officers.<br /><br />Like a television sitcom from the 90s, the main theme of this movie is handed to you in a very obvious way early on - this story is about being a good dad. The focus is on four officers who must deal with how to be good dads. Many of the plot lines are telegraphed early. There won't be the twists in many of today's films but this movie is actually quite solid.<br /><br />The acting is great. (Coming from Sherwood Pictures this is amazing!) The humor had me laughing out loud multiple times. (I loved the Snake King in the back of the police car!) I really liked how they dealt with the father and his teenage daughter. It was your typical, \\"she likes a not-so-good boy\\" and with her dad not agreeing with the relationship until trust is earned, I was expecting a brooding, hostile teen. But the father/daughter scene in the restaurant was exactly how it should go.<br /><br />Unlike Facing the Giants in which everyone got what they wanted in the end, this movie has some real-life consequences. Not everyone gets what they want.<br /><br />I was impressed about everything in this film. It just proves that you can make a fantastic movie without having to resort to graphic nudity or language. While God, church, and Jesus are mentioned and they do come up in conversations, the religious aspect didn't feel shoved in my throat. It may have been that I knew what it was coming into the movie so it didn't catch me off guard.<br /><br />This is simply a 4-star movie with great lessons for dads in our society. A guilt trip? No, simply a call to integrity.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I am enjoying this game.  There are multiple levels in each &quot;world &quot; or episode.  Lots to explore.  It took forever to download the &quot;resources &quot;, at least partially due to our wick by satellite,  but also because it was over 300mb.  Anyway it is worth the wait.
0345803485|1.0|If I could give this book 5+ negative stars I would.<br /><br />It is horribly written, she uses the same words on the page over and over again (amongst other things).<br /><br />The lead character is supposed to be a 22 year old graduating college who never got drunk, held hands, or kissed a boy- ok fine- I would have believed that. Until the author (in a book that was supposed to be taking place at a college in 2011) wrote that the main character didn't have an e-mail address. WHAT? I am 29 in 2012 and I had an email address in 1997 via AOL. You get an email address at college- in fact, you do much of you work via email in college- I know that because I graduated college in 2005 (6 years after this book allegedly takes place). Come ON! At least do some research if you're writing a novel- that goes for the author and editors.<br /><br />I've read romances before- never before has there also been so much unbelievable sex. Seriously- 4x in like 3 hours? This isn't science fiction. At least drag it out- is that even possible?<br /><br />Towards the end, I just wanted to stab Ana in the eye for being such an unbelievable, utter, loser. I was hoping their glider plane would crash and burn and then have new characters with a good story.<br /><br />I have NO idea why this book is so popular, except that it has a lot of unbelievable sex and un-relatable characters- are people this desperate?<br /><br />If you watch Desperate Housewives, Jersey Shore or the Kardashians, this is probably a good read for you, if not, I urge you to not waste your time!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really fun and awesome a really good game when you get borde I would really recommend this every one should get it
B007MNV5WU|4.0|when is the kindle fire going to update their apps I have an ipad and I have this game on there and the new map is already out but on kindle fire its not ........what the hell kindle!!!!
B002T921DE|3.0|I am a big GM fan and overall happy with this blu-ray purchase. The only things that bothered me was:<br /><br />1) Shoot The Dog (one of my favorite songs) was edited from being a 5 minute song, down to less than 2 minutes! During the actual concert, George played the entire version of the song. It was only edited for blu-ray and DVD. I was very disappointed!<br /><br />2) During some of the songs, George relied on the audience to sing parts of his songs. I am all for the audience singing along WITH George Michael, but he would stop singing and let the fans do the singing for him. It was very noticeable during Careless Whisper (probably his most famous song). IMO, it actually ruined the song.<br /><br />Other then that, the Blu-Ray was great. I enjoyed the behind the scenes footage of George and his band. That was probably the best part of this disc.
0345803507|5.0|Once I started this series, I couldn't put it down til I finished it. Took me a week to get through the series, but is worth the time. Luckily, this last book answers so many nagging questions, and sums up the series very nicely. You go away happy you read it, then want to start all over again with the first book. These two people's feelings for each other are so intriguing, that you just want to delve into their subconscious and pull out more. I loved how at the end of the book, we do get an inner look of Christen's thoughts. Until he told Ana some things, toward the end, it is always a mystery exactly what he is thinking.  All and all, this book has a lot of sex, but it's more about Christen Grey's inner torment, and how the love of one woman frees him. I highly recommend it.

It's a safe way to experience this Hot Sexy Stuff<br />without actually doing it.  If I met this guy I'm sure I would have run the other way... would not have have missed the whole damned thing.  This way I get to be part of the excitement and am spared the intimidation.<br />Old Dog learning New Tricks

0817439390|5.0|The exposure triangle is something I have been mystified by for a long time!  So long, in fact, that I thought it was futile for me to even try to understand it anymore.  I had read articles, gone through tutorials, thought it through til my brain was frazzled, and I still remained clueless.  I was looking for books to explain it, but was afraid I'd just be wasting money on something that didn't give me anything more than the free tutorials.  That is, until someone suggested this book by Bryan Peterson.  I'll confess, I was secretly a little bit skeptical as to whether I could really grasp this concept or not, but I decided to give it a try.  I am SO glad I did!!!  It is the most practical, easy to understand, down to earth explanation I have ever read.  The seemingly impossible task of shooting in manual mode is now a reality, and I actually understand WHY and WHEN to change the settings to WHAT. : )  I'm tickled to death and would recommend this book to anyone!
0451197968|4.0|Another well-written book by King. I have one main criticism. DON'T READ the introductory section \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" until you finish the novel. King writes the MOTHER of all spoilers there. And it's not just a vague reference to one of many events in the novel. It's SPECIFIC information about THE ENDING. Why King would have done this is completely baffling, but he clearly was giving no thought to his readers.
0345803485|1.0|Was this book written by a bona fide novelist, or by a teenage boy hiding under the covers with a flashlight?  The irony to me is that many of the women who are going ga-ga over this book would eschew reading a quality historical romance novel, where the sex scenes are so much hotter because the characters are authentic and the story is thoughtful and intricate.  Reading this book felt more like voyeurism into the windows of a sick sadist and a co-dependent weakling with serious self-esteem issues.  The final turn in the story was improbable and only written as such to segue to the sequel.<br /><br />My daughter is a clinical psychologist.  She might be interested in reading this book from a psychological perspective, but most likely she has already encountered emotionally broken personalities in her practice.
0765365278|1.0|This is not a good book. I am not one to trash books that others clearly enjoy, however the fact that people are giving reviews of four or five stars forces my hand.<br />There are other negative reviews and all of them make salient and accurate points that I am not going to repeat. I implore you to read them.<br />It is my humble opinion that the embarrassing sycophancy on show by Sanderson fans in rating this book highly is destroying the fantasy genre. Take 'Ice and Fire' by Martin, the Malazan book of the Fallen series by Erikson or works by Joe Abercrombie.  All great books with interesting characters and a story line that invites you to invest emotionally.  This book does not do that.  By giving this book anything other than one star you are suggesting it is on a par with the other works just named. It is not. If I were just getting in to fantasy and I bought this based on reviews I would forever assume the whole genre was full of overly long, intensely dull and poorly written books about ...... well, nothing. If this is worth 4.5 stars then how bad must the rest of the genre be?<br />You get the point.<br />I can honestly say that I will never read another Sanderson book. If it weren't for the fact that I already know Erikson, Abercrombie and Martin I would never read another fantasy novel either.
B005D63RQK|4.0|The show is one of the most entertaining I have seen in a long time.  The video quality was average so if you want better quality you will have to pay a little extra for the HD version.  In my opinion the HD should be lower priced and amazon should not even bother selling the non-HD version.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this series of books have me totally captivated. i love how we can feel the changes happening in each character and how this author just makes us wants to keep turning the pages. as i wrote after the review of book one gotta go have a book to read. the worst part about that thought is there is no book 4. i hope one is coming
B0055SWM08|1.0|seems like every other memory game or test. why is it number one. how is it good. it doesnt seem speciql
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|A great day for music. The labor of love displayed by the many musicians comes thru in the performances. The inclusion of members from the original Temptations (Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin) with Hall & Oates was special for me. Queen, Mick Jagger and Tina Turner: Rocked the house. Highly recommend this set for anyone who appreciates Rock and Rock, Soul and Rythm and Blues music. This is a \\"must have\\" for any music collection.  There are performances for everyone to enjoy and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members to see (Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and BB King). Long Live Rock!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|cool game. wish u did not have to pay a dollar for no ads though.. wish colors and bokbs did not cost so many coins.

B003OUXECE|4.0|You Mr. Shirley are.........are a class act. Kudos Mr. Shirley ......kudos indeed. Quite enjoyable for a fan of the Bioshock series, but that is also it's greatest flaw unfortunately ; the book will fail as a stand alone read , people who are unfamiliar with \\"Bioshock\\" will find the reading quite bizarre and lacking detail , but if you've played both games, it will be enjoyable and fill the story gaps of the game quite nicely. Excellent for a game adaptaion.

0062119044|4.0|Kevin is a teenager who has killed several people at his local high school and is now serving time in jail.  His mother Eva tells the story of Kevin's life through a series of letters to her absent husband, Franklin.  She is using the letters as a way to analyze Kevin's life, the potential mistakes that she made as a mother, and the warning signs that she perhaps may have missed.  It is also a book about parenting, about the traits that children inherit from their parents and the way that children affect your relationship with your spouse.<br /><br />Eva is a formidably intelligent narrator and is ruthless in her self assessment.  It's a highly readable book, with lots to think about and a growing sense of dread as she builds up towards talking about the events on the day when Kevin embarked on his killing spree.  Parts are very disturbing to read and it's not the kind of book that you will forget easily.<br /><br />Where it didn't really work for me is the \\"nature vs nuture\\" argument.  It seems apparent from the get go that Kevin is innately evil and has been since birth.  In fact, at about the three quarter mark I was getting tired of reading about Kevin's relentless villainy.  We are flogged round the head with it - although as Eva admits, she is perhaps biased in her mindset and there are occasions when her assumptions about Kevin are wrong.  So perhaps you can argue that he isn't as evil as his mother makes out, but the case seems pretty clear cut.  So if this is true - if despite a loving father, good home and caring teachers, Kevin was always destined to do something terrible - isn't the question of his mother's influence somewhat irrelevant?<br /><br />Nevertheless it's a very good book, which is very thought provoking.
0439023521|5.0|Great book! Keeps the reader engaged till the end! I wouldn't recommend for children under 13. The 2nd book is even better but I feel the third book lacks a little.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|the best Broadway show ever.<br />I love the music, the story, the scenes.<br />Especially good on this DVD - all the Phantoms came out to sing at the end (except Michael Crawford).<br />Otherwise, it is a perfect night.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I didn't first want this game but my sister bought it for me and after playing it, was really kind of fun after my friend showed me things that I could do on it which games to get.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book of the Hunger Games trilogy maintains the same \\"voice\\" as the others, which might or might not get on your nerves, but you cannot discount the power of the story... Loved it and grateful to my daughter for the recommendation to read all three...<br /><br />No I haven't seen the movie and not sure I care if I do, because the books provided all the visuals any reader could want.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ive been wating for this for months.I tried asking. Now the wait is over. I love it. Now I can play with my aunt
B003YWUTKM|1.0|Very much a waste of money, i expected alot more here.  Wouldve like to have heard just electronics and guitar, no vocals.....GARBAGE...........................
B004SIP8W0|5.0|if you enjoyed schindler's list i think you will like this a lot too. detailing about compassion and humanity in the face of overwhelming inhumanity and cruelty. if you're looking to buy a film, you're backing a cert. with this.
B001AQO41E|4.0|I've always loved this movie but never owned it.  Finally, I purchased it in blu-ray and so glad I did.  It's awesome!  I would say it's becoming a classic and it's a great story with great actors and with great special effects.  Definitely, a MUST have for your collection.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|There's really nothing creative or fun about this. You don't even need to play the game to see that it's a blatant rip off of the original Mario Bros games, except a lot less entertaining.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that it's a blatant rip off, the actual game play is overly simplistic and the music is the same 5 to 10 seconds on repeat.<br /><br />I wonder if this would still have such a high rating if the creator charged money for this game. If you're looking for a good time waster, there are plenty of other free games on the appstore...
B004TI5N38|3.0|as a huge fan of both Lee Child and David Baldacci, i was hesitant to read this book because of the similarity between Baldacci's Puller and Child's long time hero Reacher. [the reviews which discuss this are right on] as always, this book is well written [Baldacci may just be my favorite author], but i would still be Team Reacher. i am hoping that Child and Baldacci are great friends and are working on a joint book to, possibly, reveal that Reacher and Puller are long-lost brothers, separated at birth. the two of them together on a mission of redemption and destruction would get an automatic 5 stars!! *hint hint*  :)
1439107955|5.0|I think the title tells it all. I've not anything more profound then many of the reviewers here have said. Except the book was a page turner for me. The drama, and despair of learning you have a terrible disease is clearly presented. The chase for more knowledge of cancer is taken up by doctors and scientist over the years, the evolution of treatment is very fascinating, at times exciting, and suspenseful. I think this book is masterful, and a great read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game was amazing! At first I was looking for a Mario game and couldn't find one so then I found this game and it's just like Mario! So it works out perfectly!!!!!!!
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|\\"You shouldn't think of her as being a woman. That would be a mistake.\\" After freeing a Chinese journalist that is being held hostage black-ops government agent Mallory (Carano) is double-crossed. She has now become a target of highly skilled assassins who are sent to get rid of her. She must use all of her skills to fight her way through them and discover who was behind the double-cross. I was looking forward to this one based on the exciting preview. The movie started off good enough but very quickly began to drag and made me lose interest throughout. Some of the dialog is laughable and the music cues consisted of a 5 measure sequence ripped off from \\"Ocean's 11\\". At first it was neat but began to get annoying. Even though Carano is an MMA fighter in real life the fight sequences looked very choreographed and for an action movie it wasn't really all that exciting. All that said though if you liked \\"Salt\\" or \\"Columbiana\\" you will most likely like this one too. Not terrible but not original at all. Overall, a movie that is best described as Salt 6 - after \\"Hanna\\", \\"Columbiana\\", \\"Cat Run\\", etc...I give it a B-.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is one of the best steampunk hidden object apps! 7 beautiful levels and very challenging! I am loving this game! Its a must have!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game I play it nonstop I think everybody should have I just wish they would have super Mario bros on the amazon. store anyway this is why I rate it five star
B005S9EJZA|5.0|The German Shepherd in this film is a dog who failed protection dog training and was then trained by Boone's Animals For Hollywood.  His real name is Rowdy.  The Shepherd appears throughout the movie, playing the part of Logan Thibault's (the main character) companion.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I'm so glad they finally released this the Kindle Fire! Its a great game that all will love.  Especially if you like Pictionary and Words with Friends. You should get this now! Guaranteed fun for all.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I just love S. King. And this topic of time holes and the butterfly effect is so unsettling and so possible and so S. King.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is ABOUT TIME that the Amazon appstore got this app. They still need to step up their game though. I won't be satisfied until Temple Run gets added. Anyways, this is a pretty fun app, but I kinda thought more than just two players could participate in a single round...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this is a really good game and I think the animals are great! You have to get this game.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is a pretty fun app, and I instantly found it addicting after I downloaded it. With that being said, sometimes while I'm playing, the whole screen will just randomly turn black except for a tiny part at the top. I don't know what the problem is with that, but please look into it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|this game is super fun but you have to wait a long time for energy and others things unless you pay extra for them.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|I lost every thing even my glu credits not happy the game was really good but froze at level 22 then i lost everything not cool glue
1439190275|4.0|Great presentation of the Atkins method, with real life stories that really help understand how it can help. Looks like it works, and planning to start it shortly.
630463949X|5.0|If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, this concert will be right up your alley. We have been watching this concert on VHS for years, and the DVD really helps to step up the sound and audio quality. There are no special features or commentary, but the concert itself is a great one. They play all of the fan favorites, have a little bit of dialogue on stage, and even have a guest appearance by the USC marching band. The passion of the songs really come out as Stevie and Lindsey  communicate non-verbally on stage during songs like Silver Springs. If you enjoy the older Fleetwood Mac songs, this DVD is for you. The other benefit is that since it is from the late 90s, the band was in much better form than they are now.<br />Highly Recommend!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is really fun and addicting. There are some problems, however. I'm having major trouble with the Friends/Neighbors aspect.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It feels like I've been waiting forever!  I'm Super Super excited! I can't wait to tell everybody! When I received the email notifying me of the app I thought it was a joke.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Its about time that Draw Something came to Amazon! I love this game. It is great for the Kindle Fire's large screen
B00785P2QC|4.0|I only run out of money, which can be easily regained with time. not a super revolutionary game,  but quite interesting and slightly addictive.

B007Q2N0HA|2.0|Bared To You did not work for me, it read like a painful obsession not a romance.  Normally I don't mind a first person narrative but when it comes to romance it is a major turn off for me. Romance is like the Tango, it takes two to tango anything less is just one person going through the motions. I read romance to experience the H/h inner thoughts, motivation and desires that make them attractive to the other person. I want to know the reason behind why they do the things they do to get their love interest. When you've got a guy as HOT as Gideon Cross I want more than just a man in a suit as an object of desire, I want to know what is going on in his head as he pursues Eva. To me that is the difference between an emotional romance and a sterile romance. I became bored quickly with just reading about Eva's feelings and thoughts, they were intense but I can only imagine how more enjoyable it would have been if I knew what Gideon was thinking during the push/pull of their relationship. For example, the scene when they make love for the first time and she is given the silent treatment immediately after, we experience what is going in Eva's head, her feelings of hurt and rejection but we are given no information on Gideon. What is he thinking as he pushes Eva away after a very emotional moment for both of them.  I need to know if this guy is just a jackass or maybe he just might have a valid reason no matter how screwy for doing the things he does.  I need the words and thoughts as well as the action by the characters to invest my time in them.<br /><br />Reading about how mesmerized Eva was by Gideon's beauty got old real quick; it was like listening to your girl-friend go on and on about how good her boyfriend is in bed.  After a while you tune her out and all you hear is yada, yada, yada.  I got it the first time, Gideon is H. O. T....geez..  I know this is suppose to be a serious romance about a dysfunctional couple, but OMG I laughed so hard when Eva freaked out over Gideon taking her to his fpad for a quickie.  That was the beginning of the end for me with this book. The misunderstandings between the H/h were crazy stupid. I started skim reading and skipping some of the sex scenes just to finish the book.<br /><br />I like dysfunctional dark characters unfortunately I could not get into Eva and Gideon. When I should have been thoughtful and sympathetic to their relationship I found humor and laughed a lot while reading their story. Not sure if I will read the next book in this series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its the best game I have ever played but something that would make it better is if you would get a million coins after you reach rank 11
B005SFR7YE|5.0|It is high time the stage caught up and is selling DVD's of actual performances.  When leaving the theatre in London in 1986, having watched the original cast, I would love to have brought home with me a copy of the production.  I have yet to understand why the stage performances are not to be recorded.  It seems a ready source of income and there are areas where live theatre never has a place to perform.  The DVD of \\"Phantom\\" is wonderful but quite different from the version I saw so many years ago.  Many more special effects and a huge cast.  However, the music remains as special as it was then.<br />I am looking forward to USA theatre getting the message.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have had this on my android for a while now. Today I was finally able to get it on the Kindle Fire!! It is so fun and addicting. I just signed in with my email and password and my game transfered from my cell app to my kindle app. I enjoy the bigger screen on the kindle as well. You must play this!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Used this for some serial communication between two computers. No issues, works exactly as its supposed to. Would highly recommend this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is amazing. Everyday I play this game. I always play this game when I'm sad happy mad or any emotion. You should get this game its really really 1000000000 more times fun.so get this game and you'll be amazed.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this app forever!! Its an amazing game were you can draw and talk to people. 6/5 stars!! &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this is a pretty fun game.  There are a lot of interesting puzzles.  The story keeps you engaged.  Good graphics, looks great on the Kindle Fire.
0525478817|5.0|A student recommended that I read this book & I am so glad I did.  I love the emotional levels of the novel.  Green has done a wonderful job of taking a tragic situation and bringing hope, humor and humanity to it.  I read a lot, and about once a year a book takes my breath away.  The Fault In Our Stars is that book for 2012.
B005D51JQQ|5.0|I remember when friends would talk of a new art print they had just purchased, or a beautiful book of images, sometimes numbered, sometimes not. This collection reminds me of that. The music sounds full, lush, and warm. The book? Fantastic in it's well thought out layout and content. In an age where many people feel no concern for paying for an artists hard work then complaints run rampant, I'll choose to take part in this. Congrats Mr. Sting. Fantastic work...
B007NYO74Q|1.0|A realistic depiction of neurotic strangers brought together by unfortunate happenstance (their kids get in a fight).  If your idea of entertainment is watching 80 minutes of banal arguing rent this.  Or better yet... pick from an endless variety of reality TV garbage that would be equal in production quality available for free on cable and save the rental for something worthwhile.
B001NLCBJI|4.0|It's that simple.  There are no crash, boom, transformers running after people.  This film is not going to plead for your attention.  It simply presents itself and you get on the train and engage your self, or you decide to get off the train movie.  It's not for everyone.  If you know youre a person who prefers a high activity, high paced, snatch your senses film - skip this one.  If you appreciate Japapnese Culture, cinematography or 'deep' movies that you have to experience - try it out.  I think a lot of people get thrown by the fact that Bill Murray is in it, and it's not a comedy. The truth (to me) is this movie will only make sense to you if you have experienced (and recognized) what the actors are portraying.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I was on a trip and had extra time in airports and things, so it was perfect to read all of the stories.  Loved all of the interesting plots.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|does take a while to load but it is worth the wait.  Cant believe they only charge. 99 cent worth more I think the price will go up.  no worry about not understanding anything everything is explained. playing mine on a kindle fire and no problems.  beautiful graphics.  try it you'll love it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I just started playing it and its a cool game its not hard nor difficult. very funn I guess but so far its a good game to play
B007BRJYF2|5.0|no problem loading no problems playing fairly easy no really challenging things happening good to pass the time with..good little story line
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I downloaded the app this morning and have been playing it since(it's like 2pm now) I love drawing and it's even more fun when you add friends:D It's a great way to pass time and works GREAT with the fire! The only concern is how to remove people from your previous games, but other than that it's a blast!!:)))
B006X08FDA|5.0|The Carolina Chocolate Drops are awesome.  And this is another great CD.  I heard the group in concert several years ago.  Saw in the the movie The Great Debaters and have loved them since.  They are great performers and holders of a tradition of music that had been let go in the main stream.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.  it is great. I downloaded it thinking it was going to be dumb. but I cant stop playing. I love the games.!!!!!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|We purchased this pool for our 5 1/2 and 3 year old.  This pool is nice and large and has plenty of space for both of my kids to play and splash.  My husband has even spent some time in it with them and still left plenty of room to play.  The spray that comes out of the sides is a ton of fun and the slide is just right for my kids.  As I type they are outside sliding down it head first on their tummies and having a grand time.  It isn't depicted on the Amazon picture, but there is also a little inflatable landing pad at the base of the slide, which is a nice touch.  One thing I didn't realize when I ordered is that both pool areas have a drain on the bottom, which I was very pleased to see.  Most similar pools do not have that feature, so it was a pleasant surprise. There was a small hole in the bottom of the smaller area of the pool, but my kids played in it empty for a couple of days in the house before we filled it up outside so they could have caused that.  Even so, we didn't even patch it yet and the water level has remained fine despite the hole.  We do have a tarp under it so that may help...  The pool came with a patch so we will patch it up once it is dry so it doesn't get bigger, but I am not too concerned.  Any pool like this is going to end up with holes in the bottom in my opinion.  As long as the inflatable parts stay intact then I don't worry too much and so far it has held air great.  We are very happy with this purchase.  It was a reasonable price, especially considering the fun toys that come with it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ever since it came out on the iphone or ipod iv been wanting it on the kindle fire and now I got it! its so easy to draw because u know its a bigger screen
B006IDG2T6|4.0|'Free Will', which feels more like a pamphlet than a book, (in the way a novella and a novel are compared), is nonetheless an excellent beginning to a wide debate on multiple topics. Harris touches upon law, science and religion in his discussions, opening doors for further questioning. His example of a murder case is particularly insightful, namely in the various circumstances the murderer had the 'luck' to partake in. If the murder was committed due to a cancer in the brain, how does law enforcement react?<br />I'm all for the tangibility of a physical book, but I stress again to potential customers that the book is small. The Kindle version is significantly cheaper as of this writing. The book has large font, which my grandfather actually did enjoy. There's no sarcasm here.<br />Anyway, I recommend this read as a beginning to a large discussion about the nature of 'free will', especially to fans of Daniel Dennett, who don't seem to like the book very much at all. My views align more with Harris, so I have a bias here. I'm eagerly awaiting to see the exchange of ideas between these two great thinkers- fingers crossed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I tried using The Weather Channels app but it wasn't laid out as good as this one; everything is very detailed down to the hourly forecast, real time satellite images, and even the video forecasts.<br /><br />One of the best working apps out there.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is easier to get coins and you can win a lot from the parana pool<br />I love this game
B006KX3GXO|3.0|Its great for photo editing I love it. its just that I cant upload pictures so I have to go to my saved photos on my kindle and try to upload it to PicsArt.

0345803485|1.0|Teenagers can write better.  Seriously.  How pathetic.  So the only people who are into Sub/Dom lifestyles are ones that come from broken childhoods and divorced parents?  If you are a stay at home mother in your early 40's and your sex life is drowning I am sure this is a slight pick me up and isn't that a bit sad.  It really is Twilight for adults, incredibly sad that authors can't seem to write real characters anymore.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Wonderful movie, I'm totally satisfied.<br />We can have a good perspective about what it was the cultural revolution in rural China; it is a love story not a political movie nevertheless it has strong historical content with an indirect political message.
B0075564A8|5.0|At the time this movie came out, there was simply no one bigger than Madonna - she was the hottest star on the planet...an unstoppable phenomenon that no one could come close to touching. \\"Truth of Dare\\" brilliantly captures Madonna at the peak of her brilliance, beauty and bitchiness while giving the world a glimpse of the superstar's life. It was the first time we saw behind the polished, tightly-controlled image she had perfected and got to see what was ultimately a shallow, lonely woman whose life's passion appeared to be more, more, more and me, me, me. But I absolutely LOVE this movie. While \\"Truth of Dare\\" did not make me like Madonna as a person, we finally see her interact with her very real family, staff and \\"friends,\\" although I seriously doubt she has real friends. This film is incredibly entertaining on so many levels and, as always, she is years ahead of the world, in light of the subsequent obsession with reality programming.  I do not like the person and entertainer Madonna later became but I was absolutely fascinated by the woman she was in \\"Truth of Dare,\\" as she was a bona fide superstar in the middle of her mind-bogglingly successful career. Never a classy or gracious woman, Madonna cusses like a truck driver throughout this movie but it really doesn't matter since you'll also see her in action on and off the stage, being her formerly gorgeous, enigmatic, charming, riveting and captivating self.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|had fun for about a week but glitch has left me waiting DAYS before i can collect anything again. this was second install of game after trying once before and ended with the same issue. thats it. im out.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is a fun game for the whole family. After I play it I feel liked that my children like it as well.<br />Now thank you for reading this review.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I got involved into the series after watching the movie and hoping the book was better due to some obvious shortcomings in the movie. After reading book 1 i felt the book was indeed better yet still a disappointment. The plot is interesting when initially set , but as the books advance its a downhill overuse of cliffhangers, predictable writing, and an attempt to create too much  empathy with the main character ended up ruining the series for me.<br /><br />This is still an interesting read, but i had heard good things from these and expected more. so i am reviewing these on high standards. Took about a week to read the full series, easy to read, recommended for teens and under.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. I play it like 24/7 I also love how User friendly it is made things a lot easier. I would love for everyone to play this it is so much easier than sims
B007V2UGPE|4.0|awesome game. I'm not a big fan of the coin system that it used. collecting these things is far to difficult and focing you to buy them to lvl up some of your characters. this is true for all of the games by glue but they are so much fun I over look this small flaw and enjoy the added difficulty of playing for free
0439023521|5.0|I was hooked almost immediately after I started reading the Hunger Games! I'm not an avid reader, but this book definitely grabbed my interest and I can't wait to finish reading the series!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|nice escape from the day that my kiddos can get involved in. wish it didnt tempt me to spend dollars.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is much better than the rest of this type. It doesn't depend heavily on paying for credits and has a lot to do.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun addicting set of games. keeps you playing to unlock new games. read reviews to realize you do not get all the games to start. for a free game I enjoy it
B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna is Queen of reinvention but she adds more of a personal touch to this CD. There are tunes that can be dance hits and there are songs that are so \\"soulful\\" and personal. I recommend this CD to the Madonna fan and perhaps to the newest fan. I really like \\"turn up the radio\\" and \\"sinner\\". The CD is basically a metaphorical utopia of lyrics that are so meaningful...her own MDNA!! Madonna is the pop Queen and always will be. Give this CD a try and let it be your own \\"masterpiece\\"!!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Just purchased this today on Blu Ray. Just started it now and all I can say is WOW. The opening credits are gorgeous and twisted. This is going to be one hell of a trilogy. I've never read the books nor seen the original trilogy but now I am very interested in both the books and original Swedish films. This is a dark, gloomy, sexual, top-notch thriller. This is what filmaking is supposed to be like. 10 stars for Finch, Craig and Mara.
B004VAERRC|4.0|I love Sparks' stories of love and loss. The Lucky One is a a sweet tale that left me disagreeing with just who Sparks' termed the \\"lucky one\\".
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is an amazing one. it has beautiful graphics and is really addictive. I would recommend it to everyone.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie. I enjoy it immensely.<br /><br />I am a huge baseball fan, but what I like most about the movie is the back story, the more human element of these baseball corporations.<br /><br />After watching the movie, I read the book and I was amazed how they were able to capture the soul of book without losing the facts or figures.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Recommend to read it first before going to see movie  I couldn't put down the book until finished through entire book. Loved it.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|After reading the previews I expected to be disappointed with this book. I am glad I read it and was far from disappointed. I loved it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|fantastic app! i just downloaded 75 pics from my Droid Charge to my laptop! easy, smooth and fantastic! absolutely no problems at all!
B0055SWM08|4.0|its an alright game. good execution though, no problems, great graphics!! its definitely a thinking game if your into that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app.  You can get so much out of it.  I enjoy reading along as the computer reads to me - it seems to help my focus on the subject.  There are all kinds of reading plans and and support aids.  It is amazing that it is free.
B002NJWHHA|2.0|The book has many details that should have been in the movie but weren't.  Things like having Arya actually look like an elf, there should have been dwarfs with the Varden, the Urgals didn't have any horns.  The storyline for the movie wasn't bad but it was poorly portrayed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|would recommend to peoples that love solitaire in the best forms. It can be basic or complex you are the one that gets to decide which makes things better and easier in my world.
B005HSL626|2.0|GRRRR!!!  I got this because all my friends on feint have it but I don't know how they play it.  Its boring.  All you have to do is drag your finger on the screen.  Waste of TIME.  DO NOT GET!!!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I have to say this book was amazing. I have read all the books in this series now and i can say the first is by far the best! if you like the sort of futuristic,adventure,young adult novel, i highly reccomend this book!
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I had to delete an extra 650 Mb on my kindle not 450 like it says so it could download and be played
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different types of games from shooting to puzzle solving. there is something for every type of game lover. I just wish getting new games didn't require so many points.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is cool! I just heard about it the day right before it came out on the Kindle fire. I was gonna search for it but I had to go to a wedding. So the next day I came to get an app and I saw this was the top rated app. You should get this its really fun!
0345803485|1.0|If I could give a rating of zero stars, I would. This was poorly written Twific (Google Masters of the Universe and get the PDF for free). I have lost all faith in the publishing world for allowing this drivel to see the light of day.<br /><br />Zero character development.<br /><br />Zero depth.<br /><br />Zero research on BDSM.<br /><br />The sex scenes are beyond bland and repetitive.<br /><br />I would rather read the dictionary. In Latin.

B00003CXB6|5.0|How many \\"the second\\" films have you seen that have fallen so short of the preceding movie you wish hadn't bothered? Not this time. The best way to explain the stellar film that is Lost World, is to describe it for what it is, Jurassic Park all grown up. The story line was clever and believable, but the special effects were unbelievable; unbelievably fantastic...so far beyond what you could imagine that seeing the film many times will still entertain and fascinate. If you only allow yourself to take a chance on one movie once in awhile, make this one your next choice. I've seen it several times and I STILL won't leave my seat....for any reason!

0486284735|5.0|This book lives up to what it is supposed to be--a classic love story.  I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth.  Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy.  I feel her love for her sister.  And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place.  This is a love story.  If you want to read a love story, read this book.  If you're not interested in that type of thing, then pass this up.  I promise you, though, that if you're interested in reading a simple love story, then this is a great one.

0545265355|3.0|I must admit, once starting this trilogy, I was instantly sucked in.  A couple chapters in, and there was no way I wouldn't finish the series.<br /><br />It started out strong.  Without giving too much away, I started out really admiring the main character, Katniss.  She's a strong girl and lives to care for her sister and family.  I rooted for her and wanted her to win at the Games.<br /><br />A new character was introduced--Peeta.  Peeta is the flattest major character I've encountered in a book in a long time.  There's absolutely no substance to him, and so I couldn't figure out why he was being featured so prominently in the books.  Then, a ridiculous, forced love story is concocted.  She has to pretend to love him... why?  She has to pretend to always be kissing him... why?  And I still don't really grasp why she actually had to pretend to be engaged to him, either.  It was just bizarre.  I couldn't swallow those ideas down.<br /><br />The further on the series went, the less I liked the main character.  Her family all but disappears from the books.  By the third book, even her best friend is basically hidden in the background.  The books begin to focus more on her feelings, thoughts, inner dialogue--even her dreams.  There are pages and pages of descriptions of her dreams and nightmares.  It's just dribble.  I found myself skimming through these parts to get back to the plot of the books.  Once something was happening, I got caught up in the books again, but I realized that I could no longer stand the main character.  She became completely unsympathetic.  She stopped thinking about and visiting her family and best friend.  She just moped around, thinking no one liked her and how she ruins everyone's lives.  She'd lead her two potential lovers on--first she'd tell them there's no way she could be with either of them, and then she'd be sleeping in one of their arms or making out with one in the woods.  She kept putting herself above everyone else.  I just couldn't stand her, and it's tough to really enjoy a book when you hate the protagonist!<br /><br />The books were OK.  They were definitely good in the sense that they suck you in right away.  On the other hand, they get worse and worse the further in them you get.  They're a lot like Twilight in that regard--and in regards to the love triangle.  Yes, this series is very much like Twilight.  Pick it up, enjoy them, but don't be surprised when things deteriorate as you get deeper into the series.'t stand her, and it's tough to really enjoy a book when you hate the protagonist!<br /><br />The books were OK.

B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bruce's new 'Wrecking Ball' is not an easy first listen because its a lyrical statement of bleakness and pessimism, much like the despairing, 1982 Reagan-era release 'Nebraska'.  Unlike that record, however, the music provides a stark contrast to the lyrical content.  After a couple of spins, 'Wrecking Ball' sinks in deeply because its songs are so appropriate for our society today.  There's no easy answers for the individuals who populate these songs, and Springsteen describes their emotions and desperate needs perfectly.  A good example is the touching &#34;Jack of All Trades&#34;, in which the hero is willing to take on any meaningful work he can find while the greed around him is overwhelming.  He's satisfied to be with his loved one and just make-do, but he's not naive and he's plenty angry at those who've robbed the middle class of their simple desires.  What's most interesting about the album is its musical styles.  There's gospel, folk and Irish-styled partying sounds which are in total opposition to the album's lyrics.  It's almost as if the music itself provides the defiance of the American spirit.  Bruce lets the music shout back at society to say we're down but not quite out.  &#34;Death to My Hometown&#34; and the title track throw the economic anger right back at the CEO's face, and it's thrilling to listen to.  The album's one bit of optimism is centered upon &#34;Land of Hope and Dreams&#34;, which is a beautiful anthem and one of Bruce's very best songs.  It basically confirms to us that, in our current collective condition, no one wins unless everyone wins.  It's not a happy record, not by a long shot.  But it's a thrilling and compelling one, and another perfect chronicle of America's current condition from one of its greatest musical treasures.  It's haunting, and you won't be able to turn away from it.

B00005N6KG|2.0|I used these while running because most 'normal' earphones kept falling out. This item has so many Pros and only one con that makes me give only 2 starts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lightweight<br />-Cheap (super-cheap in fact)<br />-Stays on through most vigorous exercise and you cant even feel it's there<br />-Great sound quality and good volume for price<br />-The plastic band holds its shape/strength despite putting it in various shapes (like thrown in my backpack with many other things) for days<br /><br />Cons:<br />-After a couple of months of using it I started hearing static noise from one of the sides. I wonder if it was because of my sweat, but the they are now useless. I guess these are not sweat proof (It doesn't say so and they don't appear to be). So if you are considering using this for exercise, think again. Otherwise, these are great earphones for the price.

B006QQ77F8|2.0|I commend Kubrick for first bring Nabokov's novel to the screen. However, I have to recommend director Adrian Lyne's version, with Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith, and the controversial debut of  Dominique Swain as Lolita,  over Kubrick's. This version reminds me of a Leave it to Beaver episode, no pun intended. For me, it had neither the poetic passion of Nabokov's novel or the sense of nervous guilt that Jeremy Iron's so perfectly displays in Lyne's version. Irons was perfect for the part of Humbert Humbert, you get the sense that he was obsessed by a true love for Lo. Humbert Humbert may be an anti-hero of sorts, but many people misinterpret the theme of Nabokov's novel and I can't really say that Kubrick's version did it any justice. I found it flat and dated. Nevertheless, it is worth a watch. However, I think true conesuers of Nabokov's work will find Lyne's version to be no less faithful and far more empathetic to Nabokov's vision.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games takes place in a future dystopian society, where the climate-change deniers have won, the seas rise nevertheless, inundating the coastal areas of the US and the rest of the world, causing a collapse of civil society.  The US and perhaps Canada and Mexico, have turned into \\"Panem\\" with a capital now in the Rocky Mountains.  The country was divided into specific regions, called Districts, which were ruled over with an iron hand by the decadent, moneyed elites in the Capital.  75 years in the past, the Districts revolted against the heavy dictatorial control of the Capital and the Capital forces bombed District 13 into virtual oblivion.  The populace is forced to work as slaves and starved perpetually to afford the moneyed elites in the capital an opulent, decadent lifestyle. In order to \\"celebrate\\" their omnipotent control of the districts, the Capital organizes yearly Hunger Games, where a boy and a girl, aged 12-18, are chosen from each of the remaining 12 districts, to compete in a real life Survivor game.  The last adolescent standing returns to his or her district with the assurance they and their family will never starve like the rest of the populace.  As Republicans do now, pitting one part of the middle class against the other to maintain power, the Capital pits the children of the districts against each other, and suppressing dissent with an iron fist.  It is in this fascist, sadistic, dystopian world that the protagonist, Katniss, grows up in, triumphs in the Hunger Games, and becomes the spiritual leader of a grass-roots revolution of the districts against the Capital.  Katniss is a fascinating character - a born hunter, pugnacious, clueless to her own feelings of tenderness to Peeta - the stalwart boy who loves her, defiant of anyone trying to control her.  If you are someone like me who gets easily caught up in \\"child in danger\\" stories, this has to be the ultimate - all the children are in danger, and to make the future safe for all children, it takes a heroine like Katniss to bring about lasting change.

It is a find and replace of the names Edward and Bella and some of the other Twilight characters.<br /><br />I just want to warn people about this before they go and waste money on something that was an absolute mediocre, poorly written fanfiction that is available on the internet for free.

B007CKNX28|5.0|Fans of Jack White's work will not be disappointed with the music that is presented on this album. I have already listened to the album a few times since getting it and did not once get the urge to skip a track. While I could spend a good amount of time during this review breaking down each song, I have instead decided to focus in on the mastering.<br /><br />I was extremely surprised (in a pleasant way) that this album wasn't mastered in a \\"hot\\" fashion. As many audiophiles know the \\"loudness war\\" over the past few years has reached a point where it was painful to listen to music (Pick up a copy of Metallica's Death Magnetic to hear what I mean). This album is very dynamic which makes it pleasant to listen to repeatedly. Bob Ludwig of gateway mastered this album and he has done an excellent job.<br /><br />To some it up, pick up this album for both the excellent music and mastering.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|When I first listened to Coldplay's \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" I was somewhat disappointed and did not feel that it lived up to the previous albums. It seemed there were just not as many really good songs as I had hoped for and expected, and furthermore some songs sounded a little too much like something I had previously heard.<br /><br />Now after several listenings, I tend to find the album on a par with \\"Viva la Vida\\" and \\"Prospekts March\\"<br /><br />\\"Paradise\\" stands out by being a decidedly pop-song in a way somewhat atypical of the group - in any case a really nice song.<br /><br />\\"Us Against the World\\" and \\"Up in Flames\\" is classic Coldplay ballad - at its best.<br /><br />Among the more rocking up-beat songs \\"Hurts Like Heaven,\\" \\"Charlie Brown\\" and \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" come out strongest in the picture.<br /><br />You can with some right to criticize the group for not having been good at innovating, but they are skillfully continuing creating music in the vein they started, and I believe most fans are satisfied with this.<br /><br />The sound and mastering has been criticized a lot, and I can only agree that there are times where things sound like when the pick-up of a record player has collected a large lump of dust.<br /><br />I wonder if at some point comes a remastered version of the album will be made: this it might well deserve.

I am unable to play anymore. this is beyond frustrating...I have spent hours building up my town and now what?? do not waste your time on this app. wish I had read the reviews first!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story is so great that I read the book in two days! Once you start, you can't stop! I would highly recommend it for readers who enjoy a good intrigue, with enough action and a little romance on the side. I was afraid the romance would take too much place in the plot and was relieved to see that it didn't. I'm a 19 years old girl, but would also recommend it to boys, but not kids less than 13 years old, because of the subject. Adults of any age will find something they like in the book, from Katniss' character to the complexity of the Capitol's control over the district.
B0073U2F2Q|1.0|And that's definitely saying something, especially when you consider that I am far more lenient and open-minded with certain movies than most other people.<br /><br />No, trust me and all the other one-star reviewers who've all said pretty much the same thing, this was a BORING and altogether poorly-made waste of time. If I had paid top dollar to see this in a theater, especially on Christmas Day when it opened, I would have been angrier than words could express. This film, as somebody else here has already iterated, belonged in a late-night slot on the SyFy Channel.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch, who portrays one of the few leads here, has appeared in far better films in the past. So I completely fail to see why he accepted a part in this travesty. Yes, this story DOES involve an alien invasion of sorts; that, alone, was enough to snag my interest initially because I happen to enjoy those types of films. This one, however, just never got off the ground. The character development is non-existent, it just isn't there. And the pacing? It had me nodding off after the first half hour; the plot, what little there is of it, moves slower than a snail! I never thought that was possible, but \\"The Darkest Hour\\" has certainly proven me wrong.<br /><br />I wasn't even able to finish the film and, just so you know, that has NEVER happened to me. I always see a movie through to its end, but I just plain and simply could not do that this time. This movie bored me to tears.<br /><br />I took it back to the video store to trade it in for something else and, it would appear, I wasn't the only person to do that in recent days. The clerk told me he'd had many other customers doing the same exact thing.<br /><br />If that doesn't tell you how bad \\"The Darkest Hour\\" really is, nothing will.<br /><br />Proceed to watch it at your own peril.
0439023513|5.0|I don't know what to say about this book. It is singularly the best book series I have read.  The story development, layers, character development that went into this book made for a rich in-depth story.<br /><br />This book did seem slow to me at the start, but I have to say that's because it's not as action packed as the first two.  So, i should say it was slow in comparison.  Slow or not it was a page turner from the very beginning if for no other reason than I had to find out what happened to Peeta.<br /><br />One of the most impressive aspects of this book is the character development. There was Katniss, our flawed, selfish heorine with a big heart.  It's through her eyes we see and are touched by everything around her.  Peeta, a rock who could not be broken.  Gale, Katniss'  blood thirsty, best friend with a narrow view of the world. Haymitch, the traumatized victor and one of my favorite characters.  In each book we learn more and more about Haymitch and love him more and more for it.  I loved how Collins just gave us little tidbits here and there about Haymitch that allowed us to have a better insight into who he was.<br /><br />There were some parts of the book that were expected, but there were plenty of surprises too.  I think that the book ended on a very appropriate note, bringing closure to the story arc and the characters.<br /><br />Overall in a word: BRILLIANT!<br /><br />Stats:<br />Ebook Pages: 288<br />Genere: YA<br />Re-Readability (1=Low;5=High): 5

B00005JLEX|3.0|(Season One 2 stars, Season Two 4 stars).<br /><br />While over the course of the series it is hard to give Seinfeld anything but 5 stars, it is difficult to watch the first season without a grimace. Even though it's set in the same apartment and the characters all essentially look the same (well, not Jerry's dad or Kramer), it's almost like you're watching an entirely different TV show. Based on one season we are all fortunate that the series did not get cancelled before it went on to be one of the best series of all time.<br /><br />Things don't start to really come together until the second season, although many of these episodes can also still be somewhat clumsy.  A good example is the \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\", where you had many novel things taking place in terms of plot set-up and camera work.  There were lots of funny lines that eventually became part of the Seinfeld lexicon (\\"Cartwright, four!\\"), and many consider it to be the springboard for becoming \\"the show about nothing\\". The entire episode revolves chiefly around waiting for a table at a restaurant when you're really hungry. Who would have thought that could be funny? Well yes, in season two that turned out to be the case. In season one, not so much. There was a reason we hadn't seen this approach done too much in the United States before, but the rough edges start to get worked off.<br /><br />Many fans give these early episodes somewhat of a pass because they were innovative and ultimately hey, who now doesn't like Seinfeld?  But interestingly there is nothing new under the sun, and for those looking for proof that such comedies \\"about nothing\\" have been taking place for decades they should check out the 1950s era movie [[ASIN:0780023307 Good Morning (The Criterion Collection)]].<br /><br />No, its not Seinfeld per se, and everyone who likes Seinfeld may not care for it (it's rooted in Japanese humor and subtitled for one).  But the movie is essenially nothing more than a movie-length sitcom about nothing. Most of the film features meaningless dialogue taking place in a small Japanese 1950's era suburb and pub that would not seem too far out of place from a certain New York city apartment complex and diner. The cramped asian housing quarters force you to get to know everyone whether you want to or not (they all open doors without knocking like Kramer and just walk right in). Other neighbors also include unpleasant \\"Newmans\\" that like to gossip and cause trouble, counter-culture bohemians, nosy neighbors that borrow things, and frequently unemployed hanger-on \\"Georges\\" that are mostly friendly (but selfish enough to take advantage if they need to). The closest thing to a plot here is about two self centered yet somehow still endearing kids who get upset that their parents won't by them a TV set (As George would say, \\"that's an episode\\"). We were about 15 minutes into this and my spouse said \\"What is this, Japanese Seinfeld?\\".<br /><br />Overall, the good episodes here easily outweigh the bad, and for many fans even a bad Seinfeld is better than most other shows. It is also fun to see some of show's \\"firsts\\", like Elaine pushing Jerry or watching Kramer's early hair style and knowing where it will go (or \\"go out\\" in the case of George, who had more hair at the beginning of all this then I remembered). Additional characters like Newman start to make it more of a true ensemble cast that really has only been matched in modern times by the Phil Hartman era seasons of [[ASIN:B0000ZMH8S NewsRadio - The Complete First & Second Seasons]].<br /><br />If you are like me, the last season of Seinfeld was also a disappointment (especially the final episode), and it was obvious that the series had run its full course. Still, inbetween the bookends of bad seasons 1 and the grande finale is some of the best sitcom TV of all time. Season 2 is still worthwhile, and would be closer to four stars if it were offered on its own.<br /><br />Considering the inexpensive price of this twoseason package now in 2012 it's easily worth picking up in my mind for everyone and not just the Seinfeld completist.  If you would rather dabble first, I would start out with season four.season package now in 2012 it's easily worth picking up in my mind for everyone and not just the Seinfeld completist.

B004LWZW7E|2.0|As a fan of film and literature that focuses on dystopian futures, I found the concept of the moive to be new and exciting take on what our future will become. Like in most dystopian tales we can always find a message being relayed to the audience. The comment on the huge gap between the rich and poor was not lost on me , but I found it almost being repeated and repeated through out the movie. While the concept of time as money makes for a great film, I feel the In Time missed the mark in execution. It seemed that the story would skip around and failed to fill in some details that I would have enjoyed to know. If the story was altered , I believe that In Time would be a great movie.

B0055OMBIU|5.0|bought this to work with granddaughter - I worked the first layer myself, then the second - very difficult but then that's the fun of a puzzle!  My granddaughter is helping me place the iconic buildings where they belong.  I lived in Paris for a year so it was thrilling for me to \\"re-visit\\".  Best of all, there is a time line.......the buildings, bridges, structures are put into place as they were built.  I didn't know the Notre Dame was one of the first to be built -in 1345.  My granddaughter wants me to take her to Paris.  I mounted the puzzle on something like foam core board so it is permanent.  We can revisit it again and again.  So informative!  I want to get the other cities now.  It would be wonderful if one could get the city one lives in.  Also, Amazon had the best price.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!  Works great on my Kindle Fire. Would be nice if you could zoom in on scenes, but can still play just fine. Took awhile to download, but worth the wait!!!!  GREAT GAME!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!

B007MDB71O|5.0|Saw John Carter twice in the movie theater and can't wait for the Bluray to come out.  I didn't know much about the story before seeing the film, but as I learned more about it the movie and story really took hold of me.  Despite poor marketing by Disney that didn't do justice to the movie, John Carter was an outstanding movie that offers great fun and adventure to all ages!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a great game that kept me entertained for days. Please download and atleast try it because I have no doubt you will love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Holy Mother of God!  Thought provoking, dark, edgy, funny, absolutely unable to put this book down.  Not for the weak of heart, but A must read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ive been waiting for this app for a long time omg!  so happy. ...But i think there is one more game im still looking forward to and i know everyone else is as well.  &quot;TEMPLE RUN&quot;
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Have read all 3 books in the series and liked them ok. Find that this may be well suited for youngsters. I think this hits best with romantic oriented teens - boys as well as girls. The third book was longish and not at the level of the 2 first. All this said, I an old man in his 60s devoured the first book, read the second with interest and made it through the last one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so happy.. Cuz I have a kindle and my parents.  have tilt and I wanted it so freaking bad! Yah! :D its a great game :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game I have ever play I have been on it sine 3am it is. play play play you will not want to stop
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Title. First I asked for a return after I got this horrorable product and they did not comply. Second, this microphone is very bad quality. The range is so low that when I talk my loudest it does not pick up my sound. and when it does I have to edit the sound so much it comes out fuzzy and with alot of hiss. DO NOT BUY THIS MICROPHONE! Especially from this seller.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I recommend it to anyone 14 year old and up who wish to self reflect on the 1st and 3rd world paradigm
0143120530|5.0|Who knew that there were international memory championships and that reading about them could be so interesting? In Moonwalking With Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything, author Joshua Foer writes about how he went from being an internet journalist assigned to cover this event to becoming a competitor in one, one year later. This is one of the most interesting accounts of participatory journalism ever told. But the book is much much more than this. In between the continuing tale of how the author first becomes exposed to this unique competition, how he befriends several of the competitors, is seen as a curious annoyance to others, how he is mentored and trained, how he actually trains for the competition, culminating in his competing in the American Memory Championships, Foer weaves in many pieces of interesting information. These include the techniques actually used to improve memory and to memorize vast chunks of information, a user-friendly explanation of the physiology and neurology of memory, the history of mnemonics beginning with the Greek Poet Simonedes of Ceos (who, according to legend, was able to recall the names and seating plan for all the attendees of a banquet hall suffering a roof collapse), the difference between remembering words and remembering images, profiles of those who have exploited memory techniques for personal gain and those who haven't, a wonderful discussion about the place of memorization in education, a profile of an inner city school utilizing memorization to improve the performance of its students, as well as interviews with some of the interesting personalities in the world of memory. These include an expert on experts, a memory self-help guru who becomes a multimillionaire, a victim of brain surgery gone wrong who becomes a man unable to retain memory, a supposed savant whose authenticity is severely challenged by the author and an autistic man who is the inspiration for the movie \\"Rain Man\\". We also meet some of Foer's fellow competitors, some of whom become his good friends. They are a likeable rag tag group of underachievers.<br /><br />The book does not purport to be a \\"how to\\" memory guide, and yet Foer sneakily and skillfully teaches the reader about \\"memory palaces\\" and leads us through an exercise of remembering someone else's fifteen item to-do list. I am amazed that I am still able to retain the list of 15 items long after reading this chapter, even though I still don't know what some of the items on the list are.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is both brilliant, entertaining, informative and retains the reader's interest and attention. I highly recommend this book for everyone.f Foer's fellow competitors, some of whom become his good friends.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This was my first Nesbo book, and I'll be reading the rest of them soon. Extremely well crafted, lots of twists and turns and an elaborate ending that'll have you glued to the book until it's finished.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this trilogy on vacation.  I couldn't put it down and lost a day.  I can't wait to see the movies
0345529057|4.0|First, this is a fantastic price for the first four books in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. It's well worth buying the entire set, even if you haven't read a single book. I wanted to start reading the series and started with this set rather than buying one book at a time, simply because of price. Secondly, George Martin is an incredible author. His writing is poetic, his characters are so real the reader is completely drawn in, but more than that, he crafts a compelling world so rife with deceit, gossip, tragedy, hostility, cruelty, horror, treachery, death, torture, gluttony, manipulation, lost innocence, justice and even moments of mercy, albeit often in the form of a quick death, that you can't put his books down. That said, I do have some criticisms. I gave the books four stars because I did get overloaded by the fourth book with the sheer number of characters, many of whom detract from the storyline more than carry it forward. There are also many scenes with characters that I have yet to really feel added anything to the storyline and did nothing more than pad the books and make them longer. That was particularly frustrating where the characters involved become prominent characters with many chapters dedicated to their viewpoints but who ultimately meet an abrupt end; looking back, I'm not convinced those characters were really necessary at this point. Maybe by the time the series finally ends, in probably the seventh book, I might see it differently. At what point is it better for an author to cut out some of the story, and some of the characters, and give them their own stories/books and maybe a separate series altogether? I think the Iron-born, with their drowned men gods, rituals and ideologies could have been the heart of an entirely different series. As it turned out,  we get glimpses of them but I would have loved more, and yet that would have been a detour from the focus of the plot.<br />  I have now started book five. I can't wait to catch up chronologically to where book four ended, and get on with the story and all my favorite characters.ronologically to where book four ended, and get on with the story and all my favorite characters.

B00634GHJA|5.0|I got this app for free during Amazon's free app of the day and I said, \\"Well, it's free...might as well try it.\\" and I am so happy I did. It is so convenient and does what it says. You can instantly upload and download from your wifi enabled android phone and your wifi computer. So easy, I am glad I got it.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|Closest thing depicting Hawaii as I've ever seen.  And I've lived in Hawaii for a long time.  Movie was sad, funny, emotional.  Never a dull moment.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game just like mario I would recommend this game to everyone who is a Mario fan. again love it.....download now
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enyoy the game.  In fact my 6 year old grandson has learned to play and he plays often. We find it fun for all ages.
0525478817|5.0|This is by far my favorite John Green book. Holy goodness. The character development of Hazel and Agustus is absolutely perfect. Even the addition of peripheral characters is fantastic. Hazel and Agustus (and even Isaac) walk that fine line of being precocious and being silly teenagers who write smart aleck ads for dilapidated swing sets on a Craigslist sort of forum. John Green has that magical ability to perfectly balance humor and tenderness. This book is so perfectly hilarious and at the same time, poignant. I've never laughed or cried so much in one book. Well done, John. DFTBA -Sarah
0385737947|5.0|Great book had me hooked the first chapter. Lots of action. All the characters have their own personalty. Perfectly paced.
0385343175|1.0|This was one of the worse Danielle Steel books I've ever read. Maybe it's because I stopped reading her years ago as I feel she is more for a younger reader.<br /><br />In a nutshell the book was repetitive.  How many times can Huges say he loves his daughter. He loves his hotel. Heloise loves the<br />Hotel .....we get it.  I had a hard time getting through this, I just wanted to put it down but was determined to finish it.<br /><br />I will say the book got much better by the last few chapters but by then I had already formed my opinion of the book.<br /><br />If the book would have been as interesting from beginning to end it would have been acceptable.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Nicely produced melodrama and its an interesting look at race relations from a different point of view that most Americans don't think about.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Wow! Finally available and before anyone else. Keep up the great work and terrific price! I can't wait for season 5 to begin.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this updated version is better but still has some minks to work out. sometimes I have to wait a long time to get in a room and sometimes get booted out for no reason rather suddenly. the next criticism is for the players...GROW UP. don't write out the word or guess the word poop for every answer.
B007LEC7CC|5.0|Before MDNA was released, the first track I heard off this album in it's entirety was \\"I f***ed up\\".  I put it on repeat and listened to it for over an hour.  Right then I decided to give some serious thought to buying the album when it became available.  When it did, I listened to all 17 thirty second clips and heard nothing that said don't buy, so I did.<br />WOW!  Madonna (IMHO) had her work cut out for making a comeback and she not only did this in spades, she bumped the bar up and showed a lot of current artists just who she is and where she came from.<br />I'm 54 and have watched and listened to her ever since she came on to the scene.  IMHO, she NEEDED something like this and delivered a LOT more than I expected.<br />The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Yes, some of the songs are dark (Gang Bang in particular)and explicit, a little different for her, but she showed everyone just who Madonna is, what she is capable of and to never rule her out. Thanks for a superb album Madonna!

1423113462|5.0|When I actually received this book as a gift for the first time, I treated it indifferently: it was just another book. However, when I looked at the cover more carefully, I realized this book was a part of the famous Percy Jackson series, which EVERYBODY has been so excited about. As usual, since those types of book turn out to be good from my experience, so I tried it, and liked it immediately. I mean, I literally fell in love with it from chapter 1. I knew the Olympus hero chronicles had a very good reputation, but I had NO IDEA. Until now, that is....<br /><br />This book starts off with a big rush of information which overwhelms people to keep reading, or at least gives off intensity. You open the first page of the book, and there is a boy who is obviously the main character suffering a memory loss. He has no idea who he is, or what he is doing in there, and what the relation between him and a cute girl sitting next to him, holding arms. And here it comes: after a few whatnots, the sky opens up into a storm in matter of seconds, and storm spirits rushes out, causing chaos.<br /><br />If you are a newbie to this series of books like I was, you probably have NO IDEA what is going on, so you keep reading o find out. However, I assume, if you read all previous book regarding the subject, you will still get intrigued by the new setting. I assume... If not, well, I better hurry up and read the rest of the chronicle to find out.<br /><br />This book got my attention not only because of the reasons I listed, but also because it is mystery adventure fiction with real-life logics and some magic actions: I love those kinds of books. (aka: harry potter) this deserves a five star in my opinion, and I hope you find it nice as well. Till next, bye~
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I felt that the first book was the best of three, the second one was not too bad. The third book I had some mixed feelings about. I understand that circumstances change and characters must evolve but it wasn't as intriguing of a read as the other books in the trilogy.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I realy was good but it only let me in the game please fix it. also make sure you make sure. this dose not happen to you.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I heard everyone talking about this game a school. I wanted to play it but i didnt have an apple device. Now i can get it on my kindle fire! Now they need to add temple run and everything would be perfect.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|I was confused by the Danish names since this was the first of the series that I have read.  I found the story line hard to follow, and I suppose that's because I haven't read the first or second one.  I don't think I'm interested in doing so - there's too much other good stuff out there for me to waste my time on this.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is one of the few apps I have installed on every device I own.  It stores and syncs notes, web pages, scans and many other things you want to be able to retrieve wherever you are.

B007IQX1G4|1.0|This movie was slow, dumb, and awkward. We've all been whiteness to the egotistical, crazy, and still stuck in high school ex popular person. I didn't feel like this movie portrayed that. This movie is called \\"Young adult,\\" and really should be named, \\"Crazy, dumped, and needs to go straight to rehab.\\" Just sayin' not worth the watch.

B000002MUW|5.0|In 1994, Bedtime Stories was released. It had Madonna taking a bit of a mainstream R&B route, but it works extremely well. Some standouts include Survival, Secret, Don't Stop, Inside of Me, and Human Nature. Even though this album was mainstream for the most part, she was able to create artsy songs like Sanctuary and Bedtime Story, which makes great contrast. Of course, this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning Take a Bow, which was a massive hit for a reason in its day, but it has aged extremely well, as has the rest of this album. Top 40 and avant-garde at the same time, this album wasn't as popular as other Madonna albums, despite the success of Take a Bow. However, it's still a great album worth checking out.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|horrid game I mean it requires no brain power and is very slow! :( don't waste your money! bad choice for a game.
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick made many wonderful albums over the years, but \\"Rockford\\", an album the band released in 2006, ranks as one of their very best ever. What a pleasure to see such quality at this point in their career. This album contains the classic Cheap Trick formula; melodic rockers and power pop ballads, songs that stick in your brain and leave you smiling. Guitarist Rick Neilsen is still a loveable maniac, and lead vocalist Robin Zander sounds as strong and assured as he did 30 years ago. Listen to him belt out the lyrics to \\"If It Takes a Lifetime\\" and \\"Every Night and Every Day\\" and you will be a believer all over again. The rhythm section of the band also remains the same: drummer Bun E. Carlos and bassist Thom Petersson still supplying the dependable backbone of the band's distinctive sound. The more I play this album, the more I'm convinced it's a classic. Not a weak song to be found.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game.  Highly recommend.  I Have to say its so different than any other mahjong that I have played in the past. This does add to its appeal.
B00008NRLX|5.0|The Jayhawks have made plenty of wonderful albums over the years, but \\"Rainy Day Music\\" is my favorite of the lot. Although earlier albums such as \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\" and \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" are considered by most critics --- and more than a few fans --- as the best ones the Jayhawks ever made, my personal favorites are the ones that the band made after Mark Olson left the band, such at this one, \\"Smile\\", and \\"Sound of Lies\\". The diehard Jayhawks fans will no doubt ridicule such a musically sacrilegious statement, but while I like the early albums very much, and I like Mark Olson, I find that there's just something more magical about the albums with Gary Louris handling lead vocals. And there is lots of magic on this album. Songs that float and soar and caress your heart and soul. Call it Americana, or folk-rock, or country-soul, or whatever you like, this is just excellent music.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game because you can unlock more and more games. the games are realy fun. all of my friends have this game.
B003OJBWGK|4.0|I really enjoyed Best Coat's debut album Crazy for You. The album offers half an hour's worth of songs with simple, light lyrics and fun, catchy tunes that evoke feelings of relaxing summertime, nostalgia for youth, first crush/love.<br /><br />Some reviews have pointed out that the songs can be repetitive and feel as if they blend together. I enjoyed this album, but yes there's a degree of repetition. However listening to it the whole way through was very relaxing because of the way the songs flowed together and the lead singer's vocals. Alternatively, the album can be enjoyed by scattering a few songs into a playlist and put it on shuffle, because individually the songs are a blast.<br /><br />All in all, it's light listening good for relaxing or (non-club) dancing. Maybe Best Coast is more of a singles band than an album band, but I nevertheless enjoyed the entire album, and I do hope that they mature and develop their sound, because they're definitely talented.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very addicting and fairly challenging<br />Although I wish glu coins were a bit more common as it seems much of the game would be impossible without them.
1469984202|5.0|really enjoyed the series.  I read most of the annual \\"year's best/hugo/nebula\\" award books and this series stands right along the best of those stories (and better than most these days).  just finished the prequel and am looking forward to more of the story -- don't leave us hanging...!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Reminds me of PvZ. In a good way. :) It makes game play intuitive and easy to learn. good job!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|best book ever!  and it reminds me to read just for five minutes  it doesnt force me it  encourages me to read and i love it
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Overall this is a great app.  I've used it on BlackBerry, iOS, and Aneroid.  I would give 5 stars but requiring the User to register for an account with YouVersion to create and save notes, along with the fact that you cannot create notes without a internet connection bums me out.  I take my kindle to church where wifi is not available and almost no signal in the sanctuary.  I was hoping to move away from writing notes on paper.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I was looking for a game for myself. The kids have enough space on my fire. I enjoyed this game! Lot's of things to do hints if you just don't know what to do next. Lot's of game fun, great price!
B007BRJYF2|5.0|I purchased this app last night and tried to install today but it would only go 2% download every time I tried, so I called Amazon and a very nice young man told me to hold the power button for about 10-15 seconds to reboot the KF.  Finally, success, it downloaded and I was playing in minutes.  So, if your having trouble downloading it try the power reboot and see if that works, it did for me...and now I'm a happy camper!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|esta muy divertido y no abburido. el torro esta muy miedo porque se dented esta muy largo. esta muy bueno
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is one of the most beautiful films I've had the pleasure of viewing in a long time and one of the best to come out of modern Cinema.  Its story and beautiful world are truly inspiring and fully captured my imagination.  I would recommend this film to anyone even those who are not overly fond of sci-fi movies, it is that engaging.  If you do not see this wonderful film then you are truly missing out on an amazing journey with a beautiful message.  Oh and it's even more breathtaking in 3D!
1426308469|5.0|Illustrations and wording is perfect for children. Fun but still educational. The comparison to human size is a great fun feature. My 4 year old nephew loves this book!
B001684L0A|5.0|The John Adams dvds are absolutely fabulous.  They should really be required viewing in our schools, perhaps high school social studies classes, as they bring American history to life in such an interesting way.  The actors portraying all the historical luminaries, not only John Adams and his wife, but George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, etc., were spot-on.  We also loved the theme music for this show!
B004VRL4BM|1.0|I bought series 4 and 5 from here and series 4 was a repeat of series 3 and series 5 turned out to be repeats of ones we've already seen.What's going on?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good app with a lots of good and recent versions. Hope to be able to have parallel versions. Thanks for making this free.
0553801473|4.0|For a long time I was tentative about buying this book thanks to all the bad reviews but thankfully I decided on giving it a try and I'm glad I did. Just because the author takes new directions doesn't mean its a bad book. The prose is still great, the plot is amazing and the characters are for the most part very interesting. Then there is the \\"nothing happens\\" complain. I strongly disagree with that. There are no big battles or sword fights, true. If that's what you mean \\"nothing happens\\" then you are right but in reality a whole lot happens. They are not the flashy turn of events from the past, they are more of a subtle kind of way but turns of events that change the landscape dramatically. As I said before the prose is great. The mastery of words the author show us through-out Tyron's travels is beautiful. Any literature aficionado would appreciate it. The new characters, well some are great others not so much just like the originals characters. Then there are the comparisons,\\"The first 3 books were better\\". Yeah that's true, but it's like saying Paul McCartney music sucks because is not as good as his previous work with The Beatles. which is not the case, he is still a great song-writer even if his best days are behind. That's why I give it 4 stars and not 5. With the critics I agree that Martin should do a better work of trimming out the fat. In all a very solid offering. 4 stars out of 5. 7 out of 10 (I prefer a scale of 1 to 10)

B004EPYZUS|2.0|I have to wonder if there are statistics that track people getting hurt--or killed--when they try the kind of Impossible Movie Physics (IMP) that this movie lays down every 90 seconds.  Like having an explosion go off directly under you and waking up just a little groggy.  Or running along the outside of a building on a length of computer cable and then letting go to fly through a window 60 feet away and two stories below, and coming out of it just a little sore and out of breath.  Or driving a car off a cliff and surviving the 10-story impact because of the airbag.  Or jumping out of a moving car at 70mph and getting up just slightly out of breath with scuffed-up clothing.  This movie is guilty of some of the most ridiculous IMP I have ever seen, right down to the pathetically ubiquitous outrunning of bullets and explosions, and it just keeps coming, over and head-shakingly over.<br /><br />This film is just absolutely, perfectly and consistently ridiculous from start to finish, with eye-poppingly preposterous action and story, from the ridiculous opening to the farcical finish.  If you love mindless Hollywood action, this luxurious, globe-trotting mash of style and tech and beauty and hot hot action will just knock yer socks off.<br /><br />Director Brad Bird gave us a genuine masterpiece with [[ASIN:B0049J3Q7W The Incredibles]], and if you're paying attention you can see some of the touches in this film that made that one work so well, especially in the soundtrack.  But given this story, I almost feel sorry for him . . . and for the millions he and the producers (Tom Cruise, whaddaya know) made from this thing.<br /><br />The story is contrived to fit around action set pieces, with the IMP necessarily inconsistent from scene to scene.  Apparently there are no police or local security forces anywhere these guys go, they're just nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />A public figure openly expounds the need for global thermonuclear warfare for years, and clearly sets out to make it a reality, and none of the governments of the world take action?  Really?<br /><br />The IMF mission brief in a public payphone, right out in the open?  Really?  Little Tom Cruise, MMA n' all, takes on 40-odd cons in a Russian prison, and is just fine?  Really?  Cruise the known spy kept in just a normal Russian peneteniary, really? Our heroic team of four spy-biz pros have to go through all kinds of gyrations--with a prep time of 4 ½ hours--to penetrate the Kremlin's most secure spaces, but the bad guy walks in out all by himself, in a smart tweed suit?  Really?  And the Kremlin blows up quite spectacularly; how many hours labor of how many people did that take to set up?  And the Russians didn't detect any of this?  Really?<br /><br />And now that the bad guy has nuclear launch codes for Russian missiles, the Russians don't just supersede the entire release and authentication scheme (like they--and we--have been doing routinely for more than 60 years), rendering his theft completely useless?  Really?  There's only one set of launch codes for Russia's nuclear weapons.  Really?<br /><br />A Russian train car packed with electronics and communications gear and weapons?  With an external digital keypad and retina scanner?  That is never discovered as it travels the railways of Russia?  Really?<br /><br />Penetrating a ridiculously situated server room with some kind of movie-sci-fi magnetic levitation gadget to beat the room's airplane-turbine cooling system.  Really?  Aren't these servers tended by, say, humans, who might use a door?  And using a super-powerful magnet to awesomely levitate the agent, in close proximity to the computers you're going to seize to control the satellite.  Really?  Massive magnets and computers . . . who wrote this stuff?<br /><br />And lots of ham-handed product placement. But high-end products, so it's okay.  I know now that the most popular vehicles in Russia, Dubai and India are [[ASIN:B005C1V64G BMWs]].  Yeah, like IMF agents who have been disavowed by The Secretary are going to roll up to the target's home in a [[ASIN:B007QN9EV0 BMW concept car]].  Subtle.<br /><br />In the end the only thing saving this film from a single star was the location shooting.  Going to Russia, Dubai and India is classy filmmaking.<br /><br />Bottom line: It all succeeds because the core audience demographic is too thick to see the massive plot holes and made-up science.  It's blinky lights and pretty colors, and it's oh so mesmerizing, such a great way to drop $15, get some popcorn and a Butterfinger, and waste a coupla hours.ts who have been disavowed by The Secretary are going to roll up to the target's home in a [[ASIN:B007QN9EV0 BMW concept car]].

0756914582|5.0|Terry Prachett, I heart you and your takes on famous tales. This one in the Discworld series is a real stand-aloner. Prachett takes on the \\"Tale of the Pied Piper\\" with the aplomb you'd expect, but he tackles this with a grace I found surprisingly appetizing. You don't need to read a single other Discworld novel to enjoy this one, though it does appear to take place in the same mulit-verse as his other works.<br /><br />This is a very grown-up story, though it was awarded the Carnegie Award for Children's Literature in 2001. This award is a British medal not at all equivalent to our Caldecott; its other winners include Neil Gamon, so you know they love a ^$&@)-up story with gruesome grown-up bits to it. The Amazing Maurice....has just that: %$@&)-up bits that are VERY grown up. In this version of the famous tale, the rats have eaten from the Wizards' trash heap. Because they've ingested magical substances, they've become intelligent (a la Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIHM and Flowers for Algernon). And as they became intelligent on a trash heap, they learned to read there. So they took amusing names from food labels like \\"Hamnpork\\" and \\"Peaches\\" and \\"Dangerous Beans\\". Then enters the Maurice of the title, a common stupid alley cat who eats one of the rats (BEFORE the cat became intelligent), thereby ingesting the magical substances second hand and then becoming enchanted, too. (He always asks his food if it can talk before he eats it thereafter).<br /><br />What results is an amalgam of Puss In Boots and other tales, but only as Prachett could imagine them. Maurice is still very much a cat, so he's cruel and shiftless and selfish by nature. The rats are developing a sense of morality he doesn't seem capable of grasping. And the most cruel of all creatures, man, is revealed to be the least intelligent of all. This just makes me love Prachett even more, if that's possible.

0307279189|5.0|This is such a good book! It helps remind you why we run! The book is well written and is truly inspirational.  It is definitely a must read.
B006L9B6TI|3.0|It was a good reminder on paying attention to ALL the little daily things that are a bit of magic in our lives every day, all day long.  And learning to notice along with appreciating is a gift!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Great combination of relaxation and stressful challenges. It is like an exercise in how to problem solve on a relaxed state.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A very interesting book that I have throughly enjoyed reading.  I love the story about an oppressing government and what the people do to fight back.
B005721W9O|5.0|You'll probably have fun watching Galaxy Quest whether or not you're a fan of science fiction films, because it's quite funny. You'll probably especially like it if you like Star Trek.
0553801473|2.0|Perhaps Im not a true and loyal fan of the series. I started reading them in August of 2011...its now the end end of April 2012 and today I finished Dance w/Dragons. I never really had to wait for anything to be written. When DWD got too long winded for me I just started skimming..whooshing through to the next good bit. Not a problem for me. If it turned out that the once skimmed part was necessary to my understanding of the story I fanned back the pages and got what was needed. It's a great story and Ill wait for the next book calmly knowing that if it never comes Ill imagine the ending for myself...after all it may not be Georges story anymore anyway. I do wonder tho how they'll cope with this all at HBO.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|The Truman Show is, for one thing, a good comedy. There is also a detective-story element, as Truman starts piecing the clues together to come up with an incredible (but as it happens true) theory. And there are the serious implications of privacy and social control. Excellent acting too.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This trilogy is perhaps the only one (the Romance genera notwithstanding) where, about 50 pages in, I started skipping the tedious, gratuitous sex. If you removed the \\"erotica,\\" the plot could be comfortably published as a brochure.
086571701X|5.0|Aquaponic Gardening by Sylvia Bernstein is extremely clear and informative.  Reading this book, I have been able to learn and understand how various systems work and how to build my own aquaponic system.  Most important, I have learned what \\"not\\" to do, so that I do not make any costly mistakes.  I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to start an aquaponic garden.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its so much fun and entertaining.I have so much fun on it that I forget what time it is.
014312093X|5.0|I first read this book as a college student. Way too soon to appreciate the reflections of the characters on their lives and their futures, which is the strongest part of the book when read at retirement age. Some books need a lifetime of personal experience to appreciate the power of betrayed trust, faded love, and a host of other events that from time to time dominate our lives. The revelations about the spy trade are revealing and suspenseful, and deserve praise for their own merit, but the way in which the trade affects the interior lives of the characters is the highlight.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I couldn't stop playing it I was really hooked on it but just make the game a lot longer please or joust make a full version
B0073XORLU|4.0|At first i wondered what the story line was.Read the insert,and it all came to life-listen and read about the grown ups life.Well recorded --FUN-WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I can actually fill out forms instead of just viewing pdf's. just what I needed. better than expected after reading other peoples negative comments on it.
B005LAIHEA|5.0|\\"The Five-Year Engagement\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Beginning where most romantic comedies end, this film looks at what happens when an engaged couple keeps getting tripped up on the long walk down the aisle.<br /><br />The cast led by Jason Segel (as Tom, who also co-wrote the story & screenplay & executive produced) & Emily Blunt (as Violet) is great. The directing by Nicholas Stoller (who also co-wrote the story & screenplay & produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Segel & Stoller is great.<br /><br />The music by Michael Andrews is great. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is great. The film editing by William Kerr & Peck Prior is great. The production design by Julie Berghoff is great. The art direction by John B. Josselyn is great. The set decoration by Sophie Neudorfer is great. The costume design by Leesa Evans is great.<br /><br />This is a great and funny romantic comedy-drama that feels different from some romantic comedy-dramas of recent memory. This is also another interesting Judd Apatow production that does a terrific job of mixing romance, comedy and drama blend solidly well. Jason Segel & Emily Blunt have terrific chemistry together. This is also a well-made and well-done movie, as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will admit, when I first read Mockingjay, I hated it. However, after I tried reading it again, I began to understand the book. Suzanne Collins proved her worth as a writer again. the more you think about this book, the more it hits you. I really loved this book after reading it a second time. Now, I'm really excited to see how they spin Mockingjay into a movie (or two).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|While I am not finished with the entire series, what I have read is excellent.  It is impossible to put the books down and I love them.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is a great app. It is easy to use and is a great way to show off your phone or tablet running Android.. Great job on updates it has only gotten better.
B007R12TNQ|5.0|my daughters thought this movie was really funny. They kept asking to watch it again. on the same day... i didnt get a chance to see the whole thing but i stopped a few times while cleaning and i thought it was pretty funny.
B004IWF64Q|1.0|So, I mean I understand that Disney wanted to continue the story of Pocahontas, but honestly, this movie was not worth watching at all. All of the returning characters seemed super OC and I didn't like that. And also, Mrs. Jenkins was a weird character and I found her pushing Rolfe and Pocahontas disgusting and unnecessary. Now for my rant about Rolfe. He had absolutely no character development, but simply went from a jerk to a nice man in a blink of the eye. That doesn't happen in real life. Yes I know, relating a Disney movie to real life is stupid, but honestly they should have had enough sense to at least show him change a little. Now, when John Smith came back I had a little hope, because I was figured \\"Well, he and Pocahontas can just pick up where they left off\\" Because their parting in the first movie was so emotional. But then to A) have him act obnoxious and then B) have Pocahontas just not love him anymore, completely ruined the whole story line of the first movie. Hadn't they said something about always being there for each other in the first movie? Well obviously it didn't carry into the second. And to have him let her go with John Rolfe so easily? Really? What man in love do you know that would let them woman he loves go off with another guy just like that? Seriously.<br /><br />All in all it is a HUGE disappointment and if you do watch it, don't expect anything great.
0345803485|1.0|I was excited about reading this book but was disappointed very soon after starting it.  The writing is shallow and uninteresting with no character development or viable plot.  I complete waste of time.  Don't bother!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has not released her trilogy on iBooks so I bought on Amazon and read it via the Kindle app on my iPad. This book is amazing - I cannot put it down. And for those of you who are reluctant to read it for fear that it is just another love story like Twilight, you could not be more wrong - it's so much more than that. READ IT!
0345803485|1.0|\\"A class by itself.\\" Really EW? Class by itself meaning the lowest class possible?<br />This was the worst book I've ever read. If it wasn't the fact that its fanfiction, it was the horrid grammar and punctuation, or maybe the fact that it's supposedly BDSM erotica but in fact it's partner abuse and sadism with a dash of pedophile-mommy issues?<br />Yeah, this was the worst book I've ever read. And I've read a lot of books. Stick with the fanfiction if you must read.
0345803485|5.0|I read this book simply because i heard it was good. After reading all three books i finally read some reviews. I was surprised on how people really didn't like it. However, i could agree with them on some points.<br /><br />  I absolutely loved these books. Christian was the reason i kept reading them. I loved the \\"inner goddess\\" references from Ana. BUT I really wish i didn't have to read so much of the sex because it did get boring! I had to skim past most of the scenes. However, I will say the love he has for her makes me melt! Yes, he is jealous, controlling blah blah. But he loves her very much! And i'm rooting for them the whole time.<br /><br /> Fun, easy read!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|no snipers., no zombies just plane Mario bros reborn.!!!!!  it is fun and easy to play no special nintendo skips necessary
0439023513|1.0|After the first two books of the trilogy I could not wait to read Mockingjay. But, it was a big let down. The amount of dramatic dialog over the actual story was just too much. I found myself skipping pages as I tired of Kitness's constant internal struggle over anything and everything. The war itself went uncovered through most of the book so we just kept getting dropped into the action without really understanding how the rebels were being successful. I understand that the characters changed throughout the story, but they went through some pretty unusual directions.<br />The final chapters that led to the ending were unbelievable and instead of a build up to the final confrontation with the President it whimpered out.<br />Also can't that girl walk out the door without being severally wounded and having to spend time in the hospital.<br />As a whole the trilogy is a good read and will keep you entertained, but be prepared to walk away looking forward to the movie version so we can have the action of the first two books with an exciting finish.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the third book (and last?) written by Larsson. I read the two previous ones and enjoyed very much all of them.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Wow this game is a must have. It's so much fun and addicting. If you like Super Mario Bros. You will love this game.
B000051Y0G|5.0|This is a good CD. Her best songs are the first 6 tracks. Girls Just Want to Have Fun, She Bop, and All Through the Night are fantastic. Some of her songs are a little weird but she still is a good singer. I love how her early work was new wave. A good CD to buy if you are a fan of Cyndi Lauper and the 80s. Enjoy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game,  expect to spend a lot of time with this game. I find it to be very addictive. Enjoy it.
B00007J36V|4.0|This is my first Fairport convention CD and I'm hooked.<br />Love the wide range of places they take their music.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I realize that I am of the older generation, but as a teacher of Junior High School students for 25 years, I am appalled that so many in our society are comfortable with and rate so highly, books and a movie of 12 to 18 year old children hunting down and killing each other when the obvious reason is for the entertainment of society. (All televised.)  Have we regressed to Roman times when gladiators fought to the death or when people were fed to the lions in the arenas for entertainment of the masses?<br /><br />Why are we so offended by the killing of bulls in bullfighting, killing of dogs or chickens in dog and chicken fighting, but not in the killing of children?  Are we desensitizing our children and our society even more than what our vicious, violent movies are doing?  Just remember, when we devalue life so, it will be easier for the young to not only kill each other, but also the elderley, the infirm, etc.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app gives me something to do when I'm bored! Recommend for people who like games and have free time.
0345528581|5.0|I used to have time to go to the gym and lift, and run 10+ miles, and do open water swims... then I had kids! After many months of zero working out (post kids), I found this book.  Today I finished the 10 week program and it was fantastic.  I'm not sure I could post stunning \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" pics, but I would absolutely recommend this book for the following reasons:<br />- gym membership now costs me $0 per month (although I did splurge and buy two soccer balls at target to make the push ups harder).<br />- my commute time from bed to working out (upstairs) takes under 2 minutes.<br />- I can work out in silence before my kids wake up.  These workouts are very short (20-30 min or so), but effective. You can't get more bang for your time invested than this folks.<br />- Commute from working out to breakfast/shower at home - 30 seconds.<br />- Also love that these exercises heavily hit your core since you need core strength to do many of the upper and lower body exercises anyway.  Great total body workout.<br />- I don't travel much, but these could easily be done pretty much anywhere (hotel room, park, etc.)<br /><br />Overall highly recommended for busy athletic folks who want the best bang for their time (and money) invested!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The whole family uses this to kill time. Got rid of a lot of game apps because this has everything.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|First of all I am not a Teenager, and I enjoyed the book so much that I had to read the other two just so I could find out what happened everyone. I have not seen the movie yet but plan to soon. I do think that book 2 would also make an excellent movie. I like the fact that she's a survivor not a superwoman but just a survivor.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is the first time I have read fiction of this genre.  While it held my interest (I wasn't aware of the media blitz until I was halfway finished reading the first of the trilogy), I was also aware of the awkward phrasing (the \\"gee whiz\\" comments of Ana), the repetitious language, etc.  We all know it's not going to win any literary awards, but it would be far more credible if someone would have taken the time and effort to at least proofread, and maybe use a thesaurus.  Seriously, I am 61 years old and I don't want to read comic books.  I live close to Seattle so that also held my interest, but if our heroine is not a complete blithering idiot it would behoove her to become a little more sophisticated.  If she can bare her chest in France, she can walk down the sidewalk in heels in Seattle, Washington.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it is very slow and it does not load quickly. I am not a huge fan of it. it should be faster
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|N O W all we need is T E M P L E RUN amd we'll be good please hurry with temple run
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game you don't need wi-fi or anything just get and you got a angry birds! So get it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game except 4add after each game. loved game. you will enjoy it<br />worth downloading.  you can get by the advertisements the game is awesome
B006ON41FC|5.0|Lol! This game is so much fun and so addicting! My advice to you is get! Way worth the money!
B007CKNX28|5.0|Thought I'd give Jack White a try after viewing the film \\"It Might Get Loud!\\"  Glad I did....now this is good music!  I know I've heard of The White Stripes but never really heard anything they have done!  I will now seek out their CDs although I hear that this new CD is a little different and The White Stripes are more guitar driven songs!  Just what the doctor ordered I say!  Thanks Jack White...you beat the hell out of that Jack Black character!
B005HSL626|1.0|I think the ad free version of this game would be great but I keep getting interrupted by stupid ads. You have to click no to 3 different things every time it starts. Sorry it got deleted from my kindle.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I played the original years and years ago.<br />this beats the old version. better graphics/ challenges and teaches money management.
B003L77FYS|5.0|To be Honest the show is awesome, the plot & the background music selection is uniqe from other shows which I have seen Before.
067144901X|5.0|I'm so glad this book is still for sale. I had no idea what it was called, and found it by typing in every single line of the book into google - yep, I still know them by heart, and for the record I just turned 22. My mom turned the words into a song, and my sister and I drove her crazy asking for her to reread it.<br /><br />So yeah - this one is definitely a keeper. I'm happy to know people still read it, and hope it's still around if and when I have kids someday.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my g-ma has this on her I phone I love this game and finally they put it on the kindle fire love this app so so so so much
B007SGM084|5.0|Great set of books. Especially, for women. Could not put down book 1. Every woman wants or has a 50 in some way.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great freemium game. it gets quite challenging but it possible to go through without purchasing anything. Gift boxes seem work only when you win the level.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I don't like when you have to visit friends to complete missions. It doesn't let me see friends. It keeps saying I have to restart it to install an update inorder to do it but nothing happens when I do restart it.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Purchasing Own the Night with the Digital Booklet was the best download ever, because of the price and I love listening to the band, Lady Antebellum!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love it!;]  Know can we get a temple run? Another question why cant we have the same apps at the same time that android's do?
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I first started playing and thought it was kind of fun, thought it was a fun app. I was wrong. a quick way to advance is to buy acorns or coins, but have to actually pay real money for them. Around level ten it wants you to go to a friends village,in order to do that you have to either log on to facebook, or have a password for gameloft live. This is not ideal since this is supposed to be a kids game. To go along with that,you can not advance in the game unless you do that.THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME.
B004K4AVAG|2.0|I figured I'd wait until nearly a year had passed tosit down and give this album a full, proper listen. I thought if the dust had settled, I'd be able to give it a serious listen, and yes, I have made it this far without listening to front to back. Usually the comparison I make when I listen to albums, I compare them to a conversation. And this conversation? Well, it rambled and wandered off... but I listened, alright.<br /><br />Look, I will admit I am a tad biased toward Gaga, I'll admit I hated her at first but i quickly got into The Fame album, and the Fame Monsters EP. however, I wasn't pleased when I heard the lead singles off this album- the first was a Madonna ripoff and Judas sounds like something too crappy to make it onto Dance Dance Revolution.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this album is it's too long, and it rambles too much. There's 14 tracks and there don't need to be 14 tracks- at least 25% of the songs feel like b-sides. Not even good enough for that- I'd call them Z-sides. All the songs sound exactly the same!!! All of them have the same thump thump thump beat and while it may sound fun the first few tracks, for the rest of them it just sounds boring.<br /><br />There's only a handful of tracks I really like on this disc. \\"Bloody Mary\\", mainly because it reminds me of early Garbage material, and Lady Gaga sounds a lot like Shirley Manson on it. Her voice is so beautiful on it, its insane. \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" is fun and quirky, delightfully naughty and just an enjoyable track all around. I also really like \\"Scheisse\\", it's funny and surprisingly has a good message too.<br /><br />That's about it. \\"Marry the Night\\" is boring and whiny crap. We already know how much I hate the eponymous track and Judas. Government Hooker is BLAND. Hair is cheesy and awful. Actually, we already know what I'm about to say...<br /><br />If you want a good disc by a female artist, I suggest you invest in \\"Blonde\\" by Coeur de Pirate, \\"Born to Die\\" by Lana Del Rey or even the new Madonna disc. But by all means, avoid this disc. It's boring and bland, and enough to put anyone off Gaga.even the new Madonna disc. But by all means, avoid this disc. It's boring and bland, and enough to put anyone off Gaga.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Most soldiers don't easily discuss their wartime experiences.  I appreciate Chris Kyle's forthright discussion of his life as a warrior from training through his combat service and his life after he left the SEAL Teams.  This is not just a book of \\"war stories,\\" it describes a way of life that many people don't know anything about and therefore cannot develop an appreciation for the sacrifices our soldiers make and the physical and emotional hardship they endure.  His story is further enriched by contributions from his wife, Taya, relating her own perspective of his service and how it affected his family here at home.<br /><br />The book also provides an opening (like the one Chris smashed in a wall to create a firing position) for us to see the enemies that he faced from a soldier's perspective.  It's different picture than what is drawn for us by the various media outlets here at home.<br /><br />Thank you, Chris and Taya, for your sacrifice and service to our country and for sharing your lives with us.
0385342063|5.0|Really thought this was great.  I have read other chick-lit novels looking for some meat.  Thought this was as well written and funny as the Shopaholic series,but a little more down to earth.  I would recommend it to all my lady friends who are chasing children or working 5-9, better than Calgon.
B00005214X|5.0|If you're not familiar with George's work following the break-up of the Beatles, you are in for a treat. This album is arguably his finest. I've just recently purchased this boxed edition...not for the additional tracks not found on the original release, but, as a replacement for my hi-jacked-by-ex third copy that replaced my hi-jacked-by-girlfriend second copy that replaced my worn-out original release copy. This music is some of my all-time favorites and still sounds as fresh today as it did back then in 1970.<br />Just buy it. You will not regret it.
B00005JMK0|5.0|Please video makers out there! Please, please release this movie on DVD compatible for the US. I absoultely LOVE LOVE this. I used to have it on a \\"beta\\" tape.. Thats how much I love it and for how long I have loved it. Such an adorablely cute movie. It always brought a smile to my face.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|For Sci-Fi fans and those who in general want to see a good, clean, and family movie, John Carter is not to be missed. Most notably, based on the books that started the genre of Sci-fi, John Carter tells an original tale like no other and creates such a unique world, not seen in any other film. Having seen this movie twice in 3D at the theaters, the Blu-ray 3D was a no brainer with beautiful depth throughout the film and just a bit of push when needed.<br /><br />With nearly a $300 million gross worldwide, John Carter is the Sci-Fi fantasy you've been waiting for!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|My wife, who is no prude, just finished reading this book and thought it was cheap and written in a manner to encourage you to read the \\"next edition\\"...The excessive, gratuitous  sex, to her was very contrived and just for purient disengenous and titillating purposes....(may appeal to mainly horney unsatisfied housewives)....there's been much better sexy novels i.e. Jaqueline Susanne wrote better stuff....this was a pure fluff book.  My wife felt foolish for  reading, (actually for finishing it). Oh well, there's got to be lots of better stuff out there.
B0068PHS5Q|1.0|I couldn't be bothered finishing this .....it just seemed to go on and on ..getting more and more unbelievable with each chapter. Occasionly the writing was good but then , particularly with conversation, it was awful.Definitely not recomended.
1591795230|4.0|The subject matter is very challenging. Accepting the authors ideas requires you to change your own beliefs.  Written in didactic style, at times was difficult to understand the science of epigenetics.  Plan to reread if you are interested in the topic but not well versed in cellular biology and physiology.

0439023491|5.0|This book is such a great story. It tops the first with flying colors, There was no way I was putting this one down. I feel right in and didn't want to come out. So many twist and turns. I just love the charters. Katniss seems to get over being as scared and does some really exciding things in Catching fire! So do the rest of them. So don't miss out on Book # 2 of the Hunger Games.<br />I my self is ready to pick # 3 up.<br /><br />I know it's short but i think wow says it all!
B006UG90RM|4.0|There were reasons to be fearful: Van Hagar had gone MOR, Eddie looked frightfully wrecked only a couple of years ago, DLR's career had been in the tubes since it started, and replacing Michael Anthony with your 15-year old seemed nothing short of deranged. On top of it, every reunion attempt had imploded. I had 10 bucks to spare and was just plain curious to see what they could still cough up.<br /><br />There may not be another colossal track like \\"Panama\\" here, but this ain't a softie album either. Once you're past \\"Tattoo\\", the love-it-or-hate-it ultra classy pop opener, ADKOT is ferocious, incessant, and masterfully played. For starters, I would have NEVER thought Eddie still had those solos in him, that technique, and still the trademark magma-heavy chording. Whether or not you like ADKOT, Eddie's guitar playing is back with a vengeance. But it ain't all good news with him. And my biggest quibble is with the riffs. There are no truly memorable riffs jump-starting these songs. They're only decent.<br /><br />This is where the rest of the band save the day. The next revelation is Alex. His drumming actually seems better (!) and fearsomely tight. He's top notch on the speed freak songs and powerful yet resourceful on the rest. As for Dave, well, he's always been a greater mc than a singer, and I enjoy the flair, insight, and zaniness. They're intact and he seems, like the rest of the band, inspired by the reunion. His voice has dropped a tad, but nothing worrying (although you don't hear the characteristic yelp he would let out in the early days).<br /><br />In all, despite the relative heaviness of the album, there's a strong positive, even buoyant vibe running through it. And that's certainly reminiscent of the VH of old.<br /><br />If there's one thing to be said about ADKOT is that the boys took it seriously. Eddie cleaned himself up and rehearsed properly, Dave shook off the mediocrity that had tainted his solo work, and the songs range from solid to strong,without a clunker in sight. On the other hand, in every Van Halen album from the first period, there was at least one undisputed classic song, if not more. No classics here (although \\"Stay Frosty\\" may be a candidate). However, I'm already waiting for the follow-up and hope it will show its face there.<br /><br />Well done, lads.
0312084986|5.0|James Herriot wrote these amazing books and still today, they ring true with joyous warmth, humor, and sadness. The characters are lively, funny and instantly memorable, and though I first read these books in the late 1970's, they still lift my spirits today. I highly recommend the entire series for anyone who loves animals.

Kind of an H.G. Wells \\"pastiche\\"?

0449011917|3.0|This isn't about the book - this is about the audiobook. I listened to all 3 until FfC and absolutely LOVED Roy Dotrice. I was used to Jim Dale's style, but of course Dotrice is more grownup. Anyway, I started Feast for Crows, and this very pleasant-voiced narrator is very very appropriate to Young Adult fiction. I miss Dotrice's gravelly voice.

0446547654|3.0|Anyone who reads Nicholas Sparks knows what they're in for. His writing style, like many authors before him, is predictable (and predictably reassuring). When I want a story of long-lost love, true-love tortured by fate or love twisted away by the hands of circumstance and time, I turn to this author. And he always delivers.<br /><br />The story of Dawson and Amanda is appealling. Dawson, in my opinion, is a more likeable, solid character than Amanda, who seems too wishy-washy and confused to arouse my sympathy. But Dawson, well, this is the sort of Southern man, content in the knowledge of who he is without pretending, that we all like to read in Sparks' books. No doubt, Mr. Sparks knows that women are drawn toward the rock solid hero, the man who has a hard-chiseled sense of self, and that is why we go back to him time and again.<br /><br />I don't mind being drawn into the predictable ... I find it comforting. I did, however, mind the ridiculously contrived series of events that lead up to the ending .... it's as if all the planets in the entire universe aligned at the exact moment that these characters needed them to in order to produce the \\"you've got to be kidding me\\" ending.<br /><br />I love New Bern. I love Nicholas Sparks. But let's hope that his next book is predictably reassuring, without compelling us to slap our foreheads in punishment at the end.

It would have been sooner if I hadn't gone to work, but yeah, it was that amazing! This story is unlike any I've ever read and it opened my eyes to another side of sexuality I hadn't considered and much less explored. Now I am more than intrigued and I'm ready ready to meet my own dark goddess. I've got installment 2 and 3 on my wish list and I can't wait to pick up where it left off. I loved every word!

B00008DDSC|5.0|This is a beautiful and unconventional little movie.  Surreal yet profound it digs around in the heart of sexual emotion, desire and love, and perhaps most unusually, devotion.  It never falls prey to stereotype of pre-prescribed ideas of what those things are and often seems to be exploring them for the first time.  What a breath of fresh air.  I loved this movie. Dynomite performances by Spader (who's still got that tweaked charm) and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's very moving and very likable.  Finally though this movie's got a sense of humor under all the rage of desire on a low boil.  It's almost a dark comedy, if not for the fact that it touches on some very real issues of the heart. Bravo!

B005S9EJZA|4.0|If you're in the mood for an estrogen-soaked weeper, here is another Nicholas Sparks (\\"The Last Song\\") novel...you know, all swoony... with bayous. They contrived a \\"Notebook\\"-type scene in a shower stall instead of a rainstorm, but Zac Efron and Taylor Schilling will never be Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams! They might be as pretty, but these PG-13 love scenes are endless! Where is the fast-forward on my remote when I need it! Amazon will let me know when the DVD is available.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailers, you know we start in a war zone with Zac, a corporal in a Marine platoon that is ambushed. By the time the dust settles, he is resting beside the rubble and sees something glint in the sunlight. As he goes over to pick up a snapshot of a pretty woman, a mortar hits right where he had been; the photo literally saves his life. He doesn't know who dropped it and has a devil of a time trying to figure out who the pretty woman is so he can thank her.<br /><br />Here is the attractive cast:<br />  * Zac Efron (\\"17 Again\\") as our hero Logan, tracks down the mysterious lovely young woman from that photo. Efron is still trying to reboot his career after the \\"High School Musical\\" franchise. His movies are squeaky clean and he is nicely buffed, but his love scenes don't generate much heat; he can only look sincere and earnest for so long....<br />  * Taylor Schilling (\\"Atlas Shrugged, Part I\\") as Beth, a divorced mother who runs a professional dog training facility and boarding kennel with her grandmother. She is troubled by the rumor that her brother was killed by friendly fire.<br />  * Blythe Danner (\\"What's Your Number\\") as Ellie, the wise and witty grandmother. She hires Logan over Beth's objections, then smiles as our two leads predictably fall in love.<br />  *Jay R. Ferguson (Lots of TV) is Keith, a small-town cop who shares custody of their boy with Beth, but suffers from an overdose of testosterone.<br /><br />Director Scott Hicks (\\"No Reservations\\") has captured the challenges of post-war adjustment by showing our hero's reaction to video games and unexpected situations without making them the central theme of the movie. I appreciate that: it's believable without being melodramatic.<br /><br />As our hero decompresses, we get snippets of a bucolic rural life being lived at a slower pace. There is a sweet scene in a church where Logan, at the piano, accompanies a little boy playing a violin, in a simple rendition of \\"In the Garden.\\" Very nice....captured the challenges of post-war adjustment by showing our hero's reaction to video games and unexpected situations without making them the central theme of the movie.

B005LAIHAY|2.0|Luc Besson (\\"The Professional\\") is known internationally as a masterful screenwriter, director and producer of witty, gritty action flicks. As a result, this Besson-written and produced PG-13 film is specifically for fans of witty gritty action flicks! We see non-stop action with no sweaty bodies, no profanity, lots of grit, gunfire and blowie uppie stuff, and as for wit... the flimsy plot is laughable.<br /><br />As expected in a Besson flick, we are quickly thrown into a (CGI) action-filled opening sequence in an unnamed city; the remainder of the witty gritty action takes place in a high-security prison facility orbiting Earth. Prisoners are placed in stasis and \\"stored\\" for the duration of their sentences. Problem is, they are hard-core offenders and the lengthy suspended animation tends to cause mental disorders. This means by the time they revolt and take over the prison, most of them are bonkers.<br /><br />These witty, gritty folks try to make it happen:<br />  * Guy Pearce (\\"The King's Speech\\") is witty as Snow, wrongfully convicted of espionage, sent to retrieve information about a mysterious briefcase which seems to contain something important. Some of his terse one- and two-word responses made me laugh out loud.<br />  * Vincent Regan (\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\") is gritty as Alex, leader of the prison rebellion. He is NOT witty.<br />  * Maggie Grace (\\"Knight and Day\\") is pretty as Emilie, a doctor trying to investigate the effects of stasis on the prisoners; she is taken hostage. Oh, she is also the daughter of the President.<br /><br />If you get the DVD from Amazon.com, you'll see that much of the action consists of running through dark metallic corridors, dodging bullets, ducking through airlocks, and climbing up ductwork. It gives you ample time to admire Guy Pearce's newly bulked-up body; it makes him look like one of the Wahlbergs. Not a bad thing...<br /><br />Did I mention there is a LOT of action? And wit? And grit?
B0051QIGP4|4.0|The second cd tepid club mixes and the album art kinda gross but also interesting somewhat. For the music, IMMENSE IMPROVEMENT! I really enjoyed the thoughtful,often intense emotional, even spiritual context Lady sings in. Even beyond the commercial tracks there is a consistent theme thoughtful and mature theme going on. This is the kind of music lady gaga that I know Lady Gaga is for and I.m quiet impressed by it and I find the whole album enjoyable and satisfying. I like the artwork that says 'This album is for you.' Indeed, I connect with this album. Well done!

0307956350|2.0|This new author shows some promise, and the writing isn't as bad as the usual thriller-factory dreck, but unfortunately that's not enough.  The book is written with a truly inane (I'd almost say \\"insane\\") use of flashbacks that makes it almost unreadable. And until the very end, the pace is so slow that you'll find yourself checking page numbers to see how far you've gotten.  Finally, the constant internal monologue of the protagonist sounds like a pity party at a Girl's Night Out.<br /><br />But that said, there's just enough here to make me willing to give Pavone one more try to get it right.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is completely wonderful! I definite must read and good for all ages and either male or female. It follows a female but it isn't super girly nor is it really a romance or anything. Highly recommend it!
0553381695|5.0|After having read the first book, Game Of Thrones, I was excited to pick up where it left off and travel to the lands of Westero once again. I was not disappointed. This book, for me, was a first rate sequel to the first. I am anxiously waiting for number three to come to my mail box so I again, can find out what happens next.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first book, you will no doubt, become entrenched with how the story continues. There are many twists and turns in the plot and nothing is ever as it seems. That seems to be the running theme chapter after chapter, when you get comfortable with an idea, or where a certain character is going, it changes, leaving you jaw dropped and flipping the pages to find out what is next in the continuation of the story.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Jon, Tyrion Lannister, Arya and Bran. Yes, a Stark lover, and for Stark lovers, this book gets really rough-it's a struggle for all of the Starks and for Winterfell. With Tyrion, you can never tell what's up his sleeve and I love that about him. In this book, their tales abound rich with details and atmosphere. For an 800 or so page book, it was too short!! I wish that it had gone on for another two hundred pages! Nothing is seriously wrapped up in this book. You will be groping for the next book right away because of that fact. You will also be wanting justice, but whether or not it comes, remains to be seen.<br /><br />I have ordered the third and it's been almost a week. I hope it comes soon so that I can delve back into the journey. I love this series with all the adventure and crazy twists and turns. The characters are great, even when they are villainous. When they are villainous, it's so fun to hate them. Martin has created a great world where good guys, bad guys and creatures roam and fight and love and live and the reader goes on a huge roller coaster ride, up and down and back up again...<br /><br />The first half of this book is good, the second half is great, and like I said, you will probably be like me and wish that it had been longer. As a plus side to reading the George R. R. Martin series, this book was literally smoking in my hands as I finished it.like I said, you will probably be like me and wish that it had been longer.

B003K16P3M|2.0|Well.<br /><br />Usually, even if a book isn't that great, it doesn't bother me so much as bores me.  This book was interesting in that it annoyed me constantly.  It seemed like every page, some character was being ridiculous - and with the main character, Katsa, being a complete moron and stubborn mule, this was quite often!<br /><br />Katsa.  Ugh, this is one of those people who needs a good slap upside the head every few minutes to keep her on track with reality.  Her decisions are more selfish than not, and woe be the person who tells her she is wrong, or that there is a better way than hers.  Katsa really ruined this book with her mannerisms, without which this could have been a 2-3 star book.  You can blame it as just being character quirks, but let me tell you, an egotistical, stubborn, whiny woman does not make for a character that is worth reading.<br /><br />Po.  Po was, for the most part a good character, but the author decided to feminize him to the point that he wasn't much of a man anymore.  There were a few situations he was placed into to make you think he was manly still, but they were too little too late.  He was bearable, though - and due to his presence, the book was also bearable.  If he had been any worse off, I'm not sure I could have finished this book.<br /><br />The other characters (except Bitterblue and Leck) blended into one another, and were forgotten to me other than their names.  I often had to refer back to my own notes to remember who Randa or Raff were, for example.  Bitterblue was another odd character.  I think in future novels she'll be nice to have around, but her transformation during this book was quite dramatic, and I'm not sold on how quickly/easily it took place.  Leck made for a great bad guy, but I felt that the author was afraid to go into much detail about exactly why he was so bad.  I have my suspicions, and believe I am guessing right, but there was heavy smoke clouding the details of his dastardly deeds.<br /><br />Time was an issue for me in this novel.  I could not for the life of me figure out when the time lapses were happening until well after the events which transpired.  There was a boat trip, for example, which to me felt like a few days, perhaps a week - but later, it is clarified that it was several months.  This happened to me quite often, and I found it off-putting.  Also, in terms of time - I encountered small discrepancies here and there with tense shifts that weren't quite right.  Sentences which shifted to and fro like the tide.  This wasn't a constant problem, but seemed to happen at least in one sentence per chapter or so.<br /><br />I liked the idea of the book, if it was a little unbelievable at how inexperienced the characters were with something they had possessed their entire lives.  There was also no explanation to why some were stagnant and others were evolving.  While the character may or may not be privy to this information, it would have been nice to have had the system laid out for the reader a bit more.  More history about Graces would have been nice as well.<br /><br />As I read in other reviews prior to reading the book myself, the events were indeed a bit bland overall.  One reviewer wrote something I found to be quite true for my experience:<br /><br />\\"The basic plot of Graceling goes like this:<br /><br />MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK DRESSES SUCK HAIR SUCKS MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK HORSEBACK RIDING MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK SEX SEX SEX MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK HORSEBACK RIDING MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MARRIAGE SUCKS KIDS SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK MEN SUCK\\" - [...]<br /><br />I gave it 1.5 stars.  If Katsa had had a less annoying personality, it might have gotten 2.5-3 stars.I could not for the life of me figure out when the time lapses were happening until well after the events which transpired.

0385344228|5.0|It is difficult to imagine anything more disturbing than the murder of a 14-year-old boy. And this is the consensus of the residents of a quiet suburban community in Middlesex County, Mass. Nothing would ever be the same again. Some events are too haunting to let go, ever.<br /><br />Ben Rifkin's body was found in the park, lying face down on an embankment just off one of several paths that many students use to travel to and from school every day. He was stabbed three times. The wounds were purposeful, awkwardly angled so the serrated blade could slip between the ribs.<br /><br />When someone finally found the body, the nearby school was immediately placed on lockdown. The students were ordered back to their home rooms, doors locked. The teachers held them there for hours until the all clear was finally given.<br /><br />In the days that followed, the school grounds became a carnival. Every parent would elect to drop their children off at school. News crews would set themselves up in the parking lot, looking for reactions. Police officers would be stationed at the entrance and along the grounds. Parents would loiter outside, uncertain how long it would take to feel safe leaving any of them while a murderer was in their midst...<br /><br />I'm not one to dive into any book described as a courtroom crime thriller. But there is much more to be found here because Landay fully realizes Andy Barber and his perception of the people around him. While infusion of Barber is so complete some readers will say some parts are better than others, those feelings probably have more to do with how we feel about Barber than the story. The book is near perfect from start to finish, impossible to predict, and difficult to put down once it gets going.

You have to love that classic metal with the early twin guitar attack. It fit right in with my love of Saxon. Restless and Wild along with Russian Roulette both are also excellent albums.<br /><br />  Now the Udo era is gone and Accept is back with a vengence with their last two releases Blood of The Nations and Stalingrad which are huge and without a doubt the best two albums from this band.

B007UXSPK2|2.0|I'm surprised by the relatively high ratings. The writing was Sci-Fi Channel level and a big disappointment for a movie of this magnitude. Renner's character was a waste of his serious talent, and the computer geek and the girl were the same 2 generic characters you've seen in a million movies.<br /><br />The writing was very thin for a movie of this proportion. The action was there, the technology was impressive, the acting was fine, but nothing interesting and compelling was happening. The wheels were turning, but the car wasn't moving.<br /><br />It was \\"formula\\" Hollywood movie making.<br />Handsome leading man...check.<br />Handsome popular costar (Renner)...check.<br />Geeky, witty sidekick...check.<br />Attractive female sidekick........who is also a martial arts expert who can destroy men twice her size......check.<br />This was Hollywood at its worst. Yes, the technology and effects, Hollywood's strength, were outstanding, but to no avail.<br /><br />Another gripe - we never got to know, and hate, the bad guy. He was just this distant, uninteresting character who was never really developed. This is the same actor who was outstanding in the European version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />In the end it got cheesy and I even rolled my eyes a few times. This was not a terrible movie, but considering the 2 big actors, and the budget this movie would have had, it should have been much \\"smarter\\" and more compelling than it actually was.

B003EYVXV4|3.0|Warning:  I will make no attempt to avoid spoilers here.<br /><br />After all the hype about this new dystopia, I found it rather disappointing for the most part.  This film is in 3 parts.  The first is to show the condition of the fenced-in proletariat worlds, which house slave laborers to a distant city.  It is realistic and well acted, a brutish existence with a great risk of chance, the games, which are designed to channel yet truncate hope.  That they choose children to kill eachother off is almost believable.<br /><br />Second, there is the new seemingly totalitarian aristocracy.  This is the weakest part of the film.  The collective baddies are walking caricatures, two-dimensional at best, but over-acted with an absurdity that isn't clever.  It's just odd looking.  Now a radically different future as parody, such as that in Fifth Element, can definitely work - what it takes is great imagination that weaves the details into a coherent vision, where questions have implied answers (think Dreyfus' bizarre behavior in Close Encounters).  It fails to make sense on an intuitive level that the viewer can accept without question.  Unfortunately,  the \\"city\\" simply appeared insipid, like someone made it up without thinking.  Perhaps I am asking too much, I had hoped for a masterpiece like, say, the heavily atmospheric Children of Men.  Woody Harrelson's character, as a mentor to Katniss as she develops her gladiator skills, is the only redeeming feature that truly works in this section.  It is a botched opportunity.<br /><br />Third, there is the game.  This is by far the strongest portion of the film, the core that brings out the strengths of character and body.  Katniss here is absolutely wonderful, played by a gifted actress with psychological nuance and desperate intelligence.  I was completely convinced by her plight and enjoyed her journey of self discovery.  She keeps her human compassion, doesn't shed her emotion even when asked to kill, and is willing to risk everything for another.  It is beautifully done.  The surprise resolution was also excellent, with the boy from her district delivering a moving performance.  This was worth the price of admission.  The conclusion, which reveals some of the politics of the \\"city\\", is somewhat better than the earlier portion, but again, the characters are too weak to be truly interesting to the point that they would enter the viewers' imagination.<br /><br />I would say this is a 3.5-star film.  Recommended overall.everything for another.  It is beautifully done.  The surprise resolution was also excellent, with the boy from her district delivering a moving performance.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|I loved the first MI, which warped the TV program with Jim Phelps' true character coming out as a total surprise that kept you guessing till the end and yet can be watched over and over.  2 and 3 essentially made Cruise into a superhero, creating a role he could plod through with as much interest as a clod.  While he is still somewhat of a superhero for this one, there is no question that it is best since 1.<br /><br />Released from prison by a lovely agent, Hunt is immediately entrapped in some kind of web he has to figure out.  The entire MI force is disavowed, so he has no resources but those of his immediate team, which includes a new techie, a mysterious diplomat, and the tough chick.  It is a rollicking good ride and I will definitely buy it once the price falls.  The feats are just believable enough, things keep going wrong, and it is more complicated (yet ever so close) to disaster.  I was not bored for a minute, never lapsed into \\"some guy is just making this up\\" mode, and wondered what was really going on for most of it.  That is success.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00786XVOG|5.0|Last night Saturday April 28th, 2012 me and my wife attended Yanni's live show here in Louisville Kentucky at the Louisville palace Theater. We've been listening to and own every Yanni CD and DVD and after for the first time seeing his show i can definitely say that he's even better live. It was an excellent show. One of his keyboards broke during the performance but they played it off so well and instead of stopping the show he just went over to the piano and played something else until the keyboard was fixed. Anyway the tracks on the Live in Puerto, Rico are the same tracks played at our concert and i highly recommend the buying of this cd/dvd, it really was a wonderful show experience.
0688145078|5.0|I bought this book, along with the Ronne Randall one, for my 3-year old son when I was pregnant with his brother. At first, my older son wasn't into the idea of having a baby around at all; part of what helped him a)understand what was going to happen, b) prepare mentally and emotionally for it, and c)get excited about being a big brother and understanding what babies can and cannot do, were these two books.<br /><br />This one in particular got my son excited to have a baby in the house. In fact, in the weeks leading up to our baby's birth my son loved to quote the book and tell people that the baby would not be able to walk, or to talk, or to eat pizza. I liked that this book focused on how bringing a baby into the home would change our family dynamic, but in a good way.<br /><br />I definitely credit this book, and the Ronne Randall one, with making life easier for all of us upon the birth of our second child, and for how well our older son has been dealing with the new baby (nearly 8 weeks now).<br /><br />(Part of this review cross-posted for Ronne Randall's \\"I'm a Big Brother!\\" book: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144547008X/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img)

I finished it in a matter of days, two words could describe this book for me HOT and YUMMY!  While at first the book is a little slow going, then it gets a little weird (contract part) then it is hard core (no pun intended) from that point forward.  It keeps you on your toes .. when is the next \\"encounter\\"? Where does the red room come in? Where can I find Christian Grey? Where is their relationship going?<br /><br />There are also moments I must admit, that brought back personal memories for me so it made the book that much more enjoyable. Ms. James put a lot of detail in this book with the people and actions that take place. I would recommend this book to anyone ... keep them coming Ms. James!

B005LAIHAY|3.0|- Emilie Warnock, the President's daughter (when apprised that his dad had deployed Snow): \\"Did he leave a message for me?\\"<br />- Snow: \\"Yeah, you're adopted.\\"<br /><br />Luc Besson, French purveyor of fanciful adventure cinema, in his long career has treated his movie-going audiences to enough thrills that surely we can forgive him his occasional fumble. Not every venture could be as delectable as THE FIFTH ELEMENT or TAXI or DISTRICT B13. Every now and then - okay, check out this forced imagery - he'll mine his belly button of inspiration and come up with nothing but old lint. So relish LOCKOUT as diverting fluff. Australian actor Guy Pearce gets a chance to play the scruffy, mouthy action hero part. Except that I lay you odds Snake Plissken or John McClane can chew him up and spit him out.<br /><br />In the near dystopian future, a few decades from now, a disillusioned ex-government agent named Snow (Pearce) is framed for murder and sentenced to cryogenic statis on M.S. One, an outer space maximum-security penitentiary orbiting Earth. And on M.S. One, Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace), idealistic daughter of the 56th American President, is visiting on a goodwill tour when the convicts are mysteriously released from their suspended animation, and so cue the mass rioting and an explosion of orange. This then grants Snow a last moment reprieve. For certain considerations from the government, Snow is tasked with infiltrating M.S. One on a suicidal one-man rescue operation. Except that Snow, not really all that patriotic, is fueled by an ulterior motive.<br /><br />LOCKOUT spotlights actors who aren't (yet) top drawer, but that's okay, for the most part. The story is constructed around an old premise - the prison breakout - and embellished with that outer space twist. There's a nice grungy vibe to the film, probably because most of the action takes place on the floating prison populated by criminals suddenly run amok. But even on the ground, we get a peek at the submerged Oval Office, transformed into an underground bunker, and we understand that this world has gone to crap. Just maybe, Snow is entitled to his subversive attitude.<br /><br />On board the prison, Snow's mission immediately fubars, primarily because his sneak tactics aren't exactly at ninja levels. In a way, it makes the film more interesting because it underscores how vulnerable and unprepared Snow is. He's no master spy. He's no precise tool. He's a clumsy sledgehammer. While capable and gutsy enough, his actions are dictated more by the whims of outside forces rather than his clear vision and ability to impressively execute operations. He can improvise a bit.<br /><br />It's a story that presents intriguing selling points, but, ultimately, it fails to deliver on them payoff moments. If you've seen one DIE HARD variant, you've pretty much seen them all. Dampening my enthusiasm even more is Guy Pearce's overwritten character, in the sense that the writers have overindulged with the wisecracks. Snow throws out so many one-liners (only some of which are funny), and so frequently, that it undermines the plot. But, hey, not everyone can be as on point as John McClane. And even McClane launched his quips in moderation.<br /><br />As much as Maggie Grace lights up the screen with her good looks, her performance comes off as bland. There was a more palpable sense of jeopardy when she played the abducted daughter in [[ASIN:B001TODCII Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)]]. I was distracted by the forced banter between her and Snow. I thought the heavies were creepy, both the sensible but subtly disconcerting Vincent Regan and the filmy-eyed, indecipherable nuttter Joseph Gilgun. Peter Stormare as the bullying Secret Service agent, Langral, could also be viewed as a major antagonist.<br /><br />Apropos of whatever, I don't think that lighter was showcased nearly enough. Hey, maybe it's significant!<br /><br />Possibly the thing that annnoys me most is the trap that was staged to catch the culprit of Snow's frame job. I strongly feel that no self-respecting villain of average smarts would get tricked silly like that.<br /><br />Still, I'm not not recommending LOCKOUT. It's good for a rental or, better yet, good for when it's available on cable. Guy Pearce's Snow does get his opportunities to demonstrate his action hero creds. Pearce imbues his character with personable grittiness and pragmatism. It's too bad the plot doesn't support him, that the special effects tend to be mediocre, that the narrative starts out promisingly but then descends into something generic and uninvolving.

0345803507|5.0|This is THE best romance trilogy I have ever read.  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.  I loved it so much in fact that I bought hard copy just so I can go back to it anytime at home, I also have ibook version on the iphone, so I can read in public anytime I want!  The writing itself gets redundant in some parts.  Christian being \\"mercurial\\" for example.  But it is a great story line.  I believe that women fall in love with this trilogy because Christian is \\"all in one\\"  package.  He is the men that we see in our dreams since we were little girls playing \\"marriage\\".  He is beautiful, caring, loving, crazy at times, demanding, jealous and possessive yet allows Anastasia to make her own decisions and has eyes only for her.  He is confident and when he means no...he means no...Caring, loving, controlling but gentle and a superman in bed...(makes Anastasia orgasm each and every time, lol) Who wouldn't want a men like that?  Shall I add a millionaire as well??  He is the ultimate fantasy.  It doesn't hurt that the book gives plenty of ideas to spice up couples sex life.  Plenty of pages that will make anyone blush, especially if reading in public...I know!!!! ...And I have two kids....  My husband enjoys the benefits of me reading it.  Highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 18!  I feel empty now that I have finished reading all three books!  I am longing for more!!!  Please E. L. James, continue with the story line, or write a new trilogy about another couple!  Meanwhile I will just keep re-reading  all three. I would love to see more of these books written from Christian's point of view.  It makes it more raw and funny, plus it was great to see what he was thinking and compare to how Anastasia was regarding their first encounters. (last chapter of the Fifty Shades Freed)  I absolutely loved it.  If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Since the story is true, I knew as I read that Shin is now free, that he escaped from an incomprehensibly horrific place, where human life is far less valuable than sewing machines, pigs, or five kernels of corn. But knowing Shin is free doesn't dilute the hell he lived in - in fact, it underscored the hopelessness of the lives of hundreds of thousands of North Koreans still being tortured, maimed, starved, and overworked in the labor camps.<br /><br />The book overall, seemed to tell the story fairly dispassionately - almost matter of factly.  But that also seemed exactly right.  How else is Shin supposed to deal, even now as he tells about his life, with the endless parade of horror that made up his first 22 years?<br /><br />The parts of the story that touched me the most were when Shin met Uncle and then when he met Park.  Those two men, who somehow found a way to hold onto a spirit of love in the midst of deepest hate, transformed Shin's life.  It's incredible to think that after all his conditioning to be subhuman, simple love and care gave him a glimpse of his humanity and a deep desire to escape.  If it weren't for Uncle and Park, Shin's story would not be.<br /><br />Shin's ability to function in the outside world, once he escaped, was equally intriguing. I found it so telling that the relative \\"freedom\\" of the non-camp North Korea was as shocking to him as anything he saw once he got to South Korea and dealt with the 180-degree differences in lifestyle.<br /><br />I hope that Shin's story spreads and gives voice to all the North Koreans, in labor camps and out, who have no way of calling out to the world.  I also hope for Shin that he will find peace within himself, and see that his escape and the gifts of knowledge he received from Uncle and Park, are meant to help those still living in hell.

B004G600A4|4.0|Looking back on my review of the Princess and the Frog, I feel I may have dropped the ball (no joke intended) in one respect.  I didn't give it sufficient credit for the fact that both main characters cared enough about each other to sacrifice themselves; in other words, true love.  I apologize for overlooking this.<br /><br />I only mention this because the very same thing is present to an even greater degree in Tangled; probably one of the better animated Disney movies I've ever seen in my life.  Not top three, certainly, but top ten at least.<br /><br />It's a story about Rapunzel and how she escapes from her tower to find out the secret of the lanterns that rise into the sky each year on her birthday.  In escaping, she enlists the assistance of a thieving, manipulative, philandering bandit named Flynn Ryder (he gets better,) and has to struggle to keep from being dragged back to the tower by the hag Gothel, who's been using her magic hair to stay young.<br /><br />Tangled has everything.  There are scenes with fun, fast-paced action and adventure, scenes with pure comedy, heartwarming scenes, goofy scenes, romantic scenes, tragic scenes, etc, and sometimes, a little overlap.  There are running gags that travel through the whole movie, characters who always bring a little levity to the scenes they're in, and Rapunzel's mile-long hair is easily as eye-catching and fun to watch in action as the balloon house from \\"Up.\\"<br /><br />The horse Maximus is one of the coolest and funniest characters I've ever seen.  Utterly wordless, unquestionably upright and unshakably determined to see justice done, and yet, he pulls it off with a sort of goofy seriousness rivaling the vorpal bunny from Monty Python.  No matter what scenes Maximus is in, it always benefits from having him in it.  In fact, I'd say he's probably the best enforcer that the royal guards have at their disposal.<br /><br />Gothel is a surprisingly well-done villain.  She might be a witch, but there's no indication of it.  She never uses any magic.  She's just crafty and manipulative, and really, when you think about it, that's all that most real villains are too.  On top of that, having very little power makes it much more of a challenge to write for a villain, and yet, in a sense, much more rewarding.  Coming up with schemes for an intelligent villain requires intelligent writers, and I absolutely appreciate the effort that was put into this.<br /><br />Rapunzel's real parents never say a word, and neither does her best friend; the chameleon Pascal, but in a way, the fact that they can be so expressive and convey such a breadth and depth of emotions regardless, is itself quite an accomplishment.  I was amazed by just how much was accomplished with these characters, without ever saying a word.<br /><br />Flynn and Rapunzel both have basically the same problem, as characters, unfortunately, and that is that while their relationship is utterly serious in later scenes, they both start out more or less goofy and hyper.  Rapunzel uses a lot of modern, casual, teenagery terminology, and Flynn is even worse in this respect, since he starts out with so many character flaws.  Still, as I said, all of this gets better later on, so it's very well-done.  Flynn is played a little like Bill Murray's character from Groundhog Day.  You don't really like him at first, but as time goes on, he becomes a better person.<br /><br />Rapunzel is a little different in that respect.  She's likable from the very start; quirky and weird in a happy sense.  Energetic, intelligent and imaginative.  However, even she starts out the movie with nothing to really sacrifice, and no one to sacrifice for, and it really helps as the movie progresses, and this gradually changes, until she and Flynn both become truly heroic characters.<br /><br />Flynn is clearly shown stealing, betraying, philandering and so forth, so there's obviously a reason for this to be rated PG, but like I said, these aspects of his character don't last.  I was actually amazed by the quality of the music in this movie.  It's truly awesome; even the instrumental tracks.  In fact, it reminded me a lot of Beauty and the Beast; probably because they got the same guy to do it.<br /><br />The humor in the movie is wacky and weird at times, and very strongly character-driven at other times.  There was no toilet humor, no off-color jokes, etc...  I think that pleased me more than anything.  They had to get away from the Dreamworks/Fox trends of non-funny humor if they wanted to make a real masterpiece, and they did this magnificently.  In fact, I have only two gripes against this film, really.  One small, the other big.<br /><br />The small one is this; I didn't feel that the narration over the beginning and end of the film was helpful.  It's like the king and queen.  The visuals alone would have told me what I needed to know.  Hearing Flynn talking in modern casual slang over them doesn't improve their ability to tell me the story of what happened.  They could still have had narration, though.  Maybe if it was just a more dignified-sounding kind of narrator, like they got for Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />The big gripe is this; something happens to Rapunzel near the end of the film, which drastically alters her appearance, and this truly troubled me.  Granted, this does show Flynn's development as a character more strongly, because it proves his willingness to give his life for her, but I much preferred Rapunzel's quirky looks at the beginning, to her more modern looks at the end.  Still, even this is just a surface-level complaint.  I tend to stop the movie before the ending these days, but if it doesn't bother you as much as it bothered me, have a field day.<br /><br />To sum it up, Tangled is far superior to the Princess and the Frog, and as I said, one of the better Disney films in general.  Watch it for yourself, and then decide what you like and don't like.  Like I said, a few things botheredme, but I still think it was a great flick, and I hope you'll like it as well.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Last night I watched \\"Gettysburg,\\" the story of the greatest battle of the Civil War. Well, what can I say? It already has almost 600 Amazon reviews and a lot of them can only be termed excellent. Read some of the highly-rated reviews. They're very worthwhile. Personally, I thought it was a very fine film. I'm glad I watched it. The production values were high and the acting was good. It gave me a real feeling for the Civil War and the military battles of that time. It was a long film, but well worth the sitting.<br /><br />I've always wondered how the casualty rates on some of these wars of the past could be so astronomical. After watching these fine reenactments, now I understand. It's a long, long way from modern smart bombs, drones and things of that sort. These battles were more like very serious life-and-death brawls. The depiction was excellent. It was bloody and brutal without being sensationalistic. Likewise, the tedium of war came across well. The 20-mile hikes per day and the day after day grind was well presented. It was a very good, very educational movie. It's just one of those movies that all Americans should watch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My Granddaughter loaned me her Hunger game books.<br />I fell in love with the story and characters.<br />The books truly show you what can and will Happen<br /> right here in America if we allow the Elitist to<br />continue on tearing it down and keeping everything<br />politically correct.<br />Had to buy the books for my ipad at Amazon.com because<br />their price was great. They were fun to read a second time.<br /> Linda
B00005J6T0|5.0|This cd, comes really close to greatness of Madonna's Erotica cd.<br />It is a true 1980's classic, from start to end.<br /><br />  This cd, has three epic and beautiful songs 'La isla bonita', 'Papa don't preach' and 'Live to tell'.<br />  Then there is the song 'White heat', with the gangster talking at the begining. This is a great touch.<br /><br />  There are great party songs on here like 'True blue', 'Open your heart', and 'Wheres the party at'.<br /><br />  The remixes on this remaster, are also great. This is a great starter for any one wanting to get in to Madonna. It is just simply great.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book that is hard to put down. And definitely better than the movie. I would recommend it to anybody.
B000078DOH|3.0|I think the fact that The Red Hot chilli Peppers, got George Clinton, to lay down some funk is geat . George, helped produce this cd.<br /><br />  The first six songs are awesome. My favorites are 'Jungleman','Hollywood (Africa)'. Also the remake of Sly And The Family Stones, 'If you want me to stay', is also great.<br /><br />  However the other songs like 'Sex Rap', are just okay. I would only get this, if you are a true Chilli Peppers, fan.
1439177783|5.0|What I find so enlightening is not the CrazyCrazy that plagues the girl with the eating disorder... That's been written about plenty.  What's so interesting, and so helpful for someone struggling with body image, are the things that were said to this gorgeous, thin, conventionally-attractive blonde woman about her appearance; things that have stuck with her throughout her life, just like those criticisms all us *normal* people carry with us.  The modeling agent who told her her 13-year-old ass was saggy, the friend who told her she looked \\"normal, healthy,\\" the manager who told her she had big legs.  Anyone who's struggled with body image can recall a series of incidents when this or that was said, and we hold the handful of nasty remarks as *truth* and disregard the compliments (however abundant) as insincere flattery, as wishful thinking.  It's therapeutic to learn that even the beautiful Portia de Rossi has been forced to endure such things.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love love love love love love love love love love love this game. it is perfect for the rode cause you will never get bored.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|OK, this is a great product, so my suggestion amounts to a petty peeve, but one that Canon can fix with just a slight mod to the grip case. With the grip installed, the 7D body with a lens mounted will no longer stand (with stability) on its base. So, we end up setting the camera down on its left side (portrait position). This means that part of the weight of the camera is now on the end of the mounted lens. Not much weight, but why have any weight on the lens?  If the left end of the grip was squared off, or had two rubber feet, the body would (with many lighter lenses) again stand on its own.  Here is an opportunity for a little aftermarket add-on !
0060263857|2.0|My son needed this book fast. I was pleased to find the book in hard cover and color. Unfortunately, when we received the book it was not in color. I ended up having to go all over town looking for it. Book was in mint condition, but not color. Disappointed.
0446572993|1.0|Though an entertaining read, it was preposterous. It would help if there was one iota of plausability, believability or remote reality to the plot. There is a cottage industry of books/movies focusing on  the lone hero against an omniscient, all powerful and corrupt renegade element of the American intelligence community. Obviously it sells. Reading any fact-based books about the CIA, FBI -like those written by Tim Weiner-show the truth. Usually the spooks are the gang that couldn't shoot straight.<br /><br />Though a fun read, I was usually going, \\"yeah right\\".
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is what it says...just basic solitaire.  No fancy bells or whistles. You can pick a few options on different ways to play. Perfect for kids.
0545265355|5.0|Excellent Read!!  Great price and fast shipping.  Just loved the books, couldn't put them down.  The author made the characters so real and the story line was exciting.  I would recommend these books to anyone who likes a story that moves right along and keeps you immersed in the tale.  I can't wait to see the movie now!
B005IKZ60G|4.0|This album is good. Majority of songs are good. Guetta does not disappoint. :) Better to buy the album than per song for better value.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I just got my kindle fire about a week ago and I'm super stoned that they have this app because its not only addicting but fun, interactive, simple, and most of all...food for the brain. Visually stimulating! #addicted
0062011847|2.0|I wish this book had shown that years of experience have honed and shaped Pratchett's skills into a masterpiece.  I wish I could like this book and recommend it to new readers.  But instead I'd encourage anyone new to go read the other novels where Pratchett has done it before, and done it better.<br /><br />Every element of this story has been done in past novels and by now, these elements are getting tired.  Just like in the Fifth Elephant our old pal Samuel Vimes goes on vacation but like every other Vimes novel he can't give up being a copper so he inevitably uncovers a crime against, well not humanity but goblinity, and just like in Unseen Academicals and various novels involving dwarves and trolls our protagonist proves to the world that every race has wonderful attributes and is worthwhile.  We've got another overpowered ally to help him in this story.  Past OP allies have included Carot, Angua, golems, the nac mac feegle, the luggage, and this novel turns the character of Willikins from a butler with some interesting side talents into a utterly deadly fighter capable of killing anyone and anything.  The villian isn't as overpowered as most of them largely because he only plays a minor role.  And as he has done several times before Vimes takes a young copper under his wing and teaches him how to be a good copper. And there's 7 or 8 scenes where Vimes grabs someone and hauls them in close and gives them a threatening monologue about how things are going to go.  It gets old really fast.  The plot goes about how you would expect and ends with a scene that would be enjoyable and tense if it wasn't for the fact that we know Vimes is never in any actual danger of dying, the entire scene has no real logic behind it (I'll avoid spoilers and just ask why would anyone put themselves into suicidal danger just to transport a cargo quickly when there's no real benefit to doing so).  Our hero triumphs of course and the Discworld gets another point in its Tolerance rating.There's a very small side plot with Colon but the entire side story could be removed from the book without any noticeable effect.  And finally I wish I was being sarcastic when I state that Vimes magically gains some superpowers, but sadly it's not a joke.  No longer needing his natural abilities to solve problems Sir Samuel now has magical powers to help him.  *sigh*<br /><br />Now, of course, if this was another author this might be a decent book, perhaps even a good one.  It's still a Terry Pratchett novel and has some clever jokes and lines.  But overall it's just depressing to see such a poor offering from an author that used to regularly produce wonderful books.  It's just a simple fact that when it comes to his old characters of Vimes, Weatherwax, Death, and Rincewind, it's all been done before and there doesn't appear to be anything further to be said.  My only hope is that in the next novel he introduces a new character like he did in The Truth, Going Postal, Monstrous Regiment, and several of his better novels.  So this book get's a sad 2 out of 5 and leaves me with the urge to go read one of the older books.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Game was good until it took 175 hours to collect anything. I was silly and waited that out but now everything is going to take over 215 hours before I can collect. Really sucks.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|Judd Apatow seems to be everywhere these days. If he's not directing, he is writing and/or producing, and quite successfully at that. Jason Segel and Judd Apatown have teamed up before on \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\", which worked out quite well for them, so why not do it again. In the marketing of this movie, a major emphasis was put on the fact that this is \\"from the producers of Bridesmades\\". The latter is of course now the gold standard for smart and funny romantic comedies from Hollywood. Would this movie live up to that standard?<br /><br />\\"The Five-Year Engagement\\" (122 min.) brings the story of Tom (played by Jason Segel) and Violet (played by Emily Blunt), who are in love and decide to get engaged. However, because of circumstances (primarily Violet being offered a significant job opportunity in academics at U of Muchigan), the couple moves away from San Francisco, where Tom was a successful sous-chef, on the verge of making it big as a chef. It comes as no surprise that Tom is deeply unhappy in Michigan, as he cannot find a satisfying position as a sophisticated chef in Ann Arbor. This is the key part of the movie, and in this sense, the movie's title is really misleading. It's not about being engaged or falling in or out of live, but it's about what happens when a guy gives up his career ambitions to allow his girl/gf/fiancee/wife to fulfill HER career ambitions. Much hilarious scenes ensue. At a certain point, Tom admits to Violet that he is deeply unhappy, there is much shouting back and forth, and Tom says \\"I think I want to be alone now\\", at which point Violet leaves their bed, ready to go sleep on the couch. Tom: \\"Where are you going?\\" Violet: \\"But I thought you wanted to have time to yourself?\\" Tom: \\"Yea, I want to be by myself with you here, come back!\\". It's a golden moment in the movie.<br /><br />I don't think I will shock anyone when I say that the movie has a \\"happy ending\\", I mean this IS still Hollywood main fare after all. (Same complaint I have with that other recent excellent romcom \\"Friends With Kids\\".) In the end I guess that's ok. I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, up until the very end when it became very predictable how it all was going to end. But I sensed that the theatre audience really liked the movie. Special mention for Emily Blunt's delightful performance as Violet, simply oozing charm all over. Bottom line: no, this is not as good as \\"Bridemades\\" but then again I think few romcoms will live up to that standard. I quite enjoyed \\"The Five-Year Engagement\\" for what it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!have with that other recent excellent romcom \\"Friends With Kids\\".) In the end I guess that's ok.

0689878451|5.0|This is a great story of a different kind of a family! Children will be introduced to a penguin family, and what penguins do to care for their eggs and hatch them! It is also a \\"different\\" kind of family because it does introduce the idea that baby Tango has two daddies loving him and raising him. I don't think it pushes the relationship as an agenda- to me it comes across more innocently: there just happens to be two male penguins that want to spend time together and raise this egg!<br /><br />People want to criticize the story because one of the penguins now spends his time with a female? It is as if they want kids to know that this is just a phase and that all is right with the world again. I disagree.<br /><br />I truly believe this is a good story for children to learn about differences. It also teaches about the life cycle of penguins. It is a good story of love and I think people need to get out of their grownup minds of \\"agendas\\" and \\"well it's not true anymore\\" and introduce to children and allow them to enjoy it for what it is. At that age their minds are so much more open and accepting, and they will love the story. They will love the penguins, and be happy for the daddies who finally get their own egg!
0439023491|5.0|After reading the first book in the series, \\"The Hunger Games\\", I could not think of how the story can get better.  But, it did.  With the next book in the series, \\"Catching Fire\\", you experience the victory from \\"winning in the Hunger games\\" to the similar dismay of being \\"picked\\" in the reaping.<br /><br />There is a lot of suspensse and anticipation and a lot more action in \\"Catching Fire\\".  It was well-made and well-thought out with the characters being more developed and revealed such as Haymitch.  I believe the movie version will be a huge success just like the \\"The Hunger Games\\".  Reading the book is a treat for those who enjoy \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

B00005JKDR|5.0|Great monster movie for young ones! There might be a couple of scary parts, but overall, cute and funny for young viewers! It actually may help for kids who are scared of the monster who might be in their closet or under their bed! Again, there might be a couple of \\"scary\\" parts, but if a parent is there to talk them through it, it will be a fun family flick! I love it!!!

You are not the only person going through what you are going through, and you are not the only one feeling the way you do. Some are silly, and some are serious, but either way, it's nice to know you're not alone.

0553807919|5.0|So many books have been written about how to parent. This book is one of the top five in my opinion as it is based on the neuro-physiology of children. Parents need to understand that children have a brain and nervous system that is limited and highly sensitive to input from primary relationships. This book acknowledges these facts and gives practical approaches and the reasoning behind the approaches. I wish I had had it with my kids.
0316236535|5.0|I love to share this book with preschool age children.  I bought 4 copies this time to give as gifts.  I love the improved glittery cover.  Books arrived promptly and in immaculte condition.  It is so satisfying to finish the book and the child's response is 'read it again!'.

0525478817|5.0|There is no use denying that this story is a sad one that will make you cry, or want to.  It makes that clear from the first paragraph, from the blurb on the back.  But unlike most books dealing with death or illness or sadness, this one doesn't give you anything you didn't already have going in.  You aren't going to feel any better about yourself afterwards, or any worse.  You won't feel guilty or full of inspired vigor to \\"live\\" or whatnot, just happily (and tearfully) afloat in the sea of menial living and all that has to offer, good and bad: the small worlds we actually inhabit as opposed to the huge ones we imagine.  Maybe ten people make up your world.  And that's pretty amazing if you have that many.  It's lovely and sad and part grief for our own delusions of self grandeur and remorse that we are, undoubtedly, fleeting and have only these moments to share.  If nothing else, you will feel slightly muted because you're reminded once again how life is both BIG and SMALL at the same time and how we are all the only narrators of our own life story.  I started crying like a child around page 200 or so and didn't stop until the end, about an hour ago.  It was an easy, beautiful read.  All John Green books are like this - full of vibrant characters who don't quite speak how teenagers (or anyone) speaks, but instead how we WISH we could and how we THINK we do in our internal narration room... which is why I think it's great literature.  It takes the time to distort things just enough to be true, not quite believable as every-day goes, but utterly true as far as our internal worlds go.  Books are about individuals talking about individuals.  I don't feel that I am being cheated of reality by having the coolest, most profound interpretations of our lives presented.  I work in a high school - and a year can go by before I overhear anything similar to what these kids say \\"aloud\\" but let me tell you, I find their notes to each other everywhere and this is exactly what they \\"think\\" - teens are quite profound.  I have forced the student population to read Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns to great success... and this year, I will add The Fault in Our Stars, though I expect many tear stained copies returned.  The man has a talent, can mix big ideas and classic philosophies with modern sensibilities and make it work.  Teens memorizing poetry enough to quote it back to each other?  Doubtful, but they would in their perfect world... which is what we all want to read about.  That internal perfect world.  Where we live up to our own expectations.  And what is better than having a 15 year old come up to the circulation desk and ask to read T.S. Eliot because it was quoted in the Fault in Our Stars?  NOTHING.  Once again, adult beverages raised in honor of Mr. Green, keeping the caliber high and unexpected.<br /><br />Only complaint is that it is not yet in paperback, and no doubt the parents will complain over another hardcover choice for Summer Reading.

B001NHNG64|4.0|Jack Reacher is walking down the street in downtown Chicago and suddenly finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But if you're Holly Johnson, maybe his timing was just perfect as Jack stepped into the middle of her abduction and was brought along for the ride.<br /><br />I was mesmerized by this story from the beginning as I followed Jack and Holly's journey to figure out what was going on. In typical Reacher form, he deduces the situation based on his unique ability to assembly information.<br /><br />The story does get bogged down, though, with a lot of details and facts I knew wouldn't make a difference for me in tracking the story.  I found myself skimming a lot of material and, by the end, was glad I'd done so because I didn't feel I missed anything. Eliminating that detail might have made this a more taut thriller but I still enjoyed it and found it riveting. Otherwise, this would have been a five-star rated book, in my opinion.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I have been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs since my early teens (now I am sixty). This motion picture entitled JOHN CARTER was so very exceptional that I have seen it 5 times and have already ordered my own BLU-RAY/DVD copy!!!! I cried at the end when John Carter went BACK TO BARSOOM. A fine family film with great visual effects, creatures (Woola and the Tharks, especially), music and a grand sweep of location, location, location. Each member of the cast made me believe in the world that they created and I was a willing participant in the unfolding story. Excellent motion picture that I want to see again and again in the future. Disney need to make a sequel and TAKE US ALL BACK TO BARSOOM.

City of Bones is a great start, but keep in mind, its a START to an amazing series, and soon to be a major motion Picture, Yay. I hate all the comments i have seen comparing to HP, NOTHING like it. I mean, there is always the good guys, and the bad guys, no matter what form, they are always there if you want interesting stories. So please give this a chance, and i am NOT a teenager, but still enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />I have seen hundreds of thousands of die hard fans of the series, blogs, websites, ect, this series has a huge following, like other famous series HP and Twilight to name a few. So give it a chance, dont go into it trying to pick it apart and compare to other books, just read and enjoy. You wont be sorry.<br /><br />Short summary of [[ASIN:1416955070 City of Bones (Mortal Instruments)]] (no spoilers, just same info on back of book and Amazon)<br /><br />When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder -- much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing -- not even a smear of blood -- to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?<br />This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know. . . .<br /><br />Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.<br /><br />See my book blog for more reviews and extras.

B004HUE57S|4.0|I have the small Verticalmouse 4, right hand version.  This is an overpriced product but it works very well, only reason for 4 stars is the high price.  It is a sensitive and accurate device and it takes little pressure to activate the mouse buttons so you will be accidentally clicking on a lot of things the first 2-3 days you use it.  Hang in there, you will get used to it.  Once I learned that I had to use pressure on the thumb rest to nestle the whole thing back in my palm I got it to work well.  Between the use of this mouse and a soft gel pad under my wrist my wrist pain is pretty much entirely gone, which was of course the reason for getting this odd-looking mouse in the first place.  I would recommend this to anyone that is struggling with wrist pain from using a mouse all day.  I would still wince at the price however.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|What in incredibly heart-wrenching story. Sure it's about the murder of a 14-year old boy, but it's about so much more.  It's about the residual impact of crime, in this case about a murder accusation, but it could be any crime where a family is thought to be guilty by association. The author, William Landay, does a wonderful job combining the investigative and courtroom drama with the more significant human drama that plays out.<br />Highly recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|it was fun but when my sister played back on me it still said it was her turn on mine and no matter how much I refreshed it it still said that. I think it is really fun though and that you should get it.

B001I0T92Q|5.0|Ordered this product last week from eTech and received authentic products. Having read previous reviews about faulty products and durability, I ordered two just in case. First off, I cannot see how anyone could possibly break one of these things. Unless you are personally trying to see if it is flimsy or something like that, I can't see how this would come up. This feels just like my actual Pro Duo card aside from being a bit more hollow towards the middle, which is to be expected considering without the cards inside, it is hollow. Next up, both of the products that I ordered were real, legitimate Photofast CR-5400's and work very well. I personally ordered two 32GB Sandisk MicroSDHC cards, and even though the specs for the product say 'up to 32GB', the PSP shows 59GB available after formatting and all that what not. Overall, great seller, great product. Well recommended to anyone looking to up their PSP capacity without paying for the original overpriced proprietary Sony/Sandisk Memory Gate cards.<br /><br />Edit: Forgot to mention, my only gripe with this is that it isn't like regular pro duo stick in the way it goes in easily and ejects easily. In my PSP 3000 I have to use a pair of tweezers or something similar to get it out if for some reason I need to, but excellent product besides that.

B0053KWDES|4.0|I am not going to comment on the pro's of this device, others have already covered that in detail on here, what I am going to talk about is what you need to do.<br /><br />First, if matching this up with an iPod, iPhone, or iPad, get the the dock connector cable.[[ASIN:B004QVNNI0 FiiO L9 L-Shaped Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]] This will help you get the most out of the device, as it bypasses the logic sent from the devices on board sound processor, and allow the device to enhance your listening experience.<br /><br />Second, use a decent audio file, this device is good but there are limits. When you use this with a bad format, it just makes it sound awful, and why would you spend money on that?<br /><br />Third, get a decent set of headphones, as this cannot make earbuds sound that much better. Why, those have limitations, and it will sound a little better at a low volume. Try to push and it falls apart, much like someone with 2 12 inch subs in the trunk without an EQ check.<br /><br />I recently moved to Spotify's monthly subscription, saved music at their Extreme quality, and the tunes are incredible. This device does improve the sound from portable devices, if connected correctly, and you are using the right tools.

0553384775|5.0|If half of Jordan's stories are only half true, the movie version will be a blockbuster! I recommend this book to anyone who would like to take a humorous break from otherwise technical reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a book I put on my Amazon wish list a while ago. I just downloaded it this weekend, and finished it this morning (Sunday). Hugh Howey has written a dystopian/science fiction masterpiece that any fan of the genres should cherish. Howey's idea is original, the characters are real, the writing is detailed and lively, and it's one of those works you wish would never end. The hope is that Howey will not let it. Read this book.

B002T44ZYW|5.0|This book actually surprised me.  Despite the good reviews, I had low expectations for it.  Lauren might seem very girly and into fashion, but she can write a good novel if she wants to.  This novel hooked me, and I loved it.  I loved the moral of the fable, because one thinks that that the reality shows are peaches and cream, and the reality is another. A short summary,<br /><br />This novel is about Jane Roberts who moves in to Los Angeles with her  best friend Scarlett.  Jane is naturally blonde, cute, makes mistakes with her relationships, a normal person, if you will. Scarlett is gorgeous, opinionated, real smart, and has beautiful black hair. A producer discovers Jane and persuades her into this reality show *with Scarlett* and they meet another two girls, Madison *fake blonde with big boobs and wants to be famous at all costs* and Gaby *real dumb*. Jane and her friend soon find out that that fame comes with a price that she's not prepared to pay.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|Been a Mraz fan since the beginning and it's a special thing to observe the development and maturation of his music career over the years. And yes, it's been a noticeable growth. Each album has a distinct tone and message, a true reflection of his perspective on life at certain points in time. To that end, \\"Love Is a Four Letter Word\\" is, in my humble opinion, his most amazing collection of songs to date, which is really saying a lot. I recommend getting the deluxe version of this album as it contains five bonus live tracks (replete with Jason's characteristic funny commentary in between songs) and the official \\"I Won't Give Up\\" music video. Honestly, the video alone is worth the few extra bucks...stunning cinematography spliced in with haunting images that leave you full of thoughts. That's right, even the video stays with you! \\"Love Is a Four Letter Word\\" has exceeded my every expectation! And the guy behind it is such a breath of fresh air on today's otherwise mundane music scene. Not to mention, his stuff is continually getting better. Favorite lyric: \\"It's like diving into a pool without water and praying for rain.\\" Just listen.
0545265355|5.0|I have to admit, I am not a fan of Science Fiction AT ALL. When the buzz about The Hunger Games first started, I wasn't the first one in line to buy the book or a movie ticket. But, I am a teacher and my middle school students were certainly buzzing. They started reading the books and I wanted to keep up with them. I decided to give the first book a try and I couldn't put it down. I am exhausted at the end of each day, being that I teach all day, tutor in the afternoons, and have busy evenings. But, I found myself staying up late just to get another chapter in. I was hooked! This is definitely a page turner right to the end and I recommend it even to those of you who are not fans of this particular genre.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Norway, 1942. A Nazi special weapons division commanded by Johann Schmidt secures an ancient artifact of unknown origin but incredible power, which they hope to use to power a new, more advanced war machine. At the same time, in New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected from joining the US Army due to a significant number of health issues. Frustrated, he tries to falsify documents in order to enlist. Impressed by his tenacity, Dr. Abraham Erskine instead recruits him for a top-secret programme, designed to create the ultimate soldier using technology. Rogers becomes Captain America, just as Schmidt (adopting the alias, 'the Red Skull') breaks away from his Nazi masters to undertake his own mission of destruction and world domination.<br /><br />Captain America: The First Avenger is yet another piece in Marvel's 'cinematic masterplan', of tying together different characters into a single coherent universe. This plan - which also incorporates Thor, The Incredible Hulk and the two Iron Man movies - culminates in The Avengers, which recently hit cinemas. With Captain America, Marvel resist the urge to bring the character immediately into the present, instead giving him a full origin story set in WWII. This sets the film apart from its contemporaries and allows Rogers' patriotism to be established in full at a time of good vs. evil before bringing him into the murkier present.<br /><br />The film is anchored on Chris Evans's performance as Rogers/Captain America (Evans previously played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four movies), which is decent. A problem with the Captain America character is that unabashed American patriotism isn't a concept that travels well abroad. However, taking a nod from the comics where the same issue has come up a few times over the years, Evans plays the character as a good man who wants to do his part and isn't a blind follower of American policy. Later in the film the character becomes based in London and leads an international team ofagents in taking the fight to the Red Skull, mixing things up in a more interesting manner. A combination of Evans's performance and impressive CGI also totally sells the illusion of the puny, short and unhealthy Rogers in the opening sequences of the film before his transformation into the buff Captain America.<br /><br />Other performances are good, with director Joe Johnston opting for safe and reliable actors in many of the roles: Tommy Lee Jones plays a brash US general who gets the best lines in the movie (as may be expected), with Stanley Tucci bringing eccentricity and humanity to the role of Erskine. Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull and Toby Jones as his sidekick Dr. Zola also form a solid double-act (though Weaving occasionally slips into 'auto-pilot evil', this being a role he could do in is sleep). Hayley Atwell provides solid support as British agent Peggy Carter. The potential for saying something interesting as a British female agent working alongside square-jawed American soldiers in wartime is squandered, however, with Carter characterised as a 'plucky British gal' and not developed much further beyond punching out a solider who makes a sexist comment before she falls for the hero. The ever-reliable Neal McDonough also appears as one of Rogers's international team of agents, though aside from a truly outrageous moustache he is not very distinguishable from the very similar roles he's played before on Band of Brothers and Minority Report.<br /><br />The film adopts a cool retrofuturistic (or 'Americanapunk') tone at times, with Johnston clearly tapping the same well as his entertaining early-career picture, The Rocketeer. There's a playful sense of humour at times, and Captain America deserves some plaudits for being the first contemporary superhero movie to transform into a musical for ten minutes halfway through (rationalised in the storyline). However, its musings on patriotism, warfare and heroism rarely rise above the predictable. The plot is pretty straightforward, although well-paced with some good action sequences. The links to the rest of the Marvel cinematic universe are downplayed to a few appearances by Tony Stark's father and the now-traditional appearance of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the movie's closing moments (interestingly, in the actual finale of the movie rather than a post-credits sequence). This allows the movie to stand alone as an independent piece of entertainment.<br /><br />The film's biggest problem is a total lack of surprise or tension. It's a solidly-made piece of entertainment which relies on its period setting as its sole distinguishing feature from its contemporaries. The actors and director all do good work and it certainly passes the time enjoyably enough, but it lacks long-term appeal.<br /><br />Captain America: The First Avenger (***½) is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray). A sequel is planned for release in 2014.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|The Stranger was recommended to me by my sister. It is a short book that I was able to finish during one airplane ride. It was very slow at the start and parts were quite confusing. Once the story line picked up, I couldn't stop reading. It was a great story, and I appreciated the reality of it.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|George R.R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is the most critically-acclaimed work of epic fantasy since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Over the course of five very large books, it has amassed a large, international fan following. With its adult content, mature themes and focus on well-motivated characters, only HBO was capable of bringing the project to the screen, and fans were delighted when it was announced that they would indeed be handling this adaptation.<br /><br />GAME OF THRONES has to work on two levels: to satisfy the existing fans of the books and also to rope in many new readers unfamiliar with the novels. Broadly speaking, it succeeds. The budget is huge but not infinite and there have been compromises over cost. Most notably, armies rarely feel like they consist of more than 20 people and the direwolves do more closely resemble big dogs than ferocious animals from myth. But on almost every other level the show is a huge success.<br /><br />The casting is almost flawless. Sean Bean brings his world-weary, craggy looks to the role of Eddard Stark and effectively plays him as an older warrior haunted by the decisions of his past. Mark Addy may only be a fraction of the size of Robert Baratheon from the books, but this is forgotten as he nails Robert's ferocious attitude, mixed with a love of wine and women but an unhealthy obssession with the past (which takes the phrase 'rose-tinted spectacles' to a new level). Nikolaj Coster-Waldau nails Jaime's arrogance, whilst Maisie Williams, Isaac Hempstead Wright and Sophie Turner play their roles as the Stark children to perfection. Jack Gleeson sells Joffrey's cruel brutality with aplomb, whilst Conleth Hill is Varys from the books, simply stepped onto the screen and played with total conviction. Likewise superb is Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont, who provides able support to newcomer Emilia Clarke as Daenerys. Clarke has arguably the toughest role of the cast, moving from scared young girl to confident ruler, but manages the task ably. Jason Momoa has little to do as taciturn warlord Khal Drogo, but comes to life in two highly memorable scenes later in the season, whilst Harry Lloyd brings the requisite amount of demented charm to the role of Viserys (one of the few characters much-improved in the transition from book to screen).<br /><br />Michelle Fairley, Lena Headey and Aidan Gillen are also effective as their characters of Catelyn Stark, Cersei Lannister and Littlefinger, but these roles are the ones most notably changed from the book. Catelyn is more predictably reactive than in the books, whilst Cersei has been softened somewhat. More controversial are the changes to Littlefinger, reduced from the master schemer and conniver of the books to a shifty brothel-owner who inexplicably entrusts his motivations to prostitutes he's just met. Gillen does good work in the role, but the Littlefinger of the TV series is a shadow of that in the books.<br /><br />Do we need to say anything of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion save that he is absolutely brilliant? True, he sometimes struggles with the accent, but after a while it ceases to matter (and Tyrion over-enunciating himself to make sure everyone knows he's a noble is something that the character would do) and his Emmy/Golden Globe-winning performance is riveting throughout. His acting partners - Jerome Flynn as Bronn and, in the last two episodes, Sibel Kekilli as Shae - provide able support in his storyline. And of course Charles Dance is just perfect as Tywin Lannister, taking method to a new level when he guts a real (dead) stag live on screen whilst delivering a monologue about his house's power. Kit Harington also makes for an effective Jon Snow, with the other members of the Night's Watch also portrayed with skill (a special mention for Owen Teale as Alliser Thorne, who is much less of a two-dimensional villain than in the books and on-screen becomes someone who, whilst antagonistic, neverthless has a plausible motivation).<br /><br />The writing is, for the most part, decent. Many scenes from the book are translated to the screen with vigour and skill. There are also several new scenes, such as a revelatory conversation between Robert and Cersei, which adds more depth to the story. The biggest issue is with the sex and nudity in the series. Not that it's there - this is a HBO show after all and the books are hardly lacking in it - but that it is often used as a crutch to support scenes of exposition and that it is frequently badly-written. The worst scene of the season is the aforementioned 'Littlefinger explains his character backstory to some random prostitutes' scene, which is cringe-inducing (despite Gillen and Esme Bianco's attempts to sell the dialogue). Whilst these scenes are relatively rare, they do slow the narrative and take time away from more compelling matters elsewhere.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the effects are solid, the (Emmy Award-winning) opening title sequence is amazing and the musical score highly effective.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray presentation is also second to none. The picture quality is crisp and shows off the superb set design and excellent cinematography. The special features are stunning, with particular praise reserved for the in-universe documentaries about the Great Houses (voiced by the castmembers). The episode commentaries are also enjoyable, though not as packed with information as might be wished.<br /><br />Overall, this is a superior season of television, although not quite up there with HBO's best. As (disclosure) the creator of the GAME OF THRONES Wiki and a moderator on Westeros.org I was predisposed to enjoy the series anyway, but in some areas HBO exceeded all my expectations. The weaker elements - the more pointless scenes of sexposition and the entire absence of the powerful flashback scenes, such as the tower of joy sequence (probably the best scene in the book) - are regrettable but, so far, minor.
0307276902|5.0|The author takes readers on a journey starting with the realization that he is in rehab all the way until he is completed with the process. The book is written in a very matter-of-fact way that gets inside Frey's head when he is going through a very rough time in his life. He does a great job of keeping the reader interested by telling the tale in a very vivid format. I can't even imagine going through what he did, but I respect him greatly for it and for sharing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it immensely. It is easy to use and I have not had any glitches. It opens every time,  and you can start right back where you left off. Very enjoyable.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is fantastic! It is a quick read that involves great detail, a thorough plot, and beautifully built characters. The entire book will make you think. It contains violence, drama, love, hate, and almost anything else you can think of. I am not sure how this author came up with all of the intricate details she included, but it was a wonderful start to the trilogy.

0316010669|4.0|This book is extremely interesting and thought provoking.  It is all about a concept called \\"thin slicing\\" which is a fancy term to describe the intuitive first impressions that humans make upon other people.  There are tons of historical facts, astonishing quotes, and scholarly references that will absolutely blow your mind.  This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book, but definitely not my last.

B005MJB7OM|4.0|[[ASIN:B005MJB7OM Pilot [HD]]]I was a fan of the original 1968 series starring Jack Lord; I think Jack would be pleased with the handling of this new version which continues the tradition of law enforcement vs. the bad guys but in a today and now setting.  The actors are new and impressive, like Mr. Caan and Mr. Kim and the chemistry is there between all four actors and the action is of course up to date also.  Enjoyable, intelligent and I'm a fan again.  Enjoy!

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have been a Burrough's fan since I was a teenager, and I was excited when I first heard that Disney was bringing John Carter to the big screen.  Moreover, I was very happy with this movie, and think that it is a shame there will be no sequels, because American movie goers have no taste.  Absolutely fabulous movie!

B007IX383I|5.0|I love older Anathema (Eternity, Alternative 4) but I also love the Anathema of late (A Natural Disaster, We're Here Because We're Here). Weather Systems sees Anathema shifting even further from their original roots of doom/metal. Weather Systems can be described as pop music with atmospheric tendencies. It is one of their least experimental albums, with only one track being slightly experimental (the electronic-based and excellent \\"The Storm Before the Calm\\").<br /><br />Then why am I giving it 5 stars if it doesn't break new ground?<br /><br />Because it's just plain good. The lyrics are touching. Vincent Cavanagh's vocals have hit a career best. And Lee Douglas - the guest singer on Anathema's albums since Judgement - is now a full member, and she is on almost every track - steals the entire album with her godlike voice. Listen to \\"Lightning Song\\" if you don't believe me. She is definitely one of the best singers in the world.<br /><br />Weather Systems is my favorite album of 2012 so far. It's just so good. And that's coming from a 10-year Anathema fan.

B007X15GRQ|3.0|To echo the words of another reviewer, if you are a Wahlberg fan and enjoy the heist genre, this movie is passably viewable.  I might be a bit more critical if I had shelled out some serious coin and watched this in the theater, but as a rental I don't regret the $4.99.  Wahlberg is his usual frowny, muscley self, not much change here- but this is how I like my Wahlberg, full of quiet angst and muted emotions (sans rage of course).  Beckinsale's performance was pretty vanilla, enough so that I forgot that it was her until I came back to write this.<br /><br />In sum, it is worth a rental if you like this kind of genre.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app and is easy to use. The only thing that I can see that it would be best to improve on is energy management.

0345803507|1.0|The first book for me was like watching a train wreck. Bad but I could not stop. The second , for some reason I have yet to figure out, was a tad better and got me curious to see what was going to happen so I went ahead and read this third and final one.<br />OMG it was horrible. It was dull, uninspiring,  boring and terrible to say the least. I even skimmed the sex scenes because they are so repetitive I could not  make myself read through them.<br />Do yourself a favor and , even if you liked the first 2 books, do not go for this one.<br />Now with spoilers*********<br /><br />I have no problem with the sex in this book. No problem with them enjoying rough, S&M  or anything else. That is cool with me.<br /> I think, as a woman, that sex while pregnant is healthy and normal, but what the heck !!!!!<br />Flagging a woman's pregnant belly and swollen breasts from pregnancy ???? That was a huge turn off and pretty creepy!<br /><br />To say something positive I did think it was sweet that Grey liked breast milk. That was kind of cool.<br /><br />But this book was so poorly written and such a waste of my time.....oh well ..moving on .
B007V2UGPE|1.0|liked playing.  but glitches in menu wont let me select &quot;play game&quot; or however it is worded&quot;.  I can click on other options.  just not the one to play.

0618918248|5.0|Believers, non-believers, and those who just haven't made up their mind ought to all read this book.  You don't have to agree with Dawkins, but you should at least hear what he has to say.  I first read this book when it came out years ago.  I just finished \\"reading\\" it again by listening to it on audio in which Dawkins himself narrates most of the book (he also has a female narrator as well).  I think Dawkins comes off as less strident when you hear his voice.  You get the inflection of his voice which carries meaning that is missing in the printed word.  However, I do understand why some people are offended by his tone.  He says right up front he will not go out of his way to offend, but at the same time he will not avoid saying what he believes needs to be said.<br /><br />I consider most of this book to be very convincing, although I already believed what it has to say before I read it.  Most people aren't convinced to change their mind either direction by what they read and nobody should have any illusions that this book is going to convert the masses, because it won't.  I do however know somebody who was converted completely by reading this book.  I was quite surprised.<br /><br />Nobody anywhere ever should be afraid of thought.  It is on of the great beauties of the human mind that it is capable of such higher thought.  I consider it the great pleasure of my life to think about the big questions.  Richard Dawkins makes people think.  Everyone should be better off as a result whether you agree or not.  I find that I often admire people who challenge my thought whether I agree with their conclusions or not.  You can only be offended if you let someone have power over you that you should not let them have.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins in my opinion is quite brilliant as a scientist and as a thinker in general.  Give him a fair hearing and then I will respect you no matter what your opinion of his conclusions.<br /><br />This is simply an outstanding book.  Read it and make up your own mind.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Jace and the rest of the Lightwood's are planning to travel to Idris, the home of the Shadowhunters. After an attack that injures Simon, Jace pulls him through the portal to save his life. Unfortunately, as Simon is now a Downworlder, he is there illegally. Meanwhile, Clary and Luke find out where the Lightwood's have gone and Clary decides to go after them. Valentine has the Mortal Cup and The Sword, but he still needs the mirror to fulfil his plan to call the angel, Raziel. Will Clary and Jace be able to stop their father before it's too late?<br /><br />This is the third book in The Mortal Instruments series. I LOVED IT! It's not often that you come across a writer who can create a whole world of fictional characters that come to life, and keep the story's pace fast and furious over a whole series. Cassandra Clare is one such author. I love her writing style and I can easily imagine the city of Idris as it is described. There are more characters introduced. Sebastian is a Lightwood cousin (or is he?). Valentine has more page time, and is suitably dark and creepy. The secrets that are revealed are surprising and, at times, shocking. However, there are a lot of secrets still to be uncovered.<br />This is a fantastic story, and I highly recommend this YA series to young and old alike.

B0000017CA|5.0|acid bath is one of the heaviest bands on planet earth. i am not even joking around at all. i listen to bands like black sabbath, pantera, meshuggah, black flag, and high on fire. so for me to say what i did, you gotta know its true if u know metal. the guitars and the vocals are sick as hell. when he sings he sounds scarier and more dangerous then most frontman screaming or growling their brains out. the guitars are sooo damn thick low and heavy its impossible not to dig. this album isnt as good as their second one but still rips all the way through. alot of people havent even heard of acid bath. i didnt hear about them until a few years ago, and im soo glad i did. this is a heavy metal classic. it looks good in my collection and would in yours too. if u got some extra cash and are looking for new bands to check out, make this the first one. u wont regret it. long live heavy metal. the only genre that hasent ever went away. have a good day. peace

B004G600A4|5.0|Rapunzel has 70 feet of golden magical hair that has healing powers. Her guardian, Mother Gothel, stole her as a baby because she wanted to stay young and beautiful forever. The flower that did the same thing was taken from her and given to Rapunzel's mother as a remedy, passing the power on to her daughter. She tried to cut off Rapunzel's hair, but it loses its magical properties and becomes useless. Rapunzel is now a young adult and reasonably would like to see the floating lights that happen every year on her birthday. Mother Gothel refuses to let her go, even if it's for her birthday, and explodes in true evil stepmother fashion. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals a crown from the royal family, ditches his accomplices, and hides in Rapunzel's tower. She subdues him and plans to show her mother she can handle herself, but Mother Gothel explosion ensues before she can show anything. Instead, Rapunzel asks for paints that take 3 days to get so she can force Flynn to take her to see the floating lights. Her journey with Flynn Rider will take her places she has never been and change her life forever.<br /><br />The first time I saw Tangled, I was completely unimpressed. I thought the story was ok, but the songs just fell flat for me. I have no idea why I thought this, but upon a great many rewatchings, I grew to love everything about: the characters, the songs, and those small moments you only notice after watching it at least a dozen times. Something just clicked in me and I fell in love with the film. The characters are dynamic and wonderful. Rapunzel is incredibly naive because she's never been in the outside world, but she definitely isn't stupid. Her naivete and kindness actually helps them cross the land to the castle to see the lanterns of her dreams. Plus her hair gets them out of a lot of sticky situations. Flynn Rider is a cocky, egotistical, self serving jerk on the outside, but a sweetheart on the inside. I really liked that their relationship is built on friendship and getting to know each other as opposed to the typical fairy tale instalove. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, is just about the cutest thing ever and plays an instrumental role in the story. Maximus, the horse bent on capturing Flynn, is more like a dog than a horse, which was kind of weird, but still cute.<br /><br />The best part of the whole film is Mother Gothel and her relationship with Rapunzel. Their relationship is built on a heap of lies and Mother Gothel only wants Rapunzel for her hair. Mother Gothel only calls Rapunzel endearing names like Flower (for the original flower that kept her young) and constantly strokes her hair because it is valuable to her and the actual girl is not. She is pretty evil, but not in the black and white, easily discerned way like most Disney villains. She's more like an actual abusive mother. She laces veiled insults with compliments to Rapunzel and says she's just kidding after many of the hurtful things she says. She also never admits being wrong and never really apologizes for anything. This is to keep Rapunzel under control, but keep her marginally content so she won't run away. It's heartbreaking to watch because Rapunzel lived with this her whole life and internalized many of Mother Gothel's insults. The damage of this is most apparent in the scene when she first leaves the tower, alternating between celebrating loudly and crying over betraying her mother. Mother Gothel manipulates everyone around her and will do anything to get what she wants.<br /><br />The music really grew on me over time and I've fallen in love with all of the songs. When Will My Life Begin is a fun song describing the many many things Rapunzel does in a day while she feels like she's really doing nothing in the bigger picture. The song is upbeat and fun, but with longing behind the happiness, just like Rapunzel. My other favorite song is I See the Light. It depicts the moments when Flynn and Rapunzel's relationship moves to more than friendship and feature the most beautiful moment in the film when the lanterns are released above them. The harmonies are beautiful and their feelings are completely believable.<br /><br />Tangled is a complex film that appeals to children as well as adults. It's the best Disney movie since the 90's in my opinion. It's a little darker and more believable than the usual Disney fare because there are people in the world just like Mother Gothel. She manipulates everyone around her to get what she wants and psychologically and verbally abuses Rapunzel to keep her complacent. I think this is a wonderful retelling of Rapunzel and I would recommend to any fan of fairy tales. I would also recommend a viewing of the short Tangled Ever After because it's hilarious and adorable!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This booking held my attention right from the start!  I had a hard time putting it down and wanted to keep reading!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|similar to other side scrolling games that allow you to level up. good game for passing time. cant figure out how to turn off the sound though.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I really enjoyed this game but a few hours after I downloaded it,  it stopped working and I had to uninstall and reinstall it. I am playing it now so we will see if this fixes it.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is an excellent film. It's a daring film too. Like another film, The Usual Suspects, it starts in the present with a scene between an old man and a young one. The old man asks him what he wants and the young man struggles to recall what he wants from the old man. It leads to the start of the story in the past and an extraction job on the train to Kyoto, Saito's offer to Cobb, the assembly of the team, putting together their game plan for putting an idea into a financial rival's mind, the dream shared aboard the jet, onto the opening scene again when the young man why he's here then onto the final scene. The plot is superb. One man, Cobb, wants to find his way home to his family while another one, Saito, is willing to pay a fortune to change the outcome of events with a rival business firm through the inception of an idea into his rival's mind. The cast is also superb. It took more than Leonard DiCaprio to pull this story off. In this case there was some strong writing. Something closer to six or seven characters were needed for the development of the plot. Is it too complicated or just too intriguing? I really enjoy watching a good film again and again and have truly enjoyed Inception. Dreaming by itself was no basis for a story but to the credit of Inception it introduced dream-sharing by way of a new technology. In view of the developments over the past 60 years viewers will find it quite easy enough to suspend their disbelief. Cobb and his wife, Mal, put the learning to use by way of extracting ideas by people. Once they began building dreams within dreams extraction was easier but time moves at a different and slower pace at various levels of a dream. It can also become difficult to distinguish a dream from reality and they finally lose their way into the sub-conscious. After fifty years down there Cobb tries inception on Mal and plants an idea in her mind which leads to their return but Mal suspects that she's still dreaming and wants Cobb to return to reality. One night she tries to blackmail Cobb by informing the police that she suspects her husband will kill her. Dreams can be usually brought to an end when the dreamer runs out of time on the machine or is killed. After she kills herself Cobb leaves the country to avoid arrest but he's still deeply filled with regret and guilt about Mal who is constantly trying to keep him with her. It's interesting how one storyline is affecting the other one and the characterization which results from it.<br /><br />Ken Watanabe plays Mr. Saito. He's heard about extraction and rumours about conception. He's convinced that he will be financially ruined by his rival, Mr. Fischer. Now he's heard rumors about Cobb's skill but before he asks Cobb he wants to make sure that he's talking to the right mind. So he arranges an audition for Cobb's crew under tough conditions with himself as the target. Cobb extracts the information but he realizes that Saito has known all along about the job from start and asks why? Saito was never interested in the extraction but the level of Cobb's skill. While Cobb extracted the information, Saito wasn't impressed with the level of skill that Cobb showed. His opinion of Cobb quickly rises when he realizes that he's still dreaming. Cobb placed him in a dream inside a dream. In the following scene Saito makes an offer to Cobb of financial reward and a safe return to America if he can succeed in planting an idea in his rival's mind. Money is no problem with Saito. So Cobb finds a top-notch crew who will work for him and his partner, Arthur. DiCaprio clearly dominates the first crew but when Saito tells him to put together a better team he becomes part of the team. Michael Caine puts in a strong appareanance as Cobb's father-in-law who finds him another architect in dream-sharing, Ariadne played by Ellen Page. Then it's onto Africa for an interview with an old friend, Eames played by Tom Hardy, who's a skillful thief and forger and introduces Cobb to Yusuf,the Chemist played by Dileep Rao. Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy, puts in another good performance as Saito's rival. What's really interesting are all the contributions everybody makes towards the development of the story. It is a well written story and well performed one. You'll also appreciate the quick pace.<br /><br />While the dream starts on the jet. The levels of the dream can always be identified. The first level of the dream can always be identified by the rain in a city downtown. The primary development is the appearance of projections from Fischer's mind into dream who will defend him against any attempt at extraction. On this level Saito is shot and dying but on the lower levels it will take longer for him to die. Eames attempts to kill him and end the dream but the sedative taken demands their return to consciousness in a particular fashion. If they die they are lost in a sub-consciousness of the dreamer. So they must go onto the next level of the dream inside a van that Yusuf is driving. The second level of the dream is found in an expensive hotel where Cobb plays a figure on this level known as Mr. Charles and poses as one of the projections sent to guard Fischer. Mr. Charles gains Fischer's trust and convinces him that a corporate figure in his father's company is betraying him and the only way to learn the truth is entering a third level of the dream. The third level takes place in winter and the mountains where Fischer fights to learn the truth and the team plants an idea in him.In the meantime Saito dies during the assault. The scenes in the sub-conscicous take place in beautiful weather on the seaside. The final beach scene leads you to an earlier scene from the start of the film: an old man asks Cobb what he wants. The old man is Saito who was killed and has been lost for years. Cobb now remembers the audition for Saito, the inception and his confrontation with Mal. He urges Saito, now an old man filled with his regrets and guilt to come back with him and be young again. Well, the next scene tells you what happen he finds himself waking aboard the jet with Fischer, Saito and his crew. Saito places a call to set things in motion which will clear the way for Cobb's return home.<br /><br />I've seen this film on numerous occasions over the past few years. It just keeps getting better. It only proves the importance of good writing and acting to one another as well as editing and directing. Suspense simply is not a factor. Yet the story constantly grips you. You simply don't realize the length of the film by its quick pace of the story.the Chemist played by Dileep Rao.

B00129H7VS|4.0|It's totally a shame that many camera sequences are bouncy and totally exaggerated from a real human eye perspective which was done in Saving Private Ryan and numerous newer movie productions.  I can't be the only one that this bothers and makes me get VERTIGO!  Also it's a slap in the face of Garrett Brown who almost went bankrupt perfecting his Steadicam.  Band of Brothers would of been Totally Excellent and a real tribute to Wild Bill Guarnere and Easy Company
B006LMMN8I|5.0|BUY THIS, BUY THIS AND BUY THIS AGAIN. It's been a while since i put something on and felt so good listening to it. It's BB (Blue collar Butter..ha ha)and i hope that this doesn't offend.  Listening to Mr. Porter is such a bare foot walk through grass and leaves, and trees and city streets while the sun, clouds and breeze play a pulse un-agitated and reflective. His tone just feels like honesty, like a rocking chair holding a story teller, lover, brother and friend telling us about being together, being a friends, surviving the things that try to break us apart.<br />God this album realllly made me feel hope and compassion. His voice is just smooth, and mature. Just like i knew Prince would carry the baton after James brown, Gregory's voice really gives us another Bill Withers Butter-but i say that as a compiment with the understanding that Gregory Porter IS HIS OWN MAN COMPLETELY, it's just that him and Bill Withers GOT THAT BUTTER VOICE! BUTTER. This is an album where the musicians, the tones, the expressions are simple and complicated only because the  messages are so common through the ages-and this man really brings it into focus. RIGHT ON TO ALL THAT MADE THIS ALBUM POSSIBLE. THANK YOU GREGORY FOR REMINDING MY HEART THAT BEAUTY IS NEVER FAR AWAY!!
0439023521|5.0|When I first heard about The Hunger Games I was dead set against reading it. It didn't sound like anything I would be even a little bit interested in.  Then one day, I was at the local library and the librarian there talked me into giving it a try. I am so very glad she did. I devoured the book in 4 hours without moving once from my couch. I was drawn in from the first page and I literally could not put the book down.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, our narrator,  is such a strong and complex character.  She may not be the easiest girl to get to know, but it's very easy to admire and get behind her as you read. I think you have to look closer to see the real Katniss. She has no idea how to respond to kindness or show her true feelings (or sometimes even know her true feelings) without putting on a brave face and doing what she thinks she has to in order to survive.<br /><br />There were a few twists I definitely didn't see coming when I read this book and it is a very fast read. You simply must know what will happen next. This was my first dystopian novel and it really opened up my mind to a whole new genre. I could honestly discuss this book forever but I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't had the chance to read it yet. By the way, if you haven't read it yet-get going to get yourself a copy and you'll see what all the fuss is about. I promise.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Loved it!  Great read.  Only read the first book because of all of the hype but loved it so much I had to read the other two straight away!  Thank goodness for Amazon and Kindle for iPad :)
B0028ER4QE|5.0|I got to hand it to The Doors and Elektra Records as they put out an excellent quality version of the original debut album from the band. First off, you get a nice 180g cut thick vinyl. Second, they also include a nice quality inner plastic sleeve to store the record. Third, in comes shipped with a loose outer plastic sleeve to keep you LP free from wear. All you have to do is find a simple tear on the preforated edge and your set! Also, I don't have a super expensive turntable, and to say this record sounded awesome would be an understatement. There were no skips nor any surface noise on the silent grooves, unbelievable. Highly recommended for anyone who is a Doors fan collecting and listening to vinyl.
0307592731|3.0|This is not the first \\"long hiking as catharsis\\" book, nor is it the first to chronicle the struggles of a totally green hiker. However, it may be the first hiking book to deal with so much baggage, some physical, to be sure, but mostly psychological. Lots and lots of baggage, and it continually gets in the way of the hike as the author meanders (and maunders) way off the trail, in time and place, to deal with her various compulsions and unresolved personal weaknesses. Toward the end of the book, I just didn't care to go there with her anymore. Some may argue that the focus of the story was the personal journey, and that may well be true, but there are better books out there that deal with that subject, as well as the PCT.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|there is not much resolved in this book although there are some definite ends to some of the characters. mostly we read about Cersei and her point of view, jealousy of King Tommen's bride and her schemes to thwart her. i liked the first three books, but this one was tedious and boring. There is nothing mentioned about my favorite character so far, Daenaerys:(

This book may not hold a candle to other Booker prize winners, such as Midnight's Children, but hey - what does?  In the end, a solid, thoroughly good book.  Worth the time.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This movie works on all levels for me:  script, acting, editing, tension.  I was especially impressed by the performance of Melusine, who creates a completely believable character, while acting with poise and nuance that I wouldn't have thought possible at her age.  I felt all through the movie that the filmmakers were treating their characters and their subject matter with dignity and compassion--this was an aspect of WWII with which I had been only passingly familiar, and I'm glad that I learned about it this way.  I'm very glad that French filmmakers made this--Hollywood would have tried to wrap it all up in a neat little package with a \\"satisfying\\" ending that resolved all of the conflicts of all of the characters, and they wouldn't have allowed so much to go unsaid that truly needs to go unsaid.  We don't need to know why someone doesn't want to talk of why the main character flies to New York--there are enough clues in the movie so that we can figure it out ourselves; besides, often people in real life do things we don't expect or things that surprise us.<br /><br />This was a very emotional journey that doesn't manipulate our emotions, and a tense drama that kept me riveted the entire time.  Likeable characters who do the best they can during difficult times and a difficult subject make for one of the better films that I've seen in a while.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I have played a number of Mahjong games and this has to be one of most original and enjoyable to date.  It is like a good book--you just cannot put it down.  It is just difficult enough to be a challenge without frustrating you to quit.  I hope this is just the beginning of more exciting mahjong games to pass the time while still keeping my mind busy.  I purchased this game through Amazon.  Keep it up Amazon -- you are doing great!!!
B0071QIN00|5.0|you should buy the game it is amazing<br />but my mom did not let me get it I used the demo
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I have GPS/radar chart plotters on my boat that cost about $5000 new a few years ago. A few weeks ago I downloaded the free trial version of PolarView from [...]. I was so impressed with it's intuitive course planning and free NOAA vector and raster chart and GRIB downloads that I bought the license for PolarView/PolarCom for about $42. This program has the capability for GPS tracking. So I bought the BU-535 for about $25 thinking \\"you get what you pay for\\" but little ventured, etc. Well after some fiddling (my fault for not completely reading the directions) and help from PolarView's excellent support system, the little $25 BU-535 and GPS/PolarView/PolarCom system works like a champ on my MacBook Air and is very accurate. I highly recommend this product.
0439023483|1.0|Very disheartening to think young  adults find this book so appealing.  I would not allow my kids to read this book.  Cruel.  To think humankind would come to this is sad.  Maybe we have became so dis sensitized we are numb.
B007P3TMW2|1.0|Long and boring pretty much sums it up. It was a rip off exploiting big star names and a national tragedy to entice viewers into watching a movie that was LONG AND BORING. Do Sandra and Tom need money that much?

0006486118|1.0|Loved the first 3 books, tolerated the first half of the 4th (AFfC), absolutely wanted to wipe my nether regions with the latest installment. Shame on the gurm for lying to us back in 2005, telling us that it was alreday done but too large for a single volume. Then churning out some of the worst print I have ever read.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing, gurm.

B0062KJ198|3.0|How much you like or dislike this movie is, obviously up to YOU.  If you are looking for an Academy Award worthy movie, you won't get it here. However, if you are looking for and hour and a half of fun, fast-paced escape from reality in a movie that has a few plot twists and a medium amount of humor mixed with drama, then I'd seriously consider watching this IF the price is right.<br /><br />I paid $9.99 to view it.  I over-paid.  It's good, but not $10 worth of good!<br /><br />Don't look for this movie to tie up loose ends since it's SO unrealistic.  So people who like to analyze movies and get messages from them will be disappointed. I won't go into details since they may be spoilers for some.<br /><br />The bottom line is what I wrote in the first paragraph. For pure fun, laughs, and some fast-moving, twisting drama, this comes through.  But I doubt it will be a movie you give much thought to 30 minutes after viewing it.<br /><br />*NOTE:  STRONG LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT; NUDITY; QUITE A FEW SEXUAL REFERENCES  (These don't bother me at all.  However, this information should be included in any review of this movie.)

What is fiction?<br /><br />Scott Anderson is the Environmental Defense Fund's point man on gas exploration.  \\"If we're talking about whether or not the fractures that have been created by `frack' jobs have been known to intersect drinking water aquifers, the fact is there have been no confirmed cases of that happening.\\"<br /><br />In states like Pennsylvania, the gas rich Marcellus shale lies about 6,000 feet deep. That's where the hydraulic fracturing takes place. The deepest aquifers run to about 1,000 feet below ground. That's 5,000 feet of separation, much of it impermeable rock.<br /><br />Ray Walker is the COO of Range Resources.

B001U7FWMI|5.0|That might seem an overly ambitious assessment.  But consider this - all an album would have to do to make that list would be to be one of the top ten albums of the decade.<br /><br />I might even say it was the number one album of the decade (in this humble reviewer's opinion).  The emotional depth and dynamics are hard to find a recent parallel.  They are propelled by artistic choices that draw from the best movements of the 60's, 70's 80's and 90's.  Low-fi. Punk.  Progressivism.  Ambience.  Emotional urgency.  Playfulness.  Layered harmonies and textured instrumentation.<br /><br />It is that rare record that capably brings in familiar themes and aesthetics, yet in new and transcendent ways that create something profound.<br /><br />I could see myself looking back on this album, from my deathbed - 2058? - and seeing it beside a handful of records that remain on my weathered, post-petroleum top shelf.

The author seemed more bent on making sure he showed Steve Jobs in a negative light than he did on the genius things Steve accomplished in his life.  Kind of like \\"Gottcha\\".  The author spent days of Steve's precious time to write this book and he didn't even have the common courtesy to thank or acknowledge Steve or his family for that precious time and opportunity.  Shame on you Walter Isaacson.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|This movie, along with Vicki Christina Barcelona, rank at the top of Allen's recent movies.  The cinemaphotography, the soundtrack...just awesome!  He has captured the culture and magic of what makes those 2 countries so very special, exactly as they are, with those 2 elements alone.  I will watch 'Midnight in Paris' again and again when the 'mood' arises.  The acting, superb as well.  Enough said, other reviewers said it all.  I am only adding the 5 star rating.  I have been to both countries on several occasions and after watching both of these films, I hunger for my next trip to either Spain or France...
6304711905|2.0|Ok, I've just finished this movie for the second time and I can honestly say there will NOT be a third. I watched Wyatt Earp and Tombstone back to back today and I'm one of the few who feel Wyatt Earp is by far superior in almost every way. The only thing Tombstone has going for it that Wyatt Earp doesn't is length. I feel Wyatt Earp is just too long. But still watchable and enjoyable none the less.<br /><br />I've watched Wyatt Earp several times(and loved it each time) and got through Tombstone twice. Teeth grinding both times. Now I'm no history buff what so ever, but what I do know about the real life Wyatt Earp, I feel Costner portrayed much better! Russell just came off as kind of a coward right up until Morgan was killed. And speaking of Morgan... Bill Paxton was horrible as Morgan as was Sam Elliott as Virgil. Michael Madsen and Linden Ashby were much better and believable as Virgil and Morgan!<br /><br />My biggest complaints about this film are it felt entirely way too Hollywood as soon as it started instead of it feeling like a western. And my god, Powers Booth absolutely over did it! He came off as a cartoon or comic book villain. And a bad one at that! The entire film felt rushed. There was no character development, the scenery felt like a cheap set, and majority of the actors just didn't fit. It's an exact opposite of Wyatt Earp. Not only do I enjoy watching Wyatt Earp, but it's one of my favorite movies. Tombstone falls under one of my most hated movies.<br /><br />I can't point out the bad without pointing out the good. Kilmers Doc Holiday was pretty damn good! In fact, his performance and Michael Biehn's Johnny Ringo are the only enjoyable parts of this movie. Not only were they convincing, but they seemed to have fun and enjoyed their roles. BUT, as good as Kilmers performance was, it doesn't hold a candle to Quaids. Watching Tombstone, I saw Kilmer play Doc Holiday whereas in Wyatt Earp, I saw a Doc Holiday that looked like a shrunken Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />All in all, Wyatt Earp is by far, 100 times better. Maybe I feel this way because I saw Wyatt Earp before watching Tombstone or maybe it's just because of how bad Tombstone really is. The only reason this gets two stars is cause of Doc Holiday and Johnny Ringo. Everything I hated about this movie(again, scenery, acting, character development, gun fights and everything else) is done much better in Wyatt Earp. Do yourself a favor and check out Wyatt Earp regardless if you're a Costner fan or not. It's much better in every way.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|FallenTree Games has produced an excellent sequel. Whereas the first has you solve tricky puzzles and mazes with just one drop, Quell Reflect ups it to 2, 3, and 4, adds some more elements, and the result is a superior game.
B005HEUKNQ|4.0|This is an interesting-ish episode concerning Troi, with a side note of a new chief medical officer, Dr. Katherine Pulaski.<br /><br />Peraonally, I had to suspend belief a bit further than usual for the Troi story...or perhaps it just wasn't interesting to me. Overall I feel \\"meh\\" about it.<br /><br />I'd relly love to get your feedback on Pulaski, though. I suppose this question would be better asked at the end of the season, but I'm guessing most of you are not first time viewers.<br />I enjoy Dr. Pulaski for two reasons. Primarily, she reminds me of McCoy in many ways. She's old fashioned, opinionated, and argumentative with her captain. Even her speech patterns remind me of McCoy, whom I adored.<br />Secondarily, I a was never a big fan of Dr. Crusher. I certainly don't dislike either the character or Gates McFadden. Just not wild about her.<br /><br />Hoping you'll weigh in ~ellie

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved the book. I thought I knew Steve's story reasonably well, but the book had quite a few surprises for me.<br />The great thing about the book, author didn't take sides; there is enough dirt on Steve in it - people of that calibre are often polarising and Steve was no exception.<br />If you're even remotely related to IT, read this book.<br />If you're even remotely related to business, read this book.<br />Hell, even if you just want to read a book about an interesting person, read this book, you'll learn something.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Hi, I started doing a review but I got a call.  This movie is excellent to see Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullocks in this #1 movie, or my idea of what I will rate it.  It is so good, that I had to loan it to a friend and she found it be really good too. When I saw it was coming out in the movie theatres with my health I knew I couldn't go to see it. So I just waited for it to come out.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I can say I was a little nervous about viewing this movie at first as my boyfriend is in the Army and I didn't know what kind of effect it would have on me. I gathered my emotions and away I went to the theater. I sat in excited anticipation for the movie to start despite my fear of being \\"emotional\\" before the movies end. The movie started a little slow and seemed to jump around a little.<br /><br /> After very few minutes though, it started coming together and sucked me in like a massive vortex!!!! Some people complain about the Seals not being actors....... Had I of not known ahead of time they were not actors, I would never have guessed it. In the heat of battle, they were so realistic I was drawn into the battles with them.... you can almost feel the adrenaline!!!!<br /><br /> Very action packed, moving, and exciting movie!!!! It does have some really rough language in it, intense action and of course war violence so I would not reccomend it for a young audience or some one easily offended by foul language and blood. However, if you can get past the language, this a MUST SEE move!!!!<br /><br /> By the time the credit screen was up, I had to make myself breath!!!! As I left the theater my heart was pounding and I had to make myself quit breathing so hard..... I was so hyped up!!!! This is ONE AWESOME MOVIE!!! A great tribute to our Special Forces......... I think it would be good for every American to watch this movie!!!!!<br /><br /> I Highly reccomend this movie!!!!
0345803493|2.0|I bought this book as a gift, I own the first one but have not sat down to read it yet. My review is NOT based on the quality of this story, because I don't know what the story is yet. HOWEVER, I am FURIOUS to discover that this entire trilogy is posted all over the internet FOR FREE! It was originally Twilight fan-fiction and then copy and pasted into a book. I am not against reading fan-fiction, nor am I against paying for a story in print if I like it on-line. I am upset that there is NO DISCLAIMER that tells readers \\"This book is posted for free all over the internet, so you don't need to spend $10+ on it\\"<br /><br />I am VERY disappointed, as are several people I know. If anyone would care to test drive this \\"book\\" before you buy it, google search for \\"Master of the Universe\\" and download the pdf file.

B002DEPJB6|4.0|Laugh out loud funny in many places. The wise cracking Laura Lai (or however you spell her name) is hilarious in places. The witty bantering between her and Rory (if that is how you spell her name) is refreshing TV. BUT in between these high points you get a true glimpse of spoiled, self-involved, bratty Americans. Their wise cracks turn into cynicism after they make fun of anything nice and good. The entire \\"I was abused because I was born into a wealthy privileged family with parents who wanted something for me\\" bit got old and actually never got off the ground. It was more like \\"I was abused by my bad decisions born out of total selfish behavior\\" bit. I would have loved to have had had a foot in the door of LauraLai's parents' world.  . . . her parents as a great aunt and uncle or something. The show pulls you in to the love stories only to let you down as the \\"heroines\\" turn on their lovers and of course blame their wealthy backgrounds. They toss aside good guys who treat them well just because. They rattle off these lines of just words as fast as they can, usually yelling, gets old and annoying after a while. It is supposed to be intelligent banter somehow, we are led to believe. It was really a disappointment to watch these train wrecks in motion. But I must say . . . it is reality for some people. How many times have you known someone who just dug their own grave out of total immaturity and you just had to sit around watching them to because they refused to listen to any advice. They had everything and just thumbed their nose at it claiming to have the high moral ground. I just think I wouldn't like most of these people in real life as the ones similar to them I know in real life . . . I distance myself from. Funny irony is no matter how much LaurLai makes fun of her parents and her upbringing and no matter how many teary emotional outburts we witness between her and her parents over how \\"abused\\" she was she runs right back to them for help when the going gets rough. I have known a couple of people like that too--they have the luxury of being smarties and mocking the rich as they are rich themselves.
B0073U2F2Q|2.0|\\"The Darkest Hour\\" has potential. The premise is pretty darn interesting (although it's borrowed from other science fiction novels that have been around for at least twenty plus years)--what if an alien invasion occurs by creatures that we just can't see and appear to be electrical in nature? How do we fight something like that much less survive?<br /><br />When a website designer Ben(Anthony Mingella) and his best friend Sean(Emile Hirsch)travel to Moscow to pitch their new design to a company they are greeted with disappointed--the head of the company Skyler (Joel Kinnaman)has ripped off the design and has no plans on paying them (his advice--\\"next time include a PDA\\"). The angry and disappointed duo end up clubbing where they meet Natalie (Olivia Tirlby)and Anne (Rachal Taylor). The attack occurs while the four and Skyler are at the club. Everyone who comes into contact with the aliens are vaporized and the quintet are on the run for their survival.<br /><br />There's all the best elements for a thriller here but the writers (including Jon Spaihts who worked on an early version of \\"Prometheus\\")and director Chris Gorak (who directed a fascinating Indie thriller [[ASIN:B000YIGNCW Right at Your Door]]where he does everything right that he gets wrong in this movie)do very little to develop the characters or the premise beyond your standard invasion movie. In fact \\"The Darkest Hour\\" borrows liberally from other recent invasion flicks (including Spielberg's version of War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)).<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of this looks extremely good. Shot on digital video it almost looks as good as film in terms of its presentation here.<br /><br />The 5.2 lossless soundtrack sounds terrific with strong presence but still maintaining clear dialogue.<br /><br />The special features are actually in some ways better than the feature film itself. \\"Survivors\\" a short film based in the same \\"world\\" manages to be a stronger examination of the same themes.<br /><br />\\"Visualizing the Invasion\\" gives us the behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts of creating the interesting visual effects used throughout the film.<br /><br />We also get deleted and extended scenes with commentary that gives us a bit of context as to why they were not used.<br /><br />Finally we get a feature length commentary track by the director focusing on everything the challenges of shooting for a 3D exhibition (knowing eventually it will be shown without the 3D effects as well), shooting on location in Moscow and the various changes that were made to the script prior to shooting.<br /><br />It's a pity that the director and writers didn't take a more unusual approach to the material as the premise itself it fascinating but it is developed into a VERY conventional invasion thriller with few surprises in the film.<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour\\" might be worth a rental (which is what I did)but I really couldn't recommend purchasing it unless you temper your expectations and get it for a decent price./><br />\\"Visualizing the Invasion\\" gives us the behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts of creating the interesting visual effects used throughout the film.<br /><br />We also get deleted and extended scenes with commentary that gives us a bit of context as to why they were not used.<br /><br />Finally we get a feature length commentary track by the director focusing on everything the challenges of shooting for a 3D exhibition (knowing eventually it will be shown without the 3D effects as well), shooting on location in Moscow and the various changes that were made to the script prior to shooting.<br /><br />It's a pity that the director and writers didn't take a more unusual approach to the material as the premise itself it fascinating but it is developed into a VERY conventional invasion thriller with few surprises in the film.<br /><br />\\"The Darkest Hour\\" might be worth a rental (which is what I did)but I really couldn't recommend purchasing it unless you temper your expectations and get it for a decent price.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|To get the most out of Henry Kissinger's &#34;On China&#34; one should read Jonathan Spence's The Search for Modern China in order to understand the Chinese culture, frame of reference, and history that lead up to modern China.  What Kissinger provides absolutely brilliantly was his personal experience and witness of China's modern foreign policy and market based economy unfold.  Kissinger does provide a condensed historical and cultural summary to &#34;catch up&#34; to post WWII China, but he assumes the reader knows something of China's history and culture so as not to dwell on it for more than 2 chapters.  The key figure was not so much Mao Zedong, the fascinating self appointed, delusional philosopher-ruler, but Deng Xiaoping who is the Chinese leader most responsible for China's emergence into a modern, superpower, both economically and geopolitically.  Under Deng, China was our secret partner in our &#34;Grand Strategy&#34; (first developed in 1947 by the great State Department thinker and planner, George F. Kennan) to contain the USSR, under the Marshall Plan.  Deng redefined the Chinese economy, where competence and decentralization accompanied by accountability, replaced failed central planning with which (ironically) our current administration seems to be toying without realizing that even China's senior leaders know pragmatically that it doesn't work.  On the geopolitical front, I learned from Kissinger's book that Deng secretly informed the US before it invaded Northern Vietnam to stop them from consolidating Laos and Cambodia into the traditional Indochinese configuration, but under a North Vietnamese hegemony as a USSR military and economic satellite.  Deng made a massive military assault on Vietnam's northern boarder, but then stopped after it took and held 12 miles deep along its boarder with Vietnam, which roughly corresponded to China's traditional Southern boarder under the &#34;Central Kingdoms&#34;.  This forced Vietnam to set up an opposing force to monitor the Chinese build up on its Northern flank, instead of invading Laos and Cambodia.  In fact, the USSR canceled, out of frustrated resignation, it's military aid to North Vietnam, and Vietnam withdrew from Laos and Cambodia.  What is significant is that Deng sought and obtained the tacit approval of the United States in advance that was kept secret for decades.  Kissinger's book is full of examples like this.  Even the confrontation over Taiwan and the straits separating Taiwan and China was mostly for show to order to keep the 7th Fleet pinned to that region and have the effect of offsetting Soviet influence.  It was astonishing, but geopolitically understandable, that when China took artillery pot shots at some of Taiwan's minor islands, it did so at predictable times, so that no one would get hurt, but the US would be sufficiently alarmed to keep up its military presence there.  In a way, China taught us the complex geopolitical game of &#34;Go&#34;, a Chinese board game of encirclement&#34; that when well played, is far more complex than Russian chess and reflects China's long obsession with Sun Tzu &#34;Art of War&#34;.  If we had had the relationship with China that Kissinger began during the Nixon Administration before and during the Korean War, it would have been either averted or shortened by 2 years.  In fact, China would not have given North Vietnam permission to invade South Korea.  Our reaction through the so-called &#34;Truman Doctrine&#34; was totally unforeseen.  Had we made it &#34;foreseeable&#34; like the anticipatory moves of the game of &#34;Go&#34;, there would have been perhaps a lot of saber rattling, but North Korean would not have attempted this adventure.  It should be noted that China so misunderstood the US's intentions, that it was preparing to invade Taiwan simultaneously, which was stopped in its tracks by Truman's deployment of the 7th fleet in the Sea of China.  It should be noted that China was the reluctant and suspicious ally of Stalin's USSR, only to learn how duplicitous and self serving Stain was and how honorable and reliable the US was by comparison.  All these amazing insights are thanks to Kissinger's remarkable book that I shall always treasure in our library.  What Kissinger only hints at by quoting cryptic comments from Deng and his successors, which I know from talking to senior Chinese leaders, is that the decline of the US is not in the interest of China because it would be destabilizing to world (military and economic) peace, and China, like Singapore and many SE Asian nations deplore it.  As long ad the US deploys its own blood and treasure, China is only too happy to see the US  as an ad hoc, itinerant intentional police force, as long as the US retreats or stops in its tracks, as the Chinese did on Vietnam's Northern boarder.  It is important to note that Kissinger is a witness, and refrains from gratuitous opinion, but the lessons of history are clear. Alain Palmieri, 4/28/2012, NY and NH.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Whilst I sometimes like to read pornography, this book is  badly written, badly edited and not exciting.  It is repetetive and a total waste of both time and money.  E.L.James would like us to believe that a well educated girl in the 21st century would put herself in such a situation, she would not.  If it were not for the pseudo tittilation it would be just a bad novel, as it stands, it is a bad, non titillating, non exciting and stupid book.  I would love to get my money back, and better still the time I wasted on it. I would never buy another book by this author.<br />Jeanette Amid

This is a great performance performed by a marvelous orchestra and six very beautiful and very talented ladies!!!!! Their voices are simply angelic!! It was rather disappointing that \\"You Raise Me Up\\" was not on the CD as it is on the DVD. I would recommend this group to any one who likes beautiful music performed professionaly with great passion and feeling!! The blonde lady that plays violin is definitly a great asset to the group with her violin artistry and her enthusiastic, energetic dancing. G. Watson
1577314808|5.0|How fabulous to finally find a book that gathers so much wisdom all in one place. Tolle's treatment of the dynamics of what he refers to as the pain body is absolutely some of the most powerful wisdom a human being can learn. If we can learn to be the observers in their own life stories, the resonance on this planet would improve exponentially.<br /><br />Highly recommend reading and re-reading later. As you apply the principles, you can go back and almost get to read a new book again.

0345803485|5.0|Such a guilty pleasure!  I'm slightly embarrassed to admit how much I have enjoyed these books (have read books 1 and 2 so far).  They are certainly not classic literature, but a delightful, smutty escape.  I couldn't put either book down & am waiting to read the 3rd book because I don't want it to be over!  There is something slightly reminiscent of the Twilight saga about these books.  An imperfect, relatable protagonist somehow making an unattainable, complicated hottie fall in love with her.  A wonderful formula that that satisfies a female fantasy.  It's also a delicious update on the old historical romance novels (ie-bodice-ripping pirates), in that it is super-dirty throughout.  No need to get overly concerned with plot when there is this much action. I secretly loved it!! I'm an educated woman (lawyer), and for some reason, this type of story about a character with a more submissive role in the bedroom is a like breath of fresh air.  Kind of troubling, but so true.  In any event, my husband loved that I was reading this book, as it spiced things up at our house!!  Highly recommend, just for fun.

Perhaps because there is an actual story line or because there is some inclusion of real (not to say strictly accurate) history of the Roman Empire, it is one of few modern movies that is a 'go to' when broadcast on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

B002ZG98C8|3.0|Based on a character in a fake trailer in \\"Grindhouse,\\" \\"Machete\\" is essentially one short movie expanded into a feature-length action. Danny Trejo plays a former Mexican Federale hired to assassinate a US senator played by Robert De Niro. Machete is a man of few words, deadly with weapons, and he is also a lady's man. This is the prolific actor's first leading role, and though the film is flawed, Danny Trejo is perfect as the vigilante hero.<br /><br />Part homage to exploitation movies, \\"Machete\\" is one-joke sketch turned into a 105 minute film. While the thin storyline is the film's obvious weakness, its strength lies in the cast including Jessica Alba, Jeff Fahey, Don Johnson, Lindsay Lohan, Cheech Marin, Michelle Rodriguez and Steven Seagal. With a cast of mostly B-list actors (and former A-listers), violent and sexy \\"Machete\\" certainly makes it point in its ultra-gory pre-credit 15 minutes, which is the best (or to some, worst) part of the film.<br /><br />But like most Robert Rodriguez films \\"Machete\\" tends to be slack and even dull when it forgets what it sets out to do. We know this is entertainment and we shouldn't take the film seriously, but some actors seem not to see things that way. The subplots about \\"Shé\\" and Alba's agent (with her not-so-convincing speech) only slow down the film. The confusing climax with so many characters shooting each other is a letdown. The filmmakers need better action choreography.<br /><br />\\"Machete\\" belongs to perfectly cast Danny Trejo. I hope he will come back in \\"Machete Kills\\" and \\"Machete Kills Again,\\" but please, next time with a better script.
0071373586|5.0|This is an outstanding book of high value to anyone trying to stand out from the crowd. The theme is that we are all marketers trying to communicate our message in the most effective manner and that there is a better way.<br /><br />The authors coined the term \\"positioning\\" and first wrote about it in a 1972 article in Advertising Age. \\"Positioning is the first body of thought that comes to grips with the problem of getting heard in an overcommunicated society,\\" they say. It is perhaps even more relevant today given the orders-of-magnitude increase in messaging of all types where only the tiniest fraction is relevant to any one person.<br /><br />Developed largely around big-company advertising, positioning is broadly applicable to entrepreneurs, small business, job seekers, career professionals and lonely people as well as corporations and institutions. How can this be? Don't we live in a society of rapid obsolescence where yesterday's news is virtually irrelevant? The reason is psychology.<br /><br />Positioning is based on how people think, how they evaluate, how they compare, how they prioritize and how they select.

B0043WHUGS|5.0|I wasn't really sure what this movie was going to be like -- the person who recommended and lent it to me just said, \\"You'll like it, it has a lot of Beatles songs in it.\\"  Which it does.  It's a rather clever musical that weaves Beatles numbers into a love story between Jude and Lucy (from \\"Hey, Jude\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" -- and yes, those songs are in there) taking place during the anti-war movement of the 1960s.  But it is more than that. The photography, choreography, and animations are, in my opinion, on the level of art. As an oldster who remembers that era, I found it to be both a trip down memory lane and a movie that is still relevant and beautiful today.

B007UXSDYU|1.0|This film shows the dark side of human behavior without restraint and humanity. For mere voyeurism and violence sake, I see no entertainment value or enjoyment watching women getting raped and men displaying the \\"might is right\\" justification at any costs. How long does capitivity take for some to butcher and mutilate corpses before justifying cannibalism? How long does being confined with a group of strangers make humans more dangerous to each other before we realize maybe surviving was a bad idea? In any case, I found myself wanting these people to die if these people are whats left of the human race. It was a waste of time watching and money renting this film.

B00003CXXS|4.0|This film is far below Jurassic Park but well above The Lost World (Jurassic Park II). It provides a decent story and set of characters as well as excellent dinosaurs to entertain the new viewer of Jurassic Park. Those who have seen the justifiably successful original JP will find some pleasure, as well, although much diluted from the original. Lost World is even more a film for newcomers only. For these latter viewers, probably the improvement in JP3 will make this reasonably good entertainment, For some reason, not made clear, a man and boy are hang-gliding (I think it is called) near an isolated island, quarantined by the owning country. They run into trouble and the last we see of them is their descent toward the island. A short while later, a noted paleontologist and his chief student assistant are inveigled into serving as  an expert guide to a man and wife who have permission to fly over this quarantined island at a sufficiently low level to see the animals. During that trip, they run into trouble and are forced to land. The rest you can guess in general terms. The plot is ancient, some talented actors do as good a job as can be done with their roles, the pre-historic animals are excellent although none comes close to having the personality of King Kong, and there are some good escape from threat scenes. Nothing at all novel, but, nonetheless probably quite enjoyable for children and modestly engaging for adults.

B0030IIZ3S|4.0|I love Toy Story 2, and personally think it is the most entertaining movie of the entire Toy Story trilogy.  However, I would caution against purchasing this item.  It contains the film, lots of bonus features such as deleted scenes, extra animated shorts, and of course the various interviews with cast and crew.  However, this two-disc combo in DVD packaging is missing what is probably the 2nd most important feature after the film itself, and that is the Pixar short Luxo Jr!  Yes, that is correct, Luxo Jr. is not present on either the Blu-ray disc or the DVD disc.  Other than this huge omission, this is a great product.  The movie is wonderful, the various disc menus are well-constructed and accompanied by the awesome music from the movie.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvire) witnesses the birth of a foal in Devon England during 1912.  As the young horse and young man grow up together they see each other often but the colt is indifferent to Albert's attentions.  Albert's alcoholic father goes to a horse auction in the village and gets in a bidding war with the landlord of his farm.  He overbids and buys the colt as a plow horse even though he is a thoroughbred.  Now after overpaying for the horse they are unable to pay the rent on the farm and face eviction by the domineering landlord.<br /><br />Albert tells is mom and dad that he will train and break the horse and help to use it to save the farm.  Albert names the horse Joey and an unbreakable bond is made between Albert and Joey.  Albert trains Joey to plow a rocky field to help save the farm as they have committed to plant turnips and pay the landlord his rent or be evicted.  After a major rainstorm and the loss of the crop, Albert's father sells Joey to the English Cavalry as WW I is just starting.<br /><br />Joey is off to war and Albert is heartbroken that he has lost his horse and his friend. Albert is to young to join the army but a short time later, Albert is in the army fighting in the hell of WW I and trench warfare over no-man's land...<br /><br />This movie is a wonderful and terrifying story about the bond between a man and his horse and the horrors of WW I.  Both fight to survive the cruelties of war and Albert's never ending search to find his prized horse are heart warming.  Both man and beast suffer terribly during the war and this movie brings forth the story of never giving up and finding your dream.<br /><br />While the book is touted as a children's story the movie is rated PG-13 and contains graphic violence and cruelty.  Just be aware of this if you want to watch this with younger children. Millions died fighting WW I and the movie pulls no punches while filming the horrible aspects of trench warfare and the use of artillery, machine guns and poisonous gas. The storyline is excellent and the acting throughout the movie is of the highest quality.  In typical Spielberg fashion the movie is video graphically displayed like an artist's canvas painted by a master.<br /><br />It is a good movie and you will enjoy it but it may not be suitable for the whole family is you have younger children!ine guns and poisonous gas.

0439023491|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!  This review is chock full of SPOILERS!  Please don't read if you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />The very hour I finished the Hunger Games, I ran right out and bought Catching Fire at the nearest bookstore, paying full price because I wasn't willing to wait the few days it would have taken to purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />I dove right in, reading page after page, waiting for the story to take off like it did in the first book.  A few hours later, I noticed the book mark was almost at the center of the book, and I was still waiting for it to get started.  I kept waiting for it to get good.  It never did.<br /><br />What bothers me the most is how Katniss went from being wicked smaht (as we say in Boston) to extraordinarily stupid.  Is this the same girl from the Hunger Games?  The same girl who figured out that when Haymitch sent her nothing, that was really a message meaning she was near water?  Is this the same girl who figured out that Foxface would have sensed a trap if Peeta had set the berries out as a trap?  The same girl who pulled out the berries?<br /><br />This girl was much smarter than I in the first book, and I admired her cleverness and resourcefulness.  Now I'm seeing things a mile ahead of her, while she is overlooking incredibly obvious signs!  The fact that they were sent 24 small breads was obviously a message.  She should have seen that right away.  She would have in the first book.<br /><br />And how many times does Finnick need to save Peeta's life before she'll trust him?  Finnick saves Peeta's life four frickin' times and she still doesn't trust him?  She still doesn't figure out something is up?<br /><br />The tracking device is ripped out of her arm and she doesn't figure it out?  This is not the same girl from the first book!<br /><br />I feel like Annie Wilkes after she read Misery's Child.  \\"Katniss is not that cocka-doodie stupid!\\"  I'm so angry I'm about to hobble someone!<br /><br />The one reason I've given two stars instead of one is my lingering fondness for its predecessor.<br /><br />I guess I'll still read the third one, Mockingjay, but I'm not rushing right out to buy it.  I'll order a used copy from Amazon.  Catching Fire extinguished my fire for this series (oh, snap!).iven two stars instead of one is my lingering fondness for its predecessor.<br /><br />I guess I'll still read the third one, Mockingjay, but I'm not rushing right out to buy it.

1741797802|1.0|I have travelled to India 10 times so far and been using Lonely Planet India guidebooks for 7 years, got my first one in 2004. I was very happy with them and each new edition was getting better and better, basically new places and maps were added, the book was expanding. The last 13th edition (published in Sept 2009) had 250 maps, they were very clear, showing often much more than just the city centre only, LP got it just right. I was very happy seeing a release of the new edition, as I am planning two trips to India very soon. Ordered the new guidebook and.. couldn't believe my eyes. LP changed their excellent maps! They are not as clear as they used to be, I find reading these new maps very hard, they use blue symbols now and road are marked in grey. Also maps are often much smaller, in the previous edition they covered much larger areas of cities. Also some maps are simply GONE, so there are quite a few cities without maps. The front cover of the 13th edition says \\"250 detailed and easy to use maps\\", in the new edition it is just written \\"196 maps\\" in small letters on the back cover (so 54 maps are gone?). They do not say \\"detailed and easy to use\\" anymore - not so proud about the maps this time? If it is not enough then imagine that some cities featured in the 13th edition are just gone, they are not in the book anymore (for example Daman in Gujarat).<br />What is new? The first 82 pages are in colour, so you get colorful maps of Delhi. There are also perspective plans/sketches of Taj Mahal and Red Fort, like the ones in the DK guides. I like them, but I feel they were added at the expense of the maps and places that got removed from the book. Each state has a different introduction too. And there is a fold-out map of Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. Basically everything is quite different now. We also get 1232 pages vs 1244 pages in the older edition. Also the paper quality is worse and the cover damages easily.<br />Also there is much less hotels listed and they are not grouped by a budget, midrange and top end category as before, but is some other confusing order.<br />I don't understand why changing a winning formula?<br />My advice? If you are going to visit sth more than Delhi and Agra then skip the 14th edition, get yourself the previous one. For my next trip to India I will be using again the 13th edition, the new one stays at home. I hope they get it right in the 15th one, but before bying it I will go to a bookshop and see how it's like. I hope they return to the previous form of maps and add more cities.<br />To summarize it: I might sound harsh, but I don't like this edition, it is a step back comparing to the previous one (or maybe just step in the wrong direction). 1 star from me, wasted money, as I will not use it for my future trips.<br /><br />update: LP seems to use this new design for other guidebooks - just got the latest 11th edition of Myanmar guidebook and it is as bad as the new India guide, what a shame...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If writers are Gods - and they are - then George R.R. Martin is Zeus, King of Gods. Martin flawlessly weaves a tale of epic fantasy to launch, which is arguably the best fantasy series ever ( I know The Lord of The Rings and The Malazan Empire have their fans). Game of Thorns achieves not only because of a great plot, which does not stagnate, but because of the intriguing characters, both male and female, that are brought to life through Martin's skill.  Tyrion, Sandor Clegane (the Hound), Cersei, Arya, and Daenerys are particularly memorable.<br /><br />This first installment is not heavily loaded with magic and the supernatural. Other than the appearance of a supernatural race in the opening pages and again briefly later on, and the emergence of other mythological creatures in the closing pages, Game of Thrones is devoid of magic and the supernatural. The conflict is among men and women, noble houses positioning themselves for the throne of a Kingdom. The book is laden with political intrigue, conspiracy, ambition, and hidden family secrets.<br /><br />Still, while the great houses maneuver for control of the throne, the reader is ever aware of a long dormant evil, that may rise to threaten the populace of the seven kingdoms.<br /><br />I am looking forward to getting into Clash of Kings & Storm of Swords and beyond.<br /><br />Matt Cole<br />Author of The Blood of Cowards
0439023521|5.0|Let me add my two cents to the masses.  I finally broke down and began reading the Hunger Games and I'm glad I did.  I loved the characters and the story.  Collins creates a fantastic world inside the arena.<br /><br />The pacing is non-stop.  She packs an incredible amount of action in one paragraph.  I didn't want to miss one word.<br /><br />A good book is hard to find.  You won't go wrong here.<br /><br />As a trilogy, that's another story, but the first book is EXCELLENT!

B007CKNX28|5.0|I'm a White Stripes fan and would have been thrilled with another White Stripes like album. What Blunderbuss is instead is a Jack White solo album. I'm happy it is.<br /><br />This album gives up some of the edge that the White Stripes albums had in exchange for a broader musical sound. Jack's amazing voice still comes through and the lyrics will get you to stop and listen, but there is a different feel and sound to this album. It's not Memphis R&B, but rather it's well-played rock music that is a throwback to the days when the focus of artists and producers was on making a good album and not a one or two auto-tuned, radio-friendly hits.<br /><br />If you were expecting another White Stripes album, you might be disappointed. If you like Jack White or simply appreciate a good rock and roll album, you'll be glad you bought this.<br /><br />-Charles Rotblut<br />Author, Better Good Than Lucky

1451629184|5.0|What is wrong with all of you that negatively committed on this book? It is obvious that Jaycee`s book is written in her words and not the words of a professional writer which is what makes it capture the heart. I loved the way her writing was a bit scattered and as she was writing about one memory it brought up others that she choose to share. Jaycee shared very personal parts of her life with her readers that gave insight to her journey both positive and negative. The fact that this young woman has the emotional capacity to function after what she has been forced to endure is in itself a miracle. To relive the 18 years of her life that monster took from her must have been hell. As a woman and a mother of a daughter about Jaycee`s age, some of her experiences were hard to read. Jayee shares enough of what she felt both physically and emotionally to give the reader insight into her years in the \\"backyard\\". I believe Jayee has the right to share only the information she is comfortable with. I for one consider it a privilege to have read this wonderful young women's very personal memoir and look forward to reading her next book of life after her rescue if she chooses to grace us with one. I have and will continue to recommend this book.

0399159029|4.0|Philip Kerr has one of the more interesting noir detective series going.  Bernie Gunther is a private detective in pre-WWII Berlin who is often forced into working with and for the governing Nazi party in order solve several murders, disappearances and assorted crimes.  Somehow he survives the ongoing power struggles and frequent double-crossings with his skin intact.  This early portion of Bernie's career is covered in Kerr's well-known \\"Berlin Noir Trilogy\\".<br /><br />Prague Fatale is the 8th in the series and takes place in 1941.  Bernie is back working for \\"Kripo\\", the Kriminalpolizei, attempting to solve the mysterious death of a railroad worker.  In the process he stops an attack on a young woman, who curiously has a lot of information about various characters in the Nazi hierarchy and the Berlin underworld.  Bernie falls for this woman, Arianne, and soon he is relying on her contacts and information to solve his unfolding criminal case.<br /><br />But, as has happened in previous installments in the series, Bernie's skills as a dogged detective and political tightrope walker, come to the attention of the Nazi higher-ups.  The newly appointed  Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich,  has commandeered a palatial home in the country outside Prague (stolen from Jews) and is settling in to begin applying his iron control over the people of what is now the Czech Republic.  Bernie is brought along by Heydrich to find out who among the guests at the celebration of his new appointment is involved in a plot to kill him.  Bernie secretly brings along Arianne and installs her in a hotel in Prague.  A sort of Agatha Christie-like country house murder mystery is soon set in motion when a member of Heydrich's staff is murdered and Bernie has to find the murderer among Heydrich's many high-powered guests.<br /><br />Kerr skillfully inserts his fictional detective into real-life historical events.  Bernie continues to feel disdain for Nazi principles and practices while somehow managing to retain Heydrich's confidence and make progress in solving the murder.  But, Arianne soon emerges as a key player in the intrigue, deception and mayhem that follows this murder.  Kerr once again manages to create a very vivid depiction of the nightmarish world inside the Nazi vortex and brings plot lines and characters (real and fictional) to a very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />\\"Prague Fatale' actually occurs before the opening events of \\"Field Gray\\", the previous novel in this series.  But in each succeeding novel Kerr uses time shifts to fill in chunks of Bernie Gunther's career continuum.  This newest addition is a strong and welcome addition to one of the best noir series going.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|Something you'll notice if you read any of these reviews is that a good portion of the 'bad' reviews compare this movie to the first Ghost Rider movie.  Well, I have a problem with that.  I have been a long time fan of the Ghost Rider going back to the Original 70's comics.  The first movie which purports to give us the origin of the Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider has next to nothing to do with the source material at all.  The first movie turned Johnny Blaze into a goofball who eats Jelly Beans out of a martini glass and keeps the powers of the Ghost Rider against the will of the Devil.  If you like that then you are no fan of the Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze was a hard drinking, tortured soul who was tricked by the 'devil' and turned into the Ghost Rider against his will.  He spent the entire run of the original comic series doing everything he could to be freed from his curse.  Johnny Blaze doesn't listen to the Carpenters.  Johnny Blaze doesn't watch TV specials about monkeys.  He's not got time for that crap.<br /><br />This movie, while it does have it's own problems, plays closer to the 'real' Ghost Rider in every way.  Blaze fights the demon for control constantly.  He seeks an escape from the Spirit of Vengeance at every turn, but he uses the Ghost Rider to his advantage at times.  THIS is the spirit of the original book brought to life.  Not the campy crap-fest that the first movie was.  While the writers did take some creative licence with characters, parts of the origin, and pretty much completely ignore the first film (thank god), they build a rider that is much more like the one we see in the pages of the Ghost Rider comics.  This movie brings us a darker, more menacing Ghost Rider.  When the Rider is on screen, he's unsettling.  He revels in the destruction and death going on around him.  He laughs maniacally as he uses massive mining machines infused with hell-fire to destroy his enemies, and toys with them like a cat would a wounded mouse...<br /><br />The 'enemies' of the rider in the first film were epic emo-fairy failures.  They are easily dispatched and offer no real challenge for the Rider.  Well, the same can be said about this movie, but at least here they are outmatched by the rider because they are mere mortals facing off against a demon/angel of vengeance/justice.  When the 'heavies' show up in the form of Blackout and finally the Devil, they aren't much of a challenge either, but then again they put up a better fight than the ones in the first film.<br /><br />Blackout is not the Blackout from the comic, but here he is realized better than most comic book movie villains.  He puts up a fight but there's never really much danger for the Ghost Rider from any of the bad guys.<br /><br />Where this film falls apart is that the story is at times confusing, Cage often jumps into 'Crazy Cage' mode and ruins some scenes, and a lot of the dialog is just silly.  Where it succeeds is the Crank-style mayhem that is unleashed whenever there is action going on, the visual effects of the Rider are ramped up and embrace the dark side of the Character.  The Flaming Skull in this go around is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than in the first.  In every way possible the Rider is BETTER rendered here in character and appearance.<br /><br />See this if you are a fan of the Ghost Rider and not the first Movie that tried to make the Ghost Rider into a Spiderman style super-hero.  THIS is the heart of the Ghost Rider.  Dark, Gritty, Campy and FUN!  Now if they would just ditch Cage and get a decent writer to give a third movie a go...

0811879542|2.0|I bought this book for my two boys (ages 2 & 4) based solely on reviews and the information presented on Amazon. We live overseas and don't have access to an English-language library, so I like to invest in new books for my boys periodically. At the time of my purchase, it had 51 reviews and all were 5-star. I liked the concept of the book & thought with 51 5-star reviews I couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />First, the quality of the book itself was not what I expected. It is listed as \\"hardcover\\" but instead of a typical hardcover construction, the cover is more like that of a board book. When viewed from above, you can see the layers of pressed cardboard that comprise the cover. We have had this book for less than six months and the cover is already warped and peeling a bit on the edges.<br /><br />Second, the content... While I do appreciate the concept of the book - simple and interactive - I was disappointed from the first read. I still kept an open mind for my kids' sake and while my four-year-old does enjoy it, he also never requests for it to be read. It doesn't really hold my two-year-old's attention to begin with. It has an interesting novelty factor, but seems to be quickly forgotten by my boys.<br /><br />When we reach the last line, \\"Want to do it all over again?\\" I find myself thinking, \\"let's not!!\\" Had we had the opportunity to check this out from a library first, I would not have chosen to buy it.

B0054U53WG|5.0|In The Plex<br />How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives<br />Steven Levy<br /><br />Wired magazine senior writer Steven Levy takes the reader on a ride starting with Google's co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin searching for interesting projects as a part of their PhD at Stanford in the mid 90s. It wasn't long before they started to cram their dormitory room with inexpensive servers and applied Brin's data mining system to build their search engine. The program became popular at Stanford and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garage.<br /><br />Levy gives a good account how the young founders' personalities, drive, intellect and highly mathematical skills coalesced converting a piece of insight into an application that would be used millions of times a day. In fact, according to comScore, there were 14.3 billion searches performed in March 2009 in the U.S alone.<br /><br />The book gives a fascinating glimpse into how the search engine evolved, the tweaks, and the incorporation of hundreds of \\"signals\\" to ensure that google returned the most relevant search result. For example, Levy quotes one of the search engineers Amit Singhal working on synonyms \\"we discovered very early nifty things, people change words in their queries. So someone would say `pictures of dos' and then they'll say pictures of puppies'. That said that maybe dogs and puppies were interchangeable\\".<br /><br />He also goes on to say \\"we also learned that when you boil water, it's hot water. We were learning semantics from humans, and that was a great advance\\". But problems also emerged. Google's synonym system came to understand that a dog was similar to a puppy and that boiling water was hot. But its engineers also discovered that the search engine considered that a hot dog was the same as a boiling puppy.<br />Levy provides us with Singhal's account of how this was resolved. Singhal says, the breakthrough came in late 2002 that utilized Lugwig Wittegensteins theories on how words are defined by context. As Google crawled and archived billions of documents and web pages, it analysed which words were close to each other. \\"Hot dog\\" would be found in searches that also contained \\"bread\\" and \\"mustard\\" and \\"baseball games\\" - not \\"puppies with roasting fur\\".<br /><br />As key people joined Google, they bought with them expertise as well as beliefs which Levy goes to great length to describe their contribution and the manner they shape Google today. The book, as much as anything else explores Google's culture, history and technology and includes the Internet giant's troubled foray into China, and its intensifying rivalry with Facebook.<br /><br />The inner workings of search and integration with advertising is extremely interesting chapter - describing the founders priority in providing the best search result independent from how much a firm has paid for key-word based ads.<br /><br />Just when the reader thinks they know about all that has happened inside the Googleplex (the corporate headquarters Google, in Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California) Levy reveals that former CEO Eric Schmidt tried to get information about a political donation he had made scrubbed from Google's search engine.<br /><br />Also, that Page and Brin had to be schooled by former Vice President Al Gore about proper behavior in China as Google prepared to do business there, and he describes Google's inability to understand the very different rules of doing business in China, firing a Chinese manager after she used her expense account to buy iPods as gifts for Chinese government officials - a typical business custom in China.<br />If there is anything that I would have liked to seen covered - that would be the impact Google has on everyday life, work and education. Perhaps that's all for another day and another book.theories on how words are defined by context.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I don't mind movies that are out of the norm, but this movie is ridiculous. The story rambles everywhere, and the lengthy beginning-of-the-world/dinosaur sequence makes little sense in relation to the rest of the movie. And this received a Best Picture nomination? There's nothing visionary here. This is pretentious garble passed off as art, and just like a red toilet being passed off as art in a modern art gallery, there are people silly enough to buy in.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|WOW, this book is about much more than a memory contest. We learn about oral history and how it developed, the history of books, the human brain, how stories are passed on, what brain damage can do, that there is no such thing as a photographic memory, how to improve your athletic and typing skills, autism, the \\"smartest\\" person in the world, and a zillion more fascinating tidbits.<br /><br />Seriously, there are so many entertaining and valuable facts on every page, it's overwhelming.  Foer reminds me a bit of Bill Bryson, who can take something and deconstruct it to reveal stuff that you didn't know existed - and make you really think about it.<br /><br />There is a lot to take away here, so keep the book handy. Chances are you won't be able to remember it all!

B007CKNX28|5.0|After hearing \\"Love Interruption,\\" I was not sure how I was going to feel about this album. However, after purchasing this album, I must say I'm blown away. Jack White has always been a talented musician and songwriter. In Blunderbuss, Jack shows that he can succeed in many genres of music. The variety and versatility is a major selling point of the album. \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" is reminiscent of The White Stripes, \\"Love Interruption\\" is acoustic blues with a Jack White flair and \\"I'm Shakin\\" pays homage to Bo Diddley and other classic rock greats. This is absolutely a must buy album and it is shaping up to be my favorite album of 2012 so far!

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|The Snowman was my first Jo Nesbo book.  If you think the Swedish are stoic, you haven't met a Norwegian! Still, I found myself drawn into the investigation and characters.  Nesbo loves to throw out red herrings along with the clues, and he is brilliant with the twists.  Harry doesn't just brood. There is lots of action along with character and story development. I still am wondering about a few things in his apartment...Can't wait to read the next!

B0067EKY7M|4.0|\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is a romantic comedy-drama genre film.<br /><br />The denotations and connotations of the narrative are guided around salmon fishing, yet there are micro and macro implications as a result of this. On one hand the idea of bringing salmon fishing to the Yemen presents as a wishful and near impossible task. On the other hand the viewer is presented with a situation where this same goal allows people of different circumstances and racial and cultural backgrounds to find unison working on the project.<br /><br />The film characters are all unique and developing salmon fishing bonds them as a group, which helps them through their own personal challenges, and to find a spark that is missing in their lives.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B007J4T2G8|3.0|How could I not read a book that has gotten so much press?<br />\\"Fifty Shades\\" is the first in a trilogy that some wonks are calling \\"the newest chick erotica\\" and \\"a great love story.\\"<br />The tale  of Ana and Christian is potentially great fantasy. Virgin Ana finds her rich sex/soul mate. Impossibly wealthy and physically perfect messed up loner dominator Christian discovers his ideal submissive.<br /><br />And women of America are turned on by being voyeurs in their journey.<br />Marriages are magically renewed and readers are purportedly having sex three times a day..thanks to GREY.<br /><br />So, I say, keep an open mind, it's really not that intense! Maybe you'll like the story and concept, and it won't hurt...bad pun.<br /><br />That's the good stuff.  The bad stuff is this is a badly written book with lots of one dimensional characters that I didn't believe for a second. The \\"love\\" scenes are rather  repetitive and James calls on \\"Aargh\\" to describe ecstasy way too many times. Drop the Johnny Depp  outbursts and get a thesaurus already. (at least  Depp is sexy!).<br /><br />There's plenty of page filler emails between our lovers  - complete with addressee and subject info - and (don't we all HATE this) a full copy of the previous thread. Oh, how contemporary. But they are boring (\\"good night\\" \\"go to sleep\\" ad nauseum.)<br /><br />Apparently our heroine has never looked in the mirror for 23 years and is clueless that she is attractive. No one has really hit on her, despite living with a wild roommate and going to an urban university...not exactly a recluse.<br /><br />Our brilliant Master of the Universe hero can't find a decent partner; actually, he has never tried (despite being an uber achiever). Luckily, Ana literally falls into his life.<br /><br />The rules he sets on the relationship are the basis for their discussions and are probably the most interesting parts of the book.<br />Don't despair, James has Ana research the gross (to some people) ones offstage.  That avoids some important observations, such as why this guy would even consider doing THAT  stuff.<br /><br />I am not a literary snob, but prefer the sex to be part of a fully fleshed story with more dimension. If I am going to suspend belief, make it for great juicy characters.<br /><br />But, heck, give it a CRACK.
B0058S0OMS|4.0|I am a fan of the Halloween franchise, good, bad or indifferent.  Every one of the movies have their strong points, even the infamous Halloween III and The Curse of Michael Myers.  The remakes are fine too, incredibly violent and warped as they may be.  I won't waste time talking about the movie.  There's plenty of reviews doing that.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is a very clean visual transfer for as old as the source material is.  In some ways it's a little too clean with the color enhancement, as you lose some of the \\"autumn midwest\\" feel for the plush green Los Angeles reality in a few scenes.  Otherwise it's a beautiful transfer with only a few minor blemishes here and there.  Overall the best visuals of any previous Halloween II release.<br /><br />The opening credits looked a little different for some reason, but I can't place my finger on it.  I'll have to watch my Universal DVD again to find out for sure.<br /><br />Interestingly, the sound is somewhat inferior to the Universal DVD.  Sure, it's as crisp and clean a sound as could be expected for a movie this old, but it seems to be toned down a little more than on the DVD.  For instance, the barking doberman early in the film and the late-for-work nurse knocking on the glass hospital door did not make my heart skip a few beats as on the DVD.  If you're expecting it, the DVD really makes no difference.  But if you're distracted, the DVD definitely wakes you up on these kinds of scenes, whereas the Blu Ray is not as likely to get your attention.  The sound is a little flatter in my opinion.<br /><br />Sadly, the deleted scenes are located elsewhere on the disc.  They are not enhanced for 1080p like the feature presentation, but still clean despite the noticeable grain.  They are not presented in their original 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  Instead, they are offered only in the cropped full-screen television format.  The alternate ending is not included in the deleted scenes menu, though it does appear as a secondary menu option.<br /><br />In my opinion the ultimate Halloween II Blu Ray edition would have the deleted scenes added back into the main feature but without the alternate ending.  Perhaps yet another version will be released with these changes.  I would definitely pay for another copy of this movie.  After all, I have at least 4 Anchor Bay releases of Halloween, including the unrated Extended Edition.  Now they did that one right: the original R-rated version (brief nudity and all) with the made for TV scenes (2.35:1 retro \\"1978\\" scenes that were shot during the filming of Halloween II in 1981) spliced in; not a true TV version but certainly a perfect extended version.  Why couldn't they do the same for this one?  They still can.  I'll eagerly await it.<br /><br />As for the other extras, I have no idea why they added Terror in the Isles as an extra but it's not a bad piece of work.  I would much rather have seen original TV commercial spots, heard radio clips, and seen a \\"making of\\" documentary or at least some behind the scenes photo stills.<br /><br />My conclusion: the Blu Ray is definitely worth the price.  No overt disappointments.  Alas, I want another release as described above.  Until then, I'll hang onto my Blu Ray and my Universal DVD.  I'll also snag an old copy of the Good Times Video DVD release.  I love the cool moving/live action video clips on the chapter menus.  Those should have been carried over to Blu Ray as well.<br /><br />Worth the money.[[ASIN:B0058S0OMS Halloween II (30th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]ption.<br /><br />In my opinion the ultimate Halloween II Blu Ray edition would have the deleted scenes added back into the main feature but without the alternate ending.

B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie is the most under rated film in years, if not decades!  The story, while a lot to take Ina at first settles in and resolves itself incredibly well!  The payoff is so great, and the foundation that is built for further stories is enough to make you want it to keep going. For movie of this length you don't ever notice. By the time passes it leaves you still wanting more. The visuals are stunning, and the quality of production top notch. If you love fantasy, scifi, or just a great epic story, this movie is for you!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm on a budget and didn't require the most expensive Nikon speedlight available. This speedlight is a great value and is easy to install. It is a perfect addition when you need a higher level of flash than the built-in flash offered on your Nikon. I was going to purchase a general flash at a much cheaper price, but I was worried about compatibility issues with my Nikon D300. I am using the flash both indoors and outdoors, and it is a powerful flash for the portrait and fashion photography that I engage in.<br /><br />I paired my Nikon speedlight with Westcott's Micro Apollo Soft Box. Both work well together, so I am very satisfied with my purchase.
0307352145|5.0|I love this book! I first listened to the audio version, and now have ordered it in print.  I'm sure all of the other reviews have more than covered the synopsis of the contents, so I'm not going to cover the same territory again.  I will just say that this book explains more about me to myself than any other \\"personality analysis system\\" from Freud to astrology ever has.  To think that all along I just thought I was weird for playing the extrovert when I had to, and despite being dubbed a leader and pushed into extrovert leadership roles from an early age, I always knew all I really wanted was to get by myself and be surrounded by peace and quiet. Turns out I'm not weird after all (well, not in this way at least), and am, in fact, in very good company.  This book explains it all---what an enlightening and major contribution to understanding ourselves and those around us, despite the way we and they often \\"seem.\\"
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I love, love, love the first 3 Indiana Jones films.  And I don't really mind the 4th.  BUT, I already own Crystal Skull on blu-ray and I refuse to buy it twice.  The trend with these Collection releases (LOTR Extended, Jurassic, Star Wars) has been to release them in one collection with no chance to purchase them individually and I'm guessing that this collection will follow that trend.  Paramount, I would be delighted to give you my money for the original 3 films, but there is no way in heck that I will you give you my money for a second copy of Crystal Skull.<br />  I'm sure that someone is going to come along an criticize me for giving 2 stars to a collection that has yet to be released.  However this is not meant as a review of the films (there are thousands of reviews of these films available) rather this is a review of the greedy nature of this release.
B003VWU2WA|3.0|The unit works and is well built from what I can tell.  On Windows 7 the initial startup went fine but then I could not get the software to reopen in order to edit the settings.  After contacting Griffin I find that you must click on the arrow at the lower right of your screen which brings up a tray of icons.  You can then open the software again.  Pretty dumb way to do it.  Nowhere does it say this in any of the documentation or instructions.<br /><br />Other than that the thing works as it should and is a welcome addition to the desktop.

0345803485|3.0|I have friends who LOVE this book! I mean LOVE. The book is very forward and deals with a large amount of sex between a dom and sub. I'm not well versed in how that type of relationship works. What I will tell you is that this book and the the one that follows (I have yet to read the third) are very predictable and despite an attempt at a love story it seems like a number of dirty scenes with filler in between. Similar to the every annoying \\"That's what she said\\" jokes this book takes every attempt at the more erotic verbal play on similar situations. She bites her lip, they have sex, she gets spanked he makes a sexy comment they go at it again. The author does make an attempt at a back story but that plays out much later. The first book is simply built up sexual tension and the release of it. So if you like the written dirty, you'll be down with this.<br /><br />The book isn't terrible, not at all.  It's not great though either. It's a book that I think you'll either love or feel as though you know every four pages there will be something dealing with sex. I knew this book had this in it, I wasn't mislead but I think part of the reason that I didn't necessarily love this book (unlike my friends) is that it lacked character development and that is the reason why I continue to read the next books. The second book does take you closer into the past of the characters and gives you a better idea of  love, abuse and fine line between. I would have like to see a story line in this book or some type of challenging event and as the writer attempts to do that with her characters acceptance of sexual preferences, it's not enough to make me want to re-read this book. It's written in a very simple gummed manner where it can be read very quickly and because of that I'm contemplating on returning the book as I found it to be something I could have written and who wants to read that? (LOL).<br /><br />Honestly I would recommend this book to a friend, I think it's just one of thosebooks you have to read to decide if you like. The reviews are helpful but in the long run it'll either move you are not. I was like \\"are you serious!\\" the entire time I read while my one friend said she was smiling and worked up while reading it. This book is about sex and honestly it takes all kinds and to each their own.<br /><br />I will tell you that as much as I want to love Ana and Gray I just can't connect with them but I wish you luck in your readings! Everyone is reading this book and everyone is talking about it. Love it, hate it but give it a try or at least borrow it from a friend. :)<br /><br />(I apologize for spelling and grammatical errors)

1401937268|5.0|like many others, ive been waiting for a tarot deck that was full of positive energy, images and messages. i figured if i wanted to own atleast one tarot deck, it'd be an angel themed one. i absolutely love the artwork. i love how it stays true to how tarot artwork represents each suit, like how many cups or wands you can find in each card it represents. the very first reading i did with these cards was for myself asking about finding a soulmate and it was dead-on accurate! i mean, down to a T accurate lol! i know sometimes i have felt some of doreen's angel cards have been \\"scary\\" accurate at times but nothing quite like this o.o but i love that its all positive and uplifting. my only problem with it is thats really hard to shuffle. i have pretty petite hands so i have to split the deck in half and shuffle each half individually because its such a large deck. the cards are pretty thick too but i suppose they just need to be broken in a little more. but otherwise i love this deck for being really accurate and beautiful and for that i dont feel i need to rate it being just for being hard to shuffle. for what its worth, i'll definitely keep working with it. thank you, doreen, radleigh, and steve for creating such a wonderful deck!

0439023521|5.0|Watched the movie the weekend it first came out and did not know anything of the story. After watching it, I had to buy the book!  Love that I found it for cheap on here.  Great and fast service from the seller!
1401937268|5.0|I love the architecture of the cards.  They mimic the traditional Tarot Card format.  Though they replace the suits with elements and add a few cards of their own.<br /><br />I love the number thirteen and that divides 78 by 6.  Numbers are secondary to me but \\"I love it when a plan comes together\\".<br /><br />If I were to make the cards myself?  I would make the back of the cards an emerald, forest, color.  I would also like more hyper-realism in the fantastical artwork, instead of the current cartoonist slapping of some paint together.  I like the art, and love the cards, it is my new favorite deck.  However, those are the two things I would do to make it \\"perfect\\" in my humble opinion. {I.M.H.O.}<br /><br />If Doreen reads this and investigates the idea further?  I suggest making the images more dynamic and less posing.  I mean, as if the photo catches them in the middle of one of their Divine duties, actions.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|[[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]I struggled to get through this book, which is really saying something since the writing style is so simple.  I wonder why her publisher didn't have her go back and flesh out the ending to the story!  So much of it seemed pointless.  It's not that I have a problem with it being dark, my problem was that the story was painfully slow and ended in a very unsatisfying way.  It was bad enough to taint my memories of the two earlier books in the trilogy.
0545265355|5.0|Loved these books.  The story line was great!  My preteen daughter and I read them aloud together, and she is now reading them alone a second time.  This is a great story to read with your child.  It has all the drama, suspense, surprises, and action all preteens and teens love.  We read the story before seeing the movie and cannot wait for the next movie to come out, but as my daughter said, \\"the books are always better then the movie\\". Also, I priced this set in several stores and Amozon had the best price!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a tragic book on so many levels.  Why choose to involve young innocent people in these games? Suzanne Collins has written a thought provoking book with well developed characters that compel us to turn the page again and again. Let's hope no nation ever develops into a Panem!
B004KRQFI0|1.0|Just when I thought popular music couldn't get any worse! This stuff is just plain awful. It's all made by computers and takes no real talent. If you like to listen to it I guess that's fine, but I just don't get it.Why anyone would listen to this, much less pay money for it is beyond me. I feel like my brain's gonna melt and run out of my ears when I hear this stuff. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer music with coherent lyrics played on instruments to this crap.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was amazing! I never knew what the Hunger Games was about until I saw the preview for the movie. After talking to people who have read the books and them giving me a brief synopsis of it, I was still hesitant, but thought what the heck! So I ordered the trilogy and could not put it down! The first book was the best and the third started off a little slow, but was worth it! I finished the book in 5 days(this was with me forcing myself to put it down so I would still have more to read the next day) and I was so sad when it was finished. One of the best books I have read in a long time and even though I was disappointed in the first movie i know I will go and see the others as well! :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my dad has this on his phone so I would use it.but this is great! I was waiting for it for my kindle fire forever! this is the best.u should royalty get it!
B001TH16DI|2.0|I just received this blue ray series of the first movies and star trek #3 the search for Spock is not here. All the other ones are here but #3 how can I get there movie that was to be in the series?????
0345803485|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey book is a powerful, moving book that will have you wanting more. I was shocked at first with all the adult content in the book, seemed like the first encounter between the 2 of them I needed to smoke a cig for them and then as the book continued I felt like a 6 pk of beer would be better.<br />Through out the book I was amazed and at awe with the relationship between Ana and Christian. I was astonished at the end of the first book<br />The writing will astond you and make you want more, not more in the way of their sexual relationship, but their personal relationship with each other. I believe that the writing is just amazing, it leaves you wanting more, but also makes you longing for a happy ending<br />I would recommend this book to a person who can look past the sex and into the real heart of this book.<br />Love it now I am ordering the next one in the series..ty for writing this
0439023491|5.0|After going to see the movie my son and I just had to know what happened next...Love the books!!  Everyone should really read the books before seeing the movies...there is so much more to the stories than the movie can tell!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this second book of the Hunger Games series. Very well written and an interesting commentary on today's society.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|works great and fun to play but I wish I could do more at once. you need energy to do everything and the only way to get it is wait it out or try to get it from friends. besides that fun game.
B007WZ7ILK|5.0|While the voices lack the purity of their youth the sound is unmistakably Beach Boys and is easily the best single since the heyday of the group in the late 1960's. I can't wait to see if the album matches the quality of this song.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Runs good, and looks good on the kindle fire! I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this to come out ever sense I got it on my phone..this game just got a lot easier!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game ever I love that u get to do an ice age zoo I Also love themovies and Sid and Manny and elly and crash I love them
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I first read the book - actually all 3 during my 5 day bed ridden week due to the flu. At first, I had a hard time getting through these BUT I have reread these twice since then. Beautifully written and can we agree, hot?!? There are issues I had to work through to enjoy the book like the whole dom/submissive positions at first, but again, after all of that - it is a fast, amazing, and extremely hot read. I hope to see more from this author!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Well its a good app but I read a text tonight that read: if you don't forward this you will die a brutal death. so now I am safe.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|not what i was expecting. how disappointing.  A great potential story distroyed by absolute filth.  i didn't even get very far when i stopped reading and erased the book from my kindle.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I ordered the Hunger Games to my Kindle and it was delivered in seconds. I started reading it right after that. This is a great series to order.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I played this game for a week straight..It was fun &amp; addicting..I didn't want to put it down...after about a week I couldn't collect on anything in the game..the timers were messing up pretty bad. I'm so disappointed..I wasted a whole week invested into this game pish!!! :'(( I'm deleting this game after I'm finished writing my review. I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the glitches..
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game if u are wanting to pass time. I play this on my kindle fire when I have some free time.
0345803485|1.0|Wow, with all the hype about this book, I really had higher expectations. I could only get halfway through, it was just so boring. I know there's a lot of talk about the \\"hot\\" sex scenes, but for all the graphic nastiness, the main character Ana is still repetitively saying \\"Oh please\\", \\"Oh my\\" and \\"Inner goddess\\" about every paragraph, and she even refers to her lady parts as her \\"sex\\"... are we 12? She's biting her lip about every other sentence and Christian is constantly calling her \\"baby\\". The plot is weak and it was just so cheesy that I couldn't get into it. I was actually laughing aloud at some parts. I also found the main character Ana to be irritatingly weak, and Christian mostly came off as a douche. This book wasn't for me. I couldn't finish it.
B005ER6SNM|2.0|I didn't buy this product through Amazon.com, instead I downloaded the uncut version through an unliscensed movie download site.  I really don't have much to say about the movie, except that it (shockingly!) isn't really shocking, provocative, or groundbreaking in any way.  The whole film is just.. well... it's really not very good.  It's an odd combination of hard-core porn, \\"torture porn\\", and recovered memory thriller somewhat in the vein of \\"Memento\\".  If you want to see lots of fevered thrusting, engorged d***s, and a little bit of family suicide mixed in, go for it.  If you're actually in the mood for a provocative film that is unsettlingly violent yet also has a deeper message, go for Martyrs.<br />[[ASIN:B001MEJY8W Martyrs]]
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Love love love this game, but we have two kindle fires and it won't let us play against each other.  It keeps telling me I am playing from multiple devices.:(
B007SYWFRM|3.0|this game is very creative and imagination, but many things cost too much and don't give you enough money and acorns for the things you need.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|If you have not seen this film, then I highly suggest renting it.  It grim, the acting is wonderful, and has one of the best endings of any book/movie that I have read or watched.  I think I've seen it about 20 times and still watch it from time to time.  The pacing is very well done, the music outstanding, and I always enjoy watching it.  The message is wonderful, no matter how dark or dreary, no matter how loathsome life can become, there is always hope.  There is always a way to get out and start again.  The only regret I have for this film is that it wasn't highly considered in the award season because it came out the same year Forest Gump did.
B0061S073A|5.0|It's a little time consuming with the various password screens but it keeps my kids from messing up the rest of my phone...and that's worth the hassle.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|The options for positioning are lacking.  I would like to see a a hand strap like the leather version.  The hard case is nicely protective.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. Have played awhile but have to purchase to move forward fast..if you download I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B007UXSPK2|1.0|How many times can a man be disavowed by his employer and still come back to work for them? I found myself more concerned with Ethan Hawk's 401K then anything else. Did he roll it over after being disavowed? Did he have to pay the 10% penalty? His CPA's head must be swimming with the constant being fired and rehired. Crap, I hope his health insurance didn't lapse either. By the way, the movie sucks. Cruise ran around, climbed buildings, drove cars fast and got the bad guy. Boring and nothing new at all.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|I read these books when I was in grade school and the series has always held a place in my heart as classic sci-fi.  The movie... one of the few ones where I have gone to the rest room and debated whether or not to go back in or just leave.  Nine bucks though... ugh I guess I should go back in and sit down.  For me it was a very bad rip off of avatar.  Acting was bad, script was worse, and I had no attachment to the characters whatsoever.  It did make me want to go back and read the book again though, if nothing more than to justify my fond (if rather vague... its been some time) memories of it.
0345803485|5.0|I had heard about this book several times and was curious why all the hype.  Read a small excerpt from it and purchased all three volumes at once.  When I opened it and started reading, I wasn't so sure that I wanted to finish it since the the male was so \\"extreme.\\"  I thought it rather vulgar but found that I couldn't put it down.  I am more than half way through the first volume and already anticipating the second and third.<br />Forget the parts that make you want to trash it because it's \\"dirty\\" and enjoy the love story.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|fun to play. easy to play and just like Mario brothers it is addicting. glad it was free as wouldn't want to pay for duplicate style game but fun non the less.
B000002KIK|5.0|This album is a real gem and it's a shame that most people only prefer the earlier Ozzy era albums. Just give this great album a real chance and you will like it! So underrated! Favorite songs for me are \\"Never Say Die\\", \\"Johnny Blade\\", and \\"Hard Road\\".
0321544080|3.0|This is a book for for people who can invest a lot of money on photography. I am giving three stars as this book does not describe many techniques which involve very few or less expensive accessories. Also, I am interested more in street photography/candid photography. There weren't as many techniques related to that!<br /><br />But the photographs and techniques listed in the book are stunning! An excellent book if you are considering photography as a profession or if you have too much money to buy accessories to try out the techniques :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app. I love the bookmark &amp; highlight options they are excellent tools for when I'm reading a passage.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. its addicting and is fun for the kids too. they love dectorating there own town and taking care of the animals. its a good money management lesson too.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|great game<br />keeps you playing without having to go to a walkthrough lots of fun worth .99 cents 4 sure.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game BUT....<br />it is a game where they will try to get you to buy stuff.<br />I would do the free stuff....like Join Netflix and with the gold coins you get you should be able to finish it.<br /><br />You can beat the 50 levels by merely SAVING PACHINKO balls as long as you can.<br />One you get a couple hundred saved up....fire them rapidly. This will get the multiplier<br />to 5x and then you get a lot of money, prizes and charms.<br /><br />The charms will help to beat the bosses every 10 levels.<br /><br />After you go through 50 levels it starts over.<br />On my Galaxy SII it freezes on the 2nd level when playing through the 2nd time and the graphics get a bit weird as well.
B0024Y7H10|5.0|This shows builds off of the movies terminator 1 and 2 and takes a completely different approach than 3 and 4. I enjoyed the movies, but they were just OK, this show is better by far. There is more in depth character formation and it was just an overall better story. The worst thing about the series was that it ended very open ended, as it was getting very interesting. I would love to see a season three, but its probably too late for that. I hate how series always end in the middle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app looked like a lot of fun when I first saw it. The game consists of many different mini-games that are really fun.
1401937268|4.0|I was anxious to receive this deck. Being all the cards were supposed to be friendly, gentle, and safe, I was curious to see how Doreen Virtue and Radleigh Valentine interpreted the traditional Tarot cards. The deck is a full 78 cards, and are the same size(3.5\\" x 5\\")and card stock as all of Doreen's Oracle cards, which does make this deck a little difficult to shuffle. The images on these cards are quite detailed and stunning, so I can see why they wanted to use the larger cards. There are keywords on the bottom of each card which makes this deck great for beginners of Tarot. The court cards not only have the keywords listed, but at the top there are 4 'personality' traits associated with that card; this is a plus for those that have trouble with court cards.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />Five of Air (swords) says: An unwise choice. Learn what you can from this situation. Review everyone's motives.<br /><br />Four of Earth (pentacles) says: Being too frivolous or too cautious with money. Good business decisions. Giving to those less fortunate.<br /><br />Page of Fire (wands) says: Outgoing, Creative, Confident, Mischievous and News of an exciting new endeavour. Use your originality and ingenuity.<br /><br />The suits of the Minor Arcana are Fire (wands), Water (cups), Air (swords), and Earth (pentacles). The courts are the traditional Page, Knight, Queen, & King.<br /><br />Fire = Dragons<br />Water = Mermaids<br />Air = Unicorns<br />Earth = Faeries<br /><br />Each suit of the Minor Arcana cards are a different colour, which is a really nice aspect. The Major Arcana is purple. For those who follow the traditional Rider-Waite numbering it might be a little disappointing to find out that in this deck, Justice and Strength are switched with Justice being card 8 and Strength moving to card 11. Each of the Major Arcana are associated with an Archangel and some have been renamed to make them gentler. They are as follows:<br /><br />~<br />0 - The Fool is called The Dreamer<br />5 - The Hierophant is called Unity<br />12 - The Hanged Man is called Awakening<br />13 - Death is called Release<br />14 - Temperance is renamed Balance<br />15 - The Devil is referred to as Ego'<br />16 - The Tower is renamed Life Experience<br />20 - Judgement is Renewal<br />~<br /><br />It's important to note that while most of the cards do depict the symbolism of Tarot, this doesn't have the feel of a typical Tarot Deck, but more of a oracle deck; not just because of the size but also the look of the images and the keywords on each card, etc. While this is a Tarot deck on all accounts, I was definitely expecting something different than what was in the box. However, overall this is a very nice deck and if you like other Doreen Virtue decks and are interested in adding a friendly and stunning Tarot deck to your collection, it's definitely one to consider.<br /><br />To see all 78 images from this deck visit innersoulwhispers.comeamer<br />5 - The Hierophant is called Unity<br />12 - The Hanged Man is called Awakening<br />13 - Death is called Release<br />14 - Temperance is renamed Balance<br />15 - The Devil is referred to as Ego'<br />16 - The Tower is renamed Life Experience<br />20 - Judgement is Renewal<br />~<br /><br />It's important to note that while most of the cards do depict the symbolism of Tarot, this doesn't have the feel of a typical Tarot Deck, but more of a oracle deck; not just because of the size but also the look of the images and the keywords on each card, etc. While this is a Tarot deck on all accounts, I was definitely expecting something different than what was in the box.

B0079XNWQA|5.0|This album put me in a really good place. The deluxe version includes some live songs along with a demo version of \\"I won't give up\\".  It's cool bcs you will hear a studio song then a live song and it gives you the feel that jason is chilling in your car with you while you're jamming to his tunes. he seems like a really chill guy and his theory on fading out and cross fading into different tracks when playing dj should be enough for the album to get 5 stars. A lot of the songs are up beat and have positive messages. this album won't be for everyone and some might say that it is too simple, corny, or poppy even, but when you listen to this album just try to key in on what he is saying, the melodies, and the up beat feel and you should enjoy it as much as I did. Def good for when you are feeling down and you need a pick me up or you are looking for a cruisin' cd if you feel me ;).
B004LWZW88|5.0|Picked this Blu-Ray up at Family Video for $10 and I am so glad I did. This is my new favorite animated film. It used to be Monster House and Toy Story 3 but step aside guys, Puss will cut you like liver if you don't. Cutest film ever!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele and this CD is fantastic!  I had purchased one over a year ago but either I misplaced it or it was borrowed and never returned.  That's probably what really happened; its so good they decided to keep it for themselves.  I reordered this recently and love, love, love her music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book to read. I dont usually read books twice, but this one i did. Good Price on Kindel, much cheeper than the book at the store.
0307120007|5.0|My 8.5 month old loves this book.  He anticipates every page and knows how to do all the motions and touches.  He laughs when he plays peek-a-boo with Paul and smiles after smelling the flowers.  He learned to wave from the last page.  Now whenever we say \\"wave bye bye\\", he waves just as he does to Paul and Judy.<br />This is a must have, all-time classic that really survived the test of time.<br />We love it and read it every morning.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Finally got this on Blu-Ray for $10 today at a video store that was closing. I loved this one, better than 2 by far and beats 3 to a pulp. Can't wait to see the new one in September!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read! The book is very well written and has a storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat and forces you to keep turning that page to find out what happens. The plot line is amazing. However the writing could stand to be improved. Though the plot is intended for older readers the book is written so that it could be understood by younger readers. All in all it's still a fantastic read.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|my mom n dad both have iphones n I don't and this app is one game I wanted to play against them n this game was never available 4 kindle fire n now it is.THX OMGOP!
B0073XORCY|1.0|Jethro Tull already did TAAB2 it was called A PASSION PLAY  and that was a thousand times better than this limp noodle.  Sorry Ian but you lost your enticing voice around WAR CHILD and TOO OLD TO ROCK&ROLL was the final straw. Since those days we've had Pearl Jam, Muse, and even alt-country singer Todd Snyder to tell us about the world. Sound quality and the muscianship of TAAB2 is alright but the lyrics and the vocals just plain suck. Come on Ian and put your ears above ground.
0670022950|5.0|Only occasionally, now, do I buy a physical book, much less a hardback, preferring instead to read on my iPad. The last was James Gleick's \\"The Information\\". But today I decided to add Steven Pinker's \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature\\" to my store of hardbacks. Its 800 page bulk and heft will go on the shelf next to my copy of Matt Ridley's \\"The Rational Optimist\\", within easy reach of my desk when I get too down on the World and need some reminder of why I should preserve my guarded optimism. Even though I have ti electronically, there is something about being able to pick it up and feel the weight of the evidence that strokes some lizard part of my brain. Oh, and Stephen Wolfram's book \\"A New Kind of Science\\" is on the other side of it. One could probably start a whole new movement or religion based on those three books.<br /><br />Pinker reminds us, with glorious scholarship and analysis, that this is the best time in the history of mankind to be alive, with the least to fear from nature-red-in-tooth-and-claw or the depredations of our fellow naked apes.<br /><br />The four better angels of our nature: empathy, self-control, moral sense, and reason are our best hope to extend the history of mankind beyond this century. I would add science to that, as an extension of reason.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game.  I would recommend it I love these types of games but this is one of the better ones
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Wow. I didn't think an app this inexpensive could remotely control a PC with this kind of clarity. I'm wonder if the HD version can be much better but I'm going to give it a try.  Maybe?
B006OFN0SE|2.0|My mom gave me this movie on DVD after she bought it; I generally can enjoy biographical movies, but this one just dragged on. It was interesting to see how the FBI was formed and the mindset of the organizer (disregarding Hollywood license, of course), but this movie could have been 90 minutes and been about right. A lot of the acting was a bit wooden for me.
B0079R8KXG|1.0|I really like Marware stuff, having ordered four of their cases previously (three for the iPad, one for the Kindle Fire), so why am I giving this one star? Because it's not red, it's pink. I think it's pink, my wife thinks it's pink...this is not a red case, despite what the photos show. And, yes, I know colours on a computer monitor never completely match up with real life. But when you take this case out of the package, your brain will say \\"PINK\\". I'm sending it back for a refund, never having even put it on the Kindle Fire I bought it for.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I don't always have the time to read the Bible, but with this I can listen to it when ever I want! It's fantastic. A true Christan would read or listen to this. It also works great on the Kindle Fire.
B003DT194G|5.0|Well, this is simply one of the best movies ever made. If you don't get this then I'm afraid you probably won't get anything. Sublime. And perhaps the best music score of all time too. I'd give it 200 stars if I could.
B005K17RU0|3.0|good weather and forecasts internationally.  nice maps even in Russia.  a pollen count and forecast internationally would earn this app 5 stars
B006C45CFG|3.0|Starts out with great suspense and Sci-Fi mystery, fizzles out in the second half. Strong cast attracted me to this movie, but not much of a story. Special effects looked good on SD on PC not great. Wish HD streaming to PC would be available ...
B007V2UGPE|3.0|the auto striking, auto choice of weapon just doesn't do it for me.  graphics are solid, gameplay is reasonable. am not a fan of games that basically play for you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it. The option to have it read to you is great. I got it because of the different versions available with this app. It is a must have app.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie is one of the greats and has so many great songs...this collection is a great variety of his hits and will remind you of how long and talented his career has been and continues to be.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Good game, combines several types of gameplay. lots of options, good graphics. plenty of store items, weapons, add-ons. doesn't ask for money all the time.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book is a great read and a fascinating lens on recent history. It also boasts links throughout to the extensive bibliography, some of which link to online transcripts and audio where you can listen to the actual presidential conversations. The index is linked back into the book too. It's much better than most ebooks.
B000GALEWC|5.0|The Metallica Black Album depicts a different style in contrast to its precedences. The black album presents a slower but heavy sound and lyrics which is unimaginatively good, as the band was able to create the same quality of awesomeness despite style changes.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Can't return back to homepage. Tried to press STUFF and GOALS, and still won't exit out. Those were the ONLY two options, I also had to shut down my kindle fire to return to homepage.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty out did him self he has a voice from heavy I loved I LOVE YOU THIS BIG made me think who i loved this big!!came down to my kids!! i played over and over the first day his music makes me smile bring it on scotty love your music !!!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Enough was written about the content. I rate it 2 stars for the quality of the kindle edition. The font just keeps changing size on you no matter what you do. It is very frustrating customizing the font size (almost) every new chapter. Something the production of the kindle edition is just wrong.
B000K3BZVU|5.0|Presence has shown the peak point of the band's creativity compared with all of their previous albums. Presence includes much of the same musical structure and tone with its predecessors, however, the album is still a magnificent piece of musical art. But it's definitely not Led Zeppelin's best.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|ebooks have completely changed how much I read. It used to be never but now I read almost daily. So much more convenient than carrying books around.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|I purchased this piece of crap and got it today(I bought it out of impulse to play some vinyls I had) and it sucks! Don't waste your money on it!! Even if it was only $10 you'd still be wasting your time and money on it!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app Soooo muchhhh! my username is LaurenLoves_<br />Please put instagram on the Amazon App Store! please! if there is anyway you can get instagram on here please do it :)
B00004Z3S2|5.0|Warning is indeed  a very underrated album in the Green Day's discography. It presents more of a poppy sound in contrast to its precedences, which contained faster and rougher sound. Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it's tremendously satisfying; it finds the band at a peak of songcraft and performance, doing it all without a trace of self-consciousness. It's the first great pure pop album of the new millennium.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|people keep saying they cant get out . go to options then the task bar comes up. it is really not that hard. over all a very good game when you know how to exit it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|best battery app ive tried alot of them<br />best overall<br />cool graphics<br />itsr a good app !  bh jvh h
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Give thanks to the almighty Jah this documentary is fascinating , very well done I was speechless and the story line is great I really enjoyed watching it I cant wait for the Dvd to be released so I can buy it<br />I'm just sad to see such positive man so vibrant and full of energy got his way cut up by cancer and has to leave us so soon but his spirit is alive and shall always be , my role model for sure<br />Rasta for sure man I recommend this documentary to anyone that like reggae music and jamaican culture and history
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The Beatles Mono Box contains much of the collector's items such as pictures, art, and 9 out of their 11 out of their studio albums, which were released in mono. The cds and box are made of high quality cardboard and plastics which add to the collector's value and its lifetime endurance.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It is the best game ever. I like the atmosfears. I like all the new birds. The ice bird is sweet.<br />  -Anthony
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Definitely a page-turner for readers. Though English is not my first lauguage, I really enjoyed reading this series of books. Very much looking forward to the author's novels in the future.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed book one and two more than three.  Half way through book three, I was ready for it to be over.  The book is well written and easy to read and although it is written as a young adult novel, all my friends are enjoying it and we are in our sixties!
B0011DK5AU|5.0|Led Zeppelin III proves the band's continued success and splendidness with much of its innovative sound and musical psychological effect on its listeners. Led Zeppelin III contains much folk and heavy rock with a different initiative. The Immigrant Song implies the band's success extends outside of their homeland into the other side of the world. Overall, Led Zeppelin III still remains one of my favorite albums.
B005S9EJZA|5.0|Look, the term is never used, but, speaking from personal experience after being at the wrong place at the wrong time on 9/11, I can tell you that PTSD is exactly what Zac Efron's character has gotten after deployment after deployment.  If you or someone you know has been deployed too much, or, you are just a fan of good love stories in general, GO SEE THIS!  There can be happy endings in films and in life for people going through PTSD.  I cried some big, fat tears for the first time in a long time at the movies.  It gave me hope.  The soundtrack is good, especially the song \\"The Story.\\"  The main characters all ultimately make healthy, emotionally mature choices.  Imagine that?!  It has a life-affirming message.  And, yes, it is smart and sexy.  For those of you out there who know someone going through PTSD or just challenges in life, this romance is cinematherapy you will actually enjoy!  Can't wait until it comes out on DVD!  I will pre-order now.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Is definitly one of the better games for the kindle fire. I have been playing this ever since i got it this afternoon. the only problem ive had is that when i exited the app, i tryed to get back in and it said sign in with a password, and i didnt even have one set. so i had to use a diffrent email. and before it did that, it would not tell me that it was my turn after my opponent took his turn. i dont know if anyone else has had that problem, but please fix this!!!!!!
B00756GKBA|5.0|I like this CD the more I listen to it.  I will always be a loyal fan of Madonna's because she does not let her fans down.  She continues to crank out the CDs, touring with great concerts, giving to charities, being a devoted mother....back to the CD.  It is bouncy, fun, funky, great club music.  I recommend it.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator 2 goes deeper into the story about Sarah Conner and the machine world, which reflects the overall quality of production to the movie. The blu-ray version is by far more realistic and clear than the DVD version. This version contains much special effects that look just unreal, considering it was shot back in the early 1990s.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|No instructions needed to start. A few \\"glitches\\" like sending uppercase letters. But highly recommended. Great to access my PC from my Kindle Fire.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love the new story fry me to the moon. Fry me to the moon was a runner up in a contest. the coming soon world is called UTOPIA(it was the winner!)
B004T4KQJS|1.0|I enjoyed this author at one time, with his may appearances on documentaries as well as his commentaries about the universe. In this book, I am not sure why there was such a mixture of religious dogma combined with  physics, but clearly he is an atheist and pushes this thought down your throat in several chapters. I reached a point i could not read any more after his repeated arguments that there is no reason for a God, that I threw the book away, and I will never desire to read anything more from this author.The issue is not whether he is right or wrong, but whether he has a right to argue against God on this pulpit of a book that you are thinking your reading something about physics. If he has the wherewithal to think he can speak to all of us or even argue that his subject about 'nothing' disproves God, then he should have titled the book appropriately. Because Lawrence cannot seem to decipher the difference between God and physics, I had a hard time determining the subject of this book.  For myself, this is a very distasteful exposition, and i never care to read anything more from this author as he has proved to me he is not really interested in educating me in his physics, but educating me in his wisdom about the universe as he sees it, including his disbelief in God. I'm done. Clearly there is 'nothing' here.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this app is good for when you are bored and traveling get this app really I never get bored please get this app
0893860220|5.0|This is it! The ultimate book on spirituality. You will never need another book as long as you live if you have found yourself attracted to this book. For me, this would be on par with the Bible or the Koran for a modern seeker: a book you can keep by your bedside for the rest of your life and dip into its wisdom at every point in your life. Or even better, a book you read once and never need any other book again!
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|1st I want to say that I loved this book. I could barely make myself put it down when I had to do other things like sleep. Sylvia Day has really wrote a book that I feel is really profound. It's the most real and raw look into these people's lives.<br /><br />I feel like they could be anyone that I know and that is what made me love it.<br /><br />I also loved the fact that it didn't shy away from the physical and emotional abuse that Gideon and Eva went through. Also, that they have the most honest relationship that I have every seen or read about. They are both upfront about the insecurities that they have and that is rare in fiction as well as life. I can't wait to see how this is going to play out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|keeps my interest passes the time kids love it too. like it a lot don't really know what else to say
B003YL4LYI|3.0|About halfway thru this thing and story focuses on Tyrion Lannister. Not much else. The whole series is losing steam for me, and has become more of guilty pleasure with all of the  plotting, scheming and TALKING! Toooooo much like a midevil soap opera. Very little action and plot progression with a final conclusion/confrontation in site. Hopefully HBO won't make the same mistake with their interpretation. Still like the premise and characters, but my interest is waning. I'm just along for the ride now on autopilot. No longer salivating for the next chapter. I think this book could have been summarized into four to six chapters. But like I said earlier: halfway thru. Mr. Martin sometimes has that trick with making his endings shocking, but satisfying cliff hangers.
B0073THBIK|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo kept me on the edge of my seat. This book was originally written in Swedish, so, obviously it has been translated, and at times this shows, but absolutely doesn't ruin the experience. I would recommend this book to anybody, even if you have seen the movie, this will only expand upon the movie.
B00563K38U|2.0|I rarely drop books. This was one was depressing read and after a while, I just could not finish this book. Since this was a book club book, I heard the reviews of the ladies in our group and they liked the book. Seems like the thing is to persevere.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Game is easy to use. The kids love it also. o e of the few games that leave one feeling g happy.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Well, I'm currently developing my farm which had \\"natural\\" gas service & I had planned on re-establishing it after demolition of an old structure & new construction of a home...  So glad I saw this before making a horrific mistake. This was a major wake-up call. My jaw is still hanging open. How can this be happening????????????????? Shameful. Watch this film and please pass it on to anyone you care about!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game! you should try it. cant stop playing it. i hope there are a lot of levels. it reminds me of old school mario.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am only on level 3 so I like it so far I think they could have done better on the game instead of making It just like Super Mario Bros.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on Rezound and Thunderbolt, worked great on OGDroid. I wish they would add some levels, plants, zombies, or something. I'd gladly pay for an update.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I am enjoying playing the game, but the one thing I hate about games like this is having to buy extra coins in order to have the extra good stuff. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for that!!!
B0041OOJNU|1.0|Major disappointment again from the world's greatest voice, I have to say that a couple of songs are not extremely bad (Sale el sol is tolerable), but the album overall is a pain to listen to, what a departure from \\"Pies Descalzos\\", where are you, the Shakira of 1996?!?!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun game with  many games. very challenging games with a twist. one of the most fun games I have ever played.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is cool.  *TROLLFACE*  XD ccccc ooooooo oooooooo.llllllllllll hhhgj chide fhkcb cjjg fhkf.  made up words.  I am the schwartz9 on youtube
B005529BDK|4.0|I like this game and the twist it offers on the standard match game. I would recommend this game. Nice graphics.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is super fun, and I play it all the time. my only complaint would be that it is super hard to get acorns. some missions require you to have acorns, but the only easy way to get them is to actually buy them with your credit card. so its fun, but when they say its free, it actually comes with a price.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been waiting for this app since like forever and now its finally here and it is even better on the kindle fire than iphone or ipod due to the greater amount of space we have to&hellip;Draw Something! ^.^
B006470HZ6|5.0|Love this series.  Great storyline.  Hope it stays on for a long time!  Reading the comics to the show I've never been dissapointed!
B007LPSLO4|5.0|This trilogy was the best I've ever read! I couldn't put them down. I loved Christian and Anastasia, and the way their relationship worked. I would love to read more about them. I also look forward to seeing more from the author! A DEFINITE must read!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE DIS APP! But da only thing I didn't like its dat it takes like forever so I cn visit someone else's villages...on the other hand...I LOVE IT!!! &lt;3
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game. I'm running it on a Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy series phone) with the Froyo build. It runs smoothly every time. Only two issues: long load times and my phone flips a lid if I receive a text or call while I'm playing but that's understandable with an app this size.<br /><br />I don't get the complaints about the wifi download. If you haven't downloaded it, don't rate it. The rating is for the app, not how you download it. If you did download it but still complained about HOW you downloaded it, you have bigger problems to worry about (maybe you're a zombie too).<br /><br />As I said before, my phone has the Froyo build. If your phone can't handle this game it may be time for a new phone, or maybe try closing some other apps first. It is a phone after all people, not a computer.<br /><br />P.S. The game really is a lot of fun. I've played it for hours and have almost all the achievements and still enjoy playing it. Highly recommended.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its a mario rip off but its a realy fun free game.<br />It even has a boss like bowser on mario.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|\\"John Carter\\" is an excellent film, full of amazing special effects, stunning landscapes, action and romance. Lynn Collins' performance is outstanding -- I hope we get to see her reprise the Dejah Thoris role in the future. In fact, the director and entire cast did a great job in bringing this story to the screen. Thanks to all involved in creating this entertaining and fun movie.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|A great but disturbing story that lingered with me for weeks.  Well written and thought provoking but again, that word disturbing
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The most groundbreaking, innovative, and entertaining television series of all-time.  William Shatner defines what it means to be a starship captain, and boldly takes us where not TV series has gone before. Nimoy as Spock is brilliant, and the rest of the crew has an undeniable chemistry that may never be duplicated again. A classic among classics.
B0037B6Q66|4.0|A great story, with interesting characters.<br />I read this book in one go on the plane and I couldn't put it down.<br />Lots of fun to read!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Omg. finally they have this game, ive bin waiting forever, now all they need to get is Temple Run! they have a lot of good games for the kindle but the best games are draw something and temple run!
B006ZVCQNM|5.0|After being booted from Sabbath in 1982, Ronnie James Dio came back with a roaring storm as a solo artist with Holy Diver. The album was a perfect slab of metal at it's finest, showing his old bandmates and rival Ozzy he could most definitely stand out on his own. For his next album, The Last in Line, he continued in the similar vein as Holy Diver. But for some reason, besides the 3 hit singles We Rock, the title track and Mystery, this album seems to be a bit underrated. It firmly holds up to the incredible debut, each song is a killer, with no filler. It is apparent in this album where Dio would go on to later in his career for the next few years, for a slight more accessible sound(IE 'Mystery), but still retaining his metal roots.<br /><br />So how does this Deluxe version hold up? Quite excellent in every sense. This blows the previous original 80's CD out of the water, right from the get-go of 'We Rock', it's a sonic bliss this album has needed for well over 20 years. The remastering is prestine, not overly compressed but a healthy, warm sound that bring out the best of each instrument. The bonus content is welcome for the collector and/or hardcore fans,from B-sdies to displaying Dio live at his height as a solo artist in the mid-80's. This version is highly recommened for hardcore fans or even ones who want a better sounding version, this deluxe edition does justice to Ronnie's legacy(R.I.P.). Here's hoping they do the same for Dream Evil, Lock Up The Wolves and Strange Highways(especially the awful-sounding original Dream Evil they shell out in bargain bins in almost every CD store). This Rocks!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great picture and lots of fun! the lil movie they show in the movie theater is also great and funny!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Finally! but now amozon needs to get temple run, its awesome! everyone wants temple run, so why don't they get it?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games series.  Easy to read.  I read them on a long road trip.  I could read a book in a day. Interesting characters in the books.  I highly recommend them. Enough romance but, not mushy. The stories kept my interest.  I also recommend the movie. I saw a the first movie and it followed the book exactly.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so much fun on kindle fire. I love how tlyou make your own village and how you have goals
