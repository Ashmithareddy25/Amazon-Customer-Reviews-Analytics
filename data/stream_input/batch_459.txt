B00005R1N3|5.0|I was reading \\"Cricket's\\" review and agree. I also saw this movie under the name \\"Stranger In The House\\". I have been looking for this movie, since I first saw it. This is truly one of the scariest movies out there. A true mind screw.  <br />It was on HBO the first night I saw it. I was babysitting my youngest brother, had all the lights turned out...when I noticed a flash of light upstairs, by the attic. Needless to say, my heart raced faster than a formula one car and found a baseball bat to clobber my would be attacker. I went upstairs slowly and as I got closer to the attic, the hall light flashed on again, scaring the everliving s**t out of me. When my parents came home, I found out that my Dad had put a new light switch in...the kind that flashes when it isn't completely shut off. <br />I was eighteen at the time and had never been that scared (before or since). The reason was because the movie made you think that it could happen. I still get the creeps thinking about that movie. Now that I have found this movie again, I'm not even sure I want to see it. It has stayed with me this long (I'm 44, at the time of this writing). <br />So if you truly want a scary movie, then this is the one to get. <br />Merry Christmas
0380778556|5.0|When is a romance novel not a romance novel?<br /><br />When it's a gothic suspense thriller fairy tale romance novel, such as Daphne duMaurier's Rebecca (Victor Gollancz, 1938, republished by Avon in 1971). The book's staying power can perhaps be best explained because it combines all the trashy, page-turning suspense of modern writers like Stephen King and John Grisham without the pedestrian prose that make King or Grisham such an insult to the intellect. Rebecca is well-crafted without requiring the same kind of concentration as a modern reader would employ when tackling the heightened language of older classics and it's fun without resorting to the formulaic styles of today's mass market paperbacks.<br /><br />The story is the first-person account of an awkward young maid who, while assisting her mistress on a vacation in Monte Carlo, falls in love with the dashing widower, Maxim DeWinter. Maxim marries her and whisks her off to his Cornish estate of Manderley, where the memory of his first wife, Rebecca, looms larger than life. While the shy narrator tries to fill the shoes of her sophisticated predecessor, Rebecca's presence haunts the foreboding mansion until the new, younger Mrs. DeWinter can find out exactly what became of Rebecca.<br /><br />For obvious reasons, Rebecca is considered an imitation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre - a haunting mansion with its own name ruled by a mysterious master with dark secrets about his first wife. But, stylistically, the two are very different. The poor little anonymous narrator of Rebecca lacks the strength and conviction of Jane Eyre's titular heroine. DuMaurier's is a darker novel than Bronte's and her protagonist's final victory is dubious, at best. While both novels have gothic elements, Jane Eyre strives for realism; Rebecca is a sinister fairy tale, with its melodrama and stilted, exaggerated characters. And, of course, Jane Eyre is Victorian.<br /><br />DuMaurier herself was shocked at Rebecca's popularity, saying she had written the novel merely as a study in human jealousy. But her readership saw it differently. First dramatized for radio by Orson Wells shortly after publication, then adapted for film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940, Rebecca remains duMaurier's best-known and best-loved work, trumping even her 1952 short story, The Birds, which was also made into a Hitchcock film and is more often associated with him than with its original author.<br /><br />What duMaurier didn't acknowledge is that this rags-to-riches Cinderella story may contain its own Oedipal influences. DuMaurier was born in London in 1907 to actor-manager Gerald duMaurier, the son of artist and writer, George duMaurier. Her mother a sophisticated socialite, the young Daphne was closer to her father and followed in the artistic footsteps of the paternal side of her family. In 1943, she married Major General Sir Frederick Browning, who had lost his beautiful and worldly fianc&eacute; in an unusual accident. The constant sense of competition between the narrator and Rebecca may reflect duMaurier's own feelings of inadequacy in loving men whose hearts were already given to women far above her.<br /><br />Beginning with her first novel, The Loving Spirit, published in 1928, duMaurier's work reflects her passion for Cornwall. Manderley is based on Milton, near Peterbrough where duMaurier visited as a girl, and Menabilly in Cornwall, where she eventually settled with her husband and raised three children. When Hitchcock filmed Rebecca, starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, du Maurier's only complaint was that he changed the setting to America, cutting out entirely her beloved Cornwall.<br /><br />In 1969, duMaurier was made dame for literary achievement, credited with writing the first gothic romance of the 20th century. She died on April 19, 1987. Two sequels were later published with the blessing of the duMaurier estate - Mrs. DeWinter, written by Susan Hill and published in 1993 by William Morrow and Company and Rebecca's Tale, written by Sally Beauman and published in 2001 by Little Brown.<br /><br />So what makes Rebecca a romance? This is not a tale of passionate embraces or the love at first sight of destined paramours. The emotions that are heightened are those of jealousy, inadequacy, and self-doubt. The narrator appeals to the gauche, insecure little girl in all of us who is given to flights of wild fancy and fears of improbable disaster. That we never know her Christian name underscores her subordination to Rebecca, whose name dominates the cover of the book as well as every corner of Manderley. It gives the sense that the narrator's life did not begin until her arrival at Manderley, at which time she gained the name of Mrs. DeWinter, albeit the second, of course. It also gives the reader a sense of intimacy with the narrator, as if, perhaps, we are a dear friend for whom repeating her own name would be redundant and unnecessary.<br /><br />But if it's not clearly a romance, it is thoroughly modern. Rebecca has no truly moral characters in spite of its melodrama. All its heroes are deeply flawed and face ethically ambiguous dilemmas. Its villains, if viewed in the proper light, may be sympathetic and we're given a chance to identify with the baddies. Nor is the ending clean and neat. From its opening line - one of the more well-known in modern literature - \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\", the narrator tells us that she is writing from a place of relative peace, but still running from what happened to her as a naive young bride. When the final revelation comes, 300 pages later, it's uncertain how the narrator will respond and, in fact, her response seems incongruous with the rest of her character (arguably the novel's only flaw). However, like the narrator, Manderley is a place readers will dream of returning to again and again.
1400032717|5.0|I read all kinds of books and some of them are enjoyable for awhile, but I can take them or leave them. This is one of those rare books that I REALLY couldn't put down. I was reading in the morning, with a timer set so I could stop in time to be ready for work. When the timer went off I had to reset it because I could not put it down. I cannot remember the last time this happened- I could just not let it go. I felt like I had entered Christopher's head. Reading this book also gave me some insight into autistic students who attend the school where I work.  I have not seen through the eyes of a person whose behavior is outside the norm like this since I read the Noonday Demon. I have recommended this book to everyone I have talked to since I finished it on Wednesday and I highly recommend this unusual and gripping story to you as well.

I think this album will really grow on me and become one of my favorites
0446677450|1.0|a friend of mine gave this book to me as a loaner. he said it was interesting and that i might learn a lot from it.  well sadly i did learn a lot about it.  i learned that by manipulating people into thinking they will make millions, you can sell a ton of books.   <br /> <br />this book is written TERRIBLY.  it has no flow, no sentence structure, honestly a 5th grade teacher would give this book an F if it was turned in as an english report. <br /> <br />he repeats himself 1000000000 times, and seems to be miling the pages to make it seem like the book has more content.   <br /> <br />honestly, his book can be summarized into the following points. <br />-Buy assets, not liabilities <br /> <br />-learn how money, and finances work <br /> <br />-school is a waste of time, dont bother to go unless you take accounting <br /> <br />-i am so great bow before me. <br /> <br /> <br />blech, i cant stand this book, please dont waste your money on this, it is like purchasing a liability instead of an asset!
B00005JMAH|3.0|Not bad, but not particularly great either. This is not TRUE fantasy. It's more like adventure. I have seen better villains too........perhaps some that I'VE had to create with my MASTER COMPUTER. If you want TRUE fantasy, watch \\"LEGEND OF EARTHSEA\\" on the Sci-Fi channel, or rent or buy \\"BIG FISH\\", or the \\"LORD OF THE RINGS\\" series. That's all I can think of right now that I can really recommend.Voldemort isn't even in this! The REAL villains are not all that good. BOTTOM LINE; If those critics call this film \\"more mature\\", then that's what they need to be. {Something else I'd recommend for good fantasy is \\"SLEEPY HOLLOW\\" or any other spectacular film by Tim Burton}.
0156907399|1.0|Just how do you write a \\"stream of conscious novel?\\"  It takes loads of talent to form words together precisely how one might think.  I first encountered this style reading James Joyce's \\"A Portrait of and Artist as a Young Man,\\" and later was amazed to see it perfected by William Faulkner in \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" I have to admit, this style of writing was starting to grow on me......that is until I read Woolfe's version of stream of conscious in \\"To the Lighthouse\\" which in my opinion is a failure of epic proportions.  What makes it an even greater failure is the fact that some people consider this one of the greatest books ever written.  To speak the honest truth, I can't remember I time when I have not enjoyed reading a book, as much as I didn't enjoy reading this one.    According to \\"expert\\" analysis, To the Lighthouse is supposed to use a mixture of symbolism in random thinking to show a portrait of characters that are searching for the meaning of life.  The actual Lighthouse is a different symbol to each individual character.    To the Lighthouse is also supposedly a dead on accurate view of gender roles and differences between men and women, and every character represents a different piece of this gender puzzle.  I have read what the \\"experts\\" say, but I will let you be the judge.    The novel does have an original way of telling its story.  It drifts from character to character without ever telling us when, and lets us know the thoughts they are thinking.  These vague thoughts tell a story as they are strung along.  I wish I could explain the plot, but there really isn't one.  The story opens at the Ramsey's vacation home where we learn mainly about Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, and their assortment of guests.  Guests like the painter, Lily, and the sexist Charles, and the dignified Mr. Banks.  The first half of the story brings us in and out of their minds.  Your mind will wander more than the writing style as you desperately try to grasp what the hell is goingon, and wondering if anybody really thinks like this in real life.  The thoughts of these characters are borderline absurd, and the most amazing aspect of all is that by the end of the novel I didn't know a single thing more about these characters than I did when it started.  All I know is the nonsense, abstract thoughts they think.  I don't know a thing about their beliefs or character.    The only one I felt I knew a thing about was Mr. Ramsey.  He wants others praise, and his son James wants to kill him.  What else?  Lily likes to paint....and Mrs. Ramsey likes to go to the market.  Oh, and at the end of the story Mr. Ramsey finally takes his son to the lighthouse, which never happened in part one.  Oh, we also learn that a few of the Ramsey's have died, in the \\"Time passes\\" sequence.  Not that we care, we didn't know any of them anyway.  Is this review helpful to you?  Does it make sense?  Probably not, but neither does a word of this novel.    This is without a doubt, the worst classic I have ever read.  Even with all the explanations.  I really want to meet the person who got something out of this mess and try to understand why in the world anyone would think it was great.  I don't get it.  I love stream of conscious books, but this one is a failure on a colossal scale.    If you like books about nothing, characters that are lifeless, books without plot, which are all about style and have no substance, than I think this might be the book for you.  I wish I could tell you more of what it was about, but it really isn't about anything.  I can picture a conversation I might have later in life about this novel and I think it might go something like this:  \\"So, did you ever read that book called To the Lighthouse?\\"  \\"I think so, I can't really recall.\\" (Myself)  \\"What was it about?\\"  \\"You know, I don't really know, I don't think it was about anything really.\\" (Myself)  It has been a day, and already these words ring true.  This book will be forgotten faster than mydinner I am eating at the moment is digested.    Grade: D+
B000069AUI|4.0|After the release of the first album in 2000 Parachutes, featuring the massive hit Yellow, Coldplay returned in 2002 with their follow up record, A Rush Of Blood To The Head. The result was this atmospheric record which drew comparisons to early Radiohead and U2. I think this record is well done and can be somewhat compared to Radiohead's The Bends album but not U2. The only weak tracks on this record are Daylight, which never really builds up during it's five minutes unlike the other five minute songs (Amsterdam, The Scientist and Politik) and A Whisper. Definetly one of the best albums from 2002 and is recommended to anyone who bought the first record or liked the radio singles.  <br /> <br />Top Five Tracks: The Scientist, Amsterdam, God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, In My Place, Clocks
0385504217|5.0|If this book accomplishes one thing and that is to make you THINK and RE-THINK and RE-THINK, then the book has succeeded in doing what I believe to be the author's intention from the beginning. The author's persipacity of truth is not in question here. Through thorough reseach and his own conclusion, the author decided to express HIS views and opinions through a story that was skillfully executed. No matter what your beliefs, I strongly recommend reading this book as well as 'Angels & Demons' the first of the Robert Langdon adventure.<br /><br />As one reviewer stated, I believe that some if not many of the religious values of the past no longer apply to today's world. The churces influence on society is waning. Gone are the days of a man in a pulpit preaching fire & brimstone with the congregation holding on to every word. Our society is becoming a spiritual society, no matter how hard that is to discern in today's world. Nevertheless, it's true. In my opinion, anyone of any faith who can cultivate hope, peace, love, understanding, compassion and faith in their hearts no matter what adversities they face in today's world is already a peaceful warrior of God.

B00005JN0T|4.0|There are several very good reviews already written on this movie, `I, Robot', most of which accurately point out the fact that, as the movie admits itself in the credits, is only loosely based on the collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov. I'm prompted to write a review of the DVD, because while all these reviews talk about the movie, none of them talk about the DVD.<br /><br />The most important thing about this package is that while it does not include a lot of special features a la `Matrix' and `Lord of the Rings' blockbusters, it does include my favorite feature, which is an alternate soundtrack containing commentary by the writer and the director. This single feature automatically doubles the value of the package as it gives an excellent reason to watch the movie a second time. I really prefer the alternate soundtrack approach to the captions commonly done with older movies, as there is typically much more information given and you can get much more from the intonation of the speakers than you can from the sterile text.<br /><br />That said, I believe the commentary soundtrack on this DVD is not as good as some of the best I have heard. My favorite is those by Kevin Smith, who has been known to supply two different commentary tracks and almost always has a symposium of three or four voices joining his own. A fairer comparison may be to the commentary track on Quentin Tarantino's special edition of `Pulp Fiction'. As both Smith and Tarantino are well known for including obscure `quotes' and references in their flicks, their commentary tracks are especially useful in revealing all the connections.<br /><br />As this movie is loosely based on a justly famous collection of short stories and liberally quotes from other Sci Fi classics such as `2001' and the 1930's Czech play `Rossum's Universal Robots (R.U.R)', this commentary track should be a goldmine, but it is not. While the speakers mention or allude to these references, they give very few concrete connections. I'm convinced that the actor who did the voice of `Sonny', the primary robot character took his queue from the voice of HAL in `2001', but the commentators give me no satisfaction. As the play R.U.R. is a much bigger source for the plot, I was a bit disappointed that this connection was not explored more fully.<br /><br />As there is a direct connection between Will Smith and Kevin Smith, as Will Smith had a cameo in Kevin's last movie, `Jersey Girl', I must point out that both Kevin Smith and the principles of `I, Robot' both have immense respect for Will Smith's talent as a professional movie actor in both courtesy to others and in his artistic contribution to the script and the quality of his improvisations on screen.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found the Susan Calvin character (played by Bridget Monaghan) to be almost entirely uninteresting. She would have been much stronger if she had been played as originally written by Asimov or closer to the Sean Young character in `Blade Runner', the movie I sense the authors were trying their darndest to match. They didn't even come close, primarily, I suspect due less to Will Smith's weakness than to the failure to match Ridley Scott's powerful world based on the great inventions of the original material's writer, Philip K. Dick. `I, Robot' had no hope of matching `Blade Runner', as the latter was much less an action / FX opus than a classic Sci Fi `what if' premise grafted seamless to a film noir atmosphere and imaginative Pacific Rim fusion Los Angles. The driving force of `Blade Runner' is the fact that the androids are designed to die after four years. Asimov's great invention of the three laws of robotics are useful as wallpaper, but do not, ultimately explain the action in the film. They are a red herring used by characters to doubt what is really going on. Oddly, while I found the acting behind the primary robot, `Sonny' to be very good, the writing for this character was very inconsistent. And, inconsistency is highly implausible in a computer-based life form. I was expecting something much closer to the character R. Daneel Olivaw from Asimov's two early robot detective novels, `The Naked Sun' and `The Caves of Steel', where the phobias of the principle human are much more consistent with the world posited by Asimov for the stories.<br /><br />This is certainly a worthwhile Sci Fi movie, although not in the class of `Blade Runner', `Minority Report', or even that great old classic `Forbidden Planet'. Good for a fun evening and a worthwhile second viewing with the commentary track., inconsistency is highly implausible in a computer-based life form.

B00005YW4H|5.0|It has everything--great singing and a beautiful, lush musical production. This is the break-out album that made Nora Jones a household name, where she swept the Grammy's her first time out. Without A doubt..a classic.
B00005Y23E|5.0|It's not just that Legend is the greatest collection of Reggae mustic ever assembled outside of Songs of Freedom; it's that Legend is one of the greatest collections of music period.  To say that this album is a \\"seminal reggae\\" album is as ignorant as saying that Jefferson Davis would have freed the slaves too.  It's seminal music, it is an example of the musical arts in its highest form.  This is what music is SUPPOSED to be (not merely Legend, the music Marley made in general).  I challange you to pick out a Bob Marley song, and Legend is merely (well, in brief atleast) of his music.  Teenaged American kids 30 years removed from the struggle, with zero comprehension of the fight still find amazing in this music, like Shakespeare it trascends time and steretypes to create something truly beauitful.

B00067BBQE|5.0|First off, Evanescence must be congradulated on such an awesome show and amazing cover art. Here's a run down of the concert, so people have an idea of what it sounds like.<BR>The CD starts off with an intro where all you can hear is the fans screaming, and the synthesizer humming in the backround.  The screams escalade, indicating the band has arrived, and sure enough a few chords are pounded out of the guitars and Haunted kicks off the set.<BR>The bands thunders their way straight into Going Under without pasing for a second, and Amy's voice scrapes the bottom of her range, growling hoarsely before ascending into her usual range. At the end of the song Amy thanks Paris and they move on to Taking Over Me, which is basicly the same version as on the album except with the middle of the song extended slightly. Everybody's Fool comes next, certainly not their greatest preformance, but definately worth hearing to hear Amy's obvius aggression.<BR>The band sweeps into a pano-lead cover of Korn's Thoughtless, which is pulled off beautifully and gives you a pumped feeling after listening to it. My Last Breath follows next, then Farther Away, an outtake from Fallen that many people will not have heard before. A great preformance, with an elongated begining and end, and an excellent mix of squealing guitars and tribal drums.<BR>The band slows down for the next two songs, starting with Breathe No More, another outtake. The live version involves the whole band, not just the piano as it was recorded. Some of the acostic guitar has a flamenco feel to it, just adding to the texture of the song. My Immortal follows, beautifully sung. Amy stops singing the chorus the first time through and the crowd is audible, singing along to the piano.<BR>The next song, Bring Me To Life, was the only song that I was disappointed with. It's sung out of key, and honestly I'm not a fan of John LeCompt's vocals, but there are good moments. The beginning of the song is mesmerizing, a slow piano introplaying as Amy sings saprano, the highest note almost sounding unhumane. From there it becomes steadily worse, but thankfully the band doesn't even pause before grinding into Tourniquet.<BR>During the string ending of the song, Amy announces that the next song will be their last. Imaginary is performed, with a solid ending instead of trailing off like on the CD, but otherwise the same version on Fallen.<BR>There's a long pause in the music and all that's heard is the fans' screaming for an encore. They get it, and the set wraps up with Whisper. Missing is included as an unreleased track, though it seems a little out of place after the loud live set.<BR>The DVD contains all sorts of extras, and anyone with even a mild sense of humour will be rolling around on the flor laughing. All together this is an excellent CD/DVD package to have for any fan of Evanescence.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Never was a Slipknot fan due to the fact that I was such a huge Mushroomhead fan, and felt that listening to both would be a sin.  When I heard Duality on the radio I decided to pick up the disc.  That was in May of 04, and it has never left my cd rotation.  Following this I purchased their previous discs (self titled and Iowa) and found them enjoyable, but nothing comes close to this disc.  A much more mature album than their first, and a not so balls to the wall heavy album as Iowa.  The songs are intelligent and dark, the guitar riffs are extraordinary, and the drumming is unbelievable.  Slipknot has truly made the best album of 2004, and you can thank alot of that to the genius of Rick Rubin bringing out the best in these musicians.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|For all you people who think Slipknot is garbage and that their music is just noise or whatever you're complaining about, it's pretty simple: If you don't like Slipknot then don't buy their friggin CDs or listen to their music! Jeez if you don't like the music then don't complain on and on about it, you're not helping, contributing or changing anything! Shut up and listen to whatever mainstream crap they're playing on MTV instead of critizicing something. Maybe you don't like this kind of music because YOU DON'T LISTEN TO IT. Maybe if you were a true metal head then you could probaly appreciate it instead of comparing it to god knows what, good charlotte or something. Crawl out of your hole and go find something that's worth arguing over instead of beating a dead horse, we all know you think they suck and really nobody cares. Get a life.

B0000019PA|5.0|This album is the reason we're all sorry Jeff Mangum stopped making music. Well, stopped making pop music, anyway. This album is a quirky meditation on sex, death, and Anne Frank, and it sounds like your standard four-piece pop ensemble bedded down with a Salvation Army band (remember Rainy Day Women, kids?) and woke up a week later expecting, well, this. <br /> <br />This isn't just a great album; it's also unexpected. Like the way Revolver came after Rubber Soul, or Nevermind after Bleach. There's very little in On Avery Island that anticipates the feel of this album, yet they seem somehow to be of a piece. <br /> <br />I would have loved to have been at the meeting at Merge where Mac and company got to hear this for the first time. It's just so totally different. In a good way. <br /> <br />Also, if you get a chance to hear any tapes or MP3s from the tour supporting this album, hear them. They've really got that \\"a whole lot more, but not for a whole lot longer\\" feel to them. <br /> <br />Buy. Enjoy. Or not. You can sell this baby back for most of what you paid for it. Honest.
B0000039PW|5.0|Great production from the Bad Boy camp. You can tell this album was heavily influenced by Dr Dre's The Chronic album. You know you have a great album when the best songs aren't the hit singles. The centerpiece of the album is \\"Me & My Bitch\\"
B000268QB2|5.0|When I bought this CD I didn't know what I should wait for. I had heard 'Somewhere only we know' several times and I thought I had to check out that band. The first time I heard the CD, I was really surprised, I hadn't seen a band with such quality, perfection, and enthusiasm in a long time. Chaplin's voice works in a perfect synchronization with Tim's piano and Richard's drums to create a simple, yet unique and astounding sound. ''Hopes and Fears'' is a masterpiece composed by awesome and beautiful songs such as ''Everybody's changing'', ''This is the last time'', ''Bedshaped'' and ''I can't stop now'' makes this album one of my favorites ever. That's why I give it 5 stars.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The Day After Tomorrow is an exciting movie with a throwaway plot, but it has some of the best special effects in recent movie history.  At an United Nations Conference, climatologist Jack Hall states that in as few as a hundred or as many as a thousand years, global warming will be begin to change the Earth's climate in drastic ways.  No one pays much heed to his warning.  Only weeks later, the severe climate changes come much sooner than Hall expected, plunging the world into another Ice Age.  When Hall discovers his son is trapped in New York, he decides to march from Washington DC to NY to rescue him along with two close friends.  If you couldn't tell, the plot is more than a little predictable, but that is beside the point.  What makes this movie worthwhile are the extraordinary special effects, whether it be countless tornadoes ravaging dowtown Los Angeles or a huge tsunami-like wave flooding the streets of New York City.  Equally impressive are the shots from the space shuttle orbitting Earth of the changing face of the planet as the ice moves farther and farther south.  Don't buy this movie for the story, get it for the amazing special effects. <br /> <br />  Dennis Quaid stars as climatologist Jack Hall, a scientist who must travel to New York to save his son.  Even though the science in the movie is pretty far-fetched, Quaid makes it believable when he tries to explain what is happening all over the world.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jack's son, Sam, who must try to survive in the Public Library with a small group of survivors.  Ian Holm stars as Terry Rapson, a scientist working in Scotland who believes and supports what Hall is trying to explain to the world.  Sela Ward plays Jack's wife Lucy, a doctor trying to save a young cancer patient.  The movie also stars Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, Jay O. Sanders, Austin Nichols, Arjay Smith, and Tamyln Tomita.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, two different commentary tracks, two deleted scenes, plenty of CD-ROM offers, and sound demos for eight scenes.  For an exciting disaster flick with a good cast and impressive special effects, check out The Day After Tomorrow!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth step was the first APC album i bought, and i was sort of skeptical about how good it was going to be. The only reason i bought it was because i heard Keenan was singing, and i will buy anything that he sings in. I was expecting something similar to Tool, which is my favourite band, but what i got was a very deep album, sort of like Keenans quieter side. But ill get to reviewing the songs <br /> <br />The Package-Best opener, Keenan shows off his wide arange of vocals. Excelent drumming too, not too fancy but awesome-10/10 <br /> <br />Weak And Powerless-There biggest mainstream song. One of the louder songs. Not one of my favourites on the album, but that may be due to overplaying.8/10 <br /> <br />The Noose-This one blows my mind everytime, i didnt like it too much, but it grew on me. I cant get enough of this song. 12/10 <br /> <br />Blue-Again, if anybody but Keenan was singing this it would be average. Awesome lyrics, Maynard really shines.9/10 <br /> <br />Vanishing-One of those songs that takes awhile to get into, i skipped it for the first couple times, but i really like it now. Its pretty much indescribable.9/10 <br /> <br />A Stranger-I really like the intro, its one of the different songs on the album, very strong song.9/10 <br /> <br />The Outsider-Another commercially succesfull song, excelent beat, chourus is awesome, everything about this song is awesome.11/10 <br /> <br />Crimes-Never listened to this song much, still good, but not an outstanding track. 7/10 <br /> <br />The Nurse Who Loved Me-This one took a realllllly long time for me to get into, very different, but i really like it now. Extremely soft song.9/10 <br /> <br />Pet-Im not too fond of the intro, but past that its an incredible song. Awesome Lyrics. Check out the remix to this song on Emotive called \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep To The Rythm Of The War Drum\\".10/10 <br /> <br />Lullaby-The only filler track on the album. not bad as far as filler goes. Im gonna rate this one as afiller, not a real song.9/10 <br /> <br />Gravity-Awesome song right from the intro to the very end. Lyrics are great. 11/10 <br /> <br />Total Rating-114/120 <br /> <br />If your lookin for a copy of tool your not gonna find it here, but if your looking for an awesome cd for your collection, this would be a good choice. <br /> <br />Note:This cd has copy protect, and may not load onto some mp3 players
B00019PDKC|5.0|I have been an anathema fan for a while now.  I like their slow, emotional, melodic songs the best.   <br /> <br />When I first heard this CD I thought a few of the songs were really cheesy.  I still sorta feel that way, as Vinnie continues to experiment with his vocals.  These songs are pretty sparse and his voice gets annoying sometimes.  Danny's vocals on the other hand, are awesome.  I really wish he would sing on more tracks. <br /> <br />That said, I can't believe that no other reviewers wrote about how incredible the title track is.  It is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  And that is really saying a lot. <br /> <br />It is a repetetive song but the melody is gorgeous.  It is dark, emotional, moving, and depressing all at the same time.  If you enjoy exploring these emotions, then buy this album.  I am not sure what the song is about, but I would venture a guess that it's about their deceased mother, who they also dedicated \\"one last goodbye\\" to. <br /> <br />That said, tracks #2 and #3 are awesome as well.  They could really be the same song, because track 3 flows out of track 2.  It is like an extension of track 2.   <br /> <br />Overall, I think this album has more misses than albums like judgement or alternative 4.  But it is still awesome.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I understand that many of the more traditionalist rock types don't see LP has a good band.  They still like the old days of AC-DC, Metallica, Pink Floyd and bands of this nature.  I like those groups too, but what you need to understand is that LP is a good band.  Their teaming up with Jay-Z doesn't destroy credibility and isn't selling out, teaming up with him is one of the ways to expand music as a whole and shows that Lp and other bands who do similar things don't want to be confined to one label.  I like rap, rock, nu-metal, all sorts of music and you need to understand that while LP is not the Pink Floyd of their generation they are a very capable band that is willing to try new things.  You also must realize that it's not just punks and people who shop at hot topic who like LP.  I would be what you consider an athelete prep and i like LP and so do many of my friends.  My two 50 year old uncles who  grew up with all the old rock bands like LP.  LP deserves a shot and they are making the most of it.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, and I was definitely NOT disappointed with this.  I bought one for myself and for a good friend of mine, who is a MJ Fanatic!!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B000055Y0X|4.0|There's little I can add to the glowing reviews of this movie that have already been posted.  It really is a classic, hilarious in a very dark way, and eminently watchable 40 years after it was made.  Rating the movie, as a movie, I'd give it 5 stars without hesitation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the print they used to make the DVD - I have the Special Edition, not the 40th Anniversary set - is less than perfect. There are lots of little speckles and flecks that are clearly on the print and not the result of digitizing the images. You'd think they would have either found a better print or cleaned up the one they used; it's not hard to do cleanup on a black-and-white print.<br /><br />That said, the photography is often great. The close-ups of Sterling Hayden are masterful, and the War Room appears totally real.  The only place where it's obvious that they're using composite shots is when you see the B-52 flying over the Arctic landscape.<br /><br />So, while I love this movie, I have to dock it a point for the poor print. If I could give this DVD 4.5 stars I would, but there's no provision for that.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This is not only one of Paul Simons best albums, it's also one of the best albums ever made.  I listen to it often and find it rare to have an album that every song is great.  Highly recommend it.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|For the record, my son Fred Scott, was born in Stockholm, Sweden on that day in 1985 when all the world was watching the biggest extravaganza in rock history. Since then the child has become a man, well 19 anyway, and has his own rock band in Norfolk, Va. Although he's a student at Old Dominion University, he finds the time to play his music. He says he really digs The Police and U2. So the DVD is something of a thrill for him to watch his idols in their past glory.  <br /> <br />Watching the DVD I am reminded of the emotion I felt that when on arriving homne a few hours after his birth at 2 pm (Stockholm),The Cars were singing \\"I want to drive you home.\\" The producers put on scenes simultaneously from Ethiopia showing emaciated mothers digging holes in the ground with sticks to bury their dead fly covered babies who had died of starvation. I compared my own child with those poor dead infants who never had a chance, and broke into tears of remorse for such tragedy. This DVD is a wonderful reminder of the fact that the plight of so many people still plagues us and that it is up to all of us to try to relieve the unbearable suffering of the millions who are slowly starving or dying of other malignant causes. Buy the DVD, rock on and remember the unfortunate. We can help. All of us.
0441172717|5.0|As well as being one of the best selling science fiction novels of all time, Dune is arguably the best science fiction novel ever written. Certainly, the planet Dune is the most fascinating planet I've ever seen created in a science fiction novel. <br /> <br />Set 8,000 years in the future, Dune tells the story of the planet Arrakis (known as Dune to its inhabitants). Arrakis is unique in the known universe. It is a planet covered by vast desert terrain and is one of the harshest environments ever encountered by man. Strange creatures inhabit the desert, the most unique being the giant sandworms that live beneath the sand and viciously guard the deposits of Melange on the planet's surface. Melange is a spice, found only on Arrakis, that has many special properties. Extremely addictive, it prolongs the life of those who consume it regularly. It is also used by navigators of the spacing guild to allow them to \\"see the future\\" and thereby plot a safe passage through \\"foldspace\\" to enable huge starships to traverse the heavens. Without Melange, the galaxy would have no space travel and would fall back into a barbaric existence. <br /> <br />The Emperor Shaddam IV rules the Galactic Empire. Controlling an empire of one million inhabited worlds, Shaddam must keep peace between the Great Houses (ruling families) of the galaxy. The currency of the empire is Melange since it is so vital to space travel. Shaddam has allowed the Harkonnens (one of the Great Houses) to rule over Arrakis for the past 80 years. Their only mission has been to ensure a steady flow of Melange to the Empire and the spacing guild. Without the spice, the Empire would surely crumble as space travel ground to a halt and millions of people addicted to Melange died. <br /> <br />A secretive society of women called the Bene Gesserit, also use Melange to allow their \\"reverend mothers\\" to see into the future. However, only females have been able to use the Melange to achieve this forecasting ability. For somereason, there are pieces of the future that women are unable to look into. Therefore, the Bene Gesserit have spent centuries working on a genetic breeding program whose aim is to produce the \\" Kwisatz Haderach\\". The Kwisatz Haderach (or messiah) would be a male Bene Gesserit whose mental powers would be able to bridge space and time and avoid the limitations suffered by the female Bene Gesserit. <br /> <br />As the story begins, control of Arrakis is being handed over to House Atreides, the bitter enemies of the Harkonnens. Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides, is supposed to be one generation removed from the Kwisatz Haderach. However, his mother Jessica (a Bene Gesserit) has hopes for him to become the long sought after messiah. But first, House Atreides must fend off the evil machinations of the Harkonnens and enlist the help of the mysterious Fremen (native inhabitants of Dune). Failure to do so will certainly result in the ultimate destruction of House Atreides. <br /> <br />Herbert's story is very engaging. He plumbs the depths of political intrigue in a society that while advanced, manages to get along quite well without computers. The infighting amongst the Emperor and the Great Houses is reminiscent of medieval Europe and makes for a very interesting plot. However, the most fascinating parts of the book revolve around the ecology of the planet Arrakis and the struggles of the Fremen to exist in such a harsh environment. As you would expect, moisture is very precious on a desert planet and Herbert was very inventive in the devices and behaviors he created for the Fremen to conserve the body's precious water. I've read this book at least many times and I enjoy it more each time I read it. <br /> <br />Herbert wrote five sequels to Dune. Alas, they are all seriously inferior to the original novel. But nevertheless, Dune is a must read for all science fiction fans.
B0001I55SS|4.0|How's this for a blasphemous statement:  I enjoy the post-Star Wars ripoffs much more than Star Wars.  This could be coz I always favor the low budget underdogs to the big budget FX extravaganzas.  Or maybe it's just coz I have a loathing for George Lucas, the Gene Simmons of sci-fi.  Maybe I like robots played by human actors in plastic costumes or those cool looking trash can robots that dominated 70s sci-fi.  Either way you cut it, I like the Black Hole.  But make no mistake about it, The Black Hole is anything but low budget-it's actually groundbreaking in terms of visual effects.  The thing is, The Black Hole plays out like a cheesy 50s sci-fi flick regardless of the budget.  Plus, this film gives us Robert Forster, Anthony Perkins, Ernest Borgnine and Roddy McDowell.  McDowell provides the voice of a cute trash can robot(no corporation would EVER make a robot this silly looking) who's actually quite a little [...] kicker.  Perkins is still slightly in Norman Bates mode as a  traitor scientist.  Borgnine is a whiny schmuck.  Forster does his usual wooden, badazz performance as the hero.  He has a tendency to compliment any crew member who takes out an evil robot with comments like, \\"Good shot\\" and \\"Way to go, Bob\\".  Here's my quick rundown:  Forster and crew discover a spaceship missing for 20 years.  It's resting comfortably on the edge of the biggest black hole in the universe.  Once aboard, they meet Maximillian Schell who's a wacky scientist hell bent on taking his ship into the black hole, through and beyond!  He's slaughtered his crew and made them all robots(a process that consists of wrapping the head in tinfoil and electrocuting the person), and is guarded at all times by a creepy looking robot named Maximillian.  Perkins wants to join Schell, but Forster ain't having it, so the battle begins.  Forster'll be damned before he's used as a guinea pig(though he becomes one anyway).  Lots of laser shootouts with the evil robots(complete with trademark laser shooting sound) and running around.  Not quite on the epic level of something like Star Wars or 2001.  I think alot of people hate this coz they compare it to Star Wars and expect alot from Disney.  I think the movie's pretty darn fun to watch myself.  Sci-fi movies from this time period are just a blast.  I'd suggest that instead of watching this with Star Wars type expectations, it's more realistic to watch it with Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers type expectations.  It may have a larger budget than those two films, but the feel is the same.  Dig it.shooting sound) and running around.  Not quite on the epic level of something like Star Wars or 2001.

0812550706|5.0|The Buggers, insect-like aliens from another galaxy, had attacked Earth twice. The Buggers were only narrowly defeated the second time. To forestall an inevitable third attack, Earth has sent an invasion fleet towards the bugger home worlds, hoping to surprise them in their own territory. The journey across the galaxy will take 50 years. Now all that Earth needs is someone to command the forces and defeat the Buggers. <br /> <br />Towards that end, trained personnel monitor young children. The ones that show promising command traits are sent to battle school. At battle school the children are pitted against each other to see which ones could possibly be developed into future leaders. <br /> <br />Ender Wiggin is a mere six years old. His older siblings, Peter and Valentine had shown great promise and therefore his parents were encouraged to have a third child (Ender). Peter and Valentine were rejected from the program but Ender was accepted and sent to battle school. Less than 10 years remain before the Earth fleet reaches bugger space. The teachers at the battle school must use every possible tactic at their disposal to mold Ender into the supreme commander...even at the risk of Ender's sanity. For Ender Wiggin represents Earth's last, best hope for survival. <br /> <br />This story is reminiscent of Starship Troopers by Heinlein, although it is presented from a different perspective. In Starship Troopers, the story is told from the perspective of an infantry soldier sent to fight insect-like aliens. Here, the action focuses on the training of the leaders of our forces instead of on the common foot soldier.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Holy bong hits! I've been a fan of metal for a long time now. I've heard all combinations of metal fused to make either religiuosly great music or dog doo. Lamb of God...jeez, I don't even know where to start. Basically these guys kicked ass from day one. \\"New American Gospel\\" was my american gospel. This fusion of metalcore/thrash/math-tech music is blistering. I love the production on \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" beacuse it fits so well. But when I put \\"Ashes of the Wake\\", I'm pretty sure I soiled myself. The production on this thing is crazy clean! Every blistering riff and drum beat is clearly audible. It's not murky whatsoever. Vocal mix...again, soiled the undergarmets. Randy's vox (as many have already stated)induce instant creamage. He produces the gutteral followed the thin screech and it's oh so dirty! Both productions are great for the respective albums and they each work with the musicality being presented at the time. The same, but different. They still math-it-up but keep it fresh also. Metalcore fans...well, you guys probably own this by now since LOG has swept the nation, but fans of heavy music should check this out. Prepare to be soiled.
B000066744|5.0|Oh my god!! This brilliant masterpiece of cinema genius awoke and stirred every emotion in every fiber of my body!! I consider myself to be of a tougher mentality when it comes to sentimental type movies; however, I found myself with a lump in my throat, and tears in my eyes at the end of this cinematic symphony! We can all learn alot from the character 1900, especially in today's chaotic, stress filled society. I thought it was brilliant how he derived his music via visual interpretation of one's demeanor or mood, thus providing him with infinite unique musical masterpieces. He painted musical Michelangelo's on a keyboard and was more than content to remain on a ship, confined within it's walls for his entire life. He valued the quality of his life over the quantity, and in that respect he lived a thousand lifetimes. WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY!! I especially like the scene where he is challenged to a \\"Piano Duel.\\" I am now more than ever, a Tim Roth fan.
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic is Bjork's third studio attempt and worthy of huge praise. Here she loses many of her crowd-pleasing (but still amazingly unique) techniques of approach and takes a huge step into venturing into the beautiful eccentricities she flirts with in her later albums. The darkness of this album encompasses you and causes a strangely wholesome feeling that goes hand in hand with love. You feel trapped and you don't want to leave this void that is the hauntingly beatiful soul of Bjork. For truly, this is Bjork's soul. What is captivating is Bjork does not limit herself to words. Words cannot even scratch the surface of the emotions Bjork expresses in her music. The \\"screams\\" she uses to inflect meaning make just as much sense as the simplest sentences. It is a deeper understanding than can be explained, yet is so easily understood. <br /> <br />Well, moving on to Homogenic. As I said before, Bjork is really moving away from what would generally be accepted by the mass public with this album. It opens with the mysterious \\"Hunter\\" that brings you to huge heights and back down to this controlled, leveled environment. It seems to inflect the inner-animal that is within humans, but not easily admitted. Truly, at the primal level, we are all animals. The strings are shocking and remind me of any predator lurking for prey. It moves into the well-known \\"Joga\\" which is a wonderful tribute and explanation of her love for her home, Iceland. \\"Unravel\\" makes me think of the undying love for someone that distance cannot decay. \\"Bachelorette\\" is Bjorks epic, no doubt about it. The anger, the sadness, the trauma.... I find this astonishing song to be angrier than anything Cannibal Corpse or Slipknot could create. There is no doubt those bands feel passionately, but this is completely raw and obviously a freshly-made wound. It seems sporadic, almost as if Bjork is writing a letter, each word calculated immediately in her mind. The strings are amazing, there is no doubt. The end is the result of pain that explodes: there are no more words. I dare any artist, talented or not, to rival the passion of \\"Bachelorette\\". <br /> <br />As well as \\"Bachelorette\\", another standout includes \\"5 Years\\". Most have a problem with it because of the rather \\"simplistic\\" beginning in comparison to most of the other tracks, but it is an amazing effect and causes the listener to be completely swept with her infectious deliverance. Personally, it is my favorite song of Bjork's, period. I cannot place a second or third, but THIS song is for sure my favorite. The effects are used to escalade to a climactic moment that lasts longer than most and only grows and grows as the song progresses. Strings are brought in towards the middle and copy the oringinal, \\"simplistic\\" melody which is a truly awesome experience. \\"Pluto\\" sums up all of her hurt and feelings of angst. Although the music is very danceable, I would never dance to this track. You just can't take the pain that is being portrayed in the jerky rhythms of this song and make any light of it. <br /> <br />Homogenic ends on the beautiful \\"All is Full of Love\\". Personally, I enjoy this version over the single remix. The initial few sounds of the song give off the impression of heavy breathing and push you into a very intimate and sensual space of listening. Bjork's voice moves from speaker to speaker as she announces to all that \\"all is full of love\\" and you just aren't realizing that it is around you. I find it to be really inspirational when you feel alone. It reminds you that there is always someone who cares about you, you just aren't realizing it. <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of metal and hardcore punk: ranging from Marilyn Manson and Morbid Angel to The Distillers and Rise Against. I will never, ever deny my attachment to Bjork and her music, it is something I always feel proud about. She is delicate and sings of lost love and sensuality, and is generally not associated with the antics of modern rock and a \\"masculine\\" reputation. Well, Bjork put aside what society accepts as \\"a good singer\\" and \\"good music\\" to become who she is, an amazing singer who creates amazing music, and I choose to follow her lead. Bjork doesn't belong in a genre, she is who she is and never compromises that. She never compromises herself for record sales, and that is not something that many artists can relate to. To anyone looking to delve into Bjork, always have an open mind and don't evaluate her music as it is on the surface, for it goes much, much deeper than that. And to those of whom have been fans for some time, I hope you can only sympathize with my feelings.
0792164903|3.0|Taken after Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, this movie is so-o-o Tim Burton that it is pathetic. It takes the viewer for a ride on the dark side of the turn of the 19th century and frightens the viewer out of his wits. Christopher Walken plays his part to a FAULT. And, both Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are convincing in their roles. Believe me, Depp is better at being a Scotland Yard Inspector, than he is at being Willa Wonka! Here's a suspense-filled movie that leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat until the very shocking end!
B0002Y69NG|4.0|A lot of people who trash this movie in their reviews are missing the inportant symbolism of it.  The \\"matrix\\" symbolizes the oppressive fundamentalist culture that is taking over in this country, until homosexuals, like the hero \\"Neo\\" are forced into \\"underground\\" societies like the one in the film.  Neo fights bravely against the \\"Agent Smith\\" chaacter, an amalgam of every right-wing bigot and named after Bob Smith University, famous for its puritanical teachings.  Neo perseveres with his young boyish lover \\"Trinity,\\" a young transvestite who struggles with Neo against the crushing weight of ignorance symbolized by the ghosts and monsters that form the \\"matrix\\" of bigotry.  This is a highly unusual treatment of homosexual issues, but it's a refreshing change.  It's also the answer to the unasked question: \\"How do you get homosexuals to a science fiction  hovie?\\"  From the legion of devoted fans, I think it's clear we have the answer.
0694003611|5.0|This book is very adorable. I read it all the time to the kids I babysit, and it always puts them fast asleep. I remeber when I was little even I loved the book and had memorized it. The book really is adorable, so if you've got little kids around, DEFINITLEY read them this book.
B00064X3FE|5.0|When you listen to this CD, there is raw truth and emotion in every song.  The rags to riches story of two best friends who started out as strangers, and became one of the biggest sensations to ever hit pop culture.  The openess of these songs is amazing.  It's all here.  Every emotion, argument, weakness and strength.  What you see is what you get with this CD.  Nothing is held back, and the music is the best Elton and Bernie have ever made!  If you think you know Elton John and Bernie Taupin......  You never will until you listen to this CD!  Buy it!  You won't regret it!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The album is London Calling. The year is 1979. And with the album's release, the rock world will forever be changed. Now, London Calling is possibly the best album ever made, and the Clash have turned into the best rock and roll band in history. There's no doubt. With the most fun an album has ever given, the pre-punk album London Calling is the best album released in Britain. If you have not already given The Clash a try, you sadden me. You don't know what you are missing. Every song on London Calling is a miracle, and each is turned in and out with fun, Lost in the Supermarket being a prime example. But the biggest point made by the album is how every song is different. From lounge music on Jimmy Jazz to a song about impending war on the title track, the album is very self-conscious, and it almost knows how good it is. Well, the rest of the world does too.
B000001Y42|2.0|When I first heard this album I couldn't stand it too tell you the truth. At the time I as listening more to ICP because they rap very intelligent lyrics unlike Durst. Overtime I gave it a few more listens and was surprised by the outcome I actually enjoyed it so much I kept on listening to it for hours. Finally 3 weeks later I came to the conclusion that this was indeed the band that revolutionized the true essence of metal not all that death, grindcore, thrash,progressive/power, black metal garbage. after a lot of thought some friends and I decided to make a tribute band to Limp Bizkit and i think they truly deserve a tribute band knowing as how much effort they put into making a masterpiece like this along with Results May Vary which was another compelling album full of great musicianship by Durst and Borland who just takes out Mustaine at guitar so bad anyways pick up this album if you see it on the clearance rack at any music store you won't be dissappointed
0452282152|5.0|What a lovely story surrounded by the story of the painter Vermeer and his enchanting Dutch \\"Mona Lisa\\".  I found this story particularly enjoyable because of my love of all things Dutch.  The author is able to perfectly blend a lovely fictional character coming-of-age with factual history from the life and town of Johannes Vermeer.  The author did an amazing job exploring the rift between the catholics and protestants within the community.   <br /> <br />Also, see the movie after you read the book...Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson portray Vermeer and Griet well, and the scenery of Delft, Netherlands is breathtaking.   <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|OK, when Roger took over, the sound might have not have been Pink Floyd, but there was some classic Floyd here, admit it.  I'm not saying that the Final Cut was a good album, I'm just saying that this isn't as bad as almost all floyd fans say, infact...IT ROCKS!!!!!!! It starts with a Pink Floyd show (Pink Floyd is the fictional character in this story), then it goes back to his birth (baby crying). It then kicks into his childhood problems, Dad dieing in war, abusive schoolmasters, overprotective mother, unable to deal with young lust. Then, his gilrfriend leaves him, and the pain of being alone is the last straw, and Pink Floyd goes insane. Then, on disc 2, Pink Floyd reaches out to the troubled youth in his music and becomes a successful rock star with lots of pride, but his paining memories still haunt him. Then, he uses drugs to calm himself, but thinks get out of line at his concert, the same concert where our story begins. Then, he realizes it needs to stop, and after a trial in his mind, it ends and he goes outside the wall. Oh, i forgot, the wall is an imaginary thing that isolates pink floyd from the rest of the world. <br />As for the music, Rockin', \\"In the Flesh?\\" is 1 of those songs, not nearly heard enough. \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" is a classic & an anthem for anyone who hates school.  ok, i don't feel like going thru the rest of the songs, but trust me they're good, and i know some songs seem like filler, but it's only to contribute to the story.
0671027387|5.0|I have enjoyed every one of Dan Brown's books. (yes I have read everyone as guilty pleasures)<br /><br />The mystery, suspense, and intellectual/scientific ideas are a thrill...I always love the codes and code-breaking.  this book is a real \\"page-turner.\\"<br /><br />Don't expect Proust or Steinbeck, but if you want a fun, quick read that you will certainly enjoy, pick up a copy of \\"Deception Point...its a very \\"deceiving\\" story in multiple ways..you wont regret taking two or three hours to read it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I might be wrong, but this seems like the first really good album since Nevermind. The only difference is, this time, there was much more jams, and much more creativity. There are so many good songs on this album.  \\"Cherub Rock\\" is always a favorite, it's got so much power and raw energy. \\"Today\\" is a classic, from it's opening guitar to it's fade away. \\"Hummer\\" is one of my favorites. I just love that jam session.  \\"Disarm\\" is a masterpiece. Great, in every respect. \\"Geek U.S.A\\", is my favorite, IT ROCKS, MAN!!! \\"Lina\\" is a great closer, mellotrons cool, well...Peace out and buy this album cuz it's good.
0471267554|4.0|I had been highly optimistic of feeling better after reading the many reviews here that praised this diet. Unfortunately, it has not been the panacea that I had been hoping for. It has been three months that I have been following this diet very closely (except for cooking with flax oil which will destroy this outrageously expensive food). It has had positive effects for sure: less \\"hollow stomach\\" feeling without being hungry, less bloating and flatulence, need 7 1/2 hours sleep instead of 8 1/2 hours, and less need for naps. But my desire for high \\"energy\\" that I have been dreaming of all my life (42 yrs old) has not materialized. My dreams and desires are many and would require more \\"energy\\" to accomplish. I do get high energy during prolonged periods of intense physical exercise such as mountaineering, and mountain biking expeditions (See [...] ), but as soon as I return, the old lethargy comes back and I am reduced to reading about a wide variety of subjects (ex: science, geography, computers), but I do not have the drive to get involved socially and practice an activity in depth. <br /> <br />Three months may be too soon for the full effects to develop, and some sources state that as much as two years may be necessary, so I will practice it much longer. This diet is much more expensive than my previous diet. For example, I used to have oatmeal for breakfast (150g, $0.30), and now have melon (400g, $1.30); Potatoes (400g, $0.30) replaced to apples (400g, $1.20), peanuts (100g, $0.40) to walnuts (100g, $1.10). This adds up to over $1500 more per year. However, this is likely to be offset with lower medical costs, and healthier life. <br /> <br />I have always been slim (6'2\\", 160 lbs), and my weight has not changed on this diet. I'm still often hungry, so I eat two big snacks in addition to the three meals. In the first few weeks, I had slight nausea during intense exersion, occasional irritability, and cravings for pastries and cookies, which I successfully resisted. These side effects have largely subsided. <br /> <br />Just needed to warn those that expect to turn into superman overnight on this diet; the effects can be subtle and take years to develop. However, this diet is guaranteed to be way ahead of the \\"Standard American Diet\\" and even ahead of the vegetarian diets for long term health. <br /> <br />chris_goulet at yahoo dot ca
0780020685|5.0|Kurosawa's immortal masterpiece gets a new finish, with Criterion's excellent print restoration technology. The extras on the DVD are few, (a trailer and a commentary,)  but it's really the improved audio/visual quality that makes this a worthwhile DVD for your collection.<br /><br />I won't go into the story of the film since that can be readily found elsewhere, but it is worth remarking that its spin-off \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" while a fine film in its own right, can't hold a candle to this classic original.  Roberts and Sturges in making \\"The Mag. 7\\" managed to copy several scenes, but shyed away from several of Kurosawa's more controversial themes and gave less attention to camera work, particularly to shooting the landscape. I can't be sure, but it seems that Kurosawa deliberately added wind effects. His use of natural moon, fire, and sun light to complement the artificial sources is overwhelmingly powerful in intensifying a scene. His depiction of rural Japan seemlessly weaves the forces of nature and human affairs into a unity that is as rustically believable as it is beautiful.<br /><br />Toshiro Mifune, that prolific Japanese film hero in other roles, is superb as the surly but lovable Kikuchiyo as is Takashi Shimura cast as the jaded and battle-worn but martially accomplished Kambei.<br /><br />\\"Shichinin No Samurai\\" is undoubtedly one of those rare films that transcends genre boundaries and appeals universally. A true classic.
B00005JMAH|1.0|My whole family is big fan of all five books of Harry Potter and first two movies. In my opinion the second movie is even better than second book. Actors like Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) and Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart) did excellent job!<BR> We all expected with eagerness to see the third movie, even more that the book Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is our favorite- great story with strong new characters (Sirius Black and Remus Lupin). What a disappointment! The new director paid attention mostly on the effects and I think the third book deserves more than effects. <BR>I dont think David Thewlis (Professor Lupin) and Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore) are most appropriate actors for those roles. However there was a directors hit- Gary Oldman was perfect for his part (well almost- without tattoos J) I still wonder why the director made Tom the Innkeeper to looks like weak-minded and spared so much time for scene with wizards bus, but leaved out why Hermione needs time turner and more, and more no need to repeat Lin and other guys with close to mine opinions. <BR>I believe that people who read the book will understand what I mean. But maybe others, who havent read it are more lucky- they have chance to like the third movie.
B000066JES|1.0|What is this? is that Manowar or something else.<br /><br />I've been manowar fan for many many years and don't get me wrong -they're good talanted musicians, but this album got my nerves. I'm getting so tired to listen those stupid immature lyrics. they're better just to play instrumental music only, without any words. Their lyrics sound like a little kid has been trying to write some poem for kindergarden or elementary school. Just listen it careffuly: fight, fight fight for the world , fight for the king, kill who doesn't like the heavy metal etc etc etc. What a hell is wrong with them??? It is so stooopid.<br /><br />Their first albums were good, and music is awesome, even in the \\"Louder than hell\\", but this album is a total joke plus primitive lyrics. I only suggest to buy this album if you have a Manowar cd collection (as I do), other than that, just pass it!

I've had it since it first released in 2002 and I cannot believe it's taken this long for them to get big but it's about dang time! There's no going wrong with \\"Songs About Jane\\"
B00030590I|4.0|Hero is several things at once: it is a mythical story of the unification of Japan; it is a wuxia martial arts film; it is a suspense mystery.<br /><br />It is not, really, an \\"authoritarian\\" film, at least in my view. It is a story of hard moral decisions made under almost unbearable pressure.  And it is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've seen in years. It's well worth watching.<br /><br />This review will contain CONSIDERABLE spoilers for the film, so stop here if you don't want any more detail.<br /><br />The story takes place in the distant past of China, when it was divided into six fractious kingdoms; in this particular era, the Emperor of Qin is seeking to conquer all six and become ruler of the entire country. The framing story of Hero is the arrival of a nameless warrior who claims to have killed the three superhuman assassins that have sought the Emperor's life for ten years. For ten years, none have approached closer to the Emperor than a hundred paces. As a reward for each assassin he has bested, the hero is seated progressively closer to the Emperor and invited to drink with him; over drinks, he tells the story of how he defeated each of these assassins, any one of whom could have killed him.<br /><br />  Except that none of the stories are precisely true, and the Emperor deduces that in fact the \\"hero\\" is a fourth, even more deadly, assassin. He then tells HIS version of what he believed happened, and how. The nameless hero then admits he is indeed there to kill the Emperor, and we arrive at both conversing over the true version of events (which is neither the hero's first clever story, nor the Emperor's deduction), before the final denoument.<br /><br />  Those who have read either other reviews or even this one carefully can guess that the Emperor survives -- the assassin does not kill him, and dies for that choice. I can understand that some consider this to send a totalitarian message -- submit to authority, etc., die for the many, etc. -- but these are actually, in the context of the movie, choices of personal morality, and ones of great cost. The hero is not submitting to authority, but deciding that the vision of a united, no-longer-warring China is one which, in the long run, will save more lives and cause less suffering than killiing the Emperor and temporarily stopping this particular war.<br /><br />I do not, necessarily, agree, and certainly the poor characters could do with a bit less of the star-crossed fatalism which seems endemic in these sorts of movies, but in truth all of the main characters are heroes in one sense or another: the Emperor, waging a war for what he truly believes is a higher purpose, and, when cornered, willing to accept his fate at the hands of another's choice. The nameless hero, coming to stop the Emperor for the sake of his old homeland, and then coming to the most difficult decision at the critical moment; Broken Sword, the warrior who realized the Emperor's goal and accepted it, and lost his love in so doing; Snow, his true love, who did not accept this course; Sky, who was willing to risk death just to allow the Hero his chance.<br /><br />Yeah, it's all very Chinese (and somehow also very Wagnerian), but damn, it's gorgeous to watch. If one wants some of the same plot, based on the same basic story (the great warrior king trying to unify the world under his control) but one with somewhat less tragedy and ending with the Emperor getting his, Storm Riders is the way to go.he many, etc. -- but these are actually, in the context of the movie, choices of personal morality, and ones of great cost.

0800141601|4.0|As I watched First Knight, I couldn't help but think that if this film had been freed of the constraints of the original Arthurian tales, it would have been a complete success.    But for the original Arthurian tales, the casting of Richard Gere probably wouldn't be as problematic.  But for the original tales, the final siege of Camelot would be more believable.    Instead, we do feel a tinge of oddness at Gere's attempt to play Lancelot du Lac, who in Arthurian legend is very much a French aristocrat trained in all the chivalric ways, not the ranger-like, orphaned free spirit he is here.  It's too bad we do get distracted by the mismatch between character and actor, because he has some truly great moments with Julia Ormond (strong and pleasingly complex as Guinevere), hot looks, internal torment and emotional cat-and-mouse in that classic Hollywood tradition.  No need for Keira Knightley-style bared stomachs and bow and arrows here.  The conspicuous absence of important Arthurian characters like Gawain, Gareth and Mordred, of course, also distances this film from Arthurian legend so much that the Camelot setting becomes pretty much cosmetic, with only the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle being the intact element.  And even then, the film treats this relationship far differently from the original tales (the complete opposite of what happens in the legends, in fact).    If you're a purist for Arthurian legends, you will definitely be distracted by these elements.  However, distance yourself from the original tales and you'll find a classic Hollywood love story with unusually effective emotional layers, good performances, and absolutely stunning cinematography coupled with impeccable editing, the work of two masters -- director of photography Adam Greenberg (cinematographer for Terminator 2:  Judgment Day and Ghost, among others) and editor Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now).  The group shots in this film are eye-popping, recalling Akira Kurosawa's style, and director Jerry Zucker keeps the narrative flowing with nary a wasted moment.    I duck one star because of the King Arthur baggage.  To a certain extent, I feel that if you're going to change the story so much, you may as well call it something new, rename your characters and so on.  That is a small criticism, however.  First Knight, viewed on its own merit, is a highly well constructed, old-fashioned romance adventure with balanced strengths and, again, a beautifully light touch in the emotional and acting departments.  It's really something to watch the familiar story of the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot triangle come into life this satisfyingly, and just for that, First Knight would already deserve high marks.

B0000584TJ|4.0|I have this record on vynil. It is probably Steve Hillage's most art rock experimental effort, next to Fish Rising. Dave Strewart keyboard mastery is always influencial.  <br /> <br /> Back in 1972, you could not find this record in the US. I obtained it through Jem Imports aroung 1978. At the time, I was a little disappointed because Fish Rising and some really excellent Gong albums had already been release, heard, studied and admired for several years by then. I pulled in out of storage and gave it a spin again recently and the reality is this: For 1972, this would have been a really unique effort but the players are at a point of maturing as artist, but they were not there yet.  <br /> <br />  <br />For a collector, this is a must own! Not as dated as Arzachel and not as solid as Fish Rising... so you have to ask your self if Steve Hillage or Dave Stewart (Egg) are players you are a serious collector for... or do you like raw space rock? <br />For me, a needed spin!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Well by just looking at the cover of this cd and it's title we can see that the very meaningfull and deep members of the band Green Day do not like the current war on Iraq and clearly don't like Goerge Bush. Fair enough they express their opinions that's what free speech is all about. But basing a whole album on their hate for the current American system and it's leader is quite simply a joke. Anyone who knows good rock and roll can see this is only an attempt at convincing people to vote against Bush. Rock and Roll is about standing up for what you beleive in that's true but it seems that Green Day have become a sort of political band that sole purpose in making music is to convince people that the current American system is bad. <br /> <br />This is quite simply sad. Bearing in mind that the average Green day fan either has an attention span of a maximim of 2 and a half minutes or is a 12 year old kid who doesn't know the difference between the Backstreet Boys and a awesome rock band. By the way: (I don't know the difference between the backstreet boys and most modern rock bands either) <br /> <br />It's also quite ironic that on the first track green day say that people shouldn't just agree with the media. When 99 percent of the media share the exact same views as the band. <br /> <br />Lastly it doesn't matter if you're the biggest Bush hater on the planet you should agree with me. We switch on the tv politics, the radio politics, magazine politics (or that Madonna tripped last week) rock is about getting away from those things. No one does it any better than AC/DC, rock is about having a good time and yelling your brains out too, not just trying to influence people with your views. <br />

B00005QZ7U|5.0|As I was reading these reviews I was struck by the last one because I totally felt the same thing. I know Ewan was singing for me too.

068987474X|5.0|I found this book very helpful and useful. It's cathartic.

My roommate, a psychologist, recommends this book for all women.
B000003H34|5.0|This is one of those albums people tend to either love or hate, without much middle ground existing between the two. I happen to be among the former catagory.  To me, The Silent Enigma is a quintessential Doom album.  Sure, Vincent hadn't quite reached the peak of his vocal abilities when this was first released but he sings with more emotion on this than any other album.  Kinda remiscent of the clean vox of My Dying Bride in some ways.  the music is dark and brooding with influences ranging from Pink Floyd to Bathory.  They also experiment with innovative reverb techniques that add an extra dimension to the overall ambience.  When it comes to an ever evolving band like Anathema it is difficult to say which is the best album because all of them sound so different.  Personally, I consider this, Judgement, A Fine Day To Exit and Eternity to be their best, however I know there's quite a few people who would disagree. So in conclusion I'd just like to point out that it wouldn't be a bad idea to just listen to the sound samples and figure out what you like from Anathema because the opinions differ so much.
0316666343|4.0|This story was sad to start, since it is about a girl that is murdered.  At first I didn't think I could read it since I have children of my own, and the worst nightmare is your child being murdered.  I kept reading it and recommend you do the same.  This is a great book. I enjoyed the way the author wrote about heaven and the different experiences in heaven the main character experiences.  I liked that the story was told by the girl that was murdered. The story was really great and I am sure you will enjoy it.

0375500901|4.0|Daniel Silva's \\"The Kill Artist\\" in many respects is a by-the-numbers thriller.  A world-class Palestianian assassin has undertaken a daring plot to bring down the Middle East Peace Process. A lethal Israeli assassin is called out of retirement to pursue the Palestinian assassin, who destroyed his family.   <br /> <br />For many fans of the genre, this plot description would be enough, and Silva has mastered the trade of writing this kind of classic airplane fiction (you know, the kind that you need to distract you from the glories of flying coach class from Seattle to Atlanta).   <br /> <br />But fortunately, Silva has the patience and the talent to bring the reader deep within the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, a conflict where wheels turn within wheels and the left hand isn't much aware of what its own fingers are doing, much less the right hand.  We also meet Gabriel Allon, one of the great tragic heroes of the genre, who bears more burdens than your average assassin and does so with a quiet dignity that is quite moving. <br /> <br />For fans of the genre, you'll be happy to note that all the right tunes are played, and played well.  Plenty of action, a bevy of female characters straight out of a James Bond thriller -- beautiful, intelligent, and bearing deep secrets and even deeper emotions - and above all, a fine appreciation of the deep-rooted hatred that moves both sides.   <br /> <br />A must-read for the fan of the spy novel!
B00002SWEM|5.0|What a timely documentary. Just in time to capture the precious treasures from Cuba; its musicians and their music. I am so glad that they got to be recognized not only in their own country, but worldwide. One thing I noticed is that although most of them were in their golden years, their music and their vitality and life-force remain in their prime. Some of them are gone now. I'm also glad they got to play in New York. To see the wonder in their eyes at the sights and sounds and life in the big apple was heartfelt for me. If there is ever a documentary that is worthy of being in DVD, this is it.

B00007LTIA|2.0|There are many yesfans here who get upset when this work is trashed or disliked by others. Now, Im going to say off the bat in all due fairness that Im a casual Yes fan,not a die-hard.  Topographic Oceans is along 80 minute plus album with four songs averaging about 20 minutes.  ihave nothing against long,conceptual pieces(Close to the Edge is quintessential Yes),but these tracks are nothing more than aimless and meandering.  The Revealing Scinece of God fares better than most and it moves at a sprightly pace. But it seems to be more of an endless tidal wave of lyrics than music.  The Remembering has a few interesting moments but it`s in dire need of self-editing. Whatever good moments there are,it simply takes too long to wade through.  The Ancient; once again some beauitiful moments such as the leaves of green section,but long-winded with no focus.  `Ritual' seems to be more of a track stitched together like Frankenstein with a bass solo and a percussive section. I can see why critics disliked this album and some fans were turned off. It`s not art,but rather more like self-indulgence catering to one`s whimsy. The major architects and culprits of this bloatedness are Jon Anderson and steve Howe.Steve Howe stated they were trying to make a lifestyle record. There is no such thing as a `lifestyle record'. Music is to be listened to and not to base your life around. Any other notion than that is merely arrogance and conceit.

B00005JNLY|4.0|Spanglish from Director James Brooks is a good film that tries its best to tackle social issues facing immigrants, their families, and the \\"Anglo American\\" culture they meet when they move into the United States (or, in this case, out of Mexico into a Los Angeles barrio and then into \\"Anglo American\\" culture). It is well cast; the acting is wonderful. Adam Sandler proves he can listen and be the soft, sensitive man that women yearn for; Tea Lioni shines as the tyrannical American corporate wife forced into a motherhood she can't handle from downsizing. However, after all is said and done, the film comes up a bit short of my expectations. Until the last half hour, it seems to move just too slowly. The ending scene between Flor and Cristina just doesn't feel convincing; it has a certain feel to it that seems too rushed and this that leaves you unsatisfied and wanting a better way to end the picture.<br /><br />The film is actually a flashback of a young girl's childhood; we learn her story as someone reads a young immigrant girl's application to Princeton. The girl (Cristina) and her mother Flor (played beautifully by Paz Vega) come into the US, live in a barrio where her mother Flor doesn't have to learn any English and then suddenly are thrust into another culture when Flor needs and gets a higher paying job working as a maid for the Clasky family.<br /><br />Although John Clasky (played so well by Adam Sandler) is doing very, very well in his profession, he is not exactly proactive at home. His wife Deborah (played by Tea Lioni) runs the household--tyrant style! Deborah is not maternal and bossy to say the least. Her lack of faithfulness to John makes her even less likeable. While one major theme of this movie is the trouble caused when two people from two cultures try to get along, another theme is that Flor (now the Clasky maid) and John Clasky eventually become attracted to each other. What happens from there I will leave off for fear of spoiling the plot for you! (Sorry.)<br /><br />Although the Clasky family can help--greatly help--Flor educate Cristina at a very elite private school,  a painful dilemma ensues for Flor: should she hold onto her core Mexican beliefs and identity? Should she accept the Clasky's offer to send her daughter Cristina to an elite private school and take the chance for a better education than Flor could probably afford? A thought-provoking scene with Flor and Cristina ensues.<br /><br />In short, although the movie gives us a few laughs and it delivers great acting, the plot itself is just not enough to sustain it 100% of the way. There may be disagreement, too, between viewers: does Flor make the right decision about Cristina and the private school?<br /><br />What's the bottom line? I would recommend this film for its entertainment value and the performances by the actors. If you're looking for another great immortal classic like Gone With The Wind, however, you won't find it here.or you!

0141301155|5.0|TEHE Greatest book ever!!!, but I suggest getting an older version because of the artwork in the more recent version is just not the same. The latest version has just simple cute artwork but does not capture those curious images that the older versions do. The versions from the 70's and 80's are mre realistic. You can kind of tell that the artwork was geared towards adults more so than the childrens type in this issue. No matter what it is the greatest book ever!
B0000UJL96|4.0|I have to say that my favorite is still \\"The wrath of Kahn\\". Although, General Chang is a very good villain, almost reminiscent of old Kahnnie boy. The movie itself had a good storyline, but it was the ending that totally ruined it for me. The assassination attempt was reaching its climax, the shot was fired, and Captain Kirk tackles the president just in time to save his life, and then.... immediatley afterwards announces his name and the name of his ship. ((appropriate pause)) He knows who the heck you are, goofball. And then, he starts to explain exactly why all of this is going down, to a very intent audience, and everyone standing around apparantley ignoring the fact that someone's trying to bump off the president and there's a dead Klingon on the floor. No secret service with their phazers coming out of the woodwork to protect the president, and what's a good movie without the one guy who starts the slow clapping until everyone is cheering? Because after all, who doesn't enjoy a good presidential assassination attempt? CHEESEBALL CITY. All in all, except for the ending, it was a good movie. The part prior to the one discussed where Kirk blows up Chang still gives me chills everytime. But like I said, I still have to go with \\"Wrath\\" for my favorite.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I have been on this collection the past few weeks or so!  It was long overdue to combine all his hits from Jackson 5 to Jacksons to solo on 4 CDs and the one live concert CD that was aired on HBO.  I love the unreleased songs that didn't make the albums, especially the one that didn't make his 2001 Invincible album. I love We've Had Enough and its textured sound and landscapes. I noticed a lot of demos here of those future hit songs. Michael Jackson knows how to make these great songs with rhythm and hooks and melodies that stick in your head for days!  Number Ones last year was just for those who don't want to shell out $50-55 for a box set like this one. This is far more comprehensive and bigger.  And that it has 57 songs is quite something and enough for the listener!   This is the true ultimate collection from the true King of Pop!!!!!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Caution:  Do not read if you don't know what happens and don't want part of the plot spoiled!  For those fans of the first Bourne film (and those not already in the know from the books, like me) might be disappointed, if not sad, to discover in this second installment that Bourne's girl, Marie, dies at the outset.  That had me sad and distracted the whole way through the movie.  That about ruined the whole thing for me.  Otherwise my other complaint was the shaky cam filming style.  That very nearly made me nauseous and was fairly annoying.  Filming short segments of the movie in this style would not only have been far less aggravating, but also would have made for more effective artistic shooting style in my opinion.  Anyway, these things aside this Bourne film is every bit as gripping and thrilling as the first.
B00005UKKF|4.0|I liked this concert of Britney Spears better than the one-hour special she did on FOX.  It was a big, massive production, loads of lights and a lot of dancing and choreography! She did a lot of costume changes. She did a lot of songs from her three albums.  The show starts off with a dream, then builds up in momentum.  Spears does lip-sync on a few songs, but I happened to hear her band more than the record she was lip-synching over.  That concert proved that Britney is a dynamic performer and entertainer.  I hope they make a concert DVD of the Onyx Hotel tour that she did in the spring of this year. The Las Vegas element is why this concert is full of the excess and the big lights circling and swinging all across that stage.
B00008S2VG|1.0|When I listen to a CD it helps that the singer be beautiful(at least to me), as well as her voice. I think Beyonce Knowles, Gwen Stefani and Janet are sexy singers as well as beautiful. Madonna is very old looking to me now.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Definitely a wonderful movie, Seabiscuit, brings to the screen the story of four unlikely heroes who are down on their luck: a businessman/horse owner, a horse jockey, a horse trainer, and finally the horse itself.  Thanks to each other, however, they overcome life's difficulties and prevail.  The movie is set during the Great Depression of the 1930's and it is about pain and suffering, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how courage, trust, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.  A great movie indeed, full of symbolism, which will surely bring tears to one's eyes! Needless to say, Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
B00009XITQ|1.0|I would rather be tortured at gunpoint than watch this movie.  Formulaic, banal, crap.  King Ralph for teenagers.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman was GREAT, and that is a very pleasant surprise considering that I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, and thus did not know what to expect from the film.  <br />The movie combines action, adventure and comedy.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding, making this movie one of the best of its kind.  The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  The plot, the dialogues, the setting, the special effects, the battles, the music and the costumes are all wonderful! <br />In short, keep them coming!!! <br />
B000002UAR|4.0|Rubber Soul is better but this album is very good. Buy it. <br /> <br />Now.
B000000OQY|4.0|I was in high school when AFD came out - it was a revolutionary album. Suddenly even spoiled preppies found hard rock cool. I bought the follow-up, G N'R Lies, when I was in the military back in 1990. Although I was into heavier music at the time, I immediately took a liking to the four acoustic songs and I played them almost exclusively, rarely playing side one. As the one reviewer below mentioned, I too wish this whole album would've been acoustic. To this day, I consider G N'R Lies, side 2, to be one of my favorite album sides ever. The four songs just flow together perfectly, always leaving me wanting more. I would've paid full price for just the acoustic songs on this album. It's now fourteen years later, and although some of it may be sentimental, I can still sit back and enjoy these great acoustic arrangements. -1 star for side one, which never really grew on me.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|My wife and I saw TROY on the big screen with good friends, a highly educated MD and his wife.  The good doctor walked out in a huff after only an hour because he felt Homer's \\"Iliad\\" was being \\"desecrated by Hollywood.\\"  We three stayed and enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />And I like the DVD even more.<br /><br />Wolfgang Peterson fully captures the grand scale of events that engage Greek warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), Trojan Prince Hector (Eric Bana) lovers Paris (Orlando Bloom) and Helen (Diane Kruger) in a war that launched a thousand ships to recover a pretty face.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's a little jarring accepting Pitt as Achilles. He's oiled up, precisely coiffed and often photographed in golden light like a pin up.  But he's very fine in the action scenes and choreographed battles -- especially the final duel with hector. And Pitt gives it his all and almost holds his own in an emotionally pivotal scene with Peter O'Toole.  Eric Bana is a much more forceful presence than Pitt but it's O'Toole who steals every scene he's in as Troy's King Priam.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there's no commentary from Peterson and stars Pitts and Bana. It wouldn't surprise me if there's a \\"special colelctor's edition\\" DVD coming out next year. I hope it includes something -- anything at all, really -- from Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie.<br /><br />Limited extras do include: \\"In The Thick of Battle,\\" a fine featurette on the battle sequences and the training of warrior extras. \\"From Ruins to Reality\\" explores how the remains of ancient Troy were unearthed and how the production designers created their own version of the legendary city.  \\"Troy: An Effects Odyssey\\" looks at some of the stunning visual effects and the creation of the effective sound design.  There's also a 3-D tour of Mount Olympus in the \\"Gallery of the Gods\\" where we meet the fabled Greek Gods that play an important part in Homer's poem but are missing (thankfully) from the movie.  There's a brief, informative monologue that goes with each semi animated god or goddess.<br /><br />Even with mixed reviews, \\"Troy\\" grossed over $491 million worldwide.  Not too bad.  The audience doesn't lie.<br /><br />And I bet Homer would approve of his 3,200 year old poem being part of our pop culture.  I say it's great to see the \\"Iliad\\" as a glorious cinematic extravaganza (even without the gods).<br /><br />The transfer and sound are stunning.<br /><br />If you like widescreen epics, you will enjoy Troy on DVD.nformative monologue that goes with each semi animated god or goddess. <br /> <br />Even with mixed reviews, \\"Troy\\" grossed over $491 million worldwide.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Unfortunately, I didn't get to see a whole episode of Firefly while it was on Fox, but kept running across people mentioning it after it's demise while trying to help petition getting Wonderfalls back on the air. Everyone was talking about how great it was, so I had to get the set and see for myself. Boy was I impressed! I was totally blown away! I can't wait for the movie 'Serenity' to hit the theaters this coming September (knock on wood they don't change the date AGAIN--it was originally going to come out in April, but they didn't want Serenity to get lost in the shadow of the new Star Wars movie, which is totally understandable considering how few people have heard about this awesome show)!!<br /><br />I moved to WA state 9 years ago after living in Tucson, AZ for 25 years. Every time I watch one of the Firefly episodes, I feel like I'm there again, and don't want the show to end. It's not only because I miss living there so much, but because the characters are so believable, and the show itself is extremely ingenious, incorporating the old west into a sci-fi environment. I like Star Trek, the X-Files, Dark Angel, and Tru Calling (can't forget Wonderfalls, either!), but Firefly actually tops my list for science fiction favorite, by being so innovative. I just can't find the words to tell everyone how most excellent I think it is. I also can't believe that Fox doesn't know a good thing when it has it in the palm of it's hand. Not only once, but TWICE, counting Wonderfalls.
B00005JN0T|4.0|As a kid, I spent several hours on a plane seated near \\"I, Robot\\" author Isaac Asimov.  It was an unpleasant experience.  Mean, self-centered and arrogant, appeared to be Asimov's three rules of human behavior.<br /><br />More than a smidgen of that dangerous attitude infuses the cyborg menace in the terrifically entertaining I, ROBOT. Using only Asimov's title and the premise of once obedient and safe but now seemingly sentient robots run amuck, this possibly prescient action film stars Will Smith as a paranoid cop investigating a murder involving a robot.  Are his fears of a powerful robot army of workers who turn against their human owners coming true?<br /><br />Asimov may have been writing about the dangers of artificial intelligence, or a metaphor for the Communist Revolution, or perhaps an Orwellian warning about  the power of labor unions -- but don't worry, this film does not get sidetracked with any preachy scenes and in fact the screenplay by Akiva Goldman is all the more powerful because it includes just enough tantalizing intellectual moments to perfectly balance the outstanding visceral energy of the visuals.  A short making-of featurette restates the plot and hints at the complex robot choreography and CGI work.  The main extra is an insightful commentary from director Alex Proyas and Goldman.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|Ray is a genius & a legend, but his voice is no longer good enough. I found myself flinching whenever he entered the duets. Sad choice to end a career like this...
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|It's about time the movies do justice to Robert Ludlum's breathless thrillers. BOURNE SUPREMACY (Universal) follows hard on the heels 2002's \\"Bourne Identity\\" and does not disappoint.<br /><br />Matt Damon secured action star status as Jason Bourne.  In \\"Identity,\\" the amnesiac CIA agent discovers who he is.  In \\"Supremacy,\\" he discovers what he is.  Director Paul Greengrass does not let up in the forward motion of the relentlessly face-paced story when Bourne, seeking some kind of redemption for the unwanted killer identity he has discovered about himself, is framed for murder in Berlin.<br /><br />A surfeit of cool extras include better than average documentaries on the casting, photography and action sequences (car chases, fight scenes and explosions).  The startling deleted scenes are worth checking out and actually add something to the film. The informative commentary from Greengrass is actually worth listening to.
B00031TXBI|4.0|I had read on his website that this was sort of an apex in the series in john's opinion.  So, I have been waiting for this release with very high expectations.  It wasn't what I was expecting.  I love the experimental side of his work and this album is kinda lacking that (reverse guitars, experimental vocals, electronic noodling atmospherics, etc.)  It is actually his most pop/classic rock affected album of the series and that almost made me want to give it 3 stars.  However, I listened to it a few more times and it's too good for that.  He's still the man and this album showcases some great guitar work and lyrical ability.  However, ataxia tops it in guitar and will to death tops it lyrically.  I think that this might be the best place to start for someone who listens to classic rock a lot if getting into john's solo catalog.  I will still listen to it quite a bit, but I like to save 5 stars for my very favorite of each artists catalog and this is not quite there.  You should still get it though if you are a fan.  Don't let this review take away from the genius that is frusciante.  All of his music is brilliant.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|You don't have to be a hopeless geek or a hapless nerd to appreciate what might be the funniest film of the year.<br /><br />Already a certified cult hit, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE (Fox) has given new meaning to \\"Gosh!\\" as an all purpose expression of exasperation.<br /><br />I've seen this film three times and in spite of my alleged sophistication and maturity, I still laugh out loud at the perfectly captured teen 'tude that pervades this very rural comedy of manners.  Jon Heder is wonderful as Napoleon, a Preston, Idaho, high schooler coping with the mundane day to day problems of family, friends, and school.  But mostly it's the terminal boredom and growing anger of Napoleon's woefully unfulfilling circumstances that drive the quirky and weirdly charming story.  Listening to the straightforward commentary by Heder and screenwriter-director Jared Hess, it becomes clear that there's apparently little intended irony in the fact based events that make up this slightly twisted tale of not coming of age.  I hope there's a sequel. Maybe \\"Napoleon Goes To College\\"?
B00006F83Y|4.0|I had read somewhere that this album was mastered flat.  I don't know if I am explaining it properly, but anyway, that's BS.  It does keep the guitar from \\"cutting\\" through the mix, but that's ok with me.  Dave grohl is the best drummer alive I have to say and he should just quit the foo fighter thing and do what he does best.  This album features him ripping it up and the rest of the band is also top notch.  I am definitely getting rated R after hearing this.
B00063MBU8|3.0|I havn't expected much from this band cause it started out as ''reset'' and then one of the members left cause of the direction they were going in . Well , to call this '' teen angst'' and to label it to the point of not realizing the sex pistols was a band full of teen angst but people did and still love them . I don't compare the punk revival and punk pop bands to bands from the oldschool but what everyone is saying just reminds me how most of you guys are STILL teens and you are trying to tell everyone older (me) what we will expect and how we would feel . That makes no sense .<br /><br />Simple Plan is a band of quick , fun , angsty pop-punk revival songs .<br /><br />Punk is not what it used to be but everything changes . I never really did like oi punk . They were too angsty for me . I'll stick with my punk revival bands . Check out purevolume.com for some great bands and use soulseek .
B0000042H4|4.0|Personally, I find the idea that one particular set satisfies the many demands of the ring on orchestra, conductor and cast, to be specious and unrealistic. The thought that one cycle can be all you want the ring to be is of course an inviting one, if only to admire in your collection.  The reality is, however, that no conductor or cast has successfully managed to sustain themselves over the 4 operas and the fourteen or so hours of music they contain. The Solti set, it can be argued, comes as close as any to realizing this utopia. It is not perfect, however, and a more profound experience,  I think, can be found is using as many as four or five different sets to complete the whole experience.<br /><br />The Solti set is deservedly famous. It is Wagner as the uncouth rabble imagines Wagner to be; power, intensity and orchestral climaxes to blow your speakers. There is not necessarily anything wrong with that. There are orchestral moments in `Das Rheingold' and `Gotterdammerung' that are irreplaceable.  It does however often mean the more sensual, intimate and ultimately more intense and thrilling moments of the Opera are often left somewhat undeveloped. `Das Rheingold' is powerful and often rousing. It might also be called rough and ready with little in the way of subtle expression.  Act 1 of `Die Walkure' CAN be exceptionally erotic, sensual and thrilling. Siegmund's serenade to the sleeping Sieglinde in act 2 CAN be overwhelmingly tender, and Wotan's farewell to Brunnhilde CAN be suffocatingly beautiful. Unfortunately, in the Solti set, they are not. Hans Hotter is a towering Wotan, but overall it seems poetry and deep meaning have truly been sacrificed for `sonic power'. `Siegfried' and `Gotterdammerung' are, however, exceptional. Solti's Siegfried comes close to being the best on CD. His command of the orchestra in the well known forest murmurs is excellent and Windgassen is in fine voice. The Solti `Gotterdammerung' is equally impressive.<br /><br />If you are interested in purchasing this set it may well be that you are after a set that encapsulates the `whole' Ring, one that 'does it all', as it were. The Solti set is certainly the most consistent and unlike its two `commercial' competitors, The Bohm and Karajan cycles, it is not plagued by poor performances in critical roles. The Karajan cycle is often laughable. While it has its moments, the languid pacing of the score is sleep inducing at the best of times. Jess Thomas is a great letdown as Siegfried, struggling to perform in any way like a heroic tenor. The Entry of the Gods into Valhalla is compellingly dull and Vicker's `Wintersturme...' is quite awful. Had this been my first ring cycle, I seriously doubt I would have gone on to hear the Ring more than twice in my lifetime. The Bohm set is comparatively less affected and more `Wagneresque'.  The live performance is well recorded and captures much of the works spontaneous excitement. Despite the presence of James Kng and Windgassen the cast is let down, however, in its major and minor roles throughout the cycle; Theo Adam as Wotan is particularly turgid and his participation is `Die Walkure'e destroys the Opera. It is a shame really, because James King is a very, very good Siegmund.<br /><br />Tragically, many people's obsession with these three recordings limits their exposure to many more excellent modern recordings. There is a lot to be said, for example, for Levine's cycle with the Met. If you haven't heard James Morris' farewell to Brunnhilde then you are really missing something. I also find it a personal source of frustration that Boulez' `Die Walkure' is less celebrated than it deserves to be. His Act 1 is perhaps, in my humble opinion, the most perfect single act of Wagner's Ring available. Jerusalem's Seigfried in the Haitink set is also exquisite. I have purchased and listened to perhaps seven sets and the tendency of the devotees of a particular recording to absolutely dismiss the virtues of many of these other recording is really a poor reflection of the critic rather than the recording.  There is something positive to be found in any recording. That said, I would warn even my worst enemy away from the Karajan... Solti is a good option, either as an introduction or as a `set', if that is what you are after. There are, however, other roads we can take.really a poor reflection of the critic rather than the recording.  There is something positive to be found in any recording.

B0006399FS|1.0|This is the holy truth: Bono is a [...]  'It's going to blow your mind. It's real punk rock.'   'It's full on, a full throttle record. It's like punk rock from Venus. It is a mad sound the Edge is making.'  'It's a very full-on rock and roll album.'   Bono    How easy is to be U2 now: with just that brand name, no matter  how predictable and trademarked the \\"new\\" album is, U2   have sold more than 2 million copies worldwide in 1 month.   Fans are so obsessed with U2 that they dont care about these   same kind of pointless \\"songs\\" once again,dont care about Bonos   damaged voice forever, dont care about the same trademarked Edge  guitars, flat, safe and weak production, etc. With just the   \\"new U2 album\\" they go crazy like always.  Have you ever wonder what if Radiohead were U2 ?    Ok Computer would have sold 20 million copies  Hail To The [...] would have sold 15 million copies    on the other hand, if U2 were Radiohead...    ATYCLB would have sold no more than 1,5 million copies  and this new soup would sell no more than 1 millions    are you still supporting this [....] Bono ?    Bono is not even a memory of that brave young man, who was dare  to be against U.S foreing policy during the 80s ( remember  Bullet The Blue Sky ? ). Now hes [...] and he knows perfectly well its better to be quiet and dont  say anything against George Bush nor his genocide both on Iraq  and other countries in the middle east, because Bono is just   afraid of one thing: U.S sales. Thats the reason why suddenly  U2 turned for safe and commercial music forever, because Pop sales  wasnt good enough in the U.S, despite that album sold 10 millions  worlwide. With ATYCLB the band won USA again and of course they  were so much happy for that. Just remember all those [...] for the U.S victims on 11 September ( 3,000 people, by the way,  therere more than 30,000 civilizen dead on Iraq because of Bushs war )  but not even one word for victims of real terrorism across the world  afterthat 11 September. Bono shouldnt be an Irish anymore[...]    Do you really think he takes care about fans feelings ?  whether you like or hate the \\"new\\" album, he doesnt mind about that,  he just want you to buy the bloody album [...]  U2 is not a band anymore, theyre just [...], with all that  IPod, I Tunes, expensive tickets, etc.    Another album by 2006 ? what for ? more and more money.  We dont need All That You Cant Leave Behind III, we need honest musicians  trying to create NEW MUSIC again. But dont worry folks, because any new U2 crap  would sell at least 5 million copies, giving the chance to call themselves as  \\"biggest band in the world\\" once more.    U2 wont be a band anymore, because they dont have any critic with themselves.  They wrongly believed this soup would be their best. Pitiful, theyre acting like  dumb teens, not like mature men.  Dont believe I hate U2. I loved U2, but not this music company.  U2 died by the time 2000.  Goodbye to U2, and welcome ( welcome ? ) to the iPod men.    Come on, buy this soup as Christmas gift !!! support those lies, support them, because you will be supporting Bush war as well.    do they know if will be a Christmas on Iraq ?...  do they even care about that ?...  do they know with just ONE SINGLE U.S misil ( like dropped on Iraq ones ) would be enough money for to build 103 schools in Africa ?...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|With her fourth album, Britney Spears shows signs of musical growth and maturity - from the ambitious and mind-blowing \\"Toxic\\" to the sweet ballad \\"Everytime.\\" <br /> <br />1. \\"ME AGAINST THE MUSIC\\" - The first single, featuring Britney's mentor and idol, Madonna.  It's a good song with a nice beat, but Madonna's vocals ruin it. <br /> <br />2. \\"(I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM\\" - Great song...Britney attempts a move into urban territory and succeeds with flying colors.  Should've been a single. <br /> <br />3. \\"SHOWDOWN\\" - Another winner...Britney sounds incredibly sexy here, and the guitar riffs add a nice touch. <br /> <br />4. \\"BREATHE ON ME\\" - Britney's voice blends perfectly into the music, and she sounds sultry and exotic.  An outstanding dance track. <br /> <br />5. \\"EARLY MORNIN'\\" - I wasn't sure what to make of this song the first time I heard it.  It's a LOT different from Brit's usual music, but that's what this record is all about: experimentation.  Moby did a fine job producing it. <br /> <br />6. \\"TOXIC\\" - Quite possibly one of Britney's best songs EVER.  It's flawless: Britney's vocals, the production, everything.  Buy the album for this song alone, if nothing else. <br /> <br />7. \\"OUTRAGEOUS\\" - I like this song, but it sounds like a reject from a Janet Jackson or J.Lo album.  It should not have been a single, but it is a decent song nonetheless. <br /> <br />8. \\"TOUCH OF MY HAND\\" - Britney's received a lot of flack and critcism for this song, but I love it.  The lyrics are sexy (without going over-the-top) and Brit's vocals are amazing. <br /> <br />9. \\"THE HOOK UP\\" - Fun, happy song with a reggae feel to it.  I can't think of anything else to say about it. <br /> <br />10. \\"SHADOW\\" - Everything a ballad should be...near the end, Britney shows that she does possess true musical talent. <br /> <br />11. \\"BRAVE NEW GIRL\\" - An uplifting, inspirational song that feels like it should be in a \\"Legally Blonde\\" movie.   <br /> <br />12. \\"EVERYTIME\\" - A stark, heart-tugging ballad.  Britney went the wise route and kept the song low-key, moving the song along with only her vocals.   <br /> <br />All in all, \\"In The Zone\\" is a true step forward for Britney...her voice is stronger than ever, her music is progressing toward adulthood, and she proves that she is a force to be reckoned with.
0060537639|1.0|I began with an open mind, but after about the middle of the book - when I could find a new whopper being sold on almost every page - I read it only for laughs.  The huge number of historical mistakes have been listed elsewhere and can easily be found in a websearch.  However, as a traveler and ocean sailor I would like to point out some of the maritime errors, since Menzies makes the claim to have a special advantage in this area over university-trained historians.  For example, he writes that the Chinese fleet sailed southeast from the Orinoco around the easternmost point of Brasil, near Recife.  I recently was windsurfing this coast and can state that the winds howl from ESE at 15-30 knots year-round, making such a feat impossible for the bulky chinese square riggers which could not effectively go to weather.  Menzies also writes that the fleet passed through the Tuamotus in what is now French Polynesia.  Until the advent of GPS, this huge string of low coral atolls was known as the Dangerous Archipelago.  The reefs are impossible to see at night, currents are wild and unpredictable, seas can be very heavy, the winds and geography offer many a lee shore, and without charts very few vessels have survived a passage there.  Even cruising sailors with a good ability to go upwind usually avoided it.  I sailed there a few years ago with GPS, accurate charts, and radar to pick up the palm trees at night - and it was still hairy.   <br /> <br />Menzies makes much of maps being distorted because the sailors were caught in ocean currents.  Yet any sailor within sight of land can discern if he is in a current, and in fact a good sailor will also know such a thing far from land because of the behavior of his boat.  If the fleet had been sailing due north off the coast of Africa, for example, they would have run aground on the westerly bulge of the continent long before the current carried them clear.   <br /> <br />One could list many more such obvious errors, but it would only waste your time, just as Menzies wasted mine.  The point here is not that his thesis is impossible, or that his mistakes deny everything in Menzies' book.  The point is rather that the author is unable to distinguish between what is true, what is possible, what is unlikely, and what is impossible.  And because of this lack of distinction, the book is garbage.
0375713751|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  I really felt like this woman was living my life in England.  It really made me see how much I do.  I found myself wanting her to hook up with the American man just one time for the fun of it.  Mainly because I knew I never would so I wanted to have her live it for me.  It is really a good read.  Enjoy!
1400049628|1.0|Books like these, in order to be really successful and entertaining, need a more holistic approach to their subject matter; a kind of comedy improvisational sensibility where the author agrees to try and never say 'No' to any idea ever put forth by the vast body of media on their subject. From this they derive the comedy inherent in writing something like 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. The author's decision to focus on one aspect of zombie lore, the virus zombie, ends up being quite depressing and boring after a few chapters. <br /> <br />In addition to being repeatedly self-contradictory, poorly researched, containing questionable causalities, and being a mediocre execution of even faux-academic writing: this book isn't worth your time or money, zombie fan or not. The illustrations are also pathetic, on par with the average non-artistically inclined grade school student. All these facets of substandard literary quality will not even rate it highly as a cult-object regarding the zombie for horror film, folklore, or simply zombie afficionados. <br /> <br />The saving grace (and the totality of its one-star rating) lies in the 'Recorded Attacks' chapter where the author invents a series of zombie attacks through the ages, from our cave-painting ancestors to gangsta dealt with infestations in 21st century L.A.. However, Max Brooks (the author) could have saved himself a lot of time and effort by just writing 20 bad movies rather than 1 bad book using the slightly compelling fragments of narratives contained in its rear pages. At least he could've been a millionaire...
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas is an astounding showcase of everything that makes Mariah the top music artist of all-time.  Not only does this album offer outstanding vocals, it also provides the emotional feel of Christmas time.  Starting off with a low-key, quiet vocal performance of the classic \\"Silent Night,\\" Mariah then transitions to the exuberant sounds of \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You,\\" a great song for all to dance to.  Next is the magical masterpiece, \\"O Holy Night.\\"  Mariah's vocals on this traditional holiday hit are simply stunning!!!  This is her best vocal performance on this album, without a doubt!  Track #4 is \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),\\" a fun song where Mariah is obviously longing for her baby to come home.  Great for those who are missing their babe.  Following \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" is \\"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time).\\"  In my opinion, this is the best song on Merry Christmas.  Although it contains sad lyrics, \\"Miss You Most (At Christmas Time)\\"  displays Mariah's great, soulful, dreamy, whispery tone.  \\"Joy To the World\\" opens on a quiet note, then switches to an irresistible dance beat.  You gotta get up on your feet to this one!  \\"Jesus Born on This Day,\\" the next track, offers another captivating vocal performance by Mariah.  Backing her up is an incredible choir, who give this song a nice gospel feel.  \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town\\" is a great one for the kids!  Nothing better than Mariah getting your kids into the holiday spirit!  \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing/Gloria (In Excelsis Deo)\\" is again a staggering vocal performance by Mariah.  Touching, heartfelt, and emotional are three ways to describe this excellent rendition.  Ending the album in a fun, holiday-like way is \\"Jesus Oh What a Wonderful Child.\\"  Once again, this Christmas classic displays Mariah's stupendous vocals.      Bottom Line:  You can't go wrong with this album!  Mariah never fails to provide us with top-notch, high quality performances.

B000002A46|5.0|Few commercial Christmas albums really appeal to me - too many of them mangle the traditional classics I love, especially the hymns, with all sorts of fancy modern sounds that ring hollow to my ears, and, loving the traditional songs so much, few modern Christmas tunes manage to win me over.  Ten years after its release, though, Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas CD remains a perennial Christmas favorite of mine.  Mariah's vocal talent puts her head and shoulders above every female vocalist out there, and she injects true feeling and spirit into every song she sings.  On this album, she combines the new with the old, making this a Christmas CD that almost everyone can love.<br /><br />Like many, I was drawn to this CD after hearing the song All I Want For Christmas Is You; I believe it's the best secular Christmas song since Elvis' Blue Christmas.  I had to buy the album for this one song alone, but I was also very anxious to hear what Mariah would do with traditional hymns such as Oh Holy Night - my pick for the greatest Christmas song ever written.  Many a soprano shies away from truly hitting the high notes at the end of Oh Holy Night, and given Mariah's vocal range, I felt confident she would do the song justice.  I was right, as this is one of the best versions of Oh Holy Night I've ever heard.  Mariah's voice is equally angelic on Joy to the World, Hark the Herald Angels Sing, and a properly subdued Silent Night.  Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child is a song I was less familiar with, but it makes for a stunning conclusion to an album that does pay real heed to the reason for the season.<br /><br />Besides All I Want For Christmas Is You, Mariah co-wrote two other songs on the album: Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) and Jesus Born on This Day.  The latter is an especially beautiful song that expresses the true meaning of Christmas.  She also throws in an exceedingly fun version of Santa Claus is Coming to Town (and, thankfully, I can now think of Mariah rather than Bruce Springsteen whenever I hear this song).  The perfect complement to All I Want For Christmas Is You, though, is Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).<br /><br />Put it all together and you have a true modern Christmas classic featuring a wonderful mix of religious and secular songs that radiate both the fun as well as the serious aspects of the Christmas season.  Anyone who loves Christmas - and Christmas music in particular - really should make this CD an annual part of his/her holiday celebration.an Bruce Springsteen whenever I hear this song).

1400082773|5.0|I loved this book and highly recommend it for anyone. <br />Obama traces his earliest memories and introduces us to his caucasian and african families. <br />His honesty in expressing his feelings is a trait that is hard to find in many. <br />Again, I strongly recommend this book for anyone who loves good literature. <br />
048623231X|5.0|I have always admired Gustave Dore's work, both for its beauty and its emotion, but he (like Norman Rockwell) has always been a little ignored by the critics because he was a book illustrator(gasp!). Anyway, this Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy, in my opinion, is his best work.  Why? Because of the range - from hell to heaven and everywhere in between. His imagination perfectly captures Dante's even greater imagination, and as the book progresses from Inferno to Purgaturio to Paradisio you get the impression of floating into the heavens.  The translations, from Longfellow, are a little dated, but they work.

1400032717|3.0|I think this book is being marketed for adults, which is curious, because it reads like a number of young-adult (YA) novels out there these days. I think teenagers would enjoy this book just as much as adults seem to be enjoying it, and I hope it finds its way into some kids' hands. <br /> <br />The jacket copy bills the book as something of a mystery. I feel this is inaccurate. I found the plot twists pretty transparent (with the exception of one -- the fate of Christopher's mother), and usually I'm awfully thickheaded about these things. As it happened, I wasn't surprised by many of the twists and turns in this book. <br /> <br />The genius of this book is that it is the portrait of a decaying marriage, seen from outside that marriage -- through the eyes of the couple's autistic son, Christopher. The book is really about how Christopher deals with his parents' split -- a split he doesn't even know has occurred. And once he does know, the manner in which he handles this information is very different from dozens of other YA \\"problem novels,\\" because of his autism. <br /> <br />Read in this manner, \\"The Curious Incident...\\" is a pretty interesting, skillfully-written book. Reading it as an exercise in voice and character is missing the point completely.
B00000373U|5.0|The transition Elliott Smith made from his Self-Titled to this release is quite good and really is the appropriate progression to have been made by him. His Self-Titled is pure folk, and my favorite album of his, but that is beside the point. \\"Either/Or\\" still clings to that heavy folk sound, but Elliott began experimenting with other genres, which he would perpetuate with each subsequent release. \\"Either/Or\\" is my second favorite Elliott Smith, which features some of his absolute best work.<br /><br />\\"2:45AM\\" is my standout favorite track. It is a new precedent of quality set for modern day songwriting. The lyrics of this track really manifest his brilliance: \\"I'm going out sleepwalkin/ Where mute memories start talkin/ The boss that couldn't help but hurt you/ And the pretty thing he made desert you/ I'm going out now like a baby/ A naïve unsatisfiable baby/ Grabbing onto whatever's around\\". I do, however, wish the song were a minute longer. \\"Ballad Of Big Nothing\\" is my next favorite. I believe this song has the best production of the album. The opening and ending riffs he employs are hypnotic. \\"Alameda\\", another really good song, starts off with some folky picking, loud but slow paced drum beat, and Elliott layering his vocals with a harmonic choir sound, if you will. Then, about half way through adds some bass and intensifies the guitar picking-It's amazing.<br /><br />Other greats are \\"Pictures Of Me\\", \\"No Name No. 5\\", \\"Between The Bars\\", \\"Rose Parade\\", \\"Say Yes\\", \\"Cupid's Trick\\", \\"Angeles\\", \\"Speed Trials\\", and \\"Judy And Punch\\".<br /><br />If you are paying attention, you should have noticed that that is all of the songs. Meaning this is another perfect release by Elliott Smith.<br /><br />If you look back, the style of this album was the perfect blend of his Self-Titled's more pure folk sound, and the more beatles/beach boys-esque sound that would become of his \\"XO\\" album. It's just a blend that is utilized to the fullest. The end result is just pure brilliance. This guy just never ceases to astound me. Do yourself the greatest favor and purchase this album (along with all other albums by Elliott Smith).to astound me. Do yourself the greatest favor and purchase this album (along with all other albums by Elliott Smith).

B0000C7PSW|5.0|From the first to the last song I was captivated. Rufus has a way like no one else. Rare and briliant! Today a lot of the stuff you hear is all cookie cutter (sonically & musically) and boring by all means. Not Rufus Wainwright! No cookie cutter here. Only heart bleeding magic in a world so burnt on everything. He makes me feel alive again...NO easy task! <br />
B00002EPJH|5.0|My son, who listened Two Nights Solo Concerts of Keith's Comeback 1999 inside his mother's body and who repeatedly listened this silent album during his newborn days in order to getting asleep, has played his solo in public in children's recital.  His tunes were not Gershwin or Cole Porter, but his tempo was very alike those of Keith in this album. <br /> <br />The mental status of Keith in this album is so intense.  But the intensity is directed toward inside, thus his moaning (although I like this) is rarely heard.  He was physically sick in this period.  Thus, the purity and spiritual strength of tunes are overwhelming.  For example, \\"Blame it on my youth\\" here is somewhat slower and even sounds philosophic compared to the same tune in 1990 NY Trio Live album \\"Cure\\" where Keith and Peacock interact as if they miss their younger ages and adolescence. <br /> <br />Keith does not play much in this album.  Only the essence is played, e.g. in \\"Shenandoah\\".  His internal power transmits and encourages listeners to challenge in their lives.  My smaller son of age one is now repeatedly listening to this Keith.
B000001FTD|5.0|This is one of the best old school THRASH albums ever made. The tempo changes and \\"mosh interludes\\" are as good as it gets for this era of metal. Another thing is the attitude this band portrayed-POSITIVE. I love doom and gloom with the best of them, but after hours of scandanavian black metal, it's nice to lighten the mood. This band is one of the finest heavy metal bands(with either lead singer) that's ever walked the earth. I recommend anything they've recorded!
B0006213WG|5.0|After listening to All Killer No Filler so many times and getting bored of that, I decided to give that away, then a friend made me listen to this, I expected this to be not very different, but it was actually a real change for Sum 41 and they realize that they can do punk/rock, and not pop/rock. Though there still is pop, it's nothing like All Killer, this is far better and much more rock then anything they've previously done. <br /> <br />Intro-4/5 It's a cool little riff that leads into the second song. <br />No Reason-5/5 An awesome beginning to a great cd. This song is punk/rock, without the yelling he does in most of his other tracks. <br />We're All to Blame-5/5 An awesome punk/rock verse, with a poppy chorus. All together, a great mix. <br />Angels with Dirty Faces-3.5/5 Not too fussy on this song, very punk/rock, but just ok <br />Some Say-5/5 A nice song to listen to, nothing special, just pretty. <br />Bitter End-4.5/5 A completely rock track with nothing but awesome riffs and cool verses/chorus. <br />Open Your Eyes-4.5/5 A cool song, nothing more. <br />Slipping Away-2.5/5 And I'm yawning away. <br />I'm Not the One-5/5 This song is cool, and it does resemble a Linkin Park song, but is definitely not a ripoff and is actually one of the best songs on the album. <br />Welcome to Hell-4.5/5 This song is pretty cool. <br />Pieces-5/5 Another slower song but it's just as good. <br />There's No Solution-5/5 The best song on here, super cool riff and the verse and chorus come together great. <br />88-4/5 The beginning riff rocks, the rest is a sleepathon and just plain garbage. <br /> <br /> Obviously Sum 41 still has weaknesses in some of their songs, but it's better then half the album being terrible. So I say they have improved majorly and I am looking forward to another album from them in the next few years. Definitely a cool album, get it today!!
B000060MMI|5.0|This should have won \\"album of the year\\" at the Grammy awards in 2002. Out of over 300 cd's in my collection' this one \\"inspires\\" me more than most. If you can listen to \\"Another bag of bricks\\" and not want to MOSH, You need to pick up some Air Supply on 8 Track!
B0000640VO|5.0|Have you ever seen a French movie filmed outside in Paris, so beautiful, yet never once shows the Eiffel Tower. <br />Wonderful movie! <br />
B00006SFBD|4.0|I strongly recommend this cd for anyone interested in Euopean grindcore. Opeth's musical talent and \\"bleakness\\" rather than overt worship of Satan also lend them credibility! Check out the last 3 minutes of \\"Deliverance.\\" It's great to reign that down on some suburban droopy drawers wearing \\"boom boxers\\" at redlights. \\"For absent friends\\" eloquently brings us to \\"Master's apprentices.\\" Scandanavian metal at it's best!
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I love this soundtrack from start to finish.  However I am forced to give it 4 stars for omitting the greatest pieces of music in the entire trilogy, in my humble opinion.  Specifically the music from the chapters in the DVD \\"The Last Move\\" and the start to \\"Mount Doom.\\"  Put those in a grand collection and I would be happy as a clam
B000002HMH|4.0|I like ReLoad more than Load. But it's doable for a Metallica album. You see a regenerating formula between this and tha black album. I like:<br /><br />-The House Jack Built-<br /><br />-The Outlaw Torn-<br /><br />Though people I know \\"Until It Sleeps\\" I don;t really care for it. This album is not a let down, but a change of the music generation.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I haven't seen this movie, but I would like to.  I just thought I would mention that I recently got back from Acapulco, Mexico.  This movie was on at the theater.  They translated the title into Spanish, and it was called \\"Lost in Tokyo.\\"  It doesn't get much better than that.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I am thrilled with the SACD version of this classic. It's given me a chance to get to experience one of Dylan's greatest albums all over again. It's hard to express how fine the SACD sound is. Maybe the best way I can explain it is this: think about how much new detail you hear when you listen to a favorite album for the first time through headphones. The ambience, the pick on the guitar strings, the voice in breathy detail. SACD gives you that through regular speakers. Plus, the sound is definitely warm and atmospheric, no harsh highs like on the regular CDs. I can't wait to see the whole Dylan catalog released on SACD. <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|The great thing about this set is the chance it gives one to reconsider some of the opening acts.  In 1985 I tuned in to see Zeppelin, Clapton, Santana, Sabbath, Queen and Bowie.  Now with these dvds you can take your time and appreciate some of the lesser known bands like Ultravox, The Style Council, Spandau Ballet and Status Quo.  Some of the best gifts are the ones that you didn't even know you wanted.

B000002U82|5.0|This is worth every penny of the $10 your going to spend on this cd. It's worth it. This cd features great vocals from Roger Waters who is one of the best vocalists ever. I love the lyrics for \\"Money\\" and \\"Brain Damage\\" which are two of the best Pink Floyd songs and alone are worth $10. If you want to hear his best vocal performance buy \\"The Wall\\" cd set. Great female vocals on \\"Great Gig In the Sky\\". David Gilmour really knows how to play guitar, and really shows it on this cd. Great solos throughout the songs that you'll never forget. Even the saxophone gets you addicted to this cd. The keyboard really brings each song together and is cool to listen to especially on \\"On the Run\\". With the vocals, guitar solos, keyboard solos, and saxophone solos, this cd is one of the best and you'll hear 9 of the best songs you ever heard in your life. <br /> <br />SONG RATINGS: <br />1. Speak To Me/Breath-(4:00)-10/10 <br />2. On the Run-(3:32)-10/10 <br />3. Time-(7:06)-10/10 <br />4. Great Gig In the Sky-(4:44)-9/10 <br />5. Money-(6:31)-10/10 <br />6.

Eclipse-(5:58)-10/10 <br /> <br />OVERALL-Great cd for beginners, but I suggest picking up \\"The Wall\\" before this, right after this, or right with this cd. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0002SROT0|4.0|Elliott Smith is the best songwriter of this generation, but this unfinished work leaves a little more to be desired.  The recording process was cut short on his part due to his untimely death, and the seams are shown by the people who finished the album posthumously. <br /> <br />From a Basement on the Hill has a couple weak songs, and a couple great ones.  It's not as heroic as XO and not as beautiful as Figure 8, but still enjoyable. <br /> <br />High points are Memory Lane, Fond Farewell, King's Crossing, and A Distorted Reality. Worth the money for a fan, but it's not a good example of Elliott Smith to a person unfamiliar with his other releases.
B00006RU5B|5.0|audioslave is one of the very very very few bands that put out kick ass rock these days.  forget overproduced trash like linkin park, hoobastank, etc. chris cornell can sing like no one else in rock, and the band is awesome behind his voice.  i was skeptical at first because i wasnt sure how the styles of soundgarden and rage would mesh, but they sound like they were meant to be together from the beginning.  awesome cd overall. its the rare type that you can just let play all the way through and enjoy every song.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Here's a film that's 99% special effects... there must have been plenty of money for this... yet the flying babies are not scary. Creepy, maybe, but not scary. The acting, the dialogue, the story, totally missing romance -- it's all just lousy.
068987474X|1.0|this book is worthless and the women who read it for serious help are idiots.  to understand the problems with the book, look no further than the 2 authors: 1 man and 1 woman. <br /> <br />first: women do not understand how men think, and if they try to tell you otherwise they are morons. <br /> <br />second: you may say \\"but hey, look a guy co-authored the book!\\" so it must be factual.  but no straight man would ever participate in creating a book like this.  and if the author is gay then he has just as little insight into the mind of a straight man as the female author. <br /> <br />so, buy this book as a gag gift or something, but if you have to be a fool to take it seriously.
B000003N7K|5.0|I first heard this about twenty years ago and was literally swept off my feet. I have since purchased it as a gift at least a dozen times. It is, arguably, the finest jazz ballad vocal album ever recorded. Just buy it and prepare to be entranced!!!
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie has the sophistication most modern day movies lack. It isn't your typical love story because you really don't know if they were meant for each other. In this movie, it simply doesn't matter. The concept that some former reviewers cannot grasp is the fact that this movie isn't simply about two people who are in love but how painful love can be and how that pain builds a person. Jim's character grows from his relationship and taking those memories away puts him back at the beginning. The interesting concept about this movie is how the thought that maybe people aren't destined to meet their one and only, but instead love is clumsy and we stumble into someone and then fall in love......and then fall back out. If one can't focus enough time for those two characters then apparently he or she should go back to the $2 action flicks. If you want something alittle less mainstream sewer line, I strongly recommend this movie. It is worth every penny.
0064407667|4.0|This book captivated my 5th Grade students.  They were very eager to read along with me and have requested the next 2 books in the series.

B000065PUE|5.0|The Pixies were so irresistably cool and catchy. Doolittle sounds like it was made in some intergalactic recording studio hurdling through the solar system. Who knows what the hell \\"Debaser\\" is about but holy crap does it rock! The rest of it is just so twisted and good it would be a crime to ignore it. The Pixies may have been the last truly fresh and original band to come out.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|How can Michael Mann still be overlooked when a discussion of the great American filmmakers come up? This film is an impressive thriller film combining clever dialogue with subtle dialogue and explosive action to rise the ranks easily to the top films of the year. Tom Cruise plays bad guy, hitman, Vincent (and plays a bad guy very well, by the way). Ala Hitchcock, the innocent man, Max (Jamie Foxx) gets in the way, gets involved, and gets thrown in the middle. Now, people are tooting Foxx's horn pretty early for an Oscar nod, but I think he should just settle for the fact that we'll take him seriously as an actor from now on, not just a comedian. The film dazzles, surprises, is barely guessable, and a lot of fun. And with dialogue that is so refreshingly unique and witty, I'm so pleased that this film boosts the stock of an otherwise weak year in film.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am truly amazed by this album. i find it funny that the people who are giving this one star are the ones who are giving slipknot 5 stars. u2 is not a heavy metal band, they just make the most passionate and inspiring anthems you will ever hear. I AM NOT SAYING THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM IN HISTORY. Its just a great album. When Bono sings \\" can you hear me when i sing/youre the reason i sing\\" and he hits that unbelieveable note, it is drenched with emotion. Thats the great thing about Bono: he sings from his heart. thats something i couldnt say about most music these days. Just give this album an objective listen. The best tracks are \\"sometimes you cant make it on your own\\", \\"yaweh\\" and \\"miracle drug\\"
B0000028RR|5.0|Words alone cannot describe the genius quality of this album! It DEFINITELY puts poser bands like Limp Bizkrap to shame! Unlike one particular reviewer such as Avril Lavinge's Number #1 fan! What a loser, he or she claimed that Fred Durst created rap-metal! What!!!???? Are you insane?! Rap-metal became good when Rage exploded onto the scene you idiot! Fred can't hold a candle to the legendary Zack De La Rocha's white-boy rapping style! Also he or she claimed that Anthrax was a poser band too, what is this person on!? By calling a good band like Anthrax a poser band, your basically a poser YOURSELF! Idiot! That guy or girl's got a lot to learn about good music! <br />Anyway, like I said before this is a quality album, Tom Morello's guitar work is a stroke of pure blinding riffs, he is one talented musician (just check out Audioslave!). Everyone knows 'Killing In The Name' one RATM's most popular, if not THE most popular song in thier catalouge! <br />Brad Wilk is spot on at the drums and keeps the beat perfectly! Timmy C's bass is remarkably loud and as vicious as ever. <br />Zack's anger towards the political views of the world are without doubt the trademark of this album! <br />Its just a shame other bands who were influenced by Rage couldn't live up to this in anyway possible, (Hed)p.e anyone?
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was a freshman in high school in 1985. I remember hearing everybody talking about it, and sadly, I didn't have cable back then, so didn't get to see it. Now nearly 20(good grief) years later, I finally got to see (mostly anyway) what the buzz was about. First, for all the complaints I've read about missing sets or songs, be happy, VERY happy, this was released at all! This show was never intended to be released for home video at all originally. Second, yes, some of the artists in the shows weren't the best that day. That would explain why alot of them aren't around anymore, huh? The horizontal lines on screen during some numbers are annoying, but explained by the booklet in the set as produced by sound overload in the recording equipment, so just grin and bear it. I personally thought the picture quality to be quite good for the time and for the logistics involved. The sound really surprised me, being much better then bargained for. I agree that the Wembley show had a bigger share of great performances, and it seemed the Wembley crowd was much more inclined to party and enjoy themselves than the Philly crowd. Maybe the heat in Philadelphia that day had everybody reserving thier excitement. A few stand-out performances from the set include David Bowie, U2, Mick Jagger with Tina Turner, George Thorogood, Dire Straits. The best of the entire show, however, was Queen. Freddie Mercury was on fire! I enjoyed Queen's music for years, but I have become a big Queen fan now because of their 20 minutes or so of stage time in this show. I know some are harping of commercialism, of wanting to line corporate pockets with this release, but really this DVD is for a noble and great cause, just like the original show: to feed starving people. Any music fan should snap this set up for the historic event that it was, and for the performances that ensued, and for the reason it was done.
B00018D44U|4.0|Unlike most of the world, I never got Norah's first album. I bought this one totally on a whim. I hadn't even heard one song from it, but I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />I'm glad I took the chance. This is a VERY good album. Norah's got a great voice and there's a nice mix of songs on here.<br /><br />Considering that I don't care for most of the music by musicians close to Norah's age, this album really surprised me. Norah shows a maturity and a talent that aren't very common these days.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this. Do yourself a favor and give it a listen.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|This is mainly in response to the last few reviews who have questioned why someone with a history of keeping his fans on their collective toes would \\"stoop\\" to commercialism and release a greatest hits package.  Lionel Trains, which Young owns something like 20 percent of, just filed for bankruptcy, so I've got a hunch this release might be a little more than coincidence.  Upon learning this, all I can do is laugh and let any bitterness slide...Neil wins this round folks.  So in the end, maybe this saves a pioneer in toy trains and introduces a whole new round of listeners to the genius of Neil Young.
B000002WPI|5.0|I'm not gonna pretend like a know a whole lot about the history of Hip-Hop and rap music to write this review.  All I know is what I like--tight beats and ill lyrics, and this album is a classic because it excells in both areas!  I'm not into most newer \\"Hip-Hop\\" that is played on the radio or on MTV;  most of it all sounds the same, and its pretty weak.  This album came out over ten years ago and sounds just as good now as it did then, and that is ten times better than most of the B.S. you hear anymore.  I remeber when I first heard of the Wu-Tang Clan back in 1993 (when I was only 13!) when I first saw the videos for Method Man and C.R.E.A.M.--I couldn't wait to hear more!  It took a few months, but I finally got this album and haven't grown tired of it ever since.  Its not on constant rotation, but I've got every track memorized, even the sketches, and the $hit never gets old!  If you don't have it yet, what's your excuse?  Never dated or outdone, Wu's first album is one of the greatest albums of any genre, and I'm a fan of Punk, Metal, Classic Rock and even Jazz, and this is still one of my all time favorites.

The death of poor Wellington brings out his inner Sherlock, and he is determined to solve the case, working in his logical fashion, despite the objections of his father.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this investigation uncovers a lot more than the identity of the canine garden fork killer, and he is faced with several difficult emotional issues which his mind is unable to handle.<br /><br />Brilliantly told in the words of Christopher himself, this novel allows the reader a rare look into the world of autism, or as much of it as we presently understand, and shows clearly the challenges an autistic person faces on a daily basis.<br /><br />The mathematics and logic puzzles may not be for everyone, but I especially liked \\"The Monty Hall Problem\\", which I pondered for a long time before agreeing that the \\"vos Savant\\" solution is the most logical.  Now at least I know that if I were ever called up for a game show that required me to choose from three closed doors, I should cross my fingers and switch as quickly as possible, even if one third of me knows I'll still get Monty's goat.<br /><br />Eloquently told in simple language, this book is a must read for young adults and old adults alike, especially those with a penchant for a drastically different outlook on life.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 19, 2004fferent outlook on life. <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, December 19, 2004
0802130208|5.0|This is most definitely one of my favorite books -- ever!  Its \\"anti-hero\\", Ignatius J. Reilly, is possibly the most annoying, repugnant human being ever to grace the earth... and reading about him and his perturbing exploits is so entertaining!!!  He is a total slob who still lives at home with his mother, who he verbally abuses and takes for granted, yet he still manages to foster a false sense of superiority and smugness in everything that he does...<br /><br />This book is truly a delight to maneuver through, and I would not hesitate for a second to pick it up and read it again... It is a shame that John Kennedy Toole left us before writing more colorful and masterful works such as \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" -- heaven only knows how much better he could have become over time, and we the readers would have been rewarded many times over...
0316168815|2.0|Like lots of other reviewers here, I thought this book started off beautifully, began to drag about halfway through, then went straight downhill from there. One gets the impression that Ms. Sebold somehow lost her grip on the story and couldn't quite figure out how to end it. It's a shame, because if she had figured out how to end the book well as she began it, we would truly have a masterpiece here.     Personally, I don't mind stories being a bit far-fetched, but the scene mentioned by the other reviewers just felt like a cop-out to me. It's good to see that I'm not the only one who sat back and said, \\"What the...\\" What bothers me isn't even the fact that the character comes back and has sex; it's the fact that she even comes back at all. On top of that, we don't even get a satisfying resolution to the crime that was committed in the beginning of the book.     In The Lovely Bones, Ms. Sebold creates and builds up a beautiful, heartwrenching story, then manages to completely destroy it by going off in strange directions with the storyline. I almost think that the first and second halves of the book were written by two different people.
B0002OERI0|5.0|In responce to the reviews that Green Day should stick to music and not concern themselves with politics, one should really listen to the album before throwing up your arms and claiming that American Idiot is an unfair onslaught on the Bush administration. If one listens to the entire album and understands the picture that it is painting, one would see that although Green Day voices their opinions on world matters, the album is about finding something, anything to believe in, not \\"believe what we belive.\\" The character Jesus of Suburbia struggles through heart ache, apathy, and drug use in an attempt to find something to believe in. All I'm trying to say here is don't pass judgement on an incredible album and and incredible band if you can't even understand the album.
B00006EXL5|5.0|1. I don't know who the hell Thursday is <br /> <br />2. I don't care who Thursday is <br /> <br />3. This is the best CD I've come accross in years
B000004166|5.0|This CD is fantastic, with wonderful music provided by Mozart, great violin play from Grumiaux, and great symphonic accompaniment by the LSO conducted by Sir Colin Davis. <br /> <br />The sound is fresh and lively, and each piece is a joy to hear.  All concertos are collected into a twofer package which is very affordable.  One of my favorite classical CDs.
6305910189|5.0|If you haven't heard this quote, &quot;The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few or the one&quot;. Then, you should check this film out. When this film came out, it's surpassed every trekkie's expectation. The film's main storyline revolves around this quote. It's one great film.
B000001ES9|5.0|Here you have it! The first album of the greatest band ever! And it is definetly a pleasing one. Of course, this debuet dosen't compare with Moving Pictures or Permanent Waves, but it is fun to listen to. It kicks off with Finding My Way, not the best thing they've released but will still please. Need Some Love is great as well as What You're doing, In the Mood, Working Man, and Take a Friend. The only down side to this album... The Professor has not arrived yet. Not that this drummer. John Rutsey, is bad, but I need the superb drumming of Neil Peart to be completly satisfied. However, pick this up after you listen to some of their greater works such as Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, 2112, and Vapor Trails.
B0006399FS|3.0|<br />I've been listening to U2 for more than 20 years now.  I was extremely pleased when they broke huge and loved to be able to share them with friends who previously did not get it.  Though now we are sadly seeing the side effects of breaking so huge.  Way back when Joshua Tree was the toast of the town Bono got bit by the marketing bug, though some would say he's had it all along. <br /> <br />Since that fateful bite it seems as though each and every U2 album is preceded by a marketing blitz worthy of any hot Christmas toy.  Sometimes the marketing is in tune with the product (Achtung baby) and other times it is sadly far from the mark (Pop).  Remember that sad in-store promotional the band gave?   <br /> <br />This album was preceded by the customary hype and hoopla.  Bono gave the same tired quotes \\"this is the album we have wanted to make for years\\" \\"on this album we return to our true U2 sound\\" etc...  I will say that U2 with their last two releases are returning to a version of their earlier self.   <br /> <br />The Music on Atomic Bomb far and away out strips Pop and Zooropa, but is a step backwards from All that you can't leave behind.  The catchy songs are there, but they are lacking.  The album has it's moments.  Vertigo is undeniably catchy and fun to listen to.  Miracle drug is a beauty.  Yahweh is a pleasure to listen to also.  But other than those the songs a re largely indistinguishable from one another. <br /> <br />If you are a hard core U2 fan, then you don't need my help in deciding whether or not to purchase this album.  You'll love and deny all negative thoughts surrounding it.  If you're a marginal fan or just a fan of music looking to buy something, this isn't it, go look elsewhere, or at least listen to it a couple times before you buy it.  I'm a little of both so I own it, though the next time I hear Bono saying all the usual quotes I think I'll pass until I hear the whole thing else where. <br /> <br />If I want to listen to that old U2Bono was referring to, I think I'll just pull out that Old U2 and leave this puppy in the CD rack.
B00004RF8J|5.0|When I first saw this movie I was amazed.  It was breezy and fun, yet a very dark comedy underneath.  It was a perfect blend of the two genres and it reminded me why \\"Rocky Horror\\" was so successful.  I believed this movie would be playing at midnight shows, but it never took off.  I blame home video for that and Warner Brothers for not recognizing its full potential.   <br /> <br />Casting was perfect.  The special effects were cheesy enough.  The cameo appearances were flawless.  Steve Martin as a S & M dentist really steals the picture.  The musical numbers are fine, the sets are great and the story is classic.
B00015HVI8|2.0|If you're a new Stargate fan, my advice is to skip season 6 and go directly to season 7. Catch it on TV if you get the chance, but if you don't, you won't miss much. I watched each season 6 episode through once on TV, and even though I can rewatch every other season over and over again, I have no desire to see season 6 six again. There are a few good episodes in, like Abyss, but far too many dull, pointless ones, like the X-Files rip-off Nightwalkers. <br /> <br />It's the only season I skipped buying the DVDs for. I suggest you do the same.
B00004U8P9|4.0|During the 15 years I have had this movie on home video I discovered it made more sense drunk than it did sober.  Thats OK, most cult movies work that way.  Still, this is an amusing romp of moral decay and hilarity.  Its a social satire at times, and at other times its just plain ridiculous.  I always felt let down by the last 30 minutes, but those songs and costumes are to die for.  Its like a party on two discs.  This edition shows live performances from its run at midnight shows, dancing instructions and so much more!  Once more its recorded in THX so it really can annoy your neighbors.  If you can't find this edition, then buy the cheaper one and party on.  Can you believe that Susan Sarandon did this film?  I don't think she can either.  Toucha, toucha, toucha me I wanna be dirty!
B0002F6BRE|3.0|This DVD has great graphic menus, but the navigation to get to the special features is horrible!  I wasted about 30 minutes trying to find the special features (deleted scenes and several behind the scene documentaries), then finally, I found out how after having to research on the Web.... <br /> <br />On the first disc, you need to select \\"Infinifilm\\", then click the arrow below the Infinifilm's main options.  On that page are two options: \\"Beyond the Movie\\" and \\"All Access\\" (deleted scenes and documenatries).  Click on either to access the special features and documentaries.  Pretty lame, eh?  But the features are pretty good, and hopefully I saved you some time, cuz I sure wasted lots! <br />
0767817710|4.0|Director Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, Spiderman) made an impressive departure from horror in this old fashioned spagetti western with an impressive (yet virtually unknown) cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Sharon Stone (lead actor at the time, boy has time changed!) and the ever so western bad dude Gene Hackman.   <br /> <br />There's not much difference between a horror film and a western really.  Usually there is more killins in a western.  Raimi skillfully uses his many techniques and quirky camera work to redifine the western.  Not destined to become a classic, but can hold its own.  Well acted and filmed, great score, and loads of action.  If you are a western fan, then this one should not be missed.  If yoy are a Sam Raimi fan, you need this one for your collection.
B000002JNJ|5.0|One of the greatest metal bands to come out of the state of Texas,and one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Ask just about anyone who plays a guitar for a Hardcore/Metalcore or just about any rock and roll band for that matter and 9/10 they will tell u they have borrowed a riff or 2 from \\"Dimebag\\".This album will never fade away. Gods dont die...\\"Dime Lives\\"
B00005JNEI|4.0|Shows that president Bush is a joke, and cannot defend this country if his life depended on it. This movie tells the real reason that Dubya won the damn election in 2000, The simple fact is Bush didnt win Florida, but his cousin was the one to report who won the state, plus his brother is the governor, which has to help, Gore should have one, Its that simple. Bush spent the time ina classroom on 9/11/01, He then found out about the attacks, and said basiclly screw it, Ill remain reading to these kids, while millions of innocent americans are being killed, hes basiclly sayin its not him he doesnt care, and it also shows that only 1 member of the congress has a soldier in Iraq, other than that the poor kids are the only ones there, Moore went around and got 2 thats right TWO people to EVEN listen to him about that, out of all the members of the congress, TWO PEOPLE listened, and only one of those two, slightly agreed, This film shows how Bush is not fit to be president, and how greedy, and careless the repulic really is about the average american, and guess what Bush was re-elected in November of this year, that shows how stupid people can be, Moore made this documentary or film or whatever you call it in hopes of getting Senetor John F. Kerry in office, and showing Bush, you cant fool us again, but sadly it didnt work, anyway check this out, it is very entertaining.
B00005A46T|4.0|Love them or hate them they are todays version of Kiss back in the 70's.This album showcases more of their skills than the first one.The guitar tabs on some of the songs are extremely difficult to try and play and the drum tabs are impossible unless you were born with it.Under all of the some people call \\"noise\\" is straight skill.If you are a deathmetal/rapcore fan their first album along with this one is when they were in there prime. This album really increased their fanbase around the world in my opinon and a good traffic jam headbobber.
B000002IFP|5.0|Great album again from Simply Red. Smooth vocals and smooth melodies. Essential late night listening. <br />Some great tracks including \\" It's only love\\", \\" Love lays it's tune\\" and \\" She'll have to go\\" <br />No bad songs, this just flows smoothly and cleanly through the ears. <br />Beautiful music for most occassions where classiness is required. <br />Simply Red are just simply fantastic!
B0002ZDVF4|5.0|What interests me about this movie is that it's a study in consequences for one's actions, which is true of almost every named character in the film.  Bond kills people left, right and center, with something witty in mind a second afterwards.  He never seems to have any issues with the deaths and property damage for which he is responsible, and his bosses apparently just assume it's a cost of doing business.  Everything feels a lot more real, even if it's not necessarily so.  Agents of the federal government don't always get along and sometimes carry that to a level that hinders their common goal; the bad guys are in it just for the money; no solution really fixes everything that's been broken.  Even if the Central Intelligence Agency does nothing like this, it's as true to life as melodrama gets.    It's not faithful at all to the book of the same name, but as laughable as that book got in places, I doubt the director and screenwriters are crying themselves to sleep knowing how different the film is.  The film lives in a universe it created in the first installment of this series, and it's consistent with that; so, enjoy separately.    The extras are very good, particularly the director's commentary.  It's as good as Liman's for the original, with a lot of technical details and anecdotes about how the shots were framed and edited.  The shorts on staging the car chases and choreographing the fight scenes were good to watch as asides on the making of this film, especially the car chase.  They mean for you to appreciate how hard it is to make these things look natural, and it's gee-whiz fun for people who get into the movie enough to want to know how it was done.    I don't think it's some tremendous character study or anything, but this movie should suit action-movie fans who like to see a streak of intelligence in their heroes, just like the first.  If you watched the first movie and were impressed with the character details, you will enjoy this movie, particularlywith the fleshing-out of Brian Cox's character from the original and the personality clashes between him and Joan Allen.  It's unnecessary to watch Bourne Identity first to appreciate this movie, but it's rewarding to see the continuity between them.
B000002GXX|5.0|Hi there, thanks for reading my review. <br />This is my favourite all-time Eagles album. <br />The fourth and much less commercial than it's huge successor \\" Hotel California\\" <br />This was guitarist Bearnie Leadons last album. This was the best Eagles line-up in my opinion, just the right balance of country/ pop/ rock blend, with smooth singing, great melodies and clever lyrics. <br />The title track is my all time favourite Eagles song. What a brilliant song with awesome guitar. Don Henley at his finest. <br />The next track \\" Too many hands\\" also contains some great guitar with Glenn Frey & Don Felder swapping lead at the end of the song. <br />\\" Hollywood waltz\\" is a nice little mellow number, before \\" Journey of the Sourcerer\\" a haunting instrumental by Bearnie. <br />This music was used in the early 80s cult tv show ( and book series ) \\" The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy \\" <br />\\" Lyin eyes\\" quite a famous track now , with smooth singing by Frey is next. <br />\\" Take it to the limit\\" is probably Randy Meisners, the bass players, most famous song. I love this guys voice, he is the most underrated Eagles singer in my opinion. He has a great high voice. This is the ultimate Eagles song. Driving on the highway, with the sun shining and the windows down, Yeah! <br />\\"Visions\\" is next, another little gem that pops up on nearly every Eagles album. This is the one and only song by guitarist Don Felder. The only song I have found that he sings on. <br />Strange, he didn't have such a bad voice- excellent song, great guiter. <br />\\" After the thrill has gone\\" another typical smooth Eagles track, before ending with \\"I wish you peace\\" a beautiful piece by Bernie Leadon, who left after this album was released. <br />What a great album. <br />Any true Eagles fan would surely love this album. Not quite Hotel Calfornia, not quite country, this is the perfect blend. <br />Mind blowing album cover too- one the best all-time album covers! <br />A terrific album to try the Eagles. <br /> <br />Other great albums by the Eagles:  \\"The Eagles\\" & \\"Hotel California\\" <br /> <br />\\" One of these nights \\" equals: Brilliant music!
B0001LJC2K|3.0|Anyone that can't hear the similarity between Muse and Radiohead is either (1) in denail, and truly unable to see what they don't want to see; (2) completely tone-deaf; or (3) pridefully lying. (Would these people also assert that R. Yamagata sounds nothing like Fiona Apple?) <br /> <br />The harmonic relationships between the instrumental and vocal lines are the most outstanding example of sameness. These harmonies were trademarked by Radiohead; no other band had innovated and consistently used them in the history of rock-music. So the odds that Muse would have convergently composed the same species of harmony in the same decade seems improbable at best.   <br /> <br />And yes, Bellamy uses the falsetto a lot, but it's not the mere *use* of the falsetto that betrays the rip-off. It's *how* Bellamy uses the falsetto that gives it away. He always spikes into it -- from at least an octave below -- and adds a lilt just prior to going there (in a Yorkeian lazy fashion). He also slightly stumbles over the words that fall on the accent -- just like Yorke has pioneered. His mic too must be covered in spit at the end of a gig! <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but like all music critisim, the points are merely academic. If one likes it (and I do), one likes it, no matter the analytical deconstruction. Just don't make the they're-nothing-like-Radiohead argument disingenuously or ignorantly. -- John Lanou.

B000002GYN|5.0|Thanks for reading. <br />I'm surprised reading some reviews that this album receives such poor comments from people. This stuff is brilliant and has awesome songs! <br />As usual the album is a great mix of slower and faster songs. The early line-up was great, albiet missing Don Felder. ( forget about Walsh ) <br />What's remarkable for me is not the hit songs \\" Take it Easy\\" \\"Witchy women\\" and \\" Peaceful Easy Feeling \\" ( which are all wonderful songs ) it's the OTHER songs. Some are just brilliant, including \\" Chug all night\\" <br />\\"Tryin\\" and the best non single ever from the Eagles \\" Take the Devil\\" Mind blowing song from Randy Miesner. <br />Great guitar and melodies as usual. <br />This is my second favourite Eagles album, just pipped by \\" One of these nights\\" <br /> <br />A must for music fans in general. This is GREAT MUSIC!!! <br /> <br />Essential for your collection
B00005JN2Z|3.0|This is an action movie, but it is also a great story.  Most of the movie takes place in or near the Taxi Cab.   <br /> <br />Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as Vincent, the contract hit man.  He pulls off this character with the skill and confidence of a great actor.  In addition, he must have had some excellent technical trainers, because he displays some outstanding combat shooting techniques.  His confrontation with the two goblins in the alley who had just robbed Jamie Fox is worth replaying a couple of times on slow motion. <br /> <br />Jamie Fox also shines as the Taxi driver.  His transformation through the movie kept my interest going until the end.   <br /> <br />A really good movie that is worth watching and buying.
B000002KGT|5.0|Thanks for reading. <br />I never tire of this classic. Like a brilliant moment in history came this late 70s masterpiece. <br />Most people who don't know the band well will surely recognize at least one song, they are instantly recognizable. <br />The creative juices were flowing overtime when they made this. <br />\\" Dreams\\" is mind blowing. \\"Don't stop\\" is so catchy. <br />\\" Song bird \\" is haunting. <br />\\" \\" You make loving fun\\" is pure driving pleasure... <br />This album is indeed a rarity, a perfect mix of brilliant songs. <br />I've been listening to this since I was six years old. <br />Great real music, the way it was meant to be made. <br />Treat yourself to some brilliance if you don't have it!! <br /> <br />Essential for anyones music collection! <br /> <br />ENJOY THIS!
2020090791|5.0|I've read this book several times. On my own most of the times but also as a compulsory assignment not by one but 2 different French teachers. It is short to read but truly impressive.  <br />It depicts two young twin brothers raised by their grandmother in an east european country at the end of a war (WWII)and how they manage to learn and live through horrible events. It is the first book of a trilogy (La preuve & Le troisime mensonge) but I have to admit that they are not as good (the last one is painful...) and you do not need to read them at all to enjoy this one as they are totally different stories. You will forever remember where you were when you finish this novel as it is very powerful. I can't really comment on the English version but I know the novel was translated (The Notebook)
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors were so different when they started. They really burst on the scene when this beauty was released. <br />Not a bad track, not even a mediocre track. <br />First heard this at a party when I was 16 in the late 80s. Will never forget the impact it made. <br />I'll forever remember strobe lights when I hear \\" Light my fire \\" and \\" Break on Through\\" <br />A pity they didn't sustain their career until LA woman. <br />Great album, great memories. <br />As one reviewer said- this is expensive fine wine that gets better- but much cheaper to buy!
B00005JNDX|2.0|Tours of duty in \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Cold Mountain\\" have moved Renee Zellweger past the Bridget Jones character, and it shows on her moony, perturbed face in \\"The Edge of Reason.\\" It's a sequel of absurd slapstick - in contrast to the mannered comedy of the original \\"Diary,\\"  -  and sitcom trappings need jolts of inspired whimsy. But Hugh Grant drops by for a only cup of coffee and Colin Firth, as the constipated Marc Darcy, wraps himself in even more discomfort than he did in \\"Diary.\\"  <br /> <br />That leaves Zellweger, who grinned and cried and stuffed herself into max support bras with zeal her first go round, earning nominations and perverse recognition for size swapping. Now, it's paycheck time, and little more, and no wonder Zellweger shed her chunky monkey physique so quickly post-production: She plays one miserable character. This is not the Jones you'd want to know. <br /> <br />Director Beeban Kidron has designed \\"Edge of Reason\\" to make Bridget not a heroine but a lightning rod of unappealing, embarrassing sequences - in a pig slop, at Marc's lawyer ball, on the ski slopes, in, yes, a Thai prison (where the girls shrug off their communal, disease-ridden existence for an impromptu rendition of Madonna's \\"Like A Virgin.\\")  <br /> <br />What was it again that was so special about Ms. Jones? Is staring at someone as they sleep really that endearing a trait? How about suffering three increasingly annoying, meddling friends? Kidron seems to have forgotten Bridget's plucky cuteness - there isn't one scene in \\"Edge of Reason\\" where Zellweger is allowed to look, well, attractive for very long without being drenched or slopped or having her hair ruined.   <br />
B000002I2M|4.0|Well Jim finally got it together to record the most decent Doors stuff since the superb debut masterpeice. I doubt the Doors would be as popular as they were if it wasn't for this great last album. <br />Most stuff has already been said in the reviews, I'll just add it's great driving or mellowing out music. <br />An absolute must for Doors fans! <br />
B000002A46|5.0|How could anyone not like this CD?  Even if you're not a Mariah Carey fan, you have to admit she is one of the best artists that ever lived.  The songs she writes, composes, and sings put her in a league of her own.  What other artist has consistently written or co-written so many hit singles?  The fact that she does a tremendous job covering the traditional Christmas songs is only half of it.  She penned the instantly memorable and virtually unforgettable original classic song \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" which, alone, is reason enough to buy this CD.  She also wrote two more songs, and I must also say that \\"Jesus Born On This Day\\" is a masterpiece in itself.  Mariah was definitely on the top of her game when she recorded this CD, and there is a reason this is a top seller year after year.  I honestly can't think of one track on this CD that I skip over.  I only wish she would would release a new Christmas CD with more classics.  Mariah is an amazing artist that has brought us a long string of hit songs that are now classics, and with this CD, she gives us the amazingly perfectly sung and composed masterpiece \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\".  What an amazing talent this artist is.  No other artist has come out with a Christmas CD that even remotely comes close to this perfect work of art.  All I Want for Christmas is this CD!!!
B00008DDXC|5.0|Thanks for reading. <br />This movie really captured the spirit of the book, in much the same way as the first movie did. <br />Barely anything was left out, and as usual the sets, costumes and casting was top notch. Is there any better cast in recent times than Alan Rickman as Snape? Superb!!! He is awesome. <br />The magic has been captured superbly on the screen, and I love the character development. <br />The movie lends itself well to the small screen. <br />Most poeple already know the plot, so I won't say too much , except that if you have been living in a time capsule for the last few years- treat yourself to an experience by trying a Harry Potter book or movie. They really are wonderful for children and adults alike. <br />

B00003CXI1|5.0|This captures the books charm, excitement and magic perfectly. <br />A wonderful cast and beautiful costumes and sets set the tone for Harry as he discovers he's a wizard and goes of to Hogwarts. <br />A wonderful movie for children and adults alike. <br />Best line ( which wasn't in the book by the way ) <br />As Hagrid crashed through the door to first meet Harry. <br />\\" SORRY \\"BOUT THAAAAAT! \\" <br />A classic. <br />Love Alan Rickman as Snape, and Maggie Smith is simply delightful as MacGonagall. <br />The late, great Richard Harris is superb as Dumbledore. <br />This is a special treat. <br />Enjoy! <br />
B0000028VT|5.0|This album is a masterpiece.  As much as I love the brilliantly constructed Dreamlover and Hero, which both became instant classics upon release, the standout for me is \\"Without You\\".  What an amazing amazing job she did on this number.  Truly one of her best performances in her long successful career.  After hearing Mariah sing this song, there is no way I could listen to anyone else sing it.  What a perfectly flawless cover.  Filled with mainly ballads, nearly every song on this CD is listenable over and over.  Anytime You Need A Friend is ok.  I didn't like it for a long time, but it has grown on me.  I wouldn't have chosen it for a single release though.  I must say that the live version from her 1994 concert on DVD/VHS is the version I prefer by far.  It makes the song shine.  I'd recommend this CD to anyone based on the perfectly sung and composed Dreamlover, Hero, and Without You.  Mariah and Walter are a hitmaking team.  ALL of their collaborations are successful masterpieces.
B000002GYW|4.0|The follow up to their first album, was an unusual choice. The songs however are so good. Like all their albums, contains some less well know gems.  I really loved \\" Out of control\\", \\"Certain kind of fool\\" \\" Outlaw man \\" and of course the classic \\" Desperado\\"  A good mix of tracks, nothing really bad, never skip anything when I play it.. always a good sign in an album.  A must for Eagles fans.  Worth a listen for country/ rock fans too.
B000002AVF|5.0|I think this is a great album.  The best cuts are Fantasy, Melt Away, Always Be My Baby, and Forever.  Of course One Sweet Day is a great track too, but Forever is one of the best Mariah Carey records I've ever heard.  I highly recommend this album to anyone.  As much as I don't care for her remakes (except the beautiful and unbelievably flawless performance she gave on \\"Without You\\", a truly stellar moment), Open Arms isn't too bad.  But she clearly shines on her own material, and that is why Mariah Carey will be around \\"FOREVER\\".
B000002B1M|4.0|It Was Written, a great change in hip hop in the mid 90's.Some say that rap is poetry with a rhythm.Well if you listen to Nas' it was written you will probaby agree on what some say.The incredible flow on tracks such as Nas is comin' and the set up really tell you what Nas is: an urban poet with a rap twist.I personally enjoy tracks like watch dem niggas and the set up.It was yet a stupendous follow up of Nas' classic album: Illmatic. <br />The intellegent way Nas uses to express his street knowledge through rhyming is amazing. And there will never quite be another rapper like Nas. Here are some of my perspectives of the songs on it was written.: <br /> <br />1- an intro, it was ok <br />2- 7/10 <br />3-9/10 <br />4-10/10 <br />5-10/10 <br />6-8/10 <br />7-10/10 <br />8-6/10( it sounded weird because of the faint strings in the backround it sounded like something my grandmother would waltz to.) <br />9-10/10 (tells a tight story about a drug deal.) <br />10-9/10 (this song lets you know what a single young black female goes through.) <br />11- 8/10 <br />12-10/10 <br />13-7/10 <br />14-10/10 (this song exactly tells you his amazing flow and knowledge about the streets as a teacher would teach you how to add 1+1.)
B0002IVN9W|5.0|this music has the ability to rock out loud AND be really soothing. the last song on their cd, Funeral, sounds a bit like an orchestra portishead with that whole \\"Great Expectations\\" soundtrack flavor. On the other hand, there are also songs with the sounds of U2, the Cars, and Morissey laced within the music. for new listeners who want to check them out, i'd recommend the songs, \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\", \\"No Cars Go\\", and \\"Wake up\\". i'm hooked and absolutely infatuated. absolutely beautiful sounds. <br />
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa is almost legendary in Japan, as it was Hayao Miyazaki's first film.  It often tops lists of Japan's best-remembered films, and for this reason it's been probably the most highly anticipated of all of Miyazaki's back catalog here in the United States.  While it is an excellent animated film in its own right, it is not nearly as refined as Miyazaki's later works, and its political message is both dated and a bit ham-fisted compared with the slightly more subtle approach Miyazaki has taken with later films such as Porco Rosso or Spirited Away. <br /> <br />Nausicaa is a film adaptation of a manga (Japanese graphic novel series) that ran seven volumes over the span of 13 years.  The film itself only covers parts of the first two volumes, and you do get the sense while watching it that you're only seeing a small part of a much larger story.  The duration of the manga also meant that both the politics of the world (which are relayed in allegorical form in the film) had changed during those 13 years, along with Miyazaki's own viewpoint on what he wanted Nausicaa to be.  This makes the film feel a bit more locked into early 1980's real-world politics - as a tale of two warring superpowers who nearly destroy each other with super-weapons - than the more sweeping scope of the original manga. <br /> <br />The end result is a film that shows great promise on the part of its director, but that feels a bit incomplete and that hasn't aged as gracefully as some of Miyazaki's other films.  It's a film that's remembered in Japan as a landmark - and it was, in 1984 - but out of its original context and when compared to Miyazaki's later work, it just does not hold up quite as well. <br /> <br />Worth seeing, and of course a must-own for any Miyazaki collector.  But not his best film, despite its reputation.
6304806426|1.0|This is a \\"Chick Flick\\" from beginning to end.  It's not an epic - it's a 3-hour soap opera!  Watching \\"The English Patient\\" was like opening a jar of caviar only to find a swarm of ants embedded in a carmelized lump of corn syrup... I hated it!
B000099T3P|5.0|The one word to sum up this movie is FUN. This is an instant classic, no doubt about it.  <br /> <br />I'm sure by now everyone knows the plot. Almost like \\"Deadly Spawn\\" but these creatures have hair. Space Alien Creature fur ball things come to earth and begin to fest on humans. Alien hunters come to stop them and the town drunk gets to be the hero. Nuf said! <br /> <br />The idea for the \\"Critter\\" is quite ingenious. You have an animal about the size of a basketball, covered in long fur, rows upon rows of razor sharp teeth, feet and hands when they want to extend them, poison tipped needles on their back that can be shot at victims, and they are also quite humorous.  <br /> <br />This is probably the best one in the series but part 2 gives it a run for its money. Part 3 & 4, to me, just fell a little short but they are all extremly fun to watch. But the best scene of course is in part 2 when all the critters combine into 1 huge ball and roll over people. Classic!!! <br /> <br />Anywho, buy this DvD if your looking for a fun movie to watch!
B000063JDE|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I have learned to appreciate its style and emotional impact. In short, innocence(Kyle McClauchlin and Laura Dern) encounters the darker side of life (Isabella Rosellini and Dennis Hopper} in the small and happy town of Lumberton where nothing ever happens until... It has a great plot with standout performances by all, especially an almost kabuki type performance by Dennis Hopper..enough to make you cringe and keep watching at the same time. Its almost unbearable at times especially when he takes an unsuspecting Kyle McClauchlin for a ride. Soon we find out a perfect happy world it is not. A great tribute to film noir at times with a hint of surrealism.
B000002H33|1.0|This could be one of the worst records ever released.  The guitars and bass sound more like chainsaws than musical instruments.  The drums sound like some one breaking cement with a jackhammer.   <br /> <br />And the vocals...James Hetfield sounds like a horse grunting.  Not to mention that he also looks like one.  You can tell how bad Mulletallica is when their greatest artistic acheivement is having the most horselike hairstyle!   <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.  There are lots of bands out there better than this one.  Mulletallica is for retarded red.necks who think that whatever band has the biggest mullets makes the best music.   <br /> <br />Mulletallica is by far the worst band of the late 80s/early 90s.  Even the manufactured pop bands like New Kids on the Block or MC Hammer that existed around the same time were more tolerable than Mulletallica.
B000060MWU|4.0|Okay, I know this one is way out there. Trying to decipher what its all about is an exercise in futility for us common people. Let the brainiacs figure that out and enjoy this one for its surreal images and masterful choreography. I don't understand the plot but I still love this movie. I don't know if that is possible, but when watching most of DL movies you've got to learn to enjoy it for what it offers: emotional and stunning visuals.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Wow.  After reading all of the rave reviews by the critics and the accolades of others who had seen this movie, I though that I was in for a real treat.  This was not so, however, and I found myself tired and bored out of my mind.  I guess I just can't connect to the humor in this movie about being stuck in a different country, but to relate one would have to first find the humor.  I don't suggest buying this if you haven't seen it already.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I use to hate David Lynch movies because I didn't understand them ,but I have grown to appreciate there style and artistic flare. It's hard to explain a movie with such adversity and emotional impact. All I can say is throw the plot out of the window and enjoy DL at his most surreal best since Lost Highway (another one Ive grown to love.) Outstanding performances. Interesting dialogue and just downright weird but somehow manages to maintain a high emotional impact.. Hard to explain...Rent the DVD and watch this one more than once. I didn't like it on the first viewing but watched again and again and learned to appreciate its dreamlike quality. Impacted even more by Angelo Bandalmenti's music who also plays a mob boss who is picky about his coffee. This movie is hynotizing and very intriguing but definitely keep an open mind while viewing. Not one for the kiddies or Grandma.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I am thirteen and a half, and i want to let everybody know that this album STILL rocks!  You may have read the other reviews by now that say \\"this song is great!\\". im not going to do that because... well, they are all great!  My favorite song on the album is Disarm because when i was little my dad would play it and tell me what they were singing about (although now that i am older i forgot it ;-)  This album comes a little bit over my like of MCATIS, which is regaurded by most SP fans their best album.  This one has harder riffs and doesnt make you need to skip a few of the boring songs, because every single one of them is highly enjoyable.  This CD is a GREAT buy for any fan of Nirvana, Smashing Pumkins, or 90's rock.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Although I wasn't crazy about the album's first single \\"American Idiot\\", I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Green Day's albums since \\"Dookie\\", so I was pretty sure I'd like this one too and bought it the day of it's release.  Once again, I wasn't disappointed.  This could very well be Green Day's best album to date.  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is the first of two rock operas, composed of five mini-songs combined into one big song...amazing.  \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", has always been my favorite song on the album and is now the album's second single...just a beautiful song with great lyrics.  \\"Homecoming\\", the album's second rock opera song, is even better than the first...it doesn't get much better than this.  There really isn't any filler material to be found on throughout the whole album.  \\"American Idiot\\" is in my opinion, one of the best rock albums of 2004.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This film has everything, great horror icons, great effects, loads of action and the fighting scenes are amazing, a top notch movie, a great horror/adventure
B00008NG5V|5.0|This album is very relaxing and easy to listen to.  The lyrics are great and the music helps your mind drift.  A few members on the official Marcy Playground message board recommended Jack to me awhile back.  After downloading many of his songs and loving them to death, I decided it was time I went out and gave Jack Johnson some of my money.  This is some great stuff folks!
B00006FDCD|2.0|The best thing about this movie is Tim Curry. The worst thing about this movie is everything else. No, that's not true, it's an innocuous movie that will leave you as you were - nothing added, nothing taken away. I only hate it (more like hate myself) because I bought a copy of the movie rather than rent it or borrow from a friend. Now, it's in my collection. <br />As I can remember, it's about a group of kids who once drove away Pennywise, a small-town clown who kills other kids. All of them, except for one black guy, has since left the small town. When the killing resumes, the black guy tracks down all the other members of the group, so that they can play heroes once again. <br />I must have passed out and when I came to, the movie is over. Even Tim Curry can't resurrect a dead concept.
0140177396|5.0|A simply splendid book that is captivating and a delgiht for all ages. It tells of the friendship of two men, and how they depend on each other to survive. It is a brilliant story with a sad ending. I guarentee you'll love this book or your money back.... well not really but you catch my drift. A wonderful read!
B000062YB1|5.0|This album lacks the thrash element of earlier slayer discs, but it will still keep you hooked the whole way through.  Cleaned up vocals, with brillant riffs, keep slayer at the top of metal.  It is slower than Show no Mercy and Reign in Blood, but it is still worth checking out.  Th song War ensemble is the most thrash like on this album.  Dead Skin Mask, Skeletons of Society, temptation, and Seasons in the Abyss are the best on here.
B0000542D2|5.0|I don't know if Mr. Cranky is for real of if this is supposed to be humor. If it's humor, it's about as stale as the line that some people cling on to: \\"did you know that Paul McCartney was in a different band before Wings?\\" <br />   I don't have anything to compare other than my VHS copies (1988 and 1998 versions, I think). What I'm going by is the film itself, which I saw for the first time when I was 11. It came on TV, and it was the first time I remember being glued to the set and cursing the commercials to be over and the program to resume. I am also going by my feeling that there is no rock and roll movie better than this. The Kids Are Alright is a great film as well, but that's more of a documentary. <br />   A Hard Day's Night captures John, Paul, George, and Ringo at the point in their career as Beatles when they were so busy and frantic that they didn't have time to pose or fake anything. What you see is natural charm, and a magic of film making. And this is the amazing thing, because it was directed by Dick Lester, the same director of Cuba, one of the worst films I have ever seen - it ranks right in there with the flat acting in The Flamingo kid. <br />   A Hard Day's Night is the reason why all the films about the Beatles fail. It is absurd to try and recreate any performance scene, because the Beatles were an aberration. The excitement was real, the talent was difficult to match, their humor was fairly natural, and their charm went hand in hand with an excellent script. <br />   If you're serious about music, and you have an understanding that rock and roll is about angst, energy, rebellion, and fun as well, then you'll appreciate this film as the classic that it is. If not, then maybe West Side Story is more your speed.
B000062YAZ|5.0|What can you say other than brillant.  This is slayer, of course it is great.  Reign in Blood is prehapes the greatest album of all time.  Supersonic thrash with satanic lyrics.  I love it.  This is the album that put thrash on the map, and it has always been the anthem for thrash. <br />Trust me, you can't go worng with this one.   <br /> <br />Angel of Death***** <br />Piece by Piece***** <br />Necrophobic**** <br />Altar of Sacrifice (tied with raining blood for #1)***** <br />Jesus Saves***** <br />Criminally Insane***** <br />Reborn**** <br />Epidemic**** <br />Postmortem**** <br />Raining blood***** <br />agressive Prefector**** <br />Criminally insane (remix)**** <br />
0316666343|4.0|From the beginning, I loved this book. The perspective was fascinating and I liked the honest way Sebold dealt with the rape of the young girl and her family's struggle to survive after her death. The emotions were honest and true, and it was nice to have the characters so fleshed out.<br /><br />However, I had a problem when it came to the end. Like another reviewer commented, she just suddenly dropped down to earth to have sex? It was almost like this scene was thrown in as an afterthought when Sebold couldn't think of another way for the girl to find closure.<br /><br />In her previous memoir, LUCKY, Sebold detailed the agonizing years it took for her to gain closure from her own brutal rape and it seemed like the last part of THE LOVELY BONES was an attempt to force similar closure on the part of the heroine.<br /><br />I would definitely read other books by Sebold, however. Her writing style is great.
B00004W52U|5.0|This album, along with their other albums, is great. From beginning to end, you can't skip a song or the Song Skipping Fairy will find you and beat your eyeballs out of your sockets with her 12 inch Skipping Song Rod (The John Holmes model). \\"Unity\\", \\"Take Warning\\", \\"Missionary\\", \\"Bad Town\\", \\"Big City\\", and \\"Caution\\" are punk/ska classics that shouldn't be passed up or missed out on. Not listening to these songs or this band and listening to punk music is like not believing in God and saying you are Christian. It just doesn't add up. Op Ivy is and was a great band. Can we expect a reunion tour anytime soon? I hope for punk's sake, no. That would be terrible.
B00005JNLY|3.0|Spanglish is a good movie when it is about John Claskey and Flor, his Mexican imigrant housekeeper, played by Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  John and Flor both have young teenage daughters and they are interesting as well.  John has a son who is on screen some but mostly goes unnoticed.  John also has a mother-in-law with a drinking problem who has a few good moments.<br /><br />But unfortunately, director James Brooks has created one of the most evil, unsympathetic characters ever in John's wife, Deborah, played well by Tea Leoni.  I don't fault Leoni because she is utterly convincing as the despicable, selfish, clueless, adulterous Deborah.  She is mean to her daughter, her husband and to especially Flor, the housekeeper she hired.  Deborah doesn't have one redeeming quality which the viewer can latch on to.  There is no reason to care about her.  Even at the end of the movie when she does perhaps see the error of her ways, it doesn't change the fact that she is a horrible person and it doesn't make up for all the evil she did to her family.<br /><br />The reason to watch this movie is Adam Sandler and Paz Vega.  Their chemistry together is fresh and exciting and one leaves the theater knowing these two were made for each other.  I read one review about Spanglish that said the movie isn't very good, but it does have interesting characters.  It could have been a good movie if Brooks hadn't made Tea Leoni's character so utterly unsympathetic and repulsive.  Still, Sander shows he can act without being his traditional silly self and Vega is a newcomer to America who is absolutely beautiful to watch.
0380789035|5.0|Amazing book. My first of Neil Geiman. Long have I heard of his legacy but then I also heard that he was somewhat overrated. Not in this case. I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up the book and I did so solely because of a good review. It turned out to be just the kind of thing that I love - the past and the present, the myth and the facts, the evil and the good, the real and the surreal rolled into one giant, wild ball that takes you on a fantastic downhill ride. You have to know your history, you have to know a bit about mythology and  you have to let go of rationality to enjoy this one. Very well written, fluent and delightful to read. Yes, there are cases when the most rational reader will raise an eyebrow and find the given events too absurd for a good, logical book, but if you take the whole thing as a fantasy journey and assume the logic of dreams instead of the logic of the waking world, it fits like a glove. Not a simple, action packed thriller, by all means! Buy it only if you have enough patience to try to see what lurks beneath the surface of the apparent words.<br /><br />Similar and yet different to this one, is \\"Lord of Light\\" by Roger Zelazny. Actually there is not much of a similarity except the ingenius work at hand and the tackling of the concept of gods and how it would be if we assumed them to be less perfect than what they are said to be. It is an immensely good book and I recommend it to everyone who has enjoyed American Gods.
B000002HMH|4.0|This is the last GOOD Metallica album.  Metallica was in the stratosphere from the Kill Em All to Black Album era.  Metallica's prime...anybody would know that.  But Load is a &quot;good&quot; not &quot;great&quot; CD like the previous 5.  Yes, I'll be the first to admit this sounded way off track the first time I listened to it.  Give it a chance though.  &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot; is a great song with great lyrics.  And by the way, keep faith in Metallica.  They played about three weeks ago at the Fleetcenter in Boston.  No songs from Load....no songs from Reload....no songs from St. Anger(duh).  All Master Of Puppets, Justice For All, Ride The Lightning, Kill Em All, and Black Album.  They will be on the rise in 2005.
B00005JNLY|3.0|The plot of SPANGLISH has been described as \\"the story of a Mexican woman and her daughter who travel all the way to Los Angeles to bring sanity to a crazy Anglo family.\\" Right. That's like defining World War II as a minor squabble that discomfited Europe and the Far East.<br /><br />The gorgeous Spanish (as in Spain) actress Paz Vega makes her American screen debut as Flor, who, with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), travel up from Mexico to SoCal for the employment opportunities. (Whether they're \\"documented\\" or not is, in this politically correct age, left to the imagination.) Though she speaks no English, Flor lands a job as a housekeeper with the well-to-do Clasky family, which includes the Mister, John (Adam Sandler), the Missus, Deborah (Tea Leoni), daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele), and Deborah's resident, alcoholic mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). There's also a Clasky son, but his role is so minor as to go virtually unnoticed. When necessary, Cristina, who speaks English like a native, translates for her Mom. There must be wonderful language schools for the economically challenged south of the border.<br /><br />Flor, whose role eventually evolves to live-in maid as the household migrates from Beverly Hills to a rented Malibu beach house for the summer, stumbles into a tense situation. Deborah is unsatisfied with her marriage. John, owner/#1 chef of a four-star restaurant, is Mr. Nice Guy without a clue. Deborah has an awkward relationship with Bernice, who, overweight and with dental braces, doesn't meet Mom's expectations; Deborah seemingly has no relationship with her son at all, good or bad; Deborah disapproves of Evelyn's constant drinking. Deborah spends her time running to keep in shape and satisfy some inner concept of self image. Come to think of it, Deborah doesn't do much of anything. The plot's conflict emerges as Deborah begins to treat the perfect Cristina as her own daughter without Flor's permission, e.g., having their hair highlighted together, and getting Cristina enrolled in a prestigious private school. In the meantime, John is rendered incoherent by Flor's beauty and warmth, but, being a decent fellow, he doesn't do anything about it that might otherwise be expected of a male with normal hormone levels.<br /><br />Superficially, SPANGLISH has appeal. Deborah remains engaging even as she verges on Total Bitch. (OK, ok. I think Tea Leoni is a Hottie.) And there are some genuinely funny moments, as when Cristina translates an overwrought outburst by Flor, complete with vigorous hand and arm waving, and when Evelyn sobers up and tells her daughter to snap out of it. My biggest problem is with Paz Vega as Flor. She's truly eye candy I can appreciate, but I think the producers of the film want the audience to react to her as did the stupefied John, i.e., assign her a separate gender altogether based on looks. When Flor and Cristina walk off into the California sunset at the film's conclusion, all the difficulties back at the Clasky house are left unresolved. Indeed, the resentment that Bernice felt for having her place in Mom's affections co-opted by Cristine was never even dealt with. So, what was all this except a beauty contest with Vega as the preordained winner?<br /><br />While I'm allowing for the fact that the point of the film was perhaps to introduce Paz to American audiences, I still felt manipulated more than the norm by the scriptwriters. If you want to see a substantive role in current release by an acknowledged screen beauty, see CLOSER starring Julia Roberts. Granted, it's not a comedy, or even something for the whole family, but at least it's not fluff masquerading as a movie with a message.ted together, and getting Cristina enrolled in a prestigious private school.

B00005JNLY|2.0|The problem with SPANGLISH is that it doesn't seem to know which characters it's really \\"about.\\" The film can't decide whether the Klasky family is its focus or if the focus is their maid Flor, played by the beautiful Paz Vega.<br /><br />Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni play a successful couple with a bad marriage.<br /><br />Sandler plays his character as a charming but befuddled doormat who only occasionally asserts himself, though he never does that with his wife.<br /><br />Deb Klasky, Leoni's character, is a particularly unpleasant character. She's horribly insensitive, totally neurotic and makes some awful, awful choices. And then, for some reason, the film offers her character no ending whatsoever.<br /><br />I was waiting for there to be some resolution. I wanted to know what happened to the Klasky marriage. I wanted to know where the movie went from its central confrontation.<br /><br />But nothing happened.<br /><br />I don't know why the movie can't be about both Flor AND the Klaskys - giving all the plots a proper resolution, but director James L. Brooks apparently thinks, at different points in the film, that it's about one set of characters or the other.<br /><br />So we're left with some characters that get no definition at all (the Klaskys have a son who gets almost no screen time), some plotlines that are just left dangling (when does the young girl stand up to her mother?) and some confrontations that the movie seems to build toward that just never happen (Deb and Flor should have one more conversation).<br /><br />Also, the movie is told by a narrator who CAN'T know all the things the movie is telling us.<br /><br />On my way out of the theater after SPANGLISH, I heard one woman tell another that they liked it and liked, most of all, that it didn't have a traditional \\"Hollywood ending.\\"<br /><br />I found it uneven, and I found its ending a cheat.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I was impressed by this DVD. Of course, every commentary about art and artistic performances has to be subjective. Is a matter of taste. What is thrilling for me is boring for someone else.    This DVD includes comments by director/producer Michael Mann in the first of two disks. Contrary to what is customary, you can read a highlighted text. His remarks are intelligent and show to what degree of professionalism he and his actors were committed. Extraordinary.    Tom Cruise is an actor that has surprised me over and over. He is a master of his art. Not only that, he prepares each character in a complete and perfect way. As an example, he trained under the guidance of experts while learning to shoot. So what, you say? So did thousands of other actors. Well, maybe so, but Tom Cruise is one of the few who mastered the craft. He does not blink when he shoots, and that is the brand of the expert. Oh, by the way, Schwarzenegger blinks...    Jamie Foxx shows a wide range of expression in this movie and I expect him to offer us some serious performances in the future. For some reason, comedians are very good in dramatic roles.    All in all, this is a movie not to be forgotten. It will stick in your mind.
B0000AYL17|5.0|When we built our new home last year we installed a surround system on the living room set.  Like an idiot I've purchased about 30 of these discs so I have something to listen to on it.  There are alot of suround discs with minor alterations from the stereo versions that don't yield very extraordinary results. <br /> <br />This disc is by far the best use of the suround technology.  It opens the music up, allowing each instrument to be heard without competition and the resut is glorious. <br />What is more, the music lacks a center point so the sound sounds good all over the room, not just in one chair. <br /> <br /> More SACD producers should take cues from the great production evident on this album.  SACD would have a real future if all released were this good. Please, more Steely Dan please sir.

You'll fall asleep faster.<br /><br />This movie is for people who like depressing stories about being alone and alienated in Japan.  If that's your bag, then maybe you'll be able to stay awake and watch this movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This show is simply stellar. <br /> <br />Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are absolutely fantastic as the two (very difficult) leading roles in this amazing show. Idina, as the fiery, emerald-skinned Elphaba, shines in her show-stopping numbers that stud this beautifully written show. Her big, brassy belt brings jaw-dropping life to brilliant songs like \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"No Good Deed.\\" Chenoweth also is amazing, playing Glinda the Good with a quirky, Legally Blonde-esque air and a gorgeous operatic soprano voice that sears through the ensemble numbers like \\"No One Mourns The Wicked\\" and \\"Thank Goodness.\\" She also makes quite a statement in a of her own, namely in the cutesy pop hit \\"Popular\\" and later with Idina in \\"For Good.\\" <br /> <br />Though some may claim that the music is a little awkward or stilts the story, this show is a captivating, character-driven masterpiece. The dramatic instrumental score, touching lyrics and (of course) amazing vocals is enough to make this a Broadway gem for years to come.
B00006GFAB|3.0|This is a good album with a lot of classic cuts but I do believe I have seen this album before.  Maybe, I think it was called Double Platinum.  That album and several other called 'best of' I have sampled.  Obviously there are people buying these things but I won't count myself among their number, at least not anymore.  Two 'best of' albums is enough for me to own, thank you very much.  Good day to you.
B00009Y3L4|1.0|As other reviewers have noted, Warner stated that this print was enhanced for widescreen TVs ... and it's not.  Later packaging of this edition does not say that, but why the heck can't Warner get it right?  I am so angry at them for this. <br /> <br />Cheapskates.
B00018D3JQ|5.0|Doing a cover is very hard because of the consequences and critics will bash your music, but this album....its very good! My fave tracks..Love will tear us apart (magnificent!) and The Guns of Brixton. I've been listening to the cd for weeks now. If you like eclectic downtempo music, then this cd is a must have.
B00006JMQG|5.0|I am at a loss why some are reviewing the Image Entertainment version when the KINO INTERNATIONAL VERSION is the one listed above.  The Kino print is wonderfully clear and very sharp with excellent detail...there are some specks left here and there but this in no way detracts from the enjoyment.  The intertitles are a bit on the slow side, but at last you can read them.   <br /> <br />I really have little to say that hasn't gone on before except this is a superb silent film with an incredibly delicious plot twist at the end...Very dark cinema and excellent soundtrack as well!  <br /> <br />Bravo KINO!!!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|One of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year, Collateral is a thrilling movie that doesn't exhibit any thriller cliches. This is a movie that prefers building an atmosphere of dread over using shock tactics, dialogue over violence, and atmosphere over frantic chases, and it still manages to be an incredibly engaging film. Of all the movies I saw this year, I will admit this to be among my favorites, and I am a bit of a film snob. <br /> <br />The thrust of the story concerns Tom Cruise's salt-and-pepper-haired hitman Vincent and Jamie Foxx's uber-professional cabbie Max. Credit where credit is due, Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett-Smith both make very strong impressions in minor roles. This movie, however, is all about Vince and Max. Mann's use of striking imagery and perpetual darkness turn Los Angeles into a dark, almost mystical locale, and the mood is perfectly set for what follows. Max, of course, picks up Vincent at the airport and ferries him around the city of angels at gunpoint in order to off witnesses in a drug case. Max, you see, is intent on moving on to better things, but although he is a staunch professional, you get the sense that he's never going to get enough traction to move out of where he is. Ironically, Vincent provides the impetus he needs to move out of his corner, if he survives the night. Both the leads turn in what could be called the best performances of their careers: the suave, frigid Vincent is the role Cruise was born to play. He really gets into it here, and like his best performances, he gets to be cruel and edgy. Foxx is very moving in the film, endowing Max with great humanity. Overall, this is a hardly conventional and very enjoyable movie that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an intriguing character study and an invigorating film.
B000669GAI|4.0|For years I've listened to the radio and said \\"Damn, this is a cool Pearl Jam song!\\", but then I've always happened to miss what bloody song it is! <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder's unique voice is always there to let you know what band you're listening to, but - with no disrespect intended - you can't understand a word he's saying most of the time! Personally, I dont care what he's saying because his voice makes another instrument in my ears and makes for some damn great listenin'! <br /> <br />This album is long overdue for me, and now I like knowing the titles of all those songs I've heard on the radio ('Jeremy' and 'Dissendent') and then some more that I haven't heard before that are equally great ('Black'!!!). If you're a die-had Pearl Jam fan, then I see why you'd buy this since you probably have all the albums. But for casual fans like me, it's a great overview...or should I say rearview?
B000002JSP|2.0|Maybe if Zepplin had proped up that drunk of a drummer he wouldn't have choked on his own vomit and they would have been around a little longer. Then they could have put on some make up of their own and and really showed everyone who's boss...nah...another band that was alot better had already done that. Im glad that good old J.D. let everyone know how Zepplin got around to deciding how they should go about doing their albums.All you had to do was show up to band practice first! I can see it now....Jones got up early on Christmas morning to discover that Santa had left him a brand new keyboard set.He rushes down as quick as he can and to his amazement he is the first to show up to practice so he gets to have first say on how the album will go.Soon afterwards Bonham gets mad because he thinks its his turn to be first and goes on a drinking binge and........well we all know what happened after that dont we.Get over it.this album sucked back then and it still does today. <br /> <br />
B00003CXB2|3.0|Sand and camels and sand and camels and sand and a horse and, ooh, something happened but I missed it, go back to sleep, dream of sand and camels and sand and camels.
B00005JNEI|3.0|As powerful as this movie is at times, I was disappointed in it's overall presentation. Michael Moore's often buffoonish approach to disarming the objects of his attacks is less effective in this film, mostly due to the seriousness of the subject. I would have preferred that a more intellectual director would have tackled this one. It's pretty easy to make George W. Bush look like a moron: all you need to do is present footage of him talking. I've read a great deal about the Bush family and this movie taught me nothing new (that doesn't mean YOU shouldn't see it though). Furthermore, the fact that Moore casually insinuates conspiracy theories based on a relationship between the Bush family and the bin Ladens is a little obnoxious. Like all Moore films, this movie is a bit chaotic and fails to really stay on target with any sort of statement other than \\"Bush sucks.\\" This is definately entertainment, NOT a thesis backed up by relevant points. One minute the soldiers in Iraq are heroic victims of Bush's policies, and then suddenly later they are portrayed as bloodthirsty meatheads. The movie is all over the place. I prefer more academic \\"documentaries\\" (if you can even call this a documentary). If you are not very aware about current events or politics, this movie might be helpful to you. Otherwise, I would recommend movies like \\"Control Room\\" or \\"Manufacturing Consent\\" (or anything with Noam Chomsky's name on it for that matter). This movie seems counter-productive to the very necessary discussion on the conflicts between Christian and Islamic cultures, the effect of U.S. foreign policy on other countries, and the real roots of terrorism. Films like this are calculated to achieve an emotional response that will stir people up and make money. Certainly there are important points made and I do agree that Bush is an incompetant president, but I am uncomfortable with Moore's overall approach. Still, the movie is very much worth seeing. It includes a lot of footage that you won't see anywhere else very easily. However, the film isn't as good as Moore's \\"Bowling For Columbine,\\" and I predict that in another 10-15 years, people will have forgotten all about \\"Farenheit 911.\\"u won't see anywhere else very easily. However, the film isn't as good as Moore's \\"Bowling For Columbine,\\" and I predict that in another 10-15 years, people will have forgotten all about \\"Farenheit 911.\\"
B000002NC4|5.0|This album is truly great.  They sound like a mix b/t Pavement, Sonic Youth, and Modest Mouse.  Which is great!  Some complain about the lengths of the songs, but I never get a sense of boredom while listening to it.  If you are interested in any of the bands I mentioned, then I would definately purchase this CD.  A great buy!
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie is great! i love it!! its just not the same as the first two. ex.... there is a new dumbledore, new director and not as many of the same things as the other movies. but i still am a huge harry potter fan and i don't dare to give this movie less then five stars!
B000002GQG|5.0|In Search for the Lost Chord was a true classic when it came out in 1968, the beginning of the psychedelic era, when things were magical (ah, youth), and this was definitely the album that matched the spiritual side of that time, along with the 5 albums that followed, up through 7th Sojourn in 1972. <br />The Moodys created a unique sound using classical, pop, folk, and even Indian influences, all enveloped together by Mike Pinder's keyboard and synthesizer work, with Thomas's flute, Lodge's angelic falsetto, and, of course, Hayward's guitar. This was a truly synergistic band, where the whole was definitely much more than its parts added together.  This is when they were were \\"cosmic\\", and every album was like a trip, flowing together in a continuous musical experience from the beginning of the album to the end. <br />After 7th Sojourn (the last song on that album titled \\"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and Roll Band\\"), the band broke up for 5 years and it was never the same. They did some solo work, and Hayward/Lodge did the Blue Jay's album.  But that was basically it for the Moodys. <br />When they came back together for \\"Octave\\", it was the last album the original group did.  After the recording, Pinder left because he didn't want to tour any more.  Hayward hammered out a few commercial hits over time, and he and Lodge basically took over the band, pushing the others out, forming their \\"Gemini Dream\\" ego a deux. <br />In concert they would trot out their \\"best commercial hits\\" parade, playing each separate song exactly as on the recording, lacking any warmth and spontaneity.  They truly wanted to be \\"Just a Singer in a Rock and Roll Band\\", but as a \\"rock\\" group the Moodys suck big time.  Ray Thomas, the second best songwriter of the group, was limited in concerts to only 2 songs a set.  No Pinder songs were and are played and, of course, his sound is entirely missing.  They may as well change the band name to the \\"We Love Ourselves: the Hayward/Lodge Experience.\\" <br />What they created back then was truly magical, a musical psychedelic spiritual journey that was often inspiring and uplifting.  I guess we should be glad that it ever existed, for such a short yet wonderful time. <br />
B00002Z88D|4.0|I heard about the CD, and was instantly motivated to hear the music.  A collision of Heavy Metal and symphony?  After being a fan since Justice for All tour in 1989, I found myself interested in hearing the mix of these two perspectives.  While I found a couple of songs disagreeable with a symphony orchestra, old time favorites such as One and new songs such as Enter Sandman exploited the symphony and made for very moving pieces.  If I was still 20, chances are I would have scoffed at the idea of the two types.  However, a more mature mid 30's perspective really enjoyed the eclectic mix while still feeling my heart race through such songs as Master of Puppets.  Great CD!
B00005JN2Z|3.0|A stylish thriller, yes, but I found it very difficult to get past many of the preposterous holes in the logic of the film. The first two acts are good, anchored by Jamie Fox's self-assured character acting and Tom Cruise's surprisingly subtle approach. (Cruise is not often known for understating things on screen.) The plot holes are considerable, though, and I could only suspend disbelief until the AWFUL third act, which becomes an all-too-typical chase scene. I was disappointed.
B00000AFHM|5.0|The Boy with the Arab Strap moves like the tides. It's the aural equivalent of napping on the beach too close to the water, as it cycles among feelings of baking in the sun, to the gentle lapping of water against your toes, to the soft crashing of waves washing over. And back out again. If I had to list the best \\"fall asleep with the headphones on\\" albums of all time, this album would be right at the top with the Cure's Disintegration, and Pink Floyd's Meddle. One of Belle and Sebastians finest works.     It could have been a brilliant career - 4/5   Great opener. It's not uber mellow, but it is ubermelodic.     Sleep the Clock Around - 5/5  A wonderful, bouncy song that's hard to describe. After all this time I still have no idea what it's about, because I haven't ever tried to assemble the lyrics into any coherent story. When I first listened to it I loved it but assumed that due to it's simple melody, it would become repetetive, but I was wrong.     Is it Wicked not to care - 3  One of Isobel Campbells few self-written songs. I've never been a huge fan of her voice (When not used in a backing capacity) and her song writing isn't particularly good either, but this is not too bad. The melody seems a bit sophomoric, and seems to sound like a theme song for a BBC children's show from the 80's.    Ease your feet in the sea - 4 I love Stuart's vox in this one. Nothing about this tune is meant to be riveting, just a simple song about the ocean. It fits in well with the imagery evoked by the music and lyrics of the rest of the album.    A Summer Wasting - 3.75 Another summery tune (obvious?) that seemed like a low point at first but grew with my love for the album. If you heard this alone you might be inclined to think it's not a great tune, but in context of the album, it works well.    Seymour Stein - 2.75  This song achieved a little fame when it was featured in High Fidelity. In the scene, Dick is listening to the track and Barry (played by Jack Black) comes in and shuts it off, saying it sucks, only to put on Katrina and the Waves, of all things. Barry isn't far off the mark - I've always considered this the albums low point - The music is boring and uninspired and Jackson's vox are a little too warbly to be convincing. It also doesn't seem to fit well with the album. On the bright side, i've always been fond of the delivery on the lyric \\"Record company man....I won't be comin' to dinner.\\"    Space Boy Dream - 2   Oops, except for this throwaway track. When will B&S learn that electronic music is for people that can't write good songs without help from computers? Even Electronic Renaissance on Tigermilk is a \\"skipper\\" on most days.    Dirty Dream Number II - 5 Annnnd we're back. Very possibly the best song on the album. Driving and delicious to behold, with a great intro.      The Boy with the Arab Strap - 5 Another winner, easily one of the best tunes on the album and one of B&S's classics.     These song by song reviews always tend to take longer than I expected, so I'll sum up the last three tracks like this. \\"Chickfactor\\" sounds exactly as you'd expect a song called chickfactor to sound. \\"Simple things\\" is not the worst Belle and Sebastian song ever, but it's not the best either. And finally, if I were writing this album, I could not have thought of a more fitting way to end the album than \\"The Rollercoaster Ride.\\"
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|This an excellent cd from start to finish. Great package, full lyrics/credits. The bonus dvd is a bit short on running time, only three tracks and is in 2ch stereo only, picture and sound are great. I'm sure the purists will go back and listen to the original versions of some of the older tracks and prefer them to the rerecorded tracks as I did. But I salute Jethro Tull for a first class product. 16 tracks/62.18. The photos of the band members inside the booklet, they are indeed starting to show their age.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is a fantastic small movie. Well written and superbly cast. Its got a very low-budget look to it, which actually suits it perfectly. This is popcorn entertainment at its finest.
B00018D44U|4.0|2 years ago Norah Jones was an under-marketed, slept-on artist with a debut not grabbing much attention but everyone who had been insightful enough to pick up the cd knew she was the next it.  \\"Don't Know Why\\" \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" and \\"Feelin the Same Way\\" were all very impactful songs from her debut cd, COME AWAY WITH ME.  She was very fresh and new but with an old-school feel and immediately welcome to a bland music scene.  Then the grammy's came and the rest of the country caught up to what a few of us had already known.  On the heels of the instantaneous post-grammy hype she subsequently released her sophomore effort, FEELS LIKE HOME.  I'd venture to say that FEELS LIKE HOME, with 6 or 7 repeatdly listenable songs, overall is better than her debut on which i probably only listened to only 2 or 3 songs constantly.  But what \\"...HOME\\" is lacking is that big hit, the one or 2 songs drenched with immense emotion like \\"Don't Know Why.\\" Cd is worth picking up but can't get more than 4 stars because of the lack of staying power.
0451167716|5.0|I was surprised to hear that Mario Puzo wrote \\"The Godfather\\" after attempts at \\"literature\\" hadn't provided enough income.  According to the source I read he wrote this book for the money. What can I say?  I heard Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for the same reason.<br /><br />Whatever his inspiration, Puzo's tale is one I couldn't put down.  I don't know how many today read the book before seeing Coppola's movie - one of the greatest films by almost any measurement.  I read the book back in the 70s before seeing the film, and the movie vividly brought the characters in my head to life.  The advantage in the book is that Coppola is able to allow you inside the heads of the characters and flesh out much of the back and side stories.  Remember the undertaker who opens the movie, asking for the Godfather to render justice to the two punks who violated his daughter then were set free by the American court?  In the book we find out what happens to those punks.  The movie star Johnny Fontaine is fleshed out with a little Hollywood Babylon.  We get to read the story of the young Vito Corleone and how he came to become \\"The Godfather\\" - a story that doesn't show up in until the second movie with DeNiro as young Vito and Bruno Kirby brilliant as the young Tessio.  We find out how the Irish kid Tom Hagen becomes like an adopted son to the Godfather and how his intelligence enables him to go to law school and become the Godfather's next Consigliore.  We get to find out about the fearful Luca Brasi and why he's pretty much the only man that makes Vito Corleone a little nervous.<br /><br />Puzo creates a fictional world that is rich and profound and populated by larger than life characters.  Only recommended for those who want to read the quintessential gangster novel.
B00028HBL6|3.0|I found the movie quite gory however I didn't feel connected to the movie at all. All I felt was pity for a historical man. I think it should be seen as a historical point of view rather than spiritual. True it looks as though it was anti-semitic but this was true in history at that point of time but doesn't mean it was all the Jews fault that killed him. I don't think that Christians nor other people should think this is all historically accurate. Don't believe all sources from the gospels because some of the sources are changed and biased. Anyways the film was good but I didn't connect it spiritually or anything it was based more on the physical pain more then anything else.
B000654YRY|5.0|Having never seen the video, I was very happy with this DVD.  Its Dire Straits live at their best. There is a spectacular version of Private Investigation that really makes the song memorable, thanks to Mark Knopflers magical guitar work.<BR>There are also great performances of Heavy Fuel and The Bug.<br />I enjoy this DVD very much. I have watched it a few times and it gets better each time.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I am just back from a visit to the REAL Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This is a fine love story, but the facts leading up to the attack, as well as what happened are better told in the 1970 classic TORA TORA TORA. Hollywood producers and directors added in computer enhanced gadgets to no credible benefit. I have met several survivors of the day of infamy who share this opinion. You must decide if you want a love story or a war history. You choose.
0452284392|5.0|This book has some amazing insights and easy to read. It will inspire those who are dealing with the concepts of scale. Other comments have talked about Alberts ego trips but they arent ego trips. This book is written by someone that is very far into his field and is a part of it in real life. This book made me realize that there is endless inspiration on the internet and also check out this books website for some beautiful color images that accompany the chapters.
0451526384|5.0|The magic and sheer excellence of 'Persuasion' lies in the personalities of the various <br />characters: Anne Elliot, the heroine of the book, is quiet, caring and proper but beneath <br />that surface of hers, she's a woman who has loved and lost. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, <br />and her sister, Elizabeth are like mirror images of each other, both are shallow, self-proclaimed <br />snobs and conceited. Captain Frederick Wentworth, Anne's love from her past, is just excellent! <br />He's the male image of Regency cool: tall, handsome, a man of hard work and lady-killer.  <br /> <br />As a novel, 'Persuasion' is a thoughtful insight into the women left behind because of  <br />bad choices, yet it is never self-pitying. I couldn't understand why while I was reading the book <br />and at the end, I saw what Austen was trying to show. <br />That is the wicked factor of 'Persuasion', Austen allows you to either <br />be persuaded or dissuaded.  <br /> <br />As a social commentary, it is subtle in how it mocks certain <br />aspects of society such as the 'dandies' of Regency England, the men who indulged in vanity, <br />personified by Sir Walter Elliot. Yet, the books acts as a platform for the debate of marriage <br />begs the question, is marrying outside your station suicidal? <br /> <br />One critic said that 'Persuasion' was like a Regency version of the Cinderella tale: Anne Elliot <br />is Cinderella, Cpt. Frederick Wentworth her Prince Charming and Lady Russell as the  <br />Wicked Stepmother. This is a blatant over-simplification! Persuasion is at first sight a  <br />beautifully crafted and touching romance but is also a book of many layers. <br /> <br />Last Thought: Enough to convert an Austen cynic into an Austenian.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|My parents loved this event when it came out in 85.  I wasnt yet born, but my mother was talking to me about it, and when i heard about this DVD set i decided what else would make a perfect gift for my parents.  I ordered it, and I hope she loves it =D
B000000OQF|3.0|Defintely GNR's best but not worthy of the 15 million sales worldwide that it recieved.  This album did not redefine metal or hard rock, it only reskinned Def Leppard's Pyromania sound,  slammed the songs with too many instrumental parts, and repeated the chorus way to damn many times, like on Mr. Brownstone, even though I like the song, I usually skip to the next song before the end, Paradise city is the best, (and its the only GNR song I know on guitar) but is way to long, it just bores me, Sweet child o mine is good but also to drug out, the other good songs are Nightrain, My Michelle, Think about you, Welcome to the Jungle is tolerable, but the rest is pretty much just filler.  It is, however, a million times better than anything Nirvana ever did, they were just a bunch of talentless wusses who were victims of bullies in high school.  If you would like to listen to an album that is pure excellence from start to finish, then pick up Hysteria by Def Leppard, it is without a doubt better than any other album ever made, noone, I mean noone could compete with the leps sense of sogwriting craft and musical talent, they were the best.
B000669GAI|5.0|First of all, this album is an excellent compilation that shows both the power and sentience of one of the greatest American rock bands.  If you like Pearl Jam in any way, shape or form, I highly recommend this album.  It is a must have...that is unless you own 20 PJ cds already.        <br /> <br />But anyway, why would anyone complain about a greatest hits album that has all the greatest hits?  There are many great songs that are not on this album but does that mean that the songs that are on it don't deserve to be?  Absolutely not.  Not every one is a die-hard Pearl Jam fan.  This album is for them; the people that don't (yet) already own every studio album and a few bootlegs.   <br /> <br />To the die-hard; Isn't it enough that almost every live Pearl Jam concert from the past four years has been made available for purchase?  What is there to complain about?   <br />If you already own every studio album and more, why even bother with this one, and why rate it less for not having \\"Untitled\\" from Live on Two Legs?  That song is not a hit.  And if you miss it from this cd, you probably already have it on 20 bootlegs!!  Give me a break.  And please don't discredit the band for not giving the finger to the general public.  That's just rediculous.      <br /> <br />

B0001AP12G|5.0|As much as this reviewer prefers underground hip-hop to mainstream rap, Kanye West manages to merge the two genres to produce the best hip-hop album of 2004 on \\"The College Dropout\\". \\"TCD\\" is, for the most part, genius and West provides something for everyone without making the album sound incohesive. Religion (\\"Jesus Walks\\"), materialism (\\"All Falls Down\\"), 9-to-5's (\\"Spaceship\\"), adversity (\\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"Through The Wire\\"), and hardcore hip-hop (\\"Get Em High,\\" \\"We Don't Care\\") are all covered on \\"TCD,\\" not to mention the album's overwhelming theme of achieving success despite dropping out of college. Combining club hits, battle tracks, and substance like no other album in 2004, College Dropout is THE classic hip-hop album of the year. 4.5 Stars.
B00006AUIG|4.0|The most audacious element of \\"Session 9\\" is that it takes place during the day time and while there are some moments involving shadows there is only a brief bit of one sequences that actually ends up in the dark.  You do no think of bright light as being an omnipresent element in what is essentially a haunted house film, but director Brad Anderson clearly wants to scare his audience when the lights are on.  Anderson used to drive past the enormous Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusetts (built in the 1887s, condemned in 1984, and closed in 1992), which inspired the script by Anderson and his co-writer Stephen Gevedon (who plays Mike).  In that regard \\"Session 9\\" reminds me of Herke Harvey's classic low-budget horror film, \\"Carnival of Souls.\\"  But the location that inspired Anderson's film is central to the entire film, and not simply the setting for the climax.<br /><br />Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan) shows up with his Hazmat Elimination Company crew to remove asbestos from the abandoned mental hospital.  This is dangerous enough work, where the type of music you play on your boom box could literally be dangerous to your health, but of course asbestos will be the least of their worries.  There is a big bonus involved if the job is done in a week, and while Phil (David Caruso) has his doubts, they have to try.  The rest of the crew consists of Hank (Josh Lucas), whom Phil does not trust for a lot of reasons, Jeff (Brendan Sexton III), a nephew who is new to the work, and Mike (Gevedon), who is well-read enough to provide the necessary exposition regarding the place they are working on at lunch time.<br /><br />In real world history the hospital is supposed built on the site of the house of Jonathan Hathorne, one of the most fanatical judges of the witchcraft trials of Massachusetts.  Originally the Danvers State Hospital was an attempt to treat patients with delusions by bringing them to beautiful surroundings and fresh air.  But by the start of the 20th century too many patients and not enough money led to a radical shift in treatment and procedures at Danvers so that shock treatments, hydrotherapy, and lobotomies were used to control the patients (although it is not true that Danvers was where lobotomies were invented).  Once abandoned, the giant structure quickly gained a reputation for being haunted, no doubt by the ghosts of the abused patients.<br /><br />Mike tells of a more specific horror story, and we know from other horror films to always pay attention to the back-story.  It seems that once upon a time there was a young girl who was being treated who told an incredible story about very wicked things, except that what she said happened could not have happened.  The story is told by Mike to explain why the place closed down, but we know better.  That story contains clues as to what is going on, especially when Mike stumbles across the reel-to-reel tapes of the actual sessions (guess how many there were).  While everybody is racing to meet the deadline, Mike is spending his time listening to the sessions of the Doctor and the young girl.  As the others explore the building, there are other disturbing remnants of what used to happen in this place, and the fact that such things are discovered in the light of day does not lessen their impact.<br /><br />\\"Session 9\\" is certainly a stylish horror film, which is not to suggest it is devoid of substance.  But like so many of its kindred spirits I find the payoff to be less than satisfying (which is a complaint I have about \\"Apocalypse Now\\" as well, so take that for what it is worth).  Still, when the greatest sin in a horror film is that you see the end coming, I do not think most viewers will be able to figure out how everything fits together, although they should figure out the \\"who.\\"  The atmosphere of \\"Session 9\\" is on target, mainly because unlike a lot of contemporary horror films, there is no attempt to force it by letting the music do all the heavy lifting and thereare no special effects to induce stomach churning and worse.  \\"Session 9\\" is interested in true terror and not the inelegant gross out.  That alone makes it worth watching, even if turning out all the lights does little to enhance the experience.nd there are no special effects to induce stomach churning and worse.  \\"Session 9\\" is interested in true terror and not the inelegant gross out.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|RYAN ADAMS - GOLD <br /> <br />This album should have been titled \\"Spot the Influence\\". Here are the ones I picked up: <br /> <br />VAN MORRISON  <br />STONES  <br />NEIL YOUNG  <br />STEPHEN STILLS  <br />ELTON JOHN  <br />LED ZEPPELIN  <br />PAUL WESTERBERG  <br />STEVE FORBERT  <br />THE BAND  <br />THE WHO  <br />HUMBLE PIE  <br />BOB DYLAN  <br />STEVE WINWOOD  <br />  <br />I am sure you can pick up others that I missed. My favorite track is Nobody Girl which reminded me of a cross between Traffic and Neil Young (of course). His band includes Chris \\"son of Stephen\\" Stills, Benmont Tench and Adam Duritz on some background vocals. I think the albums greatest strength is its many varied styles. Its greatest weakness is living up to the hype.   <br />
B00005JNLY|4.0|\\"Spanglish\\" suffers from a near-death by over-poignancy.  It's earnest and tries so hard to please.  There is a lot to like and recommend here, though.<br /><br />In general, I'm not anti-Adam Sandler, butI love how he's consistently overcome doubters throughout his career.  Here, however, though he plays it straight the entire way through, I couldn't help thinking that I was watching Adam Sandler self-consciously taking on the bigimportantserious role.  In some of the key scenes with Paz Vega, he seemed uncomfortable.<br /><br />Speaking of Ms. Vega, she's the start of the many things that are good about Spanglish.  Like many people, I'm tired of the star-making machine trying to cram Penelope Cruz down my throat.  I like Ms. Cruz as much as the next person, but that just isn't happening, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise.  Let's hope Ms. Vega becomes everything that Team Cruz has tried to attain.  At the very least, Ms. Vega owes Ms. Cruz a thank you for chopping down the timber in front of her.  Ms. Vega had to learn both English and Mexican-inflected Spanish for her role, so its not all natural charm and eye-popping good looks up there.<br /><br />Other delights include:<br /><br />Cloris Leachman...still a scene-stealer 40 years (!) after the Mary Tyler Moore show made her a household name.  The Executive Producer of MTM was a young James L. Brooks, showing that it never hurts to make friends and be nice to people.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce...as Ms. Vega's daughter Cristina, she has one incredible scene in which she acts as translator between Vega and Sandler, taking on not only the words, but also the intonations, body language and passion of the original speaker.  It's the second-best scene in the movie.<br /><br />T&eacute;a Leoni...as Sandler's wife.  Ms. Leoni is this country's best physical comedienne on the big screen ('Flirting With Disaster' anyone?), and she proves it again here, with a hilarious, over-the-top, not-quite-a-sex scene, replete with jogging bra and running shoes in which Sandler is only a convenient bystander.  This one should go right up there with Meg Ryan's famous \\"I'll have what she's having\\" scene in \\"When Harry Met Sally.\\"ging bra and running shoes in which Sandler is only a convenient bystander.

B00005MP58|5.0|I love this adaption of the best novel in the world. I am an avid reader  of Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite! When I watched this  I fell in love with Darcy all over again. The acting is without fault and  the scenery and costumes are beautiful. Elizabeth Bennet is my favorite  heroine in all of literature and Jennifer Ehle did a tremendous job! It is  so true to the book. This adaption is much better than the black and white  version. That one is awful and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This is  the perfect video to accompany a great book. Everyone who loves Jane Austen  or period drama should watch this movie!
B00002MZ2T|1.0|That's when I got interested in them. I liked their ballad songs especailly. But when I had a chance to listen to Affirmation in a CD store, I passed on it. It just had too many songs that sounded like really bland filler. Something also just bothers me about guys who use falsetto the whole time. When I first heard some of the songs, I could've sworn it women signing it. Just looking at the guys (really effeminate looking) and also knowing they use falsetto makes you obviously think they are gay, but of course I can't prove that. If they are, they should come out about it so it wouldn't make people ask embarassing questions about them. People would say they're in love...
B0002OERI0|1.0|More Bush bashing from people who have most likely never read a work of history or economics, but think leftist posturing is oh so fashionable. When I was an immature college student everybody was smoking pot, going to antiwar demonstrations and putting up Che Guevara posters on their walls. We listened to revolution anthems like Jefferson Airplane's \\"Volunteers\\" and the Stones \\"Street Fighting Man\\" with clenched fists in the air. Then, most of us grew up, got jobs, raised families and came to appreciate the miracle that is American democracy and the incredible wealth producing engine that is capitalism. We can do without the Michael Moores and Green Days of this world. They should thank their lucky stars for Amerca and it's leadership.
0446310786|5.0|Delightful dialogue, lots of pearls of wisdom from Atticus to Scout and Jem(father to kids), and a surrealstic view of the South in that period through the eyes of Scout- a pre-teen, confident and spunky narrator.  <br />

Now that I'm grown, I'm rereading them with my family, and they still take me away to the days Laura grew up in oh so fast.  These are a wonderful set of books to read by yourself, or to your family.
630514415X|5.0|This movie is very good, i am a huge spike lee fan. Ray Allen is great in this film...when i first saw this i had no idea who he was, and would of never guessed he was a basketball player. And to the post that said \\"he might consider Milla Jovovich if you were coming out of prison too\\"...your crazy, she's hot.
B00005JNLY|4.0|This movie was a great romantic drama with some comedy and laughs, but it wasn't all it could be. It stretches for over two hours and, if you're not used to Adam Sandler being serious, it can really bore the heck out of you. But once you get used to the vibe of the film, you will enjoy it.  <br /> <br />The movie is told by Christina in her letter to Princeton (I think) and how she tells her up-to-this-point life story. He mother Flor, who is completely Spanish becomes a maid in Los Angeles at the house of a wealthy family. The man of the house, Sandler, has just been named top chef of the year by NY Times. The mother, whose \\"company was downsized to zip two years ago,\\" is a stay@home mom who has some dirty secrets (as you'll find out.) The children are laden with personal problems and insecurities and when this maid and her daughter (Christina) coems to live with them, the two families blend together (SPANISH family+ENGLISH family=SPANGLISH family!). And there are no subtitles, so you have to pay attention, which is another plus to the film.
B0002858YS|1.0|This music is so devoid of substance, they make other pretentious bands from this genre look deep.  This is Hollywood's version of the New York/Garage Band scene, and it's AWFUL!!  The lyrics?  The blatant rip off of Blur's Girls and Boys (Somebody Told Me)?  Blondie's \\"Dreaming\\" (Mr. Brightside)? Come on.
B00004TS0E|4.0|Now, first off, I haven't seen the original, so I may like that more, I don't know.  I'm planning on watching the original now that I've seen this one, because the overall message of the movie I just loved.  What a wonderful message to child and adult alike.  But why do they feel the need to add tasteless humor and foul language to ruin such a wonderful movie.  Did the drunk santa's pants HAVE to fall down and expose his rear??  Did he HAVE to use the term Numb N--s?  Did Dylan MacDermots character have to say, \\"I just bought some mistletoe, why don't we go to my place and try it out\\"  And those are just the few that come to mind.  I know there were a couple of other phrases and comments that my husband and I thought were just not needed.  I mean, they certainly don't add to the plot.  Come on now!!!!Why do they insist on ruining such a family oriented movie like that!??!  Either find an edited copy for children, or check out the original.  (I haven't seen it, but I'm sure they don't say numb n--s)
B000002KD9|4.0|A must-have, eh? So what's with the four stars?  Yes, well, I'm really only a \\"mid-level\\" fan. And Neil Young is something of an acquired taste...his voice, while much different from Bob Dylan's, is almost as difficult to get used to for casual listeners, and the extremely eclectic nature of his output means that his sales has never matched that of, say, the Beatles or the Stones, even though he is second to Dylan only in terms of influence.    I like Neil Young a lot, but I'm not a huge fan. For me, five stars is \\"Muddy Waters at Newport\\" or \\"Exile On Main Street\\". But  this timeless singer/songwriter-album is a classic, no doubt about it, and it includes some of Neil Young's best songs.   Opening with the briskly rolling \\"Tell Me Why\\", \\"After The Gold Rush\\" is almost solely acoustic, consolidating the image that Young had gained through his tenure with Crosby, Stills and Nash.  But one of the best songs, the harsh \\"Southern Man\\", which evokes images of burning crosses and other atrocities, is a gritty rocker with some sizzling lead guitar by Young himself, and it inspired Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd to write \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" which includes the lines \\"I hope Neil Young will remember, the Southern man don't need him around anymore\\". And \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\" packs quite as punch as well, in a low-key sort of way.    The rest of these 11 songs are gentle folkish love songs, lazy shuffles, and country-flavoured ballads, like the classic \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\", the mournful \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\", and the title track. \\"Don't Let It Break You Down\\" is reminicent of Bernie Leadon, and the slow \\"I Believe In You\\" is pure CSN(&Y).    As I said, this is a must-have for serious Young fans. And I have it as well, as you can see, so less serious fans won't be disappointed either. If you're into Neil Young, this is for you. \\"After The Gold Rush\\" is one of his finest albums.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Equilbrium is one of those movies that are very unnoticed cause of overrated films like The Matrix and all that yadi yada.  I happend to rent this film on the recommendation of my friend who said the film is absolutley brilliant and awesome so I gave this a try.  I must say this film was extreamly well done.  The plot was pretty damn good, the Actor were great(even Taye Diggs and I'm not a fan of him at all)and the action is amazing.  I've read some reviews saying this film is just mostly mindless violence and nothing els.  Well I must say you're just an idiot or you have not payed attention to this movie at all. <br /> <br />The plot is really cool and I'm not gonna spoil it for you but it has some really great elements.  Christian Bale did an awesome job playing Prestan Cleric.  I don't think they could have gotten a better person to play him and I will say this to all those Matrix fanboys out there This film outdoes the whole trilogy!  That's right, Equilibrium has fantastic Characters and a great plot and I must say the choreographer did a great job with the action.  That's were the movie gets really good.. <br /> <br />The action in this film unlike the matrix which almost all CGI this film has some real action(atleast that's what I thought)and I must say Christian Bale did the job right.  Some of the best and Amazing gun fights I've ever seen(mainly the final battle with Preston and Father)and I must say it wont disapoint.  The action totally outdoes the Matrix and as previous reiviewers have said, you cannot compare this with the Matrix at all mainly cause the're just totally different movies!  Besides the amazing action and gun fights one of the coolest parts in the film are the characters outfits, very rockin' and cool to wear and it's even better then the Matrix outfits. <br /> <br />The only problem I had was the film felt a tad bit short and there should have bint a tad bit more Action. <br /> <br />Overall with a Cool Plot, Great costume outfit, amazinggunfights/katana fights/ect(though needed some more action)and cool villans like the Father I give it a <br /> <br />4.6 out of 5 stars... <br /> <br />Lates
B000002JSP|5.0|People resent the legacy of Led Zeppelin and often write vitriolic reviews without even being familiar with the material.A very puerile approach indeed.At least Zeppelin didn't need to paint their faces to hide their shame because they were musicians not clowns hiding their incompetence behind Rock's paraphernalia. <br />Anyway,all Zeppelin albums deserve 5 stars because of the quality of the production,wether people like the music or not that's another matter.Jones acquired a new set of keyboards and arrived to rehearsals earlier than the rest of the band hence his output was geater on the sessions.Plant wanted a different approach and requested a change of pace,that's how Tex Mex like material like 'Hot Dog' and 'South Bound Saurez' was written,they feature rockabilly-stile playing and do wop choruses as well as country licks by Page. <br />Instead of a blues number they opted to play a bluesy ballad,something that became very popular in the 80's;'I'm Gonna Crawl' has an arrangement of synthesised strings and a great solo by Page to complement Plant's heartfelt singing. <br />They could also go \\"classical\\", another superb ballad 'All My Love'(The only Zeppelin Original without a songwritting credit to Page)feature a superb arrangement of strings,a Bach-inspired keyboard solo and subtle acoustic guitar embellishments;one of Plant's best latter-day performances. <br />Afro-Cuban anyone?,'Fool In The Rain' has a tropical feel to it complete with samba percussion by Bonham and an amazing solo by Page,again the arrangement is spectacular with piano and acoustic guitars to support Plant's awesome performance. <br />Electronic experimentation?,yes they did one jaw-dropping composition with John Paul Jones arranging an assortment of synthesised sounds to a rather bizarre set of vocals by Plant.Page plays the doubleneck to great effect and Bonzo is in the engine room,just amazing how the piece swirls across the speakers.Also worth of praise are Jones's basslines throughoutthe album. <br />The album's opener is the headbanger,'In The Evening',its characteristic somber interludes are broken by the violent outbursts of a Page trademark riff,the guitar solo features vibrato bar mania as the tremolo arm of the guitar is heavily depressed,then released to add a shocking effect.The Page/Plant interplay is top notch(Check the live version on the DVD) as they go to lower notes unlike the high-pitched sounds of the early days. <br />As you can imagine,there's more to this album that the prejudiced,sterile,reviews that disregard the fact that Zeppelin was always an eclectic band(check out 'Wearing And Tearing','Darlene','Ozone Baby'from the Coda album and the bootleg of the superb outtake 'Fire' to see all the possible directions they could have taken just for this album),all their albums are different and feature superb musicianship and songwrtitting bless their socks.    <br />
B00005JNJ7|2.0|I went and saw this film opening night with some friends let me tell ya this ain't that funny.  Team America is another \\"Creative\\" film braugh to you by the creators of south park.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone are really great writers/Directors and my question is WHAT WENT WRONG!  This movie had some laugh and gags(i.e the scene were the main character is vomiting for about 1 minutes or so) and that's it.  Sure this movie is crude but hey what were you expecting it's from the creators of South Park.  Now the plot is pretty funny but trust me it's not.  I have a sence of Humor and everything but I didn't find this film all that it was cooked up to be. <br /> <br />Trey Parker and Matt Stone should just stick to South Park.  This is probably one of there worst films IF you rank it up with all there other films(Orgazmo, BASEketball). <br /> <br />I thought South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut was funnier then this.  Now overall If I had to choose Trey Parker and Matt Stone's best film it would have to be Orgazmo, hands down. <br /> <br />Overall the crude Humor, explicet language and the toilet humor may be funny for certain people and ages and for some not but for me they just tried to make this junk over the top which they shouldn't have cause near the end of the film where the character uses his Speech to save America it was just...not funny.. <br /> <br />Overall I give it a 2.0 out of 5 stars <br /> <br />Shame on you Guys you know better then this.  I also wanna point at this film is worst then South Park as the use of Profanity is over the top and lots of explicit violence and gore(mainly near the end of the film)makes this one of the most overthe top Puppet films ever..Not to mention the Sex Scene which was originally 2 minutes or so I heard that got it's NC-17 but still this \\"toned down\\" version is still as bad as the way the creators wanted it to be. <br /> <br />Not a good film but if you wanna check out a really great film by these guys then check out Orgazmowhich is a really funny film. <br /> <br />Lates
B00006RINF|4.0|The songs are more passionate and the vocal efforts from both Cristina and Andrea are wonderful. This band could not be complete without any of them and they are one of the most exciting vocal duos on the whole metal scene. You can say whatever you want about a band not being a band without each and every member but there is no way Lacuna Coil would have become the band they are today without these two personalities. They give the band the edge they need to have to stay ahead of the rising competition. There are not many metal bands that you can refer to as being romantic but Lacuna Coil is certainly one of them. Just like their previous release \\"Comalies\\" is a very coherent and even album and it is difficult to pick out one track as being better than another but in general the songs are a little better than last time. This makes \\"Comalies\\" a must-have album for everyone who feel at home in the more emotional corner of the metal scene. If I had to pick a favorite track it would probably be \\"Swamped\\", \\"Heaven's a Lie\\" and '\\"Aeon/Tightrope\\"  but it is a very difficult choice to make since all the songs are great.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is one of the best films ever made in Cinema and I give credit to the Director and the actors, mainly Guy Pearce.  What makes Memento a great and unique film is that it plays backwards, though some parts acctually play forward(i.e the black and white scense)it kind of gets you confused which you'll have to acctually use your brain to figure out though later in the film it becomes easier to understand and you'll get the hang of it. <br /> <br />The story is pretty simple.  Leonard(Pearce)is out for revenge, to get the man who raped and murdered his wife.  The problem is that Leonard suffers from a rare brain disorder which means he can't make new memory(AKA short term memory loss)but for some odd reason he can remember things before his injury(which still kind of bothers me for some reason) and must write down notes and stuff like that inorder to get to the next puzzle or answer.  Since he has this short term memory loss he must take pictures, write down things and get tatoo's on his body which gives him clues and facts in order for him to get one step closer to the answer.  On his way through this journey of finding the man who did this to him he makes friends with a woman named Natalie and Teddy who may know more about Leonard then he could imagine.  To make things worse for Leonard he gets caught with some troubles like getting cooked up with some guy named Dodd(what he does and who he is you'll have to see the film for yourself)...Overall this is an Excellent film. <br /> <br />The film is pretty original if you ask me and Director Christopher Nolan did an excellent job editing, pacing this whole film. <br /> <br />I really like how the movie plays backwards which give the audience little confusion but that's it and the black and white scenes are very juicy and detailed until the very last scene where we find out what the real truth is.  You see the movie plays at the very end of the film and plays backwards to the very beginning of the film.  I really liked the characters in this film especially Teddy.  The characters were great and it's good to see Carrie-Anne Moss not dressed in black trying to save Zion and make out with Neo for a change... <br /> <br />Overall Memento blew me away.  This film has excellent writing editing, Great Actors, Excellent yet very simple story told backwards and some really great yet accward moments and there for I give this film a  <br /> <br />5 out of 5 stars... <br /> <br />Lates..
B000089RVX|5.0|Quite odd that I listen to this album quite religiously everyday and never wrote a review for it (?!)<br /><br />I have to say that this album changed my life. I love it with a passion and Amy and Ben's lyrics and musicianship is astounding! The music, strings, violins, guitar sounds and lyrics are incendiary. I can't say enough good things about this album. It deserves to have sold all 13 million copies that it sold that's for sure. Thank you to both Amy Lee and Ben Moody (although you left the band) for creating this amazing piece of art. This album has helped me get through so many horrible rough times this past year. I can relate to every single lyric in 'Fallen'. 5 stars is just not enough to rate this beauty!<br /><br />Buy this album now if you haven't!
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is the album which will be remembered as the Rush masterpiece and as one of the most clever, intelligent, visionary and forward album of the last century. It is actually a true music masterpiece not limiting this judgement to rock or prog rock. We're talking about some fantastic music no matter the category. This album is something as good and important as Kind of Blue, Aerial boundaries, or Led Zeppelin IV. It is visionary and perfect as these three albums. Moving pictures comprehend seven perfect songs that will give you a perfect picture of the band and of the kind of music they created. Seven masterpieces, I'm not exaggerating guys, believe me. Everytime I read the titles of the tunes contained here I almost can't believe to my eyes, to what they're reading. Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, YYZ, Limelight, The camera eye, Witchunt, Vital signs. Every tune has become an important part of Rush' shows because they are incredibly well written. Maybe ony The camera eye didn't make it but not because it isn't a great tune but only because it is slow in its intro so probably \\"live\\" it couldn't be exciting enough. I am madly in love with this album. I don't think I have to say something about Tom Sawyer because even the stones know what this tune is all about. I'll say that it's an incredible modern anthem. Maybe one of the greatest in the entire history of rock music. I'm not Joking here uys. I'm serious. It's dispair time signature doesn't seem awkward because the parts are so well crafted and the melodies so convincing that everything flows perfectly natural. This is genius guys. The lyric is about the courage of individualism. Marvellous words for my ears! Only another lyric from Rush I love as much as this one. Grand designs! Back to Moving Pictures, Red barchetta is a fantastic trip in science fiction, with a music chart that is perfect for the visionary and evocative lyrics; YYZ is probably the most entertaining and spectacular instrumental song considering every prog album or rock album ever produces by any band. Limelight is another magnetic, charismatic, incredible hit with a clever lyric; The camera eye is a perfect painting, very well crafted; Witchunt is haunting, if you listen to it one time it will be stuck in your mind forever; last but not least Vital Signs another awkward tune that only these three masters could make it work so perfectly!!!! I don't have enough words for this album. It is difficult in its forms but it is easy to love, it is clever and epic in its scope but it's not boring. It's a mammuth music event, but it's extremely entertaining and exilarating! Geddy's bass and vocal parts never sounded so good, Neil never played so richly and balanced, Alex's part never be so well written and inserted. Moving pictures is a perfect clockwork!!! Moving pictures is a masterpiece of the last century and rightly will be remembered as the best effort from Rush a band known for its perfectionism. Moving pictures it's still one of the albums I love the most in my 6000 cd's collection. God bless Rush for this GEM!!!ring every prog album or rock album ever produces by any band.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Ewan is so hot! I think he is the best in this movie. I think most women (and I guess even some men) are totally into Ewan. I first wrote a review for this film in 2001 but I never felt Ewan got enough credit. Why was he not nominated along with the splendid Nicole Kidman?
1591391105|5.0|This book is not just for managers at the executive level. It's also for you and me. It's for functional managers, project managers, and supervisors. The book targets new leaders at all levels that are making the transition from one rung of the ladder to the next.    If you have just been promoted to a new leadership position (or expect to be soon), then this book is for you.     The book outlines ten strategies that will shorten the time it takes you to reach what Watkins calls the breakeven point: the point at which your organization needs you as much as you need the job. Here they are ... the ten strategies:    1. PROMOTE YOURSELF. Make a mental break from your old job. Prepare to take charge in the new one. Don't assume that what has made you successful so far will continue to do so. The dangers of sticking with what you know, working hard at doing it, and failing miserably are very real.    2. ACCELERATE YOUR LEARNING. Climb the learning curve as fast as you can in your new organization. Understand markets, products, technologies, systems, and structures, as well as its culture and politics. It feels like drinking from a fire hose. So you have to be systematic and focused about deciding what you need to learn.     3. MATCH STRATEGY TO SITUATION. There are no universal rules for success in transitions. You need to diagnose the business situation accurately and clarify its challenges and opportunities. The author identifies four very different situations: launching a start-up, leading a turnaround, devising a realignment, and sustaining a high-performing unit. You need to know what your unique situation looks like before you develop your action plan.    4. SECURE EARLY WINS. Early victories build your credibility and create momentum. They create virtuous cycles that leverage organizational energy. In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results.     5. NEGOTIATE SUCCESS. You need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss and manage his or her expectations. No other relationship is more important. This means having a series of critical talks about the situation, expectations, style, resources, and your personal development. Crucially, it means developing and gaining consensus on your 90-day plan.    6. ACHIEVE ALIGNMENT. The higher you rise in an organization, the more you have to play the role of organizational architect. This means figuring out whether the organization's strategy is sound, bringing its structure into alignment with its strategy, and developing the systems and skills bases necessary to realize strategic intent.    7. BUILD YOUR TEAM. If you are inheriting a team, you will need to evaluate its members. Perhaps you need to restructure it to better meet demands of the situation. Your willingness to make tough early personnel calls and your capacity to select the right people for the right positions are among the most important drivers of success during your transition.     8. CREATE COALITIONS. Your success will depend on your ability to influence people outside your direct line of control. Supportive alliances, both internal and external, will be necessary to achieve your goals.      9. KEEP YOUR BALANCE. The risks of losing perspective, getting isolated, and making bad calls are ever present during transitions. The right advice-and-counsel network is an indispensable resource    10. EXPEDITE EVERYONE. Finally, you need to help everyone else - direct reports, bosses, and peers - accelerate their own transitions. The quicker you can get your new direct reports up to speed, the more you will help your own performance.    This book is not only relevant on the individual level. This transition process for new managers happens so often that it should be handled with more professionalism by (big) organizations. Whereas we as managers try to workactively with introduction programmes and training for new employees, then many managers must face their transition challenge alone. It shouldn't be like that. The \\"sink or swim\\" approach should be doomed.    Peter Leerskov,   M.Sc. in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business
B00028HBKM|5.0|I first saw \\"The Passion\\" at the movies with my husband. Both of us were speechless and could not utter a word until after we arrived home. I've read in the Bible numerous times about the crucifixion of Christ, but seeing an interpretation of how it could have been was spellbinding. You just can't imagine how painful, bloody, or brutal the crucifixioun really was until you \\"see\\" it in front of you.  <br /> <br />I would not take children to see this movie. I feel it is too graphic for young ones. After all, many adults I've talked with couldn't handle the scale of physical brutality that was shown.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie for adult church groups who are discussing the crucifixion and what Jesus had to go through in order for Christians to have Eternal Life. It is an excellent source for discussion. <br /> <br />Lastly, I would also like to point out a particular review that caught my eye. For the benefit of the \\"gentleman\\" who wrote the review, I'd like to ask him why in the world he watched this movie if he didn't like the subject matter. The quality of production, acting, and cinematography should be considered as well in a review.
B00030590I|5.0|If you guys are like me, when you originally saw previews for this movie, you asked yourself how much different could it be from Crouching Tiger and all the other simular movies. Let me tell you...it's much, much better. The visual effects are stunning to say the least, and the story-line is brilliant. This movie successfully captivates it's audience with jaw-dropping fight scenes, alluring use of color and shade, and genius combonation of retro and contemporary sound effects. Jet Li's intensity is portrayed in the lead character, and he does a great job as the \\"hero\\" to say the least. Very well balanced film, and without a doubt the best modern \\"kung-fu flick\\" to hit U.S shores.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Although I am a big R&B/Hip-Hop/Rap fan, I found this CD to be quiet well put together and hot! I find myself dancing and singing the words to these songs. T.A.T.U. seemed to pop out of nowhere, but they are here to stay! <br /> <br />Not Gonna Get Us (10/10) - The hottest song on the CD! It makes you want to dance and scream at the top of your lungs. I believe it's about them being them against the world. How cute. <br /> <br />All The Things She Said (10/10) - The first single that made me go pick the CD up. I love it to death! <br /> <br />Show Me Love (10/10) - Another well put together song. It has to be my favorite song as well as \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\". It is so deep. It makes you sad, mad, happy, and feel hot and sweaty all at once. <br /> <br />30 Minutes (10/10) - A sweet, slow song. It really stands out on the album. It is also very deep and poetic. The writing on this CD is excellent. <br /> <br />How Soon Is Now? (5/10) - Never really listen to this song but it's alright. <br /> <br />Clowns (Can You See Me Now?) (8/10) - A very upbeat, dance track. <br /> <br />Malchik Gay (Gay Boy) (10/10) - A very hot song with a nice beat. I believe it's about gay boys. Weird but OK. <br /> <br />Stars (10/10) - One of the most poetic and sad songs on the CD. It is so mystical and makes you feel sorrow in your heart. <br />I love the beat! <br /> <br />Ya Shosla S Uma (10/10) - The \\"All The Things She Said\\" song in Russian. I try to sing along but it is so funny! <br /> <br />Nas ne Dagoniat (10/10) - \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" in Russian. Boy this girls are really takin' us to Russia huh? <br /> <br />Show Me Love [Extended Version] (10/10) - A great song made longer. How much better can this CD get? <br /> <br />Overall Grade: A-

B0000DD7LC|5.0|I think that this CD is much better than her first CD (although I loved that CD as well). This CD seems as if she actually led me on a musical \\"journey\\". I could really relate to most of the songs (felt as if she had conversations with me and put them to music!) and that to me, makes a great artist. I hope that Alicia Keys continues to dominate the music scene with her talent.
B000687M48|5.0|&quot;Anywhere But Home&quot; is awesome. Its TWO discs-- One is a CD, the others a DVD -- and includes a FULL concert in Paris. I know what your thinking. 'Thats not so great, I've heard ALL the songs, I just want it for the music videos.' While the music videos ARE unbearably[Spl? Heh heh. Oops.]cool, the concert is superior. I mean, really, man, its so neat! First off, the lights are VERY awesome. Amy actually sounds really good live. Ya'know, the only people I really think are good live are her and Avril. Seether, of course as well....Off topic, Off topic. ANYWAYS, the piano on &quot;Thoughtless&quot; forces me to gape in happiness. Before my Delicious Spam-Inflicted rant is over, let me just say that the Behind the Scenes are funny as hell. <BR>Anyway, purchase the DVD or you will perish under the mighty hand of evil non-purchasing-music gods. I don't even know what I'm typing anymore. Ignore me.<br />~Rev. MEAT~
0743201140|3.0|I have taken many of the various \\"quadrant personality tests\\" that evaluate your responses to the various questions and then tells you your personality type. So I didn't hold out much hope of learning a lot that was new when I picked up this volume. However, I was pleasantly surprised by a couple of things. First, there is a password assigned to each book. With that password you are able to access a web site, establish an account, and answer a questionnaire which does in fact give you your top five strengths.<br /><br />But what is most useful is that armed with the survey results and this book, you are not only able to know your strengths but also how to build on those strengths. What is new here, is that the authors break the mold of \\"work on eliminating your weaknesses.\\" Instead, the advise us to pay attention to building up our strengths, to always find ways to use those strengths instead of worrying so much about our weaknesses. Sure, we do have to try and mitigate any negative attributes we may have in order to work with others, but the really successful person will work to play to his or her own strengths.<br /><br />You will learn why strength is defined as \\"consistent near perfect performance in an activity.\\" You will see why it makes sense to \\"manage around your weaknesses.\\" And you will be given clear, concise  guidelines on how to manage others through their strengths and help them manage around their weaknesses. I will definitely be using many of the principles and ideas put forth in this book as I go about helping my clients shape their corporate cultures and improve their effectiveness.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Portraying a future america on film is a tricky thing to do.  Movies like Robocop, AI or Bladerunner have all had their take on life in our country several hundred years from now, but I, Robot is only 30 years out.  And yet, the skyline of Chicago is more dramatically changed than a mere thirty years would allow. <br />The cars with autopilot and superspeed highways are also too far flung for such a near future.  Will Smith's character Calvin is apparently making a fashion statement by wearing a pair of Converse hightops, even his Granny comments on his strange footwear.  People have been wearing converse since the 1950's and will continue to.  I hardly think that in 2030, anyone will raise an eyebrow.  I think the golden rule when it comes to envisioning the future is that the more things change, the more things stay the same.  I understand that movies are a visual medium and must fill the screen with new and exciting images, and because of that I forgive I,Robot some of the extraneous machinery.  But would someone please steer Hollywood away from the semi-transparent white plastic veiw of future devices?  We have all seen an Apple computer, and that look is already becoming dated.  Will robot designers in 2030 really be taking their concept ideas from the look of a outdated PC from the late 1990's?  It's possible.  Maybe it's supposed to be retro.
B0002MB7QW|2.0|This one gets an extra half star because they have enough money & the special effects on these disaster movies (will they ever end?) does keep getting better. In the past, we have seen the White House blow up, the Emplre State Building incinerate & the Statue of Liberty beached. In real life we all saw The WTC disiintegrate before our very eyes on 9/11. This time the Statue of Lberty is up to her neck in ice. It's a new ice age.  The vice president is the viilian, evil, wrong & as scary as he is in real life, along with his side-kick George the Dim. Actually, the president in the movie is more of a wimp than our real president. But he is just as stupid. This ice age will cover most of the northern hemisphere. So we  all pack up & head south for Mexico. They greet us with open arms... just like we welcome their citizens traveling north today in real life. Right.   21/2 stars
B00000DC4A|5.0|I am a huge Bryan Adams fan...have been for quite some time.  There's just something about that husky, smoky voice of his that melts my heart when he sings, especially his ballads.  Anyway, this, by far, is my favorite album of all his others.  I honestly can say there isn't one song on this CD that I DON'T like, which is rare for me...I can always pick out at least three or four that I'm not real fond of.  His \\"18 Til I Die\\" CD is also great, but there are a couple of tunes on it I could do without.  This CD, however, is one I can crank up, put on continuous play, and listen to over and over again.  I love it.  One of my favorite tunes on here is \\"I'm A Liar.\\"  It's just such a fun, upbeat song.  Also, \\"C'mon, C'mon, C'mon\\" is a smooth sounding song with a great melody.  If faced with a choice between this and ANY other CD of Bryan Adams, go with this one...trust me on this.  You'll come to adore it, just as I do.  One day, I'll have to buy another one because I'll wear out the one I have from being played too much.  But, for a second choice, definitely go with \\"18 Til I Die\\" or \\"So Far So Good;\\" either albums are great choices, too.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This film is a classic Michael Mann signature genre hit.  You know when a serial killer always has a signature. That signature will always be there. Can you see it? Can you feel it? \\"Collateral\\" is a signature Michael Mann crime thriller film all the way.<br /><br />  \\"Collateral\\" is about a contract killer (Tom Cruise) who has ten hours to kill five people in Los Angeles. The unfortunate cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is in the wrong place wrong time when his next fair is Vincent (Mr. Cruise) For a mere $600.00, Max is thrust into driving this hired killer around to each contract or be killed himself. Vincent must be a killing machine to take five people in ten-hour scenario. And he IS.<br /><br />  Tom Cruise absorbs Vincent's character and brings him to life. Vincent is well schooled and rehearsed in combat, tactical recovery and covert opperations. (And he utilizes them all!) The interaction between Max and Vincent is like a clash of opposite polar forces. Different views, personalities and upbringing are topics of discussion. Jamie Foxx plays Max's character superbly. Max's growth in the film is only supported by Jamie's vastly improved acting skills. Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx work well together in this film.<br /><br />  The film takes on a \\"24\\" feel for time. But the length of the film is actually two hours. Jada Pinkett Smith takes on a supporting role as a prosecuting attorney. She compliments Foxx's on screen personality.<br /><br />  If you are a Michael Mann fan, you will not be disappointed with this film. Who doesn't like Tom Cruise? Jamie Foxx? Okay then see it!<br /><br />  Purchase the widescreen DVD only. Don't miss this bonus feature; \\"City of Night: The Making of Collateral\\" features the actual lead actors discussing their roles. N-I-C-E.

B0000CABBW|5.0|I did not think I would like this movie but I was blown away by how well the story works.  Keisha Castle-Hughes pulls you in and before you know it you are totally in her grip.  The story could have taken place in any number of marginalized communities and thus it universality.  I recommend it to anyone!
068987474X|1.0|Okay, i like SATC as much as the next person, but just because someone wrote some comedy episodes deosn't mean they know what every man in the world is thinking about dating.   <br />Okay, all men call you every day to say hi if they're into you.  Never mind that I have male friends who LOVE their girls but only call them whne they actually have time to really talk.  guys apparently don't need recovery time after divorces or break-ups, 'cause if they are into you they will climb whatever mountain they need to to have you.  that's rediculous.  I've seen friends and brothers not want to get hurt, not ready to get out there again.  All men are not the same, just like all women are not the same.  no catch all \\"if he does this he's not into you\\" list works for all men.  My youngest brother read this book at my request and agrees with me.  Be smart enough to pick up on when the signals tell you, he doesn't think you're the one. but don't lump everyman together liek there's no differnce in behavior and thought process.  I'm sure most women wouldn't want for all of us to be lumped toghether and treated like we were all exactly the same.  if all men think the same, why would we care which one we ended up with anyway? one's exactly like the next, right?
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I was at the Live Aid show at JFK, and it was an amazing day (also amazingly hot!).  Some have complained about certain artists being left off the DVD (Zeppelin, Santana), and that's a shame, but it was either the artist's decision or due to technical problems.  What is on the DVD is pretty amazing stuff, for the most part.  You can't expect all of the performers to be perfect in such a huge show.  Crosby, Stills, & Nash were horrible.  Bob Dylan, a notoriously inconsistent live performer, was awful (and I'm a huge Dylan fan).  Madonna wasn't very good.  The one funny thing about her performance was left off the DVD.  Live Aid happened just a few weeks after her nude photos were published by Playboy.  She came out on stage, on a very hot day, wearing a long jacket, and said, \\"I ain't taking s--t off today!\\"  Mick Jagger wasn't too great.  The Thompson Twins/Madonna version of \\"Revolution\\" was ghastly. <br /> <br />But there was so much great music.  Paul Young was great--excellent voice and great stage presence.  U2 was absolutely phenomenal--the best of the many great London performances.  Dire Straits was awesome, as always. Queen owned the Wembley crowd, especially with \\"Radio Gaga.\\"  David Bowie was great, especially \\"Heroes.\\"  The Pretenders, The Who, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Neil Young--all excellent.  It was cool to see Phil Collins doing \\"In The Air Tonight,\\" even though it was just him on piano.  When he came to the part of the song where the drums kick in on the studio version, half the crowd at JFK started playing air drums.  You don't see that on the DVD, unfortunately.  And Hall & Oates doing old Temptations songs with Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin--priceless!  When Ashford & Simpson brought out Teddy Pendergrass for his first perfomance since being paralyzed, that was quite an emotional moment, and a great song. <br /> <br />But perhaps the best performer at JFK was Patti Labelle.  Her performances of \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Forever Young\\" are jaw-droppingly amazing. <br /> <br />All in all, a great concert.  By far the best concert I've ever attended.  And I love the DVD.  It's for a good cause, so buy lots of copies.
B00008V5VN|5.0|This has got to be the definitive record associated with the entire stoner/doom/heavy blues/70's psychedelia genre.  It has it all, baby!!!  Crushing bass (Al Cisneros), mighty guitars (the great Matt Pike), and a drum pattern that is captivating and entrancing (the beautiful Chris Hakius).  The intro guitar clocks in at around 2:30, and if the record hasn't drawn you in at this time, the next full 60 sec. should have you.  If not, then you won't like this record.  There are three actual break downs in this record, the first solo (14:20) which grooves, the second solo (38:52) which drives into your soul with the same passion as Jimi, or even SRV; then the clean guitar comes in at about 41:24, and all bets are off.  This is destined to become a classic (as it already has among the weedium masses).  If you love to drone out, dig in-a-gadda-da-vida, and enjoy being pummeled by the heaviest sounds known to man, buy this f'n record!  NOW!!!!!
0790729628|3.0|Although Blade Runner is a visual buffet, and has had some tweaks with the director's rendition, it still has some issues.<br /><br />I have heard through the years about the incredible places this film takes you. A dark, crowded metropolis full of fumes and sick rejects. Let me say, visually it exceeded my expectations. Although I am fully aware how they created the environments I was looking at, I still caught myself with my jaw creeping open. It's pretty incredible. Tall skyscrapers riddle every street and no matter which direction you look, there are always thousands of bystanders to keep you from moving any faster then a hobble. Its always been funny to me how films of any decade, not just the 80's, envision the future. In the 40's, tv shows depicted us living on distant planets by the year 2000. (Conan echoes in my head.) Also, in the majority of 80's flicks (aka: Total Recall etc...) they have everyone in goofy garb with bad haircuts and freaks lurking on every corner. Fortunately, Blade Runner skipped that idealism pretty smoothly. There is a fraction, but the murkiness and dank environments wash these visuals away. It all meshes nicely.<br /><br />I especially liked Vangelis' score. It has a \\"washing\\" effect over the visuals, and it works on a unique level. Its obvious they wanted this to sound otherworldly. Success.<br /><br />I can sum up the quality of this dvd's composition with one word: Bitter. The film itself is better than vhs, so I'm not going to complain. Thats all most care about anyway. The Menu is horrible, and jeez, a flipper? This year marked the 20'th anniversary. Find any material you can WB, smash it on a lone disk then put the film with a new transfer, with repairs, and anamorphic widescreen format. And with the audio... ouch. 2.0 dolby digital. Imagine a new DTS track to make your sub rattle and the ships whiz over your head. As far as the person who made the technical decisions for this disc. They failed...I wonder if they still drag people behind horses in some states...?<br /><br />Usually, I either love or hate a film. I don't like being gray, it can be too confusing and is usually a waste of time. But, Blade Runner is a paced epic in its own right. I recommend that anyone who watches a film to escape from reality for a couple of hours should see it. It is by no means perfect, but atleast it takes time to breath. That's a hard quality to find now a days.rag people behind horses in some states...? <br />  <br />Usually, I either love or hate a film.

B000068FY0|5.0|SUPERTRAMP ARE ONE OF THE BEST ROCK GROUPS AROUND.I HIGHLY RECOMEND CRIME OF THE CENTURY AND BREAKFAST IN AMERICA WHICH I OWN.NOT A SUPERTRAMP FAN,IF YOUR NOT YOUR MISSING OUT ON GREAT MUSIC.
B00004RFFS|4.0|This would have to be one of the better vampire films.<br /><br />Anne Rice authored the famous novel over a relatively short time after the tragic death of her daughter. In this case, the creative process aided the grieving process and turned her into one of the most read gothic novelists in twentieth century history.<br /><br />Rice's screenplay is true to form, and the production value of the film is first rate. Before the film's release, there was a lot of noise regarding the casting. When Tom Cruise heard about the film, he lobbied hard, contacted his influential connections, and pulled a few strings, landing the coveted role of The Vampire Lestat. All the noise came from Anne Rice, because she didn't want Cruise to play the part. In so many words, Anne believed he was not capable of playing the charismatic vampire, as the character of Lestat is a complex one, requiring a certain cosmopolitan class and aplomb. Cruise won the role anyway as writers in Hollywood, as is well known, hold little power. In the end, however, surprisingly, Cruise managed to put in one of the best performances of his career. Lestat came to life and the film has slowly turned into a cult classic that can be viewed time and time again.<br /><br />Rice's novel and the screenplay are exceedingly clever because the vampire is used as a metaphor for the human condition. The character of Louie is a representative of everyman - angry at the seeming absurdity of our existence. He loses his beloved wife and child and falls into a deep grief, hates the world and wishes only to die. The Vampire Lestat, in search of a companion out of his own loneliness, offers Louie a new lease on life...or death. Emotionally and physically at rock bottom, Louie accepts Lestat's offer of immortality and takes the plunge. Louie becomes a reluctant vampire because killing, he believes, is against his nature. This is the human condition: our moral inclinations and our basic instincts constantly at war. Louie rejects his new nature as a killer, however, he's no longer human - he now exists in no-mans land neither human or vampire, but as Lestat constantly reminds him, he must make a choice. This is existentialism in its purist representation, that there is no such thing as \\"human nature\\", and what we are, and what it means to be human, (or vampire) are always a matter of decision - there's no correct choice - only choices. In other words, man is nothing else but what he makes himself. Louie made a choice to join the dark side and then could not take responsibility for that choice, hence his angst about his true identity. Brad Pitt put in a believable performance as the reluctant vampire as we could feel his angst, his frustration concerning his new identity.<br /><br />This is one of those films that can be pulled off the shelf occasionally and enjoyed, no matter how many times it's seen. This is an excellent story from an entertaining as well as philosophical point of view.ects his new nature as a killer, however, he's no longer human - he now exists in no-mans land neither human or vampire, but as Lestat constantly reminds him, he must make a choice.

B00002Z88D|5.0|I was edgy when i bought this album, I am a lifelong Metallica Fan and so i didnt know quite what to expect. <br />When i first played 'Nothing Else Matters' i was truely blown away, and then Metallica's Heavy riffs begin to kick in on 'Master of Puppets' 'Sad But True' and the epic 'Enter Sandman'. Every track on this album has an orchestral symphony written for that track, and Micheal Kamen carries it off superbly. I bought this album over a year ago, and i havnt stopped listening to it since. The power of the music on this album makes you forget what Metallica sounded like WITHOUT a 100+ piece orcestra playing with them. If you want to be truely astounded, buy the DVD to go with it. <br /> <br />A full 10/10 performance by everybody involved! <br /> <br />Anybody who appreciates good music will simply love this album, fair enough i was sceptic when i bought it, but i havnt looked back since!
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama's \\"Dreams from My Father\\" is one of the few really good memoirs written by a post-Civil Rights generation African-American that is not hip-hop or gang-culture oriented. <br /> <br />Along with his personal path to self-discovery and confronting his status due to his mixed heritage, we get a lot of insight of what African-Americans who grew up on the 1970s and 80s (as I did a few years after Mr. Obama) went through. We also get some rather pointed, but not mean-spirited criticism of the rhetoric oriented politics of Black nationalism of the 1990s and of Min. Louis Farrakhan and his followers in particular. Fortunately, Mr. Obama offers some constructive alternative solutions along with his constructive cirticism of this phenomenon. <br /> <br />The current edition of this book closes with the 2004 Democratic Convention Speech that is Mr. Obama's current claim to fame. Aside from a few dated references to the John Kerry campaign and the red state/blue state controversy, future readers should also be inspired by this work that appeals to unity and not division, unlike so much of the political rhetoric of recent times. <br /> <br />Overall, a great piece of work from a voice that many people hope to hear more from in the future. <br /> <br />
0783233477|5.0|I've read quite a few of the reviews here and found I just had to reply to those stating that this movie was to long.  In my opinion this movie would have lost so much if it had been shorter.  There isn't any part in it that I could even imagine taking out.  I would suggest that if you don't like long movies don't watch it.  Everyone else, I can't even express the enjoyment I got from see it.  Brad Pitt's acting in this film is the best I have seen from him ever.  And his wasn't the only one.  If there is one thing this movie will do for you, it will make you feel.  The subject is one that touches us all whether we want it to or not.  Death is a part of life.  This film makes you think.  And that is the mark of a story that will last.

All the hostility toward this movie only proves that people attack what they cannot understand.  Scarlett and Bill were fantastic and Sofia did a great job as writer/director.  I must admit, even though I thought The Virgin Suicides was good, I was not too impressed with Sofia's direction.  However, with Lost In Translation, you can bet I am waiting axiously for her next project.    For those of you who didn't like it, stick to your Scooby Doo 2 and all the other hollywood crap that comes out every year.    Alrato!  Peace...

They made the difference and for that reason both were nominated for Best Supporting actor that year , though the Oscar went to Karl malden hands for A streetcar named Desire .<br /><br />Nominated also for Best film and Best Musical score , Photograph , Set up , Decoration and Dress  Wardrobe . And despite the fact the film didn't win any Academy Award the time has preserved to this film a honorable place among the Best films about this painful period of the story .<br /><br />The destruction of Rome and the cynicism of Ustinov is simply a tour de force experience .

Like most filmgoers, I first saw this amazing actor flaunting his talent in Quentin Tarentino's \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" a decade ago. Obviously, I haven't seen every Tim Roth film, but every one that I have seen him in is usually good. Even if the film itself isn't that great, Roth still shines. Consider his small but critical role in Tarentino's \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" With barely any screen time he still managed to contribute something special to the scenes he appeared in. The same goes for Peter Greenaway's \\"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover,\\" which I think was Roth's first film role. He showed up in only a couple of scenes, yet stood out in a stellar cast that included Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren. Another great Roth movie is \\"Rob Roy,\\" where he plays a depraved prot&eacute;g&eacute; of a character played by John Hurt. Again, this actor easily held his ground. All of this blather brings me to \\"Legend of 1900,\\" a marvelous picture that shows Tim Roth can do the leading man thing just as easily as he can work in a supporting role. I guess I can understand some people not liking Roth, but I don't understand why they don't like this movie. It's a gem.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place on one of those luxurious ocean liners so popular as a means of transportation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One day, a grunt from the engine room named Danny (Bill Nunn) discovers an abandoned baby in the ship. Not knowing what to do about such a startling find, he decides to keep the little guy and raise him as his own son. With the help of some of his fellow employees, Danny also decides to name the infant 1900 as a tribute to the start of the new century. You would think a young baby on board an ocean liner might draw attention, but Danny keeps 1900 out of sight for years by keeping him in the engine room during work hours and in the sleeping quarters the rest of the time. The ship's crew is so busy dealing with the passengers that they hardly have time to notice one kid wandering around from time to time. But when a young 1900 hears a piano playing in the ship's lounge, he strolls inside for a closer look and ends up playing some tunes for the amazed passengers. When someone notifies the captain, he realizes the profit in having this young prodigy stay on and play the piano for the passengers. After Danny perishes in an accident, 1900 becomes a sort of mascot for the ship as well as its star music attraction. Most importantly, he never leaves the ship.<br /><br />We learn about the story of 1900 through a series of flashbacks from his best friend and fellow musician Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince). His story positively enthralls the owner of pawnshop to whom Max is attempting to sell his trumpet. For example, when Max first signed up to play with the ship's band, his inability to acquire his sea legs led to long bouts of nausea until 1900 stepped into the picture. He took the trumpet player on a most memorable tour of the lounge--you need to see it to believe it--that miraculously cures his seasickness and turns the two men into fast friends. Max also relates a lengthy story about 1900's duel with legendary musician Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). The jazz great, amazed and angered to hear that a white musician on this ship plays the piano better than he does, arrives onboard to show this upstart who is the boss. After a lengthy back and forth battle of the ivories, good old Jelly Roll retreats with his tail between his legs. The story never reaches a wider audience because 1900 won't leave the ship and he won't record his music. His failure to do both of these things, even for the girl he falls in love with (played by Melanie Thierry), leads to obscurity and ultimate doom.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film. Roth does his usual bang up job as the melancholy yet supremely talented piano player 1900. His monologue delivered to Max towards the end of the film,explaining why he could never find it in his heart to leave the ship, is a wonderful piece of acting. Pruitt Taylor Vince was a good choice to play 1900's best friend and sometime confidant, and he also provides some much needed comic relief when the movie turns serious. The best part of the film, however, has to be the music, which should not come as a surprise considering this is a film where music essentially acts as a co-star. None other than the great Ennio Morricone scored \\"Legend of 1900,\\" and he did his usual fabulous job. The movie, I think, even won Morricone a Golden Globe award. As good as these elements are, I did have one problem with the movie: the CGI effects. The filmmakers often used computers to create the ship, and they also used them to create a whole city when 1900 makes his lone attempt to leave the boat. You know how there are good CGI and bad CGI effects? \\"Legend of 1900\\" uses bad CGI. Still, this small difficulty rarely intrudes on the story and does not act as a deterrent to enjoying the film.<br /><br />I also liked the extras on the DVD if for no other reason than hearing the song Roger Waters composed for the film. Called \\"Lost Boys Calling,\\" it's always great to hear the former front man for Pink Floyd recording new music. Aside from the music video for this song, the disc offers us a trailer and filmographies. Give this one a shot if you like colorful, introspective European films.ing why he could never find it in his heart to leave the ship, is a wonderful piece of acting.

B000002AZ8|5.0|absolutely mind blowing, the best 90s album, its so great , & takes a long time to grow on you <br /> <br />but its worth it
B000002L9J|5.0|For 6.99, you will not find a better album for the money on this site, bar none. This is my favorite Smiths album (Louder than Bombs comes close but ...), and they could charge 25.00 for this album and it would be worth every penny. I love the Smiths, always have, and probably always will. For all the reuniting that goes on today with has-been bands, I would walk over crushed glass to see Morrissey and Marr get it together again. And if they had Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce, it would make it so much better, as they were brilliant players all. Why oh why are we forced to listen to the crap that is out there today while these guys leave us with a legacy of incredible music that was obviously too short of a career? Maybe love or the bomb will bring them together????<br />Morrissey and Marr..if you read this, give your heads a big shake..and call each other NOW!!!! Modern music needs you to overlook your differences and make at least one more album...your solo careers will never be what the two of you were together..sorry to say.
B000002BFZ|5.0|the most diverse Pearl Jam album, a great album altogether <br /> <br />I agree with Pearl Jams Lion who compared it to the Velvet Underground <br /> <br />Its one of Pearl Jams greatest, its classic, & has to be added to your collection
B000001FA4|5.0|all I can say is U2 changed the sound of music when they recorded this fantastic album . I have always been a U2 fan and had their previous albums , but when I got this album for Christmas back in 1984 . I actually cried while listening to the beauty of the songs on this record . I mean \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" is the most beautiful song ever written , \\"A Sort Of Home Coming\\" is a song while listening to you just picture yourself in the song and escape with it , \\"Promenade\\" is so soothing , relaxing and beautiful !!! , \\"Wire\\" is an electrifying song , \\"Indian Summer Sky\\" lifts you up into the clouds while listening to it , \\"Pride ( In The Name Of Love)\\" is nothingless than pure perfection . This whole collection of songs are priceless , perfect and should get the higehst respect any album that was ever made should get . I guess all I can really say is AMEN to Bono , Larry , The Edge and Adam for giving us the best music that will go on into history as the best album ever made ! Thanks you U2 .... I love you guys !!!!Ed Kary
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana never embodied the sound known as \\"Grunge\\". Sure, they had the fashion down pat, but they didn't have the raw honesty that their contemporaries did. Listen to the debut album of the Gits, and when you hear Mia's lonely, introspective voice, you'll understand what it means to be shy and alienated. Nirvana's Nevermind never had the thoughtfulness and self-awareness that Frenching the Bully had. Nevermind also never had any insight or deeper meaning. Kurt Cobain just faked his way into your hearts with his whines and complaints, and y'all fell for it. It's heartbreaking that those so happy about life get their lives cut short while bottomfeeders like Kurt Cobain get everything they've never deserved. <br />
0780626966|5.0|all movies look great remasterd, if you like the series ther in no reason why you wont enjoy this boxset, the special features disc alone is worth the price, you have a game where you have to collect iteams to view rare footage,interviews etc, then you have a documentry that runs at 1 hour. then there are 2 easter eggs which are just amazing, so the special features disc as you can probab;y tell is the best, then also having your fav movies on dvd as to having them on vhs is also nice. so if you liked all the movies befor as a child or even adult then pick this up, i might seem like too much $ to put out, but you will be happy you did.
B000667GFK|5.0|Being from Mexico City I have to say that this CD is an excellent representation of the beautiful and incomparable mariachi music. Most of the songs are classical Mariachi songs that you will hear everywhere in Mexico. Luis Miguel puts his whole soul in each and every one of the songs. Also the arrangements are really good and the whole CD sounds so cheerful and refreshing that you will want to hear it again and again!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This movie takes some time developing the utter misery that is <br />Shaun's life and it is rather deliberate doing so.  However, after it begins, it gets really far out with a quickness.  Taking <br />pictures of the zombies and making some of the silly decisions <br />that normally get you killed.  Some of the zombies look great. <br />Also,  Shaun's best friend is the biggest moron you will ever  <br />see; that's a good thing.  Hey, if they want to get killed it  <br />doesn't cost me anything right? Enjoy it for what it is.

Need I say more? <br /> <br />You won't regret reading this book.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|If only EVERY band could put together this kind of a package. It is truly brilliant - from long-lost outtakes and footage to obscure interviews, every second of this more than 5-hour set is pure entertainment and captures the excitement and energy that catapulted a band with NO AIRPLAY to the top of the metal world. An absolute MUST-HAVE for any Iron Maiden fan - serious or casual, and I would say a MUST-HAVE for any fan of good hard rock or metal. Astounding, and worth every penny!
B00000JCOV|5.0|First off, no, Slipknot is not metal. They are Nu-Metal (Hard Rock with metal influences). Why? Because they play music with a standard rock song structure (basic three-chord riffs and such, as opposed to actual metal, which is much more complex in song structure.) <br /> <br />Second, they DID NOT copy Mushroomhead -_-;;; Both of these bands get along quite well, in fact. The whole \\"feud\\" idea came from the fans and the fans only, both sides of which thought the one band was copying the other. In fact, neither of these bands are, and there was even a band before them that wore masks and jumpsuits. So please, before you criticize a band and say they suck, learn a little about them first. <br /> <br />As far as this album goes, its very awesome. I used to not be interested in them much and thought they were rather weird. But I went online and downloaded a song, by name \\"Wait and Bleed\\" and thought, \\"I gotta give this band a try.\\" So I went out and bought the s/t album, and from the start I knew I was getting into something wild that I could really enjoy listening to. This album rocks and rocks hard, fast, and heavy. Anybody new to Slipknot should definitely give this piece a listen. <br />I won't go into details about the songs, cause most of the reviews I've read have already done so ;) <br /> <br />Oh, by the way, if you don't like this band, keep it to yourself. Nobody cares whether or not you like them, especially not the band. Listen to \\"Spit It Out\\" and pretend Corey is talking to you :/ (That is, if you even know what that song means) <br /> <br />Rock on, Slipknot \m/
6300181553|5.0|Ah, the joys of the holidays.  Holiday Inn is indeed one of those films that highlights the season and the seasons after.  It is pure enjoyment at its best, and to top that off you've got Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire as the headliners.  Yes, the film appears somewhat outdated and politically incorrect (the scene with Crosby and one of his female cohorts singing and dancing with black painted faces) and campy at times, but at the time, it was all fun.<br /><br />The film's scenes take place on a soudstage, but that's not so bad because we get to see fake snow falling around the inn to give that wintry feeling that all things end with happy endings. In addition, Crosby introduces \\"White Christmas\\" for the first time for the World War II crowd.  It only goes to show that there is always hope during troubled times.<br /><br />The plot is simple, and centers around rivalries between the male and female characters (Crosby, Astaire, little know female leads, Marjorie Reynolds and Virginia Dale).  Crosby decides to leave show business behind to a quieter mode.  He ends up running a county inn that operates during the holidays, which includes Lincoln's Birthday as well as Easter!<br /><br />This is a great holiday film that provides the song and dance numbers as well as the significance of commemoration.  At the time the film was made, there was a need to provide moviegoers the opportunity to forget their worries and come to 'Holiday Inn.'  So, I recommend this classic musical for its simplicity and musical numbers.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I've watched these films over and over and never tire of them - the extended versions are even better because they add to the story - the films are beautiful, powerful and engaging - how anyone can watch these and not fall in love with the story and the characters is beyond me. If you loved the onscreen versions of the films, you will especially love these extended versions.
B000065V41|5.0|I can remember, when I was a young child, I would watch this movie several times during each holiday season.  This exciting, entertaining, heart-warming, endearing, and educational movie is quite amazing.  Yet, these words really do not give justice to this great great movie.  No words can describe the emotions and love that come with this masterpiece.  Focusing on the key elements of the original \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens, this movie goes beyond what many \\"A Christmas Carol\\" movies can do.  It is SO faithful to the original story it is a astonishing.  This version is better than any before it.  Many of the other versions of the novel by Dickens are morbid and sad, while the Muppet version keeps kids entertainment levels extremely high... it even includes some of the best Muppet songs ever created.  So while many holiday movies are \\"same old - same old,\\" A Muppet Christmas Carol brings the best of the season, teaching life-long values, and giving the GREATEST HOLIDAY MOVIE PERFORMANCE EVER.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Wow, Most people know that she lip syncs her whole concert, but what I wonder is if they care that it means she has virtually no talent.
B000001FSR|5.0|A friend of mine describes Tom Waits as sounding like Bruce Springsteen with throat cancer!  Tom's songs are filled with coughing, singing out of tempo, sour notes, and of course that horrendous voice of his.  It's sort of like a garbage can's rotting contents of music.  But dammit, it's really good!  It's catchy, believe it or not - if you are not already a fan.  Because he breaks all the rules it makes you wonder what it is that \\"good\\" music consists of.  Mozart would probably tear his hair out if he heard it, but dammit, Tom Waits is really good!
B0001AP158|5.0|Bought this DVD the day it came out, but just writing a review cause I saw so many negative comments.  <br /> <br />Great DVD - I was at the Friday night taping @ The Borgata in Atlantic City, NJ and can tell you that watching this brings back more memories then I thought possible. This was the last show of 12 concerts I have seen him at, and obviously the most intimate. I think there were only 3000 seats each night. <br /> <br />Anyhow, if you liked the \\"This Left Feels Right\\" album, this is a must have.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Didn't buy it yet, but... speaking for the move <br /> <br />It was the definition of hilarious, buy, buy, seriously, it's great for adults and teens, this is hilarious
B00005JN4O|5.0|This movie is as touching as they come. It tells the story of J.M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, and how his inspiration for it came about. This film takes the audience back in time, to a place they can hardly remember, a Neverland. A place where simply believing in something makes it so. <br />This film is a truly amazing one, I recommend to everyone, young and old, coward or knight, rich or poor. This film could just be the thing that takes you back to Neverland.
B000000OU0|5.0|I am not going to repeat what all the other reviewers have already written. Suffice it to say that, though Eagles were primarily a rock band, to this day, their music defies categorization. In an effort to classify their music, people call their brand of music, folk rock, country rock, California rock and so on. The Eagles predominantly played during a time when some of the greatest rock bands of all time were at their best. They pass the litmus test for genius, given the fact that they could stand out among all those talented artists of their generation.  <br /> <br />\\"Hell Freezes Over\\" is a good primer for someone who is new to Eagles, since it has a bit of almost all varieties of music that they played. Their most popular songs like \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" and \\"Hotel California\\" has been played in almost all radio stations from Seattle to Siberia. The live version of Hotel California on this album sounds better than the original. From heavy numbers like \\"Get Over it\\" and \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" to melodious songs like \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\" and \\"Desperado\\", this is a treat for your ears (not to mention the ubiquitous numbers \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"Tequila Sunrise\\").  Even if you are not a rock aficionado, I can assure that you will find this album enjoyable. This will spin in my CD player for a lot more years to come! Must buy!! <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|Dogville is one of the rare movies that leaves me totally spellbound by its end. This is a movie about the essential evil of man. It raises the fact that evil exists and bears its head in the face of weakness, jealousy, greed and lust. The evil seen in Dogma knows no end and is a stranger to the idea of mercy. Revenge rules and no one is above their baseness. Nicole Kidman's acting was totally real, so real that I almost couldn't stomach the scenes in which the men of the town raped and shackled her. The format of the film was great the narration provided a good third party view of the small in bread town in which no objective observers are to be found. The films primary focus is on the characters and their relationships and is totally absent of sets which I think draws focus to the central issues of the film and away from visual sensationalism so common in so many American films today. I do not see the film as anti American or even American at all as the themes are very much universally applicable to the human condition as a whole. In the end this is a great film which raises and attempts to resolve central questions of mans nature. The film address this age old question of evil in its own innovative way. For me at least this film helped me reconcile myself with my notion of evil,. A great film.
B00005JLEX|5.0|One of the best tv shows ever is finally available on DVD. I have been waiting for this day ever since the show ended. This \\"show about nothing\\" is funny, quirky, and weird at times. Its a show about a New York comedian, his 3 best friends, and the crazy situations they get themselves into. Although it pushes the envelope on reality, most of us know someone that we can imagine doing these crazy things that Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer do. That's why the show became such a hit. WE would never do that, but WE can imagine someone doing it. After a slow start, (belive it or not, the best show on tv almost never made it past the first episode), Seinfeld quickly became the top conversation at the cooler friday morning at work. \\"Did you see seindfeld lat night\\"? It also came to tv at a time when stand up comedy was at its hay day. A few years later, or a few years earlier, Seinfeld would not have become the hit it was. It led the way for Ray Ramono and other stand up comedians to bring their shows into our homes now. from thebijou.net movie reviews by a fan, not a critic!

B00008EY65|5.0|Hellboy is the perfect anti-hero. Born in a moment when the gates between this world and a dimension of evil stood open, his intended purpose was evil. But one of those strange chances from which action films are made catapults the newborn demon into the arms of Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). A candy bar later, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a convert to the side of good.<br /><br />Too grotesque to fit into society, massively strong and completely impulsive, Hellboy becomes a demon hunter. But he continually skirts the edge of exposure, and his brash and extreme attitude are a trial to his foster father and the agents who fund and support the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.<br /><br />When Grigori Rasputin (Karl Roden) returns to the living with the single purpose of once more forcing open the gates to evil, Hellboy joins fish man Abe Sapiens in an effort to track the evil down to its source, and, with a massive display of special effects, turn back the dark.<br /><br />The love interest (there has to be one) is Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). Like Hellboy and Abe, Liz is special. If she loses control of herself explosive fires happen - buildings burn down. Hellboy loves her, but is acutely aware of his limitations. Liz, is afraid of the power of love, fearful of what she might do in a moment of passion. Hellboy (who is inflammable) would seem to be a perfect fit, but there is a tender dysfunctionality to their relationship.<br /><br />The effects are spectacular with wild creature chases, subway chases, mortuary chases, transformations and an entire collection of onderful sets. But the film really has much more to offer than its eye-candy. The script, which could easily have become a string of banalities, has real meat to it, and the central characters may be impossible, but they are entirely believable. Director Guillermo del Toro has found the heart of an action film and created an inadvertant classic.<br /><br />Make a point of seeing this.

B000005Z0E|5.0|this is 2pac's debut album it definately doesn't disappoint.  this is cleary 2pac's most underrated album of them all.  this album is a lot better than people make it out to be.  everyone should buy this album.
B000066C1N|5.0|This CD, while it may not appeal to some people, really makes my day every time I listen to it. The music and lyrics evoke beautiful images, some from the movie and others from my imagination. The CD is both soothing and exciting at the same time. I love it.
B000002P7R|5.0|The music in this CD is not five stars, to be honest with you. Many of these are unfinished tracks, jams, and second class performances  from Jimi Hendrix. Why five stars then? Because this is what the fans want. We want everything there is in the vaults from Jimi. And it is extremely rare that a record company authorizes albums for the hardcore fans. Instead you get the usual greatest hits I, II, III, ultimate hits, oldies but goodies, etc.  This is an album that only exists because the Hendrix family had Jimi's fans in mind. That's why I am giving this a 5 star rating. You shouldnt buy this album before you have acquire all Hendrix authorized albums and all the auithorized live recordings. But for the long time fans, this is a welcome compilation of rare and out of print stuff.
B0002S947K|5.0|I first heard the song \\"Trouble\\" on a local radio station, KFOG (known for playing little known or local artists). First thinking it was Tracy Chapman (!), I sat rapt in my living room, chills running up and down my spine, pen in hand, and ready to write down the artist's name when the song was complete. I bought the album on the day it was released and was not disappointed. For those of you looking for a unique new musician to take reign in your CD player, this is it. Ray's hauntingly soon-to-be familiar voice steals its way into your mind, replaying itself whenever the album is not on, rendering you a staring-into-space enthusiast. <br /> <br />Favorites on the album include \\"Jolene,\\" with lyrics not soon to be forgotten and a melody that you long to sing along with at first listen. \\"Shelter\\" has a quick-then-slow beat that will leave your fingers tapping out of rhythm, but your soul humming along. The closing \\"All the Wild Horses\\" is probably best listened to in a dark room, alone, with a glass of wine and perhaps a candle or two lit, so you can doze off in bliss. And \\"Hannah\\" is beautiful, and I love the female harmony, a voice that slides up and down the scale with ease. The album plays out beautifully, with a few upbeat songs thrown in among the slow, melodic litter. Ray's voice is truly unique, and his meek appearance belies his voice completely. This is definitely my favorite new album of the decade. <br />
1570429596|4.0|It is about money-producing assets and about money-wasting assets. It is about knowing the difference and developing the discipline to spend your hard earned dollars on assets that grow and not spending them on assets that waste. If you have discipline and some basic knowledge of money you can have money work for you. There is no point of working for a significent amount of money unless you learn to have money work for you. If not, you will be a slave to money which is typical of many workaholics.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Think of any guitar player alive, and it's more than likely they'll be on this dvd, although it is a shame that Jeff Beck was not included in this package. Like everyone else has said, there is some you'll like, and some you won't, but it encompasses every genre of music where the guitar holds a prominent position. My favorite performances were Sweet Home Chicago, Six Strings Down, and Rock Me Baby, along with anything else by Clapton in the festival, and ZZ Top. <br /> <br />By the way, don't listen to this idiot P. Duffy who basically says that Billy F. Gibbons of ZZ Top is not a great guitar player. He's a retard. Billy is great. Clapton thinks so, and that's all that matters. <br /> <br />
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Let me start by saying that I love Daredevil in all his comic book incarnations (see my other reviews) and I love both Frank Miller and Brian Michael Bendis, so I'm open to different interpretations of the character.  But I thought the movie as shown in theatres was 'da suck.'    The big problem was that it felt like the guts of the movie were missing.  It felt like it jumped jarringly from his childhood to his injury in the church and then back around again.  By contrast, this movie takes its time in his childhood, giving his experience with his father more emotional weight.  The church scene still seems out of place but at least you care more.    The best addition is that the subplot of Coolio's trial has been added back into the story.  I didn't know it when I saw this movie in the theatre, but practially every scene in the second act of the movie ended with someone moving this trial along.  You should watch this just to know how much you missed!  The trial was actually a well-done murder mystery, and it gave Jon Favreau and even Ben Affleck more of a chance to be actors.    Another plus is that the sex scene with Elektra has been axed.  Instead of going home with her, Daredevil has to leave her to help a stranger in trouble.  The scene is very well done and feels much more like Matt Murdock.    Also, the fight scene with Kingpin has been extended and feels much more significant.  The breaking of the knees makes more sense and therefore no longer feels cheesy.    This movie is still flawed.  Ben Affleck is better but still not quite right.  Jennifer Garner is a lovely actress but she still looks silly kicking sandbags with little devils painted on them.  And I still get taken out of the story every time a minor character is named John Romita or Joe Quesada (famous Daredevil artists).  Most importantly, I DO NOT BUY DAREDEVIL AS A KILLER!!!  Why would he practice law and then go out and kill people?  But there is so much that is better about this version that I have to congratulate them for releasing it.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|cruise and foxx do a great job supporting their roles, and it's a pretty entertaining movie (until the horribly cheesy ending).  there are way too many flaws in the script, which i'm not going to elaborate on so i don't spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it...but you'll see exactly what i'm talking about once you do. <br /> <br />overall- being a big tom cruise fan, it's awesome seeing him take on the role of a bad guy and cruise's scene in club fever is absolutely phenomenal!  so, this is what made watching collateral worthwhile. <br /> <br />i wouldn't recommend buying this movie for anything over $8-$10 new, but it's defenately a worthy rental. <br /> <br />i guess i was expecting a little more out of the story in collateral, and i'm sure that anyone who is into the action/suspense type genre will understand what i mean after they have seen it.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I got this DVD about a week ago and I have watched it about 8 times since. The White Stripes are RAW ROCK AND ROLL PERFECTION!!! Their music is the most honest rock I have ever heard. You can see the passion for their music in every strum of Jack's guitar, and every beat of Meg's drum. I recomend this DVD to all White Stripes fans...I guarantee you will fall in love with them all over again!  :)
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is the most overrated piece of junk ever released by the most overrated and untalented band in the world. I don't get what people find in this album it has too many annoying drum beats, the solos don't even make sense, the bassist sounds so bad it's as if he was drunk while he was playing and the singer whao I didn't even want to go there. Axl w. Rose my god was he the most boring untalented singer since Bruce Dickinson and Geoff Tate. All Rose does is scream into the mic senselessly and I know this for a fact because as many of you noticed by now I like to watch music videos so there I was watching VH1 classics one day and I see this band come on playing the song Welcome to the Forest or something like that and I kept thinking to myself who are these lipstick,tight pant-wearing clowns with long hair and most importantly who actually considers these guys hard rock when you have your Avenged 7folds, clay aikens, ruben studdards and white stripes. Any of those bands takes out these guys
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This movie was really good. The acting was great and by the time the movie is over, you hardly realized that you spent 2 hours watching it. Cruise looks cool with the grey hair and Jaime Fox did an excellent job.<br /><br />ruggedthug.com
0316666343|1.0|The main character's loneliness would have been more believable if she were in the in-between.  Then she \\"drops\\" from Heaven into a body and the 1st thing she wants to do is have sex?? Because she spied so much on her family, it would have made more sense that she would try to lead someone to her killer or see/touch her family.<br /><br />The book, especially the ending is a joke (see how the murderer is killed).  I actually laughed out loud.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, rent it from the library like I did.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I had to work the day of Live Aid, and my friend went and took about 20 rolls of film.  She had just bought a new camera, and when we got the pictures back, they were all BLANK!!  She did not load the film properly.   <br /> <br />I am THRILLED this came out on DVD!!  I just ordered her a copy, and am glad to know the proceeds go to charity.  I hope I made her Christmas a little more special. <br /> <br />
068987474X|5.0|I picked up this book to see if my current guy was anywhere in it.  Though he wasn't specifically in it, I found him in between the lines as the \\"guy who isn't into you\\" because he's a guy who thinks of love as a noun rather than a verb.  That's the sum of this book - a guy who's into you ACTS that way and TEACHES you THAT WITHOUT QUESTION.  I loved that the authors succinctly suggest that basically life is too short to give \\"Mr. Not Into You\\" the right to waste it, and that your life and you are too precious and too one of a kind to waste - period.  As the author's say \\"Don't waste the pretty.\\"  This book helped me put a period on my confidence to let go of the \\"current guy\\".  While I miss what I enjoyed of him, it was obvious that he wasn't that into me.  And I want a guy who's that into me. --Thanks, LIz and Greg.

B00005JMJG|2.0|This movie starts out kinda slow and boring.  So stick with it if you want it to make sense.  It gets better, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.<br /><br />The movie is too serious to be very funny, and too silly to be taken seriously.  The story starts in the middle and catches back up with itself in a somewhat unique way, but that's probably the most interesting part.  If you like movies that feature loose sexual morality, then you might enjoy it, but it's really a slow paced movie.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine replaces The Cable Guy as my least favorite Jim Carey movie.  I really think Carey is a great actor, but I thought he was too old for this role.
B00000DQSV|3.0|The 1985-86 period was a tough time for Duran fans, most were disillusioned by the Power Station/Arcadia side projects, Simon's yachting adventures and the Live-Aid \\"performance\\". All this was enough to have had many a loyal Duranie wondering is it all over? Added to that was the departure of founder members Roger and Andy Taylor? So could Duran, against all odds, confound everyone and come back with their best album?  <br /> <br />Unfortunatly no, not quite! Notorious does have it's moments though..... Notorious starts off brightly enough with it's title track and American Science which stand alongside some of their best work, Skin Trade as well is well worth a listen although the more compact Radio Cut does this song better justice! Vertigo and Winter Marches On and even So Misled also offer glimpses of what the album could have been.  <br /> <br />But it just seems that Duran lack the courage of their convictions and are struggling to come to terms with the loss of Roger and Andy! Tellingly the band recorded most of this album whilst waiting for Andy to show up ....and it shows! A Matter of Feeling is a very unoriginal Save a Prayer, Hold me is souless and Proposition is the sound of a band struggling to get some energy into the the album and falling short...something that was effortless previously.  <br /> <br />That said though Notorious is a more complete album than Seven and the Ragged Tiger which is their biggest seller (????) and certainly there was promise of better things to come.......time would tell!  <br />
B00005JMUL|5.0|I had mixed emotions about the prospects of this movie.<br /><br />I love the book. I never like seeing a book be made into a movie--even when the movies are well done.<br /><br />Add into the mix my general liking of Forest Gump and CastAway, the two previous Hanks/Zemeckis films (I feel CastAway is the far superior film if anyone's interested).<br /><br />Temper that general feeling of goodwill with the fact that Tom Hanks's last piece of GREAT acting (in my opinion) was in Joe vs the Volcano (Meg Ryan's as well)--and that CastAway was Zemeckis's last good film.<br /><br />These ingredients, as well as knowing that this film was to be a guinea pig for a new kind of animation, left me feeling unsettled at best about going to see The Polar Express.<br /><br />Yet...<br /><br />This movie blew me away.<br /><br />Say what you want about The Passion of the Christ or Fahrenheit 911 (both are great movies in the movie-making sense and should be nominated for all kinds of awards) but this is my movie of the year. It is also the best Christmas movie in quite a while.<br /><br />The movie version of The Polar Express has a whole lot to see. This is serious eye-candy. That said, the movie stays incredibly faithful to the heart of the book.<br /><br />The book and the movie are all about the wonder and joy of belief.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the great job Tom Hanks does, about the awesome animation, but I won't. For as gilded and bedecked with ornaments as this movie is, it all gets stripped down to the ringing of a silver bell.<br /><br />The sound of belief.<br /><br />Faith is the evidence of things not yet seen.<br /><br />This movie is a wonderful hymn to that evidence. An evidence readily found in all hearts brave enough to believe.<br /><br />I give the Polar Express my highest recommendation.

B00005ATQF|3.0|The first half of the movie was great and I'd rate it the full 5-stars.  Unfortunately, the second half (after boot camp) was quite poor and I'd give it 1 star.  Overall, on average I gave it 3.<br /><br />As one who actually went through Marine Corps boot camp in 1966, I found the performance of R. Lee Ermey real enough to set the hair up on the back of my neck.  It took my back ovver 30 years and opened many memories (some goos and some not so much so) but the portrayal of Marine boot camp was as real as it gets.  Once you get past the boot camp part, the movie, unfortunately, falls flat.  Kubrik's portrayal of combat in Vietnam was, well, ludicrous and, having participated in the Hue City campaign. I know.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun leads a very dull life.  His girlfriend is bored with him because all he ever wants to do is go to the local pub, the Winchester with his awful flatmate,Ed.  His co-workers despise him, and he doesn't get on with his stepfather.   <br /> <br />Shaun's life takes an unexpected turn when people suddenly start turning into zombies, and he finds himself unexpectedly taking on the role of superhero zombie-slayer.  He needs to rescue his mother, his stepfather, his girlfriend, her two dreary flatmates, and of course Ed.  Where can he take them for safety?  Why, the Winchester, of course! But will they be safe even there? <br /> <br />This is an absolutely hilarious film, with wonderful performances all round, hilarious dialogue and a gloriously surreal plot. I haven't laughed at anything so much for years. Of course, it's wildly improbable, the idea of flesh-eating zombies invading Suburbia, or is it? Unmissable.

0140177396|4.0|I read this book in first quarter at school, even though I didn't really enjoy it, but I guess that the books contains are not that bad at all.<br /><br />John Steinbeck's books are, a little bit, confusing sometimes, I may say. I have read \\"The Pearl\\" which is more confusing then this book that I am currently reviewing, anyway, let's get back to this book. Steinbeck tells the story in a confusing way, I may say, but once you get to the main plot points, you will understand where he is leading you. In this book, it is about George and Lennie, who, people would call odd, because no men would travel together anymore, during that time period, which is, 1930's I guess (I forgot). This book shows the bond of friendship and the hardship that grown up has to get over with. It starts out with getting a job at a ranch, we soon discovered that the tall and strong Lennie has a mind of a child, which makes things worst, once they got their job at the ranch. George, who is Lennie's companion, really wants to keep Lennie out of trouble, but sometimes trouble comes without you knowing it. Soon, after some time, things gets worst, and an surprised ending wraps the story all up.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein is back with another great album. In my opinion this cd is better then Mutter, even thought it might be not as hard as previous 2 cd's it's still has original new sounds and awesome melody in each track. Each track sounds different and good in it's own way. Only track that i can think of that doesnt do much for me would be nr.6 Los.
0060194995|4.0|I have to read this book for school, which we just finished it like last week. I think this book overall is pretty good, but I can't really state my opinion to the book, because I was forced to do vocabularies, answer study questions, and take a test for each chapter of the book (31 Chapters). But if I have time, I might read it again without some forcing me to read something that I wasn't ready for.<br /><br />I recommend this book to the people who is entering high school. I have heard from sophomores, juniors, and seniors that they have to read this book when they were freshmans. So, you little people below high school should get a head start on reading high school gonna-read books. This book's vocab and stuff is not hard at all, but it is like a tradition that every single one of us has to read.<br /><br />This book brought us back to the time in which the Great Depression took place, but the story didn't really link that much to the Great Depression, but it is just a reference point in which we can tell what the setting is. Our young narrator, Jean Louis Finch, who is commonly known as Scout, tells us the important events that happened in her life that leads to her brother Jem's accident. Throughout the story, it shows us, the reader that our main characters is growing and intersting events happened while they grow. Scout started her story at age seven, but the narrator Scout, in my opinion, is a grown-up Scout, and this story is like a flashback, but we'll never know, because the story never told us. That's why this book is a classical tale, because it allows you to think about the what is happening, what makes it happen, and what might happen.<br /><br />I give it a four star because I did enjoy, but not fully, because of my English teacher forcing us to read. Keep in mind, I recommend this to all middle-schoolers!
B00008PW2D|2.0|First of all, I don't have a problem with it being short-and it is, only being 8 episodes long. If Sarah Jessica Parker wants to have a baby, then she should have a baby. But if it's going to be short, couldn't the episodes have been better? Answer: Yes. Could've. <br />   When we left our four girls, Big had moved to Napa, leaving our beloved protagonist Carrie alone in the big city in my personal favorite episode, I HEART NY. Also, Charlotte decided to get over her divorce, Samantha discovered what it was like to get a broken heart, and Miranda met a new man of her life:her son Brady. These four lovely ladies start off this season freshly single, and knowing the show, it won't stay that way for too long.  <br />   New changes are in the air. To begin with, Carrie is about to publish a book of her collumns. Charlotte celebrates her 36th birthday with the girls in Atlantic City while Samantha (briefly) gets back with her ex (vile Richard) and Miranda discovers the ups and downs to having a post-baby body-and life. Sounds great, right? That's just the first three episodes. Then on the (forgettable) fourth one, Carrie walks in on Samantha, uh...uhh...having an oral session with \\"her\\" World Wide Express guy. The way that Carrie judges Samantha was just totally unrealistic and out of character for both of them-they've been friends for way too long and should've known each other better. And in the delightful fifth episode, Carrie celebrates her launch party and meets the charming (but taken) Jack Berger (played to perfection by that guy from OFFICE SPACE) and all the girls wonder why plus one is the lonliest number. And the sixth episode is just too much like the fourth-they both have the same themes of judging and it's just too seen it all before stuff. And in the seventh episode, Carrie, desperate for a man, takes Samantha with her to San Fransisco to \\"catch up\\" with Big. It's just really bad-Carrie is just too desperate and it's soo out of character for her. And asthe cherry topper of this poor episode, Charlotte gets hot and heavy with her divorce lawyer who, in short terms, isn't exactly a Calvin Klein model. I really don't have a problem with Charlotte, or any of the ladies, dating unattractive men, but the way the way that they have to magnify it and make it so obvious is just sappy and cliched. But luckily the show pulls itself together for a good last episode. It's stylish and made me wanting to see what happens in the sixth season... <br />   ...but that doesn't save it. Overall, the episodes were really dry and unoriginal. If it's only going to be eight episodes long, couldn't they be at least mediocre? Save yourself thirty dollars and four hours if you're smart
B00004TS0E|5.0|This movie is without a doubt my favorite christmas movie of all time. Richard Attenbourogh(forgive my spelling)remains one of my favorite actors of all time. He was the perfect choice to portry the greatness that is Santa Clause. The actor lineup is great, the original of this movie was good, but it pales in comparison to this one. The plot is amazing, and this film just tugs at your heart, and maybe even will spark a few tears. As you see the one of the most beloved figures in history on a trial, which literally turns into a DOES SANTA CLAUSE EXIST trial. Watch as New York city and the World come together to do what Chris Cringle nows so well, how to help others. This is a great film, and one of my favorites of all time. Does Santa exist, and the films trial ending is the greatest part of all, I BELIEVE, DO YOU.

0064407667|4.0|i would give this a 4.5 (if i could) i've heard how great lemony snicket is, so i thought i'll try it.   <br /> <br />it was a really good book. note that i said GOOD not GREAT or ALSOME. it's not as good as the happy potter series, but it's still intersting in it's own way. the book is about 3 children who had lost their parents and had to move in with a distant reltive. who is really evil and will try to get the childern's fortune no matter what. the book has some humorous and intersting narration. though i must say, the part about Count olaf trying to marry violet is quite, strange. <br /> <br />but the book's still pretty good to me cuz i'm a teen. but if ur a parent who doesn't want their kids reading this kind of stuff, i won't recommend this.
B0000033TE|5.0|After reading most of the reviews posted by other listeners (or fans, maybe...) I decided to post my own. Please bear with me. <br /> <br />I first heard this album when I was 9 years old or so. I was introduced to all sorts of new and strange music by my older brother and the older brothers of my friends. I noticed immediately that this album wasn't anything like what I would hear on the radio at the time. Bands like King Crimson, whose works up to their reformation - or reconstruction - were great (with 'Starless And Bible Black', 'Larks' Tongues In Aspic', and 'Red', not to mention 'U.S.A.', a live album, being their best work), Pink Floyd (pre Barrett, of course - I only got into him later, and now he is probably my all time favourite), and even Genesis, were becoming staples in my musical diet at the time, but nothing was as wierd as 'Brain Salad Surgery'. Incidentally, I had the good fortune of seeing them live in Toronto in 1976 or 77, around the time of 'Works'. Unfortunately, it was the first night that they had to drop the 72 piece orchestra that they had been touring with, but it was still an amazing performance, and an incredible barrage of sound. <br /> <br />I can understand why some people tend to analyse the tracks on ELP's BSS - they are all complex compositions, and meaningful in different ways to different people - but to me, the album is just one fantastic mind warp, one beautiful memory of a time that will never come again, one that takes me back to the hot summer days spent lying on my bed listening to BSS over and over and being constantly in awe of the barrage-slow crawl-build up-barrage-intensity-total destruction approach the album took - something I had never heard, or noticed, before. When I listen to it now, I get the same feeling (admittedly, I would leave out 'Benny...'). I think that, what I'm trying to say is, listen to this album like someone discovering something new. It may stay with you forever, like it has for me.
B0002S947K|3.0|Ray LaMontagne is not a genius. `Trouble' is, however, a reasonably good debut album. His music is listenable, but it is the same sound for ten tracks. By itself, any song on the album seems compelling, but when listened to in its entirety, the record betrays LaMontagne's limitations as a songwriter. Hopefully he will grow in this respect, because at this point his lyrics are pretty trite and the structure of his songs is monotonous. His voice is gravelly and soulful, but at times the soulfulness recalls Michael Bolton more than Otis Redding.  <br /> <br />The album's earthy quality (including the faded cover art) is also quite contrived; it is the musical equivalent of Starbucks. If you aren't too discerning, you may forget that this is a major label album. In spite of the almost incessant airplay on Seattle's KEXP, hipsters should proceed with caution. Any resemblance this album has to indie rock is purely coincidental; LaMontagne has more in common with Ben Harper than Daniel Johnston. If you're into Bongo drums and doobies, then I guess that's fine, but I think LaMontagne's music is only gonna get more VH-1 as time goes by. If you're in your thirties and want some innocuous background music for when you invite your advanced degree holding friends over for dinner or if you're in your twenties and have a North Face fleece and say `sweet' all the time, then this is probably the album for you. However, the record is not breaking new ground in any area, the songwriting is mediocre, and the vocals, lyrics, and music are all calculated.  <br /> <br />Sam Beam (aka Iron and Wine) gets my vote for the most important singer-songwriter to emerge in the past five years. I want to like Ray LaMontagne, but his album is flawed in too many ways, and there is little indication that future work will be an improvement.
B00062IDCO|5.0|If not just to complete your set, the Seventh Season of STAR TREK: VOYAGER stands alone as the only one of the series to have really brough the villainy of the Borg to the fore front.

B0002XVQNU|5.0|This is what it's about!!. The directors cut delivers on the well made blockbuster of the original and gives the full story behind the wonderfully photographed and atmosphericly intriguing daredevil theatrical release.  If u pause any particular shot in this film, chances are you will be looking at something that would make a great window in a graphic novel, that's how well told this tale is. The director's cut gives all the extra story and info, after seeing this cut i feel like i had read a really good graphic novel, except that the story had played out in full motion before my eyes. As much as i enjoyed the theatrical cut, it didn't give me that. great dvd!
B00005JMAH|5.0|I disagree with anyone who prefers Chris Columbus's films over Cuaron's. Unlike the first two, which I found a bit derivitive and stiff, this film is gritty, wonderfully produced, and quirky. The acting quality is also much better and good dialogue is added that wasn't in the book. This film makes the other two look like Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br />It would be nice if he came back to to Goblet, but then it may be too much of a good thing.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is a very interesting fairy tale. The imagery through out the whole thing is simple superb. Jason Isaac's is great fun in his duel roles, but the children help carry the film just fine.  The film is alot of fun, with great fairytale moments spanning from high humoured fun to melancholy poetic with just a dash of a dark underbelly in overall tone, giving a strangely wistful journey as it's heart.  A fairytale film with a definite depth.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney Spears' fourth studio album, \\"In The Zone\\" (2003) has its moments. \\"Toxic\\", the funky, orginal and addictive slice of dance pop that saturated radio and MTV in early 2004, pops into mind immediately. Toxic emmulates everything Britney Spears intended this album to be: undeniably catchy, fast-paced, club friendly and musically adventurous while still enjoyably familiar. However, most to the songs succeed in only a few, if any, of these areas, and the result is a album that leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br />The album contains the trancy songs \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", which succeeds within their respective genre, but neither does anything to make this type of music more accessible with catchy hooks, which is not necessarily a requirement as long as they bring something new or original instead. Unfortunately, they do not. They are palatable enough, but there is nothing novel here, and they lack the explosive hooks Britney fans have come to expect.  <br /> <br />Still, Britney's dappling in trance is more effective than her lamantable journey through pseudo-R&B. (I Got That) Boom Boom is the best result, a predictable Hip-Hop/Pop fusion which is decent enough, but suffers in comparision to Christina Aguilera's superior songs in this mold, namely \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" and \\"Dirrty\\". Then there's \\"Outrageous\\", the soulless R. Kelly tune, whose horrendousness stems from its unrelenting derivativeness. The lyrics are vapidly familiar (Outrageous / when I move my body / outrageous / when I'm at a party / outrageous / in my sexy jeans / outrageous / when I'm on the scene) and there is absolutely no emotion involved whatsoever. Britney speak-sings the whole song, resulting in a tuneless boring creation with little redeeming factors. To make matters worse, it plays like the new Britney Spears anthem, inadvertantely encapsalating everything that is lacking in her music and star persona at this very moment.  <br /> <br />In the end, this album proves all the more that Britney Spears is strongest when she remains true to her dance pop roots. \\"Me Against The Music\\" is far from Britney's best, but it is a standard and straight-forward dance track and one of the catchiest on the album. \\"Brave New Girl\\", a sunny and fun elctro-pop number, provides much needed respite from the darker detours into Trip-Hop and the like.  <br /> <br />Besides \\"Toxic\\", the one other true success is \\"Everytime\\", which supplies Britney with her first valid ballad. Hauntingly beautiful in its arrangement, Britney's limited vocal range almost helps here: you can tell she is trying hard on this song, and it adds an urgency that works will with the theme of this plea to a lost lover. Sadly, the success is short-lived, as Britney quickly returns to sappy form in the largely unremarkable \\"Shadow\\". The album also includes the tedious monotomy that is \\"Early Mornin'\\", the average dance track \\"The Hook Up\\" and the interesting and sexy \\"Showdown\\".  <br /> <br />Overall, the results are extremely mixed, but the message remains clear: the more Britney veers from the formula that made her huge, the more her music suffers. This is not to say that she was mistaken to step out of her swedish-pop prison, but in the future, let's hope this jailbreak is more \\"Toxic\\" than it is \\"Outrageous\\".
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I have been a fan of Twain's since the \\"Woman in Me\\" album hit stores some years ago and since then she has exploded into something of a phenomenon. And so it seems the perfect time to release a GH album to capitalize on the mania, but to me it seems a little soon (with only 3 popular albums under her belt). However, this is the perfect album for those who never took the time to buy one of her pervious albums - the perfect opportunity to play catch up (so to speak). Most of the good songs are included, of course excluding those she did not release (It Takes Two) and for some reason the loveable \\"When You Kiss Me\\" is excluded. Also, I would have loved to see her Grammy nominated version of Dolly's \\"Coat of Many Colors,\\" but otherwise they're all here. <br /> <br />The one thing that does not impress me here, however, are the new songs, particularly \\"Party for 2,\\" which almost makes my ears bleed every time I hear it. BUT, still a worthy buy any day of the week.

B00005QDW1|1.0|No Doubt, what have you done to your good name? Being an avid fan of this band, I went out and bought this CD right when it came out. I had only heard one song-&quot;Hey Baby&quot;, which I thought was decent at the time, but I figured that since this was No Doubt, the CD was guaranteed to be great. I thought wrong. &#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; &quot;Hey Baby&quot; quickly lost its appeal after I listened to the song a few times. This song has virtually no substance. What does it mean? Absolutely nothing. &quot;Hella Good&quot; had a decent beat, but that's all. The annoying reggae beat of &quot;Underneath It All&quot; turned me off the first time I heard it. In fact, the only song I can stand to listen to anymore is &quot;Making Out&amp;amp&quot;, and I'm not even sure why I bother. What really bothered me was the change in Gwen's voice. Some fans say that she has matured as a singer, but her characteristic voice is what got me listening in the first place. Now I simply get bored hearing her. &#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; Overall, this album really confused me. What is No Doubt aiming for? Hip Hop? Dance? Reggae? 80's synth pop? Being a big fan of the New Wave/Synth pop era, I must say that this is a poor attempt at recreating that music, and in fact, sounds more synthesized than any 80's music I've ever heard.&#60;br /&#62; &#60;br /&#62; Save your money for Tragic Kingdom or Return of Saturn.
B0002YLC24|5.0|BEFORE SUNSET is essentially a two-character conversation that speaks to the durability of ephemeral liaisons: moments of relationships no matter the length can impact lives  in amazing ways.  It is to the credit of Writers Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy, and Ethan Hawke that the impressions of the film BEFORE SUNRISE made nine years ago made such a lasting impact on these fine artists that they were able to create this 'sequel' in a way that speaks to each of us about events and memorable past moments.<br /><br />Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) met in Vienna nine years ago and had a brief but romantic evening, ending with a pledge to meet again in a few months to recapture their night of love.  Circumstances prevented that reunion, yet nine years later Jessie, now on a tour publicizing his latest novel (one which uses his encounter with Celine as the core for his story) meets Celine again and having only a few hours before his plane leaves for New York (around sunset), the two stroll Paris, pause in a cafe, and eventually go to Celine's Parisian apartment where Celine is invoked to sing one of her songs that in her way recalls the affair of nine years ago.  Through all of this we learn how each life has changed and grown and how that 'before sunrise' moment altered each character's worldview.  And we never know if Jessie meets his plane!<br /><br />The extraordinary aspect of this film is the script, written in a manner that seems like the entire film is based on extemporaneous conversation.  Unforced, unfettered by traditional love story telling methods, this film relies wholly upon the interaction of two very fine actors.  The cinematography is seamless giving the feeling that the afternoon stroll and conversation was filmed in one sustained shoot.<br /><br />The DVD is greatly enhanced by a conversation - with Richard Linklater who brings the whole film into focus, with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy quietly demonstrating the depth of their talent both as actors, as conceptualizers, and as writers.  This is a thinking person's film, but that is not to say it is not a beautifully romantic film. It is as rare a treasure as, say, 'My Dinner with Andre'.  Highly recommended.

B0002DKCMQ|3.0|It's not hard to see that Eurotrip was from the same branch as Road Trip and Old School. These movies just aren't that funny. You can lump them all together, stir them up, and come up with the same thing; mild amusement. It's not that they don't try, I think they just try to hard to be funnier than 80's comedies like 'Revenge of the Nerds', but fall short.<br /><br />Scotty graduates from high school and gets dumped by his girlfriend who is supposedly the biggest slut in the world, but he doesn't know. So all through the movie we get to hear the \\"Scotty doesn't know\\" song. He is email penpals with a German girl named Mike, but he doesn't know it's a girl. Which is stupid from the get go, how could you not tell the sex of someone after lots of writing? It takes his little brother to tell him.<br /><br />So to make a long story short, he and his friends end up in Europe to find his Mike. They have a run-in with the Manc soccer team in England, a dominatrix nightmare in Amsterdam, an all-male nude beach, a French Robot mime, and end up burning the pope's hat. Of course we have the lovey dovey happy ending where Mike decides to go to school in America to be with Scott. She is placed in his room because the school thought she was a guy. I think the alternate ending was much more believable, but if you want realism, this is not the movie to watch.<br /><br />This movie will give you a few chuckles, but this is no laugh out loud knee slapper. The kid who played Cooper was OK, but I think he was trying to hard to be like Stiffler from the American Pie series.
B0006399FS|3.0|It's hard to watch TV and not hear clips of \\"Vertigo\\".  Unfortunately, that is about as good as it gets for this CD.  \\"Man and a Woman\\" is a nice track too.  However, the rest of the CD spans mediocre to just hard to listen to.  \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\"  falls into the latter category.  Listening to the chorus is like being stabbed in the head with a butter knife repeatedly.<br /><br />Stick to Rattle and Hum and Joshua Tree.  This is a mere shadow of those classic U2 CDs.
B00001QEFU|5.0|I have the original UK vinyl release without &#34;I'll never grow up, now&#34;, but I wanted this CD to see the differences and have &#34;I'll never grow up now&#34; on CD.<br /><br />This is Twisted Sister at it's rawest. The songs are heavy, Dee is constantly angry, there is no ballad anywhere in sight, and the band plays tight. The title track is an awesome nightmare of going in for surgery. I love the part &#34;A monster stands before you now/ His mouth is open wide&#34;.<br /><br />All these songs rock &#34;Destroyer&#34; could be the American answer to Black Sabbath's &#34;Iron Man&#34; and &#34;Bad Boys of Rock n Roll&#34; could even knock Lemmy from Motorhead back a step or two.<br /><br />America should have been ashamed of itself in the early 80's. The New Wave of British Metal was a great time for music with bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, and Diamond Head hitting the scene. Did America have an answer? Heck yes, it was Twisted Sister. But they had to go to England to make it big and finally came back to copnquer the world with their third album 'Stay Hungry'.<br /><br />If you want to know where it all began, well I guess you'd have to dig further than this, but if you want to hear Twisted Sister's first official release, this is it. You can play this whole album without hitting the FF&#62;&#62; button once. If you like the early 80's metal before hair and glam turned into a self-parody, then you got to check this album out.<br /><br />One bit of trivia is that bassist Mark 'The Animal' Mendoza had a heavy and helping hand remixing this.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I am a film maker myself, I am also a person who is very picky when it comes to films, I have also studied film whilst watching and know what makes a good film, and what makes a below average film. When I watch Matrix: Revolutions, that is everytime I do cause I've watched it often, I've enjoyed every minute of it. Why? Simple. It is an excellent film. It has within it a great story and script (which includes the first two movies as revolutions is act III, keep that in mind), it has great directing and cinematography, it has a fantastic soundtrack and score, plus the visuals are so spectacular, the CGI and real life composition is flawless. Every character either human or program are basically taken to their endurance and 'emotional' limit as the struggle between man and machine reaches its creshendo, even Smith is pushed to such an extent. As stated in my title, the film is like a poem in which the story and characters flows in stunning emotional waves. Everytime I watch this movie and relaoded, the temple scenes with the morpheus speech and Kids 'War is over' away send shivers reverberating through my body because of how closely they relate to hope, and the survival of humanity which really is all we people got!!!    I hear a lot from people about how the movie was a disappointment in the end. I have to disagree with all of them...it really gets to me things like this, when I know something everybody else doesn't and when I try let them know...they won't hear it. What I think disappoints people is the fact the movie ended in not a straigh forward we win, they lose ending, but was much more 'deep' and 'meaningful.' Also people say it was disappointing because it didn't answer all the questions it raised. Let me just say that most of the question raised earlier on in film two are answered either visually within the film or explained by the oracle. All these other questions people want answered (you know who they are and what they are) the film is not about answeringthese questions to satisfy you. These questions mirror the questions of life, and the meaning of life. With these questions we can not just wait til the end just to be handed an explanation, we have to find our own answer, one that suits who we are as an individual.    In the end, one thing I can agree with is that the acting sometimes is a little wooden but a choice the directors made and probably didn't fully understand the consequence in the end, but the final flight of Morpheus, Trinity and Neo is one I think the next generation of film goers will bring closer to their hearts.
B00005QG9J|5.0|When I heard one of the songs on this album ('Wish you were here'), i fell in love with it and bought the CD at a nearby music shop. I absolutely adore this album now, I have listened to it constantly and every song is so catchy and different.   <br /> <br />In songs like 'circles' and 'just a phase' we see Incubus exploring the heavier sound. In 'Are you in?' the sound is almost jazzy. 'Mexico' is an example of a great acoustic guitar song and 'Aqueous transmission' shows the group's oriental influences.  A great album which shows Incubus in an experimental stage of their career.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I've just this morning recieved this DVD (I live in the UK and my local stockist of American DVD's got it in early) and there is a BIG mistake with the subtitles. <br /> <br />It only has subtitles for the hearing impaired! (IE as well as the dialogue you get bracketed titles saying Helicopter Noises, Gunfire, Crashing Sound, Singing In Japanese etc).  <br /> <br />Usually there would be 2 English tracks - 1 with just dialogue and another with dialogue + sound descriptions - but the only other English subtitle track on the disc is for the commentary. <br />  <br />Quite why this is I have no idea but I just thought I'd let everyone know this in case they were thinking of buying it. <br /> <br />The sound effect descriptions are VERY distracting and spoil the film completely.  <br /> <br />Innocence is a great film but I believe fans should boycott this disc until another version with correct subtitles is released. <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is a wonderful movie from the first laugh to the last laugh. This movie has to be the best comedy of the year. Great storyline. This is considered to be the best movie I have ever seen!! A must- buy for the whole family!
B0002V7O3S|4.0|Based on the supposedly true account of alien abductee Travis Walton, Fire in the Sky is creepily effective in it's storytelling and presentation.  D.B. Sweeney plays the logger who, along with his co-workers, witnesses bizarre lights hovering in the sky.  Travis attempts to get a closer look, and is seemingly beamed aboard and never seen again until five days later.  While the events in the film differ from Walton's own account, Fire in the Sky manages to get under your skin once Travis has a flashback of the events that transpired aboard the spaceship.  The alien beings are surprisingly well designed, and the ordeal Travis goes through will make your skin crawl despite the film's PG-13 rating.  It's not perfect, but the cast (including T2's Robert Patrick, Peter Berg, Craig Sheffer, and James Garner) makes it work.  All in all, if you are one of the many people who zone out to the X-Files and UFO phenomina, give this a look.
B00006RINF|5.0|I got this album from a friend about the time it came out and have to say that its one of my favorite albums, but first off I'd have to disagree that the band lacks good musical talent IE (the guitars). Now im a musician and a guitarist/bassist at that and can tell you right now that not all bands purpose is to write technical metal! DUH! if thats what youre looking for then (opeth, yngwie malmsteen)is what youre looking for and that's not what this band is about, to me it's about atmosphere and powerful guitars that you can feel as well as the full wave of music that hits you while you are listening,(chills). Now as for the person who said that the bassist doesnt stand out or \\"just writes along with the rhythm guitars\\".. That's absolutly not true especially in Unleashed Memories which is another great album by them.. The bassist is very creative as well as conservative as he plays, an over the top jazz bassist would not fit and would probably take away from the music. He is a well balanced mixture with their music and i appreciate him as well as the whole band.I for one know how difficult it is to create good music and respect them! Lacuna Coil Rocks!
B000002H33|1.0|This could be one of the worst records ever released.  The guitars and bass sound more like chainsaws than musical instruments.  The drums sound like somebody breaking cement with a jackhammer.      And the vocals...James Hetfield's monotonous roar sounds like a horse grunting.  Not to mention that he looks like one too.  That proves just how bad Metallica is.  Their greatest artistic acheivement is having the most horse-like hairstyles of any band in the music business!  I am appauled!    Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.  Just because Hetfield has the most horse-like hairstyle is no reason to listen to their music.  I think Metallica is the worst band of the late 80s/early 90s.  (...)
0802130208|5.0|Do not read this book in public because your laughter will cause others around you to think you are crazy.  <br /> <br />This was the funniest book I have ever read.  Once you get to know Ignatious and what makes him tick, everything that comes out of his mouth will have you laughing hysterically. Though at times you feel sorry for the guy, you can't help laugh at the life he has made for himself.  Will Ferrell is playing him in the movie version which is coming out in 2005 - so read this before the movie.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Of, course, you will enjoy this the most if you have alreadyenjoyed the TV episode. But my bet is that, even if you did not, you will find this a very pleasant musical ride. The songs are good, orchestration tight, the Buffy actors do a reasonable job singing, everything's in the right place. I simply love the album, which by the way I was lucky managing to download it from Suprnova (by the way, the site was shut down yesterday. Dammit!)
630463949X|5.0|As a general fan of music, I listen to all genres and virtually anything between Beethoven and Modest Mouse.  I even enjoy the music and songwriting of a few key bands from the 80s, 90s, and new millenium.  However, musical talent and live singing abilities of many new bands leave a bit to be desired without the advancing technology of studios and computers to fine-tune and over-produce the sound to something the artist is incapable of without electronic help. <br /> <br />When older bands such as Fleetwood Mac or the Eagles decide to reunite, as evidenced on DVD/CD releases like The Dance or Hell Freezes Over, the raw live talent both vocally and instrumentally, together with the superbly crafted melodies and brilliant songwriting, flat-out embarrass most current bands. <br /> <br />In The Dance, the superb harmony of the band shows the incredible inate talent and skill each possesses even as they age and their voices fall off a bit.  Mick Fleetwood and John McVie lay down the most superb and perfectly timed rythm for each song as a tempo for the others to feel and match.  Christine McVie shows excellent timing and tune with her keyboard, adding depth to each track and supplying the necessary third to the voices of Lindsay and Stevie...each of these singers has a completely different vocal pattern and style, and on their own can be liked or disliked, but together they create an unmatched singular vocal tone which balances the imperfections of each voice into a perfect unity.  Stevie Nicks still provides the necessary and unique rasp and power from her voice which made Fleetwood Mac stand out from other female-vocal bands, and whether she can still achieve the ultimate top of her former vocal range is irrelevant as she still knows how to keep it perfectly in tone, range, and synch with the instrumentation and vocals of her bandmates (something today's blonde pop creations can't do even with all of today's electronic assistance). <br /> <br />And then there is Lindsay Buckingham.  A voice that on its own may not find favor with all - a fast vibrato and a high nasally tone...but in tandem with Stevie's deeper raspy resonance and Christine's soothing melodic syrup of a voice, his voice becomes a perfect match.  His songwriting for Fleetwood Mac is brilliant and poignant, and his passion and effort in his performance is inspiring and powerful.  But his guitar skill, his utter genious with the device, is beyond any description - and sends shivers down the spine and tears from the eyes of any guitar player or wannabe.  Whether his guitar skill inspires one to want to play like him one day, or forces one to sell the guitar and give up knowing you'll never even stand at the foot of the altar upon which he stands...is up to the listener.  But the acoustic performance on Big Love and Go Insane (10-finger playing in a Spanish classical style and a blues / rock rythm and pace, simultaneously laying down a complex multi-part rythm with 1/2 of each hand and playing the lead guitar with the other halves!), and the superb electric solo jam on I'm So Afraid, would merit a standing ovation even in an audience of every guitar god and virtuoso ever to play music. <br /> <br />This DVD is highly recommended, for fans and newbies alike...and a must-have for instrumentalists and other bands seeking a lesson in rock-band-musicianship 101.
B000000OQF|5.0|Next to AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\", GNR's \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" is a timeless metal masterpiece. I don't care for metal as much as I did back in high school but one of my personal favorite metal albums is GNR's eponymous debut album \\"Appetite For Destruction\\". This album represents everything that I love about rock and roll. It is anti-establishment and dangerous to those who are threatened by this type of music (i.e the PMRC). The album kicks off with a ferocious start with one of my all time favorite songs on the album \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\". The mood of the song really sets the tone for the rest of the album, meaning that thet listener is in for a serious headbanging experience. Another personal favorite song of mine is \\"Paradise City\\". Axl Rose really wails on this song. He shows that he is not someone to mess with. Just an overall great song to crank up the stereo to. Having listening to this album for the first time in a long time, I almost forgot just how much I love \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Nighttrain\\". Of course I can't forget to mention about \\"Sweet Child O' mine\\", the one song that made this band what it is. Great ballad. It is both sweet and it rocks out. I love the melodies. Addictively catchy. All the songs on the cd is awesome. The only flaw is that the production is pretty shoddy. I hope someday that \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" gets a proper remastering job like AC/DC's catalog received. Otherwise, a flawless album. It has redefined what metal is and should be.
6305897786|4.0|A very good mystery, The Ninth Gate, brings to the screen the story of a book searcher (Johnny Depp) who gets himself embroiled in the schemes of an evil and wealthy cultist who wants to summon the devil. <br />The film follows his travels from the US to Portugal and finally to France for the final showdown. <br />The plot, the setting, and the dialogues, are all very good!  <br />With slight elements of both the X-Files and the Prophecy trilogy, The Ninth Gate, is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.  It is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest of all time. It's so smart in it's stereotypes that have never been done before. The cast is perfect and had me laughing non-stop. Although the plot is thin, the laughs are what count in a comedy and this has plenty...and they're not cheap jokes...they're very clever and smart humor. Vote for Pedro!
B00005K3OT|5.0|Definitely a wonderful movie, Chocolat, brings to the screen the story of a wandering mother and daughter as they settle in a small rural post-war French village, open up a chocolaterie and begin affecting the small community/society in a most profound way.  <br />As the movie implies there is chocolate and lots of it... <br />The setting is 1959 France, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how trust, love, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.   <br />On the negative side, the only setback is the clich clash between \\"conservatism\\" and \\"progressivism\\" and how Vianne falls for the wandering gypsy. <br />Needless to say, Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Alfred Molina's character who as the town's mayor, steals the show! <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I would recommend STRONGLY for others to buy this album. It's such an impressive effort and has a lot of message behind it. I just got to know Green Day and I wish I knew them since the last decade.  <br /> <br />I love Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Letterbomb, Whatsername, and other songs too. Boulevard of Broken Dreams seems to be really popular among GD lovers. <br /> <br />It's political, but has a lot of things we can relate to... about life and stuff. <br /> <br />It's worth every cents.
0743455967|5.0|I like this short, personable non-fiction book from Stephen King.  I enjoy his writing style (as always).  Most of the anecdotes he includes in the autobiographical section you've probably read before if you're a huge fan, but they're still interesting and do include some new material.   The surprise for me in this book was Stephen King's opinions of other writers... not what I would have expected.   (Many he adores, and a few he deplores.)   <br /> <br />King writes about his accident and injuries here realistically, in contrast to the fantastical way he uses the incident in the final Dark Tower book.  (On Writing may help put things in perspective for anyone who wonders if King is channeling mid-world as the last few novels in that series have implied.  It's a comforting switch, since the world of the gunslingers has become quite a disturbing place.) <br />
B00004XONN|5.0|I bought this CD because it was first played at a record store that I frequented.  I happened to be impressed with the group's technical and sound effects.  The listener is not suppose to take it too seriously as to what they are trying to imply in their music.  It's great to listen to when you don't want to hear elevator or hype-up music.  Radiohead is talented in their own way.
B000002I27|5.0|2006 update<br /><br />Elektra has re-released all the Doors CD. They uploaded the master tapes to 24 bit/96khz (nearly SACD quality) and then remapped it back to regular CD format (16bit/44khz). The result is much more dynamic and accurate. If your copy doesn't say 24bit, throw it out and get the new ones. The biggest sonic improvement since the creation of the CD!<br /><br />*****************************************<br /><br />Rivals their self-titled album, \\"Strange Days\\" is one of the best Rock Albums of all time.<br /><br />I remember it was if it were yesterday, Merriwether Post Pavilion summer, 1968. The rest of the Doors were on stage, tuning up, Morrison was more than a half hour late. The impatient audience stomped feet and chanted. Suddenly Morrison at the back, in leather pants and snakeskin boots, no shirt, ran down the thousand steps, reached the stage and fell flat on his face. He moaned. he moaned more. Band played \\"da da da da da Dah\\". A girl yelled \\"why doesn't someone help him??? Manzarek put a mike near him so we could hear the moans louder. \\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhh\\" Suddenly he shot up ten feet in the air. \\"AHH I'm a Back Door Man!\\" and the Doors launched into the Willie Dixon blues classic.<br /><br />In '68 we thought Strange Days was their best. But the Doors got little airplay and were NOT Rock Gods in their time. Less popular than, say, \\"Canned Heat\\" or \\"Quicksilver Messenger Service\\"! Morrison and his dark Romantic, Wagernian Love-Death songs, like a 60's Baudelaire.<br /><br />This CD contains their ultimate Love-Death statement, \\"Moonlight Drive\\" which Morrison penned before there was The Doors. \\"Come on, Baby, gonna drown tonight! Goin' down, down\\". The Music Concert \\"Horse Latitudes\\" which is about Spanish Conquestadors coming to America in ships and the captains ejecting horses when the ship gets becalmed. He wrote this for English class as a junior at George Washington HS, Alexandria, VA!<br /><br />In \\"Lost Little Girl\\", Densmore and Mazarek laid down the drum and bass track, then played them back backwards before adding the vocal and guitar. \\"Love Me Two Times\\" may be their best boogie Blues song. Morrison loved the Blues and wrote more as time went on. \\"When the Music is Over\\" is a performance piece, not unlike \\"The End\\" but with ecology as the theme instead of Oedipus Rex. In '68, amid riots, LBJ and the VietNam war, we found \\"We want the World and we want it NOW\\" quite an appealing idea! Nixon hated him, put him on the Enemies List, made sure he was prosecuted. Depending on the story you believe, Morrison may well have killed himself with drugs or alcohol rather than go to prision on the trumped-up public indecency charges, after fighting the Nixon dominated courts for two years.  And sometimes \\"People are Strange\\"! The sinister paranoia of \\"Looking at the city under Television Skies\\".<br /><br />The musicianship, the precision from the whole group, the cohesion, is rarely found on any album before or since.<br /><br />Let's clear up some nonsense, Morrison had some bad habits. He drank. He was a dark visionary, a poet, a shaman and a showman with a great sense of theater. He was not a satanist. He was lived a life more like Lord Byron than Anton Levay. I'm sure he would find the rumours of satanism quite amusing, were he still with us.<br /><br />And when asked in Crawdaddy magazine, he said his \\"favorite singer was Frank Sinatra\\". We thought it was a put-on. It wasn't. Listen carefully to his singing register and phrasing.<br /><br />I have to add that I was a music critic for my college newspaper. I listened to a lot of junk, but this album and \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", received my highest rating a long time ago. Both are still all-time classics, and both have a special place in my heart.Mazarek laid down the drum and bass track, then played them back backwards before adding the vocal and guitar. \\"Love Me Two Times\\" may be their best boogie Blues song.

I listened to a lot of junk, but this album and \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", received my highest rating a long time ago. Both are still all-time classics, and both have a special place in my heart. <br /> <br />
B0000CNY27|5.0|Crime-rate in the US rises 400% in a few short years.  The US Police Force is garrisoned at Liberty Island in Manhattan harbor.  Manhattan island has been abandoned, walled up, and turned into a place where criminals are exiled.  Police helicopters with machine-guns, and a huge perimiter wall that lines the far-shore and machine-gun cops keep criminals from ever returning to society.   <br /> <br />The US has developed a doomsday nuclear weapon which will  escalate \\"Mutually Assured Destruction\\" cold-war cooling, and lead to some kind of peace.  But now, socialist revolutionaries have hijacked Airforce One (the US president's aircraft), and then crash it into the skyscrapers of Manhattan.  Just like in the 9/11 attacks, the airplane is enveloped by the skyscraper.  But, the president has an escape pod fron the aircraft that ejects at the lowest altitude, and he survives. The president was on his way to a summit to avert an imminent nuclear war. <br /> <br />The controlling criminal faction of Manhattan island seize the president and hold him hostage, in hopes of exchange for amnesty. <br /> <br />Decorated special-ops war-hero turned anarchist, Snake Pliskin has entered Liberty Island police-garrison en route to be exiled on Manhattan Island, for his crime of robbing the Federal Reserve.  And he is our only hope of getting the President, and the information on the doomsday weapon back... <br /> <br />Pliskin agrees to attempt the president's rescue, and is equipped, and then injected with what he thinks is anti-virus, only to find out he now has microscopic explosives lodged next to his jugulars with a ticking clock set to explode when the President's vital information becomes no longer useful, as the world descends into all-ought nuclear war.   <br /> <br />Snake pilots a glider into Manhattan, lands it on the World Trade Center, and begins his decent into pure hell... <br /> <br />Can you imagine what the criminals who have survived must be like in that kind of situation?   <br /> <br />The plot and dalogue are great, the acting is consistently good throughout, the action is decent, and the soundtrack (composed by the director) is killer.  <br /> <br />The director is a raging Liberal paranoid, but thanks to him we have some really great movies to watch, such as Halloween, the Fog, The Thing, and They Live. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008NRLX|5.0|I liked \\"Rainy Day Music\\" the first time I listened to it back in late spring or early summer 2003.  Since then, I have listened to it many times--and it keeps getting better.  This CD feels like a collection of lost classics from the summer of 1967, when some incredible, Byrds/Beatles/Dylan-influenced band brought all of their influences together.  The songs are all catchy, with great lyrics and strong guitars.  I don't think that there's a weak song on the CD, and some of them deserve to be classics.  The problem for me is choosing from the list!  \\"Will I See You in Heaven\\" is an obvious choice; so are \\"Stumbling Through the Dark,\\" \\"Tailspin,\\" \\"All the Right Reasons\\" . . . Oh, wait a minute:  I'm naming them all . . . <br /> <br />I'm fond of all of the Jayhawks' CDs--and of Louris' contributions to \\"Weird Tales,\\" the great Golden Smog CD.  I have a hard time preferring \\"Rainy Day Music\\" to \\"Weird Tales\\" because I bought \\"Weird Tales\\" on a whim, impressed by its funky cover art--and then discovered that I had lucked into an absolutely great CD.  Then I searched out the Jayhawks because of Louris--much to my delight.   <br /> <br />I feel that \\"Weird Tales\\" reaches some levels of intensity not present on \\"Rainy Day Music\\"--but this CD is perfect in its way.  I urge anyone who likes folk-rock to listen to the CD--and keep listening to it . . .
B00004X01U|5.0|Wow this is an amazing album - yet it only has 10 songs. When I first bought it, I only liked 1 or 2 songs, but it really grew on me, and I like all of the songs now. Even the ones I thought were very strange and un-catchy at first.
0345350472|5.0|Philip K. Dick deals with the question what is human and what defines humanity by comparing humans with humanoid robots. <br />  In the course of the novel Rick Deckard, a bounty-hunter, whose job it is to kill humanoid robots, androids, that escaped from Mars starts to cast doubt on his assignments. Are androids really unable to feel empathy? They sometimes seem to be even more human than humans. But who is human and who is not? Is the test created to find out about the real nature of the protagonists really infallible? <br />  And what about Rachel Rosen? On the one hand she occurs to be very cold and rational, but on the other hand she acts very emotional. <br />  The novel makes everbody think about life, its meening and its value in a different and new way. <br /> <br />
B00005JN2Z|3.0|There are some great things about COLLATERAL.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is phenominal in his performance. His techniques. The work he has done to look like a trained killer is fantastic. You believe he is who he says he is and you forget about the fact that he is Tom Cruise very quickly.<br /><br />The production value is fantastic. Throughout the movie, the camera lets the action do the talking. Fight scenes and shootings are done with MINIMAL to NO EDITING. You see the action go down as you would if you were standing on the streets of Los Angeles along with them.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a lot of problems with Collateral. Plotting problems. Realism problems. Acting problems.<br /><br />This movie IS BASED in REALITY. This is supposed to be REAL. This isn't a Schwarzenegger movie where otherworldly things happen, and Jamie Foxx is certainly no JOHN McCLANE (Die Hard) or JOHN RIGGS (Lethal Weapon).  So, when Jamie Foxx turns the tables on a L.A. street cop when he's about to be cuffed? Whoa. This guy is a cabbie.<br /><br />Not to mention when he goes into a den of thugs upon Vincent's (Cruise) orders and is told what to say... he manages to come up with his own words??  GOOD ONES. Even threatening to kill one of the thugs. As if... maybe... he were no stranger to the crime game. As if he maybe had a little psychotic hitman in him... it was pretty unrealistic for a guy who was inspiring to be a CHAUFFER driver for celebrities.<br /><br />At one point, there is a HIT going down in a nightclub. A Chinese mafia-type is being guarded by numerous bodyguards. So when the stuff starts going down... FIVE MINUTES LATER, this Chinese mafia-type guy is still sitting in the same place!!  Seemingly frozen in his seat. Only when the gun is finally trained on his head do his guards attempt to get him to a safe location.<br /><br />Actually, this could have been a decent movie, but honestly, about midway things really started getting hard to believe, hard to accept and DID I FORGET TO MENTION THE COINCIDENCES that lead up to the ending... that was again... disappointing and unrealistic.<br /><br />Finally, I know that Jamie Foxx is a very good actor. He proved that in RAY.  But in Collateral, I didn't like his performance. For a guy who is being held against his will, at gun point, forced to participate in murders, forced to watch murders, forced to carry bodies... he never sold me. His emotions never went far enough.<br /><br />It seemed to me... that maybe murders, dead guys in trunks and people getting shot wasn't anything new to an L.A. cab driver. If that's what they were trying to get across, then maybe the objective was achieved.<br /><br />I personally, would have liked to have seen more emotion and more desperation out of him.  Foxx was sorta bland.<br /><br />Collateral is an okay movie that could have been much better had the writers figured a better way to keep things realistic and not so cliche.to accept and DID I FORGET TO MENTION THE COINCIDENCES that lead up to the ending... that was again... disappointing and unrealistic. <br /> <br />Finally, I know that Jamie Foxx is a very good actor.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|What happens when you give a handfull of british TV comedy's brightest and most talented writer/performers enough money to make a feature film? Next factor in their mutual love of B-movie zombies? You get a brilliant horror comedy, one of the handful of films which effortlessly shift gears from clever genre parody to full fledged entries of the same genre. Not to be missed!!
1400034779|5.0|Oh, I so enjoyed this book.  I was transported to Africa and fell in love with Mme. Ramostwe immediately.  The characters stayed interesting and the cases were not predictable at all. <br />Deep issues were addressed without it being heavy or depressing. <br />Can't wait to read more in this series.
B0000DI7UR|2.0|This album is mostly a let down, but it does have a couple decent moments, but first I'd like to comment on Stratovarius' current trend of music. <br /> <br />Timo Tolkki is not a very good songwriter for the most part.  On every album Strato has done, Timo shines on about 2 or 3 songs, but the rest have become so formulatic it's laughable. (except for the mostly incredible Visions, which still dropped two turd tracks)  Besides the one or two great tracks on the CD, you get a really fast, boring chord structure, pounding headache drums, with Timo Kotipelto soaring with hardly any melody over the mess of distortion.  Of course, then Timo rips into a typical fast guitar solo.  I could stick about tons of Strato songs that fit that category, and they all sound the same. <br /> <br />No Turning Back <br />The Rebel <br />Cold Winter Nights <br />Find Your Own Voice <br />Learning To Fly <br />Know The Difference <br />I'm Still Alive <br />Speed Of Light <br />Tomorrow <br />Millenium <br />Phoenix <br />Freedom <br /> <br />And that's off the top of my head.  Timo also seems to write songs over again.  Stratosphere, Stratofortress, Stratovarius, those three are the most laughable.  Timo just throws the same crap over and over at us in EVERY album.  The ballads are a bit more melodic, but still are formulatic.  Sorry, but Timo has to step it up, because just listen to Father Time, Eagleheart, The Kiss Of Judas, and SOS.  It's like he just comes out of no where and kicks us in the ass once in a while that he is a great songwriter, but then the rest of the album blows.  C'mon Timo. <br /> <br />Onto Elements Part II.  Although it is as boring as hell, it has a bit of charm since two of the songs have a good melody to them, or it could be the album artwork.  The opening track Alpha and Omega has something about it that brings you back.  A nice little chorus that has a sting to it.  Walk To My Own song had tons of potential with a unique guitar lick at the beginnging, but something about it just made it suck.  Maybe the unharmonized vocals, or the completly blown out vocals to the stupid lyrics \\"you don't know beans.\\"  I'm Still Alive went in the big song list of mine as usual songs.  It has an almost decent chorus, but still a dumb song.  Season Of Faith's Perfection is a Strato ballad, boring and uninspired.  Awaken The Giant, Awaken The Giant, Awaken The Giant, whoopdee doo, this song is repetitive.  Know The Difference is on my list, it's terrible.  LUMINOUS!!  This song is GREAT, melodic and soft.  Very touching, undeniably the best written song on the album.  Dreamweaver, Dreamweaver, whoopdee doo, boring.  Liberty, kind of good, but Kotipelto sounds like a clown on it.   <br /> <br />This album is boring.  Very boring.  As is Stratovarius.  Timo has tons of potential to write a full album of great songs, let's see it.  Don't get this one unless you are a completist.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|This movie is a sweet and sometimes touching holiday treat for the whole family with a touch of hilarity and a little sadness it could be added to any holiday collection. <br /> <br />Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's (Ed Asner) bag as a baby and is eventually adopted by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). Buddy grows up making toys for Santa but never quite gets up to the speed of the other elves and after trying a few odd jobs at the Pole he overhears the fact that he is really a human being and not an elf. This sets Buddy off on a search for his real human father in New York City. Buddy does his best to snuggle up to his father Walter (James Caan) and his step-mother Emily (Mary Steenburgen) while having a hard time dealing with all of the harsh chaos of human life.  <br /> <br />This film is a sweet portrayal of a human being brought up among elves in the faultlessness of Santa's home. It takes an innocent, positive person and places them right in the middle of all the negative human behaviors that seem to be magnified during the happiest of holidays. It places a smile back on the faces of anyone who lost the magic of Christmas and the joy of Santa Claus. And it definitely makes you look at your own attitude towards the people you \\"love\\" and care about while sadly showing all of the lost virtue of humanity. With Will Ferrell cast as the childlike elf it never ceases to be funny but some of the gags are a little far stretched...especially the burping scene! James Caan is great as the shut down, stressed-out and angry father. And who could forget Ed Asner as Santa! Overall a great message stems from this Christmas movie and you might even find yourself hoping for one last meeting with Santa Claus before your heart freezes over for good.  <br />
B00009TB5G|1.0|I was dragged to the theater to see \\"The Fellowship\\" three years ago and I thought it was a long, boring, buttburner of a sword and sorcery tale and regretted having allowed myself to be taken there.  The \\"story\\" (so-called) was thin and difficult to find.  This second film in a trilogy is even worse.  It drags on and on, ad infinitum.  I do not care how many hottie elves (and they were cute, mind you) or snazzy special effects you throw in, if you do not have a story, you do not have anything. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the New Zealand scenery is gorgeous and the cinematography is to die for.  What a shame it is wasted on such a lame story line. <br /> <br />I am usually a fan of the fantasy and scifi genre.  I even found something to love in the \\"Dune\\" series, but this overblown rendition of Tolkein was simply too much. <br /> <br />Please take my advice and don't waste your money, no matter what you have heard.  Hey, rent John Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" or something if you want an intelligent sword and sorcery tale.  Just leave this whole trilogy at the video store.  It is strictly for the under-13 mallrat set.
6305841861|5.0|In truth, EVIL DEAD II (a.k.a., EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN) is essentially a bigger-budget remake of its infamous predecessor.  Once again, readings from the Sumerian BOOK OF THE DEAD release demons that rove the forest, bring life to inanimate objects, and possess humans (both corpses and warm bodies alike).  And as with the original, plot and setting have been pared to a minimum--almost all the action takes place within a cramped rural cabin as a small of group of mostly throwaway characters battles one grotesquerie after another.  Formulaic, yes, but it's a formula that works for auteur Sam Raimi. His comic-book style and the outrageous special FX combine into a hilarious Freudian nightmare that is essential viewing for true genre fans.  (Also a notable ingredient in this garish cinematic concoction is the over-the-top acting style of Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as antihero Ash.)  In technical terms, it's slicker than the first, but not necessarily better.<br /><br />The MPAA wanted to slap an \\"X\\" rating on the film due to the gore and graphic violence, but  the filmmakers decided to release it unrated.  To any reasonable viewer, the gore and violence are so blatantly exaggerated and removed from reality that all genuine emotional content is removed, and this in turn heightens the film's funeral-parlor humor.<br /><br />Several DVD versions of EVIL DEAD II are out there, but the best ones--usually from Anchor Bay--include filmmaker commentary and other extras.  A must for any serious horror collection.
B000024D4R|4.0|I knew from the start that the lyrics would be interesting to listen to and I was right. All lyric are sung about animals but they aren't really about animals at all. There are about different kinds of people (read editorial review). It's a great cd as every Pink Floyd cd is and will make your PF collection look even better. <br /> <br />1. Pigs On The Wing- (1:25)-10/10-- Well first off this cd starts with this short song, which is a cool acoustic introduction. It kind of made me feel like Roger Waters was going to be singing like he did in \\"The Wall\\" and that made me feel better about the cd. It's not really a song to listen to over and over again because of how short it is though but gives a nice introduction to what the cd is about. <br /> <br />2. Dogs- (17:08)-10/10--Starts off quickly with Roger singing but features more guitar solos then singing. That's great considering Gilmour is one of the best guitarists. Keyboard really kicks in about 11 minutes into the song but not for long before guitar takes over, then keyboard, then guitar, and then keyboard. Its actually kind a cool. Not long after, Roger starts singing and then awesome guitar solos take over and drums come in and cool keyboard sounds are played.  This makes the song way better. The best guitar solos are on this song. <br /> <br />3. Pigs (Three Different Ones)- (11:28)-10/10-Has a cool introduction with keyboard and pigs snorting. It kind of makes you laugh at first. The guitar for this one is good but not as great as what was featured in \\"Dogs\\". The lyrics are what makes this song great, and are the best on the cd. Though there are only about 4 minutes of singing in the whole track. The keyboard is awesome as well.   <br /> <br />4. Sheep- (10:20)-8/10--Starts off slow with keyboard, and then picks up with guitar, singing, and the drums. Drumming and guitar stay steady for the whole song except for solo parts. It has some cool guitar solos throughout the song but not many. This song is also featured on the greatest hits cd but isn't the best on this cd. It's still a good song though.  <br /> <br />5. Pigs On The Wing Part 2- (1:25)-9/10--Same length, and same title as the first track. I think I liked the first one better but this is still a good ending for the cd.  <br /> <br />OVERALL- A great cd from a great band but wish there would have been more/shorter songs with more guitar solos throughout each song. Not good for a first PF album. For a first get \\"The Wall\\", or \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". <br />
B000000H64|5.0|Yes people the doors opened up for Fear Factory in 1995 when this masterclass of a record began it's debut, 'Demanufacture' is one of the most life-changing, original, brutaly mastered albums your ever likely to hear in your entire life! Believe me, it's THAT good! This is hailed as a Industrial metal classic, because it broke all the boundaries and stood as the test of time that even bands before FF such as Ministry, Godflesh and the like wouldn't dare touch!    Not only that but if you look into the lyrics deeply you'll notice that some songs could cause controversy (especially 'Pisschrist'). Or a life gone bad caused by Political views such as the lyrics on album-titled opener \\"Desensitized by the values of life/Maligned and despaired by Government lies\\".  'Replica' is a fine example of that too, as Burton sings \\"Spare me from the life that's full of misery/I don't want to live that way!\\".  'Demanufacture' also has it's own sound too, yep, you will not find another album like this anywhere else, it's in a league of its own! Raymond's drumming is impeccable and tight! Dino's riffs are out of this world, Christian (his first album with the band) knows how to play a bass! But it's Burton C. Bell's vocals that clinch the real deal here!   Want the best album of 1995? Then get this!
B000002KKS|5.0|This CD just rocks from start to finish. All the songs are well put together. I think this CD sounds like a Dio album even before he went on his own. His presence consumes the music, the music doesn't even sound like Black Sabbath with Ozzy, it sounds like Dio. \\"Heaven and hell\\" is a truely classic, timeless hard rock song both lyrically and musically. This is a no skipping tracks CD, it plays through beautifully which earns it 5 stars in my book.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I won't say what other's have said because it ain't worth it, everyone knows these guys listened to a few too many Alice In Chains songs and even stole one of their song names! But I've given this album SO many chances, but man, I just can't get used to it! I know I'll probably get a bad rap for my review from enraged Godsmack fans, but hey I have my opinion too! <br />It seems nu-metal never seems to offer anything much anymore...
630512762X|5.0|I absoloutely love it!!! Although I'm not a fan of action-movies, \\"Face/Off\\" is on the top of my \\"favourite-movie-list\\"!!! Everything about this movie is perfect: The plot, the action, the actors... <br /> <br />And John Travolta looks so sexy(and muscular)in these suits he wears..(Btw, he acts brilliant in BOTH parts, also Nicolas Cage) <br />Adorable! <br />Lilly
B000092Q4U|5.0|'As The Palaces Burn' Lamb Of God's second accomplishment seems to be tied in between with their latest album and 'New American...' and I just can't seem to figure out which album I love the most. <br />To this day I'm still not sure, but for now, and to keep this short 'n sweet I'll say this is their best work!  <br /> <br />Best tracks: 'Ruin', 'A Devil In God's Country', 'For Your Malice', & 'Blood Junkie'.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Having been a fan of the Superman comic books in my younger years, I thought this movie was fantastic when it came out in 1978. It was the most realistic depiction of Superman that I had ever seen -- and this before the days of digital special effects.    On DVD it is even better. The picture quality is superb. (For example, they were able to correct digitally some scenes where the costume had to be slightly green because of filming against a blue screen.) The soundtrack has been remastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital -- what a difference from the washed-out sound of my old VHS tape. Plus, the DVD is packed with extras, many of which are quite good.    I wish Superman II had gotten the same treatment. It's okay on DVD, but did not get upgraded like \\"The Movie.\\"    Update: Dec. 2010: The Blu-Ray edition adds just enough clarity to make it worth the purchase. But the audio is still DD 5.1 -- it was not upgraded to True HD.
B00004Y7SF|3.0|It's obvious that Christina Aguilera is an amazing and gifted singer with a voice light years ahead of non-singer Britney Spears.  My only problem is that she oversings so much it turns my stomach.  One syllable words should be one syllable, not thirty-seven notes up and down the scale.  When she sang \\"I Turn To You\\", she did a magnificent job of showcasing her voice without oversinging.  She should return to this style of vocal phrasing, not resorting to vocal gymnastics on every song.  She has an amazing voice and is a very gifted singer.  It's no wonder why she won the Grammy for best new artist the same year she was up against you know who.
140004281X|5.0|I have not read Munro before, so this was a revelation and reaffirmation.  One sometimes loses track of good writing in the plethora of books that we read and forget about.  I had not read past the first page when I realized that this is the work of a master, a deliberate work of art.  The reader is captured by the style and what happens in the stories is not as important as how those happenings are revealed.  Then we realize we are reading about ourselves.  This is a participatory book in which the reader discovers self in the ordinary experiences of the characters--the fall of a leaf from a tree or a sound in the darkness of a summer night.  We are all products of accidental events, and wisdom is elusive as the wind.
0385508417|1.0|Sniff, sniff. Somethin' stinks. What could it be? You know, when you're walking down the sidewalk on a crisp Winter's night, with a fresh snow all around, enjoying all the beautiful decorations, and suddenly splat. Something wet and sticky under your shoe. Somebody's dog has been out.<br /><br />Well, that's what this book amounts to. Sniff, sniff.<br /><br />Annoying characters. Extreme cheese with a worse stench. Once the daughter called home, I wrapped it up in a plastic bag and threw it in the trash. Couldn't stand the smell.
B00064AM6C|5.0|Of course I wasn't at the concert when this filmed and I've only been a fan for about a year,but I started getting into them when I saw them on Conan.I bought this dvd when it came out and I wasn't disappointed at all!!

0743244257|1.0|Delillo seems to think his \\"observations\\" are novel and deep. In truth, Delillo's \\"observations\\" in this little novella are phony, pretentious, inane, immature, misguided, blase, uninspired, and downright imbecilic at times.  <br /> <br />I'd offer some quotations to back this up but this book already found it's rightful place (before it could be finished): the trash can of a train station.
B000088E6D|1.0|I personally think that you are wasting your time and money if you but this album. The fact that this artist has not written a single word or note by himself tells me that he is all looks and no talent. If I wanted to hear a high quality remake of a 50's or 60's songs I'd rather listen to Harry Connick Jr.  <br /> <br />Michael is a hack and dosn't deserve to be singing Bentit, Sanatra, or any other artists songs. Mike if you remake a song then make it better...not worse. I'd rather listen to Steve wonder then to this crap.... At least he's a real musician in every sence of the word.
B00029LNHS|5.0|[...]    Fun, quick, and believe it or not, Black Eyed Peas still manage to get a good message out.  Their older, hard stuff, was more substance than style which at times can be hard to relax and listen to.  But these guys pulled off a great balance here.    Plenty for tiny boppers to enjoy.  Yes, EXPRESSIVE lyrics, I like to say, probalby not suitable for some children.     But then again, very little -mainstream- pop music these days are suitable for children.  So hate on something else if you don't like these guys.    Thanks!  B.A.R.  [...]
B000062Y44|5.0|BDB is incredible.  He shows his talent and versatility in this album, which is SO much more than your typical soundtrack.  If you've seen the movie, you will realize how much his songs reflect the mood and plot.  However, even if you haven't, it stands alone as a wonderful album.  Kudos to one of the ONLY original artists on the music scene today!
B00000C2Y4|1.0|When I was in high school, this album was considered a \\"masterpiece\\" by many of my peers.  I never got it then, and I don't get it now. All this hype about \\"virtuosity\\" and \\"instrumental brilliance\\" can't hide the fact that this music has no soul, no passion. It us utterly unlistenable. Bad techno rock.  Yuck. <br /> <br />
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sorry, but they are.  If you didn't like this movie, you weren't intelligent enough to understand it.  For those of you who want to see a beautiful, moving, incredibly powerful film, see this one.  It's truest beauty is in it's simplicity.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD should come with a warning label. It's that addicting. One listen leads to another and another after that and... You get the point.  <br /> <br />I have been a fan of musicals since I was little, so I was excited when I heard that the book \\"Wicked\\" (which I have read and enjoyed) was being turned into one. While I haven't had the privilege of actually seeing the play, the soundtrack has become a fixture in my CD player. <br /> <br />When I got the soundtrack, I noticed that it was missing a summary of the musical, so, I went online and found one to help me fill in the gaps between the songs. Doing this really helped me appreciate the songs a lot more. Without the knowledge of what's going on, the soundtrack can sound a little random and confusing. <br /> <br />When you know the story behind the songs, each listen feels like an emotional roller coaster. During the first half of the CD, you travel from the morbidly celebratory \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" to the hopeful \\"The Wizard and I\\" to the perkily humorous \\"Popular\\" to the wonderfully uplifting \\"Defying Gravity.\\" From there, you find the wistful \\"Thank Goodness,\\" the satirical \\"Wonderful,\\" the wicked (I couldn't resist..) \\"No Good Deed,\\" and the heartbreaking \\"For Good.\\"  <br /> <br />The songs mentioned above are the highlights for me, but the other songs are also likeable or, at least, serve a purporse. \\"Dear Old Shiz\\" sounds like the most pointless song on the CD, but it's a good transition between scenes. \\"What Is This Feeling?\\" provides more than a few chuckles and is a good showcase for all involved. \\"Something Bad\\" helps to push the plot along in a painless way. \\"Dancing Through Life\\" gives the minor characters their chance to shine. \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and its reprise allow the leading ladies to sing delicate, understated ballads. \\"One Short Day\\" is an upbeat, if somewhat generic song. \\"A Sentimental Man\\" is one of the shorter songs on the CD and, in my opinion, should have been longer. \\"As Long AsYou're Mine\\" steps up as the requisite love ballad. It's sweet, but one of the blander songs on the soundtrack. \\"March of the Witch Hunters\\" is a good, mob song that helps drive the story to its conclusion. Finally, the \\"Finale\\" serves the purpose of wrapping everything up in a way that will leave you with a lump in your throat. <br />      <br />
B0000CFW87|4.0|Songs I liked on this album were \\"Si Volvieras a Mi\\",\\"All'improvviso Amore\\", \\"You Raise Me Up\\". In some of his songs, he sings too softly which is annoyingly contrasting with the powerful voice of \\"You Raise Me Up\\". But overall, this guy has talent.
B00005JLEX|5.0|he thinks seinfeld is lame but spiderman is the best? come back kid when you get pubes and start understanding life a little...it ain't about spiderman i can tell you that much...seinfeld captures every awkward type accident that we have ever encountered before and makes us realize how silly the little things are that annoy us ...I have posted reviews for dvd's before and amazon rejected them, although I felt they were entirely appropriate, so how this little punk kid gets not one, but two lousy reviews in that aren't even reviews is beyond me...I don't know, maybe he's related to someone on the amazon staff...anyway, I reported it as inappropriate...so whether you'll ever see MY review will see the light of day remains to be seen...this is one of the best shows that has ever graced the tv screen, and now it has finally been given the royal treatment and released on season sets...i applaud the folks responsible for their efforts and if you are a fan, you should not hesitate in purchasing every season set
055357342X|5.0|I can't believe I'm admitting this in print, but here goes: I started this series beacuse of Jordan's by-line on the cover of the first book.  Whew!  Glad I got that off my chest. <br /> <br />I'm in complete agreement with the majority on this one: Martin is a SUPERLATIVE author, and quite possibly the best author in this genre alive at this point.  His characters are VERY fully-fleshed, without being archetypes; as great as those characters are, and as much as you love them, don't get attached - they're PROBABLY going to die (eventually). <br /> <br />In the effort of not belaboring the point, I'll give the main reason I love this guy: all the characters are shades of grey - you can't tell who's going to react how, when. <br /> <br />For those of you who haven't heard this yet - he did the bulk of his work screenwriting for the past many years;  hence the reason it may FEEL like a soap opera =). <br /> <br />GRRM.  Read him.  Love him.  Never look back.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|The plot: Giant conspiracy to create a half werewolf half vampire crossbreed forces kate beckingsdale to don skin tight leather and kick some serious werewolf ass.  Lot's of guns, special effects and blood drinking.   <br /> <br />Who should buy this movie: People who like vampire movies, Van Helsing, Tomb Raider, or any of the Soul Reaver games.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|After reading all the amazing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I just had to get this album.  It took a few listens, and I'm officially hooked.  This music has the ability to penetrate you.  The music arrangements are so moving, I find it hard not to feel the music.  Even though the album is called Funeral, and covers sad material, it is inspirational.
068987474X|4.0|I found this book to be a very entertaining read. However, I found it only really scratched the surface on the problems that both men and women face on a daily basis. I think the authors over simplified the subject matter. They seem to portray the issues we face as black and white. If only it could be that simple. In fact I wouldn't be in the loving relationship I am today if I followed the advice presented in this book. My man had a lot of challenges from his youth and it took him a long time to come to terms with some of life's issues. If I would have followed the suggestions in this book, I would have not given him the opportunity to discover who he really is. <br />The book seems to miss the fact that we all have insecurities that affect us. Non of us are perfect. Telling all women that they deserve better is a great way to sell books. However, the statement assumes all women are great. The fact is, all women are not great and do not deserve better. In reality life is more than an episode of a TV series. I found this book to be great for ratings (book sales) and sometimes fun, but it did not leave me wanting more. If you want a fun read, I definitely recommend this book. If you want to look at relationships and life from a different perspective, I recommend Seed's Sketchy Relationship Theories - A Guide to the Perils of Dating (How not to become a bar regular). A little gem I accidentally stumbled across.
014028009X|4.0|I ordered this book along time ago and have been reading bits and peices of it here and there..Its a nice little fluff read..Kinda like peeking in your naughty sisters Diary! I thought the movie was cute,But the book is so much Cuter and Bridget is a bit brighter than they make her out to be on Screen.Its really a fun fun book.I'm glad I read it and would recommend it for fans of the movie or those just looking for a nice easy read!
068987474X|4.0|Thank you Liz and Greg! Your book was recommended to me by a girlfriend and I must say it has opened my eyes. It is refreshing to find others who have the same problems as me. I will no longer waste my time with guys who can't seem to decide what they want. Very empowering!<br />I also recommend Seed's Sketchy Relationship Theories - A Guide to the Perils of Dating (How not to become a bar regular) and What Men Want, both entertaining and eye opening reads.
0446608955|5.0|This was one of the most amazing books i have ever read. I don't think i ever gotten that emotionnaly involved in a story before. At the beggining of the story, Nicholas Sparks described the town in which the story takes place, I could picture it perfectely in my mind. This story was wonderfully written and was told through the eyes of the main character Landon Carter. <br /> <br />       I remember at so many points in this book, how i laughed and i was smiling at the beggining, when Landon was calling girl after girl desperatly searching for a date. And then how that quickly turned into tears. It was a beautiful story about young love and true love. I'll never forget this story, ever.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne does not write songs. She writes lyrics. Other people  write the music. Avril Lavigne whines constantly that she is not given recognition for her abilities on guitar, yet does not play guitar even once on this record. All Avril Lavigne has to do is show up at the studio with terrible, monosybillic poetry of the junior-high variety, and she goes triple-platinum. With all of this in mind, it's hard to figure out what has to be angry about. Nearly every song here is a faux-grunge dirge, polished and compressed, ready-made for the shopping mall. Avril Lavigne was kind of cute and funny when she released her first album; her tremendous attitude and lack of any musical talent, though, have rendered her irrelevant.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is Freakin' Awsome. It has basically no plot but that is the cool part you dont notice it because the movie is freakin' hilarious.Gosh!
0142001104|5.0|I've read a lot of self-help inspirational books. This book sometimes reminds me of \\"Who moved my cheese?\\" by Spencer Johnson and Kenneth H. Blanchard or even \\"7 spiritual laws of success\\" by Deepak Chopra. But this book is different. \\"The Art of Possibility\\" does not offer a quick path to wealth. The authors show us that inspiration does come from every-day events. The book invites you to see life from a different perspective, if you wish so. This book is certainly a great start to freeing up one's brain and thinking process. I highly recommend \\"The Art of Possibility\\" to anybody seriously seeking to release their full potential from the control of our human conditioning. This is really a wise book about transforming yourself and others.  <br />
B000021XR5|5.0|No. 4 didn't strike me initially as \\"great\\", but I did immediately latch on to certain songs such as the early singles, \\"Down\\" and \\"Sour Girl\\". Over time, the album became completely listenable from front to back and has a nice cohesiveness and continuity that has always been a hallmark of STP albums. This is likely due to the constant collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien throughout their entire recording career as a band. He was well documented as a 5th member of STP - much like he was the 6th for Pearl Jam for many years. <br /> <br />Ultimately this album doesn't provide the same kind of radio hooks that albums like Core and Purple did, but what it may lack in commercial appeal, it makes up for in solid songwriting and great riffs. To me, No. 4 is much akin to Pearl Jam's Vitology - underappreciated and often overlooked.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|This is NOT made up of traditional Christmas material. It is made up of songs perfomed the way that Christina Aguilera likes the songs, and though the album is not perfect it is not bad at all.    One this album there are some classic songs and a couple new ones. The classic songs are not sung in the traditional manner, Christina puts little twists and adjusts the vocals to personalise the songs to fit her style of singing. The best classic songs performed here are; Merry Christmas Baby, Have yourself a Merry little Christmas, This Christmas,  These are the Special Times and The Christmas Song. These are sung mostly traditionally with little bits added on , like an extended vocal etc..    Then there are the other tracks like Christmas Time and This Year, that she sings that aren't familiar by are also good.    Hark the Hearald Angels Sing and Silent Night are the two that  like the least. Hark takes on a whole new sound that doesn't fit with me really and Silent Night is beautiful except towards the end where it turns into a church choir sound.    Though this album has its faults it should be enjoyable to many durng this festive time of year. It is not doubted that Christina has immense talent , however on some of the tracks here she tends to over vocalise a bit. Neverthe less an enjoyable album by a talented young woman.
B0006284JQ|1.0|there should be a way to do that. I have a better voice than Britney Spears. While I'm on the subject, I have a better voice than Ashlee Simpson and that Lindsay Lohan too. But I digress-this woman's success is grossly out of proportion to her talent. Her voice is annoying and nasal. Yeah, she has a nice body, but so do many other people. Now, Beyonce-she can sing. That woman from Mazzy Star can sing. Tori Amos. Joan Armatrading. There's a long list of good musicians worthy of your ear. You don't have to buy this crap. Just say \\"no.\\" <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|This is a great album, a must have for even casual U2 fans.  The first time I listened to it, I liked it, but didn't think it was better than their previous release, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\"  After listening to it through one more time, I became absolutely enchanted, and \\"How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\\" has been the only CD played in my car since I bought it on November 23rd.  Every song on it is great, the lyrics are incredible, and its style could best be described as \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" meets \\"Zooropa\\":  the emotional anguish in Bono's voice that we've all come to know and love mixed with The Edge letting loose.  In my estimation, this is U2's best album yet, with \\"The Joshua Tree\\" as a close second.
B00005JKOI|1.0|I grew up in the 1980s and I didn't know about Molly Ringwald until just recently. So I went and got 'Pretty in Pink' and, let me tell you, it was pretty lame. Molly plays a nobody named Andie who dresses up in old lady clothes. Her mother walked out on her and her father three years ago, so Andie has decided to change her role from being a daughter to a substitute wife. Her dad is a loser who's too lazy to get a job and every morning Andie wakes him, serves him breakfast, and nags about him having to find a job. Anyway, she has this screwed up friend name \\"Ducky\\" who is more annoying than funny and is in love with Andie. But Andie is in love with this rich guy at school named Blayne who isn't even hot. Basically, the movie is about poor Andie in love with rich Blayne. The acting was okay, but the story was boring and unbelievable. Molly's wardrobe was horrendous and that prom dress she wore at the end should have been ripped off of her and burned. It was *that* awful.
B0000024ZT|5.0|GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK, NJ is a great debut from Bruce Springsteen, who, ironically, only got better as he got more successful. My first copy of this cassette was a crummy-sounding Columbia House edition where some of the vocals sounded like they were emanating from a creature of the occult. Recently, however, I did some rehab exercises to a real Columbia cassette version, and boy, what a difference! The backup vocals actually sounded human, not demon-like, and the instruments could be heard much better individually. The first side was great, with several songs ramblig right into each other, and side two contains some songs that are more straightforward, including \\"Spirit In The Night\\" and \\"For You.\\" The aforementioned first side contains such gems as \\"Blinded By The Light\\", \\"Growin' Up\\", \\"It's So Hard To Be A Saint In The City\\", and the antiwar protest song \\"Lost In The Flood\\", which could also be about someone losing their tolerance for anyone who doesn't fit \\"a perfect little mold.\\" Springsteen  improved on even this great debut with the follow-up, and then lept forward with BORN TO RUN, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, and THE RIVER, all of which are equally great, and while NEBRASKA wasn't quite as good, he nearly equalled his breakthrough albums with BORN IN THE USA, TUNNEL OF LOVE, HUMAN TOUCH, and LUCKY TOWN, before equalling the 1975-80 albums with 18 TRACKS, LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY and THE RISING. Surprisingly, this album was a commercial failure upon release, although it did chart later, after Springsteen's career took off.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I had heard the name Frankie Valli and of the group the Four Seasons but I never knew what songs Frankie Valli or the Four Seasons had done. Nor did I know that Frankie Valli was even in the group the Four Seasons! I thought the Four Seasons was just another one of those corny, one-hit wonder, old timey groups of the 50s and 60s that just, quite frankly, didn't have any soul.  So for me to like anything remotely Frankie Valli or the Four Seasons is rather uncanny.  But PBS had a special on music of the 70's in particular Disco music, and since there was nothing edifying on TV, I decided to watch and get a couple of laughs. Not long after watching, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons were introduced, and I'm thinking what are Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons doing on this show-this is a show about disco music--not 50's and 60's oldies music--even though the guys that were performing with Frankie Valli as the \\"Four Seasons\\" looked to have been more around my age--singing about 1963 and looking to have been born in 1973 or later. And so, because I didn't know any better, I thought, oh, someone in 70's must have remade one of their old songs from the 50's or 60's into a disco hit and they simply came to perform it, not knowing that they indeed had some disco hits in the 70's. So I watched this cute little old guy come on stage, and he was dancing--well moving--and able to keep up with those young guys, and he actually had SOME soul, so much so, that, well, I was converted. Suffice to say, I fell in love with Frankie Valli, and it propelled me to learn more about the songs the group did, including Frankie Valli's solo projects, and the group's history. As I listen to these old songs I am finding that not only did Frankie Valli have a soulful voice, but the songs actually HAD rhythm! And what can I say--now I'm hooked.     It's unfortunate that my generation (gen-xers) don't really know or aren't familiar with these artists of the past. Sure we sample their music, andremake their songs, but we don't give them any props. Many have had such a profound influence on popular music, and yet they remain relatively forgotten. VH1 used to have shows like Behind the Music and Legends--which was short-lived--that showcased groups and artists of the 50's, 60's and 70's but lately I don't see shows like Legends anymore, which again, is unfortunate.     It's ironic that one editor called their disco stint as misguided--for had it not been for those disco songs I would have never had that chance encounter with Frankie Valli and never would have known that this group was responsible for so many of the classics that have been remade or heard in movies or even in television advertisements.      This is a great CD. And it has the essentials--so whether you've been a Frankie Valli and Four Seasons fan for years or you're a neophyte like me, newly discovering and appreciating this group--you won't be disappointed. And while I still loathe most goldies oldies (or whatever it's called).  I make an exception for the Four Seasons. Who knew they had soul!

B0001ZMWQO|1.0|...and these guys are the coolest band around.  I love listening to art-house bands like this and pretending to be smart right along with them.  Their faux-art music videos and angular guitar work allow me the freedom to make my friends think I'm smarter than them...too bad they won't hang out with me anymore because they're at least smart enough to realize how boring Franz Ferdinand is.  In addition to being derivative of any number of post-punk bands, they even had the foresight to rip a riff straight from Led Zeppelin's \\"Trampled Under Hoof.\\"
B00005JMXX|2.0|Just overused computer effects that are great exagerated.  I seen when it first came out.  Wish I had waited till it came to the $1 theatre showing.

B000001FRY|5.0|Ahhh, this is the great raw, young energetic U2. You can picture them in the studio, running around, full of beans. <br />Tearing the microphone, screaming notes from the guitar and smashing the drums with fury! <br />This is great music, and far better than the last 13 or 14 years of their career. <br />This is U2 music that many know and love, with great guitar, solid lyrics and great melodies. <br />Essential for your U2 collection.  <br />This U2 how they should sound in my humble opinion!!! <br />A great album!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|There was glut of live albums released in the late seventies, thanks, in no small part, to the hideous multi-platinum \\"Framptom Comes Alive\\".  Most of those live albums were forgettable, but \\"Strangers in the Night\\" in one of the greatest live albums of the era. This recording captures a young hot UFO at its performing peak.<br /><br />At the time UFO was opening for BOC, and they played that familiar late seventies blues influenced metal.  In many ways this album represents an evolutionary link between 70's blues metal and 80's hair metal.<br /><br />I appreciate the remastering and reshuffling of the song order to reflect the true set list.  And this is the perfect opening act show, it starts out strong, then kicks it down a notch, before building to the final four songs in a gushing guitargasm.<br /><br />Guys got this album for the guitar solos, and Michael Schenker puts on a clinic here.  His shredding brightens up even the most cliched rock riffing.  \\"Lights Out\\" is my favorite tune of this set.  Not too many songs end on a guitar solo, and the one at the conclusion of \\"Lights Out\\" ranks up there with the best.
B00000099Y|5.0|I asked my friend for a copy of this album and i'm very glad i did.  I have been hooked on this album since i got it.  I listen to it everyday at leat once.  At times this album gets muddy and can almost get boring, but right when you're about to change the song, BAM!! it gets good. <br />My favorited track is Eulogy, which is my favorite Tool song of all time.  Stinkfist, H., Fortysix&2, Hooker with a penis, Push it and Aenima are all great tracks.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Two men are about to cross paths unknowing of what consequences they will have upon each other.  Max (Jamie Foxx) is dreamer that has worked as a cab driver for 12 years while awaiting the moment when he has enough capital to invest in a Limousine company that will offer the ultimate ride for its passengers.  When fares begin to converse with Max he often brings up his vision of the Limo company, and one evening at the airport he meets a stunningly beautiful lawyer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith).  On their way to Annie's destination they begin to chat about music, her job, and his dreams, which eventually leads to Annie offering him her card as a token that she wants to see him again.<br /><br />Bewildered in his thoughts Max remains seated in the cab after Annie has left when a new fare asks if the cab is taken, which breaks the spell on him.  The passenger in due time reveals his name as Vincent (Tom Cruise) while he probes Max of who he is, and then he tells Max that he has five stops to make and he can make $600 if he stays with him.  Hesitant Max considers the offer, however, Vincent appears as a tough negotiator as he pushes the money into his hand while telling that these offers do not happen often.  Max takes the money and parks in the alley where he begins to eat his supper while thumbing a Mercedes brochure.  However, this is the peaceful moment before the storm that is about to enter Max's life and turn it upside down.<br /><br />Vincent has a cynical outlook on life that is heavily influenced by Darwinistic thinking and possibly Nietzsche as he believes that man has to seize the day, or the man might perish.  The moment of existence is now, not later, if one waits one misses an opportunity to make the most of the current situation.  This is what Vincent's life philosophy boils down to as he brings Max on an existential journey.  The two venture to a jazz club where Vincent and Max sit down and listen to the spontaneous jamming by the band on the stage.  Vincent wonders if Max can hear the sudden surprise that lays within the music, but Max is too preoccupied with his internal fear to give the music any thought.  At the end of the evening at the jazz club the cab driver and the passenger talk with Daniel, the owner and a musician, who recollects the moment when Miles Davis entered the club and how he missed his opportunity as a musician.<br /><br />When Max and Vincent are between destinations Max receives a message over the radio that his mother is anxiously wondering about his whereabouts, as she is hospitalized and he visits her every evening.  Slightly amused over the situation Vincent looks at his watch and says that they have time for a quick stop.  When they enter the hospital Vincent reminds Max that his mother carried him in her uterus for nine months, and he must bring her flowers for which Vincent pays.  When they arrive to the room where Max's mother rests she continuously criticizes him while speaking softly and kindly to Vincent, which appears to be very difficult for Max.  It is evident to Vincent that Max never attempts to take the step from dream to reality, as Max seems to be preoccupied by insecurities and fears of failure, which seems rooted in Max's relationship to his mother.<br /><br />In Seventh Seal (1957) Ingmar Bergman offers some insights to our existence as Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) plays a prolonged chess match with the Grim Reaper.  Collateral works in a similar manner as Seventh Seal.  Max is the guide to the destinations, as Block did in Seventh Seal, while Vincent is the person that follows much like the Grim Reaper.  Maybe it is far fetched to say that Collateral compares to the masterpiece Seventh Seal, however, the similarities are there in regards to existentialism.  The question is whether Max will learn anything from Vincent while visiting the five different destinations.<br /><br />Michael Mann's Collateral is a solid cinematic experience that depicts serious philosophy through an action packed thriller.  The cast's performances provide genuine feel for who characters are, maybe the scene when Max pretends to be Vincent as he talks to Felix (Javier Bardem) is a little over the top, but it turns out to be one of those cool scenes where no one can get hurt.  The long opening before Max meets Vincent displays Mann's cunningness in direction as this provides a strong foundation that develops strong characters, which is needed for this story.  However, Mann does not reach the same level with Collateral as he did with Heat (1995) and The Insider (1999), yet he touches something deeper with this film as he dwells on existentialism and carpe diem.osophy through an action packed thriller.

B00012QM8G|5.0|I am sure if survivors of WW II seen this movie, it would be like reliving it over again.  Even in black & white the movie was very realistic and true.  The partial color portion of the movie helped add the effect and told you a little something about Mr. Schiendler himself and how good of a man he was.
B000001F3C|5.0|One of the great albums to come out last century, this is totally awesome music frpm the famous band. <br />Perhaps U2 will leave a huge legacy of disappointed fans, who wondered what happenned to the band after \\" The Joshua Tree\\" who knows? <br />Perhaps it's because their first five albums were just so good. <br />Could it only be downhill after such classics as these? <br />Their musical direction changes may have pleased some, but those who longs for the early stuff will have to keep going back to classic stuff such as \\" Boy\\" & \\" The Unforgettable Fire\\" <br />They aren't the same these days, they have changed forever. <br />At least this moment in their career was captured so brilliantly! <br />Music the way it was meant to be played
0553573403|5.0|An incredible fantasy/adventure.<br /><br />I've been a fantasy reader for years now and thought I'd about run the gambit of available books/authors to read. I'd just recently finish Steven Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\"(5 books) and Scott Bakker's \\"Prince of Nothing\\" (2 Books) and felt that these efforts were about as good epic fantasy as I've ever come across. That is, until I found this book in the \\"Fire and Ice\\" series; this book by G.R.R. Martin is, I think, one the best I've ever read in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Why?... let me elaborate.<br /><br />We've all heard a great story teller whose voice kind of mesmerizes you and you become completely absorbed in what is being spoken. Well, this story has the same effect but with the written word instead of the spoken.<br /><br />The story is huge in scope and breadth but yet it does not ramble on with endless fill. Each chapter, even each paragraph, seems to bring some point of interest  that adds to the aura of the story being presented. It is simply readable in the purest sense: you want to get back to this book; you look for time to have to yourself to get \\"a get a few more pages in\\". It's that good!<br /><br />The characters seem real, believable: some you love and others you love to hate. There is travel, battles, magic and betrayals. Something for all fantasy lovers; but more important, done with a quality that stands out and leaves you eager for more.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|This is, without question, the best Maiden DVD out yet. The documentary alone, capturing some of the very first band memebers (besides Steve, of course), is a triumph, but that's just one of the features. It picks up Maiden in 1976, well before their first album was released. Steve, many other members of the band, and folk involved in the musical business, tell the story of Maiden's slow build to their first album and, in fact, all the way through Piece of Mind. <br />Maiden started out as a small band playing in the clubs of England pretty much whenever they could. What kept them apart from other bands at the time was their relationship with the audience, which to this day hasn't changed and, in the '70s, Maiden's heavy sound was quite unique. Now, of course, many bands have this sound. These are only a few things you learn on the documentary. Other topics of discussion include: Where the twelve foot Eddie came from. The creation of the The Soundhouse Tapes. The band's turbulent attempts to play a perfect show to impress Rod Smallwood. And the inevitable chaotic events you'd expect from any rock band. Hey that's just the documentary. <br />Other goodies include previously released promo videos. However, some of these, have not been released. Running Free and Women in Uniform both have a video, which have never been seen before. There's also a real treat which is a concert taped with a home video camera on the day of release of their debut album. Maiden came back to their favorite pub the Ruskin Arms and played a killer gig. The quality of the movie sucks, but it does have the only known footage of Charlotte the Harlot and Another Life which includes the only drum solo by Clive Burr ever recorded. Amazing stuff. There's also another documentary for British TV called 20th Century Box which focuses on Maiden and actually, at the end, the whole song Iron Maiden is played live. The program is in black and white but it's still really cool. It also has people in it who are in the Maiden documentary so you can see how they've aged. Guess what? That's only part of the stuff on the second disc. <br />Disc number one is full of concerts. The first, Live at the Rainbow, was Maiden's first professionally recorded video. It's only half and hour but it the version of Killers has completely different lyrics that Paul Dianno made up in the dressing room before the show. And it sounds great. The show is, in short, brilliant. <br />The next show is Beast Over Hammersmith. It was never released, chiefly due to lighting and tech difficulties. I think, however, the concert rocks like no other. They play almost the whole Number of the Beast album and Eddie steps out to terrorize the audience. Spiffing! <br />Next concert was recorded for German TV in Dortmund on the Piece of Mind tour. The crowd is loud. The music rules and Maiden just took the place. It's just mind blowing. This band has proved themselves, climbing from the East End of London, all the way to number 1 albums and world tours. <br />This DVD is just too incredible to pass up. The price is right for over five hours of Maiden. It will melt your soul and fry your brain. IT'S THAT F*UCKING GOOD!!!!!!!!!!
B000007MVM|4.0|This is very disturbing record. It is made by someone who is seriously mentally ill and thought disordered. If your reading this you probably know the Syd Barrett story, he took a lot of LSD which made him psychotic and triggered schizophrenia from which he never recovered. The guy was a brilliant songwriter with Pink Floyd but those inventive childlike lyrics have given way to nonsense, as nonsense goes though this is probably the most beautiful i have ever heard. What i find interesting is the way that it seems that he made up the songs as he went along, clutching at words and phrases that rhyme or scan but have absolutely no relevance to anything at all. Terrapin is a wonderful song \\"well oh baby my hairs on end about you\\", its so fragile like a china cup, a cup that has three handles and no bottom. Golden Hair makes sense but he didnt write the words, James Joyce did. In some ways the very idea of recording some of these songs seems exploitative, this is a man in turmoil but his talent does come through and it was worth preserving that. Check out the other album \\"Barrett\\" for more of the same.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|The feel of the movie was like watching Terminator 1, replacing Arnold with Tom Cruise . Even thought this is fiction, the story was missing some touch of reality. How can a cab driver be forced to drive a killer around, with 100s of opportunites to get out of it? How can a killer walk into a club packed with police, kill the man he is looking for, and just get away? Too many questionable scenes like that in the movie. Tom Cruise did a good job playing the bad guy, not as good as Arnold though!
B00005R1N3|4.0|This film is scary.  Not a lot of gore, and it's better for it.   Good acting.  Some really great scenes.  The very very end is a bit disappointing, but otherwise I enthusiastically recommend this film if you're looking for a thriller for around the holidays.  If you have a friend who's into horror films and has never seen it, this would make a really good christmas gift.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|My wife complains because I have two cabinets of CDs for rock and roll. Although I have tunes from Gatemouth Brown to the New Pornographers, I divide rock and roll into genres based on whether someone started to release albums before or after this one. Don't tell me you know RnR unless you have this album. RIP, Joe.
B000002GYI|5.0|CLASSIC album.  Kraftwerk is so important to EVERY electronic act that followed that I can't really put it into words.  They made the foundation for all of it - ALL electronic music owes much to this group.  As such, Kraftwerk, that modest, polite group from (of all places) Dusseldorf has become one of the most important bands of all time.  Let me just underscore the point once more - EVERYONE - from Aphex Twin to Boards of Canada to Crystal Method... everyone owes something to the Kraftwerk.<br /><br />Today, listenting to this epic band (with their quirky and naive German sense of humor) is like having a \\"back to basics\\" course in musical history.  Going back to Kraftwerk is going to square one - hearing the clean, original ideas in electronic music clearly at the fore.  It is very cool to hear this album after all these years.<br /><br />If there is anything else that needs to be said I think it would be that Kraftwerk represents a little known element of the German character.  They are playful, witty, simple, humble and very idealistic.  Like wide eyed engineers creating a dream project, they forge the future with joy.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I love this cd, I love this band and have for years. EVERY song on this cd is great - well..I don't particulary like Are we Waiting but one out of 20. How many bands/cd do you know and listen to that you can say that about? Green Day is no one-hit wonder and I'm so glad they still rock. Billie Joe has an amazing voice, the harmonies and lyrics are great (my favorite is Blvd of broken dreams). It is great to see them having huge success again and if you get a chance to see them in concert - GO! My prediction is this band is around and here to stay...perhaps 25 years down the road they will still be playing and not just out to have a \\"reunion\\" tour to make money like some bands. Again, buy it, go see them and listen to the lyrics. Btw, I read an article where Stephen King gives this album his #1 of 2004..if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me.  I hope they clean up and perform at the Grammy's!
B00006V9A0|5.0|For those of you who are new fans, buy this, but as for me, ill just get the new box set.
B00005S6K8|4.0|This film is definetly different from the original, but I think Julia Ormond did a grand job. <br />Not only is she lovely, but she can act well. One of the main differences is the servants(Thats minor), and the fact that she goes to Paris for photography, instead of cooking. Which is to bad because thats one of the things I enjoyed about the original. <br />Still I think Julia makes a good Sabrina. <br />And I happen to love the lady that plays the spanish maid! I thought she was funny.  <br />Another actor was Harrison Ford. He was good as well. <br />David played by Greg Kinnear, was even sort of identical to the original David. I was impressed by his acting as well. <br />This has pretty much the same story line. The father is pretty much the same and I thought he was perfect for the part. This is still an enjoyable remake, though lacking some charm from the first. <br />Let's put it this way, it's modern! <br />Overall, I have seen it dozens of time and enjoy it. It was a good movie. I do not reccomend it as a remake, but as a comical enjoyable movie.
0316776963|5.0|Because of its dry wit and insights into people from all walks of life, this is one of the funniest books I've read in a long time--laugh out loud uncontrolably kind of funny. Being an American living in France, I can totally identify with his take on both cultures and thoroughly enjoyed his writing style.

B000002KHH|5.0|Thank god for Black Sabbath.  Without them just imagine how much worse music would be today.  There would be no Metallica which means no thrash and speed metal bands.  There would be no hair metal with Guns N Roses, etc.  Paranoid is easily Sabbath's best work.  Just listen to War Pigs, Paranoid, and Iron Man.  This CD is amazing not to mention arguably the most influential metal CD in the history of music.
B000001DV2|5.0|Adrenalize is yet another masterpiece by those incredible Leps, unfortunately this was the last good album they had.  When I first bought this in 2002 at age 14 I loved it and still do, but right away I could tell something was missing, and it was Steve \\"Steamin', The Riffmaster\\" Clark, the greatest guitarist in history, the songs just seemed to lack the fullness of guitars they had before, except for one.  Even so, this record is still excellent musicianship, and is way better than anything Nirvana, or Metallica or anybody else ever did.  It leads off with Lets get rocked, now soome people say that this song's lyrics are just dumb and cheesey, but I think that it is perfectly simple to understand, it's the motto of every teenage boy, party all night, sleep all day, and try your best to score with your girlfriend, all this with a great rocking background with killer guitar riffs and an amazing solo.  Next is Heaven Is, which is my favorite song on the record, its all about a drop dead gorgeous woman that is everything you've ever wanted, and the music is also great, full of wonderful melody and a great guitar riff and solo.  Make love like a man, is another song that people say has dumb lyrics, but they're wrong, the title sums up the idea of this song, grab a girl, love her like a man, and she'll feel alot better, and thats a fact.  Tonight, this is where the record slips, the mood is just to sedate and there is not much in the vein of guitars on this one, and the lyrics are a bit weird on this one, but still the point is being with a girl and making love to her.  White Lightning, a great song, but just a bit to long, the mood is dark and sad, filled with an eerie gutar lick, followed by a spooky riff and solo, the lyrics are a message about why you shouldn't experiment with drugs or alcohol, because, /you'll never laugh about it, you just can't live without it/ you've had enough, but you just want more, you'll never get what you're looking for/ you wanna leave butyou can't say no/ you wanna stop but you can't say no/, and musically its a tribute to Steve Clark, as are the lyrics about his unfortunate death.  Stand up kick love into motion, while a little better than Tonight, the mood is the same, to much pop not enough metal, though the lyrics are better and are about being in love, the guitar riff is a bit boring, but the solo is cool.  Personal Property, well this one is a bit of a killer/filler, its not as good as most of the songs, but is still worth a listen, the guitars are crunchy but are a little to uninteresting to bang your head to, the lyrics are about being a jealous man over your girlfriend.  Have you ever needed someone so bad, is a tremendous power ballad, and the only power ballad better is Love Bites, the guitars are great, heavy yet melodic, the vocals are perfect, and the words are all about loving someone that you're afraid you can't, but you're damn sure gonna try no matter what.  I wanna touch U, is an excellent song, with a great riff and awesome solo, the words are in the vein of Pour some sugar on me, its an, uh, ahem, SEX SONG.  Tear It Down is an amazing closing to the record, and its the only song that is graced by Steve Clark, its the only song that has the perfect fullness of guitars, and knocks the socks off Van Halen or Metallica, the words are all about a hot woman that you want to score with.  This album was definitely worthy of th 15 million copies it sold worldwide, as was Hysteria worthy of 18 million worldwide, and Pyromania 10 million in america alone, it seems Pyromania will never sell anywhere else.  Anyway buy this album and the others I mentioned and you'll ahve the best albums ever made, I never leave home without them.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I watched this back in 1983 too, I was just 11 years old and I think I had nightmares about it for months -- for the fact it scared me so much!  Special Effects were amazing back in 1983 and although not up to par with the likes of modern movies like \\"Armageddon, Deep Impact and The Day After Tomorrow, it's quite an accomplishment how this TV's based movie has withstood the test of time after 20+ years! The story may seem confusing to some in 2004 as most of the storyline is based on the actions of the Soviet Union (which of course has fallen) but the basis premise of \\"Nuclear War\\" on our homeland is still a story that most of us don't want to think  about and certainly makes us think about it after watching. I wish they had some of the news broadcasts that were on prior to the show to explain the reason for showing a movie like this that was bound to scare Americans, but they didn't give us any special bonuses, just the movie, nothing more.  But as a standalone movie, you should consider it. It's one of those \\"What if\\" movies.
B00005JN4O|4.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is the story of playwright J.M. Barrie (Depp) attempting to find his muse and create a successful play after a bomb.  He finds that muse in the Davies boys, Peter (highmore), George (Roud), Jack (Prospero), and Michael (Spill), one day in the park when he comes across them and their mother, Sylvia (Winslet) enjoying the day.  They quickly form a close friendship mush to the dismay of Barrie's wife and Sylvia's mother.  While playing make-believe with the kids, ideas start to form in his mind for the story that he will be best known for, \\"Peter Pan\\".<br /><br />This fictional biography is a very entertaining movie to watch.  The director has chosen to incorporate the imagination of the characters into the movie, and as viewers we see the world change back and forth between England and Neverland.  This is used just the right amount, and never becomes distracting.<br /><br />Depp is his usual excellent self, portraying Barrie as a slightly quirky individual who makes a connection with the Davies family.  The children do decent jobs as the source of his inspiration as well.  The greatest treat for fans of \\"Peter Pan\\" will be in how story points take shape, and what outside factors influence the story in progress.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" is well worth checking out, although it may be difficult to find as it is currently in limited release.
B00008FRMQ|5.0|Unlike other rock artists with superb debuts, Elvis Costello's sophomore release only improves on the strengths of his first release. The lyrics are sharper, the songs even more energetic, the production cleaner, and the players an actual road-tested band rather than the studio players. While I personally still enjoy My Aim is True slightly more (likely because I heard it first), most critics see this album or even its follow-up, Armed Forces, as Costello's early pinnacle.<br /><br />The sound and song structures are similar to his first album, but songs like \\"No Action\\" and \\"You Belong to Me\\" benefit from the improved backing band, both drums and organ. This base provides a more consistent sound that had been lacking in the previous album. The production also takes advantage of multi-tracking Costello's voice, so on many songs, like \\"Living in Paradise,\\" he provides his own background vocals.  Unlike later albums, the vocal track is clean and it is easy to understand the lyrics, something that should be de riguer for a man who has been called \\"a singing dictionary.\\"<br /><br />The highlight of this set is \\"Pump It Up,\\" that takes full advantage of the drum-organ combo, with the heavy beat that starts the song and continues to drive it throughout and the perfect chorus where the organ becomes almost as strong a percussion instrument in the beat-beat-triple-beat repetition.  Just as good is the song \\"Radio, Radio,\\" which flips the organ-drum combination so that the organ takes the lead and is supported by a somewhat muted snare. This song also has some of the best lyrics in rock, from the meta-descriptive \\"I want to bite the hand that feeds me...I want to make them wish they'd never seen me\\" to \\"radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools trying to anesthatize the way that you feel.\\"<br /><br />(This song also is a piece of television history, as Costello famously switched to this song rather than the one he had been scheduled to play during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, on the TV network that also owned and operated much of the radio at the time.)<br /><br />There's no one theme that connects the songs, unless you consider a general disdain for the subjects of his songs a theme.  If Costello came across as angry with his first album, herein he not just reinforced the idea but added even more bite to his bark.  However, it's only a step towards the nuclear assault that would be his next album, Armed Forces.y Night Live, on the TV network that also owned and operated much of the radio at the time.) <br /> <br />There's no one theme that connects the songs, unless you consider a general disdain for the subjects of his songs a theme.

B000002JEV|4.0|This album is absolutly amazing! I'am only 18 years old and this  great band was way before my time and I think that there is no other hard rock band ever like Led Zeppelin. This album is full  of great rare live recordings from the BBC Station. Songs like   \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\",\\"Dazed and Confuzed\\" and jaw dropping set of \\"Black Dog\\". \\"Going to California\\" is my favorite song on this album. It captures the acoustic side of Led Zeppelin. You should definitly buy this album now! Its  definitly worth it.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead is wonderful, YOU MUST buy this DVD!  <br />This is just a great, fun, zombie movie. <br />Simon Pegg and all are great. BUY it now for you or the zombie lover in your life.
B000053GTK|5.0|On this album, GG just goes crazy. This stuff is so creative, you won't believe.  The instrumentation is so varied: vibraphone, mandolin, string quartet, slide guitar, sax, and lots of great moog sounds of course. The songs are mind blowing. The main instrumental motif in the first track is so psychadelic, and in one part Derek Shulman sings a note that is unexpectedly low...you'll love it, it's so hilarious! \\"Experience\\" is one of those two-part GG songs like \\"Peel the Paint\\" and \\"I lost my Head\\". The best part in this song is an a capella section with two voices doing a contrapuntal thing. The dialogue between the two parts and the blend of the voices is beautiful. \\"Way of Life\\" is so incredibly trippy because the guitar follows a 4th below the incredibly strange vocal melody; this one might require multiple listenings before it starts to grow on you! At first it sort of sounds like the guy can't sing well, but you know that isn't the case. The title track rocks, mainly because the riff they use is so damn cool: \\"Shadow fills the light, until the glass house becomes the night\\"! This music is so fun, you'll want to dance I'm telling you. This is what prog rock is all about. Hail...
1592400876|5.0|Ignore those who seek to elevate themselves by looking upon this book with disdain, in particular the reviewer who wrote: <br /> <br />&#60;&#60; Interestingly enough, Ms. Truss doesn't even follow some of the more obvious grammar rules like &#34;Never end a sentence with a preposition&#34;, something that a stickler will notice time and time again in her text. &#62;&#62; <br /> <br />This so-called &#34;obvious grammar rule&#34; has never been a rule at all -- surely this individual has heard Winston Churchill's famous riposte when criticized for ending a sentence with a preposition: &#34;That is the sort of pedantic nonsense up with which I shall not put!&#34; <br /> <br />You'll search in vain for any authority who will put forth a ban on sentence-ending prepositions as an absolute hard and fast rule. <br /> <br />The English-writing world needs to know what's here. While there's no guarantee that any author's individual sense of humor will resonate with every single reader, this book -- by virtue of its already-established success -- is likely to be as good as it gets.
B00006M183|2.0|Pearl Jams 7th album \\"Riot Act\\" could of been there best and most satisfying listen if, as a band they actually cared a bit more about their band - namely their music and image. <br /> <br />For a start \\"Eddie Vedder\\" does'nt make more than half the effort he made on singing on their previous albums, which brings this album down a alot. <br />He seems to seem content to sing in the same tone the whole way through. <br /> <br />Also the production of this album should of been a bit more rawer and not so polished sounding (although it does'nt sound overly polished) it still misses out on that idea in a big way, as it could of improved the entire overall feeling of the album. <br /> <br />If you have seen Pearl Jams 2003 Show DVD \\"Live at the garden\\" the support tour of this album, you will know how bland and dull the band have become and they are now a shadow of there formerselfs. <br /> <br />Also image wise the band have lost its image, it looks like the a couple of the band members have gained to much weight and Eddie Vedders short hair does not match his voice or the image as a whole for the band. And really they are getting older and should of called it quits back in 1995 after they released \\"Merkinball\\". <br /> <br />You may scoff and say \\"that I should'nt judge a band by its image\\" but image and soul is just as important as the music, if you want your fans to actually care about what your doing. <br /> <br />It makes me upset to see an album with so much more potential go to waste, especially with a song with as much feeling such as \\"Thumbing My Way\\". <br /> <br />Pearl Jam  - either shape up or ship out. Literally. <br /> <br />
020530902X|5.0|I was going to title this review \\"Simply Indispensable,\\" but - following Strunk & White's advice - I omitted the adverb as it doesn't strengthen or clarify the verb like you'd think it would.<br /><br />The Elements of Style (Third Edition) is a tremendous help in understanding what makes words flow on a page. I understand that the Fourth Edition takes steps for greater gender equity in its examples, in addition to making other minor tweaks to the 1979 edition. I don't think you can go wrong with either.<br /><br />The first dozen or so pages tackle the thorniest grammar problems (possessives, subject/verb agreement, pronouns, etc.) and the remainder of the book focuses on how to make your writing clearer and more accessible by the reader. It's here we get the indispensable advice of \\"Omit needless words\\" and \\"Place emphatic words of a sentence at the end.\\" Tips like these turn poorly constructed writing into literary gold - just look what it did for my review title: pure gold.<br /><br />There is also a subtle wry sense of humor running through the book. In section 4 (Words & Expressions Commonly Misused), Strunk & White make this observation regarding nauseous/nauseated: \\"The first means `sickening to contemplate'; the second means `sick at the stomach.' Do not, therefore, say `I feel nauseous,' unless you are sure you have that effect on others.\\" From the section 5.17: Do not inject opinion, \\"To air one's views gratuitously, however, is to imply that the demand for them is brisk, which may not be the case....\\" Granted, Strunk & White are no Martin & Lewis, but this little text is far from dull and dry.<br /><br />There are other style manuals available in print and online, but at about 100 pages (the Third Edition was a mere 85), Strunk & White's Elements of Style will likely deliver the advice you need before you've thumbed halfway through the index of the others.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Live it. You'll be glad you did.
0099452294|4.0|A few weeks back, in search of something good to watch at the video store, I picked up Kevin Macdonald's Touching the Void documentary from the shelf. As I was skeptically reading the back of the DVD case, the fellow standing next to me said that it was a &quot;really good movie.&quot; I took him on his word and later disovered a movie that I have since been raving about to all who will listen. It is a riveting story in which an injured climber is left for dead on a Peruvian mountain and manages to crawl his way off. It sounds like fiction, but, as is often the case, this true story is incredible beyond what a writer could believable construct. So, when I found out that Joe Simpson (the climber left on the mountain) had written a book, Touching the Void about his harrowing adventure, I knew I needed to read it.<br />The movie and the DVD extras take the viewer on an emotional path where one at first dislikes the arrongant and impetuous Simpson, while his climbing pal Simon Yates seems more sympathetic. However, as the movie continues and especially if you watch the Return to Siula Grande DVD extra, it becomes hard not to empathize with Simpson's reaction to returning to the place where he had faced so much trauma and to, in contrast, find Yates cold and unfeeling, as if the experience they shared so many years before no longer affected him personally. The end of the movie leaves one with the impression that Simpson, although understanding at what Yates did, does not really like Yates and does certainly not consider him a friend.<br />The book, written several years earlier, certainly leaves a more positive impression of Yates. While Simpson admits to having written the book in part to clear Yates's name in the climbing communitry, his storytelling takes the reader beyond a defense of Yates's actions. In fact, Simpson's description of Yates's attempt to lower the injured Simpson down the mountain portrays an act that is nothing short of heroic. It is clear that his cutting the rope was a last, desperate resort to end a situation in which there was no way out.<br />While the book and the movie both tell very closely the same story, reading the book and seeing the movie is neither a redundant experience nor an exercise in detecting differences in the two plots. In fact, the one enriches the story in the other. The maps and the first-person telling in the book complement the documentary-style script and the sweeping vistas caught on film.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Ok, the review at the top of this page is ridiculous.  The people who will laugh at this film don't necessarily think themselves better than Napoleon.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill is yet another great film from the creator of Pulp Fiction.  Kill Bill is was one of my favorite films in 2003 and I'm very glad to see a DVD edition out.  It is a great film it has style, it's funky, it's fresh and it just plain rocks.  The film is a simple Revenge movie but it's not what you're expecting, trust me it's from QT man!  I'm not going to get into plot but I will say the cast is amazing with Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madeson and the list go's on! <br /> <br />The Movie has little dialoug unlike the rest of Tarantino's Movies like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown ect.  Also I must say the film seemed abit cheesy if you ask me but that doesn't stop you from enjoying this film.  The film also has a great sets of music and I will be getting the soundtrack soon. <br /> <br />Awwwhhh yet again..here go's another one of my opinions on how violent this film is(I seem to critisize films that are overhyped by the violence i.e Dog Soldiers ect)And frankly you people don't know what graphic Violence is if you really thought that this film was \\"graphic\\".  I read some reviews from a school that lets college students write there review and I must say this is complete Horse crap.  This films violence is not Disturbing nor graphic you people just can't handle violence.  I MEAN WHEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD SLICED OFF YOU DON'T HAVE CLEAR LOOKING BLOOD SQUIRTING OUT OF YOUR NECK LIKE THE WAY SHOWERS DO!  The violence (as some people who know what is violent)is very, very unrealistic.  The film is not graphic nor disturbing but It's violent alright and pretty Bloody.  The Bride Slices and dices her way through the final Battle in this film and it's superb the way they Choreagraphed(sorry if I spelled it wrong).  As I have said before if you people who haven't seen the film and plan on seeing it don't worry this film is not Disturbing or violent at all it's just that \\"some\\" people can't handle fake cheesy violence.   <br /> <br />This film is superb, great acting,great action, simple yet great plot but one thing that really ticks my tocker is this film was butcherd because of the MPAA.  The film was \\"censored\\" so to speak in the U.S because some of the violence was too \\"extreame\\" for them and the \\"audience\\".  If it wasn't for dumb idiots in america getting hooked on GTA and doing all that crap we wouldn't have some films butchered, I mean it's not our fault some people in this world are idiotic enough to go out and get a gun and shoot up the mall just cause some video game character did.  The film was censored here and U.S and I hope Tarantino makes a 2 disc Special editon Unrated Directors Cut.  I have the Japanes version of the film mainly cause it has waaaaaaaaay better extras then the U.S version.  If I were to Rated this for the DVD itself I would have givin it 3 stars but I'm doing the film only.  The films only major parts that cut so Tarantino can get his \\"R\\" rating was to take some kills out of the final battle in the House of Blue Leaves and he had to make it black and white, not to mention he had to take out the part were Bride Cuts Sophies other arm off in the Car...ewww Poor Sophie.  But over all I acctually choose the U.S version over the Japanes version mainly cause of the black and white scenes.  If you didn't know already the House of Blue Leaves battle was in full color in the Japanes version unlike the U.S version which is in B and W, still I choose the B and W over the japanes ones I just hope that Tarantino makes some better extras when he releases a special editon of this film. <br /> <br />Over all Though Censored here in the U.S, Kill Bill is a superb movie with excellent fights, pretty good story, Awesome actors and really characters, though the Violence is cheesy and fake the is suppose to be like that and the film doesn't try to be nothing els but a movie.  That's why I get this film a  <br /> <br />4.5 out of 5 stars... <br /> <br />Kill Bill Vol 2 is waaaay better then this one though..
B00005J8JI|5.0|I just can't understand why people write reviews if they don't like a band and are quite unfamiliar with the material,why bother? <br />All vinyl replicas from the UK and Japan(more expensive but with the characteristic OBI) are nice to have for the packaging alone as the sound is the same as the regular remastered edition.This album was compiled by Page as an overall view of the band in '82.Check the 'see all my reviews' feature for my comments on the album for the regular edition.The gatefold sleeve features a great compilation of photographs and the CD has the Swan Song artwork amazingly reproduced.Better to have an album of outtakes than countless 'best of','greatest hits with one new song',which Zeppelin never released until the compact two-disc Remasters in the mid nineties,now out of print.'I Can't Quit You Baby' is not an alternative take but the live take from the Albert Hall '70 as is 'We're Gonna Groove',both available on the DVD 'Led Zeppelin'. <br />Anyone remotely familiar with Led Zeppelin knows how Jimmy Page engineered the sound of the band around the drums,it's no accident that Bonzo(John Bonham)is omnipresent,that was his main characteristic! <br />Anyway,if you can spend the cash for the packaging all the series is amazingly produced,if not,the regular edition souns just as good and is affordable.
6304712499|2.0|This is movie is based on my favorite comic \\"hero\\" and it ends up sucking.  I'm not even going to say anything except that  <br /> <br />1.They should have let Todd McFarlane write and direct this <br />2.Hollywood should get shot for making this film <br />3.PG-13?  Are you kidding me...this ain't no kiddy comic man! <br /> <br />This film was just terrible but I must say the CGI is terrific in this film but that's it....Unlike the comics or animated series you won't find.. <br />Profanity <br />Graphic Violence <br />Disturbing imagry and this list go's on. <br /> <br />Even in this \\"Directors Cut\\" there are only two major difference in this and the PG-13 one which is...Al says a naughty word!!!  Oh my gosh!  And the other one is him shooting that girl in the head... <br /> <br />This movie flat out sucks... <br /> <br />2.1 out of 5 stars.... <br /> <br />If you really wanna watch Spawn it's all hell and out of controll way watch the Animated Series from HBO. <br /> <br />Thats All I gotta say... <br /> <br />Lates
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I rate this dvd a 10 on the \\"pint-o-meter\\".  The outtakes are hilarious.  For an aspiring screen-writer, there's a feature under \\"raw-meat\\" that contains footage of simon and edgar going through their \\"flip-chart\\" of ideas, plans, and...irregular drawings.  These let us view into their world and see what was on their minds as they spawned such a creative plot and characters.  the casting tapes were excellent as well.  Watching simon's video diary made me crack up because it showed the informality in structure.  it shows how much fun they really had behind the scenes...the atmosphere did not seem stressful for one bit.  But my heart goes out to the most creative part of the extras: the plot holes.  everything that was left unexplained? explained.  simple as that.  not to mention, the answers will keep you rolling with laughter.  these features are just compliments to an already amazing movie.  Buy it today and remember: aim for the head. <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I had the opportunity to meet with Simon Pegg, Ed Wright and Nick Frost when they had the Shaun of the Dead premier here in Denver, Colorado. The college newspaper I work for sent me to cover the zombie movie. It took me by surprise. As a long time Romero (Original Dead series) fan, I was surprised to find a new zombie movie out. When I got to the theatre, I was surprised to find about a hundred other people waiting in line to see it. This is a comedy love story. With zombies. And it is amazing. If your looking for a good laugh, go here. This will not dissapoint. I wwont give the story away, so this isn't much of a review. But, I believe, that once you see it, you will see what I mean. Again, this is a great movie. Go check it out! NOW! GO! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO!
0064407667|5.0|the bad beginning is everything a person could want in a book.mystery,suspense,misery,humour and reverse psychology.this book is excellent!i have only read the first three in the series and am gettin the rest for xmas.this series is depressing but there is humour added in which makes it so unique!try the series ,and if you don't thats ur problem,cause ur missin out on somthin not to be missed!
0920668372|5.0|I received this as a shower gift and I really do love it.  It is a sweet story of a mother's unconditional love for her son and how she expresses her love through a song that she sings him each night as he sleeps.  Then as a grown man, he encorporates that piece of his childhood into his expression of unconditional love for his own daughter. The story was inspired by the author's own personal tragedy after having two stillborn sons.  True, it is an emotional story and, yes, I do get weepy as I read it to my son.  I also bought copies for several of my friends (along with the accompanying cd)and they all loved it as well.  I was sort of surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I just don't get why some people think it's creepy.  I didn't get any creepy feelings about the story and didn't think the mother was too clingy.  I think some people just read WAY too much into things.  Some reviewers even questioned where the son's father is throughout the story...ummm, I thought this was a children's story - not reality television.  And aren't most children's books based in fantasy and metaphor?    Anyway, there was one reviewer I do agree with who noted that people either seem to love this story or hate it.  If you think you won't be able to get past the details to enjoy the story's message then maybe this isn't the book for you.  My recommendation is to read the story before buying it or especially before giving it as a gift.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I saw the original movies in the theatre when they were first released. Lucas decided in his \\"supposedly\\" rich future that he change his movies to what he \\"had wanted\\". He initially changed parts of the movie when he released a fixed version of the VHS tapes. Some of the stuff was good and some was not a good thing like having Greedo shoot at Han Solo in the cantina first........they changed a good part and ruined and not just ruined by adding the extra thing but the revamp was so horribly done that it makes it even more the crap. He made many other screwups to a classic that should never have been touched. <br /> <br />Now after many years of waiting Lucas releases Epi. 4-6 only to destroy the Return of the Jedi. For some rediculous reason they took away the original old Anakin Skywalker in his ghost form and add the young Anakin to the ghost trio. HOW STUPID ARE YOU LUCAS!!!!!!!! WHY IS KENOBI NOT YOUNG THEN OR YODA?! GET A GRIP AND STOP MESSING UP MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES AND STOP WASTING PEOPLE'S MONEY. <br /> <br />What he did was like having Van Goeh come back and change his mind on a painting after it is in a museum. Do yourself a favor and look for these on old VHS. You will be happier you did.
B000006OS2|1.0|While this is one of my all time favorites I made the mistake of not reading the reviews of the product.  Horrible video transfer.  Stay away, do not buy.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|About the movie: This movie is great! It is has to be the best film of 2004. It has a very original story, unexpected twists, great acting (including child acting). This is Ashton Kutcher's first serious role in a movie, and he does it wonderful. Nonetheless he is not the only one that can play different roles. Every character in the movie shows different personalities. <br />The effects are great, it is well directed, and everyone who loves time travel storys (Back To The Future, especially), will like this movie. <br /> <br />About the DVD: It has to be one of the most complete DVDs I ever seen. Infinifilm is actually great! The best thing about this DVD are the deleted scenes, and the Alternate Endings (3 different endings, plus the theatrical one). A lot of EPKs featuring the making of the film, story boards, and some documentaries about time travel and the origin of The Butterfly Effect term. The Director's Cut version of the film is quite interesting. I prefer the original version, but this one has its strenghts and weakneases just like the theatrical version. <br /> <br />Ok then, this DVD is a must have. Don't miss it!
0792844890|5.0|The great Mel Brooks has done it once again.This extremely funny movie is basically a comedy version of \\"Star Wars\\".Its the story of Lone Star and his sidekick Ralph(John Candy), who are asked to rescue Princess Vespa from Lord Helmet(Rick Moranis), who has taken her hostage.Accepting the job from her father the King of planet Druidia for a million space bucks, they go in for the kill(figure of speech).When they finally save, Lord Helmet still trys to come after them, but in the end they get taken out.You will get a kick out of this movie.Definetly see it.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Before you watch this movie, take a deep breath and prepare yourself to be pulled into poetry.  If you are a sentimental sort, it is advisable to keep a few tissues handy.  That's what this is, a sentimental movie.  I am not a fan of the overly sentimental, mushy love story movies that are termed \\"chick flicks\\".  Yet this is one of my faviorite movies.    Watching this movie is like falling in love, not so much with the handsome prince that courts Danielle, whom he does not know to be a commoner, or even with Danielle herself, though she is an admirable enough character, and in my opinion very well portrayed by Drew Barrymore.  No, what really got me about this movie was the way it combined the hard facts of reality with the romance of a fairy tale, and all in an age that is a step back from today.    The movie makes a point of showing the soot on Danielle's hands from the hard labor she endures, the calusses left there.  She does not wake up in the morning and look pretty.  But when she means to, she can borrow her stepmother's clothes and look lovely.  I'm glad they did not cast some overly glamorous actress for this film.  Drew Barrymore is pretty, but not nearly as glamourous as the actress that plays Marguerite, Danielle's wicked stepsister.  Yet there are moments in the film when something truly seems to be shining out of Barrymore's eyes that makes her the most beautiful woman in the room.  In particular, the ball scene at the climax of the movie.    There's the appearance of Leonardo Da Vinci, which, while i'm not sure is entirely historically correct, adds another dimension of magic to the film.  He is the man who walks on water and builds kites, and, when the time comes, he serves the wonderful role as fairy-godfather to Danielle.  'A bird may love a fish, but where would they live?', Danielle says to him of her love for Prince Henry.  'Well, I shall have to make you wings' he replies.  And he does.    The movie is filled with articulae, well voiced lines like that, in front of settings that really bring you there, and beautiful music played with such perfect timing that, if you haven't already been, will sweep you away.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Yes this movie is one of the funniest, goofiest, weirdest movies i have ever seen.However i do have to give it much credit because it is a brilliant movie, with a guaranteed laugh in every scene.King Arther is seeking brave and worthy knights his round table.But whn he finds several that are worthy, the Lord gives them a sacred quest for they holt grail.Throughout the movie , they search through thick in thin.They run into things like goofy French knights, three headed knights, knights who say \\"Ni\\",fortune tellers, a castle full of hot chicks, an enchanter, and finally, a killer bunny rabit with nasty , big, pointy teeth.The ending was kind of disapointing, but what do you expect, its comedy.Also , some of the scenes where rather violent and bloody and i still dont know why this movie was rated PG. Oh well.Definetly see this movie.You will be glad you did.
006092988X|5.0|I absolutely adore this book and recommend it to everyone every chance I get!  I identified so much with Francie in her relationship with her family.  I also admired her strength through all that happened.  My favorite part is when they are getting the christmas tree chucked at them and they have to stay standing to win it.  Francie was always thought of to be frail and weak b/c that's how she looked while her younger bro. looked strong and healthy but when the tree hit them, the bro. went to his knees and Francie jerked him back up even tho it hit her in the head.  The book has great insight and narrative.  It is a wonderful read.
B00005JN0T|4.0|The movie starts by showing the Three Laws of Robotics. They appear within what are the workings of a robots positronic brain. Though taken from a number of short stories by Isaac Asimov, do not expect it to be faithful. It is a fast paced detective story. Filled with action and many great special effects.     Will Smith plays our detective, Del Spooner, and suspects a robot of murder. He believes a robot, called Sonny is the murderer. Though no one else can even conceive of such a concept. He follows a trail of clues that leads him toward solving the case. Will is his usual self in this movie...just in better shape.     In contrast, we have Dr. Susan Calvin played by Bridget Moynahan. She believes that Sonny did not commit murder. For it would violate the main law of the Three Laws of Robotics, that is hardwired into each robot. She starts off true to the Asimov character, but evolves, as all good characters should in a good movie.     Though a Sci-Fi/Action Adventure movie. Its plot is that of a murder mystery. And in that aspect, I think this movie was well done. And you will be thrown a twist during the course of the movie. If that is not enough for you. You may just want to watch a movie for great action and fun.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|As a mother of a pre-teen I am responsible for censoring her music, while, at the same time, being subjected to her tastes.  I find that Lavigne's sophomore album has a more mature sound than her first, while still maintaining the teen pop/alternative sound. The whole family can listen to this CD, and I have had many of my adult friends ask to \\"borrow\\" the CD for further review.  I agree with one reviewer who suggested that \\"Don't Tell Me\\" should be required listening for teenage boys and girls. This is exactly the type of message that teens should be listening to.  The music is catchy, the lyrics are simple and that is exactly what it should be, uncomplicated fun teen music.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I have enjoyed the Harry Potter series. And hope to see them continue the movies. This was a fun movie to watch. But I was suprised that it was so short. This is also the darkest movie yet. As would be expected from director Cuaron. Though they do stick close to the plot of the book. <br /> <br />The movie starts off with Harry at home with the Dursley's. And as usual they are making his life miserable...but we see that Harry is not only older, but has some power. For his uncle seems a little scared of him. But they still manage to get him to run away from home. He takes a ride on a triple decker bus for wayward wizards; and we follow for a ride of our lives. Harry soon learns that Sirus Black has escaped from prison and is coming to kill him. The guards of the wizard prison are scary dark-robed Dementors that suck out your soul until you are dead. And they are searching for Black, but for some reason they seem to feed on Harry's soul every chance they get. <br /> <br />Once he and the gang are back in school we watch as they go on their adventures of mischief. The classes seem harder and we get to see a real nice renderaing of a hippogriff. And once again we have a new professor for the Defense Against Dark Arts class. Who has a secret of his own. Where we depart from the other movies, is that we get to see the outside of Hogwarts. The full layout of Hogwarts, the surrounding landscape and get a feel for where it is located. You can almost get a feel for what it would be like to be there. The scenery is breath taking, showing that filming on location in Scotland was the correct choice. <br /> <br />I would have given the movie five stars, but it left too much out. I think that this movie need to be 3 hours long. They glossed over some things and are missing some important details. Making some parts of the movie seem to not flow smoothly. But the movie is good and should be in every Harry Potter fans library.
0811821846|5.0|I'm one of those subversive types who likes to get kids out of their gender roles every once in a while.  This book and the second one have been great hits as birthday presents for a number of boys we know who would ordinarily think of cooking as \\"girl stuff.\\"  Parents all reported that their sons became interested in cooking as a result of receiving these books and have gone on to give them as gifts themselves.<br /><br />There are also a couple of recipes that *I* return to again and again for family meals because they're simple, quick and delicious.
B00005RIKD|5.0|The first time inserted the CD in my player,the first time I heared that sound, I tought it was a mistake.Was it realy sting? I knew him from the times of the police, and the choc was big....this is a wonderfull Jazz-fusion, live recorded, not a big sugar-cake like \\"everyting she does is magic\\"..... <br />the first track, \\"A thousand Years\\" is a softly  played song,with a great bass-line played by Sting.the ones how know his importants albums will notice that most songs are mixed-in. a great Idea. the final track, \\"every breath you take is a explosion of music, a real big-bang! Sting, you are great..... <br />
6305161879|5.0|... of the 80s and ranks as an all-time high. My father has worn out several copies and luckily it`s on dvd now hehehe. Kevil Kline leads a stellar cast; I am giving flower-greetings to the entire cast and crew. Enough said.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybird Theory is better than Meteora. I got this album 2 years ago, and I listen to it because it never gets old. I'm not a big Linkin Park fan (tho I do have a poster on my wall) but I think this is a good album because all the cuts are strong and hard. I saw the video for 'Crawling' 3 years ago, and it still gives me chills... buy it, its worth your money!
B000056HE9|5.0|.... back in the 70s I watched it with her and she couldn`t get over it... Her husband was tragically killed in South-Africa in 1946 at the the age of 36 and was dying to bring her over from Norway after he had witnessed films in Radio City Music Hall...<br /><br />As I saw it yesterday on DVD, the movie talked to me - indeed I think as it did to my grandma in the 70s... The day after she watched it, she continued to marvel at its greatness and how much she enjoyed Cary Grant.  Cary Grant was born the same year - on that same date as her - and ever since then - Mr Grant has held a special place in my heart... Sentimental reasons I know... but the film is still as magical as it must have been at the time of its initial release.<br /><br />I hail it as the all-time-xmas film:-)  PS: Don`t miss the funny trailer hehehe
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Presto is a spectacular album which shows the way Rush intended modernity in the nineties. The music Rush produced in this long awaited follower to Hold Your Fire is an electric funk rock type of thing, mixed with elements taken from jazz (in very few passages I must admits) and pop. Geddy's bass is in first place here and what a delight it is! The Presto project works because the music is extremely well written and played. The sound of the whole album is transparent which doesn't mean it is not balanced or that it lacks headroom or basses equalization. Simply it is clear, transparent. I might call it a spectacular production because every sound is clear, intelligible and present. I have the original cd, not the remastered edition which I am not able to find in Italy actually because eventually I would buy it too. Anyway talking about the tunes there are here some true Rush masterpieces. The opener Show don't tell it's an incredible anthem, it kicks, it funks, it moves you! Please bass players and drummers learn how to push a tune, how to use syncopations! Geddy shines here!! This album comprehends some other infectious \\"funk-rock\\" tunes like Scars, Chain lightining, a sort of \\"Distan early Warning\\" (which is Red tide), two extremely well written \\"pop\\" songs (near some Tears for Fears things) \\"Available light\\" and \\"Hand over fist\\" which will stuck in your mind and will never get out of it. There's even space for a true pop-rock like Superconductor which was the single at the time if I remember well. Pass, War paint and Anagram are the most evocative tunes here. They could be a little heavy ... I'm honest sometimes they bored me, but sometimes I love them. Sure I prefer the more funky tunes here. Presto remain one of the Rush album I love the most and it is true, it is one of the albums where keys really do works for Rush. I love this album for its incredible musical value even if it remember me one of the worst nights of my youth. Probably the worst. A night which could change everything forever ... I have been lucky I guess.<br /><br />I listened to available light a lot of times that night. PRESTO!ould change everything forever ... I have been lucky I guess.  <br /> <br />I listened to available light a lot of times that night. PRESTO!
B00005JN4O|5.0|One wouldn't normally describe a film as being lovely, but it's the first word that comes to mind, well, mine at least, when trying to put together thoughts on Finding Neverland. The second, perhaps, would be sad. That last word, however, is misleading. In the context of this film, sadness is uplifting as it reaffirms one's belief in the power of believing. <br /> <br />For as long as I can remember, the story behind a story/novel/poem/etc. has fascinated me. In the case of Peter Pan, it was the story of how Barrie came to fashion the Lost Boys, and the idea of a child who refused to grow up. I knew from reading a brief biography of Barrie that the loss of his brother at a young age had a severe effect on their mother, which impacted Barrie's own grief. And I was glad to see that that event was mentioned in this film, beautifully illustrating the idea that children should be children while they are able to, and that childhood can disappear, before its time, in the blink of an eye. This film is by no means a faithful biography of Barrie, but then I don't think it was meant to be. There is truth in certain aspects, but there are fabrications as well, which no doubt were intended to heighten the drama of the many relationships involved. As an example, the viewer comes to care a great deal about the unstated, but deeply felt, feelings that Barrie and Sylvia (the mother of the Davies boys) share, which wouldn't have been possible if the makers of the film had followed history and had Sylvia's husband alive as he actually was when the boys met Barrie. The feelings between those two make the ending that much more sad and rather bittersweet. I wouldn't have changed that for the world. Not even for the sake of being more true to life. <br /> <br />The film, in its entirety, is quiet and bright, simple in its expression, but extremely meaningful. It obviously wasn't a lavish production and yet the scenes were rich and the settings nicely detailed. As a viewer, you don't doubtthe authenticity of the time it is portraying, which adds overall credibility to the film. <br /> <br />Now, onto the acting. Johnny Depp. Luckily for us, he always has something to offer. A film could be completely unremarkable and yet he manages to make his role unforgettable. Depp personifies the type of actor who slips into the skin of the character he is playing, learning him inside and out, who brings forth all of the mannerisms and quirks that speak of a greater understanding of humanity than most could hope for. But to put it more simply, it comes down to a matter of belief. I, myself, have never doubted him in any role. No matter the time period, or how fantastical his performance may seem, you believe in him. What a wonderful trait for the actor portraying Barrie to have. You believe in him. Kate Winslet, in her role, was wonderful. She exuded an inner happiness and faith and her presence on screen was just glowing. Towards the end of the film when she is viewing the play based on her boys, well, she has never been more beautiful. They couldn't have cast the role better. And as for the boys, each and every one was charming and deserving of recognition for their performances. <br /> <br />Finding Neverland reminds us of the importance of imagination and wonder. And, of course, in believing. Believing in life, believing in things that can't necessarily be seen, but also believing in yourself.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin helped me survive my years in junior high! Nothing can compare to this album of theirs - really one of the perfect albums of the 1970's (Ziggy Stardust is another). I would highly recommend this one. Zeppelin is like a mixture of blues and classic rock - very good stuff!
B0006WIP90|5.0|This is my favorite book from childhood, period. Should be in every child's collection.
B0006284JQ|1.0|So you think you've heard awful music before, right?  Air Supply's soft rock ditties have made you feel ill, Milli Vanilli has made your cringe, and Vanilla Ice has made you laugh out of pity.  But this, my friends, is the quintessential collection of terrible music - all synthesizers and drum machines, with lyrics so simplistic you'll wonder if the writer made it past the first grade.  Add to that the tone-deaf voice of one Ms. Britney Spears, and you've got a Molotov cocktail of the worst \\"music\\" imaginable.  Armed forces units should blast this CD over loudspeakers in order to get their enemies hiding out in bunkers to surrender - I'm sure they will do so peacefully. <br /> <br />Here's a track by track review of this awful CD (rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest): <br /> <br />1). My Prerogative - The Bobby Brown song made a statement, while this is just pointless whining (notice she is talking and whispering, not singing).  Gutter trash.  (0/10) <br /> <br />2). Toxic - My friends, the title says it all.  Lame James Bond ripoff combined with very corny, infantile lyrics (\\"Baby can't you see, I'm calling / A guy like you should wear a warning\\").  (0/10) <br /> <br />3). I'm A Slave 4 U - First of all, it's \\"for you\\", not \\"4 U\\".  Second, more pointless ramblings about her sexuality.  Third, if she were my slave, I'd tell her never to sing again.  (0/10) <br /> <br />4). Oops! I Did It Again - A work of art, right up there with Mozart.  That Titanic bit where they talk about the \\"old lady\\" and \\"pearl necklace\\" is just pure genius.  Yeah, sure.  She sounds like a 5 year old on this song.  (0/10) <br /> <br />5). Me Against The Music - Exactly ... she is against the music.  If she wanted to do something positive for the industry, she would quit, forever!  (0/10) <br /> <br />6). Stronger - Very cheesy, basically about how she's not lonely anymore.  More poorly written, poorly sung nonsense.  (0/10) <br /> <br />7). Everytime - Very sickening ballad, proves just how weak her voice is.  She's basically bawling like a baby throughout the whole thing instead of singing.  One of the worst songs here.  (0/10) <br /> <br />8). ...Baby One More Time - Her first single, with the annoying \\"oh baby, baby\\" hook.  Subservient lyrics combined with synthetic music set the standard for which she built her entire career.  (0/10) <br /> <br />9). (You Drive Me) Crazy - The most heard song at your local Chuck E. Cheese, probably.  \\"You drive me crazy / I just can't sleep / I'm so excited / I'm in too deep\\".  Really profound stuff, I'm sure Bob Dylan and David Bowie are shaking in their boots now.  (0/10) <br /> <br />10). Boys - Wow, she's singing about boys again.  She draws from such a diverse palette of topics for her songs, doesn't she?  Cheesy lite-dance number.  (0/10) <br /> <br />11). Sometimes - \\"Sometimes I'm scared of you / But all I really want is to hold you tight\\" ... sounds like it's from a love letter to a stalker.  Another awful ballad, shows how artificial her voice sounds.  (0/10) <br /> <br />12). Overprotected - Here, Britney gripes about being held down and told what to do.  Because we all know she doesn't want to run around practically naked in her videos - someone told her to do it.  Yeah, Britney, way to stick it to the man - that's my girl!  Listen to the bridge after the second chorus - some of the most juvenile lyrics ever.  (0/10) <br /> <br />13). Lucky - About a girl who has everything but still wants more, which makes the sound autobiographical, I guess.  And the girl's name just happens to be Lucky - yeeeaaaah, riiiiiiight.  The cheesy subject matter, synthesized melody, and lyrics (Early morning / She wakes up / Knock knock knock on the door) make this one of the worst songs here. (0/10) <br /> <br />14). Outrageous - You mean this song is called outrageous?  No way!  She only says the word, like, 1000 times in the song.  Get outta here!  Terrible lyrics (Outrageous / my sex drive / outrageous / my shopping spree).  (0/10) <br /> <br />15). I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - That's right, she's neither a girl or a woman.  She must be an alien, because only an alien would lack the compassion to subject us to such terrible songs over and over again, like this maudlin ballad.  (0/10) <br /> <br />16). I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) - Thanks for the warning, I think I'll go somewhere far away now.  (0/10) <br /> <br />17). Do Somethin' - Yeah, I'll \\"do somethin'\\" - like use this CD as fertilizer.  (0/10) <br /> <br /> <br />In summary: Britney Spears may not be able to sing a note in tune and may record childish pop songs, but hey - she sure can go out there in tight leather jumpsuits and shake what her mama gave her!  She's living proof that talent is secondary for success in the music industry - as long as you're attractive and know the right people, you can make lots of money.  Greatest Hits: My Prerogative is terrible, but then again, it's not the songs you're buying - it's the product.  Girls want to be like her and boys want to be with her.  But this album is not worth owning - you'll listen to it once and then it will collect dust on your shelf.  It's the sound of a cheesy teen pop artist desperately trying to prolong her 15 minutes of fame.
0393317552|3.0|The whole purpose of writing this book, as the author Jared Diamond freely admits, is to debunk the notion that the human race, culture and traditions had anything to do with the striking differences of the technological progress achieved by different societies on different continents throughout history. His main postulate is that only in the Fertile Triangle of the Middle East were there the right conditions, such as climate, choice of plants and animals to be domesticated etc., to favor food production on a grand scale. These favorable conditions in turn allowed other technological developments, which resulted in  until recently - the technological preeminence of Western civilization. According the Diamond, any other group of humans given the same opportunities would have fared in the same way. Thus, he puts the onus on geography and environment, one of the few theories in the evolution of human societies, which has been kicking around for some time. In support of this, he provides an endless litany of examples, mostly conjectural and hypothetical. <br />Diamond speaks from a totally anthropocentric position: anything and everything in the world throughout recorded, or at least archeologically documented human history, is weighted from the perspective of its usefulness to humans. He seems to completely lack compassion for the non-human living creatures and the biosphere in general. His only concern is how to best exploit the Earth and use all living things to the benefit of man. Given his antiracist position, this anthroporacism is offensive. <br />Somewhat surprisingly for such a politically correct author, is his implicit advocacy of eugenics by stating that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners because only the fittest and smartest survived throughout their history of high mortality from murder, chronic tribal warfare, accidents and problems in procuring food. In contrast, Europeans have diluted the quality of their genetic pool by allowing to survive live-born infants fatal infections as well as reproduce themselves, regardless of their intelligence and the genes they bear (sic) (Prologue paperback ed. p. 20 - 21).<br />Lastly, one idiosyncratic note: in the Prologue Diamond takes great pains to assure the reader that he is sublimely qualified to write a complete and definitive book on this subject by the virtue of his upbringing, education, and professional and personal experience. Perhaps, this might have been better left for a reviewer to decide.
B00008H2LB|1.0|They are not heavy, their riffs suck, Chester looks like Justin Timberlake, and everything they do is WEAK. Go buy some real metal. Not Korn, Disturbed, or Mudvayne either, they all suck as well. I mean Soilwork, Inflames, AT the GAtes, Dissection, Decapitated. Yeah you know actualy music.
B000058983|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever, a snap shot of the times, of the turmoil and curdled peace and love philosophy. Arthur Lee is one of the most uncredited genius' in music, often lingering in the shadows of Jimi Hendrix and George Clinton, two other prominent black musicians of the era. If not for Lee's love of isolation and massive drug habit he probably could have become a well remembered psychedelic giant. This album is vastly different from the Love recordings perceding it. Their self titled debut was proto punk rock and its follow up, Da Capo, mostly treaded the same path. Da Capo only offered a glimmer of the excellence that Lee would later orchestrate in Forever Changes. Lee was fed up with the false peace and love ideals that were being spread about and instead concentrated his music on more dark subject matters such as isolation, death, madness and loss. In this album you can hear the uncanny musings of a man looking at 60's L.A. as the hippie dream implodes on the hot pavement. The only band in that era to match Love's penchant for dark and foreboding subjects was fellow L.A. musicians the Doors with whom you can hear many similiarities. Elektra signed both bands but the Doors would be the band to sky rocket to fame and fortune as Love would continue to only tour within L.A. and only then at their own convenience. When this album was recorded Lee and the band were so heavily addicted to heroin that many thought this record would never be cut due to the lack of intrest the band showed. However once recording began and Love saw other session musicians sitting in for them the band kicked into gear and Forever Changes was born. The mostly acoustic psychedelia is highlighted by lush string arrangements as well as an impressive brass section on some tracks. This deluxe remastered Rhino edition of this classic is essential in any rock album collection. It offers up outtakes and bonus tracks and extensive liner notes. A great way to rediscover a lost masterpiece.

B00005JN0T|1.0|This sucks really badly.                            <br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! <br />it has will Smith in it. Enough said. <br />But, saying that I haven't explained yet. <br />He has ears that are on the same scale to Tom Cruise's nose, and my pal AJ\\"Jizzy B\\" 's enormous girth. I said to AJ \\"Dude! Sweet! Dude! I wonder if we can get satellite T.V. for free if we splice a wire into those things?\\" He reckoned we could, so we did, but the wire was really short, so that's why he looks so angry on the cover of the DVD, cos he's dragging the wall of my house round with him, but he can't figure out what's going on ; he's like: \\"Dude, why's that wall following me around? That must have been one bad trip.\\" <br />  So the film sucks as it cost me a wall of a house, which promptly fell down, and also you can't see half the cast cos of Smith's ears, but it got one star as I got free satellite T.V.!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|Until I heard the album Aenima, I had never heard a band with so much emotion, anger, and beauty. This album is a perfect exampleof all of that. With Danny's pounding drum beats, Adam's heavily distorted guitars, and Maynard's beautiful yet powerful voice, this is definitely a band for the masses. Even though Aenima is a perfect example of all of their abilities as musical geniuses, I would reccomend all of their c.d's so that you're not missing out on all of their true talent.
0385504209|4.0|I started out being somewhat sceptical about this book.<br /><br />Certainly, a number of friends had recommended it. But<br /><br />that was in stark contrast to some critical newspaper reviews.<br /><br />So all in all I didn't expect much.<br /><br />  And then the book turned out to be better than expected. It is rich in cultural insights far beyond what you would ever expect in an average crimestory - Actually, you could read this book as an alternative underground crash course in christianity and western culture - All the stuff that have been filtered out, and you weren't supposed to hear about.<br /><br />  The critics condemn this novel for mixing truth with half truths and complete fiction, without giving it credit for being a good flight of fancy. It all seems a bit authoritarian to me. Remember that novels are supposed to tell stories that just might me true, not stories that are 100 percent certainly true?<br /><br />  Surely, there are inaccuracies in the book.<br /><br />E.g. there are NOT 666 windows in the pyramid at Louvre.<br /><br />But - Hey! this is a work of fiction! remember!?<br /><br />  Obviously, the book will inevitable end up as a movie, but read the book first!<br /><br />-Simon
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This is what can happen when you get one of the best musicians in the world playing arrangmements made by the original composer. Morricone's music has always been high on my list but it usually wasn't recorded very well or by the right people; not the case here. The golden tone of the Roma Sinfonietta  and Yo Yo Ma's haunting and straining cello bring every little detail from the music. What impressed me the most about this recording is how well the orchestra and soloist exchange and hand off material, playing in unison or counterpoint to each other they sound as one, as if Yo Yo Ma was the principal cello of the orchestra.  <br /> <br />Morricone's music is absolutely wonderful, this is one of those cd's you can just put in and let run cause all of the tracks are wonderful. My favorites are the first two tracks, from The Mission, and The Ecstasy of Gold which is probably the best arrangement on the cd. I can't think of anyone that wouldn't love this recording, the music is timeless and the quality of playing can be appreciated by anyone.
076790592X|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! I read this book in one sitting, which I almost never do; I could not put it down. This book is so profound and inspirational and know it is a book that has had an impact on my life. If we all could be a little bit more like Morrie, this world would be a wonderful place. This is a must read, but be sure to have some tissue close by because more than likely you will cry.  <br />
0312263120|1.0|The author says it's Spain, Europe. I think that even him can't believe what he is writting about. The research is very poor. Spain - Europe, is nothing at all as the author says it is. I think he is more likely writting about a banana republic. One of the worst book I've ever try to read.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIES, SECOND ONLY BEHIND THE CARTOON VERSION OF COURSE, OF 101 DALMATIANS. THE SONGS ARE GREAT, I LOVE DICK VAN DYKE, AND JULIE ANDREWS, AND THE REST OF THE CAST. JUST A PHENOMINAL MOVIE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. I ASKED FOR THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION FOR CHRISTMAS, AND IF I DON'T GET IT, I'LL GO OUT AND BUY IT MYSELF THE NEXT DAY. A TREMENDOUS MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO ENJOY! HIGHLY RECOMENDED.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I toyed with several titles, based on the overall quality of the film, as well as the subject matter: \\"Driving Mr. Crazy\\" because of Vincent's sociopathic nature, \\"Cabbies, Beware! The Next Fare May Be Your Last,\\" or \\"Blonds DO HAVE more fun,\\" in reference to Cruise's hair in the film.<br /><br />However, when I think about the total package, I could only see a film of which Sir Alfred would give his seal of approval. Like \\"Strangers on a Train,\\" \\"Collateral\\" bonds two men from different worlds together, one unaware that he is about to be the \\"accomplice\\" in the other's night of murder for hire. Hitchcock in \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" and \\"North by Northwest\\" did the aspect of the innocent man drawn into a world of intrigue and crime. Mann casts Foxx as the innocent and the director draws brilliant performances from both actors as they \\"play\\" off each other like old friends.<br /><br />Also, Mann, like Alfred, understands how the look is essential to the success of the film. The movie's setting, Los Angeles, takes on a part of its own, simultaneously looking both menacing and captivating. Only San Francisco in Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo\\" looked more alluring.<br /><br />The score by James Newton Howard, as well as the use of popular songs, is another fine element that Mann incorporates in this engaging thriller. Hitchcock, too, relied on music to tell his stories.<br /><br />The second disc features a fascinating \\"Making of...\\" documentary wherein the viewer gets an in-depth look at the very meticulous Mr. Mann.<br /><br />I would love to see Cruise, Foxx, and Pinkett-Smith in another film together, helmed by Michael Mann. Maybe, they can do a remake of \\"North by Northwest\\", with Cruise in the James Mason role, Foxx as Cary Grant's character, and Pinkett-Smith as the cool \\"blonde\\" played by Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />Hey, it's just a thought!
B0006399FS|2.0|I have been a fan of U2 for 25 years.  I think they peaked in the late 80's and early 90's.  I tried hard to have an open mind with this album but it is so disconnected.  I kept listening for the passion and power of the music they used to play but they'd kind of get rolling and then Bono would come in with off tone lyrics that never got in synch with Edge.  I got excited a few times during the album,  the song \\"All because of you\\" started to really go and then once again, Bono hosed it up....gggrrrr   It is like when Sammy Hagar joined Van Halen,  Eddy Van Halen would play one thing while Sammy sang something completely different than what the guitar was playing.  I thought about if I am just missing something so I went back to listening to \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" and even \\"Pop\\" and \\"Zooropa\\"  I wasn't missing anything, there is no comparison, those albums are light years better and have much more energy than this refuse. This is almost a \\"Pull out of the CD player and smash\\" album but I'll listen a couple of more times.    EDIT:  After listening to this album for over a month, I consider it my \\"Old U2 appreciation album\\"  This album is such a hodge podge of noise that it makes listening to the older U2 (Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, Pop, Greatest Hits 80's and 90's) that much more enjoyable.  In my opinion, U2 was at the peak of the bell curve in the mid to late 80's and has been going down the back side ever since.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|As one of those people who cannot stand to listen to non-stop christmas music from September to January, or even for a couple of hours at a holiday concert, I rarely even look at christmas albums unless I'm shopping for someone who's specifically requested one.  This one caught my eye, though, and I figured if anyone could make christmas music bearable, it would be Jethro Tull.  Boy, am I glad I bought it!  Jethro Tull makes this not just bearable, but enjoyable.  This might be my favorite christmas present this year.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|A seemingly unique album for 2004, maybe less so for 1980 but a recent standout nonetheless. Instrumentation is its high point. Along with a gauzy, rrrumbly production the mutlitude of instruments and their often percussively melodic sounds transmit a unique blend of emotion, both joyous and a little sad all at once. The lead singer's delivery and lyrics are a very near match to the motions of the instruments, so the album presents a cohesive and memorable listening experience, which at times will likely make you want to jump up and move about a bit! The one drawback is the chord structures can tend to sound as if they were plunked out on two fingers on the piano and then the instrumentation added on top. At times this works brilliantly, ala 1980!, but it also presents a sneaking suspicion that with all of the fine instrumentation some of the songwriting tasks should be shared around a bit. I'm curious to see whether their next album improves in this respect. I would think that if it doesn't this band will be known for posterity for this one wonderful album. Thanks for reading.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is my favorite Disney movie of all time. The animation is breathtaking as it is a sweet & tender story. This Disney movie stands out above all of the other's. It takes a classic fairy tale and makes it a whole new story. The musical numbers such as: Beauty and The Beast, Be Our Guest, Belle, & much more will make you feel like your at a Broadway Musical, which in addition it's no wonder it did very well on Broadway itself. The voices are extremely talented and make you take a loving interest in the characters even the villains. Everyone knows this story already; however, everyone needs to see and experience this Disney classic. It's again my favorite among them all.    The DVD is truly amazing of course. My favorites include: Beauty and the Beast music video with an introduction from my favorite singer Celine Dion, all of the games which the kids will enjoy, & the behind the scene's. The most enjoyable was the new addition to the movie Human Again which was put on the cutting room floor in the original theatrical version.    This is an instantly beautiful treasure to add to your Disney collection or DVD collection. It's also a film that the entire family will enjoy in it's timeless masterpiece.
B00062ZE44|5.0|With \\"The Silent Force\\", WT scores a direct hit, capable of satisfying fans in all backgrounds without coming across as shallow or \\"watered down\\". Silent Force contains the trademark WT angelic vocals, but with far more organic and original symphonic orchestration and backing choirs than any of their previous works, following a widening trend in the wake of other \\"operatic\\" female vocal-fronted bands like Nightwish, Epica, or Octavia. (Though not to say WT are pretenders to the throne and playing copycat. They were one of the original pioneers of this sound many years ago, and have matured and refined this sound to the present magnum opus of The Silent Force.)<br /><br />The Silent Force is anything but silent, and the album envelops you into a very rich and textured musical environment, weaving Sharon's beautiful vocals into a tapestry of crunchy guitars and lush orchestration. The chorus and anthems are epic, the softer songs are tender and moving, and the heavy parts just plain rock. This album has something for a wide range of music fans: from Evanescence-type music fans, to Gothic metal fans, to those who prefer \\"intelligent\\" symphonic music, or who are just looking for something different than the usual top 40 pop-tart music.<br /><br />The first single released from this album, Stand My Ground, was purely designed to be a single, and sticks out from the rest of the songs on the CD. It is not stylistically representative of the rest of the songs on the album though by itself it is pretty enjoyable to listen to. Though some fans have cried foul and \\"sellout\\" when hearing this track on the radio (and I admit that when I first heard the single on the radio, I got worried that the new album would be entirely like Stand My Ground) it serves to give WT a foothold on the cookie-cutter radio and TV stations, which I have little problem with.<br /><br />Stand out tracks that immediately captivate the listener and run through one's mind long after the CD has been turned off are Jilian (an orchestrated and epic metal anthem), Memories, Forsaken, See Who I Am, and It's The Fear (catchy chorus, probably a good choice for the second single).<br /><br />All songs on this album are good, and the long wait after WT's last album was sure worth the wait.

6303257844|4.0|If you enjoy plenty of action then this is your film. The storyline is farfetched which is the reason that I gave the movie 4 stars. If the storyline had been more believeable then the film would have earned 5 stars. The bottom line is that you watch the movie for the action sequences. As in any action film the bigger screen is better.
B000003TA4|3.0|very=punk influenced songs. If ur into punk u should definitly get this. guitar fanatics should stay away.  cobain cant really sing but he can scream in tune. nothin but power chords, and solos mimicking the vocal parts. Sad that cobain killed himself, but i don't think ne 1 would disagree with the fact that they are the most overrated band of all time. high point in this album is the drumming. i would reccomend Alice in Chains' facelift as an alternate album. its very melodic and rocks MUCH MUCH harder
B00069YDXU|4.0|This DVD features Emerson, Lake and Palmer far from being at their popularity peak, but this his really something I dont mind.  First of all, the songs selection his faboulous, this is really THE best thing, they played things from different era, but focussing on their early materials.  They nailed every songs perfectly.  Maybe they are getting old, but they still give a fabulous show(i know its 1997, but i consider this today), Keith Emerson still masters his instruments, Greg Lake has a big and deep voice wich i found was different and Carl Palmer is still a machine with is drumm solo too.  <BR>Only bad thing is the quality...it kinda suck, there is DTS and 5.1, but im having trouble finding a good sound(the drumm is bizarely recorded) and the video quality is rather cheap.<BR>But the show is so captivating that you soon forget those bad sides and you enjoy the performance.
B000001FSU|3.0|As much as I love Anthrax, it pains me to give this album a mere three stars, but dammit, it just doesn't deserve anything better than that.  It's really kinda a shock how flawed this album is, considering how absolutely great the 2 albums just before it, and the 1 after it were, but it's definitely got some major problems, and is not in the same league as those other albums.  Well actually, it's got one major problem, which is enough to cripple the album: the vocals are TERRIBLE.  Joey is definitely off his game here, and he doesn't sound himself, but that's not the real problem.  The real problem is that they came up with an absolutely wretched batch of vocal lines.  Simply put, every song here except 'Be All, End All' and 'Antisocial' has at least one very prominent and very grating vocal line.(and plenty of them have more than that)  The examples are endless: 'Don't think about anything' pretty much all of 'Make me Laugh', 'Your Mama's calling you' the verses to 'Now it's Dark' the chorus to 'Schism', and so on.  The obnoxious vocals are particularly upsetting as they often result in a very grating, obnoxious chorus. Vox typically don't matter that much in thrash, so you can sometimes overlook them, but they were always more imporant in Anthrax's work, and much of the work here is just to irritating to be ignored.<br /><br />This is particularly sad, because most other aspects of this album are pretty good, if not necessarily up to Anthrax's standards.  'Be All, End All' and 'Antisocial' are both great songs.  Very catchy and melodic yet still very crunchy and intense.  Thus, they're just classic Anthrax.(though 'Antisocial' is a cover, of course).  And, the riffwork on this album is pretty solid.  Not as good as Anthrax's other stuff, though.  It's sorta a transitional album, so the riffs have lost some of the melodicism and bounciness you'd find in older Anthrax, but haven't yet got the full intensity, variety and complexity that you'd find on 'Persistence of Time'.  But they're still pretty good, and could've made a very good thrash album.  Charlie gives a nice performance too, as always.  He's always been just about the most energetic, most propulsive drummer around, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Still, they can't overcome the very rarely inspired, often irritating vocals.<br /><br />Also, it has just about the most hideous cover art imaginable.<br /><br />This album is still somewhat enjoyable, as evinced by my 3 star rating, but it definitely isn't truly mandatory for either the thrash fan in general, or the Anthrax fan in particular.But they're still pretty good, and could've made a very good thrash album.

B00005JN0T|4.0|What made the original Katherine Ross \\"Stepford Wives\\" so chilling was the feeling like it could happen. Just suppose the world is a little, not a lot, more surprising than you think it is, and that could happen. That movie has enduring quality. The Nicole Kidman remake of \\"Stepford Wives\\" is played as tongue-in-cheek and it's not scary and it's not even any good.<br /><br />Will Smith gets better every year. He msde this splendid movie \\"I, Robot\\" happen. He's a fine actor but a better producer, and to him we owe gratitude for advancing the literature of the cinema. It's a great movie, and conceptually profound. We \\"intelligent\\" wet-brained primates construct a marvelous apparatus, with unexpected capabilities and implications, that gives new scope to our emotions. It joins classics \\"Pinocchio\\", \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Forbidden Planet\\" and others, exploring that familiar theme from a previously little seen aspect.<br /><br />But oh... the fatal flaw... The \\"action\\" scenes just aren't believable. Dozens of robots attacked Spooner repeatedly. He shot and ruined them all with the endless ammunitiion from his gun. And then there was the Evel-Knievel scene with the motorcycle in the air. All that stupidity would better have been left on the cutting room floor. What's the point? Creating a few screenshots for the \\"I, Robot\\" video game? It's like putting a Formica surface on a Marie Antoinette dressing table. It will cost \\"I, Robot\\" an Oscar.<br /><br />Will, I love you anyway, but sorry. You may be remembered eternally for what history may yet judge as a cinematic masterpiece. You may join the pantheon with Steven Speilberg, Howard Hawks, Ridley Scott, John Ford, David Lean, George Lucas. But I think it more likely the consensus will rank this movie slightly lower than a Guy Hamilton 007 flick.<br /><br />Imagine if Spooner had just been portrayed as something a real human might possibly be. The plot could have had him personally and luckily defeat two, or maybe even three robots. Then we could have believed that, if the world had a little more surprise than we might have expected, the  story of the movie might some day come true. It would have chilled us to the bone. It could have started a political movement of neo-Luddites. It could have landmarked a new age of cinema, and Will Smith would be remembered forever.<br /><br />Will, I'm looking forward to your next opus.hree robots.

The brendan o'brien remixes on the \\"ten\\" stuff are fantastic and the remastering job on these CD's are remarkable. i'd like to see Brendan remix the entire Ten album just to see how it would sound.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Rice's voice literally penetrated my soul when I first heard Blower's Daughter in the film Closer. I had to hear it again. When my CD arrived, I literally listened to the entire thing for 7 hours straight. Rice is a rare find. His artistry in O soars far beyond most debut albums. The depth of his lyrics, which reminisce of life and love, reminds you of what it means to bleed for someone's love. Cannonball, Older Chests and Amie are wonderful pieces. The whole album is priceless. Please buy this!
0676974120|5.0|I have read all Nigella's books (with the exception of Forever Summer) and have found them both helpful reference books and fascinating reading.<br />Feast is a book about celebration, abundance, and communion in the literal sense of the word, after all, what is a feast without people?  Nigella amply displays her giving nature, her fixation with giving to others the thing which gives her so much pleasure...food.  At the same time she clearly demonstrates her selfish and culinary dark side by admiting to solitary feasts (or indeed a deux) in the bedroom and one can only be amused at such an admission.<br />This book is about the richness of life, decadence, indulgence almost epicurianism, evocative of bygone traditions, it isn't for the health concious nor for vegetarians as previously pointed out.  I agree with Nigella on this one...given the abundance of wonderful vegetables and diversity of their flavours and textures, why try and make them into &quot;meat substitutes&quot; by fiddling and sprauncing?  Nigella is by no means &quot;anti-vegetarian&quot; and evidently understands that some of her guests will not want to eat meat, so, let them eat vegetables since her groaningly overfilled table will clearly contain an abundance of these.<br />Nigella is obviously about richness and not for the low fat cook, however, I have never known anyone not to be able to make a lower fat version of anything, unless they are trying to be difficult.  Personally (and I shall probably be shot down in flames by some for this) I have never yet seen a low fat vegetarian FEAST.<br />I love this book and recommend it as both a helpful kitchen aid and wonderful bedside reading.

The Matrix Trilogy shamelessly takes many elements from Dark City, like the phone call at the begining of the movie, and a character who gets clues regarding a reality that may not be quite \\"real\\", the wardrobe of the strangers that rule Dark City (Trinity's clothes) , the main character's ability to \\"tune\\" or use his mind to move, destroy things, the scene where they come to get the main character but he leaves in the nick of time, the final battle above the city, the fact that no one in the city is aware that things aren't quite like they seem to be, the back doors that appear and disappear, the actual shape and design of the beings that inhabit the Strangers (the \\"bug\\" the agent puts into Neo's stomach), the power of the beings to put everyone to sleep (a metaphor for the machines in the Matrix that keep humanity in a state of permanent \\"sleep\\"), the way the buildings rise from below twisting and forming at the same time (the giantic drills in Matrix Revolutions, when they \\"stand up\\" to become robots). And I could go on! I had watched this movie many years ago but it wasn't until I bought it last week, and saw it again that I remembered all the details and how the Matrix movies took so much from it. Dark City has no filler. It's never boring, and the director wasn't shy to gives us the good stuff early on. Like when Murdock, the main character, goes into a dinner and makes a display of his talents. <br />I have to say , I got I Robot, also directed by Alex Proyas, and Dark City is a better film by far. Yes the characters are flat, the story isn't very complicated, but it delivers in set design, mood, Jennifer Conelly (wow!), originality (can't say that for the Matrix trio) and it does have a secret twist at the very end, which gives us kind of a Butterfly Effect  (another great movie with Asthon Kutcher, where memories also play a crucial role) totally unespected.<br />
B000002U8G|5.0|Obviously Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish You Were Here are better albums, but the fact remains that if I listen to my classic rock radio station for a whole day I am likely hear every song from both of these albums.  So for this reason, Meddle is my favorite Floyd album. <br />   <br />But it is not perfect.  The album is a bit uneven, three classics, one good song, and two clunkers.  I'll start with the opener.  One of These Days (I'm Going to Cut You Into Little Pieces) is a classic.  With a propulsive bass line and a heavy guitar, this song starts the album off with a bang.  This is the most menacing and heavy Pink Floyd has ever sounded until they released The Wall.  A Pillow of Winds is a mellow song with light percussion that falls into the good category.  Fearless is the second classic song on the the album.  Great lyrics and a great melody.  San Tropez is...out of place.  It doesn't seem to fit into this album, and Seamus is kind of irritating.   <br /> <br />Last but not least is the signature Floyd space rock epic.  Better than Interstellar Overdrive and Brain Damage, Echoes is the quientisential Floyd song.  23 minutes of brillance.   <br /> <br />This album comes highly recommended.  If you don't have a radio and have never heard their other classics, then get those first, but this is very refreshing and very good.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I heard \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" on the radio a couple times and thought it was catchy enough to listen to the cd, but never did.  Then one day I saw the video... I was impressed that he played the piano.  I figured now was any time as good as any to give the cd a listen.  I honestly thought that he would be another artist with a good producer and hyped up lyrics... NO!  I can only describe his music as this:  if you like Maroon 5, you'll LOVE Gavin DeGraw.  In an industry with \\"entertainers\\", it's hard to find TRUE artists who write meaningful songs and play their own instruments.  This cd has earned a place alongside my Maroon 5, on constant rotation, in my cd player!  Gavin... What can I say?!
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is like my favruite band and there music is unique. when you hear it you get hooked it sounds like a lulaby. every time i hear there music i turn it up and start singing along and sometimes it puts me to sleep! so as you can see coldplay is a brilliant band and chris has the most soothing voice that puts alot of emotion in his songs when he sings.!so if you dont have this album GO &amp; GET IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I was introduced to Napoleon Dynamite by my friend who saw it last summer, and when it came to our movie theaters I went 3 times and laughed till I cried everytime.  It is an independant film, worth every cent, and pays attention to every little detail.  The bottom line is you'll either LOVE it or you'll hate it.  Any one between the ages of 14 and 30 will love it.  I found myself quoting it for months afterward.  Buy it.

I love the cd, and it is awsome, but I think at least one of the two songs mentioned above should've been included...
0375433074|4.0|I liked that this book wasn't about another \\"young lawyer\\" still wet behind the ears; I liked seeing Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex make another appearance.<br /><br />I thought it was good, and jaded as I am reading so many suspense novels, I didn't really have a clue as to who was the culprit at the end.  LOL<br /><br />I was happy with the book, was not disappointed at all.  Go John!
0316666343|4.0|Sebold knows how to get a reader's attention with the second sentence of her novel being: \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" So many authors fail to grab you even in the first two chapters let alone the first two sentences.<br /><br />Many reviewers have indicated that they found this novel to be sad or unsatisfying because of how Susie's murder is handled. I found neither to be the case. By making the dead girl the omniscient narrator we're soothed by the fact that she lives on and cares for her family even though they are unable to see her.<br /><br />Despite the magical qualities of heaven, Sebold is able to keep the book realistic by how she handles the murder. Sometimes things aren't as neat and tidy as we'd like. And sometimes we just have to get over it and move on. What happens to Susie's murderer and how the family deals with their lack of knowledge was one of the things that kept it from being a boilerplate genre fluff piece. In the real world you don't get absolute justice and absolute resolution.<br /><br /> While I enjoyed \\"Bones\\" immensely, especially on Sebold's combination of fantasy and emotional realism, I had a problem with her perspective on crime in general.<br /><br />In her memior \\"Lucky\\" she writes of being raped in a way similar to how Susie is attacked. It doesn't seem to be a great leap to suggest that she borrowed from her own life to write this novel. This is certainly not a bad thing. However, it seems that her experience has clouded her perspective.<br /><br />Throughout the novel Ruth is able to see where girls and women have been raped and killed. At no time is she aware of crimes against males. Only women. I didn't count, but it seemed that references to crimes against women - and only women - was contained in at least half a dozen passages, perhaps even more.<br /><br />If this were a novel without fantasy this might be excused because Sebold could simply present us with a character, for example, who works ata women's shelter and meets victims on a daily basis. But the fantastic abilities of the characters in this book, Susie and Ruth specifically, open up the whole world. It makes no sense to have person with the ability see people's deaths after they've occurred to filter out images according to the victim's sex. But that's exactly what Sebold does do.<br /><br />Sebold's blind spot, conceivably created by her own horrific experience, doesn't break the novel. But for me it certainly tainted its positive message. As a pro-feminist male I found it annoying, as if the author had an ax to grind, to read passages that seemed like they were written by a young and naive college student who can't distinguish between her facts. It's obvious that females constitute the vast majority of rape victims. (It's hard to know the exact figures when males, typically raped as children, hide their experiences.) However, general male on male violence is by far more prevalent than male on female. So there needs to be balance. All Sebold had to do was have Ruth's character able to see all crime victims.<br /><br />Because of this blind spot, I can't give the book five stars.
B000000OQF|5.0|Axl has been around in the LA music scene since the mid 80s but \\"Appetite\\" propelled them to a stature that the GnR members themselves had never conceived even in their wildest dreams.  <br /> <br />Musically I like a lot of genres including hard rock and my interest spans from music from the 50s to a few of the ones playing today.  But I should say that I would rate this album as one of the 5 best of all time in rock music history.  <br /> <br />The painful childhood of Axl manifests itself in the rage and angst that he spouts in every song and believe me, you can feel it in your nerves! From start to finish there is no song that I would say is a filler. GnR gave everything they had to this album and I feel like I am riding a steep roller coaster, the moment I start spinning this CD in my player. Obviously they would never be able to match the stupendous success of this album in their ensuing musical endeavors.  But\\"Appetite\\" stands testimony for how talented Axl and company where and that their histrionics were in no way a cover up for their lack of ability.  Album sales of course cannot be used as a basis for judging its quality, but this is one truly great work where its umpteen million sales is justified.  <br /> <br />Don't walk, run to the store!! <br />
B0002XL35G|5.0|Wim Wenders' remarkable film is preserved in a wonderful widescreen format. Special features include commentary from Wenders, deleted scenes, and a short film depicting the actors making an entry into Cannes, where the film won top honors in the early 80s.   Harry Dean Stanton's Travis wanders on foot through southern Texas and Mexico for four years following a devastating breakup with his wife Jane.  Jane, at one time a wild spirit who sought a life of adventure, leaves their son, Hunter, with Travis' brother and sister-in-law.  The film depicts Travis' return from his emotional abyss and his attempts to reunite his family.  This is a story of guilt, remorse, and loneliness, which confronts honestly the complexities facing a shattered family.
B000002UB3|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan, but I'm the first one to admit that their albums always have one or two songs that drag it down.  Even Sgt. Pepper, their masterpiece, has the song Getting Better, which I feel is pretty far off the mark compared to the rest of the album. <br /> <br />Yet that rule doesn't seem to apply here.  There's just so much to love on this album that I can't express it in words.  Every song fits perfectly with the album, and the voices work really well.  I could go on for hours, but I like to keep reviews short and simple.  In conclusion, BUY THIS.  You won't be disappointed.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I came at this film from a non-Christian perspective in that I think the events portrayed either never happened or were so distorted by those who wrote the Gospels that they beared no resemblance to history.  That meant I couldn't respond to the guilt trip Mel Gibson meant to put on everyone about how Jesus  suffered for everyone's sins, so I looked at it as just a movie. A very boring movie. <br /> <br />First the good parts. I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film, which featured some good filter effects (the garden scenes) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have. I also liked Maia Morgenstern's performance as Mary. She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain. The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots, especially from the mountains. I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good. <br /> <br />Those weren't enough to make this a good movie for me though. The beatings grew boring very quickly, which made the final half of the film very tedious for me. Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures, portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes, the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob. James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role, but I didn't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting. The scenes with the Satan character didn't work for me at all.  <br /> <br />There was also the problem that, if you weren't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology, this movie would have made no sense at all. I guess to Gibson this wasn't a problem, since he was making this film for a specific audience. That audience made him a lot of money, so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook. That does not make this a great movie though. (As far as the anti-Semitic question, I agree that this film qualified. The Jews suffered for centuries because of the \\"Christ Killer\\" label, and this movie echoed that belief. The Romans may have did the killing, but the Jews started the ball rolling, a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly. Like father, like son.) <br />

B000056H24|4.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told can be difficult to approach.  It is long, dated and controversial, and it deals with that most sensitive of topics, the life of Jesus.  When I first saw this film more than 20 years ago I confess I wrote it off as another Hollywood epic flop which attempted to capitalize on the dramatic biblical material for commercial reasons.  Now having taken in the film again recently I can happily say that I was mostly wrong.  This film has many merits. <br /> <br />First, Hollywood legend George Stevens (Gunga Din, Shane, Diary of Anne Frank) made the film with a reverent attitude toward Jesus and the Bible.  The film lacks the immediacy of Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth or the power of Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, but upon my reviewing of the film I was surprised how sincerely Stevens approached the Christian material.  I was impressed that this was no mere intellectual or commercial enterprise.  Despite this being the last of the biblical epics to be commericially released from Hollywood, this film is indeed about faith.  Some have found the film somewhat ambivalent in its attitude toward the religious material, but there is no doubting Steven's genuine expression of faith. <br /> <br />Second, Loyal Griggs' cinematography is often breathtaking.  The Holy Land gets the same glorious treatment as David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, but in this film the landscape is put to religious purpose with beautiful effect.  Some have found the locations in the American Southwest to be distracting, but I find them to be more dramatic and spiritually evocative than most of the films coming from the Bible lands.  The Colorado River is far more imposing than that actual Jordan as a setting for John the Baptist's work, but what is lost in escaping the more mundane historical locale is more than made up for in the dramatic and spiritually evocative Southwest landscape.  Quite simply, the landscape in this film is more beautiful than any other biblical epic.Many of the interior scenes are dramatically side lit, like a late Renaissance Italian Master painting, with many technically staged scenes beautifully shot in the style of the time (the last suppor with a candle light halo behind Jesus, the trials of Jesus before beefy Pilate (Telly Salvalas in red and leather), the woman caught in adultry dressed in striking red).  The movie still looks surprisingly good, even if we have grown to see the once daring look of Technicolor as dated and unnatural. <br /> <br />Third, Alfred Newman's quite modern score effectively alternates between late Romantic poignancy and modern, even minimalist, insights.  Stevens also wisely allows long silences to speak for themselves, as though the film goer were witnessing the events with the same sense of wonder and lack of a score as the witnesses in the film. <br /> <br />Fourth, there are many fine performances by Hollywood legends in unusual roles.  Claude Rains as Herod the Great and Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas are particularly strong, and Charlton Heston almost steals the show as John the Baptist in a powerful performance, which, despite a few heavy-handed scenes, is far more compelling than his work as Moses or Ben Hur. <br /> <br />So why has the film received such controversial notices, both at the time of its original release in 1965 and from viewers today? <br /> <br />The film has a strangely modern feel and attitude toward Jesus.  Max von Sydow as the Christ is at times oracular and powerful, but at other times fails to connect with the viewer or appeal to the viewer's sympathies.  Perhaps it is baggage from von Sydow's persona as the existential hero of Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal that distracts; I confess I keep trying to reconcile the images of Bergman's masterpiece, which is powerfully anti-catholic, with this more reverent von Sydow.  Perhaps it is the omission of certain supernatural elements from the biblical text which are rather obviously avoided in Stevens' film,like omitting the voice and dove from heaven at Jesus' baptism or the refusal to look the rising Lazarus in the face.  The latter event is shown not through a close up of the risen dead man but through the incredulous responses of the witnesses, leading the viewer to suspect that Stevens may view the \\"miracle\\" as a subjective interpretation of the witnesses rather than a historical fact.  Nonetheless, the sincerity of Stevens' faithful attitude toward the subject is rescued as the witnesses proclaim the coming of the Messiah (to the sounds of Handel's Hallelujah chorus, no less!).  But even this last bit of Hollywood kitsch comes off well in the film.  In the final analysis, I believe that that the modernism of the film is one of style and not of philosophy, and that Stevens meant to tell the supernatural story in a language which would be readily understood by modern hearers. <br /> <br />The movie is long:  195 minutes, or 3 hours and 15 minutes.  Many readers have complained of this fact, but I see it as a virtue.  Stevens simply refuses to hurry.  There is a magisterial pace to the production which bored me 25 years ago but which I find appropriate and reverent now.  In fact, given the scope of the events in the film, I almost feel that we see too little of Jesus' three years of ministry, leaving us too little opportunity to be taken by his message and personality.  Enough said:  This is not a movie for someone who is looking for two hours of entertainment. It is a serious film with a serious approach to a sacred subject matter.  Approach it this way or you will simply waste your time. <br /> <br />Some critisize the scores of Hollywood stars as a distraction.  But while a few castings fail, like John Wayne as a Centurian, they seldom distract, and many are outstanding.  The stars are one of the great attractions to this film, not for their star power but for the surprising depth of their performances. <br /> <br />The film also takes licenses with the biblicaltext.  For those of us who hold the text sacred, authoritative and cannonical, this presents some problems.  Sometimes the supernatural is avoided (see Jesus' baptism above), sometimes the chronology or setting are altered (Jesus is approached by the first disciples in Judea, rather than calling them in Galilee), and sometimes the biblical text is merely restated with additional dialogue to fit the needs of a scene.  At times the quality of the screen writing compares laughably with the familiar Bible verses which precede or follow it, but generally the changes do little to alter the fundamental meaning of the texts.  Though it is disconcerting to hear biblical quotes out of context or set them side by side with a screen play, none of the quotes struck me as fundamentally untrue or unbiblical.  While it is dangerous business to use scripture without strict adherence to the biblical text and context, the film is little different than some of the looser paraphrase Bibles which are popular today.  One could hardly expect to treat the subject of Jesus Christ in the modern medium of film based solely on the literary approaches of the Gospel writers, even though they were inspired.  Film is quite simply a different medium.  The changes do distract me and it is far safer to make every effort to stay strictly within the biblical text when approaching Jesus on film, but the variations in this film are minor and, upon 25 years further reflection, cannot be said to be wholesale affronts to the Biblical message. <br /> <br />In the end, Jesus does rise from the dead, with much lightening and purple-clouded drama.  The supernatural is affirmed.  Von Sydow plays the God-Man after all, rather than Bergman's existentialist Black Knight.  In the end, the film is a commendable picture of the life of Jesus, but it needs to be understood in context.  First, it is sincere.  Second, it is beautiful in the best way that studio Hollywood knew how to make it.  Third, despite its modern look and feel, in the end it is an expression of faith, despite some minor licenses taken with the biblical text.  The film is worth seeing if you keep in mind that it is a document of mid-20th Century American film making and mid-20th Century American Christianity.  Though it looks and feels modern, there is a genuine faith behind the film.  It will not wow post-Evangelical Christians either with its power or with its relationship to the Bible, but the film does not threaten either.  It is not to be seen merely for entertainment.  It is too long and too serious for that.  But George Stevens' last film now appears to be one of his best.  He believed sincerly in this film, and contemporary viewers may as well.

In an interesting move, the Wachowski brothers have divided them into pro and con sides. The pro is represented by philosophers Dr. Cornel West and Ken Wilber. The con is represented by a trio of film critics, Variety's Todd McCarthy, Vogue's John Powers and film historian David Thomson.<br /><br />After awhile, the prevailing attitude of a lot of the extras on these discs is that of an over-confident sports team as opposed to the familial, humble vibe of The Lord of the Rings crew.<br /><br />The Matrix Revisited traces the film's humble origins from an idea that the Wachowski brothers had for a comic book to the screenplay that they ended up writing to the film that they made to the legacy that now exists.<br /><br />Some of the highlights of The Matrix Reloaded Revisited include a detailed look at how the exciting freeway chase sequence was filmed.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|It's wonderful to have Mary Poppins on dvd.  I haven't seen it in years but it's just as great as when I first saw it in the movies as a ten year old.  Every child should be made to watch this movie.  It's about more than children needing a nanny.  It's about the family as a whole.  The kids don't need a nanny to be happy.  They just need their mom and dad.  This is one of the all time Disney great movies.  It's a great family picture.  No car chases, bombs, sex, cursing, nudity, rap music, miniskirts, etc.     This dvd is well worth having.  There are so many extras that they are longer than the movie.  I've been up for hours trying to see everything but I gave up.  I'll have to see the rest of it tomorrow.  Interviews, the premier, out takes, behind the scenes, after party, red carpet, star interviews after the movies, deleted songs, plus much, much, more.     Mary Poppins looks great on dvd.  The images are sharp and clear.  Please don't miss this one.  Make sure you see it with your children.  Pass it down to the next generation.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|After the commercial failure and mixed critical reaction to the vastly underrated Ali, Michael Mann returns to familiar territory-the urban crime thriller-with Collateral. Coming off three grandiose epics in a row, the veteran filmmaker shifts gears with this lean, no-nonsense movie that harkens back to early films in his career like, Thief. Like the late Stanley Kubrick (of whom Mann is sometimes compared to), Mann has tried repeatedly to breakthrough to a mainstream audience. It would make sense then that he would cast Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise as one of the main protagonists. If there were any actor on the planet that could guarantee a sure-fire hit at the box office it would be Cruise. However, Mann throws a potential spanner in the works by casting the actor as an amoral hit man. Would this scare off a mainstream audience?<br /><br />The first disc features an informative audio commentary track by director Michael Mann. The veteran filmmaker really did his homework as he talks about the realistic details used in the background of scenes and with various characters. He also talks at length about the characters' backstories and motivations.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with \\"City of Night: The Making of Collateral,\\" a 41-minute look at how this film came together and was made. There is also footage of Tom Cruise training with a weapons expert so that he could credibly portray a professional assassin on screen. This is a step up above the usual electronic press kit material.<br /><br />\\"Special Delivery\\" takes a look at some of the research Cruise did for this role. In order to get into character, Mann disguised the actor as FedEx delivery man and had him deliver a package to a business in a crowded place and not get recognized. Included is actual footage of Cruise in action.<br /><br />There is one deleted scene with commentary by Mann. It shows Vincent and Max going into LAX to lose the police and federal surveillance that is tracking them.<br /><br />\\"Shooting on Location: Annie's Office\\" examines the use of high-definition digital video used to capture Vincent stalking Annie in her darkened office at night. It is a scene that would have been impossible to render on traditional film.<br /><br />\\"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse\\" gives a glimpse into the creative process as we see footage of the two actors reading through a scene in Mann's office, juxtaposed with the final scene in the movie.<br /><br />\\"Visual FX: MTA Train\\" shows how Mann used a green screen effect on the climatic sequence on the train so that he could customize the backgrounds to suit his vision.<br /><br />Finally, there are cast and crew biographies and extensive production notes.<br /><br />Collateral is a fitting addition to Michael Mann's distinctive filmography. It continues his thematic pre-occupations of isolated protagonists who have little time for personal relationships. It is also deals with another Mann obsession: transformation. In order to have any chance of surviving the night with Vincent, Max must change from being a passive character to one that takes an active role in determining his own fate. It is the exploration of such weighty themes, coupled with Mann's distinctive style that elevates Collateral from its generic conventions.<br /> <br />\\"Shooting on Location: Annie's Office\\" examines the use of high-definition digital video used to capture Vincent stalking Annie in her darkened office at night. It is a scene that would have been impossible to render on traditional film. <br /> <br />\\"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse\\" gives a glimpse into the creative process as we see footage of the two actors reading through a scene in Mann's office, juxtaposed with the final scene in the movie. <br /> <br />\\"Visual FX: MTA Train\\" shows how Mann used a green screen effect on the climatic sequence on the train so that he could customize the backgrounds to suit his vision. <br /> <br />Finally, there are cast and crew biographies and extensive production notes. <br /> <br />Collateral is a fitting addition to Michael Mann's distinctive filmography. It continues his thematic pre-occupations of isolated protagonists who have little time for personal relationships. It is also deals with another Mann obsession: transformation. In order to have any chance of surviving the night with Vincent, Max must change from being a passive character to one that takes an active role in determining his own fate. It is the exploration of such weighty themes, coupled with Mann's distinctive style that elevates Collateral from its generic conventions.
B000002KB8|5.0|I have always been for the longest time a lover of old rock.  That is personally all I own.  Black Sabbath is one of my all time favorites, right up there with the Lords of heavy metal Led Zeppelin.  And yes I said Lords of heavy metal.  Many people think that black sabbath started heavy metal, they only increased it.  There was nobody out at the time led zeppelin started that was as heavy or heavier.  An encarta encyclopedia will tell you that.  Anyway this album is an awesome debut, all the songs are great.  They are a bit dark, but thats black sabbath.
B000002U8G|5.0|Even though the version of Echoes on here is breathtaking (and the main reason I say it's the best Floyd album), my favorite version is the live one from the Pompeii concert.  The guitars are heavier and the harmonies are punchier.  So, while I absolutely recommend buying this album, be sure to buy \\"Live At Pompeii\\" too. <br /> <br />By the way, the rest of the album is great too, especially Fearless and One Of These Days I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces

0793518326|5.0|This score is awesome.  There are some chord symbol mistakes.  Eb where it should be E and other such minor mistakes, but if used in combination with listening to original albums this book can be very helpful.   <br /> <br />Mistakes as I said, but this collection may not be revised for a very long time and as a musician and a composer I really appreciate this collection.

B0006399FS|4.0|First off, Yes, it's true this is not U2's best release.  But, it's good.  It's very good.  Everyone claims to be U2's biggest fan, but as a fan, you should realize that U2 is a constantly changing (and some would say evolving) band.  I too, grew up as a huge U2 fan.  The first concert I ever saw was for the Joshua Tree tour in 1987.  It blew my mind.   <br /> <br />Maybe why I like this release is because I didnt pop it in my player expecting to hear the Joshua Tree or Achtung, I expected to be entertained, somewhat challenged, and ultimately moved.  In many respects, I have felt all three.  Certain songs, such as \\"all because of you\\" probably could have been left off.  But, as a whole, Atomic Bomb ranks up there with many other U2 releases.   <br /> <br />As for Bono's voice, I completely disagree.  People try to use such technical words --- \\"his falcetto sounds so out of pitch\\"  Come on!  Bono's voice has ALWAYS been raspy.  Thats the beauty of it.  Were not talking about opera here, it's rock and roll.  His voice is great, and it sounds strong throughout this disk.   <br /> <br />Bare in mind, the original CD tracks, which were completely different songs, were stolen at the 11th hour.  Much of this album was assembled under \\"less than desirable\\" circumstances.  Still, it's a solid disk.  Go back, listen to Miracle drug, crumbs from your table, Yahweh, and several others.  If it doesnt move you in the least bit, check your pulse.
020530902X|5.0|Nothing has helped my writing more than this little guide. I was introduced to it by a poetry professor my first year of college, and now it's nearly falling apart. The book is well organized, addressing common confusions over English usage (rules for punctuation, frequently confused words like which/that, etc.) and helpful hints for effective writing. Digesting this material will make your writing more coherent, more concise, and more powerful. It's also a cheap and useful gift to give to high school grads who are planning on going to college.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Forgetting about Madonna herself (what shes about an accomplised) Like A Virgin is hands down the #1 revolutionary, female/diva pop album of the 80s, and in my opinion \\"today\\"! What this album did for the female pop singer is what Elvis did for Rock N Roll. Every blow up, talentless barbie doll (since then) has tried to emulate the flawless success (sexiness, image, and pure pop perfection) of this album! No ones even remotely touched Like A Virgin. Britney came maybe within 1/8 of a mile, but her debut simply didnt stand the test of time in endless ways. Shes simply a one album wonder manufactured 200% and simply a puppet from corporate exces who blatantly had \\"Madonna\\" (and Like A Virgin) in mind with what they wanted to accomplish! Baby One More Time sold for sure, and had some decent, catchy songs but her albums/ singles after were pure cr*p, and shes simply a personality (again which the media tried to label the new generational/ younger Madonna), but LAV was a bullseye in every single way which was packed with hits still heard today (unlike Baby One More Time LOL) that people need to just give up on trying to recapture in this lifetime...
B000002A3T|5.0|While not quite Meddle, Animals, or Amused to Death material, The Division Bell is great album.  Gilmour and company really improved on the lackluster (but still listenable) Momentary Lapse and came up with the best Floyd since The Wall.  It may not be cool to say you love The Division Bell, but it is always one of the first Floyd albums I grab for a long car ride - and I have all of them on disc except the soundtrack to More.  I guess it's wishful thinking, but can you imagine if Dave and Roger would just settle their differences and get out on the road?  I might be able to stomach even one last live album for that!
0393035158|1.0|This fool has published a book he didn't even bother to research.  He confuses Catholic doctrine on Virgin Birth and Immaculate Conception, slants his views in a raving style meant to appeal to a person's passions rather than their intellect, and has let careless spelling and syntax errors slip in the text.  It is a misrepresentation of faith in the extreme.  I'm amazed Alan Dershowitz endorsed it... or maybe that sends a message all its own.  Don't waste your money.  Thumb through before you buy.
B000002QWD|5.0|Everyone in my family loves it. My eleven year old daughter adores it. It has is soothing and uplifting music that you never grow tired of. Everyone should own a copy of this CD. We even play it after the holidays.
B00006CXXU|5.0|In this album, Christina tells us with her own words that she's not a girl anymore and she grew up. This album reflects feelings and emotions she have felt through her life.<br /><br />Stripped Intro (track 1) is a great segment to start the album, with all she says and all she feels about what people is talking behind her.<br /><br />The order of the songs is really well done, starting from the strong Christina and finishing with the painful of \\"I'm OK\\". This is a really cool album, but I have a version where \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" is in Spanish; it's called \\"Dame Lo Que Yo Te Doy\\"; translated, \\"Give Me What I Give You\\", and it's very sensual, not sexual. Some songs I personally like the most are \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Underappreciated\\", \\"Soar\\", \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\", \\"The Voice Within\\" and \\"I'm OK\\".<br /><br />\\"Stripped\\" is a great album to continue her career.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|I rented the bourne supremacy tonight expecting it to at least follow the book, making it an awesome movie.  It didnt at all.  It was a decent movie i must say, but cutting out the entire book, except the two or three things that they didnt cut out but manages to screw up anyways.  The only reason this is getting any stars is because the movie was action packed.  Action packed doesnt mean a lot tho, because when you are trying to watch a good chase scene, and every two seconds you jump from one camera view to the other, it just doesnt fit together.  All in all, a total dissapointment if you read the book, and not the best movie if you didnt.
B0006399FS|2.0|Bland and mediocre are words that have appeared in many of the reviews, and I think they apply. The disc doesn't bite, it's just blah. One good song, Vertigo, and that's it. The rest is filler, unfortunately. <br /> <br />I don't necessarily mind the slow stuff and the more thoughtful pieces. Many of my favorite U2 tracks are songs such as Running to Stand Still, Bad, An Cat Dubh, Into the Heart, even Van Diemen's Land. But most of Bomb's tracks are slow without being good. <br /> <br />And except for Vertigo there's little intensity to the disc. So what do you have? An adult contemporary album with U2's name on it (plus the one good rock track). <br /> <br />If you're a U2 fan and completist, of course you're going to buy it - in fact, of course you already have it, just as I do. <br /> <br />If you're a hater here to talk about how other groups are so much better than U2 who you think sux, why are you bothering? If you hate them that much, okay, but is there any real point to posting that stuff where reviews of this disc are supposed to go? And of course you're not going to buy Bomb. <br /> <br />So the real question is what about marginal fans: The type who have Joshua Tree in their collection because it was a must-have album with lots of rock hits, but didn't even bother considering buying Pop (if you even knew it was released)? I'd say skip it or you'll be disappointed. You can catch Vertigo through the radio or video and you're not missing anything by not having the other tracks. In five years, nobody will be listening to this album (unlike War, The Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby). <br /> <br />One thing about the lyrics: if you're listening to rock or pop or hip hop lyrics expecting to be enlightened about politics or economics or religion, you're looking in the wrong place. Turn the volume down and pick up a book about one of those things. That's just what most musicians, including these guys, by definition haven't done.  <br /> <br />Youdon't get to the top of the rock world by paying attention in school. You get there by focusing exclusively on your music from the time you're 15 and you and your friends form a band (U2, for example). That's okay. That's the same way you become a great tennis player or model. But that doesn't mean that Anna Kournikova or Bono has much to offer anyone halfway educated in terms of understanding politics or history. How could they? <br /> <br />Musicians do best lyrically when they stick to things they can relate to just as well as their audience can, such as relationships (or substance abuse, as in Running to Stand Still. Now heroin addiction is a subject lots of musicians ARE qualified to offer something important on). <br /> <br />But in general, don't look for great insight in pop lyrics. If you like the sound, it's a good song. Bomb's problem is, not enough good sounding music.
B00005NKW3|5.0|\\"MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET\\" is the closest thing to a christmas classic you will ever see on this planet. I loved it when I saw it. Edmund Gwenn is PERFECT as Santa. In fact, I think this film is a great classic. If you're ever stuck with absolutely NOTHING to do one wintery-like, and a very low temperatured day, and you are inside with no fire goin' in a fireplace, watch this. And to remember something useful for a review like this, read the title of this review a second time. I don't have experience, but I'm sure it works if you love christmas.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|If you've been to high school, you'll recognize so many characters here, it will be almost excruciating to watch.

0140180575|5.0|``The Beautiful and Damned,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald's second published novel, is a penetrating portrait of the idle rich. It is vital social commentary that previews themes the author would deal with in his next and best book, ``The Great Gatsby.'' <br />The greatest strength and greatest weakness of ``The Beautiful and Damned'' is that it doesn't have even one likable character. The closest we come is Muriel Kane, the friend of Gloria who volunteers for World War I nurse duty, and Joseph Bloeckman, the producer who tries to get Gloria into the movies. Bloeckman's line of work leads one to think his friendship is illusory like a movie. <br />The story revolves around Anthony Patch, grandson of multimillionaire Adam Patch, and Gloria Gilbert, Anthony's wife. The family name is a clue that something is being masked the way a patch covers a hole. This turns out to be grandpa Patch's sleazy life as a Wall Street operator. His fortune secured, Adam Patch attempts repentance by becoming a social reformer and prohibitionist. If alive today, the senior Patch would no doubt have a talk show on right-wing radio. <br />Anthony, an only child and layabout Harvard grad, is waiting for his grandfather to die so his life can begin in earnest. Gloria is equally aimless (who says alike repel?). Gloria, also an only child from parents living above their means, complains regularly about odors and people's cleanliness. Gloria doesn't complain about the cleanliness of boozer and smoker Anthony because he comes with the most pleasant smell of all -- the sweet savor of money. <br />Grandfather Patch proves rather durable and this causes the marriage of Anthony and Gloria to become nearly unendurable. Money gets tight and the couple ventures out into employment with humorous and sad results -- Anthony as a stock salesman and Gloria as an actress. <br />Fitzgerald's legendary wit is fully on display throughout. He roasts situations and institutions as well as his characters -- <br />On war (p. 249 of the Penguin paperback edition): ``Wilson and his cabinet -- a cabinet that in its lack of distinction was strangely reminiscent of the twelve apostles -- let loose the carefully starved dogs of war, and the press began to whoop hysterically against sinister morals, sinister philosophy and sinister music produced by the Teutonic temperament. Those who fancied themselves particularly broad-minded made the exquisite distinction that it was only the German Government which aroused them to hysteria; the rest were worked up to a condition of retching indecency.'' <br />On peace (p. 319): ``Over in Europe the usual number of children had swollen stomachs from starvation, and the diplomats were at their customary business of making the world safe for new wars...Peace had come down in earnest, the beginning of new days.'' <br />Anthony, survivor of a Job-like experience, finally gets what he thought he wanted. Gloria is back to her essential self. A happy ending? Not exactly. Purposelessness has taken its toll. <br />There is much biography weaved into ``The Beautiful and Damned'' and that adds poignancy. The lives of Fitzgerald and wife Zelda greatly mirror Anthony and Gloria. It is amazing how a man can embrace a lifestyle yet mercilessly criticize it. This is testimony to Fitzgerald's uniqueness and power. Less honest and less talented people could not produce such work. <br />
B0002B15PG|5.0|Not being a Crowe fan, I was a little uneasy, but any concerns vanished in a flash of powder smoke. I was literally \\"blown out of the water\\" by this film. This is one of the most accurate depictions about the Royal Navy. While the story line dragged a bit, it more than made up for it with the battle scenes. Spectacular! This is NOT your typical Erroll Flynn Hollywood pirate rubbish!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Ok who didnt know a kid like this in High School???  I think this is an interesting story and is a movie you shouldnt miss.  Napolean is quite the ubernerd for sure.  He mucks through high school though and does ok, making for several funny and interesting events that we the viewers get to see.  This movie definitely has a little something for everyone and is definitely a must see and must have for every movie buff!
B00008J4P5|5.0|This CD plain rocks. It is a broad ranging composition. Nearly every song has a slightly different style, but all have a great guitar hook. This material is fresh and brings the fun back to modern rock. Check this out asap.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|It's hard to find a movie you'll have more fun watching this year over Shaun of the Dead. It's stylish with great one-liners and good comic acting. It does manage to even be scary at times. It makes fun of other zombie movies while being one itself. However it's still a much better zombie movie than any of the Resident Evil movies. The violence can even make you cringe at times. It does have times when it takes itself serious and where it can even be touching as well.  It makes for a good movie to watch with buddies and some beers. Can even watch it with your g/f too since there's some romance in there. Beats being forced to watch a romantic comedy with J-Lo or Ben Affleck lol.
B000002JSR|5.0|I have heard many people put down this album like its just second rate junk. Not true. But it is true that the album is composed of outtakes and unused material from previous releases. But the interesting fact is the when you take a \\"supergroup\\" like zeppelin, and put out their second rate material, you are still going to find that it's better than almost anything else you find out there today. I'm not going to sit and lie to you that this is the best album out there. It's not the first zeppelin cd you should own. But it is an excellent variety and snapshot of what zeppelin was really all about... Doing what they feel, and experimenting and not caring what anyone else thinks! Turns out, they became legends in the process! Buy this album if you have other zeppelin cds, and you'll be pleasantly surprised I assure you!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I bought this movie without ever seeing it... BIG mistake.  This movie sucks so very painfully.  All the funny stuff you see in the previews are the only highlights you will see in the whole movie.  What's worse is that it takes forever for the scene to get to that lame punchline that when it happens you just get mad because it is such a let down.  This movie wasted my $20 gift card and two hours of my life that I will never get back.
B000268QB2|5.0|'Hopes and Fears' is one of the best debuts this year. There is nothing ground breaking about the music, just simple love songs, lots of piano, and a guy with a great, soaring voice. A little bit like fellow UK rockers Travis.<br /><br />The cd opens with the brilliant 'Somewhere only we know', a tender song featuring beautiful, almost choir boy vocals, soaring in the chorus. This sets the pace for the rest of the cd. Very catchy songs that get right to the point.<br /><br />'We Might as well Be Strangers', 'She Has No Time', and 'Bedshaped' are great sweeping ballads. 'Your Eyes Open' is more upbeat and is fantastic, and 'Untitled 1' is simply fantastic too.<br /><br />Great music from the shores of the UK.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 is one of those rare bands that deserves every bit of popularity they've obtained.  Their knack for writing catchy, intelligent melodic rock is matched by very few.  While Bono is often accused of being arrogant and pretentious (which may be true; never met the guy, so I couldn't say), he is undeniably a very talented fellow.  He has one of the most distinctive and emotive voices in all of rock, and his lyrics are poignant and poetic.<br /><br />The band are certainly no slouch in the talent department either.  The Edge is often ridiculed for being a \\"simple\\" guitarist, but what he does with that simplicity is amazing.  He can create melodic soundscapes and atmospheres that are like no other guitarist, and he always complements the song perfectly.  Adam Clayton's basslines are always prominent and memorable, and Larry Mullen is a solid groove drummer.  People who accuse these guys of being bad musicians obviously expect to be knocked over by insane chops, and are totally missing the point.  Their loss, I suppose.<br /><br />\\"The Joshua Tree\\" is simply a perfect album, and some of U2's finest work.  The opening track, \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", is a sprawling epic of mesmerizing ambient guitar and synth melodies, creating some really magnificent atmospheres.  \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" is semi-folky, perfectly evoking the imagery of a small Irish village.  \\"With or Without You\\", and \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" were the mega-hits, with inescapable melodic hooks.  But every song on here is fantastic, from the affectionate \\"Running to Stand Still\\", to the short, chipper \\"In God's Country\\", to the weird country-flavored \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\", to the dark, sinister groove of \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", to the hypnotic chants of \\"Exit\\", to the super-infectious melodies of \\"One Tree Hill\\", to the staggeringly beautiful closer, \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\".  Each song is distinctive, memorable, and most importantly, good.<br /><br />U2 is one of the most talented rock bands of the last 20 years, and everyone should own this classic release.  \\"War\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" are must-haves as well.of the last 20 years, and everyone should own this classic release.  \\"War\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" are must-haves as well.
B0006399FS|5.0|I am a big U2 fan, and have loved all the changes in style they've been through including, yes, 'Pop' which I think is brilliant and was overlooked by most who expect an act to sound exactly the same on every album.<br /><br />I love the new cd. My favourite song has to be the tender 'A man and a woman'. Bono is simply outstanding on this song, and I love the line about true love finding you even if you run.<br /><br />Other standouts are the rocking 'Vertigo', 'Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own', 'Fast cars', 'City of blinding lights', 'All because of you', the religious 'Yahweh', 'Miracle drug', and 'Original of the Species'.<br /><br />Pulsing synths, rocking guitars and racing drums make for another outstanding outing from U2. Add to that Bono's simply outstanding and passionate voice. One of the very best cds you'll hear this year.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris is a brave soul. There is no doubt that his book will bring forth vitriol from devout believers, but I'm glad that somebody has started this long overdue conversation. He makes his point well that science has evolved from the flat earth theory, that our societies have evolved into more pluralistic and intelligent states, yet religion persists in lagging far behind in usefulness and reason. Everybody knows that religion is one topic that will spoil a good dinner party because few people will credit a difference in belief. Everybody wants to be right and that leads to bitter conflict. Harris is stirring the pot of controversy by stating his opinions with reason and verve. I'd be glad to be his dinner companion anytime.
0671027387|3.0|Having just read Dan Brown's novel THE DA VINCI CODE with great pleasure, I snagged a copy of DECEPTION POINT to continue my vicarious romp with Brown's action-packed characters.  As I had expected, the action is fast and furious from the first page to the last.  However, this novel seemed less polished than the other, with more scenarios that demanded a major effort on the part of the reader to find them believable.<br /><br />You see, the real art of fiction is that, while it is not historical truth, it must be perceivable as such by the reader if the fiction is to be successful.  While acknowledging that what he is reading is imaginary, the reader should be able to suspend his disbelief and accept, during the time he is engrossed in the story, that everything really did happen just as the author describes.  If events become too outlandish, the illusion of reality is destroyed, and the effectiveness of the story is diminished.<br /><br />In DECEPTION POINT, everything is charging along just fine when three of the protagonists plunge off the edge of a glacier.  Instead of falling into the frigid ocean, however, they all land-alive and not even critically injured-on an ice shelf that has dropped below the surface of the main glacier and that is ready to calve into the ocean.  A well-placed grenade by one of the antagonists does indeed cause the ice shelf to break from the glacier and to plunge into the freezing waters below. Our protagonists not only ride the ice down to the ocean but they also survive being submerged in the water as the ice shelf hits it and manage to stay on top of the slick ice as tons of ocean water cascade off of it as it rises to bob, now an iceberg, above the water.<br /><br />The iceberg is now floating rapidly out to sea, and our characters are on the verge of freezing.  How do they escape?  Here comes a feature right out of classical Greek drama, a Deus ex machina.  This translates as \\"God out of the machine\\" and refers to the rescue of human characters in the drama from whatever inescapable dilemma they've got themselves into through the intervention of a god who rises, literally, through the stage floor thanks to a hidden mechanical lift (the \\"machine\\").  In DECEPTION POINT, the god appears in the form of a secret submarine that had been lying silently on the floor of the ocean very near the spot where the glacier calved.  It rises from the ocean exactly as the god rose from the floor on that classical stage.  Talk about miraculous intervention!<br /><br />Another great example of credulity-stretching is the crash of the antagonists' helicopter directly above a giant magma dome on the floor of another ocean, its warhead-equipped missiles all exploding and rupturing the dome, causing an undersea volcano that opens up a great whirlpool on the surface, thereby sucking down the ship on which the last antagonist has been marooned.<br /><br />After reading THE DA VINCI CODE, I pictured the protagonists there as being something of a cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond.  The characters in DECEPTION POINT are, at their most believable, pure James Bond.  In those places where the action surpasses the point of verisimilitude, and there are many more than the few I have used as examples, the level of ridiculousness surpasses even that of Peter Sellers as Chief Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies.  At least Sellers' extravagant humor is intentional!<br /><br />The action, intrigue, suspense, and mayhem plunge ahead in wild abandon throughout DECEPTION POINT.  The novel is a fast read and highly entertaining for anyone who does not demand too much realism in his fiction.

B00000F2JL|5.0|I am so grateful that our PBS station featured The Snowman video over 20 years ago. It was instantly captivating and we immediately ordered a VHS copy to have in our home. This story gives children an opportunity to use their imaginations and to enjoy a bit of wonderful \\"magical fantasy\\". I began giving a copy of the Raymond Briggs video, book, and plush \\"The Snowman\\" doll as gifts for baby showers. Children love the story and it provides a nice contrast to the hurly burly and commercialism that seem to be the hallmarks of Christmas in modern times.

Turns out I almost chucked the book at the same place but doggedly slogged through thinking there would be a payoff that justified the Pulitzer. It never got any better. All I can say it must have been a slow book year, akin to giving an academy award to a 60's beach party movie. It is the WORST book I've ever read. The characterizations were were stereotypical and offensive, the plot was banal, and the characters themselves (with the minor exception of the ever-suffering cop) lacked any quality that made one care what happened to any of them. If you've lived a very sheltered life (and the author apparently lived with his mother and didn't the house until he committed suicide) this may seem funny; I felt that I wasted time that could have otherwise been spent reading a GOOD book.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|If you are a fan of Tull's 70's albums, specifically the more acoustic leaning \\"Songs From the Wood\\", then you will LOVE this disk. It's almost as if Ian Anderson and company travelled back three decades and tapped into a sound all but lost with today's over-produced, and under-performed music. Songs like \\"Jack Frost\\", \\"Pavane\\" and \\"Last Man\\" could all have easily been inserted into earlier Tull disks like \\"Benefit\\" or \\"Minstrel In the Gallery\\". The forgotten classics included here; \\"Weathercock\\" and \\"Another Christmas Song\\" have been slightly updated, and are nice to re-visit. If you are tired of being beaten over the head with an Ashlee Simpson-Clay Aiken Christmas, then treat yourself to a group of real musicians, real songwriters doing what they do best. This is one Christmas album you won't want to put away after the holidays, and one that sounds just as good in July.

Then check out [...] <br /> <br />If you are like me, you might have heard of the Black Keys in connection with the White Stripes. It seems that a lot of people like to throw around a comparison between the Stripes and the Black Keys. This is a comparison that the members of the Black Keys themselves get a bit frustrated with. The Black Keys are another two piece band just like the Stripes but other than that and some of the guitar riffs that are found on the album. it is pretty hard to draw a comparison. The latest release from the Black Keys \\"Rubber Factory\\", still has a hint of White Stripes mixed in and in particular in the guitar on a couple of tracks. But instead it invokes more of an old school 60's and 70's type sound more than it ever does the White Stripes. I consider this to be a modern day throwback album. A 2004 blues album, with a bit of garage rock mixed in there as well. <br /> <br />If you take John Lee Hooker, Jimi Hendrix, The Whitestripes, and even a bit of Tom Wilson from Junkhouse and throw all of their styles and voices in a big ol' pot over a fire, and let that stew for a while. What you get is the Black Keys. Its a medley of different genres, combined into one awesome package. Speaking of packages, the way the album itself is packed is pretty cool. The whole concept plays off the title \\"Rubber Factory\\", and the liner notes are done up like each page is a different shift the band worked. Equipped with a punch in and punch out time. The only problem with it, is it makes a bit difficult to find the lyrics. This album is filled with grimy vocals, and grungey guitars, with powerful drums. And this is a sound that is unique to the Black Keys, I'd be hard pressed to think of anyone else current doing anything like it. <br /> <br />There are not any bad songs whatsoever on this album. 13 songs, and 13 quality songs. Ya a couple aren't quite as good as the others, but I am not about to call the misses just for the sake of sticking to my regular format. And yes I repeat this again and again, BUT what seperates a wicked album, from an ok album with good songs. Is an album without filler. This album with 13 songs all of which are good or tremendous, might just very well make a lot of people's tops for 2004 lists. I know as of right now its trending to be on mine. Its inspired me to dip further back into the Black Keys catalogue. So i advise very highly to check out the Black Keys. If you like your blues infused with garage rock, or if you like your garage rock without the lame mainstream qualities that some of the newer garage rock bands.... (I'm looking in your direction Jet) then the Black Keys are the band for you. \\"Rubber Factory\\" will not disappoint. <br /> <br />Songs I can recommend:\\"10 AM Automatic\\", \\"Just Couldn't Tie Me Down\\", :\\"Girl is on my Mind\\", \\"The Lengths\\", \\"Keep Me\\", \\"Till I Get Away\\". <br /> <br />Score out of 10: 9.0
B00065U08Q|4.0|the more albums john frusciante releases, the more he reminds me of the pixies. he doesn't sound a thing like the pixies,.but he has this ability to make songs i either love to death or just plain dislike, there's usually no middle ground for me. for example, this album has only one real bright spot (the afterglow), can't get the song out of my head,.....the rest will take time to grow on me.  <br /> i've had \\"to record only water for 10 days\\" for about 18 months and the next album of his i got was \\"shadows collide..\\" about 6 months ago,..but all of these other albums \\"the will to death\\" , \\"inside of emptiness\\" , \\"dc ep\\" \\"automatic writing\\" and \\"a sphere...\\" i've just gotten a hold of in the last month,.so i have a lot of stuff to absorb,..but as i said ..he either hits or misses,.. <br />   i love his songs like \\"second walk\\" \\"going inside\\" and \\"loss\\" songs where his voice and guitar complement one another. unfortunately this album doesn't have any gems like those, but as i said, \\"afterglow\\" hooks me in,.and \\"communique\\" is a long hypnotic number,..the other songs are a bit faceless and have no identity ,.yet.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Wanna read more of this review? or more review in general then check out my site @ [...] <br /> <br />Let me begin by saying that in my opinion \\"American Idiot\\" is the greatest Green Day album of all time, and that in my estimation the competition isn't all that close. And I know a thing or two about Green Day, I have all the cds since Dookie..... including the rarities album, and though I enjoy them all I don't think any of them compares to \\"American Idiot\\". And though I love all the other Green Day albums until their new release they had been one of my guilty pleasures. A band that never really pushed boundaries, a band that had a cool singer with a good voice and made catchy little punk and sometimes pop songs that were fun to listen to. When they attempted to do otherwise.... see \\"Warning\\" (which I think was unjustly criticized a bit), they received criticism and massive backlash from the fans and the media. So the mission for Green Day was for them to create a departure...... without leaving the extremely volatile genre of punk rock. Mission accomplished. <br /> <br />Do not believe anything you read debating about whether or not this album is punk. This album is without a doubt punk, it has the punk attitude, it is aggressive, and the songs are succint and the lyrics are intense. Basically any argument against this being punk goes like this... \\"Green Day is really pushing boundaries and being extremely experimental and political with this album..... therefore it is not punk.\\" So just a restate..... apparently Rolling Stone / Jamshowbiz / the Toronto Sun..... and some other articles i've read feel that if your album is innovative.... that is not punk. Therefore by definition punk must be, \\"Stale, old, and done a million times before\\". I'm not buying that. Anyone writing a review like that is the problem with punk anyhow..... people are way too busy trying to protect the genre and not listening to good music. <br /> <br />Green Day calls this album a punk opera,there is talk of making it into a feature film. And I give them full marks for attempting such a bold album. And it is really a must have if you enjoy green Day whatsoever. It flows together really well, and if you are the type who enjoys cool lyrics than that is just an added bonus. <br /> <br />Songs I can recommend: \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", \\"St. Jimmy\\", \\"letterbomb\\", \\"Whatshername\\" etc. <br /> <br />Score out of 10: 8.5
B00000JGHM|5.0|thank god there will finally be a 2 disc special edition of \\"heat\\"<br /><br />is there anyone else out there who upon watching \\"heat\\" for the first time at the cinema , walked out of the cinema in an absolute daze, wondering what the hell just hit you ? i had to go back the next day and watch it again. then i watched it 5 more times in the next 2 weeks. that has never happened to me before,.but not surprisingly, michael mann is not just another director.<br /><br />  it's obvious michael mann treats his audience with respect and love, by crafting such characters with an intricacy and depth seldom few filmamkers can achieve. his choice of music from the opening credits from the kronos string quartet,the uplifting \\"ultramarine\\" from michael brook, right through to moby's \\"new dawn fades\\" is sublime , the dialogue is never insulting or simple, always precise and he never makes it seem like he's spoon feeding the viewer. the visuals are magnificent, and the interconnecting plots are always engaging,....showing how 1 tiny mistake in letting waingro escape can have catastrophic results at the movie's end. i've seen a lot of these actors in other movies where they just plain suck (eg. jon voight in varsity blues is simply apalling, yet in \\"heat\\" as de niro's mentor / fence he is brilliant and believable.) Even the notoriously difficult Val kilmer said he had a wonderful time making \\"heat\\" and michael mann had nothing but praise for val. i suspect they call val kilmer difficult because he questions things when they don't feel right,.but michael mann at the helm,.what is there to question ? he has everything covered.<br /><br />  aside from having probably the 2 most respected actors of their generation playing the heavyweight roles, even smaller characters like donald breedan and his girlfriend are touching as the ex-con trying to go straight and his loving partner trying her heart out to keep him good,..it just makes your heart break when he caves in and decides to acceptneil's offer to fill in as the driver for the heist , because you know it will end badly.<br /><br />  the depth and breadth of this masterpiece cannot be summed up succinctly, it simply has everything i have ever wanted from a film. perhaps if neil had gotten away i might have loved it just a little bit more,..because i always want the intelligent bad guy to get away,.but still,.i can't wait to see what extra features the new 2 disc edition will have, so i can finally satiate my appetite and absorb as  much as i can about possibly the best american film of the last decade, if not all time. this movie will stand the test of time, i have absolutely no doubt.<br /><br />  i suspect there are many others out there who know what i am referring to when i say michael mann is the director that all others are to be measured against. nobody makes motion pictures like michael mann, someone who knows how to use all the elements and ingredients available to him. i feel like an intelligent human being capable of lateral thinking when i watch a michael mann film and i'm sure i'm not alone.
B0006399FS|3.0|For a more thorough look at this review, and many more please check out [...] <br /> <br />U2's perseverance boggles my mind. I mean, can you name any other band that managed to survive the 80's, persevere the 90's and still be nearly if not as big as they ever were today in 2004? I was talking about this the other day, and I just can't figure it out. Why of all the possible bands that could have pulled off this impressive fight does the one that is able to do it have to be U2? Let it be known I don't hate U2, and have at times owned or currently own some of their albums. But seriously the point is NOBODY else has done this. R.E.M you say? Absolutely not, their last three albums haven't done much and they are nowhere near as strong today as U2 is. Aerosmith? Aerosmith still has a big following and makes massive money on tour, but when they release a studio album it tends to received as a bit of a joke. For some strange reason, U2 has been granted this automatic pass to super stardom. And regardless of the quality of the music they release they keep their popularity, and the next album they release is more hyped than ever. After hearing \\"Vertigo\\" which is plastered all over the radio and television right now I decided I must review this album. Personally, I think \\"Vertigo\\" blows, and it really upsets me that such an average song is getting massive airplay when much better music doesn't see the light of day on radio or much or mtv. So I borrowed the album and prepared to hate on it. <br /> <br />The only problem is the album really wasn't all that bad. In fact, \\"Vertigo\\" is likely the song I like the least on the whole album. The album is getting mixed reviews, but I find it amusing because good or bad the reviews are saying the same thing. Either the album is awesome because it is U2 going back to their roots, and releasing an album filled with the type of songs that made them so popular in the first place, or the album is a disappointment because it lacks originality and is more or less just recycled new versions of songs they have released before. Kinda shows how objective album reviews can be eh? I think the latter is a far criticism, but then again in defence of U2 what the hell were you expecting? The saying you can't teach an old dog new tricks definitely applies to this band of Old Dogs. The days of them releasing innovative new sounding albums like \\"Pop\\" probably died when they released \\"Pop\\" and it was by far the least well accepted album they ever released. In further defence of U2, a few of the songs on this album truly do sound unique, and I like this album more than anything U2 has done since \\"The Joshua Tree\\". But that isn't saying too much because i didn't really love any other album U2 has ever released besides \\"The Joshua Tree\\" <br /> <br />Songs I recommend: \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", \\"Love & Peace Or Else\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Original of the species\\". <br /> <br />Score out of 10: 7.3
B00004XOWM|1.0|Perhaps a more appropriate title for this album shouldve been \\"We are whitetrash idiots who suck balls at making music\\" <br /> <br />Fred Durst should be repeatedly flogged for spawining this crap.   <br /> <br />Here are some catchy lyrics for your next album: <br />L-I-M-P Bizkit is real quere. <br /> <br />You think i have no talent?

B00026YO36|4.0|For a more thorough review of this album, and many other albums check out my site at [...] <br /> <br />This has been out since August, and for all that time I promised myself I would eventually make an effort to find out more about it. So much time has passed, I can't even truly say what song I remember seeing the video for on Wedge. Mark Lanegan my research tells me is the ex frontman for the short lived, and critically acclaimed Screaming Trees. He also has been a long time member of Queens of The Stone Age. Not surprisingly members of the aforementioned band are scattered throughout this recording. Just off the Queens of the Stone Age connection alone I anticipated a peppy rock record, the title of the album \\"Bubblegum\\" re-inforced my belief. I was wrong. <br /> <br />Instead this is dry, grungy, Tom Waitts style rock. Every sentence spit from Mark Lanegan's mouth is done so with a sort of intensity, not intensity in terms of the pace of how loud it is, but just an intensity that you pick up in the roughness of his voice and the forceful way he delivers the lyrics. The album doesn't stray from this sound, although there is a fair amount of range to the songs. The basic formula is constant throughout. The lighter songs are actually the more rocking songs. When the Mark Lanegan Band picks up the pace of the songs, they come across as more typical and to be honest they don't come across as strong as the stylish slow sound that works so well on the best songs. Mark Lanegan borrows the help of some fun collaborators such as PJ Harvey, The guys from QOTSA, Duff Mckagan and Izzy Stradlin from Velvet Revolver, Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs and his current band The Twilight Singers), and more. The use of these distinctly different talents allows for the album to show range that otherwise they might be limited by due to Lannegan signature growl. If you had the chance to hear Joe Strummer's album that came out in 2003, that is a good precursor for this sound. Just take out thereggae, and poppiness of Joe Strummer's voice and you are pretty much left with Mark Lanegan. <br /> <br />Songs you should check out: Songs that you should download: \\"Hit The City\\", \\"Wedding Dress\\", \\"One Hundred Days\\", \\"Strange Religion\\", \\"Like Little Willie John\\", \\"Head\\", \\"Driving Death Valley Blues\\" <br /> <br />SCORE OUT OF 10: 9.2
1577311523|3.0|I found it interesting that Tolle is such a good writer after sitting on a park bench for two years, this seems kind of hard to believe. I would like to know more about his actual history, because in order to evaluate anything, you need to know the source and the motivation. Are all the proceeds for this book going to charity or to help others, or is this just a way to get rich with another technique? One thing I learned in school is that you don't blindly take any information given to you as fact, without knowing the motivation and source. <br /> <br />The book does take a good concept that I have found in other texts, which is focusing on 'the Now', rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future - this is rather common sense unless you are overwhelmed in some fashion from a past event or future issue. Other texts like '7 Habits for Highly Effective People' address this by focusing only on your circle of control, rather than your circle of concern - your concerns are things that may likely be in the past, which is over, and the future, over which many things you have no control. I think '7 habits' did a better job. The idea of different thoughts in your head looking at your mind working is fine, but it is more about learning to quiet those voices in our heads that worry too much about things we have no control over, than it is some other 'presence'. I must say Tolle comes up with some neat tags for things, along with 'pain body'. Again, hard to believe he was sitting on a park bench for a couple years being happy, rather than taking some coursework on psychology, writing and literature. <br /> <br />Tolle is repetitive in this 'Now' issue, and sure, it works to some degree, but it leaves a lot out, maybe intentionally so he can come up with the next book about how to implement these ideas - super idea if you want to make a lot of money, or am I just being the cynic? <br /> <br />So, to be critical, it is an interesting book, but I found it to be tooone dimensional, you can get more out of some other good books out there - I think about one chapter in a booklet would have gotten the idea across, and stretching it out actually dilutes the power of the idea - certainly a book about focusing on the 'Now' shouldn't take so long to read, eh?
B00026W82U|4.0|If you want to read more about this album or just see other reviews then check out [...] <br /> <br />A few months back I had heard about a new release from a band who I thought had an awesome name, Kings of Convenience. I had never heard of them in my life, and up until yesterday still had never heard a track. However, I had seen them on a few indie rock/college radio lists, and read a few decent reviews for the album, so I downloaded it. Last night I heard it for the first time, and it was nothing like I ever expected it to be. However, not neccessarily in a bad way. <br /> <br />\\"Riot on an Empty Street\\" has a different sound. The first band that came to mind when I listened to this album was Simon and Garfunkel. No jokes. Simon and Garfunkel's influence can definitely be felt in this album, especially in the melodies and the way the vocals are sung. Another influence in the album that can be felt is a kinda lounge feel. The songs are really chill. Kings of Convenience are always going well below the speed limit, keeping their songs relaxing and well crafted but not deviating from this path throughout the album. The guitar in the album is isolated, and seems to be kept disctintly to its own track. So when you are listening to it you can't help but focus on the guitar track and what is going on with that, or if you prefer you can let yourself get into the lounge groove that comes along with the lyrics. <br /> <br />If you want to look at it in a current context. It kinda sounds like John Mayer, except without the mainstream element that John Mayer infuses into all of his music. The tempo of a lot of the songs, and the sound of the singer's voice are the reasons why I think this is a fair comparison. But.... The Kings of Convenience are in no danger of bombarding your radio and music video stations like John Mayer does/is due to the fact that they do not have overly catchy chorus's, and their songs are abstract enough that only a certain type of listener would seekthem out. <br /> <br />ts really hard to sum up this album. Firstly I give credit to Kings of Convenience for creating a sound that is distinct in this day in age. at the same time, I can't give them too much credit seeing as that if this came out in the 60's, people would have just called the band a Simon and Garfunkel rip off. Then again.... essentially everybody rips someone else off. Its just some are better at doing it than others. Regardless, I find the sound they have created on this album growing on me. First listen, I probably would have given it less than a 7. Yet now I find myself contemplating if an 8 would be too much of a stretch. If you have a fairly rounded musical taste, and enjoy minimalistic music with great lyrics, and cool guitar WITHOUT much rock to speak of whatsoever then check it out. If you like Jack Johnson, or Simon and Garfunkel then check it out. Otherwise, steer clear. This CD is not for all audiences. <br /> <br />Songs I can recommend: Songs you should download: \\"Homesick\\", \\"Misread\\", \\"Stay Out of Trouble\\", \\"Know How\\", \\"Love is no Big Truth\\" <br /> <br />Score out of 10: 7.5

B0001LJCMK|5.0|Wanna read more of this review?  Or just more reviews in general check my site @ [...] <br /> <br />The best way I can describe the Eagles of Death Metals is that they remind me of a cross between Queens of the Stone Age mixed with the Darkness. The music..... is similar to me to the of Queens of the Stone Age, except the album in general lacks the seriousness, or the grunginess that a Queens of the Stone Age record does. This is where the Darkness comes in, it almost seems like the album itself is done in a bit of jest. There are no deep serious thinker songs, there are no downers anywhere on the album. Everything is up beat, perhaps even a bit too up beat. <br /> <br />The lead single and opening track \\"I Only Want You\\" is an awesome song. My girlfriend and I first heard it on Wedge, and over the days and weeks to follow the song gained momentum, and we started to hear good things about the album. Later we found out the singer from Queens is actually the drummer for the Eagles of Death Metal (weird?). Which added to their hype a bit. The lead single is a simplistic song, a back and forth rock song with guitars playing off one another, and the falsetto voice of J. Everett Hughes repeatedly exclaiming that \\"I only want you\\". This is a bouncing around your house, rocking out by yourself song. Its inevitable, you can't help it. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the more original sounding albums I have heard this year. You can't help but get in a better mood when you slip this into your CD player, and for a change you don't have to deal with a few songs that you want to skip when you put it in. Is this album rocket science? No.... heck some of the songs have maybe 20 words in them, the rest is all repitition. But its part of the style. And I like it. <br /> <br />Songs I can Recommend: \\"I Only Want You\\", \\"So Easy\\", \\"Flames Go Higher\\", \\"Stuck in the Metal With You\\", \\"Kiss the Devil\\", \\"Whorehoppin\\" just to name a few. <br /> <br />Score out of 10: 8.9re out of 10: 8.9
B000687M48|5.0|Evanescence's live CD/DVD package \\"Anywhere But Home\\" is beautiful in itself, but all in all, its just something to hold the fans over with until the sophmore album. As many hardcore fans (like myself) have already done, we've already heard the \\"unreleased\\" material (not on \\"Fallen\\") such as \\"Farther Away\\", \\"Breathe No More\\", and \\"Missing\\". New material absolutely saves this release from becoming just a new \\"Fallen\\".     Yes, this is a LIVE release which makes this CD SOO much heavier than on \\"Fallen\\". Amy Lee's headbanging and screaming evoke so much emotion within the audience and pump up the crowd for the rocking hour of showtime. Be forewarned, to parents who like to sing along to the bouncy melodies of \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" - this is not a rock CD, its a METAL CD. It's loud, heavy, and beautifully breathtaking.     Yes, Amy curses slightly in KoRn's \\"Thoughtless\\" but to the lawsuit that is going on currently - its a bunch of crap.  This song is by far the best on the CD.  Also, the extended ending of \\"Farther Away\\" is AB-SO-LUTELY AMAZZZING! If you can listen to that song and not bang your head, you must not have been listening clearly.     \\"Anywhere But Home\\" should gain far more credibility with the metal-heads than \\"Fallen\\" did with mainstream-pop/rockers.  This package also lets radio-listeners know that this ISN'T \\"The Amy Lee Show (and uh, those other guys)\\" - This is EVANESCENCE the BAND. Love them or hate them, you can't deny that \\"Anywhere But Home\\" ROCKS.    Lastly, the DVD is HILARIOUS. The behind-the-scenes footage is the DORK side of Evanescence while you can view the Music Videos (My Immortal, Everybody's Fool, Bring Me To Life, Going Under) and the Live In Paris concert where you'll see the ROCKSTAR side of Evanescence. The concert is shot with fast moving cuts and flashes of color that will really get you lost in the essence of the show.  The videos are 100 times clearer than on MTV/VH1/FUSE and it's a nice treat for the fans.(...)
B000002W9Q|4.0|In 2001 Lauren Rakowski asked if anybody knew the song playing when Baby (love that name) first discovered the employees dancing.  I'm pretty sure that was \\"Love Man\\" by Otis Redding.  The definitive compilation for this soundtrack is (I believe) called \\"Ultimate Dirty Dancing\\" with all of the singles from this package AND the more soulful \\"More Dirty Dancing\\" which I am sure you all have now. The \\"ultimate\\" one is available but not, so far as I know, on Amazon.  Good memories here, but it doesn't compare with its follow-up.  Notable exception: One-hit wonder Bruce Channel's \\"Hey, Baby\\" with Texas bluesman Delbert McClinton on blues harp. So for one-time contributor Lauren who was 13 in the summer of Baby and Johnny, there's your answer.
B00005MCX3|5.0|Often snubbed in favor of 'Space Ritual' or 'Doremi...', this album really deserves to be revered alongside those albums as one of the best from the 'Lemmy' period.  In many ways one could argue that this is the quintessential Hawkwind album.  It encapsulates just about every tangent of their long, strange trip.  Speaker-shredding Blanga, progressive pomp, metallic doom gloom, hippy trippy freakout jam, face-painted Glam theatrics, proto-punk Spit-on-the-Man blastitude, spacey electro-blip drift, it's all here on one shiney, spinning UFO-shaped disc.
B00063MBU8|4.0|im really impressed with simple plan's new album. the music's great, the vocals are awesome, what more could u ask for?? they changed my impression of pop acts. i used to think pop are hopeless music with all the bopping and the bubble-gummy music but simple plan is just awesome!!
B00005JMAH|1.0|I looked forward with great enthusiasm toward this movie.  I was bitterly disappointed by the director Cuaron's work.  His almost complete disregard toward the first two movies and the look and layout of Hogwarts was terrible.  His stylistic sense, which everyone else says \\"totally fit's\\" the darker tone of this book, was boorishly overdone.  Chris Columbus would have been much better in this sense, keeping a dark tone while maintaining the spirit of the series.   <br /> <br />Luckily, Cuaron will not be back to direct any more of  the HP movies.  The worst though has to be how he totally uprooted every physical aspect of Hogwarts.  Nothing was were it was before.  Dark vision I can understand, but things like moving Hagrid's cabin from a flat pasture within sight of the school to a rocky hillside hidden in a small valley serves no purpose other that to put Cuaron's own stamp on the series. I think he had the thought of \\"I'll show these people how to make a REAL movie, not fluff like the others.\\" <br /> <br />Also, the person they replaced Dumbledore with was ludicrous.  Bearing no physical resemblance to him is understandable, but Dumbledore is an ancient wizard, wise in many things and keeper of many secrets, the only person Voldemort is afraid of.  The actor who played Dumbledore's character in this movie was allowed to \\"dumb\\" the character down, and make him into a caricature of a  clueless school principal, AKA Mr Skinner of Homer Simpson fame.  To me that ruined the movie, because it is the interaction of the wise Dumbledore and the impetuous Harry that makes the books work. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is just my two cents.  I think it's obvious that this movie wasn't as well made or as faithful to the book, the series, and it's fans as the first two, because it made about 20% less in profits so far, than the second one.
B00065GX64|5.0|This is a wonderful new release from the Criterion Collection! The quality is far superior to their earlier release of the same film.  <br /> <br />Forgetting the extra DVD, the image-quality alone makes this new release all the worthwhile for serious collectors. The screen is entirely fit this time - you'll actually see black bars on the RIGHT and LEFT of your screen, as the film is presented in a unique aspect-ratio that it was originally shot in. <br /> <br />The grain is scarce. The blacks are deep and rich. The dust & scratches are minimal, and this picture yields a much crisper and sharper image than anything we've ever had before. It's a pretty damn good restoration job if I say so! <br /> <br />If this were most other movies in film history, I might agree that another DVD release is a blatant exploitation, but \\"M\\" is not most movies. If there is a better version out there of some of these 'ultra-legendary' films such as Fritz Lang's \\"M\\", then please someone, make them available to us. I understand that there's been a fairly recent restoration attempt done on Murnau's ultra-legendary \\"Nosferatu\\"...where's the DVD release? <br />At least with this new and largely impressive upgrade of \\"M\\", we got it! <br /> <br />Thank You! Worth it for fans.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Well to start off, my first review unfortuantely got deleted, so if im kind of sloppy bare with me.  Okay to start off, this album is simply amazing, filled with riff after riff it is truly IMO the best metalcore release of 2004.  Guitars, Drumwork, Bass, Vocals they are all standouts for me.  Unearth has the best harmonizing guitars in the music industry today (not to mention awesome breakdowns!).  The drums are also great and plus hes a new drummer in the lineup (Mike Justain of The Red Chord).  The bass has great fast picking, but is less noticeable.  The vocals are just a little above medicore, but is not a threat to the music..... <br /> <br />The Great Dividers (8.5/10): Great opener track! Unearth couldn't have chosen a better song to open with.  The opening riff reminds/resembles a fast paced roller coaster ride, ending with Travis screaming into the mic \\"Does Hate Mean Freedom???\\".  It then explodes into a monster breakdown. <br /> <br />Failure (9.5/10): Starts out with a great riff with ringing out guitar strums.  Explodes into a panned riff which then a second guitar harmonizes with it.  Rhis song has it riff after riff. <br /> <br />This Lying World (9/10): This song is really great! Starts out with the bass reduction effect with the guitars.  The beginning riff has weird tempo changes, and is kind of experimental (not really my type).  It makes up for it with the next riff as well as the rest of the song.  Best part is at 1:04 where the drumbeat of the song changes. <br /> <br />Black Hearts Now Reign (10/10): My first song I ever heard by Unearth! It is insane!  It is filled with the best melodic hooks and riffs.  It is their first single and chosen well.  They play this song really good live, and the music video of it is in the CD because its enhanced.  Just pop it into your computer and watch.  Best part is at 1:10. <br /> <br />Zombie Autopilot (10/10): Starts out with clean guitar then explodes into a swedish metal-influenced riff.  This song alsohas great breakdowns and not to mention an awesome solo.  Great double bass too.  This song has it all! <br /> <br />Bloodlust Of The Human Condition (8/10): This song is pretty good.  It just cant compete with the rest of the album.  This song starts out with distorted drums which then explodes into a huge breakdown.  The ending riff is really good. <br /> <br />Lie To Purify (8.5/10): A perfect example of how good  Unearth can harmonize their guitars!  Travis' voice really stands out in this track.  The clean vocals add a great touch to the whole feel of the song. <br /> <br />Endless (10/10): Incredible track! This song is insane.  I was blown away at :20 with the alternate, palm-muted, harmonized guitars! It then has a great outro.  At 2:29 I guarantee you will be banging your head or moshing.  Possibly the best track on the CD.  it was also formerly on the Endless EP which came right before this release. <br /> <br />Aries (n/a): Not really a track.  Just some bass reduced piano with whispering, clean guitars, bass and Travis screaming with bass reduced reverb and delay.  But it creates a great mood and is a great transition to the next song. <br /> <br />Pretermined Sky (9/10): Awesome song!  Ends with great harmonized tapping.  The great thing about Unearth is they dont take the easy way out by harmonizing their guitars with octaves.  This song is unbelievable alogn with the rest of the album. <br /> <br />False Idols (9/10): Great closer track! Starts out with a pick scrape following it with great riffs.  The drums then have a backwards delay effect with the gutiars ringing out.  Then from there its just awesome.   <br /> <br />This whole album is definetaly worth a buy.  I bought it blindly without listening to any of their songs before.  Also I got it for only $9.99.  Hence, do NOT hesitate to get this album!  You will guaranteed be blown away by Unearth's abilites.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I just received this awesome Bon Jovi box set as an early Christmas present, and I have to say that this is a brilliant showing of their talent.  I have been a fan since 1984, I was nine years old then, and when I listen to these songs on their box set, I remember why I became a fan at such a young age, and why I am still a fan at 29.  The songs are beautiful, original and have that great Bon Jovi sound that I am used to hearing.  Just check out \\"Letter to a Friend\\" song 8 on cd # 4, it is such a great love song, the lyrics are awesome, and it doesn't sound like a conventional power ballad.  Some of the songs are reminiscent of their second album, 7800 Fahrenheit, like \\"Outlaws of Love\\" or \\"We Rule the Night\\", but the latter could have gone on their Slippery album.  I really believe that any true, die-hard fan will appreciate the honesty and raw emotion that appears on this box set.  No, it doesn't have any of their songs from previous albums, and this is precisely why this collection is so unique and special.
0790729342|5.0|I have to say I hade my doubts before I saw this movie. But then after Isaw it I was blown away. The action scenes are awsome and as the last guy said one of the best movies for guys ever. Buy this at all costs. (I also recomend Mad Max and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.)
B00006AW2M|5.0|In 1967, The Rolling Stones were less blues and more psychedelic. Since December's Children they had been changing their stlye, but this album was the most drastic change. They went from an array of styles mixed in with psychedelia to an all out tripfest. The Beatles had been making psychedelic history with Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour. The Stones, always on the dark humored side, decided to make a parody of their rivals' efforts. And that's what this is.  <br /> <br />Instead of listening to a concert by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, we get to sing with them. And while The Beatles tell us \\"We're sorry but it's time to go,\\" the Stones say \\"On with the show good health to you!\\" Wild keyobards (the mellotron flute soudn used on The Beatle's \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is all over this album), honking dramatic brass, and sweet blues guitar licks keep things nice & hot! \\"Citadel\\" has hot Keef power chords, \\"2,000 Light Years From Home\\" is space rock genius. \\"The Lantern\\" is blues and folk and psychedelic all in one. <br /> <br />Okay, its not traditional stones at all. In fact, they seem to totally reinvent themselves on the album, but it s a psychedelic classic. The fact that they do psychedelia so good (of course they weren't new to it) adds to the wonder of it. On with the show indeed.
B00003CXB4|3.0|Having seen Kimba in Japanese long before I saw Lion King, I must say that Lion King is DEFINATELY a ripoff.  To be fair though, there are some unique quirks to the Lion King story and it has very charming characters.  I think that this is truly a masterpiece that is worth seeing, but bear in mind that Disney shamelessly stole the story and refused to acknowledge it.
B00005NKW3|5.0|Great movie, even after all these years.  Black and white or colorized, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Edmund Gwenn as Santa is the heart and soul of this movie.  He is as we all imagine (and hope) Santa to be.  It almost hurts when we see the other characters not actually believing he is the one and only Saint Nick.<br /><br />But the other actors and actresses are also top notch...except for Maureen O'Hara.  She may be the nicest lady in the world ... I don't know ... but she almost single-handedly torpedoes this movie.  It achieves classic status despite her.<br /><br />John Payne plays the lawyer (Fred Gaily) and he is excellent ... a nice understated and believable performance.  And Natalie Wood is cute and believable as the little girl who doesn't believe in Santa Claus.  The rest of the cast is, as I said, superb (not counting Ms. O'Hara) ... giving us a collection of unique characters who fill out the movie nicely.<br /><br />One last thing ... the one scene I like (love) best is the one where the little Dutch girl, who can't speak English, comes to sit on Santa's lap.  A priceless, priceless moment.
B00004VVN9|3.0|Many people may not think of it this way, but I think \\"Brainstorm\\" works as a sort of prequel to 1995's \\"Strange Days\\". In \\"Brainstorm\\" we see the technology in it's developmental stage, and then in \\"Strange Days\\" we see how the technology has become a black market commodity. I wonder sometimes if when James Cameron wrote \\"Strange Days\\" he perhaps thought of his movie as a pseudo-sequel to Doug Trumbull's.<br /><br />Watch the two films and see for yourself.
6304401736|4.0|This movie surprised me.  I had expected the Disney people to give us the same load of hidden sex and I felt sure Glenn Close would have demanded extra screen time ... but I was pleasantly disappointed on both counts.<br /><br />There is absolutely no sexy stuff in this movie, and I wondered if maybe the usual guys at Disney let this one slip through the cracks.  It was great.  And Glenn Close took her screen time ... and not one second more.  And she did a great job too, being very funny and very ... camp ... as Cruella DeVil.  Also, I'm guessing that the cast had fun together.  It just seemed that way.<br /><br />A couple other things worth mentioning ... The movie itself was very well thought through (as far as plausibility is concerned) and it was also very well carried off, which must have been difficult because so many animals were involved.  Also, the lady who plays Jeff Daniels' wife (Joely Richardson) was excellent.  I mean, her character was excellent ... just a nice lady.  No sexy stuff, no derogatory comments to or about men, and no self absorbed words or actions.  Just a nice lady.  And again, I asked myself ... what has happened to the usual band of idiots at Disney?  Were they on vacation?<br /><br />But this is a great movie for everyone.
B0002858YS|5.0|This cd was great i heard it at one of my friends house and i thought it sounded like  The Cure (a good late 70's 80's band) just a little bit. i liked the rock mixed with techno and the drums are good if you just listen to them. i listen to this cd quite often about 3 months actually and it never has gotten old. so if you are looking for something new that sounds good get this.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Sinse when does the meaning of the song matter? Who cares if it's \\"Bush bashing,\\" as some extremists like to label it? I like the songs for the songs not for the political views thrown into them. I don't know about the rest of you, I could care less about the meaning. Besides, neraly every star is a hippie. <br /> <br />And for the ignorant \\"true old green day fans,\\" quit you whining and start liking it. There is nothing wrong with moving into different genres, this album has a little bit of everything. Boulavard of broken Dreams and Give me novacaine, are some slow songs, while St. Jimmy and She's a rebel still have their punk roots. Don't complain about a band for trying new things, complain to yourself about being so closed-minded that you completly abandon a band that helped to define punk. <br /> <br />Anyone who doesn't like the album for either of these reasons is an ignorant fool.
0671027344|5.0|This book was reccommended to me by a very special someone and when I started reading it I was skeptical about it, thinking it was some kind of book that had the same concept as American Beauty(the movie).  As I started reading more and more I couldn't put the book down.  People at work would come and talk to me and I would be short with them because I wanted to get back to the book.  The book is awesome and I highly reccommend reading it.
B000002JKA|5.0|This is a varied and excellent Dream Theater CD. \\"Lie\\" is a thundering, crushing workout, while \\"Erotomania\\" is a dextrous isnstrumental. I actually liked \\"Space Dye Vest\\". It provided somewhat of a respite from the ultra-aggressive instrumental onslaught. Overall, this is one of the better Dream Theater works. The songwriting is strong.  I would disagree with the Amazon reviewer in accusing Rush of sucking the soul out of Rock and Roll with their technical flourishes, however.  Rush's brand of math rock is more organic than Dream Theater's awe-inspiring music-school precision.
1558908455|5.0|From dusk till dawn is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. Both quinten Tarantino and George Cloony are absolutly brilliant together. When it comes down to it, movies of this genre dont get to much better than this. I think this is Quinten Tarantino's best film ever although I cant really say much for the other 2 dusk till dawn's except that they kinda sucked. I even liked it better than Pulp Fiction.
0790740443|4.0|This on the surface looks like a typical cliched movie however it works. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this movie after you have watched it does stay with you. Kurt Russell gives a solid performance as a hardened soldier trained to kill since boyhood and feel no emotion. Finding himself old and obsolete he is forced into a fight to the death with his replacements, a new bread of killer soldier. He loses and finds himself dumped on a garbage waste planet and left for dead. The rest of the movie focuses on Russell's character slowly finding his human side again. When a group of unarmed inhabitants who took him in as one of their own then rejected him because he could not fit are threatened by the military, Russell steps up and the action is fast and enjoyable. The inhabitants have been targeted to test the killing efficiency of the military's new stronger, faster, deadlier group of elite killer soldiers.  This is more than just a bog standard sci-fi action film. It has a good heart at the centre of the story which makes you get behind Russell's character 100%. The movie tanked at the box office on its original release for unknown reasons yet I have not met one person who has seen it and failed to enjoy it.
B00006FDCD|2.0|OK... I admit that i did like this one when i was in middle school. However, when I went to watch it again it seemed hokey and kind of dull. People have told me that this movie made them afraid of clowns for the rest of their lives, but i cant really see it. I was never scared because of this movie even as a kid. The ending was beyond horrible. This supreme fear being was defeated by people punching the spider version of IT in the stomach. This really isnt worth it.
B0006399FS|3.0|I own all of U2's albums and consider their contribution to rock monumental. However, I found \\"Atomic Bomb\\" to be somewhat tepid. Bono seems a little tired, a little slow, a little disconnected from his roots. Without going through a blow by blow, suffice to say that, in spite of 2 or, perhaps, 3 notable songs, the album never really gets off the ground. Then again, living up to albums like \\"War,\\" \\"The Neverending Fire\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\" would be tough for anyone. Led Zeppelin, Queen, Bowie...and an endless parade of others suffered similar fates. There seems to be a limit to the amount of great music any one artist can produce, at least in the world of rock.
B0002OERI0|2.0|I've always hated this band... ultimately trite pop music in spite of their anti-hero garage image. There was a time when people appreciated musicianship even in mainstream music, and had an attention span that lasted longer than three chords. I think Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree sang it best... \\"Music of the future will not entertain, It's only meant to repress and neutralize your brain.\\"
1400049628|5.0|This book is great.  The section on outbreaks is more exciting than most of the recent books I've read.
B00008GKEG|5.0|What's not to like about this set? <br />Great music! <br />In depth facts about the greatest group of all time! <br />Interviews and fantastic footage of the Fab Four! <br />And more! <br />What can one say about this set that hasn't already been said? <br />There's only one thing I can think of. I wish there was an option on these discs to \\"play music selections only\\".  <br />While I truly enjoyed watching the entire anthology, I don't find myself re-watching the discs over and over again (much as I do with normal \\"concert\\" or \\"music video\\" DVDs). If I could put a disc into the drawer and play just the music, these discs would definitely get much more play time in my DVD player. <br />But option or not, it's The Beatles! How can you NOT give them the 5 stars they deserve? <br />Especially when they continue to live on in our hearts more than 40 years after Beatlemania took the country by storm!
B000000QG8|5.0|Let's just say that \\"Irish Tour,\\" which has sold the most copies of any of the late Rory Gallagher's albums, captures one of the finest blues-rock guitarists of our time in peak form. This gem of a live recording was assembled from various gigs across Mr. Gallagher's troubled native Ireland in 1974, and he clearly relishes playing for the home crowd.<br /><br />Mr. Gallagher and company churn through some longer versions of Walk on Hot Coals, Too Much Alcohol, and Who's That Coming, which allows Mr. Gallagher to improvise and experiment a bit. (There's not a bad number here, but why is Just a Little Bit not included on the CD version?)<br /><br />I'm not prone to lavish adjectives on recordings, but there is more than enough intensity, passion, and virtuosity here to help the uninitiated learn what all the fuss is when it comes to Rory Gallagher's place in rock history.
B000002BQK|5.0|I just wanted to know who P Diddy sample from on the \\"Honey\\" song I know is a popular song but I cant remember who it was... thanks I wait for answers... bye <br /> <br /> <br />

B00003CXCT|3.0|Why it says 'first time' and not 'FINALLY on dvd'?... Because...there will be another set of these movies. simple as that. A more definitive set of star wars original trilogy(the set which those who feel let down with the current set will love). that means those who bought this current set will have to buy another one someday. so what exactly did we just buy here?.. just a promotional dvd set to heat up the anticipation for upcoming summer movie.Major star wars fans surely dont consider themselves own the whole nostalgic phenomenon if they only have these version of the series on DVD.And true collectors shouldnt dismiss the original 1977's version,the ACTUAL product which won 7 Academy Awards.
0060987464|5.0|After Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar record was released and his Dead to the World Tour came to a close.  A large amount of people probably looked onto him as a dumb shock rocker and nothing more.  This was his reaction to that. A book that a Manson fan or hater could indulge themselves into before they can decide to rag on him or not; to see the world through his eyes.  I picked this up after becoming addicted to his music, and I must say this only draws me to him even more.  If you plan to get his Antichrist Superstar record or anything prior to that, then this is a great companion.  I bought this sometime soon after purchasing Antichrist, and I must say it certainly puts more things into perspective.  It definitely helps if you want to understand the meanings behind the songs as well as the man and band themselves.  I could not put this book down, I spent all the free time I had reading it (which is not much) and read it in 9 days.   I have read it a second time since then, something I rarely ever do with books and yes, I do plan to read it a third time.  Heck I lost it and bought it again it was so good.      One thing that I found to be interesting is that because it was written during the antichrist Superstar Era, it has 16 chapters or sections, where as the record also had 16 songs.  Both are also divided up into 3 parts.  There are too many parts here to select as my favorite.  And as many other people have said, there are also a handful of parts that may \\"stick to your ribs\\".  So that's a warning to squeamish people, or maybe that was the point in the first place.  The Long Hard Road out of Hell chronicles Manson's Birth, (which is quite funny to see him as a kid in the pictures with KISS style face paint) up until 1997 during his Dead to the world tour.  If you ever had any questions about Manson they will most likely be answered in this book.  It will also put aside all those silly dirty rumors you have heard about him.      It leaves us off in 1997, it covers the albums Portrait of an American Family, Smells Like Children and Antichrist Superstar.  It's been roughly 8 years and 5 albums since then and I feel a sequel is in order.  I feel Manson did try and continue his work as an Author with the Holy wood Novel, but he felt it would be way too censored and thus never released it.  If he were to make another autobiography, there might be too much time needed to fill in.  Awe well, enough with my ramblings.  If you are still not convinced to buy this masterpiece, then read some more reviews, and then come back to mine and see what you think.  I hoped this helped either way.
0790730960|5.0|this is one of the cooler movies out there.the only thing that was kind of disappointing was that it didnt show batman alot till the end.it could have at least showed bruce wayne alot more like they did in the original.but its not just this movie its all super heroe movies.it barely shows the heroe when the movie is about that heroe.but its fine.i cant wait to see batman begins i hope it doesnt have to be so old fashioned like i see in the pictures.i think that micheal keaton should have played the rest of the batmans but i like val and george.i think that batman forever and batman and robin should have got 4 stars like the 1st two when the first two were kind of boring.oh well.this movie still kicks ass.go batman for dc go spider-man for marvel comics
B00005JLKB|5.0|Show: The premise of Smallville is relatively simple: what was it like for Clark Kent as a teenager? This may not have taken up much space in the Superman comics, but the producers dicided to build a whole show about it.  And what a show it is!  Here, Clark Kent is played to perfection by Tom Welling.  I am by no means a comic book fan, or a huge Superman fan for that matter, but Welling is the only person who could play Kent in this show.  Rounding out the cast are Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, Sam Jones III as Pete, Allison Mach as Chloe, Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent, John Shneider as John Kent, and John Glover as Lionel Luthor.  The entire cast is excellent, especially Welling, Kreuk, Rosenbaum, Mach, and Glover.  Season One has Clark Kent learning to deal with his abilities and his strong feelings for Lana Lang.  Season One has many \\"Freak of the Week\\" episodes which wisely took a back seat in Season Two.  The characters are nicely developed throughout the season.  Episodes that particiularily stand out are the \\"Pilot,\\" \\"Metamorphosis,\\" \\"Stray,\\" and the absolutely stunning Season Finale \\"Tempest.\\"  I highly recommend this show to any Superman fan, as well as anyone who likes great TV.  Highly recommended!  5/5 <br /> <br /> <br />Video: Warner Home Video brings \\"Smallville\\" to DVD in a very nice 1.78:1 Widescreen version.  This is really good picture quality for a TV Show, but with the fantastic job Warner Brothers is doing with the \\"Friends\\" sets, what can you expect?  In fact, the quality on the \\"Smallville\\" sets are even better!  Colors are great, the picture is nice and sharp.  Sometimes it can look a tad dark, but thats the way the show is shot, and is not a fault of the transfer.  Very good.  (4.5/5) <br /> <br /> <br />Audio: Every bit as good as the picture quality.  While only presented in Dolby 2.0 Stereo, the sound mix here is pretty comparable to most Dolby 5.1 tracks, and in some cases, even better.  The surrounds are put to nice use during the action scenes, while the rest of the mix remains pretty front-heavy.  The music score, and the various pop songs used throughout the show sound very nice here.  While a full Dolby 5.1 mix would have been appreciated, this mix suits the show perfectly fine.  (4.5/5) <br /> <br /> <br />Extras:  There are producer commentaries on the episodes \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Metamorphosis.\\" Thses are very good commentaries, and they seem to be enjoying themselves, and obviously like the show.  Other extras include deleted scenes from the \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Metamorphosis,\\" an interactive tour of \\"Smallville,\\" a TV Promo Spot, and DVD Rom access to Chloe's \\"Wall of Weird.\\"  (3/5) <br /> <br /> <br />Overall: An excellent show gets excellent DVD treatment.  Nice audio and video quality, and some great extras to boot.  Highly Recommended.  (5/5) <br />
B0001Z363W|5.0|With \\"Hangover Music Vol. 6\\" Zakk Wylde mixes the acoustic elements from his excellent solo album \\"Book of Shadows\\" with the more aggresive rock of the rest of Black Label Society's catalogue. The end result is a very doomy, boozy, southern rock collection of songs that are among the best Zakk's ever written. Nowhere else is the doom/stoner rock feel more prevalent than in the excellent track \\"House of Doom\\", a very catchy number with great riffs and some very good vocal work. Now Zakk Wylde is not exactly a standout singer, but he does interpret the songs with a lot of feeling. <br />As I said, there's a lot of acoustic work in some songs but also a lot of heavy handed riffing that should please most metalheads. And of course Zakk's signature guitar soloing really elevates the songs to a whole new level. He never resorts to just fiddling about the fretboard (like some other guitar \\"heroes\\"), but makes each solo a part of the song, the way it should be. An interesting track is the cover \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\" which is a piano only ballad, its OK, but I found Zakk's vocals somewhat lacking and not fitting the mood of the song. <br />In closing, one of Black Label Society's best so far, no doubt!
B00002MZ4V|5.0|Movies can be good on their own, but without music, they simply wouldn't measure up to what they would be without it. Film scores can sway you into the moment, or take you to another place and time. They are crucial to a film. No one person's music has made audiences believe and feel what they are seeing and hearing in a film than the maestro, John Williams. Not only do I believe that film scores begin and end with Williams, his music, his sound, his touch, seems to be as American as apple pie and coca cola. I have no idea why the Amazon review would say that he may not be everyone's taste. If you like, love, respect, and appreciate great music and talent, then you will not only know most of his most famous pieces, but you will love and cherish them as well. Plus, his scores are probably the most famous, well known film compositions in the history of cinema, give or take a few from other artists. He also was honored, just here the other day, at the Kennedy Center Honors. He seems to be the voice for American audiences and cinema. He is mostly known and recognized for his ongoing relationships with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, and the work he does for their films. Many other films he has worked on, and subsequent scores, may of gone overlooked or are simply forgotten. But they are here. From the smashing anthem of Spielberg's disaster \\"1941\\", to the beautiful score for Oliver Stone's \\"Born On The Fourth Of July\\", there are a number of scores here that are breathtaking and may not of gotten the notice they so rightfully deserve. Others in this category would be his score for Spielberg's feature film debut, \\"The Sugarland Express\\", or his work for the Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman film, \\"Far And Away\\". The hauntingly pretty and holiday like theme for \\"Home Alone\\" is here, and it sounds very similar to his score for the recent \\"Harry Potter\\" films. I wish this disc was new enough for that score to be here. It isn't. His work for the score for \\"Schindler's List\\", is oneof the most beautiful and haunting film theme's I have ever heard. I always think of \\"The Godfather\\" when I hear it for some reason. His anthemic theme for the 1984 Summer Olympica is here as well, and it has always been a classic. If only his work for the Nightly News was included here as well. But it's the big, most famous scores here that always draw the most attention and fanfare. His work on these don't just create a scene, or a moment, but they become it's own self. The \\"Superman\\" theme, the greatest hero them ever written, is so Heroic and uplifting,  that you wish the themes for later superhero films could be something. The Indiana Jones theme from \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\" is another masterful stroke of a hero theme. No one does themes like that but Williams. What's genius is that these two heroic themes fit the character and film so perfectly. They don't become the same with similar hero type movie themes. There are three tracks here from the \\"Star Wars\\" films. The main theme being one of the most exhilarating film scores ever. Just as good is the \\"Emperor's March\\" from \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\". No one can create a tense, suspensefulm chilling mood better either. That brings us to \\"Jaws\\". How many people went to the beach for years afterwards and not thought of that theme?. That is the genius of John Williams. While there are numerous other gifted composers and film scorers, Williams stands above all others. Why?. His music stays with you. It stays with you and effects you the way a normal, great, classic top 40 hit song would. Or a movie itself. No one can measure up to the magic this man has created when the lights dim, the screen snaps to life with moving images, and there is a bucket of popcorn in your lap. He moves us, he scares us, he makes us believe, and he takes us to places no one else has. He is a master, and most of all, a genius. Thanks for the memories and the music, John. The movies are a better thing with you in the game.
B00006WKSZ|2.0|ARE YOU KIDDING ME WHAT A JOKE THE BEST SONG FROM TOYKO TAPES IS MISSING !   WHY DID I BUY THIS?     POOR EFFORT  :(
B00000FCBC|5.0|Its amazing how harsh people can be about this band. If anyone see them live they know they still rock. Something like this: <br />\\"Sellouts. The Garage Days Ep was the bestest. What is this crap and why isn't Lars under a bus somewhere? That would be great if one day they decided to be cool again. I doubt it will ever happen. Too much money in being pansies.\\" <br />Really boggles my mind. Its a shame Metallica cannot be the \\"bestest\\" group anymore. <br /> <br />Anyway, songs like Turn the Page and Whiskey in the Jar are reasons why this album is pretty good.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|If I had to pick a top ten for the year, this double-CD would fit comfortably at number one. When the greatest rock poet of the past twenty years, working at the top of his form, offers a two-fer that's chockablock with exquisite pop ballads and cryptic rock parables, it's kind of a no-brainer. Even without Blixa Bargeld, the Bad Seeds are at the top of their form; the music on \\"Get Ready for Love,\\" for example, begins with a raucous squeal and builds with an intensity usually reserved for revival meetings.  For those fans who complained about the lack of poetry on \\"Nocturama,\\" there's plenty to savor here. Take this Orphic stanza from \\"Spell\\": \\"I have no abiding memory / No awakening, no flaming dart / No word of consolation / No arrow through my heart / Only a feeble notion / A glimmer from afar / That I cling to with my fingers / As we go spinning wildly through the stars.\\" There is also a surfeit of Byron-esque moments that include \\"rhymes\\" such as hysteria/wisteria and Orpheus/orifice, with gratifyingly comic results. Oh, and I shouldn't forget to mention \\"There She Goes, My Beautiful World,\\" which, in addition to being compulsively witty, may also be the best pop ballad Nick and the guys have ever produced. Do despair, however; there are also plenty of morose moments to balance the sublime-what else would you expect from an opus entitled \\"Abottoir Blues\\"? But the upshot is catharsis in the true Aristotelian sense, that of the discharge of powerful emotions (terror, pity,...bloodlust) through art. What more can we--dare we--ask of our artists?
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I had hesitated on seeing this movie until it came out in DVD, because it's a low-budget indie film without any known actors. I mean I totally loved last year's Pieces of April, because the story and the cast touched me a great deal. So with this movie, I found it to be quite enjoyable, because the characters are well written, and the jokes worked. It's a movie that I can relate to, because I have been in Pedro and Napolean's shoes in high school as a outcast.<br /><br />Napolean is a wierd and corky on the outside, but he's very sweet and kind on the inside. Nobody wants to be his friend, and he eventually became Pedro's(a Mexican immigrant) best friend, and he helped him run for President in school! A lot of funny things happen in the process of the campaign, and it was great when Napolean does his skit on stage. He danced with a Michael Jackson style to a song that stole the audiences' hearts and votes.<br /><br />Napolean eventually falls in love with the sweet girl in school, and Pedro won the election. His friend found his soul mate named La Sofauwnduh, a sexy and sultry Black girl. His pathetic uncle who sells breast enhancement products also found the love of his life. So in the end, everyone is happy.<br /><br />This movie is made to look like a home video, but it's  very good for a indie-film. And if you liked Ghost World(Thora Birch and Scarlette Johanson), you'll definitely love Napolean Dynamite(Jon Heder)!
B000003TA4|1.0|First of all, Nirvana sucks.  They were totally unoriginal and lame.  They looked lame, they sounded lame and they were total dorks.   <br /> <br />Rock stars should look cool.  For those of you that don't know what this means, it means you should wear tight leather pants, lots of chains and shiny metal objects, and have tattoos on every exposed surface of your skin.  Did Nirvana have any of this?  No. <br /> <br />Rock stars should sound cool.  That means that they should be able to screech long and loud like Axl or Robert Plant.  They should play long and fast guitar solos (like Megadeth), and they should sing about how much money they have and how many chicks they bang.  At the very least, they should be able to brag about how great they are in song.  Did Nirvana do any of these things?  No. <br /> <br />Rock stars should be totally original too.  Nirvana's style was basically just cobbled together from bits and pieces of other bands that came before them, unlike true masters of rock like GnR, Megadeth or Metallica.  Plus, their songs were simple and easy to play.  Everyone knows that unless a song contains multiple key changes, minor chord progressions and syncopation, its total crap.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, songs should have lots of guitar solos in them.  Lots of them! <br /> <br />So you see, Nirvana was total crap.  They sucked.  They weren't even authentically poor.  They were probably wealthy.  If you listen to Nirvana then you are a total loser.  Go buy something else.  Go buy some Avril or some Good Charlotte.  Better yet, go check out some classics like Van Halen (Sammy Hagar era - I don't think we have to get into that other dork and his pathetic shtik).  Now there's someone that knows how to take a guitar and make it go \\"neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-diddly-diddly-doodley-doooooooooo!!!!!\\".
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Went to five stores today. The DVD was released to the public this morning, and every store had sold out by early afternoon. I knew I should have pre-ordered it on Amazon. Oh well, I for sure will do that now. Sweet.
B000062XE1|3.0|I had high expectations and they were certainly not met, especially concerning the Importance of Being Earnest.  They made it BORING.  It was lifeless, dull and DRONED for heaven's sake.  Fan, Dorian and the others are very good (especially Fan) but I was so looking forward to a good Earnest.  (I even liked the new Earnest better)  Stick to the Criterion or the new Earnest if you don't want to be let down.
B00004Z459|1.0|They should have called this CD Crappy Livejournal Music. <br />Do I even have to say anymore???
B000002C2E|5.0|People toil with the idea that Dylan may be the greatest songwriter in American music history. They put him with James Taylor or Neil Young, but I think this album proves his timelessness, it proves the fact (that some of us have known for some time now) that Dylan is infinite, Dylan is beyond it all. Dylan is Dylan.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I thought this movie was so well done.Mel Gibson's directing and the actors pull you into this movie as no other depiction of the crucifixion has been able to do.I appreciated the graphic brutality because real life is brutal.I also loved that it was so very different from everything else.I highly recommend that adults watch this.
B00005JMUL|5.0|My husband and I took our 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter to this movie and it was the most magical time we ever shared together.  This film is for the child who is 1 to 101.  After seeing this movie, I too BELIEVE!
B0000009SI|5.0|...but nothing. This album is very funny and very entertaining indeed. Instrumentally, this music is complex and intense, yet easy on the ear and laid back. Following Overnite Sensation, Zappa continues to use his Dinah-Moe Humm pimp voice in unison with non-sensical lyrics (not so much smut here as before, mind you) and certain familiar phrases crop up as well (biting poodles, ponchos etc). <br />If you have a sense of humour, appreciate musical intricacy, are not put of by wierdness and have had enough of predictable love songs, you'll love this thing. Badass guitar solos too.
B0006399FS|5.0|I'm sorry, to all those people out their expecting some grand image of what it means to be alive right now, U2 did not becon your call.  Instead, they have enlightened us as to what it means to live inside their lives, for a change.  The personal affliction, felt by Bono, diffinitly, comes through especially through all the religious controversy that is rampant throughout the album.  The album plays like a rollercoaster, which like any writer will tell you is not an easy task.  The ups and down take actual life to reproduce, and I think life has been reproduced on this album.  There is \\"nowhere\\" to go to right now.  There is no safe haven that the \\"artists have found without the rest of us,\\" therefore, I tell you as a simple soul, that if you expect some grand illusion of a new coming, a dawning of all that is new in music, you will not find it here.  Not because U2 cannot produce, but because they brought in the last age of music almost 20 years ago and to expect them to do so again is not only ludicrous, but against everything that is new, and young.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|If you like Clapton and or Robert Jonson. You will love this Dvd and CD. Looks & Sounds Super.
0440178002|4.0|At a friend's suggestion I decided to give this novel a go. I was not disappointed. It gives an excellent insight into the culture and habits of the Samurai and days gone by in Japan. The book details how two completely differing cultures (European & Japanese)misunderstand each other, are intolerant of each other but finally come to understand and respect each other, albeit guardedly. It was a wonderful read and would have received 5 stars but for the fact that it was somewhat longwinded at times. Definitely NOT to be missed!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|first of all, i am a huge metal fan...i love all the real metal all the way from iron maiden to pantera to superjoint, i love metal. Ive seen these reveiws saying these guys arent metal???? I think we are losing sight of what metal is, metal is great music(which fold has), Passionate vocals(which fold has, maybe not the greatest voice buthe uses it well for the music) and besides all metal is, is being f***ing rebellious and fold is definately rebellious... there not emo or any of theat [...] there simply a diverse band exploring metal... oh by the way [...] cd!!!!!!!!!!!
B000669GAI|5.0|For those who don't know Pearl Jam this is an excelent start album ! You won't be disappointed.  Be careful to not get addicted ! :)  But of course, it's just grit of sand of PJ's work.
B0000542D2|5.0|I am one for British humor, like Monty Python. When I saw this movie it had me in stitches, especially with John! He was completely wacky, flirty and I love the tape measuring scene. This is a must see movie for any Beatles fan. Filmed during the hype of Beatlemania. Also just as good the Yellow Submarine, though for some it will seem a little strange. You have to look at it with an artistic view to fully appreciate it. <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|I was pretty sketptical about the whole Lamb Of God talk I have being hearing since their debut album.  <br />My drummer handed me this record and my opinion is pretty much changed. <br /> <br />Like the previous efforts, this album is heavy as hell, blasting beats, growling vocals, mad guitar riffs and thundering bass lines.  <br />Aside of that, the usual wicked melodies and sometimes odd time signatured that are something typical among new death metal. <br /> <br />What this album has that the previous ones didn't was a very clean production making the album leaner and meaner than before without losing it's brutal sound.  <br />Songs like the single Laid To Rest are a perfect proof of what I am talking about. <br /> <br />Lyrically this album is still angry and powerfull, the mad screams and growls only enhance this messages under the new cleaner wall of sound which is full of really good riffs and leads. <br /> <br />All and all, it's a great metal record, their best in my opinion, and if you wanna get into American Metal, start here.
B000002N2Z|5.0|I love of all four of Deftones's albums, I just can't decide what album I like the best though...maybe it's this one, I don't know. But what you should know is that it's one mother of an album that's not for the faint hearted! Chino's voice sounds a little different than on later recordings (especially compared to their fourth) but that's okay, because that's what gives it it's personal touch and individuality than the other albums. <br /> <br />Now on to the actual review, 'Adrenaline' is absolutely jam-packed full of memorable riffs, quite-to-loud shouts 'n screams, and catchy choruses! This album set a benchmark for the band and started their career with touring with some of the biggest names in heavy music; KoRn, Pantera, Sepultura, Fear Factory etc. <br />So I guess you know right now it's gonna be a cool album! <br /> <br />Get it!
B0006399FS|5.0|For all the people knocking this album b/c it is not bold enough or experimental or whatever, so what? \\"Passengers\\" (an album put out by U2 under a pseudonym) was very bold but how many people listen to that now? Bono himself said in an interview right after Achtung Baby that he thought it was better to be good than original, and this album is a testament to that idea. The album gets better w/ each listen, and is easily the most uplifting album U2 has put out. Maybe some miss the cynicism. The exuberance of songs like \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"All Because of You\\", and \\"Yahweh\\" show an inspirational side of U2 that I really enjoy.
3822817015|5.0|This coffee table book is a good cross-section of sexy pin-up art of a bygone era that knew that showing less was more. These renderings are definitely more enticing than a lot of today's artists who don't leave anything to the imagination by showing a girl spread-eagle on the hood of a car.   <br /> <br />Definitely a \\"must-buy\\" or at least a \\"must-peruse\\" the next time you see it at a bookstore or on someone's shelves.
B00063F8B2|5.0|The movie was wonderful and the soundtrack is one of the reasons.  I am hoping the composer gets his due recognition when Oscar time comes around.<br /><br />The original music is great.  They also add the background songs that you hear in the movie when the Express reaches the North Pole.  These are old classics sung by Bing, The Andrews sisters, Perry Como and others.<br /><br />\\"Believe\\", sung by Josh Groben is amazing.  I couldn't believe that people were walking out at the end of the movie as Josh sang this song.  My family was the only ones who kept thier seats and we were in a packed theatre.  Who can walk out on Josh?<br /><br />I would make one change in the soundtrack.  I wish they had put the final song, \\"Suite from The Polar Express\\", at the end of the rest of the original music.  It is kind of out of place at the end of the classic holiday music on the CD.<br /><br />As wonderful as the movie and soundtrack are, I have one comment to make.  The movie makes it sound like believing is the most important thing.  What matters, in my opinion, is what you believe in.  Faith has to have a reason.  My faith is based on a person: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  It does matter what train you get on.  The final destination depends on it.  I do agree with the movie on this point: life is not a destination, it is a journey.  We are all waiting to arrive, when we should just be making the best of the journey.<br /><br />This movie and soundtrack are sure to become a family classic for us.  We are looking forward to owning the DVD next year.
0312995423|2.0|I know that you want to discover that Dan Brown wrote novels as great as his Da Vinci Code before he wrote the Da Vinci Code, but it just isn't so. Digital Fortress is a mess, and it makes me upset to see how the author's success with DVC is used to sell it. OK, there's a super computer, and OK, everyone's motives are questionable, but it takes forever to get to the end and at that point I didn't care whether she lived or whether the computer did a China Syndrome. Angels and Demons, while better, is not THAT much bette with hyper planes and non-fatal falls from helicopters.<br /><br />Look, all of us get better with time, and Dan Brown is no different. But don't get sucked into the feeling that you have to like all of his books: this is a stinker.
B00064VR0W|5.0|An absolute must for any Rod Stewart fan.  It is one of the best concerts I've seen.  Sound is great. Camera work is great.<BR>The venue is absolutely perfect.  The crowd is in to this concert 100 percent.  I've never written a revue before, but I noticed there were no customer reviews and I just have to tell everyone that they won't be sorry for purchasing this concert. It's worth every penny.  Even people who aren't Rod Stewart fans will love this.
B00008ADPF|1.0|What is television & radio's obsession with this band cloggin' up our time? These guys need to understand that life is nowhere near as bad as they make it out to be! Nickelback must have very poor relationships as that's all they ever seem to sing about, God, they're SO miserable! I thought we would see a new side of 'em when they released 'Feel'n Way Too Damn Good' or whatever is was called, and I was think'n \\"for the sake of their music, I hope they ARE start'n to feel good about themselves!\\". Alas, my hopes were shattered when they went back to their turgid, woe-is-me, boring chart-friendly pop rock that offers no real meaning at all! <br /> <br />Layne Staley = dead. Chad Croger = alive & well...sigh, life isn't fair...
B000063DI9|4.0|Steve Harris based the \\"7th Son of a 7th Son\\" album around the Alvin Maker series of books by Orson Scott Card, the first of which is called \\"Seventh Son.\\" Very good books, if you get the chance to read them. I don't know if Steve had the same problems he did with Frank Herbert and \\"Dune,\\" but judging from the title of the album, he probably got the green light from Card.<br /><br />I went to this concert back in 1988, I think it was called The 7th Tour of a 7th Tour. Frehley's Comet was the opening band for the show.  So as a Kiss and Iron Maiden fan, I was in heavy metal nirvana in the 4th row that night. I found the Coliseum to only be 1/2 full, which kind of surprised me in that the Somewhere on Tour tour had me sitting in the rafters. The glow seemed to be off the rose for the band and airplay had diminished to almost nothing. That being the case, I was still surprised to be sitting in a half empty 20,000 seat arena with two great bands on stage. In spite of the half empty arena, both bands put on a spectacular show.  Iron Maiden's show was particularly good; I remember them opening with my favorite track from the \\"7th Son\\" album, \\"Moonchild.\\" Everything translated very well from album to stage, and the guitar team of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray hit every note perfectly. Unfortunately, this would be Adrian's last Iron Maiden album before leaving for his solo project, ASAP.<br /><br />But now that I listen to \\"7th Son\\" again, it's not my favorite Iron Maiden album. While it's definitely good, it seemed a little less cohesive than any of the previous albums. For instance, \\"Infinite Dreams\\" and \\"Can I play With Madness\\" have some strange time changes that make the tempo shifts within the songs seem somewhat awkward and out of place. The highlights for me are \\"Moonchild,\\" and \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\\"<br /><br />While many regard this as the band's best, I would have to respectfully disagree. That honor would go to \\"The Number of the Beast\\" or \\"Piece of Mind.\\" But if you're a fan and do not have this album yet, I would make it a part of your collection.and do not have this album yet, I would make it a part of your collection.
0441172717|5.0|As Herbert would express in the latter books of this series, there are limits to words--and no review can capture \\"Dune.\\" All I can say is that this is a must-read, this is the core of Science Fiction, the pinnacle of the genre. Clarke and Asimov cannot compare, this is the definitive work of Science Fiction, and, surely, belongs on any list of the \\"greatest books\\" of our, or any time. Herbert is wise, knowledgeable and literate and lets it show. This is, surely, the most literate work of our civilization after \\"Paradise Lost\\"--something any literature person ought to take the time to enjoy.<br /><br />It would be unfair, though, not to address this books shortcomings. Herbert's writing is, at times, cut short on areas, he'll gloss over a few details or rush certain elements; or get overly-impressive when he needn't do so. He seems to be finding himself much more in this book, or, rather, finding Dune. In the later works in this series, though they themselves don't compare to Dune, he seems to have found a much better way to balance philosophy, action, narration and dialogue. The problems with this are minimal though, at worst, you may feel a little rushed by the ending, but still satisfied with the work as a whole.<br /><br />There is so much this book has to teach, so much it has to share--don't let yourself get overwhelmed, just dive into it and you'll find it to be one of the most enjoyable reading experiences you've ever had.
0780622553|5.0|Plotwise: How would you react if you woke up in a bathtub without any memories of who you are, in a place you don't know, and soon discovered that you were being sought after by police for some brutal murders?  John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) is going through this very situation.  Relentlessly persued by Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt), John reunites himself with his wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), who is struggling to make up with him after an affair John can't remember.  His only clue to his past is a postcard for Shell Beach.  But how do you get there?  Nobody seems to remember.  The reason why is revealed to John by his \\"ally,\\" Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland): the city, whose inhabitants fall asleep every midnight and which hasn't seen the light of day, is the \\"rat cage\\" of the Strangers, alien beings that share a hive mind and collective memories,  who have the power to tune (the power to alter reality and objects, but also sort of a telekinesis power), which they use to change the city every night.  Led by Mr.Book (Ian Richardson) and Mr. Hand (Richard O' Brien), the Strangers steal the inhabitant's memories, which they believe contains the human soul, and mix memories around citizens while observing the results.  But it seems that John, who resisted their attempt to imprint him (give him new memories), can now tune as well.  And he may also be the champion of humanity, destined to bring about the salvation of mankind.  If he can remember  With the help of a comprehending Bumstead, a reluctant Schreber, and an Emma wanting to make things right, John races against the Strangers to find himself...    Reviewwise: If I had to pick which of director Alex Proyas' (The Crow, Dark City, and I, Robot) is his best, I probably would say The Crow, but Dark City is not far behind.  Proyas has a flair for style over substance which shows in his films (I Robot tries to deviate from this with good results), and this is what Dark City has going for it the most. It dominates over everything, perhaps to hide the fact that the  plot is somewhat weak and not incredibly original.  This shows in the limited personalities of Dr. Schreber and Emma.  The special effects, on the other hand, are spectacular, and are more story-driven than flashy.  The sense of atmosphere is the best thing about this movie; it seems like a big experimental environment, full of dark secrets...as well as unknowing people who live life carefree.  The film feels like a comic book (an obvious influence), with its quick cuts, dramatic dialogue, and brisk pace (96 minutes).  It has its thrilling sequences (the final battle is dazzling) as well as its calmer, sensitive moments between John and Emma.  As for acting, Rufus Sewell is excellent at conveying the disorientation and subsequent understanding that Murdoch goes through.  William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly are somewhat robot-like (not so much Hurt as Connelly), but maybe that fits the setting (they have more feeling near the end).  Kiefer Sutherland's Peter Lorre-esque dialogue is kind of annoying, but you get used to it, and it's interesting to see him so vulnerable and weak, like Bruce Willis in \\"12 Monkeys\\" or Denzel Washington in \\"The Manchurian Candidate (2004)\\".  The Strangers, particularly the main ones, are good, daunting vilians, not only because they are smart and unpredictable (something most villans today aren't), but their experiment has a stronger drive than just being evil (gosh, has that ever happened in a SF movie?).  If you somehow can only buy one Alex Proyas movie, well, I don't know what to tell you, but i recommend this one over I Robot, regarding the Crow its a tough call.         On a scale of 1 to 10, this film scores a 9.  On a scale of 0.0 to 10, this film scores a 9.3.  On a scale of 0 to 100, this film scores a 93.  On a scale of 0 to 5, this film scores a 4 1/2.  On a scale of 0 to 4, this film scores a 3 1/2.    Contentwise: Dark City does have an R rating, but minus some things could easily have had a PG-13 rating.  There is some brief nudity (rear and very brief full frontal) and some kissing, but the prime factor is the film's violence, with a brief shootout and fighting with knives.  One character gets his throat cut, but nothing explicit is shown.  Some of the Strangers go down with lots of gore, but their blood looks almost tar-like, so it shouldn't bother people too much.  There is a climatic telekinetic fight at the end, but it mostly involves throwing people around, kind of like the Force Push seen in Episode I.  There is only smatterings of profanity, and what profanity is there is nothing really offensive above the d and h words.  In short, it may be rated R, but anyone 13 and up are okay to view this.
B000002MQ9|1.0|Synthesizer-heavy trash. What happened to at least the sampled bells and bodhran? And \\"In the Wake of Adversity\\" sounds like Barry Manilow circa 1257 AD.

B00005QXDD|4.0|I know I shouldn't even THINK about Tenacious D havin' a serious music career (stick to the act'n Jack, eh?) but there's only ONE thing I have a problem with this CD, and that's some of the songs that weren't released as singles are far too short. I'm not saying I think an album should have real long songs on them, but c'mon they could've at least extended some of 'em to about, let's say THREE minutes? Two 'n a half tops? Oh well, I'll stop being bitchy. To summarise, really funny album and worth the money (if you see it for a good price, that is...) Jack Black & Kyle Gass are an inspired comic duo with incredible acoustic guitar playing skills!  Flawed, but great fun to listen to!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Director:  Michael Mann <br />Cast:  Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill. <br />Rated R for lots of violence and language. <br />Running Time:  120 minutes. <br /> <br />Michael Mann, director of great films such as \\"Heat\\" and \\"The Insider\\", distributes another fine, tense thriller with \\"Collateral\\".  Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx star in extremely original roles for both:  Cruise as a bounty-hunter-like hit man who appears more like a cyborg terminator than a regular human being and Foxx as a timid cab driver who is continuously in search of his dreams. <br /> <br />While Max (Jamie Foxx) is on his routine Los Angeles cabbie job, he unfortunately picks up the fast-talking, intense Vincent (Cruise).  Vincent coerces Max to drive for him throughout the night for an extra profit, not knowing what horrific events are to unfold.  When the body of one of Vincent's victims lands on the top of car, Max realizes that this night is going to be like no other in the big city.  The strange duo drives from hit to hit, each creating more and more tension between them.  \\"Collateral\\" breezes along with crafty fashion to the electrifying climax in which Max must save a prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) from the wraith of the merciless contract killer. <br /> <br />Cruise is spectacular in his role, bringing incredible wit and savvy to his character.  Just as in \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and \\"Top Gun\\", his performance as Vincent is one that he was born to play.  Foxx delivers his second best performance of the year (behind his Oscar-worthy work in \\"Ray\\") as the John Doe bus driver who just wants a better life for himself.  As the night escalates from a regular and peaceful to tormenting and fanatical, Foxx shows the audience the transformation of this ordinary man into a hero.  Director Michael Mann does a proficient job using the city of Los Angeles throughout the film, creating beautiful pans of the eloquent buildings and roadways that add to the angst of the picture.  A splendid rogue of a film, splicing elements of \\"Taxi Driver\\", \\"The Terminator\\", and the formula for the 80's slasher flicks.  The only downfall of the film is that writer Stuart Beattie's screenplay attempts to add a layer of philosophical inquiry throughout the film (particularly one taxi scene involving both Max and Vincent), but it does not seem to quite fit.  An excellent effort of terror and suspense.  One of the most unique of its kind.  All fans of Cruise will thoroughly enjoy. <br />
B0000033P0|5.0|Any review of \\"Tarkus\\" will fail to get across just what \\"Tarkus\\" is. \\"Tarkus\\" is an experience for the ears and for the mind--there is nothing on Earth like it. The original LP of Tarkus had been a fixture around my house growing up, but I'd only bought myself the CD this year. I had forgotten just how amazing this piece was and I instantly fell in love with it. I must have listened to it twenty times the first day I got it--the \\"Tarkus\\" suite alone I probably set on repeat enough that I heard it much more than that. This piece, to quote another ELP song has got, \\"thrills and shocks.\\" There is nothing like it, the only musical experience that can rival it is \\"Karn Evil 9.\\"<br /><br />If I may also add, don't limit yourself to this CD. The live recordings of ELP have great preformances of these songs and \\"Tarkus\\"--futher enriched by Greg Lake's inclusion of King Crimson's \\"Epitaph\\" into it. I was also blessed with the privelige of seeing the Keith Emerson Band preform \\"Tarkus\\" over Halloween of 2004 and this really capped my \\"Tarkus\\" cake. Go out there, buy this CD, experience it and the music off it in every way possible. You will find yourself rewarded immensely.
0790742780|5.0|Sure, Joel Schumacher is billed for his well-established reputation for sensationalism. However, this movie, if anything, comes across as unusually subtle. For anyone who's watched it, I will need to carefully qualify this term. I call it subtle because it is NOT the rampage some reviewers have called it; the \\"bloody swath\\" Bill Foster (Michael Douglas) cuts across L.A. is not so much a bloody swath as a directed and thematically-appropriate, if a bit incongruous, set of discrete encounters with various \\"problem areas\\" in society. The movie is NOT gorey. Stereotypes do abound, but they are poignant and intentional. A viewer less prone to contemplation may perhaps view this as a man standing up for \\"right\\" and \\"good\\" in America, and as such, the movie manifests some undesirable, unjustifiable stereotypes. However, upon further reflection, a clear implication on behalf of the screenwriter is that in many cases, the problem is as much with Bill Foster as it is with the person he encounters. All sorts of fundamental social problems America faces are torn wide open here; all of the violence and all of the stereotypes presented are all there to serve a purpose. <br /> <br />That having been said, understand that this movie isn't completely plausible. It is not meant to be. You wonder if Bill Foster is going absolutely insane, or if he's the only sane person he encounters. There are moments when he appears to manifest an outrageous sanity that flies in the face of established social norms. The kinds of issues confronted throughout the movie couldn't be treated so cleverly in a movie any more \\"reality-based\\" or any more sensationalistic. <br /> <br />Lastly, the lead acting - Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall - is phenomenal, virtually legendary. The supporting cast is less remarkable. Luckily, we spend about 90% of our time with these two lead actors. They act with sincerity and conviction, and, in reality, make the movie GOOD. With any lesser of a performance in these twolead roles (Bill Foster / Officer Prendergast), the movie may have been flat. It is instead an engaging, meaning-laden powerhouse. <br /> <br />I must encourage everyone to watch this movie, to FACE it, to pay attention, to acknowledge it, and where something seems flagrant, unnecessary, or out of place, read deeper!
0070511136|5.0|SPIN Selling was first written in 1988. I first read it this year. It is as relevant today as the day it was written. You would think that by now every salesperson out there would know that SPIN works, but apparently there are a lot of people in sales who aren't interested in improving their skills. <br /> <br />I've practiced the principles, and they work.  I, like many sales people, are very used to giving information. A typical sales call often involves giving details about your product or service until your prospect's eyes glaze over (not your intent, of course). What SPIN is really about is creating interest. Its about using questions to softly lead the prospect to a conclusion using their own thought process, rather than just telling them. <br /> <br />What surprises me it that it is so difficult. Don't be one of those salespeople who reads every sales book out there but doesn't practice any of the ideas! I guarantee if you practice these questioning techniques, you will improve your sales.
B000002UUX|5.0|Dave Mustaine is a fine guitarist, known for being in Metallica for a year giving them a kick start to their underground metal career. And then later replaced by Kirk Hammet, since then Mustaine has been given the reputation of being one big moany loudmouth, constantly claiming he was cheated by the 'tallica boys and kicked out without so much as a warning. Yeah we all know the story, but what made Megadeth so compelling was the fact that not many ex-members of, well, ANYTHING usually become huge music icons no matter the genre your interested in. <br />When the band released 'Peace Sells...' they earned a huge loyal fanbase considering the band's very fine style of heavy music. But the icing on the cake was this album 'Rust In Peace' no question. <br />I mean, what can you say about this album, just the fact it's incredible and record breaking in the speed riffing derpartment, not only that but Mustaine's voice is unbelievably fast & angry, try tracks like 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due', 'Take No Prisoners', 'Poison Was The Cure', 'Tornado Of Souls', & 'Dawn Patrol' and you'll know what I mean. <br />David Ellefson's bass playing is right on target! Marty Friedman knows how to shred old school style! And Nick Menza's drumming is too very powerful! <br />If you are interested in this, then I suggest you look into the legendary Megadeth's latest album 'The System Has Failed' it rules! Anyone who doesn't appreciate the quality of this album NEEDS to see a doctor! <br /> <br />Bye for now...
B00005A46T|5.0|This has to be the heaviest of the slipknot albums.  Not too much to say other then it is brutaliy heavy, insane and addicting. <br /> <br />Stand outs are: <br />People=S*** <br />My plague <br />The Heretic Anthemn <br />Left Behind <br />Metabolic
B00005JNDZ|2.0|The original Bridget Jones' Diary committed so many Book-To-Film conversion crimes that it's impossible to know where to begin - it changed events, omitted things, cast an American in the role of British Poster Girl for Singletons, etc - but for all of that, it was an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable movie, full of the same kind of bittersweet humour and zany slapstick that has made the novel such a seminal classic. <br /> <br />The book \\"Edge of Reason\\", while perhaps not in the same league as the original, is still an excellent read, and Helen Fielding's wry observationism and witty sarcasm are as vibrant as ever before. Sad, then, that this movie adaptation of that novel lacks almost all of the warmth and wit of the book, replacing it instead with schmaltz and tired stereotyping, histrionic set-pieces and truly predictable comedy. <br /> <br />Bridget is now in a relationship with Mark Darcey and the Daniel Cleaver affair seems to be well and truly behind her. Her career is going well and her friends are jealous. So far, so good. Suddenly, she and Mark break up, she and Daniel are sent to Thailand together, she's framed for cocaine smuggling, and unless her friend Shazzer can alert Mark in time, it'll all end in tears. <br /> <br />Except after the first thirty minutes or so, the sugary sweetness and blind mundanity of the movie we just don't care how it ends. <br /> <br />Zellwegger's accent and performance mannerisms are once more flawless in their British impersonation, and she does what she can with a truly uninspiring script. Firth as Mark Darcey is the same as before, except now almost totally one-dimensional, lacking any of the depth of either the novel or the original movie. Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver is now a totally transparent character, and the movie-invented TV show he hosts does not serve any purpose other than to showcase his soullessness - a trait which we were already well aware of, why underline it here? - and at the movie's end we do find ourselves wondering what the point of including him in the screenplay was. <br /> <br />Not that these are bad actors, you understand - this is the fault of a lousy script that relies far too heavily on schmaltzy emotion and a gross underestimation of the audiences' intelligence levels. Devoid of all subtlety and warmth, the movie  rattles on to a cheesy and predictable close, but by that stage, you may well have switched off before the inexorable happy ending. <br /> <br />One to avoid, read the novel instead.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|I  like this movie and the only reason why I like it is because of the dancing and the soundtrack.  Other than that, the movie was just too cheesy and unrealistic for me. Although the movie tries to portray itself as deep by taking place in the 'hood, it just doesn't work. Alba's character (Honey) is bubbly and positive, which are good character traits. But her personality just doesn't fit in at all with the grimy inner city atmosphere of New York City.  The acting in the movie wasn't even that great. It was very amateurish except when it came to Lonette McKee and Mekhi Phifer. Lil' Romeo can't act to save his life and he can't dance either. Most of his dance moves looked like they were copied from one of Bow Wow's videos.  I give credit to Jessica for performing her own dance moves instead of using a body double like Jennifer Beals did for 'Flashdance.' I've heard a rumor that Aaliyah was supposed to be casted as 'Honey Daniels', but I agree with the other reviewer that Mya should've been the first choice for this film.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Some of the reviews on here seem to focus more on Michael's personal life than on his music.  Are we so removed from reality that we now believe every word in tabloids and no longer believe in the pleasure that beautiful music can bring?  Shame on you people for believing such garbage and allowing yourselves to be so controlled by the media.  Wouldn't it be easier to just give the music a chance?  I guarantee that anyone who listened to the songs and watched the dvd in this box set would be amazed at Michael's brilliance.  There has never been anyone with such talent and genius as Michael Jackson.  There is no one ever who could captivate an audience like Michael does on the live concert dvd. This box set highlights a wonderful career which is far from over!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Hey kids! You like faux-grunge with plenty of below-average lyrics about broken relationships and high school years? Then get this! You'll regret it when you're all reached the age of 18 though but still, hey, time makes fools of us all! <br />Okay sure, she has a good voice, but there's nothing new here people!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This is slipknot's least brutal album thus far.  Although it is not as heavy as the nine man metal army's previous releases, it shows a much more creative side to the band.  When i first got this album it was the only thing in mey cd player for about a week.   <br />The best tracks on this album are: <br />THE BLISTER EXISTS <br />THREE NIL <br />WELCOME <br />BEFORE I FORGET <br /> <br />Harcore fans of the first two slipknot albums may be disappointed with this one, but fans of stone sour may really enjoy it because it is much softer then the first two.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has finally come back and released their first new album since 2000. And they couldn't have done it any better. Their daring Punk Rock Opera \\"American Idiot\\" features the rocking headline track American Idiot, the amazing Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and the headbanging Give Me Novacaine. The album sets the standard for punk rock in a way never thought possible.
B000069HK2|5.0|This album is very good, I love it, I personally like it better then their new CD, In Love and Death, but both are definently worth getting. <br /> <br />Track 1 - Maybe Memories <br />I like this song, its a good start to the CD and Bert's vocals are awesome. Its one of the harder songs on the album by a little. Theres some screaming parts \\"im not going to look back!!!\\", and some parts where Bert's voice really stands out \\"glittering wax butterflies...\\" This is a great song by The Used and I'm glad they made it the title of their DVD/CD set. <br />RATING - 10/10 <br /> <br />Track 2 - The Taste of Ink <br />One of those songs that you might not like at first... but it becomes very catchy later, and now I love it. One of my favorite parts is the chorus. Its a good song overall, and an okay single, but theres better. <br />RATING - 8/10 <br /> <br />Track 3 - Bulimic <br />Another song I love... its not a very hard song, but I love the vocals and especially the chorus. I also like how Bert screams the chorus towards the end, its a good ending to the song, and a good transition to Say Days Ago. A good song IMO... <br />RATING - 9/10 <br /> <br />Track 4 - Say Days Ago <br />The intro to this song is great, for some reason I really like it and its addicting. The drums sound really good here. The lyrics and singing of the verse could be a bit better, but it still fits the song and the music nicely. One of my favorite songs on the album. <br />RATING - 9/10 <br /> <br />Track 5 - Poetic Tragedy <br />One of the much softer songs by The Used, but thats not a bad thing. This song really shows how high Bert's voice can go. Not the best song, but its not bad either and its worth listening to. <br />RATING - 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Track 6 - Buried Myself Alive <br />This is the first song I heard by The Used. To tell you the truth, I didn't like it at first, and I didn't like it until I started listening to some of their other stuff. Its actually grown on me a lot now, and I love singing along to it. The lyrics are actually good too if you listen to them. <br />RATING - 8/10 <br /> <br />Track 7 - A Box Full Of Sharp Objects <br />One of my favorite songs by The Used, the guitar rocks, the lyrics rocks, and Bert rocks. I also like the screamo part where the guitar stops and the bass gets really low. This is a really good overall song and it shows the harder side of The Used. <br />RATING - 10/10 <br /> <br />Track 8 - Blue and Yellow <br />A softer song by The Used... but that isn't bad at all. I love this song to death and its one of the best on their album. I like how Bert's voice is soft at some of the parts in this song, and the vocals sound really nice throughout the song. You might not appreciate this song at first, but it really is great. <br />RATING - 10/10 <br /> <br />Track 9 - Greener With the Scenery <br />This song isnt anything really special, but its still a good song. I like the chorus and pre-chorus parts the most, but the rest of this song doesn't stand out a whole lot. <br />RATING - 8/10 <br /> <br />Track 10 - Noise and Kisses <br />Another pretty good song, I like Bert's voice a lot, like usual. It stands out a long in this song, and the high parts fit the song nicely actually. I like how the chorus is sung in two different tones throughout the song. <br />RATING - 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Track 11 - On My Own <br />An awesome song, the only accoustic on the album. Yet another song that shows that The Used doesn't have to be screaming or blasting out power chords to totally rock. Bert's voice sounds really nice in this, and it shows the band's true talent. A great addition to the album. <br />RATING - 10/10 <br /> <br />Track 12 - Pieces Mended <br />A good last track to the song. I like the guitar, and the piano outro. Some of the parts are wierd with the breathing and stuff, but its a good end to the album not counting the secret track. <br />RATING - 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Secret Track - Choke Me <br />A really hard track, the secret track on the album. This song might freak you out the first couple times you listen to it, but its actually not too bad. Not the best... It has some wierd lyrics, but its okay. <br />RATING - 8/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this CD is really good and worth picking up if you like this kind of music. Its an overall strong album and definently worth listening to at least. <br />FINAL RATING - 9.5/10
B00008J4P5|5.0|When I first turned on this album, I knew I had found a gem of an album. The first song, Seven Nation Army, is the kind of song that sticks in your head for a long time with its awesome walking bass line and guitar hooks. The rest of the album had a lot of variety in its sound. Each song tries a different style of rock. 'Black Math', for example, has a grungy sound to it, while 'There's No Home For You Here' has such awesome guitar hooks in it, if you don't find your head moving, you need to see a doctor. The song Little Acorns uses an anecdote about squirrels to get your attention, then busts out in a grungy guitar part sometimes reminiscent of Nirvana. It is very unique in its own way, as is the whole album. Overall, the guitar hooks in combination with awesome bass parts make this album a personal favorite. Every song is awesome! If you remotely like rock, you need to pick this album up ASAP.
B00006F83Y|4.0|It's a shame the other members of Queens left Josh Homme earlier this year, but this is still a good album. <br />Wouldn't say it's a classic, but that's just my opinion, the most energetic song here is 'You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar...' considering it's the opening track what would you expect? <br />'No One Knows', the most popular Q.O.T.S.A song to this day still, is too one of my favourites. I feel that maybe Dave Grohl would've had something to do with the album's change of pace in sound and in style, but Dave's a cool man and a great drummer so I can accept that easily. <br />A highly enjoyable album.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot was the first heavy band i got into.  And this album is pretty heavy.  A lot of people think of slipknot as nu-metal, but i don't see how.  They sound nothing like nu-metal bands, and they are heavier then some underground bands i know. <br />This is an amazing debut by the nine man metal army know as slipknot. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks are: <br />(Sic) <br />Eyeless <br />wait and bleed <br />Spit it out <br />Diluted <br /> <br />Pick this one up if you want some insanly fun metal to listen to.
068987474X|1.0|Not much need to read the book if you've read the title. The author states it outright: men are not that complicated...but then we knew that all along. Food, sleep, sex and sports -- what else do they need?  <br /> <br />Behrendt tries to soften the blow with continual assurances that we are hot, pretty and deserve someone better. He's right about that, too, and if we stop giving it up for men who don't deserve us, it's more likely that we will find someone who does. So when men are no longer getting sex, they will have Behrendt to thank for it.

He does real goo in Iron Flag and The W.  This is the best CD of all time.  It has over 20 great tracks, not just good, but great.  Half of these songs were instant classics in my ears.
B000065V42|1.0|Jesus, what is wrong with you people, how in any shape or form can you call this a good movie? This film was trying to be cutting edge what with all the corny special effects and it's intentions to be different than most family films, but failed BADLY! <br />Should've been called 'Honey I made a terrible film!'
B000092ZYX|5.0|this album is a good synthesis of kid a and ok computer while at the same time experimenting with the conglomeration of genres that radiohead may not have tried before.(similar to the glass house song on amnesiac) i think for the most part  it is very successful. it took a few listens for it to become what i think is their best album to date. but with each new listen i find new facets to songs that add to what i believe to be a strongly crafted and aurally pleasing album.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album contains all the divine emotions that mankind can ever hope to exhibit:  joy, love, pain, pathos, celebration.  No work of art has spoken so completely to and of the human spirit since the times of Pericles; indeed, this album is the Parthenon of our era, if not of all time.
B0002YLC24|4.0|I was recommended to see this movie by a woman with whom we have a story that is much like this one, even better. This movie was really about a story that's much like ours! We met about two years ago in a third country and since then a strange spiritual connection developed between us.<br /><br />The reason that I give only four stars is that because the film had a very short introduction into the theme. It started at once with Jesse having his interview about his new book.
0156027321|2.0|'My suffering left me sad and gloomy.'  As opposed to what?  'My suffering left me happy and elated?'  Yann Martel's second book reveals undisputed mastery of the obvious.  Carnivores eat other animals.  Physical and emotional suffering are unpleasant.  Religions contradict each other, and sometimes contradict themselves.  Academia can be a metaphor for religion, and vice-versa.   Cannibalism is bad.  Is any of this news?  I forced myself to slog through to the last page, operating on the presumption that there must be something hiding in there somewhere.  There isn't.  I've seen so many glowing superlatives used to describe this book.  Fun.  Airy.  Spiritual.  Delightful.  Revelatory.  I'd like to add a few of my own.  Pretentious.  Shallow.  Dull.  Derivative.  I give it 2 stars because the idea of a boy stranded on a raft with a tiger has at least a shred of originality.  I speak strictly of the idea.  There's not anything particularly original about the author's handling of the idea.  Were it not for that single saving grace, I'd give it 1 star.  It probably doesn't even deserve that.  I'll end with my own rewrite of Martel's opening...  This book left me sad and gloomy.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Amidst swinging London, students painted their faces white in order to fundraise, and weed was easily obtainable.  Pleasure seemed to be sought in every corner, as Puritanical values once had held down the societal freedom to express self, while a new bohemian period was emerging.  Philosophy in regards to everything was pondered as nudity emerged as an art form as well as an exploitation.  French New Wave had already influenced the world as had the dreamy visions of Fellini, psychosocial introspection of Bergman, and philosophy behind human choices in Antonioni's films such as L' Avventura (1960).  The world was about to explode into a colorful spectacle as artistic freedom and expression were pushing the boundaries of censorship and moral value.  In the middle of the cultural anarchy, a story about a photographer helped pushing the boundaries, which was one of the milestones that was needed for artists and alike as they sought true freedom.<br /><br />Blow-Up focuses on what is within each frame of each scene, which is also how the film's hero, Thomas (David Hemmings), sees the world.  Thomas is a successful photographer, in a monetary way, as he drives a Rolls Royce convertible, donates money, has a big studio, and has several photo shoots with beautiful models.  Yet, Thomas does not like the job as a model photographer, as many of his models seem to be oblivious to what he is trying to accomplish while capturing the aesthetics of the moment.  The photographic moment must be caught as if the camera was not there, however, it seems as if many models lack this knowledge or understanding.  This ignorance comes across as an insult to Thomas whenever someone stands in front of his camera, which seems to put him in a severely bad mood.  Nonetheless, he lives to see what he captures through the lens as he brings the camera wherever he travels.<br /><br />There are a selected few models that know how to pose properly for Thomas in order to create an aesthetically emotional moment that enhances the texture of the image, which Thomas attempts to capture.  In the beginning of the film Thomas returns to his studio dressed in rags while a stunning model is waiting for the photo shoot with him.  The model is barely dressed--just enough to cover up her personal parts.  Thomas begins the shoot as the model moves seductively and he is slowly drawn to her, as seaman would to the singing of a siren.  Closer and closer Thomas gets until they seem to merge into one.  The scene is very suggestive in a sexual manner, which seems to please both.  The model effortlessly repositions herself in enticing manners as Thomas provides her with admiring comments that urges her to continue with her visual seduction through the lens.<br /><br />Thomas' true passion for his profession is to capture the present time where the truth is revealed, which is done in all places of life.  The truth seems to be the way a person genuinely appears in solitude.  Thus, a voyeuristic portion of Thomas appears as he seeks to see the world the way it is without him being present.  An early morning Thomas ventures to see his agent, but stops by an antique store.  Nearby the small antique store there is a small path that leads to a park where he discovers a couple, a woman and an older man.  The couple appears to be of some sort of relation to one another, yet it is difficult to see exactly what the couple is doing.  They could be hugging and kissing, yet they could be arguing.  Thomas takes cover by trees and bush while he captures the ambiguous moment with his camera.  The true nature of the couple will be revealed later through the photos that Thomas develops in his darkroom.<br /><br />Symbiosis seems to exist between Thomas and the camera as Thomas seems to need the camera as the camera needs him in order to be used.  There is an emotional distance between Thomas and reality as the camera seems to be the boundary of moral judgment.  The camera offers him an opportunity toobserve the world at a safe distance, yet he can partake in what he sees.  The safety truly appears when the audience notices the difference between when the picture was taken and when the picture is viewed, as time and place change and leave him at a safe distance from the truth.  Time and place appear to be the divider that is provided to Thomas through the camera, which offers him a safe role in his photographic society without responsibilities, or guilt.  It also offers him the opportunity to relive a moment, or an experience.  Similar notion could be drawn to the experiences that the audience can revive in many museums throughout the world where emotions such as desire, fear, sadness, happiness, joy, and more seem to be trapped in time and place.<br /><br />Michelangelo Antonioni does a marvelous job directing as each scene offers something for the audience to ponder.  Compared to L' Avventura (1960) Blow-Up provides a similar drifty theme, which at times seems to wander aimlessly.  Nonetheless, the context in which Blow-Up takes place is unique and despite its directionless touch most scenes seem to be perfectly choreographed together with the outwardly meticulous mise-en-scene.  This provides a sense of natural beauty that Antonioni captures through the camera.  In addition, the natural beauty offers the concept that there is beauty everywhere, and it most certainly surrounds all viewers too, which should be captured and revived when needed.  Blow-Up offers a truly artistic perspective, which could be found tedious for many, however, it is what encourages the processes of contemplation as Thomas is devoured by his passion.  Thus, let the artists have their freedom as the audience longs to experience the stored sentiments, which offers morals and enlightening lessons.tunity to observe the world at a safe distance, yet he can partake in what he sees.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Everyone knows someone like Napolean.  This movie is not for those that don't understand subtlety.  This movie is for anyone that hates the typical Hollywood genre films.  This movie is flippin' funny.  This movie is for anyone that's hunted wolverines in Alaska with a frickin' 12-guage . . . Gosh!!
B00005JMAH|4.0|Slightly disappointed with this film.  Although a darker story, it failed to capture the essence of Harry Potter that was so well done in the first two films.  As this was my least favourite book, I should not be too disappointed I guess.  Hogwarts looked too different from the first two films, and that made a big difference in the overall feel of the movie for mine.  I though Dumbledore was also mis cast. I know Richard Harris is a hard act to follow, but they really needed someone with \\" presence\\".  But hey, they have done so well with casting so far, I guess they can be forgiven!  Overall the movie was executed well, particuarly the marauders map and the Hogsmead village.  However the warmth, spark and magic from the earlier movies seemed to missing- all these reveiwers who mentioned this can't be wrong!!  Good points: Alan Rickman continues his superb role as Professor Snape, and Emma Thompson does a wonderful job as the new Divination Professor.  Robbie Coltrane is brilliant as always as Hagrid.  I look forward to the next one with interest.    Worth a good look or two!
B00030590I|2.0|I saw an asian import of this movie on DVD about the same time it was hitting the theatres in Denver. Other than the fact that all of the menus were in chinese and I had to follow pretty odd instructions to get english subtitles, I was impressed with the underlying message of the movie. I also thought the use of color shifting really added to the whole experience.  <br /> <br />I just got the american version of the DVD this week and the subtitles SUCK. They completely changed meanings every chance they had and the finished product looks NOTHING like the movie that originally caught my univided attention.  <br /> <br />I hope Miramax NEVER chops another chinese movie. If you don't mind a little extra work for a much better version, find the import.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I love this CD it rock's! But I gave it a 4 star review last time and this time I must put my real feelngs for this CD. I love metal it's cool and it ....... rocks? Laid To Rest is the shizzitt and it F*@$ing blows slipknot right outuftha wata', yo! The guitar's by the way dont sound crappy you stupid retards the guitars on this cd rock me downtown! The singing is awesome and very creative! Anyway's you stinky fat lazy bum's go and get this album it is the bomb! if you dont get it you suck! and remember Kiddies RAP IS CRAP!!!!
B000002B7U|1.0|This album is a complete disaster.  All the songs on here suck.  The best song is Shot in the Dark, which I would only give a 2/5. (The rest of the songs recieve 1/5) I guess if you like Shot in The Dark this album is for you.  Just remember I warned you, don't waste your hard earned cash.  Whenever I want to listen to Ozzy,  I'll stick with Diary of a Madman.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Now I've had a chance to see this again, I'll review this again. It's is definitley better after a second viewing, although I still found it not as good as the first two. I must say on the positive side, the costumes, sets and effects were second to none. The CG scenes are unbelievable. How did they manage to do all that?!!  I wish some of the questions were answered better in this movie, but the action scenes alone make up for that.  A great series of movies that must surely have \\" cult \\" status already
B00006690G|5.0|I loved this CD. I keep playing it over and over again even though it's 2 years old. Every single song on the CD is good except for \\"Soldier\\". Each song has awesome beats and clever rhymes. Particularly good songs are \\"Superman\\", \\"Sing For The Moment\\", and \\"White America\\".
B0002BO0AS|5.0|A few monthes ago I wrote a stupid review saying that this was a bad CD! I feel like an idiot! I wish I didn't say that stuff about this good band because that's what these guy's are a good band! Wow was I wrong, This album rocks!!! I would have to say that I really wasnt into the style back when I gave that horrible reveiw and now I'am into the style of this Hardcore stuff! The guitars, the singing, etc. I think that this group put a lot of effort into such a small record label CD. That's good because that means they have ambition and what not! But my point is is that you shouldnt judge a band by how popular theyre record label is. Now onto this awesome album. Right when you hear the opening on \\" The Great Dividers \\" you know that this album is going to be brutal and it is! The Guitar work on this album was a bit complex(for me) but not that hard. All the songs are brutal and heavy & awesome. The best track is \\"The Great Dividers\\" it's probably the heaviest song on the CD. The only problem I had with this album was that on \\"Aries\\" the singer (Trevor Phipps) screams and that is a very soft, slow song. I still like the song but it's a little strange if you have screaming in a soft song. This album was a 10/10 after more listens for me. This CD is awesome trust me!
B000002UJQ|1.0|Sorry, but I do not get this band. Back in 1993 Radiohead had a wonderful song called Creep. It was beautiful, raw, emotional, and heartfelt. And then they got weird. They went art rock noise or minimalist tinkering and everything that they have put out since has been boring, bland, mindless, dull, painful, and uninspired. They have legions of fans, but I'm sorry. I just do not see (hear) it. I still have my original copy of Pablo Honey that I quit playing once I ripped Creep and stored in on my pc, ipod, and cd-r for the car. They throw a mess together and put it out there. Then people come along and call this garbage \\"art\\". Sorry, but its garbage. It's too slow, the songs don't go anywhere, and it skitters and groans, the lead singer has forgotten how to sing. It's like someone came along and sucked all the emotion out of the band after the made Creep.  <br /> <br />I quit buying their cd's after The Bends and now I just download their albums as they come out. I give it a fair try and come away disappointed. They had such promise with their first album, but they wasted it.  <br />
B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars continues to break new ground, and what this film lacks in story and stupid characters- Jar Jar, it makes up for in Special effects and new ideas. <br />I thought the light sabre scenes were fresh and interesting. <br />The pod-racing was awesome, and the Jedi training area most interesting. <br />The casting was on the whole pretty good, with Ewen MacGregor and Liam Neeson stealing the day. <br />The extra scenes and stories that come with the DVD version are also very interesting and gives one more insight into the philosiphy behind behind the story. <br />Still a great, if not brilliant movie, and will keep you entertained for a couple of hours! <br />
B000002USN|5.0|I used to think Sinatra was just for my parents and their generation.  How wrong I was!  Just listening to all these young artists such a Luis Miguel, Bono, Jobim, Willie Nelson, Julio Iglesias, Luther Vandross, etc. etc. etc., having the privilege to sing along Ol'Blue Eyes is just wonderful.  Not only the arrangements make these songs sound more contemporary, but appealing to the younger generation.  Just ck Mack the Knife... awesome.  Fly me to the Moon...Incomparable.  I listen to both of these discs while I drive to work and enjoy them tremendously!!!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|I just received the latest Tom Cruise Action Pack, which includes the Widescreen Special Collector's Edition of Top Gun.  If you have a new home theater system and are looking for a movie that will demonstrate its capabilities, this is the one! <br /> <br />  The picture quality is great, especially when one considers this movie was originally shot in the mid '80s.  But, the real item of note is the soundtrack.  As of this posting, Amazon has the DTS soundtrack listed as 5.1, but the English DTS soundtrack is actually a discrete 6.1!  Ever wonder what it would sound like if a fighter jet flew through your living room?
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of the best comedies to come out in recent years (and is in the running for one of the best comedies of all-time).  It is a teen film that manages to be utterly hilarious without all of the clich&eacute;s of teen movies nowadays, and this is wonderfully refreshing to see in cinema.  The jokes aren't stale and the dialogue is witty, and it's a good-natured film at heart.  The viewer feels for too cool Napoleon while at the same time laughing at his hilarious antics.  The supporting cast of the film is amazing, too.  It's PG.  It's witty.  It's refreshing.  Maybe filmmakers should take note that it doesn't take cussing and sexuality to make an interesting film.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Thanks for reading. <br />This is one of those rare films that outdoes the original- just! <br />The story deepens, the amazing effects, costumes and sets are there, and in the end this movie poses more questions than it answers. <br />It leaves you hanging at the end, where you think... What the? What could....? What if....? <br />Sadly, I have seen the last film and it was a dissapointment. But, I prefer to watch this one, and then make up my own 3rd film in my head with my own ideas! <br />Easy to get lost in this movie- and forget about what's going on around you. <br />Another great Sci-Fi film that really is a must see for all action, sci-fi , Police or martial arts buffs. <br />
B00064AM6C|3.0|OK, to start off with, I have to say that I am a HUGE fan of the White Stripes. What I hear in this video is nothing less than what is expected of these two incredible musicians. The problem is with the editing.<br /><br />Get past the grainy video. I've done plenty videos of live concerts, and even with all the gadgets available it still is difficult to pull a good crisp image from a distance of a band performing live. My biggest problem with this vid is that it was totally expected. Fast quick shots jumping from different angles and not giving the viewer much of an experience of the characters.<br /><br />What is it with contemporary video editors? Can they get it through their thick skull that there are people who would really like to see static or extended shots of the performers doing what they do best? (play)<br /><br />I certainly can't dog this video, because the music generates the flavor of the duo, however it comes to mind that this disc could be played without the video and be equally enjoyable. (Hmm, sounds more like a cd to me)<br /><br />Regardless, if you are a big WS fan I still highly recommend you get this cut. Just don't expect to see any of gritty profiles and expessions of Jack or Meg for anything more than 3 seconds. Too bad, because we all love watching them express their music.
B00008YLV2|5.0|My title is in response to another's offmark summary of the movie.  The movie (while not totally accurate - read the book) is not a racist movie but a true depiction of the facts.  The movie tastefully avoided the true gruesome pictures we all saw on magazine covers of the savages dragging a naked soldier through the streets of Somalia. Should we have put that into the movie?  For those of you who want to see an excellent movie based on facts, watch this movie.  I believe that we forgot about these men who risked their lives in order to bring stability to a 3rd world country full of corruption and genocide.  There is a lot of action & blood in this movie but if you read the books written by the soldiers who served in this battle, the movie is a child's version of the facts.  It's definitely up there with the best of the \\"war\\" movies - another great web site depicts actual radio futage and photos of the scene.  It was put up by the Phila Inquirer & is worth seeing - great futage, photos, Q&A.
B00000K19E|5.0|Thanks for reading. <br />It's hard to be really different in movie making, but boy, didn't they turn a few heads in the late 90s when this one came out? <br />A really different story line, and totally new ideas for special effects insured that this would become one of the biggest movies to come out in recent years. <br />The martial art scenes are the most innovative to come out since the Bruce Lee movies from the 70s. <br />The sets are impressive, the special effects mind- boggling. <br />A must see for all fans of the following genres- action, martial arts, police or sci-fi. <br />Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is superb. Wonderful dry humour. Keano Reeves plays Neo to perfection. <br />In fact the casting is top notch all the way. <br />The sense of paranoia and desperation, not to mention the feeling \\"Big Brother\\" is watching, is ever present throughout the film. <br />I think that's what gives this film an intense feeling, in which you are totally lost in the story. <br /> <br />An amazing movie really, repeat viewings a must, as it's hard to take in, in just one sitting. <br /> <br />Classic Action Sci-Fi- a must see! <br /> <br />
B000065V1V|5.0|This is a great album. I didn't realize how good it was at first because it's so understated but upon repeated listens it has grown on me so much. He has brought back his old producer Tony Visconti, and the sound is just amazing! He also has David Grohl playing guitar on Neil Young's \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" and Pete Townshend sounding like a cross between Jimi Hendrix & Robert Fripp on another song. He also covers a Pixies song. Plus there's a 4 song bonus disk that includes a demo of \\"Panic In Detroit\\".
B00005MKA1|5.0|\\"Kaya\\" was Bob Marley's soft, beautiful, and melodic follow up to the \\"Exodus\\" album of 1977.  Released in 1978, \\"Kaya\\" was meant to coidncide with the One Love Peace Concert held in April of that year.  While \\"Rastaman Vibration,\\" and to a greater extent, \\"Exodus,\\" were fiercly sociopolitical and religious, \\"Kaya\\" dealt more with homage to the power of ganja (marijuana) and romantic love.  One thing \\"Kaya\\" and \\"Exodus\\" do have in common is the strong spirituality, but \\"Kaya\\" takes this in a softer direction. The album even sparked Bob Marley & the Wailers' first World Tour, some of which can be heard on the live \\"Babylon By Bus\\" album released later that year. <br /> <br />Each song is a classic, from the slow and steady \\"Easy Skanking,\\" to the soothing \\"Time Will Tell\\".  Some of the most notable tracks on the album are the tracks \\"Is This Love\\" and \\"Satisfy My Soul\\" both featured on the \\"Legend\\" compilation.  Another is the remake of the roots classic \\"Sun Is Shining,\\" originally done with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh in the late 60's-early 70's as was the title track \\"Kaya\\" (meaning \\"marijuana\\"), an ode to the herb used so reverently by Marley in his lifetime.  Two very key songs speak of the assassination attempt aimed at him in 1976: the dark and somber \\"Running Away,\\" and the forgiving, spiritual \\"Time Will Tell\\".  Finally, the bonus track \\"Smile Jamaica [Version]\\" is a danceable classic, showing the lighter and more playful side of Marley's music.  This album is sure to delight every fan with each song again and again.
B00000I924|5.0|While most, if not all, of his contemporaries (I won't call them peers 'cause they aint!) seem to wallow in the old techniques that got them there, El Becko soars above them all by constantly evolving and making music that reflect the times. I was so happy with this album. It was worth the wait. Then he follows with You had it coming and Jeff. Kind of a trilogy of Guitar Terror. And all PHENOMINAL. As an aside I was sitting there watching \\"It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World\\" (old movie.If you don't know it...rent or buy it). This album had just come out and while watching the flick one of the characters (Dick Shawn) utters the words \\"Y'all Hear What Mama Said?!\\"...yes the same sample used in the song! I nearly fell over. I was lucky enough to meet Jeff Beck back stage during his Austin show shortly thereafter and mentioned that I knew where the sample came from. When he found out I knew...all he wanted to do was talk about the movie. Apparently it is one of his all time faves. What a great Bloke!
B000062YAZ|2.0|If anyone knows anything about music theory you can plainly see that Kerry King's solos are so horribly out of chord that it makes the notes painful to hear. King has the talent to go off but not the talent to write good music. Other than that Slayer has their own style and if you like their style you will like it but i dont see how anyone could every say that Kerry King is good musician.....thats a joke.
B000002UEB|5.0|We're not talking about just any album here. We're talking about Queensryche's 'tour de force', their 'magnum opus' or any other cliche that denotes sheer perfection. Yes we're talking about Operation: Mindcrime, not only Queensryche's zenith, considered by many as the apogee of concept albums and heavy metal in general. Basically we're talking about progressive metal nirvana.<br /><br />There is a reason that the preponderance of reviewers give Operation: Mindcrime five stars. When it comes to concept albums, it is the standard to which all concept albums are compared, it has no peers. Heck I do it myself, stacking other very good concept albums against the incomparable Operation: Mindcrime.<br /><br />What is a concept album? It is simply an album where each song revolves around a single concept or story.<br /><br />In only their second album, Queensryche scored their breakthrough success with this most ambitious concept album, Operation: Mindcrime, which tells the story of an anarchist whose disillusionment with Reagan-era American society leads him to join a shadowy plot to assassinate corrupt leaders. The band plays fabulously and Geoff Tate does both a great acting and singing job and the music as indicated is quite ambitious, featuring, among others \\"Suite Sister Mary\\", a ten-minute track with orchestrations by Michael Kamen.<br /><br />The band released two hit singles \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\" and \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\" from this album which is basically hard driving heavy metal except for these singles, which are both power ballads. Interspersed within the music are four suites of dialogue and several other cameos of short monologue or dialogue which help tell the story. These certainly add a nice touch in completing this great recording.<br /><br />Da Story<br /><br />Operation Mindcrime begins in a hospital ward where a patient named Nikki after a pain shot from a nurse who calls him a bastard, recalls the recent rash of murders he perpetrated at the request of Dr. X. Nikki, you see, was a psychotic, cynical malcontent who was recruited and brainwashed by the nefarious Dr. X, a power crazed evangelical preacher, leader of 'The Order', to be his personal assassin.<br /><br />After getting Nikki addicted to drugs, brainwashed and dependent on him for his fixes, Dr. X sends Nikki first out to kill an unnamed corrupt politician, then his girlfriend Mary (an ex hooker) and the priest who got her off the streets because they are risks.<br /><br />After completing his mission but not remembering it, he finds Mary murdered and realizing what he has done, Nikki goes on a drug binge and ends up in the hospital, the victim of a self induced narcotics overdose. From there the songs vacillate to a series of recriminations and rationalizations with \\"Breaking the Silence\\" \\"I don't Believe in Love\\" and \\"The Eyes of a Stranger\\".<br /><br />My Favorites<br /><br />It is truly a hard choice on this album but here is my list of the four best songs:<br /><br />\\"Spreading the Disease\\"<br /><br />For those faint of heart you may want to stay away from this song as it's just loaded with sex and deviancy. It is the sordid tale of Mary a prostitute, whom Nikki tries to save by getting a priest to take her off the streets. This emotive song is set to heavy double base drums at a medium/fast tempo with plenty of metal accompaniment.<br /><br />\\"Suite Sister Mary\\"<br /><br />A ten minute and forty second masterpiece, this 'piece de resistance' starts out with Dr. X ordering Nikki to go out and kill Mary and the priest after which, \\"Mary\\" starts out with a solo melodic guitar and a Choir which goes on to accompany Tate throughout the song. As on the whole album there are sound effects and dialogue thrown in such as thunder and sirens.<br /><br />The music itself is again a highly emotional but variable paced number that is a wonderful confluence of rock/metal and opera.<br /><br />\\"I don't Believe in Love\\"<br /><br />In this song Nikki denies hislove for Mary because he cannot face the fact that he murdered her. It is a sad melancholy power ballad. It is very melodic with a varied pace, the verses being slower than the chorus. This was released as a single because it is quite accessible and it was a minor hit even though taken away from the story it loses something.<br /><br />\\"The Eyes of a Stranger\\"<br /><br />This is my favorite song after \\"Mary\\", it is again very melodic varied tempo piece with a great guitar intro. Tate does some powerful singing here on the choruses. the song picks up speed as it goes on up to about a medium pace.<br /><br />Another single and again a minor hit.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />I have a confession to make. I don't put much emphasis on lyrics and seldom pay much attention to them, especially when they are hard to understand. Operation: Mindcrime is the exception. The lyrics are easily understood and tell a sad if not exciting, suspenseful story. I'm sure everyone will have their own interpretation of this monumental work, in my case I visualized definite similarities to the movie Manchurian Candidate.<br /><br />In this day of terrorism and runaway fanatical religion this classic album/story gains even more importance.<br /><br />There are so many nuances in the epic CD that everytime I listen to it I pick up something new.

0448060191|2.0|I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist.
B0006213WG|3.0|Check out the song \\"Bitter end\\"... <br />cant get a better \\"xerox\\" of Battery !!!! <br />we're all to blame is kinda good number... <br />the dast tempo suddenly pauses for a slow riff, typo of System of a Down !! <br />Chuck is definitely good, taking the plagiarisms away !!!
B00005JMJG|4.0|...is not the cleverness of the conceit, nor the ingenuity used in representing the memory erasure, nor the flashing forward and back in time, nor any of the other story-telling devices.  No, the real surprise is how sweet and touching is the love story that emerges through all of the imaginative convolutions. <br /> <br />With, perhaps, Jim Carrey's most sincere and accomplished \\"straight\\" acting job, matched in full by a fine performance by Kate Winslet, we finally get beyond adroit inventiveness in a Charlie Kauffman script, and get down to some real heart: very touching and ringing true. <br /> <br />Well done in all departments, it is the bittersweet longing for love in the eyes and actions of the leads that brings this film home.  4-1/2 stars.  Well worthwhile.
B000006YYM|5.0|Gentle Giant's, \\"The Power and the Glory,\\" epitomizes the blending of English cultural and music history with fusion rock. Musicians who have studied music will especially appreciate the fascinating harmonizing and timing arrangements in their songs. The music on this album was way ahead of it's time - not to mention way ahead of the present pop music scene! The band members are extremely talented and skilled musicians and their free-flowing arrangements give evidence to open-minded, eclectic music scene of the mid-70s. When you listen to this album you can see how musicians then could play what they feel (and turn it into an album) rather than worry about appeasing a narrow-minded \\"teeny-bopper\\" market. Every song is a classic and any curious listener who has not heard this band before, or has not bought one of their albums yet, has to start here. This is the best of the best. American listeners will find no other band that compares.  - Forrest Woolman
B0006A9FMI|2.0|If you thought the first Ghost in the Shell tackled the deep issues of the human condition and what makes us humans, you were wrong.  Though visually stunning, Mamoru substitutes substance with his own rambling beliefs about determinism (greatly influenced by Japanese culture), the essence of the human condition, and identity, ultimately leaving the viewer confused and disappointed.  The most confusing scene involves a recursive journey deep into the mind of the only fully human character as he and his partner question a man whose obsession with machinery has led him to transfer his \\"ghost\\" entirely into the body of a doll to preserve his life indefinitely. <br /> <br />The short and sadly lacking action scenese are bloody, brutal, and satisfying, and the animation style of laying hand drawn characters over computer animated backgrounds works well, but does not make up for the movies failures.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Don't Listen to these naysayers. <br />First of all, if you loved the Matrix trilogy, get this set! <br />The picture and audio quality is much improved, the revisited discs are chock full of awesome and/or hilarious little things. <br />The commentary discs are great. Cornell West and Ken Wilber are pretty funny and very, very educated and bring out some of the great ideas of the films.  <br /> <br />Second of all, don't be put off by these people that say \\"I loved the first movie, but the rest of them blew...\\" The second and third movies are great, they just take a lot of effort to digest and understand. Listening to these philosophical commentaries, and reading some of the sources and ideas that they present will help you. You'll get out of these films what you put in. If you just want to sit and passively be entertained in the classic hollywood formulaic way, then go get the Die Hard Trilogy. The set of critics commentaries tends to show how dumb and clueless they really are. For instance, when Neo is at the Mobil Ave. station, one commentator blurts out \\"Look at that, product placement!\\" Which is absolutely ridiculous since Mobil is an anagram for Limbo, which is what Neo is in (like Christ after the Crucifiction), and which Trinity saves him from by going to Club HEL. Just like the ancient Mesopotamian myth of Inanna descending to the underworld to save her Husband. And on and on, layers of mythological, religious and philosophical meaning. (Sometimes the critics make interesting points, noticing some of the visual statements that the film makes. But their ignorance can be plainly seen in cases such as this.)  <br /> <br />It's also an incredible bargain at only $55 dollars. <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This film appeals to so many people for so many different  reasons, that it's tough to begin a review.For a comedy,  this movie was hillarious! The physical comedy reminded me  a bit of Chris Farley and the Three Stooges. I could watch  this movie a thousand times, and I'd still laugh when  Shaun tries to jump over the fence and it collapses  underneath him. For a romantic movie, it was good enough  to keep my girlfriend glued to her seat, so it get's a  'thumbs up' in that department. And, for a zombie movie,  it's the best one I've seen (and I've seen almost all of  them).<br /><br />The DVD extras were all very good. It was interresting to see how  they did the special effects (only two examples...more  would have been better) and the plot holes were really  cool. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd have to give this a 9.8.  The only way to make this movie better, would be to have a  cameo with George Romero. This movie was simply fantastic.
1400032717|4.0|More than being a book about autism - this is a book about how a child sees the complex world we live in today. <br /> <br />A genuinely touching and heart-rendering book - it makes an excellent, cannot-put-it-down read. Well worth the investment.
B000005ILF|5.0|If at first you don't care for this album, give it a few listenings. At first it seems disjointed but eventually, as in the epiphany moment of \\"I'm so happy I can't stop crying\\" we feel our eyes opening to a larger picture, a universe where all is connected. This whole album comes to seem almost like one long story. The irony of \\"I'm so happy\\" is heartbreaking, and is balanced by true sorrow in other songs, pure joy in others. Irony continues with the odd cowboy tone that pops up now and then, as strange as the off-rhythms Sting casts them in (does he mock himself? Could an Englishman ever truly \\"get\\" the cowboy thing?). Wandering, flirtation, betrayal, recovery are all here, along with a truly funny \\"All Four Seasons.\\" Having bothered to follow up on the hunch that there was more to this album than first meets the ear, I feel I've heard secrets that reveal the man. Of course, it's always a temptation to call the novel the story of the novelist, but this album really has the feel of personal truth, through rock-solid poetry and imaginative music. P.S. Lithium has been widely used in the treatment of manic depression, which may help understand some of the lyrics of the final song, \\"Lithium Sunset\\" -- and the album as a whole.
0452282152|1.0|Johannes Vermeer's most famous painting, Girl with a Pearl Earring, has touched and mystified audiences since it was completed in 1665 in Delft, Holland. It depicts a beautiful, if simple, young woman in three-quarter profile wearing an unusual headdress and a large pearl teardrop earring. The girl's wide eyes and slightly parted lips suggest a startling and <br />innocent sensuality. Unfortunately, Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same title (Plume Printing, 2001) captures none of the elegance nor timelessness of the original Vermeer. <br /> <br />The plot is similar to a school creative writing assignment to concoct a story based on a still-life picture. Chevalier imagines the painting's young subject as 16-year-old Griet - the daughter of a painter whose family is thrown into poverty by his sudden blindness. In desperation, the family sends Griet to work as a housemaid in the home of Johannes Vermeer. Griet there encounters about 170 pages' worth of discomforts - from fearing the family's Catholic faith to finding virtually everyone in the household unpleasant. Vermeer's wife, Catherina, envies her; his mother-in-law, Maria Thins, intimidates her; and his tiresome daughters pester her. Longsuffering Griet tolerates these irritations in silence out of devotion to her master who, for no comprehensible reason, enlists Griet to help him with his art. She buys his supplies, mixes his paints, and begins advising him on ways to improve his work. All the while she is falling into a sort of canine awe of him. Eventually he is moved to paint her wearing his wife's earrings - presumably because he finds Griet more attractive and engaging than the shrew to whom he is married, though we know from the outset this move is destined to end very badly. <br /> <br />Sounds dull? It is. This novel has to be one of the better sleep aids on the over-the-counter market. The real low point comes when Griet spends three pages describing her dusting routine. <br /> <br />What it lacks in plot it lacks further in character. The story is told in first-person by Griet. This was Chevalier's first mistake. We spend 220 pages painfully aware that we are inside the head of someone who doesn't think much. Griet simply isn't fleshed-out enough to go through any changes as a result of her experience and therefore engender any interest or sympathy. <br /> <br />The prose itself is, at best, uninspiring and, at worst, distracting. Chevalier makes no attempt to use language that will give us the feel of 17th century Holland. Her modern turns of phrase give Griet the voice of a simple-minded Midwestern girl from present-day America. The short sentences and limited vocabulary suggest she was striving for an elegant simplicity and wound up with something like the writing of a 7-year-old. <br /> <br />Fond as she is of reminding us that she is illiterate, Griet demonstrates a sudden and sophisticated knowledge of modern art theory, altering Vermeer's subjects while he's not looking and instructing her master in colors, shape, and light. <br /> <br />Chevalier herself holds a Masters degree in creative writing and cited only two references used to research the book - one on Dutch history and one on Vermeer. This may account for some of the novel's shortcomings. It would appear she set off armed with only three bits of knowledge - that 17th century Dutch Protestants didn't like Catholics, that most of them were <br />illiterate, and the painting itself - which she proceeds to belabor at every turn. It's clear by the end that Griet's sexual awakening and Vermeer's unspoken passion are symbolized in the earring itself. But the earring is obviously manipulated to Mean Something that it loses its power to move the reader. <br /> <br />The premise itself is interesting and could have made for a delightful story. While many art historians believe Vermeer's subject was likely one of his daughters, part of the painting's appeal is that no one really knows. Evidence suggests that it was not a commissioned portrait and the painting didn't surface until after Vermeer's death. The lovely girl with her pearl earring and wide-eyed innocence and sensual mouth have kept their secrets almost completely for 340 years. And the literary world would have been better off if Chevalier had left it that way. If you're tempted to pick up Girl with a Pearl Earring, spare yourself and view the painting instead.
630025075X|5.0|When I bought this vhs tape in 1991 at the beginning of my senior year, I heard the best concert performance by DAVID GILMOUR that even outdid the DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER tour, despite that keyboard player Gregg Dechart used a KORG organ instead of the HAMMOND B5 organ.  Furthermore, it also outdoes the PULSE tour that fortunately includes a complete live performance of THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  The highlight of his solo band in my musical opinion was and still is BAD COMPANY'S lead guitarist MICK RALPHS whose guitar playing style gave DAVID's music a whole lot more guitar rock power than TIM WENRICK from the PINK FLOYD tours.  On the other hand, everybody else in this band were also excellent musicians who should always be remembered.  UNTIL WE SLEEP is a outstanding opening song with DAVID and keyboardist GREGG DECHART's 2-part harmony vocals and then the extra harmonies of bass guitarist MICKEY FEAT and MICK RALPHS.  ALL LOVER'S ARE DERANGED is an excellent guitar rock song with MICK and DAVID trading lead guitar riffs.  I also love the way MICK plays rhythm guitar on THERE'S NO WAY OUT OF HERE, as well as the harmonies of MICK, GREGG AND MICKEY.  MICK's guitar playing style on this song and others on this concert has inspired me musically.  After watching this tape, MICK RALPHS has become my most favorite guitar player whose has since that moment inspired me and my guitar playing.  Plus, I have even practiced playing guitar just like him since then.  SHORT AND SWEET is excellent too with ROY HARPER, but RUN LIKE HELL sounds a whole lot better on this concert than the future PINK FLOYD tours.  OUT OF THE BLUE is a great piano ballad, especially seeing DAVID playing the piano himself.  BLUE LIGHT kicks the concert into overdrive, with everybody in a solo spot.  The sound of MICKEY FEAT's bass guitar is excellent and so is Raff Ravenscrof sax playing tone and keyboard playing stills.  Then DAVID introduces his band members, and when he mentions, \\"MICK RALPHS onthe guitar,\\" I was totally surprised.  I knew the guitarist had a more powerful sound on this tour than on the future PINK FLOYD tour, but I would have never guessed that MICK would be in this band instead of TIM.  Plus, I thought that a lot of the musicians from the 1987 PINK FLOYD tour were also from DAVID's 1984 solo band, and I also did not remember the drummer CHRIS SLADE, who I first remember seeing in THE FIRM with JIMMI PAGE and PAUL RODGERS, being bald-headed.  I knew I was definitely glad I found this tape, otherwise I would be missing out on a whole lot of great guitar rock music.  Back to the concert, the closing song MURDER is an excellent surprise.  First of all, David plays the acoustic guitar and Mick plays the electric guitar, which certainly surprised me after seeing David playing the electric guitar while Tim Wenrick plays the acoustic guitar on ON THE TURNING AWAY.  Anyway, when Mick starts playing the lead guitar solo, I was deeply amazed how great the tone of his guitar sounds.  The song in general still makes me think of BAD COMPANY's \\"FEEL LIKE MAKIN' LOVE,\\" eventhough the tone of Mick's guitar solo sounds like the tone of the guitar solo of IF YOU NEEDED SOMEBODY from HOLY WATER.  More importantly, it was an outstanding listening and visual esperience.  Then David switches to his black strat playing lead guitar throughout the song, and then MICK and DAVID close the song with their 2 part harmony lead guitar.  As for the encore of COMFORTABLY NUMB with PINK FLOYD's NICK MASON on drums, this song also outdoes the PINK FLOYD version with the psychodelic keyboard sound of GREGG DECKART, the beginning harmonies of MICKY and GREGG, then DAVID and MICKEY, and later MICK.  I also love the way DAVID works his way up to the signiture high-pitch guitar solo of the song that he usually does not do during the PINK FLOYD tours.  It's a plain same MONEY, ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL, and other PINK FLOYD did not make it on this tape.  The 2 videos are greatand so it the half hour special of his solo tour that features interviews from THE WHO's PETE TOWNSHEND and PINK FLOYD's NICK MASON.  I remember when all of this was broadcasted on MTV in 1984.  Why this concert is not on DVD, I certainly can not, nor will, understand the reason for that.  This should not be judged due to the lack of the PINK FLOYD name.  In my musical opinion, DAVID GILMOUR had the best sounding solo career, since his singing and guitar playing did and still does represent the sound of PINK FLOYD.  Maybe his solo tour would have been more successful if he had planned to play MONEY & ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL throughout the whole tour and give notice somehow what PINK FLOYD songs he would perform throughtout this tour.  More importantly, his solo career should not be forgotten.
B00003CXAA|2.0|To Start the Movies are awesome for sure. But I had the Collection on tape already, and the quality is no diferent, they just threw the same picture on the DVDS with the one bonus disk with the extra footage, which is the only reason I gave it a 2. So basically I paid 80 dollars for the extra bonus footage. Almost all the other commentaries were on the tapes as well. The first DVD is all pixilated on an HD TV, and the sound quality is terrible as well. Pretty much the same for them all though. I am very disappointed in Paramount for this rerelease to DVD. They need to take a look at how Lucas remastered the StarWars, Which in My opinion is no where near as good as a movie as the Godfathers. Maybe in another 10 years, or when they want to make more money off of the trilogy, they will digitally remaster, and sell a special edition godfather trilogy set and make another 80 dollars off of everyone. Sad part is, I will buy it too.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is so much better than the remake of Dawn of the Dead. I like that it had a lighter tone than most American horror filmes yet still contained all the gore that we've come to expect. In some scenes, I laughed out loud but for the most part it was just very enjoyable.
6301744136|4.0|I remembered watching this movie as a child, so when I noticed it at our video store and it was PG I checked it out.  My 7 year old son enjoyed it very much - watched it two days in a row.  My only qualifer is that for a PG movie, it had more bad language than I would like - and certainly more than I like my son to hear. <br /> <br />
B00006ZCFH|5.0|She is a classic neo-soul, afrocentric, futurist,  deeva.  I mean who else could have written Back In Da Day with so much clarity and inconspiciousness at the same time.  Only Badu.  The production is so original, definately out of the box.  And then to do a classic remix of \\"da bells\\" with Mamadia, Angie Stone, MC LYTE and Latifah. I mean......... She is in a class by herself but still in the realm of her audience's taste and  expectations.   <br /> <br />We love her.
B000000OUJ|5.0|I've had this album for many years and it still gets as much play now as ever.  Incredible and is definitely one of the most amazing hip hop albums ever
B00065JTBA|1.0|OK, just starting with the \\"package\\" in which this CD is encased: ain't that sort of a...gratuitous...FLAGRANT Elvis ripoff?  Jon Bon Jovi is/was, really, at best, the David Cassidy of the eighties.  I mean, doesn't that fact tell you anything?  That the \\"title\\" to this \\"thing\\" ain't really the (mm-a'huh-huh-huh) truth?
B0006399FS|1.0|Its not that its inappropriate, its that it sucks.  Vertigo is not that good, and the rest of the songs on the cd are crap.  Buy their older cds if you want their good songs, but if you just want to be \\"cool\\" buy this cd, but be warned, after about three weeks, it gets annoying.  Mine did.  I almost bought a u2ipod, but thank goodness i didnt.  What a waste that would have been.
6305841861|4.0|Evil Dead II is a superb movie.  Sure the acting ain't so good but these people showed some great effort.  The Plot was great too and even though the film is classified as Horror it wasn't that scary but with a bit of a comedic touch on it.  The atmospher in the film was pretty spooky and Ash kicked demonic [...] like usual.  This DVD is pretty good too, I enjoyed all the Commentary and extras they were great.    The plot is pretty simple but good.  Ash returns to the same Cabin in the woods and unleashes the forces of evil.  Ash is forced to single handedly battle creepy yet crazy Demons and I think you can figure out the rest..  Ash..well what can I say.  The man go's through alot of hell in this film.  He has to kill his demonic girlfriend, his hand is possessed, he has no choice but to saw off his own hand...You just feel for the poor guy.  But near the end he does get a little payback and all I can say is...groovy..    It is one of the coolest horror films around.  The actors are great, I really liked the plot, the monsters were great, the gore(not too gory nor too violent but still great)was great and overall I really enjoyed this film.  I give it a     4.9 out of 5 stars.    By the way this isn't a remake of Evil Dead 1 I donno' why people are saying that...    Lates
B000003TA4|4.0|If Kurt Cobain was around today, I think he would of agreed with the hype (at the time)that came from Nevermind, but today he would'nt agree with the overatedness of the band today. <br /> <br />Kurt Cobain was a nice bloke and its a shame he shot himself.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Yes! This is a great movie. Both guys and girls will enjoy it. It is one of the best (if not the best) romantic comedy I have seen. Jennifer Lopez's portrayal is out of this world (her best to date). You will fall in love with Richard Gere and Susan Suranden. Buy it, buy it, buy it!
B0002OERI0|2.0|Billi Joe Armstrong said that this album is the best \\"PUNK ROCK\\" <br />album in 10 years. Well just because Green Day is considered a punk rock band, does'nt mean this album sounds like it. <br /> <br />The real Green Day sound came from the albums \\"Warning\\" \\"Dookie\\" and their most in your face powerful punch - \\"insomniac\\" (I think Nimrod was'nt that good) but this is just mainstream junk. <br /> <br />The band sound so polished and fake on this record and very mainstream, which is not what Green Day should be. <br />Green Day have hit an all time low with this, and while mainstream audiences will all love it. <br /> <br />People who like real sounding music and a real band will see through it, and they have. <br /> <br />They are being supported on tour by \\"Simple Plan\\" for goodness sake!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!  If you voted for Bush watch it and just see how IGNORANT you were for voting for him.  If Gore would of won the 2000 election we would not even be in this mess (War in Iraq).  George Bush has made more mistakes than we can count!!  Which is why it baffles me that the American people would even consider electing him again let alone actually doing it.  November 2 2004 was a huge mistake!!  Kerry should be the one in the White House.   <br /> <br />Someone told me this and it is right on, \\"Voting for George Bush was more of an investment in Jesus Christ than in George Bush.\\"  I have never heard anything more truer than that.  Just shows that all you have to do is say that you are a Christian to get elected.  I've heard people say that this was the first time they felt Jesus Christ was in the White House.  Everytime I hear that I laugh.  I laugh hard.  I'm sure that many former Presidents were Christians, but see they didn't have to use that excuse to get elected! <br />Thank You Michael Moore for making this movie. <br /> <br />p.s. What did those harmless civilians from Iraq ever do to us that made George Bush bomb them and start a war??  I really wish there was an answer....
0385336810|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and like other reviewers have stated, read it in about 4 hours.  My only comment is what's with Panther cola-stupid name.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|It reminds me a lot of Adam and the Ants- Dirk Wears White Sox album. Very enjoyable to listen to.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|At the end of the first movie, Neo became The One.  Now he is legendary amongst the free humans and the city of Zion. <br /> <br />But what is The One really?  Who is the Oracle and why is she allowed to exist?  That is the main thrust of this chapter of the Matrix saga. <br /> <br />But no quest is simple.  Agent Smith has brand new abilities thanks to his defeat by Neo in the first movie.  No longer is he a simple enforcement program.  Now he is more like a virus, able to overwrite his code onto others. <br /> <br />So we have Neo's quest to find out what he is, the new threat from Smith, and of course the machines are stepping up their efforts to wipe out the free humans.  Quite a lot for a movie that some feel is just a bunch of special effects. <br /> <br />But this movie is not just special effects.  The answered questions go a long way to making this chapter make far more sense than the first.  The setting is some time after the first movie and it would be nice to know a little more about what went on during that time but the revelation of Zion helps to make up for it. <br /> <br />All in all this is a very good sequel although the true movie was too long and it was split into two pieces.  This means that this chapter ends a little abruptly and you might want to have the next chapter available before you watch this one.
B0001HLVS2|1.0|You can't make up for poor directing and boring dialogue with special effects.This movie was a complete failure. I would give it no stars if that was possible. Having read all of the Lucky Jack novels I was hoping that Russell Crowe would be able to bring to the screen something of what Patrick O'Brian had created in his 20 novel series. After the first hour I had to begin fast forwarding. It was a complete and total waste of my time. Even if I had not read the novels, this movie was just poorly done. I didn't care about the characters, the fighting scenes had good special effects but since I don't watch a movie for the special effects this did nothing to add to a movie that simply didn't make it as far as directing or acting was concerned. Save your money and time, give this movie a miss. Or better yet, get a copy of Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando.
6305428220|4.0|A star studded cast stars in this sci-fi/horror send off.  Paying tribute to classic science fiction this film does an excellent job of starting fast and picking up speed. <br /> <br />A small town school that rests on the merits of its football team becomes the target of an alien invasion.  Symbiotic aliens (mistakenly called parasites) take control of members of the school faculty.  From there they move on to assimilating the student body and the local authorities.  Soon it seems as if the whole town has been taken over except a small group of students. <br /> <br />While trying to maintain their own identity, the students realize that if they do not act offensively the invasion will quickly spread across the state and then the world. Their only hope lies in stopping the invasion now. <br /> <br />The story, while not completely original, comes right out and says it is a tribute to Heinlein's The Puppet Masters.  But this is not just a remake.  An extra dimension is added.  It could be possible that the public is the target of a huge conspiracy aimed at making them more accepting of the idea of aliens and extraterrestrial life.  This film also maintains a level of action and suspense without turning sappy at some point as so many do. <br /> <br />Definitely a fun movie with a lot going for it and very little against it.  Check it out.
B00003CXCT|5.0|why are people giving this low ratings and saying bad things? it says on the vhs box set that its the last time the ORIGINAL TRILOGY will be put out right there. maybe people should read things.
B000065V41|5.0|This is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen. It's great because the comedy can be appreciated by both children and adults. I can't emphasize enough how good the narration is, it's done by Rizzo the rat and Gonzo who plays Charles Dickens. Despite being acted by puppets it very closely follows the original Christmas Carol. Michael Caine is amazing in this movie, Oscar worthy performance (come on it's hard to act against puppets!). The music is just beautiful. The singing and musical elements in the movie make it the best musical version of a Christmas Carol. All of this comes together to create one of the most memorable Christmas movies of all time.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna was just voted the worst actress in history(that being a pop-singer turned actress, or attempting to be one), by readers and critics in Blender Magazine this month. Mariah Carey came in a distant second. As far as this album is concerned, the same could be said as well. Without a busload of bigtime producers and writers this time, Madonna is on her own w/American Life, and it shows. Her voice is so painfully thin that the mediocre material suffers even more. And the shameful overdubbing proves that she is not a real singer, but someone who is desperately trying to cover up all the inconsistencies in her weak 1 octave vocal range. When you factor in all the electronica(that hasn't been popular in 3 years), you have an embarrassing CD, that would be difficult to get 50 cents for at a yard sale.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I fell in love with Let Go and was waiting on tenderhooks for Avril's second album. When it finally came out I snapped it up straight away and look at the result!<br /><br />1. 'Take Me Away'- wow. Just wow. I was stunned as soon as I heard it and it immediately became a personal favourite. It was totally different from anything I'd expected. 5/5<br /><br />2. 'Together'- I was surprised to hear the piano in there, but it added a great touch to Avril's beautiful voice. Not a favourite though. 4/5<br /><br />3. 'Don't Tell Me'- it was good when it came on the radio but you get a bit tired of it after a while. 3/5<br /><br />4. 'He Wasn't'- this is pretty high energy, great for when you're about to go out. It really gets you in the mood. 4/5<br /><br />5. 'How Does It Feel'- I love this song. When she goes up high, it has a beautiful sound. 5/5<br /><br />6. 'My Happy Ending'- this was an awesome second single, with a brilliant video to match. The lyrics and sound are really good. 5/5<br /><br />7. 'Nobody's Home'- this is my favourite song on the album for sure. It's really beautiful and the lyrics are brilliant. She really goes for it on this one. 10/5!<br /><br />8. 'Forgotten'- this is very like Unwanted on the first album, except ten times better! Another favourite of mine, it's really hard-edged. 5/5<br /><br />9. 'Who Knows'- it has a good sound but it isn't anything special. 3/5<br /><br />10. 'Fall To Pieces'- another brilliant track! It's got a really nice sentimental sound to it without getting wimpy. 5/5<br /><br />11. 'Freak Out'- I'm sorry but this song just doesn't do it for me. It is pretty irritating after you've listened to it a couple of times, and the lyrics are kinda pre-school. 1/5<br /><br />12- 'Slipped Away'- this is a beautiful song dedicated to her grandfather. It's really sad. 5/5<br /><br />13- 'I Always Get What I Want'- this is a high-energy bonus track and is really really good! 5/5<br /><br />Buy this cd, it's definitely worth it!
B0006399FS|3.0|I heard Vertigo and I thought \\"great U2 is getting heavy again\\". Then I got the cd! If you are expecting the rest of the record to sound like Vertigo you are going to seriously be disappointed. Straight after Vertigo the record heads into pretty tepid waters. Not to say it is necessarily bad, \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" are great songs, but after track three the record goes downhill. The remainder of the record is either mediocre (i.e. \\"Crumbs from your table\\") or just downright atrocious like \\"Original of the Species\\". Yeah this record is once again going to sell millions and give them a billion grammy's but the question is should you buy it. I don't think so. There is no point in paying $15 for a cd with three great songs and bunch of filler.
B000089RVX|4.0|I first heard 'Bring Me To Life' on the radio, and I fell in love instantly. I'd never heard anything like it; it had amazing guitars and a haunting vocalist. I immediately got my friend to send me it and listened to it on repeat for ages before I finally managed to get the album. And was the rest of the cd as impressive as that song? Hell yeah!<br /><br />1. 'Going Under'- a personal favourite, I was obsessed with it as soon as it started. The chorus is really catchy and the sound is really amazing. Amy Lee really pours her heart out when she sings and Ben Moody does a really good short solo.<br /><br />2. 'Bring Me To Life'- again an amazing song, the one that started it. It has a really good unique sound and is pretty powerful to listen to.<br /><br />3. 'Everybody's Fool'- this has a good steady beat and is also really catchy, love this track.<br /><br />4. 'My Immortal'- I didn't really like this song when I first heard it on the cd, because it was quite a bit slower than the others, more of a ballad. But I continued to listen to it and it really grew on me. Amy's voice is beautiful in this track.<br /><br />5. 'Haunted'- very graveyard-esque. It is suitably spooky. Not one of my favourites but still good.<br /><br />6. 'Tourniquet'- really good song. I loves it as soon as I heard it.<br /><br />7. 'Imaginary'- the lyrics are very different, but it has a really nice sound to it. Not one of my favourites.<br /><br />8. 'Taking Over Me'- this is definitely my favourite song on the entire album. It's got a really really amazing sound and Amy Lee sounds the best in my opinion on this track. It gives me the shivers it's so good.<br /><br />9. 'Hello'- another slow one. Not one of my favourites, it's quite short.<br /><br />10. 'My Last Breath'- I really love this track too. The lyrics are great and it is totally catchy.<br /><br />11. 'Whisper'- not another of my favourites as I'm not too keen on the male chanting thing at the end, but it is really really powerful and worth a listen.<br /><br />In general, this album is a brilliant debut, so go and buy it like I did!is a brilliant debut, so go and buy it like I did!
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn solidified her position in hip-hop with the release of this cd.  I saw a review where someone gave her 4 stars and i just thought that was tragic!  From the intro to the final song you feel every bit of her beautiful voice and her emotions.  I never as a man felt so touched by a woman's voice.  She is the best female MC on this planet.
0140049975|5.0|I hadn't read John Steinbeck since high school but returned to him about a year ago when our book group read his novel, \\"The Winter of our Discontent.\\"  Following that, I read several other Steinbeck novels and recently had the good luck to read \\"East of Eden\\".  It is admirable that Oprah Winfrey used this large, complex novel to present to her audience.<br /><br />Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden\\" in a burst of energy over several months in 1951.  He loved this book among all his works and, literally, put himself into it.  The first-person narrator of the story is, indeed, Steinbeck himself speaking in his own voice as a a grandson of Samuel Hamilton, born in Ireland and a hero of this novel.<br /><br />Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all-- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\"  (Quotation is from the chronology in the Library of America edition of Steinbeck's novels, 1942-1952 at 963.)  For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals.  I was transfixed by the book, couldn't put it down, and read it in a short time.<br /><br />The story includes the \\"doubles\\" to which Steinbeck refers as well as some others.  The book is the story of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks.  It is the story of two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and of the two twin sons of Adam Trask and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb.  Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.  Steinbeck gives this story a full, biblical style exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.<br /><br />The Trask family and the Hamilton family are settlers in the Salinas Valley in California.  \\"East of Eden\\" develops a fine sense of place and when I finished the book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself.  Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's grandfather, figures prominently in this book for his wisdom, his stoicism, his inventiveness, and his other-wordliness.  His wife, Lisa, is also portrayed with a great deal of love.<br /><br />Perhaps the most memorable character of the book is Cathy Trask who becomes \\"Kate\\" after she leaves Adam Trask and returns to the profession of prostitution in which she was engaged before her marriage. Steinbeck calls her a \\"monster\\" and well he might.  The portrayal is striking and even nuanced at the end for all the starkness.<br /><br />Lee, a Chinese servant, is also well portrayed for his subtelty, wisdoms love of learing, and ultimately, devotion to the Trasks and understanding of himself.<br /><br />This is a sweeping, dramatically told story which captures the land, the good and evil of which people are capable, and the importance of what in the Cain and Abel story is described by the Hebrew word \\"Timshel\\" with which Steinbeck concludes his novel.  People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil.  The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.<br /><br />\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that deserves the attention it has recently received.in California.  \\"East of Eden\\" develops a fine sense of place and when I finished the book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself.

People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil.  The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.<br /><br />\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that deserves the attention it has recently received.
B000000OQF|1.0|yes i am a hardcore limp bizkit fan. i truly believe this is the reason for the downfall in music today. it was this band who made mtv big, they featured on it thus giving it more airplay. i am a big fan of the bands mtv have but not this is is utter crap. good charlotte, simple plan, sum41, vannilla ice, hilary duff are all talented artists and could be sometimes overlooked because of their unheard of talent. so what im trying to say here is go listen to breakstuff by limpbizkit and youll know what im saying <br /> <br />AIM: yoohooscoobydoo
B00005JMX6|3.0|This film, I have to admit, hit me on a very emotional level.  My senior year in high school was this movie, only turned down about 50 notches.  No, there were no porn stars or pimps.  But there was a girl I was crazy about who broke me out of my shell and taught me to live for another human is very liberating.  Perhaps too liberating as my relationship with her led to months of delinquency that finally crossed the line and brought an end to the trouble making.  I even had a virginal sex advisor.  Because of this I was sucked directly into this film and felt for the characters.  That said this is a good, but flawed film.  It has a tight script that works as a screwball comedy for horny teenage boys.  It is filed with hilarious scenes.  I especially liked the scene where Matthew had to give a speech while high on ecstasy.  The film also refuses to bend over for convention.  Yes, in the end it is a soft film.  However, it is not nearly as soft as its inspiration Risky Business.  Where that film tried to prevent us from stepping out of line by showing the consequences, this film tells out that the consequences are all a scam.  Sometimes you have to reject \\"The Man\\" to win the girl.  It is refreshing to hear that from a Hollywood movie.  It also had fun playing with the concept of what happens when tonnages run into their fantasies.  Porn stars seem to lose their appeal when their business associate robs you of $25,000 and sicks the cops on you.  There were a lot of problems that did prevent it from being great.  I didn't like its cloudy morality.  They spend tons of time spitting on the porn industry while exploiting its mystique to sell movie tickets.  Also, the scaremongering of the sex ed tapes are played for laughs but in the end I found myself asking myself if this was a sex ed video.  The answer is probably no, but it does do its fair share of scaremongering along the way. 3.25 out of 5
0812550706|2.0|As I read review after review describing Ender's Game as one of the best books of all time or a work of complete genius, I was compelled to make a comment to balance out the gross hype this book gets everywhere you hear of it.  I first read this novel as an eighth grader, and just re-read it as a freshman in college.          I have to say that this may be one of the most overhyped books of all time. While this book is clearly a page-turner, it is just that, and nothing more. It is a purely plot-driven story, and will fail to capture the mind of anybody who actually enjoys reading real literature due to its poor character development, plain prose, lack of intellectual depth, and an extremely unrealistically justified plot twist at the end of the book.  Before bashing this book, I want to say that if you're a young student or somebody who looks to reading for nothing more than an entertaining story, you will most likely find this satisfying. The story is creative, the premise very interesting, the story moves very quickly, and even if it lacks depth, it keeps you guessing at what will happen next.     In the case that you are looking for quality literature, you will be disappointed. Aside from the protagonist, none of the characters are meaningfully fleshed out. Characters generally fit the binary template of \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", and they hardly evolve or change in their personality over the course of the story. And even though Card gives us continual insight into the protagonist's mind, I found it hard to empathize with him for two reasons: First, his thought processes are overly simplistic, alternating between mindsets such as total apathy and complete determination, or extreme anger and debilitating sadness.  My second criticism of Ender is that he is basically perfect. The author fails to show where he lacks in any part of his character. He is more intelligent than anybody he comes across, extremely athletic, and has no trouble dealing with any circumstance, intellectually or physically. At first I was not irritated by his supreme intelligence, but as you move through the story, you realize, Card endows him with the emotional and psychological understanding of a socially gifted adult. So not only is he intellectually perfect, but emotionally as well. Ender faces little to no trouble in overcoming obstacles over the course of the story, basically plowing through everything thrown at him. His extreme resilience is something that no normal human being can actually empathize with, and after a while, I gave up on trying to relate to him.  Just because the author gives us consistent access to the protagonist's train of thought does NOT denote that the character development in this story is of high quality. Perhaps Card intended to make Ender perfect, and knew that his effort to do so would inherently create a division between him and the reader, but he does nothing to compensate for this, such as seriously developing other characters.       As I mentioned before, this book lacks serious depth.  The prose is devoted purely to furthering the plot, and in no way enhances the story. The scientific and philosophical ideas that are occasionally brushed upon are discussed too superficially to add anything to the book or stand on their own to be talked about outside of the context of the plot.         The last complaint I have is that while on the surface the action in this book is very interesting, we are given such little insight into it and such vague descriptions of the way that it transpires, that it is extremely difficult to appreciate the \\"genius\\" that Ender creates in the games. Descriptions of action generally were bland and lifeless, rather than making me feel as if I was actually there.      Ender's Game is a fun, quick read, but it is written at a high-school quality level and lacks the depth, whether philosophically or in terms of its characters, to serve as much more than a good book to read on a long plane ride.
0684852756|1.0|I found this book to be appalingly shallow and, taken as a whole, rather dull.  There is no thought-provoking content introduced here; just the sad, silly ramblings of a typical self-absorbed post-modernist urban male trying to recapture the youthful zeal of a past rememberd but never lived. Not only did I fail to sympathize with the narrator, I did not care what he was saying or why.<br /><br />I did not have a problem with the novel's content - infidelity has been the topic of novels, films and plays too numerous to mention, many of which I've enjoyed.  The successful ones broach the subject with a clear eye or fresh voice (or both), and shed light on what is generally overlooked or ignored.  INTIMACY does none of those things.
0064407667|1.0|This book creeped me out, and not the good kind of creeped out.  It was disturbing.  The book was nothing but kids being abused in horrible ways. There were more than blatant sexual overtones to the story, and it's being marketed to the 9-12 age group. Count Olef, the children's creepy old adopted father, tries to force the 14 year old girl, Violet, to marry him, and threatens to kill her baby sister if she doesn't. There is a reference made to the \\"wedding night.\\" The whole thing was just sick.  I'm 17, and I don't know if i'm gonna be able to get to sleep tonight, after reading this story.  Please don't give this book to a young child.
1400032717|5.0|THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME proved clever, engaging, and original from beginning to end.  A brilliant, thought-provoking read that manages to be both fresh and wise, quirky and honest.<br /><br />The author invites us into a world painstakingly drawn, from the societal nuances most of us take for granted to the complex yet logical thought processes of a wildly intelligent yet socially inept autistic child.  This book challenges the way its readers view common conceptualizations of God, love, and the universe without being heavy-handed or moralistic.  THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is, in fact, virtually free from what is commonly thought of as moral preaching at all.<br /><br />If you want to challenge yourself while being entertained, you cannot do better than Haddon's book.  A brilliant debut, and a fresh, completely honest voice.
6305922756|5.0|A documentary made by a filmmaker named Marti DiBergi ( played by Rob Reiner) gives a look into England's loudest heavy metal band called \\"Spinal Tap\\" on their history from 60's swingers to a rock sensation that has swept both America & England, there is interviews with the band members Nigel Tugnel ( Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins ( Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls ( Harry Shearer) and behind the scenes of their latest album \\"Smell the Glove\\".<br /><br />This entertaining and hilarious mockumentary on a fictional non-existent rock band has became a cult sensation and a midnight favorite. There is such originality within the script itself, a self-mocking sense of humor is what helps the comedy of this movie.<br /><br />Rob Reiner's direction is flawless, there is also appearences by Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal makes this one unforgettable cult comedy experience you must not miss.<br /><br />The special edition is just as great as the movie itself with awesome transfer & great sound quality, the extras are also very good such as audio commentary by Spinal Tap themselves, outtakes, music videos, 6 TV commericals, Trailers, a Fictional but funny Flower People Press Conference, Spinal Tap appearence on \\" The Joe Franklin Show\\" and \\" Heavy Metal Memories\\" fake commercial.<br /><br />This is totally one of the best comedies ever made, so if you love a good laugh & rock music at the same time, i suggest you own this movie and enjoy.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Buying DVDs for some (like me) can be a quite a decision. DO i like the movie that much to buy it? DO i think i would enjoy this DVD when i see this 2,3,4... 10 times!. <br />This movie meets these criterias very well. <br />-&#62; Great story <br />-&#62; Great acting-even from the support cast <br />-&#62; Inspires you (good for repeat viewing) <br />-&#62; Strong emotions but not over the top. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this DVD. If i were to own just 5 DVDs i would choose this to be one of them!
B000268QB2|3.0|woah, when I first heard of Keane I thought it was impossible. But I checked them out and I bought their CD and they were playing with velvet revolver. Well they are pretty good, they're not horrible. but, it gets pretty boring after awhile. And I hand't picked up and listened to their CD in forever, and the only time I listen to their CDs is when I'm trying to sleep and want to fall asleep really fast but all the other times I keep it safe in its case. Because no matter how good they are they're still not as good as any other band with guitars but I support the whole idea of being different.
1591840562|3.0|I thought that Kawasaki's book gives a good starting point for those completely new to the concept of starting a business or any endeavor. Certainly his comments are most relevant to businesses and less so to those interested in starting a change in their current place of employment or life. Some of Guy's comments are pretty basic and obvious, but he explains them in a way that's personable, practical and less jargony than many of his peers. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a place to start and don't mind a text that won't give you direct tools or a blueprint this is a good book to purchase. For those looking for additional help some of Guy's other books might assist and for those interested in more general change/initiatives look at ChangeThis.com for some innovative ideas. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You know, in the long, sad history of this little rock we call Earth, there have been many ghastly mistakes, crimes and travesties. If you could write all of these mistakes down in a big book, the cancellation and mismanagement of 'Firefly' by the Fox network would be just a few pages back from Vietnam and the conception of the beer-can-holding hat (Possibly just a few pages before day Lionel Ritchie decided to breed...possibly.) <br /> <br />Well, as I'm sure you can tell by now, I like the show. Joss Whedon's work on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Alien: Resurrection, Angel, and the like were, to put it delicately, very bad, in this reviewer's opinion. However, he did well on this one. Perhaps he just got lucky, but the one thing can tell you is that he knocked this one out of the park and into the heads of us, the innocent but grateful bystander's. <br /> <br />Now that I've had my say about the writing, I'd like to comment on the technical stuff. The effects are what would be expected, stunning but not unusually so. I can't count how many times some one has told me the effects in a movie of show were great, though. Not that they're not right, it's just that effects have to be great for it to get aired. Next time you see a modern, nationally broadcast television show that runs for more than ten episodes that has really bad effects, tell me and I'll eat my hat. Actually, I don't have a hat...tell you what, I'll buy at hat, and than eat it, while watching ten consecutive hours of `Lost In Space.'  <br /> <br />But, I digress. The thing to look for in these episodes is not the effects, flashy guns, and what have you, but the characters. Each of the nine key characters has a distinct, and endlessly entertaining personality and back-story. You grow to really love them, and, even the 'Companion' character, Inara, whom I hated like at the beginning, grew on me. Each of the main characters have their own little moments where you can really understand what they're after, whatthey're about. So, buy this DVD set and I swear you'll never regret it. Even if you do regret it, I'm sure the 'Amazon.com' people will be more than happy to supply you with a detailed profile on me, so you may hunt me down. That is my promise to you. <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|While many people call \\"Spirited Away\\" Miyazaki's master work, I would have to say that \\"Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind\\" is his best film to date.  While all of his films are wonderful this is my favorite.  Miyazaki is the man that inspires the people at Pixar.  Finally, an American version of Nausicaa that isn't edited for the American short attention span.  This magical film works on all levels, a wonderful children's story that has some serious issues and can be explored very deeply.  Not to mention being beautifully animated and like all Miyazaki works; extremely imaginative and inspirational.  A must have for any Miyazaki fan.  FYI, a unedited English version of Nauiscaa is a huge deal because the first time Miyazaki released the film in the US it was butchered in the editing room.  He was so upset by this that he has forever had a bad taste about America as a audience.  Now we can finally enjoy the work the way it was meant to be viewed.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Will Smith sure has bulked up and it proves worthwhile in this futuristic thriller about robotic help.  Science fiction fans will not be impressed with the average repetitive special effects, but it does prove to be a good thrill ride.  Del Spooner (Will Smith) is distrustful of robots and you find out why later, although according to the three `rules', no robot can ever hurt a human being.  The plot is simple, but has enough action and plot twists to keep you entertained.  The car race scenes are exciting (only in that Del Spooner takes on an army of robots), if not somewhat unbelievable.  The special effects are reminiscent of \\"Tron\\", which proves that Hollywood could have done a lot better.  In any event, the ending wraps things up nicely and proves that it might not be the end of the world and there are good robots and bad robots - just like people.  Enjoy the ride.<br /><br />There are the average number of extras - nothing exciting, however, the DTS 5.1 Surround Sound is the best part.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite DVDs. Kevin Smith has packed this 3-disc 10th Anniversary Edition with so many extras that I have still yet to watch them all. The commentaries alone (one that was done soon after the movie came out and the additional one with the performers revisiting the film 10 years later) are worth the purchase price of this set, as they are hilarious as well as very informative. There is another very lengthy,thorough and in-depth documentary about the making of the film and how they got Mirimax to purchase the rights to the movie that I found to be extremely interesting. This is a must for any fan of Kevin Smith and/or \\"Clerks\\". Highly recommended!

B00025ETIW|5.0|The winning formula of My Chemical Romance (MCR) is a mixture of four totally different styles, Gothic/British vocal and lyric, \\"Sonic youth\\"-ish type of rhythm guitar, neck-breaking \\"Metal\\"-ish guitar solo, and punk/emo rhythm, and this album (their second album and first major label release) show what is the best answer they can work out from the formula. <br /> <br />This 13 tracks disc is a combination of strong melodies, smart and exciting arrangement, breath-taking guitar solo, the mix-up of emo/punk rhythm and guitar solo is refeshing and sucessful twist, they sucessfully made turn and twist and stop, nothing really innovative here, but they just combined things that we already knew in smart and effective ways, in order to push and pull listeners to different climax and scenes, and the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" inspired lyrics are sentimental and powerful, listen to \\"Thank You for the Venom\\", \\"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\\", \\"Helena\\" and their first single \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\", you might feel weird at first, but you'll find yourselves singing their tunes while you have nothing to do soon.
B00004SA8A|5.0|We already have some very good reviews here.    Suffice to say that Schubert other than his famous songs/lieders,  has been described as \\"Beethoven in Heaven.\\" Just let me just add a few words for those who are new to Kempff. Kempff is one of the greatest Beethoven interpreters of all times, well known for his warm and singing tone and at the same time, his ability to shape both large and small forms. In the 60s, he had already possessed a perfect balance between intellect and emotion. According to Kempff, these sonatas recorded in his later years speak with a polyphonic web of voices from far-off worlds...    Nevertheless, to some modern ears, particularly to those who are accustomed either to Gulda or Richter's playing, it is likely that they will find more poetry than drama in Kempff's Schubert sonatas and rightly so, for these are essentially lyrical epics anyway. Here the audience will discover and feel for themselves the potency of the unison between \\"naturalness, spontaneity and exactitude\\" plus the other-worldness of Kempff's playing. I used to refer to Schnabel quite often but not so much now. Likewise, Brendel's Schubert (unlike his Mozart) is superb, and at times I refer to Arrau (e.g. #899 and 935 which are most consoling), but I return to Kempff more often.     I don't actually believe in benchmark performances. But it's a pity that Richter with his facilities and with a repertoire as big as his, had not spent enough time on all the sonatas. It's even more a pity that Gulda recorded comparatively little Schubert. Well, Richter and Gulda could have recorded all by sight-reading them, one could legitimately imagine. But that would be pure speculation. A lot need to be done before committing them into records (at the very least, a thorough understanding of Schubert's musical language as a whole plus the idea behind each piece and its turns and twists) and once a clear overall picture emerges, most likely your vision and treatment won't be the same anymore. To be able to play a few pieces or a certain period well is different from doing the whole cycle well. How are you going to fit in one piece with the others and how is it different from the rest? After all,  very often the meaning of certain unclear or difficult points would only come into light upon reading some other pieces of the same composer. Here, we have Kempff making a wonder of the whole cycle! So, there we are.    While Kempff had in his entire life \\"sought to bring joy and love to people through ... music\\".  So, may I add that other than his Beethoven cycle (particularly the one in 50s, albeit the one that I go to most is Backhaus) and his Schumann, listening to his Schubert is a JOY that would last you a life time. A thing of beauty is a joy forever indeed!
B00005QW5X|2.0|Had I been able to cut out the acted scenes and listen, sans picture, to just the music, I'd have rather enjoyed this strange little picture.  Alas, since I am not locked in eternal angst over my sexuality, nor am I fond of indulgent, homoerotic navel-gazing, I couldn't get into \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\".  Obviously, there is a niche audience for this sort of material, and no doubt that niche adored Hedwig.  For the rest of us who politely sat through this flick on behalf of wives/girlfriends... Well, what can I say?
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I loved this movie, it was fun,entertaining and had a great ending. A must see for all ages.Will is great in this.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Using Scotland's beautiful mountainscape as a background for this movie truly enhances its believability. <br /> <br />J. K. Rowlings works hand in hand with the director to make the movie even more exceptional than the book. The mythical characters are so lifelike and exceptionally done, it is hard to believe they don't really exist!  <br /> <br />Again, the heros use magical means to save the day and a twist ending reveals how they are able to do so.  <br /> <br />The movie, once again, allows us to believe in magick, something so few believe in anymore. Ms. Rowlings takes us to a real place and allows us to see the true magic within. A must watch for anyone who needs a little magick in their lives!
B0006399FS|1.0|Caveat Emptor: there's a general rule of thumb for reviews for this album: bad or medicore reviews are written by real people, as evidenced by the fact that they have written other reviews. (just click on \\"see all my reviews\\")    In contrast, the 5-star reviews are brief and usually written by people who have written few if any other reviews. Hmmm. Very, very suspicious.    It's also very odd that about half of the 5-star reviews are written by people with Hispanic names - and most with only one review written. Perhaps a massive campaign of propaganda and lies was off-shored to Puerto Rico or Mexico.     Also these reviews consistenly refer to the band's 2005 tour, proving that U2 manager Paul McGuinness is saavy at cross-marketing. At least U2 is doing a good job of watching the bottom line.    It's pretty sad that a band that was once one of the greatest in the world has apparently resorted to flooding Amazon with fake reviews. Shame on U2.

0440180295|5.0|This is not an easy book to read, but it is a great book.  What makes it tough to read is that Billy Pilgrim, the main character, \\"comes unstuck in time.\\"  In other words, he is constantly moving from the present, to the past, to the future. . .  You start reading a chapter and you're not sure if your in World War II or in the future, etc.   <br /> <br />The story is about a guy who is a soldier in World War II and is taken prisoner.  He's sent to Dresden and survives the horrible bombing of that city.  After he comes back home, his life is normal, until he becomes unstuck in time.  He's constantly going back to his war experiences or into the future on another planet. <br /> <br />Vonegut has an amazing imagination, a wonderful sense of humor and a gift for telling stories that keep us interested.  I've read most of his books and enjoyed everything I've read by him, but this is still one of his best books ever. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this, try his outstanding collection of short stories, \\"Welcome to the Monkey House.\\"

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Best screwball comedy since Raising Arizona! People say this is a rip off of Wes Anderson...it is similar in style to the Wes Anderson movies but the biggest difference is it's funny. I sat down and watched the Royal Tennenbaums again after seeing Napoleon and it was a yawn-fest in comparison. Jon Heder is amazing in this role, he so utterly immerses himself into the character that it is scary to see him without the hairdo and mouth-breathing. Buy this and make a backup of it because you'll wear it out!
B000001Y42|5.0|This is a great cd by Limp Bizkit i could care less what anyone else says about them. All the songs are awsome and DJ Lethal just kicks A!

B00005JLEX|1.0|Skip the first couple of seasons, they're terrible. The jokes aren't that funny and neither are the actors. Kramer is barely the Kramer we recognize him as later. Seinfeld is a show about nothing, and nothing is exactly how much money you should spend on these  dvds.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I've gotnothing against Duran Duran, but Zeppelin is in another realm compared to DD. What was SSF drinking while s/he wrote the review? <br /> <br />Zep illustrated how well it could improvise, something that not all bands can do, certainly not Duran Duran. They showed who influenced them and made the songs rock. They also played their classics and brought the crowd to its feet...you can hear it in the background.  <br /> <br />These concerts would have been amazing to attend. I'm sorry I was born too late. <br /> <br />Buy this album.
B000286RNY|5.0|first off, giving this movie 5 stars does not mean its on par with \\"the godfather\\" or anything like that. but for what it is, this movie kicks butt. the humor in the movie is offbeat and strange but very funny. also, the visual effects are great. but the thing i really like about this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously at all and is just loads of fun.  <br /> <br />p.s....if you're one who likes to toke and watch a flick, this is one you should get
B00005JMAH|5.0|My first thought is to mention that although the book scared me to death (and I loved every minute of it!), the film was far less sinister. Nevertheless, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n brillantly captures the mood of Azkaban in this third installment of the Harry Potter film series.<br /><br />A few elements that stick out in my mind -- (1) watching Emma Thompson as the mystical and eccentric Professor Trelawney. She really captured the essence of this character beautifully in what is no doubt an unusual role for her. (2) The time-turn sequence with Emma Watson and Danielle Radcliffe -- absolutely BRILLIANT!!!!!!!! It really ties together several loose variables in the film. I just wish they explained a bit more about Hermoine's class overload and why the necklace was indeed a necessity for her. In the film it seemd like more of a novelty object than a necessary tool. (3) new cast members David Thewils as Professor Lupin and Michael Gambon ias Dumbledore. Both were excellent, although I do miss Richard Harris' on screen presence.<br /><br />Prisoner of Azkaban is a wonderful, exciting, fast-paced adventure. It was wonderful to see how much the original three actors have matured through the years, both physically and professionally. Definitely worth the price!<br /><br />Cris Cunningham
B000669GAI|5.0|Welcome, ladies and gents, prepubescent young boys and girls alike, to the musical contest of the CENTURY!!!  Tonight's fight will feature two of the most heinously popular rock groups of the 1990s, clashing mightily in a contest to expose which `Greatest Hits' package will rise to superiority over the failing party.<br /><br />In the corner to my left, let me introduce Creed's greatest hits, splendidly titled \\"Creed: Greatest Hits\\"! This collection weighs in at a near-pathetic 13 tracks, which include some of the biggest hits from one of the biggest bands in recent memory (of Creed's three recorded albums, 23 million total copies have been sold worldwide).  A bonus DVD helps to give this album a bit more bite to its bark, toting three live performances and Creed's entire collection of videos.  Slightly impressive, but \\"Creed: Greatest Hits\\" somehow seems a bit of a lightweight competitor, never mind how many albums they've sold.<br /><br />In the opposing corner, let me introduce Pearl Jam's \\"Rearviewmirror\\"!!!  Weighing in with 33 of the band's most successful tracks during last 14 years, this double-disc set is divided onto an `Upside' and a `Downside' disc; `Upside' serving as a collection of harder rock songs, and `Downside' stepping up with a plethora of PJ ballads.  With such an obese amount of incredibly emotive, powerful rock anthems on \\"Rearviewmirror\\", it's already beginning to look bad for post-grunge Creed enthusiasts.<br /><br />The bell sounds and the match begins.  Creed starts off with its album's strongest track, `Torn', which rocks slowly and moodily, building to a powerful crescendo . . . until Pearl Jam leaps into action, whipping out a scathing triple-combo from the `Upside' disc: `Once', `Even Flow', and `Alive'.  Each of these legendary songs systematically beat, pound, poke and slam `Torn' into the dust, utterly stripping it of any redeeming qualities by simply taking the same rage, same mood and same rowdiness that `Torn' utilizes, and then transcends it until it's an exhilarating, majestic, and effectively elegant rage, mood and rowdiness.  The anger in `Once' is unequaled and nearly tangible; the frustration in `Even Flow' bleeds from each note and lyric; the majesty of `Alive' is impossible in every emotional and musical aspect, and `Torn' is reduced to nothing, stumbling to it's small corner in disbelief and shame.<br /><br />For each song Creed presents in it's defense, Pearl Jam has three more to destroy it.  The heavy crunching of Creed's `Bullets' explodes and singes the air, but PJ's `Animal', `Do The Evolution' and `State of Love and Trust' wrestles it to the ground and beats it mercilessly, utilizing incredible passion to great effect.  The hypnotically affecting `Jeremy' and pleading power of `Corduroy' peel Creed's `My Own Prison' apart like a rotten banana.  For every `Arms Wide Open' from Creed, Pearl Jam unleashes an unrealistically beautiful `Black', or a patently euphoric `Man of the Hour', or a relentlessly sincere `Elderly Woman...', or the gorgeous magnificence of `Nothingman', (all courtesy of the `Downside' disc) to smack it around like a sterile, soggy tennis ball.<br /><br />Which isn't to say Creed doesn't put up a fairly strong fight.  The first four tracks on Creed's `hits' album are among the best songs the band ever produced.  The music videos are a nice touch too, but all of them together still can't scratch the immortal surface of Pearl Jam's own `Jeremy' video.  The three live songs are pretty cool, but ultimately fail to bring anything new to the original tracks.<br /><br />In short, it's obvious that this fight was entirely unfair.  Each and every song (almost) that Pearl Jam presents to the listener on \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is improvement on perfection.  Creed has garnered a ridiculous amount of success in its short history, and while their music is sometimes powerful and engaging, it can't stand against Pearl Jam.  If you asked Santa for any `Greatest Hits' package lastyear, it should've been \\"Rearviewmirror\\".' package last year, it should've been \\"Rearviewmirror\\".
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I expected great things from \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" as it came from the makers of \\"Spaced\\", the finest sitcom of the past decade.  I was not disappointed - it's surreal, packed with references, true to life, incredibly funny, ironic, warm, quite scary and extremely well directed, acted and edited.   <br /> <br />I won't go any further except to observe that none of the other reviews mention \\"Spaced\\".  ANY fan of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" will LOVE \\"Spaced\\".  Bizarrely, it's not available on Amazom.com. So, go to Amazon.co.uk, and order the Spaced Collector's Edition along with this movie.  I GUARANTEE neither purchase will disappoint you!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Ive been waiting for ever to see a comedy worth seeing, and my friends this is it.  Its the funniest movie ive ever seen, throughout the whole film i actually did not stop laughing, seriously its that funny.  And it actually some other quality to it other then humor, it actually some good performances esspecialy from the guy who played shaun.  And it even has some shcok value too, not much just the guy getting his guts ripped out toward the end, that was crazy, everything else is hilarious.  Take it from me this is the only comedy EVER worth watching more then once or even at all.  And its really the only zombie movie worth watching too, i mean come on house of the dead? dawn of the dead, 28 days later and nothing happens, the list goes on, THEY ALL SUCK.  I give this an 9 out of a 10, the only flaw is its too short, but definetly i will consider buying this if i can get money, and then it would also be the only comedy i own.
B000007MVX|4.0|I bought A Passion Play in 1978. Many kinds of music came over the same radio station then: Messiaen, Penderecki and Stockhausen played alongside Sun Ra, Miles and Revolutionary Ensemble on college radio. Commercial stations played rock albums, not just songs.  <br /> <br />Commercial music now sports rigid genres and a return to hit singles. A Passion Play is not radio fare today. Many 45-minute, multi-movement pieces have been written in the past 200 years, and more are written each year: few were composed for a five piece rock band, fewer still recorded and marketed by a major label. <br /> <br />Listen to A Passion Play after Thick as a Brick, Jethro Tull's earlier album-length continuous work, written by Ian Anderson but also arranged and perhaps in places even co-written by the entire group. A Passion Play sounds instead like it was composed throughout by one man and interpreted by the group. There is a coherent musical voice here that is more evident in Thick as a Brick's poetry than its music. The different sounds of the band and voices outline the structure of the work, not obscure it as in Thick as a Brick. Even when the band stretches out in the extended sax duet, the harmony and rhythms build toward and achieve a goal, leaving us somewhere different than where we began. The opening \\"There was a hush...,\\" sounding as if written out note-for-note, returns seamlessly at the end out of the raunchiest guitar sounds Martin Barre ever produced. <br /> <br />Every few minutes, between passages of earthy acoustic beauty, A Passion Play rocks, and rocks hard. Jethro Tull improved upon Thick as a Brick with this record, and created timeless music. Luckily for us, they did it in the right decade.
B000268QB2|4.0|This has got to be one of those albums you either love to love or love to criticise.  I have read most of the reviews here and would agree with most of the comments both negative and positive.  Yes most of the music does sound like it has fallen out of the 'soaring melody' machine but so what and as someone else said these guys don't sound like anything else around at the moment and therefore it is unfair to compare with great bands of old. <br />This is a great debut album full of snappy songs with catchy humable melodies unfortunately the lyrics are crap but I am still waiting for the follow-up. <br />So does this help ? probably not.  If you are a fan of British music like only the Brits can do and you want to hear something different that you can actually sing along to then this is an excellent buy.  If you like your music a little heavier or you think that the best thing out of the UK at the moment is Franz Ferdinand then you wiill find this like a cup of lukeward tea.
B00003W8NM|5.0|No question this is one of the top 10 movies of all time.  If you get past all of the idiots that start rambling off the rules when you mention this movie to them, there is a lot to take in.  Be it all of Brad Pitt's strange actions in the background or the obvious Buddhist over tone.  This is far from just a fighting movie it will really make you think and is a must have, if you have the time I strongly recommend the book as well.
B00004T9UF|5.0|when i first heard eminem, i thought of him as an average rapper but as he continued to release new songs, i began to grow on him. marshall mathers l.p. is eminem's first and probably last promising and truthful albums. the eminem show was alright but it didn't reach the standards that marshall mathers l.p. received. encore, i hear, is just plain garbage. <br /> <br />many have heard the touching stan song, using heavy bass along with an heavenly voice by dido. his lyrics are the best i've seen with him and i don't think he'll be able to create another song using incredible lyrical talent like that (see the lyrics involving the story about phil collins' 'in the air tonight'). other cuts that rock the mic are the way i am, marshall mathers, drug ballad, criminal and i'm back. he speaks very much about problems in his life (especially his wife, kim), his daughter, his mother, disrespect towards anyone disrespecting him and death. <br />kim, to me, was too personal to record and shouldn't have been included on the album. the lyrics are way too harsh and immediately paint a picture of exactly what eminem is saying. <br /> <br />i'm not saying eminem is a bad rapper, i actually have a lot of respect for him for what he went through because he showed the world, especially the black people, that he could rise to the top. but some of the trash he's releasing today by himself and with his group, d-12, gets you wondering, \\"is he ever going to release more truthful songs?\\". the marshall mathers l.p., to me, is a classic album and should have received a 5 mic in the source magazine. that's how good this album is, according to my calculations.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Like A Prayer, Madonna's fourth studio effort, released in the spring of 1989, was the album Ms. Ciccone got down to business. She was 30, the age at which her mother had died of cancer, and she also was recently departed from an abusive marriage to Sean Penn. These facts, along with the fact that she was getting older, made for a more mature recording. Gone were the multiple bracelets, the Boy Toy belt buckles, and the Material Girl. This was her Rubber Soul. <br />From the opening hard-rock chords of the title track, you know you're in for something unique and refreshing. The gospel choir, chunky guitar, organs, and handclaps of the haunting 'Like A Prayer,' is followed by the deep funky bass riffs and jubilant horn section of 'Express Yourself,' making for a knockout punch opener. Following this is the much-touted but ultimately disappointing Madonna-Prince collabo, 'Love Song,' perhaps a mid-tempo extension of 'Express Yourself.' After this, Madonna lays bare her marriage to Sean Penn in the bitter, sarcastic 'Til Death Do Us Part,' a B-side to the hit 'Dear Jessie.' She next discusses her mother's death in 'Promise To Try,' which packs an emotional wallop, and ends the first half of the record. <br /> <br />'Cherish' is up-tempo, simple, joyous pop, which demonstrates Madonna's penchant for hooky, cheerful pop numbers. 'Dear Jessie' does 'Sgt. Pepper' just as good as Lennon and McCartney. 'Oh Father,' which spawns from the closing notes of 'Dear Jessie,' is a dirge-like ballad about Madonna's father. 'Keep It Together,' a pseudo-hip-hop song about family unity, is very good, but seems almost weak compared to Madonna's other work here. 'Pray For Spanish Eyes,' a B-side to the flop single 'Oh Father,' has to be one of Madonna's most underappreciated gems, a ballad about the demise of a gang member, with tender acoustics added. And then, the astonishing closer. 'Act of Contrition' mixes the like-titled Catholic prayer with new lyrics, chants from 'Like A Prayer' played backwards, handclaps, heavy guitars, and moans played at random. It ends with Madonna yelling about her reservations in heaven. It tees up the album perfectly, and will stand as one of music's highest achievements. <br /> <br />
0395389496|5.0|I first read this book when I was about 6 years old and I still remember it as clearly as I had then. The soft watercolors, the hot cocoa the children drink on the train and the little boy who wanted nothing more than a bell from one of the reindeer. This book is pure magic, and so beautiful. I don't even celebrate Christmas, so imagine the impact of a child reading the book for the first time, a child who still believes in the dream of Santa. The ending is just vague enough to be mysterious yet so clear even for the smallest to understand. The somewhat sad atmosphere of the book is enough to have tears rolling down your cheeks by the end of this incredibly sweet story. I absolutely love it; it is a book with one of those eternal, timeless themes that, whatever your age, religion or country, is still inspiring. It's theme of a poignant, childish belief carried on forever whatever anyone else said or believed is incredibly touching. It is, in effect, an indescribable work of exquisite art.<br /><br />I would advise anyone reading this review to buy this book, no matter what.<br /><br />As a side note, the movie looks disappointing. It seems to have lost the beautifully sad mood of the story, but as I haven't watched it yet I don't really know.
1400032717|5.0|The increbile accomplishment of this book is how it lets you see the world you think you know through the fears, beliefs and dislikes of another human being. And through Christopher's eyes, the world looks like a very different place, and yet familiar at the same time. Haddon's true insight are not into how the mind of an autistic boy works, but rather into our own beliefs and actions. This is a poignant book about the way we organize our lives by assigning value to some things and not others. Christopher always has an answer as to why he does one thing rather than another. Do you? <br /> <br />It often takes an outsider to really see how something is working. Christopher is able to uncover those inner workings with an uncanny depth, just by asking the obvious questions. This book is a lesson in understanding people like Christopher and people like ourselves.
B000006TRV|5.0|I was just browsing through some of these reviews and noticing that they're usually either 5 stars or 1 star. The reason for this is because The Wall happens to be the most complex album ever recorded. You either have the intelligence to comprehend it or you don't, it's that simple. Roger Waters is a genius when it comes to writing. Even if you find him to be egotistical, he shines as a lyricist. I really feel sorry for the people reviewing this and only realizing the melodies, yet failing to understand the complete story being told. This is a piece that requires your full attention and asks you to think a little bit about the subject matter. Also, the subtle little things that pop up throughout the album make it that much more brilliant for those who are able to pick up on them. The sound effects that accompany the songs allow it to draw people into the work and delve deeper into the mind of the character's experiences. It really makes you feel as if you just have to stand by and watch as everything is happening: You want to reach in and lend a hand but you're unable to affect the outcome, like a bystander in an ongoing war, witnessing the horror from a safe haven.<br /><br />This is definitely the thinking man's music. Eloquence personified.
068987474X|5.0|\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" exposes the truth behind why men act the way they do. Simply put, if he doesn't call you when he said he would, and he doesn't want to be intimate with you, even if you are dating, then he's just not that into you. I've found that women make excuses for their men, because they want to believe that they are into them...but this book is definently a wake-up call, to say that \\"Hey, if he's doing this, then he's maybe not into me?\\" I have read this book recently (finished it in a night) and found that my ex-boyfriend is all over this book, but I was too naive at the time to realize that he just wasn't into me, because I was too busy buying time to find excuses for him. This book is an excellent read, exposing the truth behind men's \\"hidden meanings\\".
0395389496|3.0|This book was given to us as a gift for our child.<br /><br />It's my observation that the underlying message of this book is to present the idea of faith to a child.  Santa is a terrible example of Faith. Santa is NOT real, if the child takes this book to heart, this example will evenually let him/her down.  If his/her faith is shattered here, where does it end?<br /><br />I STRONGLY disagree with the reviewer who said to use this book when your child questions Santa.  To use this book to enforce the believe in Santa is to lie to your child.  Children have \\"faith\\" in what their parents tell them. If you directly mislead them, how would you feel when you discovered the truth? It would hurt A LOT  more than finding out Santa isn't real!  I'm not suggesting answering their query by revealing that he's make believe, but maybe respond indirectly, possibly in the form of a question, leaving the final answer up to them.<br /><br />I that if the faith/bell ringing were to be left out, It would be a solid 4 star adventure!  The story is decent, and the artwork exceptional.  But the flaw is still there. If presented too young, your child will be exposed to questioning Santa before necessary, if presented too late, they're mislead.  It's a catch 22, and it's really a shame.<br /><br />Still, I give it 3 Stars with a WARNING to parents on how it's presented to your child.  And of course, if your likes trains, they'll love the book!
B000001GPW|5.0|The fervent sense of dramatis personae in these difficult passages of these dissonant piano concerts demands the most exigent domain of the instrument as well a notable conductor.<br /><br />When Bartok stated in 1905 : The dissonance ` s empire is mine , certainly he was so far from being lying .<br /><br />Ferenc Fricsay and Geza Anda gave the best of their craftsmanship to record one of the most notable and above all idiomatic readings of these concerts .<br /><br />But besides , if you get the Piano Concerts with Gyorgy Sandor (The Complete Piano Concerts with Michael Gielen in the fifties) and a hard to find recording with Fricsay in 1955 with The Vienna Synphony , you will have the essential spirit of this notable composers . But these recordings are priority.<br /><br />In addition , I recommend you a hidden and two distant recordings of Sandor Ormandy in the Bartok Premiere Third piano and the historic Barok Premiere Third Piano concerto in Europe given for the couple Louis Kentner - Adrian Boult  . There was an outstanding Hungarian pianist in the thirties named Edith Farnadi who recorded an excels Liszt but I have got nothing about Bartok , but after listening to her it will be hard to fail ; as well any recording made for Annie Fisher , Zoltan Kocsis and more recently Andras Schiff .<br /><br />It is not a mere casuality all these named performers are Hungarian . The only point to remark is to these last interpreters that to make a journey with Bela Bartok demands a conduction and such level of commitment that hardly you will be able to find after Fricsay and Kertesz 's deaths .<br /><br />You may argue than Georg Solti and  Istvan Kertesz were remarkable conductors. Yes indeed but I have always thought Solti was an overrated director and besides Solti and Kertesz established with Bartok a distant approach . Solti conducted more Orchestral pieces than Kertsesz but ironically they never found a high caliber pianist to play Bartok piano concertos<br /><br />Acquire this set . It will reward you. I give you my word.rd you. I give you my word. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Missing out. That's what you will be if you dont go out and buy this movie, at least see it. I saw it at the Maui Film Festival Summer 2004, it was a hit. By far the best movie they showed!!! Great acting with a stunning role by \\"Napoleon\\". Go out and see it. It's my new favorite movie, and believe me if stores are all sold out on the first day, its gotta be good.
0380789035|5.0|When I first read American Gods I was impressed by how well the book was crafted, but it also spoke to me on an emotional level.  I was in a really bad place in my life.  In some of the reviews for this book I have read on Amazon they say that Shadow is a one dimensional, underdeveloped character.  I have to disagree with that assessment, or perhaps to say that that's the point.  Throughout the story Shadow is empty inside, dead inside.  American Gods is the story of how he comes alive, in that way reminiscent of The Sandman, how he comes to make himself a whole person.  I guess that's what I think about when I think about American Gods, not the idea of new gods against old gods, and gods slowly dying from lack of belief, I think about Shadow becoming a person, a process many of us are still struggling with.  I believe American Gods to be a fantastically written, extremely well crafted novel, but that's to be expected of Gaiman.  Instead I choose to say this novel is a creature of hope.  But perhaps, coming from Gaiman, that too was to be expected.

B00002E233|3.0|\\"Jaws\\" was a masterpiece of suspense where the classic tale of man vs. beast was played out in the fashion of \\"Moby Dick\\" or \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" The characters and the characterization of the shark were built to an incredible climax to rank with the greatest movie showdowns of all time. Forget about such artistry with this gore fest.<br /><br />Aquatica is a research facility where a cure for Alzheimer's disease is attempting to be developed. However, along the way the sharks get really smart and decide they want to be free to roam the world's oceans and eat people at will. What follows is a relatively shallow monster movie with little to recommend it other than the digital special effects. The acting is shallow and the characters are stereotypical, including the gorgeous female needing to strip to her undies for some semi-plausible reason. The broadest character is LL Cool J, who plays a cook for comic relief. At least we understand his motivations are to be funny and survive to get back to dry land. Everyone else comes with monster movie baggage and we are just bored with their story, and probably care little about it anyway.<br /><br />The real and only interest in this movie are the digital shark effects, which in a few places border on the cheesy and put what could have been a first class movie into a B-movie category. Watch this movie as you would any other monster-movie gore fest, with a sense of humor and low expectations of the plot.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This album rocks. Green Day shines in the CD. This is by far the best album I've heard in Decades! Reminiscent of a mix of 60's rock and 80's punk, with Green Day's unique flair.
068987474X|5.0|After reading some reviews I've come to the conclusion that a lot of people are missing the point of the book.  This book wasn't written for every person and it wasn't written to say that all men lie in relationships.  It was written for the percentage of people who struggle with boyfriends or girlfriends who make up excuses instead of being honest in relationships.  I don't think the book was intended as a how-to book on dating.  For the people who think the book is stupid from title to finish, I congratulate you on never finding yourself in a relationship with someone who makes up excuses and lies to you.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot is a good band with a awesome singer and drummer. The whole mask thing is gone stale, they don't need the masks because people just dismiss the band as talentless freaks but if they ditch the masks, more and more people will respect their music.
B00030590I|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie!  In fact I felt so confident that I would like it - I bought it instead of renting it and I'm glad I did.  The movie is beautiful, creative and captivating.  It is similar to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in that the characters do fly around when they fight, but the movie itself tells a very different story (or stories).  In some ways I liked this movie better than Crouching Tiger.  I highly recommend this movie for Martial Arts Fans!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Matrix films - I know of no other trilogy that is as spectacular to watch or as intellectually engaging as these are. That said - the Matrix Reloaded was a slight disappointment to me, definitely not as strong as either the first movie or Revolutions. <br /> <br />The first Matrix is one of those rare films that has no weak point. It's absolutely captivating the whole way through. Revolutions is also not far behind. I can't say the same of Reloaded though. Whilst the most important of the three in terms of plot development and visually and technically very impressive there are scenes which are either too long or just plain unneccessary which spoil the overall viewing experience. Once you've seen it a couple of times you really can dispense with the first half hour of the film which is painfully slow at times and offers little value in terms of plot or character development. <br /> <br />The freeway chase was technically very impressive but if you've seen one big car chase you've kinda seen them all.... it didn't really offer anything new or terribly exciting for me and I felt even viewing it for the first time in the cinema it dragged a little... Some of the shots of Trinity on the bike you can see she's only riding along at about 10 mph!! The burly brawl was fabulous eye-candy but I do accept other reviewers criticisms that it went on a little too long for Neo just to fly away at the end. <br /> <br />Being the middle of three, the movie has the tough job of unravelling what is a brilliant, but multi-layered, complicated plot whilst upping the special-effects ante from it's predecessor. It acheives this well for the most part but suffers from an audience perspective in trying to be almost *too* clever. The answers it delivers are either almost riddle-like or just plain overcomplicated. The Architect speech at the end was the most important point in the entire trilogy but the rhetoric took several viewings to fully digest what was being said and it's implications. This is fine for the fans of the Matrix who are prepared to re-watch, dicuss and look for the answers to their questions, but it alienates the more casual viewer from the Matrix world. This is a shame because the viewing experience of Revolutions becomes richer the more you understand Reloaded. <br /> <br />The first Matrix and Revolutions achieved a perfect harmony of superb plot and jaw-dropping special effects, but Reloaded is a little far behind these two here. It was given a lot to do in terms of plot and special effcts and whilst it tries hard, it finds the load on it's shoulders a little too heavy at times which results in it losing it's way a little at various points. A great movie, a great Matrix movie, but not as strong as one or three.
B00005QCYC|4.0|JURASSIC PARK is a great movie that comes along once a generation. What's to criticize?... Nothing! THE LOST WORLD received mostly good reviews. I personally liked it as much if not better than the first. It had a great story with some new and returning dinosaurs along with the \\"T-Rex in San Francisco\\" which is definately a memorable scene of the movie. JURASSICK PARK 3 is the misfit of the trilogy. I liked the third installment but I must agree with the many viewers who felt that the length of the movie was cut too short. Plus, the action packed violence and intensity is missing from the first two movies. On a positive note, adding new and intelligent dinosaurs worked out good even if the intelligence level does seem a bit much. While JURASSICK PARK 3 leaves more to be desired, the trilogy is overall good. I enjoy these movies even more watching them in the order of Jurassick Park 1, 3, and 2. Try me on this one! I hope Jurassick Park 4 is in the works.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Worst. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br />I feel like an hour and 26 minutes was stolen from me. <br /> <br />
B00004XMS0|4.0|The Batman movies have always gotten mixed reviews. BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were mostly looked upon as being great yet too dark. BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN&ROBIN have received major mixed reviews with the fourth movie receiving most of the negative reviews. Well, here is my personal review of each film. BATMAN is just about perfect in every aspect. Great story, great acting, not childish, and a dark tone that suits the movie. BATMAN RETURNS to me ranks up with the first. The dark tone is a bit more emphasized but it doesn't ruin the movie at all in my opinion. The acting is good, especially  Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (hear her roar!) and the story holds up as well. BATMAN FOREVER is different from the first two in the sense of not having a very detailed story, a lighter tone, and of course the arrival of Robin. Though somewhat fast-paced, the story still is good and Val Kilmer did just as good of a job playing Batman as did Michael Keaton. Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones bring so much personality to the characters of Riddler and Two Face. Aside from certain differences, this still ranks up with the first two movies. As for BATMAN&ROBIN, I realize that there were some noticable flaws. However, I have no problem overlooking them since I am a Batman fan. This movie is the first of the four to have a few plot holes but it's really not enough to ruin the overall film. A number of people hated George Clooney replacing Val Kilmer but again, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie because George did manage to do a decent job. Some situations were very predicatable and the villans acted a bit cartoony but being a fan of Uma Thurman and Arnold Schwarzenegger I personaly enjoyed seeing them play the villans. BATMAN&ROBIN also brings about the character of Batgirl. Despite the flaws, this movie still manages to entertain just as the others. I would like there to be yet another sequel to the franchise though it probably won't happen due to the fourth Batman not doing so good at the box office. I think the reason that some were displeased with the last two Batman films is because the tone and style somewhat changed but overall a Batman fan should definately enjoy all four.
B000007OY0|5.0|This is a movie where everything works. The movie is quite unique in that it is the only movie based on a Stephen King book where the movie is actually better than the written word. The story, the acting, the message of hope and the scenery out of the prison are all compelling. The ending of the movie is just fantastic.<br /><br />The movie can be viewed again and again. It has so much substance that the viewer does not become bored. On the various lists of the top movies of all time it is near the top of the lists.
B00006IU73|5.0|In Absentia,is in a word incredible. My band for the new millenium,next to King Crimson. For all you dusty,old guys out there(I'm 50 so what) please quit comparing PT to a 70's prog band, or Pink Floyd,Yes,Genesis etc.etc. They are a band that has been influenced by a number of musicians. That's how it all starts,man. How can that be a bad thing? \\"Sky moves Sideways\\" is their masterpiece (2003 digipack) If you want the aforementioned bands buy them here at Amazon and play them. When the rubber hits the road, there is not a better band out there right now. Peace.
B000002W9Q|5.0|The Dirty Dancing soundtrack is the best CD in the history of the world!! The song on it are amazing and I absolutely love them!

B0000C8AW2|5.0|This album is extremely challenging.  Dylan wrote here what I consider his greatest material until maybe `Time Out of Mind.'  Unfortunately, it was released in the midst of a music world dominated by The Sex Pistols, Devo, and Disco.  I always maintained that if he had released this material as an accoustical album instead of whatever this is, then he would have blown everyone's mind royally.  But instead, at the time no one could stand to listen to the music long enough to mine out the brilliant lyrics. It was severely panned by the critics and he went away wounded and wrote `Slow Train Coming'  Too bad.  There's is at least four songs here that sent chills down my spine:  `Changing of the Guards', `No Time to Think', `Senor'  and `Where Are You Tonight?'   Read the lyrics to the first. <br /> <br />   CHANGING OF THE GUARDS.  Sixteen years. Sixteen banners united over the field where the good shepherd grieves. Desperate men, desperate women divided spreading their wings beneath the falling leaves. Fortune calls. I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace.  Merchants and thieves hungry for power.  My last deal gone down. She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born on a midsummer's eve, near the tower. <br />  The cold-blooded moon. The captain waits above the celebration sending his thoughts to a beloved maid whose ebony face is beyond communication. The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  They shaved her head. She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo. A messenger arrived with a black nightingale. I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow... follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil. <br />  I stumbled to my feet. I rode past destruction in the ditches with the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo. Renegade priests and treacherous young witches were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  The palace of mirrors where dog soldiers are reflected, the endless road and the wailing of chimes, the empty rooms where her memory is protected, where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times. <br />  She wakes him up.  Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks. She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking. He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks. <br />  \\"Gentlemen,\\" he said, \\"I don't need your organization.  I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards, but Eden is burning!  Either brace yourself for elimination or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards. <br />  \\"Peace will come with tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire, but will bring us no reward when her false idols fall and cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating between the King and the Queen of Swords.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|Sure, you've heard Vertigo ad nauseum, but it is still a kick a$$ riff.  The first four songs will grab ahold of you right away and not let go.  There is the beauty and introspection of \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it\\" and the sonic attacks of \\"Vertigo\\" \\"Love and Peace\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", these songs alone are worth the price of admission.  If you're like me, it may take a couple of listens for the middle of the album to grow on you but you'll be fine again once you get to \\"Crumbs\\" and the end of the album.  \\"Original of the Species\\" begins with the gorgeous piano, reminiscent of a child's music box and is a gorgeous ode from a parent to a child growing up before their eyes.  The accompaniment sounds a little bit like the Beatles, obviously quite a compliment.  The reflective yet upbeat \\"Yahweh\\" is a perfect ending to the CD, hopeful yet conscious of the troubles in the world.  Also, I highly recommend getting the deluxe version for the addition of \\"Fast Cars\\" it is a great tune.      If you are a long time U2 fan, you will not be disappointed at all.  If you discovered U2 with \\"All that You Can't Leave Behind\\" you will find the boys pick up right where they left off-namely sounding at the top of their form.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Although it was considered by few persons as a \\"downfall for Pearl Jam's music\\" No Code is one of the best albums of the band, the people that criticize this album don't know anything about music and are \\"creed\\" fans or something like that..they only value what's commercial, and they don't value music as an expression or worst, they don't know what is like  to improve their music or elevate their spirit, with this record PJ prooved to be a very talented, elevated band looking to make more complex and better music, regardless the commercial spotlight; PJ has prooven by far that they do not need a hit single or a video or a record deal no more, they are the best rock band of the 90's and 2000's and they have'nt make noise the commercial way because they simply don't care...one thing is to respect likes and dislikes of ones mind, and other very different is to say that PJ is a burnout...
B0002IVN9W|4.0|\\"Funeral\\" drinks like a delicious and thick pea soup, it is both heartily nourishing and outrageously addicting, at once. At points, it can be bloodthirstily furious in its throaty and saturated delivery, while at others, it is dangerously close to shattering in its tinkering and thomping display of desperate shouts interlaced with strategically tapped upon tambourines. It opens up as damn well light and pop-like as orchestral indie rock can get, to pull you in like the aroma of bittersweet chocolate wafting from the gallows of a British warship, then pelts you unrelentlessly, over and over again, with heart-breakingly confusing and heavy songs about the utter despair resounding from the pitious dark corners of mankind. The first four songs are subtitled aptly, Neighborhoods 1, 2, 3, and 4, cruelly broken up by \\"Une Anne Sans Lumire\\", just to confuse the hell out of the listener to the point of tears. After the twenty-seventh listen of this album, the listener might begin to refer to the first five tracks of this album as the \\"warm-up\\" tracks, because they really only serve to get you all hot and sweaty for the real meat of this piece, the second half, a.k.a. \\"The Fantastic Four, +1\\". Here you have the stand-outs of this album, and perhaps the stand-outs of indie rock in general this year, the operatic and heart-breakingly dismal \\"Crown of Love\\", the balladic to stomp-foot rockin' \\"Wake Up\\", the mediocre, Bjork-vocaled \\"Hati\\", the miraculously catchy \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\", followed by the sum of all that is pure in the world of over-six minute songs, \\"In the Back Seat\\". I'm not going to just stark, flat-out lie to you in the face, at some point during the listen to this album, you may just start crying. Despite all of its high-points, \\"Funeral\\" is far from perfect in many ways. It gets tedious, especially in the front-end of the album, a real blur of song-writing which, while having four songs having the same theme is cute as a bunny, results in four songs that aredamn well the exact same song. In fact, to have to refer to the album as having a \\"good part\\" equates to the album having a \\"just damn mediocre part\\", and that equates to four whole tracks. Does the fact that the last five songs are almost the pinnacle of song-writing greatness negate the mediocrity of other points of the album? Well, it's not that they're \\"bad\\" in any sense of the word, but their lack of colour and somewhat blandness sucks the energy from the rest of the album like a black hole. Hey, this can be overlooked though, especially when the second half of the album is so pristine and succulently delicious. \\"Funeral\\", especially when taken with consideration of their grandiose EP released earlier, shows superb promise for this Canadian band, promise which shall inevitably bring a mass of riled, intoxicated, incensed fans in their wake. <br /> <br />The Album itself comes in the new-stylin', crazy-indie, to-hell-with-plastic, Cardboard Flap disc holder, a real tribute to the achievements of mankind. Inside the flaps are an almost promotional and nearly melodramatic and epic re-telling poster of the Arcade Fire's glorious voyage through the world.
B0007OCG56|1.0|Hell hath no fury like a filmmaker scorned, apparently. At least that's what seems to be going on with James L. Brooks -- his latest film \\"Spanglish\\" feels like a tirade against a despised ex (which, rumor has it, it is). Paz Vega injects a bit of likability into the plot, but this comedy just seems like a bitter ride into marital dysfunction.<br /><br />Flor (Paz Vega) and her daughter emigrate to the United States, hoping for a better life. They find employment for Jamie Oliver-like John Clasky (Adam Sandler) and his neurotic wife Deborah (Tea Leoni), who have a very weird marriage -- he is a loving husband and father, with too much pressure; she is a screeching harridan who bugs her pudgy daughter to lose weight.<br /><br />Flor doesn't speak English, and the Claskys don't speak Spanish; her bilingual child has to translate for them. But a friendship starts to bloom between Flor and John, as Deborah starts to woo Flor's pretty young daughter away from her, and alienates her own daughter.<br /><br />A comedy that bangs you over the head with a message is bad enough. A comedy that just bangs you over the head is even worse. This is another one of the mature Adam Sandler movies -- you know, the ones where he is called on to play a non-dolt. Unfortunately, this movie isn't worthy of such an attempt.<br /><br />While the movie technically revolves around Flor and John's lives, the obnoxious self-absorbed Deborah dominates the plot. If you can get past Brooks' ridiculous bitterness, there actually a smothered message in the story about Flor. Unfortunately, it seems to be that if a person immigrates to the US, they shouldn't consider it \\"their\\" country, or let their kids do so. The writing has a few good lines (especially from Deborah's alcoholic mother), but stays tepid most of the time.<br /><br />Tea Leoni isn't a terribly good actress, but she's given a positively loathsome character in Deborah -- she's obsessed with her body, ignorant of others' feelings, and obnoxious even in the bedroom. (Yes, Brooks takes us THERE) Sandler's so-so performance is overshadowed by Leoni's harpy performance, especially since you can't see why he's such a devoted husband. Only Paz Vega gives a performance of real nuance and ability.<br /><br />The bile that spews all over \\"Spanglish\\" keeps it from being a moderately charming love/family comedy. Save your issues for your therapist, John. They don't make for good movies.ks takes us THERE) Sandler's so-so performance is overshadowed by Leoni's harpy performance, especially since you can't see why he's such a devoted husband.

B0001ZMWQO|1.0|I do not know but after listening to Franz Ferdinand I noticed that they are a complete rip off of Interpol, and a bad one since after 10-15 listening you will hate them, do yourslef a favor go get interpol that is where they got their inspiration example. Interpol \\"Slow Hands. [...] <br />sounds a lot like \\"darts of pleasure\\" What they did was take the goth and dark sound of Interpol put a lot of pop hooks on the songs and call it party rock , sounds like the bizzaro nsync <br />And the name of song number five \\"Auf Ashce\\" partly copied from the group the german group Rammstein complete posers which they also have copied from with the heavy riffs listen to \\"Ich Will\\"

B000006Y12|3.0|I personally like probably 8 bands from the Gothenburg scene,but don't find Dark Tranqulillity's early recordings particularly interesting,I personally beleive their first very good album was The Mind's I and everything after that is well worth getting also,unlike In Flames,this group actually got better in my opinion,I guess it comes down to personal taste but to me this album is bland when compared with the bands other offerings
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Some of these reviewers are just totally missing the point of this release. Yes, these are the same songs we've all heard before and maybe there's no need to go out and buy them again. Well guess what? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT! Nobody's putting a gun to your head. If you feel that this exercise in career overview cheapens Young's musical achievements, shut yourself in a room and listen to your treasured vinyl copies of \\"Tonight's The Night\\" or \\"On The Beach\\" or whatever. This release is not for you. It's for casual fans or people who haven't heard any of this music and are curious about checking out some of Neil's songs without having to immediately delve into his extensive back catalogue. I know it's hard for you people to believe that such listeners exist but they are out there. Of course it's better to listen to the albums but a lot of people just don't care enough to bother. This is all they need and want. But what about Decade?? Isn't that a better buy because it is a double CD? Not necessarily. This release has two advantages over Decade:  <br /> <br />1) If you are a casual fan, maybe you don't want a whole double CD of songs. Maybe you just want a single disc with most of the major songs covered. <br /> <br />2) The songs on here have been digitally remastered. This is the reason I bought this CD, despite the fact that I own a lot of Neil's albums already. Because, if you haven't noticed, Young's catalogue (along with the Beatles) is one of the most neglected in popular music. We now have SACD's for Dylan and the Stones but you still can't get a basic remastered copy of, say, Tonight's the Night and After the Goldrush. So until Neil or his label get their acts together and get some reissues happening (On the Beach was a good start but we want the lot thanks), this is the best that these songs are going to sound on CD.  <br /> <br />Cries of \\"sell-out\\" or accusations that Neil is somehow ripping off his fans or degrading his mighty catalogue by releasing thisare ridiculous and totally unwarranted. Every great artist should have a single-disc career overview - it is after all, the best way to give people a taste and maybe convert new fans. I think it's great that people might buy this, hear the greatness of songs like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"The Needle and The Damage Done\\" and then be inspired to check out the actual albums. <br /> <br />Apart from all this, this has been very well compiled. Sure, everyone will have favourites missing - hell, I'd love to hear Come On Baby Let's Go Downtown on here, but we all know it was never going to happen! All of the major high points of Neil's career are covered here - while the disc is playing, it really doesn't feel like anything is missing, and that is a testament to the compilers. All in all, it's a perfect introduction for new listeners and a nice summary for fans (and don't forget it's remastered!)
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Simple music for simple people, thats the way I see it.  Why does everybody praise Avril Lavigne for her songwriting ability?  Do you REALLY think it takes talent to come up with lyrics like \\"Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh/My life's like this/Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh/That's the way it is\\"?  I've never heard such simple rhyme patterns.   <br /> <br />And the subject matter of her songs is SO irratating and whiney!  Every song is the same thing--just whine and complain about how awful life is.  Is THIS why people think Avril is better than Britney Spears???  I'm no fan of hers, but at least there was no miserable angst in her songs.  The overwhelming negativity in all of Avril's songs is just painful!  She just sounds so bitter and miserable.  Yet everybody else just LOVES this bitter complaint rock.  They think it's \\"honest\\" and \\"mature\\".  I hate it.
B00005JNLY|4.0|There is a disclaimer that should be attached to this movie.  If you come into this movie expecting to see a Adam Sandler movie that resembles Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, or even Big Daddy, then you will be incredibly disappointed.  Yes James L. Brooks is one of the writers for The Simpsons, and the writer of Taxi, but this is anything but a slapstick comedy.   <br /> <br />This movie is described perfectly by its title.  Spanglish can mean the lack of communication between cultures, but for this movie it represents the lack of understanding of people's feelings and the lack of communication amongst husband and wife, or a whole family in general.  And yes, there is a lot of spanish spoken to people who don not understand the language.   <br /> <br />The movie is about John Clasky (Sandler) a four-star chef who works nights, and his wife, the neurotic Deborah (Tea Leoni) who is  used to working days. Consequently, they need a little help around the house. Deborah's mother (Cloris Leachman), a washed-up jazz singer who spends her time in the bottom of a wine glass, isn't much help. The Claskys run an ad for a maid and hire Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who so hated to leave her native land for the bustle of Los Angeles that she's never learned English in her six years in America.  The familes relationship is really good until Deborah wants to move into a summer rental home in Malibu.  She wants Flor to tag along, but there is one problem.  Flor has a daughter named Christina, whom she has never mentioned to the Claskys, and Flor doesn't want to leave Christina behind.  So Deborah insists that Christina can also live with the family.  Then the trouble starts.  Deborah takes Christina shopping without Flor's permission.  John gives Christina $640 for finding sea glass.  Flor, being a very proud Mexican lady, does not like the Claskys doing these things for her daughter and becomes upset.  Then new relationships are built, some are destroyed and people learn torespect others wishes. <br /> <br />As for the performances, this is Sandler's best to date.  Tea Lioni does a really good job at being someone that there is no possible way of liking.  Cloris Leachman steals many scenes and is always funny when she is one screen.  She must have had some good guidence from Mel Brooks for all those years.  The stand out performance is Paz Vega.  She cannot express herself too much in words, so most of her expression comes her facial expressions.  Kind of like Johnny Depp in Edward Scissorhands.  She resembles Penelope Cruz a lot, but is a better actress. <br /> <br />The movies itself is really good, one of the years best movies.  The only real problem that I had with the movie is that is seemed to be about 10 minutes long.  Other than that, there was nothing else that bothered me.  James L. Brooks has done is again.  It seems like everytime he starts to write, something good is formed.  And Spanglish may be his best to date.  <br /> <br />

B00005RIKD|5.0|Interesting, experimental, fantastic - so what's new?? If you didn't like this album, and did not appriciate the \\"changes\\" on the old Sting-classics, well yes - that may very well be because you're simply not fan enough, and you listen to these songs without having a particular interest in them, or feel a \\"relationship\\" to what Stings' songwriting and performing is all about; Developing, and growing with time. Change can be good, change can be nessecarry - and change is the future (he says something about this in an interview on his \\"Unplugged\\"-release from 1991 - where he also claims there should be no limitations in the progress of songwriting and performing by categories - all should mix together, and he claims music-\\"experts\\" who says you can't to be wrong. I agree, and here's another example of how superb category-mixing can be. It's jazzy, rockn' roll, heavy, relaxed (as in laid-back music) and most of all gripping. The versions of these songs were rehearsed weeks before the twin towers-tragedy - so this release has got nothing to do with that (some songs being slown down I mean) - if you find a sad \\"expression\\" here, well who wasn't emotionally involved on 11th Septhember, I know I was. If Sting and A&M has made big bucks on the tragedy of 2001, I am sure it was not the intention, or the consept behind the \\"All this time\\"-project.  <br /> <br />Let me add, some versions here are even better, or as good as, the original - I really adore the makeover of \\"Don't stand...\\" and \\"If I ever...\\"!  <br /> <br />Sting-fans, enjoy!
1572524413|5.0|Along with Rififi and Bob Le Flambour, Grisbi is a film no lover of crime flics should miss. The story is simple, Max ( Jean Gabin ) is an aging criminal who has just pulled off a robbery which will set him up in retirement. He knows that time is catching up with him and wishes himself out of the game. Unfortunatly he is stuck with a dim witted partner, Riton ( Rene Dary ) who thinks he carry on as he and Max did in their younger days. <br /> <br />Angelo ( Lino Ventura ) a rival gangster decides that he will cut himself into Max's grisbi (loot) and kidnaps Riton to get at him. Max then has to decide between keeping the loot and his loyalty to Riton and the underworld code of honour. <br /> <br />The great Jean Gabin is on top form as Max, he might to getting on, but this is still a guy you do not wish to mess with. Max might stick to the underworld code of honour but this does not stop him torturing a rival to find what he needs to know. In Max's world what matters is loyalty to your friends, everything else including the way you treat women, comes a distant second. <br /> <br />In this film we see why Max is a criminal. It is because he likes good suits, expensive restaurants, fine wine and beautiful women. Compare this to White Heat where Jimmy Cagney despite pulling off a series of robberies spends most of his time hiding out in cabins in the mountains. <br /> <br />Watch out for a young Jeanne Moreau as Riton's cheating girlfriend. <br /> <br />
B0000AQVCL|4.0|This is a good album and I enjoy listening to it but they steal from so many bands. Their songs either sound like the Rolling Stones, AC/DC, or the Beatles and on Are you gonna be my girl they flat out steal from iggy pop. I mean it is a good album and at least they are making music that sounds like good bands and not all the crap out their today. I just hope on their next album they get all little more original and their song writing gets a little better. If you like this  check out the rock revival band SILVERTIDE!!  down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.

B00006879E|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I have ever bought.  On every cd I own, there are atleast 1 or 2 songs that I skip, but not on this cd.  The combination of Adam's voice and the rock/jazz/rb music sets this cd apart from any other.  I can also relate to all of the lyrics wich is really cool.  I have only had this cd for about 4 weeks, but I have litteraly listened to this cd every day on my to and from work.  It will be a shame if Maroon 5 walks away from the Grammy's without an award.  They are so much more unique than any other band out there right now.  If you buy this cd - you will not be disappointed!
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a truly fantastic album, there are some low parts in it, as there are on all beatles albums (especially on the white album and rubber soul) but the overall album is superb. I think the points about it being influenced heavily by pet sounds are obvious and redundant, as the bands influenced each other (armonies in Back in the USSR for example).  <br /> <br />It is a testament to the quality of the album that Brian Wilson, a person with more more knowldege about good music than any reviewer here, heard this album and stated that there was no point in making music anymore as the beatles had already done it.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|That's all I'm gonna say about the title of this review. He's the man. And in music, few can ever come to him. You have your Ushers and you have your Britneys and you have your Alicia Keys and you have your Justin Timberlakes and then you have Michael Jackson.  <br /> <br />I do believe that the media overshadow parts of him - like his troubling personal life (and who we're fooling, every one of us have had troubling lives, the only reason it's an issue is because Michael's been famous since my sister was born and she's 35 right now), his music videos sometimes take more credit than his actual music (yes MTV made some overlook the fact that Michael Jackson was actually a recording superstar before Thriller's release) and the talk of his face (if the man wants to look like an apple, it's his business - honestly), but this box set has helped us overlook those facts - and rumors - and focus on why he mattered in the first place.  <br /> <br />It's a 35-year chronology of the singer's greatest moments in wax. You can have a dose of good songs mixed with some corny sapp but if you have enough funk to make the place more stinkier than it was when Michael first recorded \\"Off the Wall\\" without taking a bath then you have a great collection of music. <br /> <br />I do feel like \\"Big Boy\\" (his first ever recording and his first as lead singer of the Jackson 5 released to local radio stations in the East Coast in 1968) could've been on here and not the remixed version that was released some time back, the ACTUAL recording of it. Another prob I had is I felt like four discs wasn't enough. I mean, the man had like 70-some hit singles in total as members of the legendary teen group, the Jackson 5, and the underrated soul/funk band, the Jacksons, and as a soloist. It's tough to put together 4 music discs in exchange for record charts. <br /> <br />It look like the man can pack in 6 or 7 discs worth of hits and that'll be the ultimate collection and they could put \\"Who's Loving You\\", \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\", \\"The Love You Save\\", \\"Rockin' Robin\\", \\"Just a Little Bit of You\\", \\"With a Child's Heart\\", and \\"One Day In Your Life\\" in there.  <br /> <br />And there could've been a little more Jacksons appreciation - \\"Show You the Way to Go\\" was one of the group's best records during the first few records they made for Philly International/Epic (CBS). \\"Shake Your Body\\" should've been presented in all of its 7 and more minutes of glory. It would've been nice if \\"That's What You Get For Being Polite\\" was in there and if it was possible, the first few solo Epic recordings that didn't make it on 1979's \\"Off the Wall\\".  <br /> <br />Speaking of, \\"Working Day & Night\\" and \\"I Can't Help It\\" could've been nice additions. As for \\"Thriller\\", I'm nuts about the \\"P.Y.T.\\" demo (written by Jackson and Greg Phillinganes - his right-hand man for much of the late-'70s and throughout the '80s) and its Stevie Wonder-like mood. But I'm mad that \\"Human Nature\\" was left off! And I consider that to be the best joint on \\"Thriller\\" besides \\"Billie Jean\\". The unedited version of \\"State of Shock\\" could've been nice also. And Michael probably has problems with Paul to have \\"Say, Say, Say\\" on the album.  <br /> <br />There were also moments from \\"Bad\\" that could've been added like \\"Liberian Girl\\" and \\"Another Part of Me\\". \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away\\" also would've been nice to add as was \\"Cheater\\" and possibly other songs during that era. His duet with Stevie - \\"Get It\\" - one of the biggest R&B hits of 1988 - could've also been added. The \\"Dangerous\\" cuts that didn't make it like \\"Serious Effect\\" and \\"For All Time\\" would've been great additions to that section.  <br /> <br />And in the last disc, I would've replaced \\"Childhood\\" (sorry I just don't like that song, Mike) with \\"Scream\\" (with my girl Janet) and also put in \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" (which is a great anthem of a song). And \\"One More Chance\\" could also be there to complete the MJ hit circle since only few can ever getaway with having hits between 1969 and 2004.  <br /> <br />BUT... other than that... I LOVE THE BOX SET! It definitely confirms what we've known since the eighties - Michael Joseph Jackson is a bad mother (SHUT YO MOUTH)! Who's bad?
B000002HH9|3.0|Let me begin by saying I am NOT a perennial fan of The Cure.  If I were a fanatic, as I am about U2, then this review would be rubbish, since bias lends one to an agenda.  This synopsis will only do you good if you appreciate the same sounds as me:  Tori Amos, Depeche Mode, Simple Minds, Crowded House and similar mood-inducers.  While DISINTEGRATION is monumental if for nothing other than \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Pictures of You,\\" WILD MOOD SWINGS has it's moments, much like Prince's SIGN O'THE TIMES.  Others have already hinted to you that this album is easily acquired in the bargain bins.  And I believe track #13 \\"TREASURE\\" is worth $5 easily. EASILY.  Track #1 \\"WANT\\" builds from an already maddening riff to a gargantuan clang worthy of a candle-lit tabernacle (ergo -- I LOVE U2's \\"ZOOROPA.\\") Now it's valued in total at $7.  Though I find \\"13th\\" and \\"Strange Attraction\\" and \\"Mint Car\\" a 'common' cure, and great tunes in their own non-groundbreaking right, they would end up in your guilty pleasures, and not your disc changer for parties. If cash is burning a hole in your pocket, go ahead and purchase WILD MOOD SWINGS. If you're like me, it will collect dust, but a certain two aforementioned tracks will be even sweeter upon rediscovery.  Dang.  I think I'll put on track #13 \\"Treasure\\" right NOW.
B00005Y228|3.0|With Kylie's second album from the PWL/SAW era(1987-1991)  \\"Enjoy Yourself\\", this ranks as my second least favorite Kylie Minogue record.  This is ironic, because this was the record that I first heard of Miss Minogue's.  Like many Americans who aren't familiar with her musical backstock beyond the single \\"The Locomotion\\"; \\"Fever\\" was the record that caught the American music scene's attention in early 2002.<br /><br />I received the album as a gift on Christmas of 2002, & found myself sorely disappointed. Several months before I bought my first Kylie CD \\"Hits +\\"; a collection of singles & album tracks from her deConstruction era (1994-1998).  I was of course hooked & from there totally excited about learning more about Kylie's music. I should state that I did enjoy every single from \\"Fever\\" with the exception of the watered down \\"Come Into My World\\", but as a record \\"Fever\\" didn't hold up.<br /><br />This isn't the only artist I enjoy who has had a record define so much of their career.  Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation 1814\\" comes to mind.  It was Janet at the peak of her singles game, image, & concept. But as an album, it wasn't much to gawk at.  There would be better records beyond that one & the same holds true for Kylie.<br /><br />To be fair I don't care much for the Parlophone era (2000-2004) due the fact that it seemed Kylie just wanted to be a singles artist, after she worked so hard to become an album's artist.  I feel the persona of Kylie was carried over from deConstruction, but some of the music quality was left behind.<br /><br />The record itself starts off on a high-note.  The first three tracks lead you to believe that you are about to experience Euro-pop at its top form.  \\"More, More, More\\" screamed for a single release with it's thick, yet slick beat then you dive into the jovial effervescent pop workout of \\"Love At First Sight\\"; of course the haunting perculation of \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" follows.  From there the record falls into second-rate pop arrangments with an \\"In Your Eyes\\" or \\"Your Love\\" popping up here & there to save the record.<br /><br />Her sister Dannii would pick up the reigns for successful Euro-dance delivery (to me) with her fourth outing, 2003's \\"Neon Nights.\\" But Kylie didn't disappoint with her awesome follow-up \\"Body Language\\", which of course had a much more meatier substance & experimentive nature; with its electrofunk feel.<br /><br />As stated I just feel that this record was more about image & concept than the music. It had great videos, great fashion, stunning delivery, but overall failed to deliver on the musical level that the singles seem to promise.<br /><br />That being said Kylie completists & casual fans can have this record for two different reasons: 1. The completists (me) realize that she has other work & that that work is superb to this outing. 2. Casual fans/Top 40 fans who only like her singles & aren't that intesrested in her will love this outing.<br /><br />Though those who want to dig deeper (like I did) will not want to buy this first. You'd be better off purchasing a 'greatest hits' compilation (i.e.-\\"Ultimate Kylie\\" or \\"Hits+\\" or her first \\"Greatest Hits 87-97\\").Your Eyes\\" or \\"Your Love\\" popping up here & there to save the record.

0465043550|2.0|I was disappointed in\\"The (Mis)behavior of Markets\\" by the renowned mathematician  Benoit Mandelbrot.  His last two chapters are a must read by anyone interested or invested in financial markets. These final chapters explain ten of Dr. Mandelbrot's concise market observations. The first eleven chapters are a meandering memoir on Dr. Mandelbrot's market research, but would be a better read if condensed and less polemic. <br />The mathematical problem that Dr. Mandelbrot tackles can be likened to comparing the probability of getting a number on a six sided fair die, and a race with six horses.  Mathematical theory explains perfectly outcomes of throwing the fair die; theory does not illuminate the horse race, which depends on facts that are unknown and unknowable.  Empirically in races, the favorite has an extreme chance of winning while the long shot an unduly low possibility. Some field horses may have \\"normal probabilities\\" similar to a number on the die.  <br />As many great academic minds and Nobel laureates have found, Bachelier distributions can model financial markets' probabilities. Dr. Mandelbrot rightly states that the Bachelier theory does not always fit market reality; markets show erratic volatility.   <br />Dr. Mandelbrot misses opportunities to show his readers the points at which risk and reward are outside the Bachelier derived probabilities, dismissing prevalent theory in toto.  His fractal model of volatility replaces the Bachelier derived probabilities by a power function. Both models attempt estimates on the \\"normal market\\" (analogous to handicapping a \\"field\\" horse) and fail to describe market extremes (favorite/longshot odds). It is the abnormal market misbehavior that causes great gains or losses for investors.  <br />Illustrating this oversight, the cotton market at times moves to fresh high or low prices. At high cotton prices, the probability of the price reversing approaches one and the possible gains by being long cotton approaches zero.At some unknown point the price will reverse. At market lows, we observe the inverse. At market limits, Dr. Mandelbrot's model does not help readers identify market risk/reward probability. Hopefully, new researchers can use Dr. Mandelbrot's work to improve our understanding of market risk and reward.
0316666343|5.0|This book really made me cry.  It was captivating yet sweet and gently while being narrated in the little girls tone.  I've had friends that have children and couldn't continue on reading the book because it was very emotional for them.  This is a true must read.
B000063K2W|5.0|This movie is the funniest I have ever seen, I have watched it numerous times and keep hearing lines I missed in the last umpteen viewings.  The acting is superb (well, Norma Shearer might be just a bit over the top) but everyone else was awesome and perfectly cast.  What a special movie to own, I am so glad it became available on dvd since I had tried to purchase it some time ago when it was out of print.
B000001GAM|5.0|The alchemists of the Middle Ages and before supposedly sought for the ultimate, essential nature of all known things.  Their ideas were both mystical physicalizations of this or that religious theory, foreshadowing real chemistry and physics which have returned to close the circle as it were, reaching ever more symbolic understandings of subatomic reality and macrocosmic scale.  All of this strange background comes to mind when you listen to this performance of the unfinished Bruckner Ninth Symphony on offer here. <br /> <br />Carlo Maria Guilini has a deserved reputation as a conductor's conductor.  He started out as a violist, playing in the prewar Augusteo orchestra, only to be later captured and interned in a camp for the war's remainder.  Despite the harsh conditions, he devoted himself to studying music.  By the time musical institutions in Europe were reconvened after World War II, Giulini was already gifted and deep, catching Arturo Toscanini's attention in an Italian radio broadcast of a Haydn opera, of all things. <br /> <br />In this very big symphony, Giulini reveals that he is still a master of the deliberate tempo that still breathes and moves, alive and elegant in its almost unwavering stillness.  In other hands with less heart, these slow tempos would be deadly and labored.  In Giulini's hands, slow does not mean plodding.  Inspired, the Vienna Philharmonic lifts up on very great wings of sound, reminding me of that famous phrase about finding men who measure up to mountains.  No department of the orchestra is slipshod or slick in this recording. <br /> <br />The recording quality is very, very high for a regular 16-bit red book CD.  Given the high reach of this performance, it is only natural to wish we had it in high resolution sound, with multichannel depth and breadth.  But even in stereo this CD does the red book medium proud.  The inner workings of the orchestra, those mysterious changes of register which remind some listeners of organ registrations shifting and reverberating in great cathedralesque distances, are completely and transparently revealed.  When the full orchestra plays, you will hear weight and light, far beyond the regular abstractness of these dimensions of presence. <br /> <br />It's all too much, really.  Only the inattentive could play this recording as background music.  It achieves transformations which seem like the aural equivalents of Medieval alchemy, despite our notions that music is made up of themes and motives, key relationships, phrasing, and other such mundane elements.  Everything seems made of fiery, whether wispy and ethereal, or massive and spiking out like furious sunspots burning against the walls. <br /> <br />The only equal of these heights, but still a different performance, in my view, is Gunter Wand's Berlin Philharmonic version.  If you lean towards the intense and the mystical, no holds barred, then this CD must be our first choice in this symphony.  The Wand is profoundly spacious and humane, as if the Enlightenment Era were being embodied in sound.  Rabid Bruckner music fans will probably decide they simply must have both.  So, start buying and enjoying before Giulini and/or Wand disappear from the commercial catalogues.  Highly, highly recommended: FIVE STARS, five galaxies of stars.
B00023B1A8|3.0|I had great expectations from this DVD. The song selection was (and is) excellent, \\"Acoustic\\" is the guys' second name and there was no reason to doubt the audio quality of their exceptional vocal harmonies.  <br />Yet, the result is far from satisfactory considering the potential of such concert. Four major drwbacks: <br /> <br />1. It is not exactly 'acoustic'; Excluding a couple of songs Stills plays only electric guitar and though in some cases it does fit (Just a song before I go) in others (For what it worth) it's out of place <br />2. The vocal harmonies are lost in an annoying echo created probably by the acoustic structure of the concert hall and not the actual audio editing; still the result - when they get to high pitch - is annoying <br />3. There are some tedious pieces that go on and on and are very boring and don't develop; Mainly \\"Wooden ships\\" followed by \\"Judy blue eys\\", each almost 10 minutes of very poor arrangement. They could do much better - and shorter... <br />4. The song sequence is uneven: The opening (Deja Vu) is quite bad, but then it recovers and improves (mainly due to the density of Nash's pieces - see below) and is pretty even until it gets to \\"Wooden ships\\". The closing part is OK as well, but I assume most people will jog between songs <br /> <br />Still, there's one person who stands out and not only because he looks much better than his 2 fat and sweaty colleagues: Graham Nash's pieces are all good and above, especially when he's at the piano, and for those (like myself) who see him as the band's main musical figure - this does makes this DVD - despite the flwas - worth buying. <br /> <br />
B00005A1PR|5.0|Do I LOVE this cd? You damn right!! India Arie is what I would call, clear as a bell, perfection! Her voice is dynamic. You must listen straight through. Im simply speechless w/ her work. Get the cd, you'll know what I mean!
B0000029GA|5.0|THIS MIGHT BE IT! 36 Chambers is also so good but it would be too offensive to the elders. Nah, nah, scratch that, let's just get into my opinion of the damn thing. When I first heard this I thought it was pretty good, now it turns out I can't get enough of it now! This is probably the best rap album in my collection. Sure, anything might top it, it'll always have a warm welcome in my collection. I've enjoyed mr. Nasty Nas aka Nasir Jones aka Escobar aka Nastradamus's rhymes for a few years now but I was still into commercial rap only then lol. Well, turns out i'm into every type of rap out now. I wanted to check out the dude's debut when he was in his prime. Note for fans who enjoy Nastradamus & God's Son the most: This is alot different! It has old school and underground beats with Nas's voice sounding younger and lyricasm just about street life in general. You have to get it anyway. I don't care if you hate it, it will always be awsome in MY book! I haven't heard any other of albums yet but I bet NOTHING will top this classic, NOTHING like everybody says!<br /><br />Phew, let's start.<br /><br />1. The Genesis: An intro with The Firm & Nas talkin about how bullish is on the radio these days & they tune into an awsome station finally. (no rating)<br /><br />2. NY State of Mind: Classic. Probably the most well-known song on the album. (10/10)<br /><br />3. Life's A Bitch (featuring AZ): Best on album with the classic introduction verse from AZ & Nas's verse is awsome as well. Olu Dara, Nas's daddy plays a trumpet solo at the end! (10/10)<br /><br />4. The World Is Yours (featuring Pete Rock): Another hit, another one of the best on the cd too. First song I heard off the album when I played THUG. GREAT production from Pete Rock. (10/10)<br /><br />5. Halftime: The 1st song Nas ever recorded when he was 18 or 19. Nice loud horn after the hook. (9/10)<br /><br />6. Memory Lane (Sittin in Da Park): Awsome beat & chorus with Nas on fire again. Pretty touching. (10/10)<br /><br />7. One Love: Beautiful song. Deticated to homies about their rights & wrongs in jail. Q-Tip is a good producer! He's still a better rapper tho. (9.5/10)<br /><br />8. One Time 4 Your Mind: Pretty good but a pretty annoying chorus soemtimes. Probably the worst on the album. (8/10)<br /><br />9. Represent: I love the chorus when whoever shouts \\"REPRESENT! REPRESENT!\\" Nas is still awsome too. OK intro. (8.5/10)<br /><br />10. It Ain't Hard To Tell: Another classic, although a little repetiave.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|&quot;The Bourne Supremecy&quot; is one of those films that I love, and I think is an awesome picture in the most &quot;popcorny&quot; way possible. This film has all the action of a 007 flick with a (somewhat) realistic plotline. I believe that &quot;The Bourne Supremecy&quot; is one of the best of 2004. There are two unforgettable scenes, and both are very similar. I will not give away the film, but I am referring to the two times when Jason Bourne is on the phone with Pamela. Awesome. &quot;Supremecy&quot; is defineatly a sensational movie, and is at least worth a rent.
B000002IOY|5.0|Out of all the Overkill cds this one is simply the best.From start to finish this cd does not disappoint.Personally the track Elimination is the best tune on here but for true metal fans it doesnt get much better than this.
0452285186|1.0|Making light of the difficulties of life is one thing.... But to consider suicide a joke is just sick!!!! regardless if is that of a bunny or a person. Shame on you, really!!!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|The CD gets this title because almost every track is worth listening to except for the opening one, which isn't bad for an intro track.  What's the best CD I've listened to this year? Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, of course.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ok first off if your into heavy metal of course you will give this one or two stars for everyone else it will be around a four or five.They actually have unique lyrics that also go good toghether and make u feel like your in their situation.Like 5 of the songs are popular music videos and its listed as the 134th best selling item in music.Most of the sounds each have their own uniqueness and basically they own.They arent trying to be the best band in the world just a good one and they have suceeded.I would say faint figure.09  breaking the habit are a few of the best songs on it.I recommend the live in texas cd dvd set.If you arent in hardcore metal like most arent then u will love this otherwise go for slayer or something.
B0002858YS|1.0|Wow, are these some of the stupidest lyrics that I have ever heard.  Take away the vocals and all that is left are boring, bland, unimaginative songs.  Terrible songwriting.  There are so many better new rock bands out there that do it right - why does this crap get so much airplay? <br /> <br />I hear these guys a lot on radio stations that claim to be \\"modern rock\\".  If this is the future of rock music then I'm turning to rap.
B00005JKC3|4.0|There are only a few moments when the Hulk actually looks real, but it matters little. Unlike so many comic-book adaptations, Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" aims for - and brilliantly achieves - another kind of realism: the emotional kind. James Schamus (surely the most under-appreciated champion of quality American films) has penned a superb story which ensures this isn't just another disposable summer film doing the groundwork for a franchise. It's actually ABOUT something: fatherhood, and the legacy we leave our children. Embracing both the Oedipal subtext and the need for thrilling action, Ang Lee, with typical confidence and subtlety, has delivered a film which is both stunningly entertaining and more than a little moving. The trailers hyped the digital effects, but there's so much more here to be enjoyed. Indeed, the trailers gave away absolutely nothing of Act 3 which includes a climactic performance from Nick Nolte which is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Innovative cinematography and editing are intelligently applied and, as always, Danny Elfman's thrilling score is a perfect match. \\"Hulk\\" is a film that can and should be enjoyed again and again - it's subtle, intelligent and above all interesting. What a refreshing change for Hollywood. Teen boys disappointed their expectations weren't met should take a second look at this in twenty years' time - when they're fathers.
B000002OOY|4.0|Every review you read about this CD says it is the best music ever written, and that if you love the movie you'll love this album. Well I have a different view on the matter.  <br />The score to Jurassic Park is John Williams at his greatest, and very well might be the best and most memorable soundtrack ever composed. That's obvious. I absolutely love the music. <br /> <br />But the CD is a completely different situation. Besides the fact that the CD label has JP's signature T-Rex printed on it, it's just another movie soundtrack. The way most of the tracks are laid out makes almost no sense at all. For example, track 7 (\\"Welcome to Jurassic Park\\"), is actually the end credits, and track 16 is only the second half of the full credits. I still have yet to actually go through the CD and find out how the cues correspond to the track order.  <br /> <br />Despite these minor annoyances, I still give this CD 4 stars.
B00005JKHN|3.0|But I do give it more credit because of the beautiful backgrounds and classic animation.
B000002KXV|5.0|The 80's for me was mostly a blur. It was a time where nothing was all that memorable.  There was too much going on all the time. Too many job responsibilities, too many family responsibilities, too many community responsibilities --- and too many drugs flowing.  I needed them to dull myself against all that responsibility. But I did manage to come out of my stupor long enough to listen to some excellent music.  There was a lot of great music in the late 70's and early 80's,  before disco took hold and corrupted everything. Fagen was a visionary and this will be his greatest legacy.  It was futuristic, but retro, at once distancing itself from anything else on the market. <br /> <br />I was a big Steely Dan fan. So I jumped on the Donald Fagen wagon as soon as he showed up.  But instead of being trite and bland, this album set a trend, started a movement, and woke us all up in the best way possible.  It transcended the drugs, it penetrated the psyche and reached the inner layer of everyone who heard it.  It touched that private part of ourselves that was hidden from view.  It was an album of genius, but it didn't get the acclaim it deserved.  It came out the wrong year.  And the general public was more enamored with flash and smoke than actual talent. That was the drugs talking, not the real musicians.  We heard it and were all greatly impressed. <br /> <br />I have to get personal again.  The sax solo in \\"Maxine\\" . . . a stroke of genius. Masterful.  Powerful.  Sublime.  Ethereal.  Poignant.  Just listen to how masterfully the guy does it, how effortlessly he makes it seem.  But YOU try to duplicate it!!! He's probably laughing right now at the thought.  It's a perfect blend of runs, riffs and real life experience.  It equates to one of the best sax solos I have ever heard. <br /> <br />There are no bad songs in this CD.  I still put it on and hear all sorts of things that the drugs clouded.  And I'm that much more appreciative of the fact that I not only survivedthe 80's, but I am able to learn, listen and remember the excellent music of the day.   Not all the music of the 80's was disco -- this Donald Fagen offering is our constant reminder.  Get this CD and get a true view of the much maligned 80's.  This is it's true legacy!!!
B00004Y7SF|4.0|She does a great job on the traditonal songs. The highlight is definitely Oh Holy Night. It has a great gospel vibe at the end.
B0006399FS|5.0|OK, first i heard Vertigo being played on TV commercials for iPods etc... and i was impressed for that 10 seconds. I'm an on-and-off U2 fan, so i went out and got a copy of the CD. The first listen left me feeling unsure... it was OK.  Then i listened through it again a few days later, and it all sank in... it made more sense, and the lyrics started growing on me.  By the fifth time through, i was addicted, and ever since, it has been one of my very favorite CDs.  Every song is carefully put together and well-played.  Go buy this wonderful, full, complete, solid BOMB!
B00005JN2Z|3.0|The movie was very well done except for the ending.Of course the good guy wins and walks away with the girl. I think what would have put this movie in league with such films as \\"The Usual Suspects\\" is to have the cab driver kill the girl after they get off the train and collect the money so he could start his limo company(the bad guys already thought he was Vincent). I think that would have given insight into the fickle nature of humanity.
B00068IOWC|5.0|I bought this album expecting so much. I thought \\"wow, this is gonna be great!\\" I found myself listening to it once, and thinking \\"eh...they did ok\\". I did the same thing with Achtung Baby and ATYCLB...I was SADLY mistaken. To say it takes a couple of listens to LOVE this album, would be an understatement. This album...there are really no words to express what it's like to hear MUSIC and just be moved to tears because of the sheer beauty of it. This album IS perfection. I can't get enough of it! My favorites are \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"A Man and a Woman\\" \\"Yaweh\\" \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" and \\"Original of the Species\\". \\"Miracle Drug\\" has quickly become my favorite U2 song, I can't wait to see them perform it in person. It's funny, the real let-down of the album is actually \\"Vertigo\\", the song everyone likes hehe.  This is DEFINATELY the best album of U2's career and in my opinion, will end up being the top album of all time.
B000286RKW|5.0|The guy below me says that you see more picture with the Fullscreen format. Right? WRONG. When you go to the movie theaters, all the movies are shown in the widescreen format. OK. When you get widescreen, you see 25% more to the left and right of the screen in the 1.85 widescreen format and 50% more with the 2.35 widescreen format. When you watch a widescreen film, you are not as close to the characters as you are with the fullscreen format. The only reason the black bars are there is because you zoom out everytime the black bars get bigger. The camera moves less in a widescreen film than it does when it's compressed to the fullscreen format. And, they do not cut off the top and bottom portions in the widescreen format.
B00030590I|2.0|Well it was a great copy. Picture wise BUt.and I do mean but. There were no english subtitles. The movie I bought gave me a choice of Mandarin and A mandarin subtitle. I got to watch the fighting scenes without knowing what the hell was going on. That really sucks because i love Jet-Li
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I love this set especially the fact that they are great movies and the features are OVERWHELMING. But that's not the point. Some guy named \\"Musicalgenius \\"Jeremy\\"\\" is the biggest dumbass ever (nothing personal) he bought a The MAtrix DVD set and he thought they were tapes. And, he put the DVDs in his VHS player and he broke it! And, to make himself look even stupider, he wrote a review about what he did. They are not only flat discs, they are DVDs! They are far better than stupid VHS tapes in all people's opinions. Hey Musicalgenius, ever heard of a DVD player? GO BUY ONE FOR $50! (Oh, and I totally agree with J. Testa who also wrote a review about what he did.)
B0000VD04M|5.0|Get out your angorra sweaters! \\"Ed Wood\\" is finally out on DVD! <br /> <br />In what has to be one of the most uncannily cast movies, Tim Burton has struck just the right chord with \\"Ed Wood.\\" His biopic of the worst director who ever lived (not really: MST 3000 viewers know Coleman Francis is really the worst) captures the period of feel of the 1950s with Stefan Czapsky's moody and crisp cinematography and Howard Shore's excellent tongue-in-cheek score. <br /> <br />Actually, \\"Ed Wood\\" is the film that Ed Wood himself would have made if he were more talented. Basically, the story is a \\"making of\\" and \\"behind the scenes\\" movie that follows Wood's Z-movie Hollywood career, from \\"Glenn or Glenda?\\" to \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\\" Burton portrays Wood very sympathetically through Johnny Depp's earnest acting: His message is that Wood was an unrecognized genius. Well, sub-genius, at least. <br /> <br />What really grabs the viewer though, is that the characters in this movie are so perfectly cast, that the actors actually *become* their characters: Jeffrey Jones is an eerily creepy Criswell; Bill Murray shows us the Myra side of John \\"Bunny\\" Breckinridge; George Steele is rotund, hairy, bald and inarticulate as Tor Johnson; and, Lisa Marie has just that anorexic Lillian Munster quality as Vampira. <br /> <br />But, Martin Landau as the aging, dying, addicted Bela Lugosi steals the show. Not just the facial mannerisms, the accent, the bombastic acting, are right on, but so is the spirit. Landau literally pours every bit of himself into the role. It's one of the few times the Academy gave the Oscar to the right guy, and Landau deserved it not just for this sterling performance, but for decades of impeccable acting, from \\"North by Northwest,\\" to \\"Tucker\\" and \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Ed Wood\\" has just the right light touch for most of its subject matter, which makes it a bonafide popcorn flick. The scenes dealing with Lugosi's heroin addiction, though, show a darker side that -- fortunately -- doesn't wallow too far into total doom and gloom. Burton's portrayal of the friendship between Wood and Lugosi was very touching without being sappy. Upbeat Wood really believed that he could bring Lugosi out of depression and addiction. He literally was the last true friend Lugosi had on Earth. <br /> <br />The best part of this movie is that while it is the very embodiment of camp, it's a movie, through and through, never a film.  <br /> <br />Ed himself wouldn't have had it any other way.
B000002UC5|5.0|(the first post-Beatles Release, age 28) <br />(originaly released April 1970)  <br /> <br />(34 minutes and 25 seconds of loving goodness) <br /> <br />Now if you ask me, and lots of folks interested in post-Beatle music by former Beatles do, this here album is probably the single most important of the post-Beatle Beatle work in the first five years after the fab-breakup. I say that knowing that during those years Ringo was, without a doubt, the most successful at going solo if you judge by top 40 hits. However, this album would set \\"the cute one\\" on his path to even more glory and fame (and wealth) and give us a peak at what might have been if the Beatles had remained together. <br /> <br />This here album, believe it or not, didn't have any tunes released as singles. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" got a lot of radio airplay in subsequent years, but it weren't a single. I am amazed too, Paul. <br /> <br />This album is also of interest because it was released just a couple days after McCartney announced to the universe that he was departing the Beatles. Therefore, he had obviously been in the studio on his own doing his own thing even as the fabs were falling apart. It ain't much of a surprise I guess because now there is plenrty of documentation that things were pretty sour right there at the end. In fact, the Beatles' Let it Be came out after this one, so by this time it was pretty obvious to all of us that something was amiss. No matter, we all got some great mucis from the four members as solo musicians for years after the breakup.  <br /> <br />I give this here album a solid five thumbs up (five for the five Beatles... take your pick as to who the 5th might have been). This one is one of Mama's favorites and she likes to put this one on when she's in the kitchen fixin' up sopme grub for the Huckabee clan.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is actually a great movie to watch with your young teens. This C movie, C because it has a budget cheaper than a B movie, is almost a twisted version of \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" without the hominess of the 1950's nuclear family. The Dynamite family is a fractured group of relatives living in the wide-open spaces of Idaho surrounded by farms. The High School and community seem to be in a time warp since the \\"hip kids\\" in school actually look relatively like squares particularly the designated good looking guy antagonist who looks like he is sporting popular fashions from the mid 60's and he looks like Eddie Haskell (Leave it to Beaver) if Eddie had worked out (Son of Eddie?). Napoleon is handicapped by a family without parents that are never mentioned, he lives with his 32 year old unemployed computer nerd brother, his tough often absent grandmother, a sleazy visiting uncle who still wishes it was 1982 and he was a HS quarterback, all made worse by their poor economic situation. In addition, Napoleon has a tall-uncoordinated body, ill-fitting clothes, a bad haircut, an often-scrunched leer of a face and he possesses severely limited social skills. He is hopelessly antagonistic towards the in crowd, who he tries to combat by using over way over the top sarcasm. Although aware of his limitations, he naively strikes forward in attempts at dating and political school relationships. The movie is full of stilted dialogue that is sometimes painful (\\"you gonna eat your tots?)but fitting with the characters. The movie meshes surprisingly well with Napoleon and his friends Pedro, who runs for School President, and Deb, the nerd princess who pleasantly turn into an attractive young girl, surprisingly making headway although fighting extreme odds. Somehow this low budget flick got Hillary Duff's sister to play the antagonist sweet girl. A unique feature of the film is the periodic cameo like appearances of Pedro's cool and hip and slightly dangerous looking older cousins in a real \\"boss car\\" with great sounds. The cousins seemed to have transcended from our time into this Idaho time warp making their brief appearances startling but effective. On first take as an adult, you may reject this movie, but watching it with your kids you are more likely to pick up on this ultimate stark underdog movie that is extraordinarily unique.  Keep your expectations low, this isn't a Ron Howard production, and you will be surprised.eal \\"boss car\\" with great sounds.

B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather is a classic. Anyone who gives it a rating 3/lower has either NOT watched the movie properly and is judging it, or DOESNT knoe a good mafia/gangster movie (or a good movies in general) at all...The acting, the script, the scence, the cine., the ACTORS etc were all 5star rating...its not surprising that this movie was made 30+ yrs ago and is STILL being reconized as one of the greatest movies of all time. And i dont know about anyone else, but i have never seen so many oscar worthy performances or numerous classic actors and actresses all packed in ONE movie. Ever. If anyone judges this movie before they pick it up, i suggest to you watch it first and then crticize...you'll see there wont be much to criticize since this is the best movie ever...Mafia/Gangster #1 Movie<br />watch it and enjoy
B000007O9L|4.0|Mick Taylor was quoted as saying that when he first rehearsed with the Stones in 1969, he couldn't believe how bad they were - too loose, too loud, \\" like a garage band\\". Well \\"Stripped\\" just goes to show how far a garage band can improve with a few years' practice. This little outfit is ultra tight - Richards and Woods mesh to perfection and the strength of the Watts/Jones rhythm section must have left Bill Wyman crying into his chip fryer. Jagger's singing is more varied and expressive than in his stadium rock outings and the choice of material is more original than their usual live album stuff. Dead Flowers, Spider and the Fly, Let it Bleed and Slipping Away stand out however there isn't a duff song on the entire album. When it comes to live Stones, this is second only to \\"Get Yer Ya Yas Out\\". No shame in that - \\"YYs\\" is the best ever live album by anybody.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This two-disc album is part 2 of the definitive Best of the Beatles album, the first part being The Beatles 1962-1966<br /><br />The Beatles 1967-1970 is a fantastic tribute to beautiful music of this great pioneering band in rock and roll, which dominated the musical scene of the 1960's with one magnificent hit after another. Listening to the Beatles really has a feel-good quality about it. In fact all these songs are masterpieces in the history of music. My personal favorites are the melody Penny Lane, the uplifting With a Little Help from My Friends, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, the sad A Day in the Life, the uplifting All You Need is Love, Hey Jude, Revolution - one the best political commentaries ever put into a song, and a damming critique of mindless/soulless radicalism, the meandering While My Guitar Gently Weeps, the catchy OB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA, Don't Let ME Down, the fantastic Ballad of John and Yoko, Here Comes the Sun and Let It Be.<br />Music and the world would not have been the same without the Beatles. So get this slice of musical history now!
0679731725|5.0|When I was a kid, I read a children's author talking about writing, and he was up to the usual \\"it's not what you say but how you say it\\" thing that many people bring up when talking about great writing. What he said was the blunt truth - that in many of the world's greates novels, almost nothing happens. Reading this book made me remember this, as it exemplifies good writing as being about the presentation not just plot. And very little happens in terms of storyline. <br /> <br />The story is about an old British butler, at the twilight of his career. After having worked for a very distinguished lord who was disgraced after his death, the estate has been taken over by an American, who represents a newer, less formal, less butler-y world. The book is essentially the buttle-narrator reminiscing about his life while he takes a short road-trip for several reasons, one of which being to visit a woman who he used to work with when his original employer was still around. <br /> <br />The book lovingly mocks the classed and rigid stereotype of \\"proper\\" British society. This is the pre-WWII world that the narrator has lived in and reminisces about. However, during this trip he comes to realise that his life, employer, ethos, calling, professional sense of duty and outlook on life have not been completely fabulous - actually, they have left him a lonely old man who has missed many opportunities to be much happier than he currently is. Obviously, this has much to do with the woman he intends to visit in his trip. <br /> <br />The narration is what makes this such a great read (you can easily read it in a day) - Ishiguro really gets you inside the butler, thinking like him and appreciating and yet being infuriated at his sense of his own place as a butler and person. Unlike many other books which discuss the notion of sacrifice and professional duty and cultures where some are almost expected to give up on the personal, this one does it not in an angry way but in a subtle one,which will truly shake you to the bone if you can relate to the man who was (at least partially) blinded to truth and happiness by professional duty. This makes it an important book. But it's also funny and a great read all round!

B0006399FS|4.0|I'm a huge U2 fan and have listened to all of their albums. While this album may be \\"mixed\\" upon reviews left by U2 fans, it still stands with the best of them. I consider this album to be just as good as \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" if not better. Honestly, this album is U2's most complete album . . .even \\"The Joshua Tree\\" had filler, while this album has about 1 or 2 mediocore songs. Great album. Buy It, but not for Vertigo, because the album isn't \\"Vertigo,\\" and thank U2 for that because that is probably the worst song on the album . . .in my opinion.  <br /> <br />As for \\"Best Album of The Year\\" I wouldn't go that far. We have releases by Bjork, Wilco, Modest Mouse, etc. that would be fair to take that deem. Although this clearly isn't the best album of the year, it will win the Grammy for that nod, for sure. U2's \\"How to Dismantle. . .\\" is up against albums that provide no competition . . .unless you think that Usher's behemoth album, or Alicia Kets sophmore effort is better than this quality album provided by \\"The Greatest Band of All Time!\\" They'll win. <br /> <br />I do think that Bono is probably a chicken for not viocing his opinion on this ongoing \\"war\\" like he has done for previous American decisions. Bono is obviously scared for the record sales and bashing of the band, but honestly, when the female who took the biggest bash vioced her opinion, she stuck by it. She probably faced the worst part of her career during 2003-2004, but she shows bravery in heart and justice, regardless the consequiences. Just like U2, she survived the 80s, 90s, and is surviving the millenium, but unlike U2 she still has as much heart, even more, than she did when she first started. There is life after death, as she proves with having the number 1 tour in the world, beating Usher who was the biggest artist of the year. . . .We all know this woman as \\"MADONNA\\" and she is the \\"true survivor\\" with the will and heart of a lion. I think Bono should encompass some of that will and put it intohis band's next record, because that's the only think that's keeping this record from being their best . . .that's the only thing that keeps this record notches under \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"
B000065V41|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I saw The Muppet Christmas Carol. The very first caption read \\"I'm loving memory of Jim Henson\\" and I got a little teary-eyed. This movie is one big homage to Jim Henson while at the same time passing long the torch to his son Brian who directed the film.  <br /> <br />It was like getting to know old friends all over again. This is also where Gonzo gets more of the spotlight as the narrator Charles Dickens with his sidekick Rizzo the Rat (also getting a little more attention) It's a heartwarming take on an old classic. <br /> <br />My favorite scene is with the ghost of Christmas Present, with his warm friendly demeanor he gave you a nice warm happy feelings, even though you know the dreary future was yet to come. If you can listen to It Feels Like Christmas and not be moved you must be a Scrooge yourself. That song tells us exactly what Christmas is and what it should be all year long. <br /> <br />If you listen to every song you can see the love and memory of Jim Henson's work shining through with a message loud and clear. The ending is a grand scene with all of the Muppets singing and you've just gotta sigh. This movie is truly a Christmas classic.
B0002234LS|4.0|I'd seen that \\"Secret Window\\" had been panned in a number of places, so I went back and forth on whether to even bother.  Well, I'm glad I did watch it.  King is a student of horror, particularly the American Lit 101 type.  And in \\"Secret Window\\" you'll see King's \\"hat\\" tipped  to Poe, Bierce, Hawthorne, not to mention King himself ( \\"The Shining\\"). (And, from a movie-making point of view, don't forget Hitchcock!)  I think one reason that some have not latched onto this film is that it's primarily psychological horror - and one that deals with the double.  Popular expectations, when it comes to King, seems to run toward desire for the outward Boo.  Well, King can do that kind of horror, and do it well, but King himself has said, that (good) horror writers are ones concerned with the psychology of fear.  And as King has aged, and matured as a writer, it's the demons in the head that concern him most.  The movie itself is well acted, with Depp giving a solid performance as Mort Rainey, a quirky, very depressed, writer suffering from writer's block.  But the problems are much deeper on that front, and things simply are not as they appear.  Maria Bello as Rainey's estranged wife Amy, is excellent, nearly stealing the movie, and certainly deepening the tragedy, since her character, as acted, has depth, and is no cutout.  Tim Hutton is simply annoying as the other man, and you have to wonder just what Amy sees in him.  Then again, considering Mort's demons, any man would do.  Turtorro, as John Shooter, is a hoot in an over-the-top performance. What makes this forgivable and understandable is revealed by who really wears the hat.  Good flick.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Horrible! I don't know what's with this \\"synthetic music\\" but I fear that it may be carcinogenic.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|I must confess that, for me, the controversy and caustic criticism surrounding `The Matrix Trilogy', when coupled with the analysis these movies tend to inspire in the devoted, is generally more interesting to observe, as a phenomenon, than the actual films themselves.  Having already reviewed both sequels previously (check my profile), I'll confine this review to that of the box set itself.  <br /> <br />Disc One: The Matrix  <br /> <br />Released with very little fanfare or industry buzz in the `dead' season of early spring, 1999, `The Matrix' sprung seemingly out of nowhere and captivated millions with its heady blend of Gnostic metaphor, surreal sci-fi splendor, and uber-stylistic excess.  I have to admit, on first viewing, being less overwhelmed by the virtual-reality `twist' as I was impressed by the overall synthesis of Dickian mindwarp, cyberpunk, and Japanese anime (etc.) into one coherent package. Like a cinematic comic book, `The Matrix' was long on surface thrills and visceral impact, and brimmed with enough actual content to help stave off the inevitable \\"cool-backlash\\" endemic to all media trends.  In retrospect, the film has aged quite well, thanks in large part to the future/past conceptual design and the new digital transfer specific to this box-set release.  It's also the least of the three films, IMO, far too predictable in its dramatic arc and revolutionary rhetoric - hence, of course, its golden-sheen nostalgia-status for some in the wake of its unconventional sequels.  Still: entertaining, well-made eye candy. <br /> <br />Disc Two: The Matrix Revisited <br /> <br />This supplement disc documents the making of `The Matrix,' from initial script treatment to the final product.  Originally released with the first film as a dual-DVD package and as a stand-alone documentary.  <br /> <br />Disc Three: The Matrix Reloaded <br /> <br />The hype for this film was beyond belief.  The pre-release trailers featured greatest-hit montages of its many thrillseeker peaks, to some degree spoiling the visual virginity of the newly developed `virtual camera' technique; but the surface thrills of this film were/are secondary to the overall statement it made about the human condition.  Free from the studio-tether, the Wachoski Bros. returned to their original script and made two films far, far ahead of the mainstream audience's paradigm-threshold.  The backlash begun, thanks in large part to the tell-all denouement of the Architect.  Neo, so-called \\"one\\" simulation of revolutionary praxis, became no more than a link in a chain, a slave; and so in turn could be interpreted the audience itself, feasting on H-wood illusion and seeking enlightenment therein.  The sense of confusion and subsequent resentment was all-too-tangible in my theatre once the Architect opened his mouth and unleashed all those ten-dollar-words...alas, no feel-good counter-culture prozac here! <br /> <br />In retrospect, I probably like this film the best out of the three.  It poses the essential dilemmas of philosophy; heaps complication after complication like any good second act; and contains the most subliminal material of the trilogy.  The action sequences kick a$$, too. <br /> <br />Disc Four: The Matrix Reloaded Revisited <br /> <br />Contains documentaries focusing upon the freeway chase, teahouse scene, Burly Brawl and the Merovingian's lair.  Also includes the 23 cut-scenes filmed for the god-awful `Enter the Matrix' video game. <br /> <br />Disc Five: The Matrix Revolutions <br /> <br />The meme was out on this film long before its actual release, and the subsequent bleating of disgruntled critics - professional and amateur, print and internet - was truly a sight to behold: voluminous ignorance rabidly expressed!  Promptly proclaimed to be one of the worst sci-fi films ever made, the innumerable complaints tended to more portray limitations of the consumers rather than that of the creators - most amusing/pathetic of all being those who, obviouslynot \\"getting\\" it, claimed there was nothing to \\"get!\\" I will say this: anyone that demands passively receiving easy answers to the spiritual and humanistic quandaries posed by the W. Bros., without doing any in-depth research or critical analysis of the clues that are given, is going to have a very rough time of it. (Side-note: the critical commentary on the films is the epitome of this type of pretentious dismissal, served with increasing doses of stomach-churning pomposity).  As for myself, I was astounded and disappointed by this widespread laziness, but extremely satisfied with the movie itself.  `The Matrix Revolutions' is an epic finale, and easily the best of the three in terms of sheer brain-candy extravagance. <br /> <br />Disc Six: The Matrix Revolutions Revisited <br /> <br />Contains documentaries on the Club Hel, Super Burly Brawl and Siege sequences; profiles of cinematographer Bill Pope, the art-design team and 2nd unit crew, along with featurettes of the editing, sound and music. <br /> <br />Disc Seven: The Animatrix <br /> <br />Nine short anime films that give further insight to the backstory of the trilogy.  Personal favorites will vary from person to person (I like Beyond and Matriculated), but the unequivocal masterpiece of the set is `The Second Renaissance, Pt. One and Two.' <br /> <br />Disc Eight: Roots of the Matrix <br /> <br />Features two documentaries: `Return to the Source: Philosophy and the Matrix,' a cohesive-if-basic primer into the philosophers/philosophies that inspired the trilogy, and `The Hard Problem: The Science behind the Fiction,' in which modern scientists, writers and philosophers converse about the Matrix and its eventual probability in contemporary society.  <br /> <br />Disc Nine: The Burly Man Chronicles <br /> <br />A huge documentary about the preparations and principle photography of `Reloaded' and `Revolutions.'  Akin to `The Matrix Revisited' doc, in format and feel, although BMC is divided into three sections*without* scene selection - very annoying! - and interspersed with a whole host of `white rabbit' branch-off links detailing the various artisans, crew and actors that helped make these films possible. <br /> <br />Disc Ten: The Zion Archive <br /> <br />A collection of trailers for all three films, along with an edited sfx segment and a promotional puff-piece for the upcoming Matrix MMORPG (sorry Bros, I ain't buying it). <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />Packaging is quite nice - slipcases for the films and documentaries, a booklet describing the interior content (with a sardonic introduction by the Wachoski Bros.) and a boxcase resplendent in gleaming green code.  Essential for any Matrix fan - elitists and rigid ignoramuses need not apply. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

LUCKILY THE GIRL SINGS REAL GOOD SO YOU CAN'T HEAR THE INSTRUMENTS IN THE BACKGROUND MAKING NOISE.
B00007AJF9|5.0|Cate Blanchett, in her Oscar-nominated role, gives a splendid performance of \\"Elizabeth\\" in this sometimes strange dramatic rendering of Queen Elizabeth I's early days on the throne. The cinematography and costuming are excellent and Blanchett is simply stunningly beautiful. Her romance with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester is given a torrid rendering - in this version, at least, Elizabeth is anything but a \\"Virgin Queen\\" which may raise eyebrows, but it works on film. Also an intriguing look at what it must have been like to be a major world ruler at a time when women were reduced to subservient roles. To survive, Elizabeth transformed herself into an icon and changed the course of British history. Highly recommend. Dark and strange though!
B00008ADPF|1.0|Musically homogenous. Lyrically homogenous. Or just plain stupid. Nickelback isn't gritty; they're more like gruel. Need I say more? I won't because I am lazy and thinking about Nickelback is disrupting my peace of mind.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Wow these guys have gone soft. This album is basically a soft rock album , skip this one and listen to there old stuff.
0553212443|5.0|my class had to read this book for lit. class this year. although many thought this book boring and stupid, i loved it. i loved all the characters like fezziwig and scrooge. it amazed me when out teacher told us dickens never went to school. i think everyone should read this classic, because it changed my way of thinking and helped open many ideas to me. read this! itz not only a christmas story, but a story of repentance that should be enjoyed all year round.
B00000J2SQ|5.0|I really like this album. And I think you will like it to. The song Dead Ally Driver is very freakin' good. So, if I were you, I would buy it. There is only one boring song: 'Tite Squeeze'. But the rest is super good. My favorite songs on this album are: 'Dead Ally Driver', 'Bring on the Night', 'Power' and 'Rock Fever'. The rest is also very good, but these are the best. If you are a fan of Rainbow, then you must have it. Even if you aren't a Rainbow fan, you should still buy it. The prise you must pay for the album is low for such a great album. So buy this cd, and enjoy it. Listen it every day, and sing with the music. Highly recommended!
B000002LGW|4.0|Whether or not this is an unblemished live album is beside the point.  It was raucous enough to get a DM hater like myself to buy it (albeit many years later), and you can tell that the audience reception brings the band's performance up a few levels.  I always found early DM albums way too sterile--and ball-less; let's face it.  This album manages to get around that problem.<br /><br />\\"Master And Slave\\", \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\", and my favourite \\"Stripped\\" all rock the house (kind of an oxymoron when applied to a devout synth-band, but even so).
1401301363|2.0|I love Nigella. <br />I love her books. <br />I love her style, and her heart. <br />She writes like an angel. <br />She's brave and she's good. <br />Her recipes work! <br /> <br />Of course, I bought this book. And there is plenty that is good in it. But I think it's important to at least be able to say that there are some things which are not so good - specifically, the layout is gratingly difficult to follow, there are not enough pictures ... and there's a really noticeable amount of recycling from her other books. (She identifies each repeat - so my issue isn't with Nigella's integrity. It's just that I'd rather have a somewhat smaller book with all new material.) <br /> <br />If you're buying your first Nigella book or looking for one to give as a gift, I would recommend her classic \\"Baking & The Art Of Comfort Cooking,\\" - not \\"Feast.\\"
0446677450|3.0|3.5 stars <br /> <br />\\"Don't work for money, make money work for you\\" should be the basic mindset for those who want to stop working for other people and start living their lives on their own terms. In fact that's all I took away from this book - but I consider it pretty  valuable. <br /> <br />On a very basic level, there are two things you can own. THings that make/or can make you money (real estate, stocks, bonds, assets) and things that will drain you of money (high maintenance stuff like cars/boats, debt, interest you pay on debt etc.). Focus on getting things that grow you money, not drain it - that is the cornerstone of wealth. If you understand this already, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. <br /> <br />The idea is \\"common sense\\". HOWEVER, on that note, the book does drill it in very well, and because of that I DO highly recommend this for those who have no background at all in investing but want to take their first steps. I read this book when I was a freshman in college and it was an eye-opener for me in terms of how I thought about money. It gave me the perspective and for that I owe this book. For the regular joe, I think this is a great book to establish this mindset and it does it well with its plain (though obviously amateurish) writing syle.  <br /> <br />My warning: Kiyosaki is defintely a good salesman. THe success of this book is proof enough. The book also makes an effort to promote his other products such as his \\"educational finance board game\\", and not to mention himself and his speaking tours.  <br /> <br />However, if you can get past that plugging, you will realize that it is sound advice on the GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF BUILDING WEALTH (extra stress on \\"general\\"). There is also a good basic framework and mindset for real estate buying (buy real estate. Rent it out. Let Rent income pay for mortage. = \\"free\\" property). Obviously, real estate is much much much more complicated than that. You would have to look at taxes, appreciation rates etc. to truly picka good investment. I would look elsewhere for GOOD ADVICE on how to actually go through the process of buying real estate. But even so, the basic ideas offered by this book are a good start. <br /> <br />BOTTOMLINE: I would buy this for my son (if I had one) in highschool or college to read to get them started and inspired on saving and investing. But it will take far more books than this one, and also experience, and education to be succesful in investing. If you consider yourself money savvy, then by all means stay away from this book. Otherwise, the book serves its purpose: to inspire and give you a jump start.  <br /> <br />Better yet, I would recommend going to the bookstore (I guarantee you it will be there) and reading it off the shelf for those who aren't sure. It's a quick read and has some good ideas for the beginning investor at no cost to you.
B000003TA4|4.0|I really wasn't a big Nirvana fan in the early to mid-nineties. I thought there were much better 'alternative' bands than Nirvana. Nevertheless, Nirvanan was a breathe of fresh air on the radio. They helped usher out the hair metal bands that were polluting the radio airwaves. The silliness of the '80s were wearing out its welcome. Who would have thought that a virtually unknown Seattle band would unseat the (former) king of pop Michael Jackson on the Billboard #200 charts with an album chockful of nihilism, angst, and distorted guitar?<br /><br />As overrated as \\"Nevermind\\" is, I still think it was a pretty good rock album. The music was a definite contrast from the overindulgence of the hair metal scene . I definitely preferred the band's last studio album \\"In Utero\\" over \\"Nevermind\\" but \\"Nevermind\\" had its charms. I love the bassline for \\"Come As You Are\\". That is my personal favorite song off \\"Nevermind\\". I liked the melodies a lot more than \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was and is a good rock song but unfortunately it fell victim to radio overkill. Still I can't deny of the hookiness of the opening guitar riffs. My favorite non-single off the cd is \\"Territorial Pissings\\". I thought that song really represented Nirvana as a band than \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".<br /><br />As a whole \\"Nevermind\\" was a good rock album which I cannot deny.<br /><br />As good as \\"Nevermind\\" is, it definitely wasn't the masterpiece that a lot of people made it out to be. I thought that albums by L7, The Rollins Band, Fugazi, The Gits, 7 Year B***h, Social Distortion, and Babes in Toyland that came out around \\"Nevermind\\" represented the alternative counter-culture and punk music much better. Nevertheless, \\"Nevermind\\" did help change the landscape of the music scene even if for three short years.
6305696071|5.0|Pretty Woman was the first sleeper of 1990. (The second that year was \\"Ghost\\" which stomped a dozen bigger budgeted action movies in its wake that summer) To the executives of Disney affiliate Hollywood Pictures the movie was a low-budget throwaway film expected to quickly bomb. Released in February 1990, the film quickly caught on with audiences. To everyone's surprise that year, Pretty Woman made over $175 million dollars in ticket sales. Today the movie is a classic Romantic comedy.<br /><br />Julia Roberts gives a breakthrough performance in Pretty Woman. Her portrayal of Vivian the hooker with a heart got her an Oscar nomination. In J.F. Lawton and Gary Marshall's modern Cinderella story the working girl runs into Richard Gere's Prince charming Executive. He \\"hires\\" her to be an escort for a week for the \\"three thousand\\" dollars (the original title). During that week there's romance and hilarious comedy. The movie's too good to spoil; you'll have to buy it to see how it turns out. Other breakthrough performances include a pre Seinfeld Jason Alexander (he's at his best here), Laura San Giacamo (Just Shoot Me) and Hector Elizondo. This film helped establish these three stars careers.<br /><br />It pays not to take the story seriously; it's a fairy tale set in modern times. The film is not a misogynist statement glamorizing prostitution, just a movie plain and simple. Take it as that and leave it as that. Pretty Woman is a feel-good film that will put a smile on your face. I highly recommend this movie. And if you're buying the DVD I suggest you try to get the audio soundtrack too. There are a lot of great songs on that CD.
B00005JKGN|3.0|In such a segmental movie it's hard not to review it in segments, but we should look for a unifying theme nonetheless.  I was fortunate enough to see La Dolce Vita on the big screen recently.  However the screen size made me wonder: Was Rome really this ugly or did Fellini go out of his way to film in dumps?  The aerial shots of the Eternal City look like nothing more than the ghastly Soviet-era concrete slums that feature in pictures of Russian cities.     Fellini must have been feeling ironic when he titled this movie.  There's little sweet in the life of the main character Marcello Rubini or the beautiful people he hangs out with.  There's nothing solid in writer Rubini's life, no stable relationships, and even his job consists of annoying the jet-setters and pandering to the masses.  The movie starts with him unable to communicate with a bevy of suntanning women over the roar of the helicopter, and ends with him equally unable to communicate with a young, innocent girl over the crashing surf.  Despite all his dalliances Rubini is ultimately estranged from women.  He cannot even figure out his neurotic girlfriend, who is the only person in the movie who loves and cares for him.    Perhaps a key to understanding Rubini is his relationship with his father, who comes briefly to visit.  Rubini admits he never knew his dad who was gone all the time while he grew up.  There is a moment in the film, quite touching in a way, when the father decides suddenly to return home.  Rubino is anxious to have his father stay at least overnight, not just for his health (the dad was unwell after a night of carousing) but also because, I suspect, he wanted to better know his father and fill a void.  He can scarcely let go of the taxi that takes his father away from him, again.    Poor Rubini.  He falls in lust with Sylvia, the eye-popping screen goddess (how did Raquel Welch ever eclipse Anita Ekberg, who played Sylvia?) to no avail, thinks he loves Beautiful Person Maddalena who would be poison for him, can't get along with his girlfriend, and longs for a father that is not a distant stranger.    Fellini falls into an old cliche when he has Steiner, an intellectual and acquaintance of Rubini and apparent rock of good sense and stability, kill his adorable children and himself.  It's always the person you least suspect, and always done as an unconvincing plot device to take a turn or set up a new crisis.  Fellini apparently thought this bit of extravagance justified in order to send Rubini over the edge, or at least into the gutter of debauchery in the final party.  It's as if Rubini is to deny himself or be denied any sturdy human post he can lean on--father, lover, or friend.     I suppose any number of conclusions may be drawn from the movie, including that of there being no conclusion at all but the movie merely documenting postwar anomie and decadence in Italy.  Rubini appears in the end to become one of the society elite he's trailed for so long, whose motto could be \\"eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\\"  The picture stays with you and leaves you feeling a little hollow. It does have power.  It's well worth watching but I wouldn't think it a be-all, end-all great movie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I know; I know.  Han shoots first, Vader's helmet looks better when it's dusty and a bit lopsided, and there was never supposed to be an elephant in the cantina.  (Why does nobody ever mention the elephant in the cantina? Can it be they don't notice?!)    But this is unquestionably Star Wars, and it's all the Star Wars we're gonna get, so we might as well suck up and enjoy it.  And yeah, even with the minor audio glitches (THIS came from Skywalker Sound?!) and the little meddlesome touches (Where's the REAL Anakin?  Why does Boba Fett sound like a wuss?), it's still essentially the Star Wars we all know and love, now on DVD.  And don't forget, it's got improvements over even the Special Edition - on this release, for example, Han looks like he's REALLY stepping on Jabba's tail, instead of airbrushed in.  Oh, and watch for the stormtrooper hitting his head going into the Death Star control room.  Priceless!    Would I like it if George Lucas released the Not-Special Edition on DVD?  Oh, you betcha.  Even if I had to shell out five times the money, I'd still go for it (just to see the \\"force-field\\" effect under the landspeeder that they smudged in with vaseline).  But this set is amazing, and well worth it on its own merits.    We all liked the original Ewok song well enough, and I don't know anyone (well, except for G.L.) that thinks Greedo had a quicker trigger-finger than Han.  But it's still the best DVD set ever made.  'Nuff said.
0060512806|5.0|I felt compelled to write since I am only woman I know who has read this book.  My husband nagged me forever to read it, and around Thanksgiving I was looking for a long, meaty book.   Boy, this was it in spades! <br />  <br />First of all, I adored this book.  I found it brilliant and profound.  The people who see this book as only technically advanced have missed its real brilliance.  Some of the most vivid and touching characters in fiction live in the pages of this amazing book.  I could easily see this book made into a BBC series.  Actors would have a field day with Bobby Shaftoe, Lawrence Waterhouse, Amy Shaftoe and Goto Dengo, to name a few.  The way Amy and Randy come to trust each other had real resonance for me (see section on Love and Teeth!)  The  characters here breathe.  There is hacker social ineptitude, academic pomposity, real brilliance, not to mention Love and War over 50 years! <br /> <br />I love the way Neal Stephenson writes (I am reading \\"Quicksilver\\" now).  Say you view   reality as being one big cube and you can only see one face of the cube.  When you read Stephenson (for me, at least), it's like having the cube rotated so that you can see more of it.  Pretty potent stuff.   Also, I have a science background (you might have guessed) but Stephenson has this way of explaining things that is so basic that you can see outside box, too! <br /> <br />Finally, Stephenson has taken heat for his abrupt endings.  When I finished Cryptonomicon I found that all the ends did ties together when I mulled it over for a while.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|No doubt, the movie is astronomically funny and interesting. Napoleaon is an uncivilized, provincial, utterly-fool, overly-abused and socially-unappreciated individual. As the movie progressed, I started to hate those behaviors and personalities, and wanted badly for Napoleon to REVOLUTIONLIZE himself quite like the French leader Napoleon Bonaparte (if not, at least, quite like his brother.) In Part Two of this movie, if there will be, I expect to see Napoleon as an energetic and pragmatic individual with his hilarious drawing, dancing and time-machine experimentations.
0060005688|5.0|This is an excellent book.  The author makes some pretty earth shaking assertions, but being a scientist he supports them well with studies he either performed himself or by referring to the ones of other scientists.  The book is very easy and fun to read.  By reading it, you will learn much about yourself, your friends, society and business in general.<br /><br />The author's framework includes several dimensions.  The first one is that good feelings about good decisions weight much less on our psyche than negative ones associated with bad decisions.  Thus, people are more sensitive to losses than gains.  Let's say you bought a good soap and a bad shampoo.  You would think you could call it even; but apparently most of us can't.  We are a lot more bummed out about the bad shampoo than we are excited about the good soap.<br /><br />The second dimension is the number of choices.  The more choices we have, the more likely we are to make a poor choice, and the more aggravated we will get about that poor choice [because there were so many more superior alternatives].  Meanwhile, if we do make a good choice our satisfaction level will not increase as a result of having more choices.  The author indicates that good feelings satiate; meanwhile bad feelings escalate.  Thus, the number of choice compounds the power of the negative (but not the positive) feelings.<br /><br />The third dimension is the disaggregation of the population into two separate types of shoppers: the Maximizers and the Satisficers.  The Maximizers strive to always make the best choice for every single purchase they make.  As a result, they do a lot of research sometimes for the most trivial purchase.  They do research before and after a purchase.  Thus, they keep on benchmarking their purchases to all the other alternatives they had.  This mentality inevitably leads the Maximizers to eventually be dissatisfied with their purchases and question their own decision-making ability.  This leads them to doing more research, more comparison, leading to more purchase dissatisfaction.  It is a vicious cycle they may not be able to get out of.  As you can imagine, the Satisficers are just the opposite.  They are more casual about their purchasing.  They do a lot less research before making a purchase.  And, they certainly do none after making a purchase.  For them, most products are essentially equivalent commodities providing the same utility with no implication on their customer satisfaction.  Obviously, most of us are somewhat between these two extremes.  But, the author discloses an easy test whereby we can measure our tendencies towards being more like a Maximizer or a Satisficer.<br /><br />The fourth dimension is how the Maximizers and Satisficers handle life and how satisfied are they with it.  As you can imagine, Maximizers make better purchases than Satisficers.  Information and research do contribute to superior choices.  But, paradoxically the Maximizers enjoy their purchases much less than the Satisficers.  This has profound implications across many human endeavors as \\"purchase\\" is just a proxy for any serious decision we are faced with.  The author did some research on MBA students.  He found that the Maximizers got job offers that were nearly 20% higher than the Satisficers.  Yet, they were much less satisfied with these offers than the Satisficers.  Given the Maximizers tendency to continuously benchmark, they probably were also much more likely to change jobs more frequently than the Satisficers.  The author also indicated there is a high correlation between Maximizer and depression.<br /><br />Somehow, the author's work contradicts economic theory.  Economists state that the more competition you have the better; as consumers will have more choices at a lower price.  But, the author's work suggests there is a diminishing return associated with increasing choices that kicks in way sooner than economists think.  Do we really need 85 different toothpastes andsoaps?<br /><br />The author discloses many more contrarian insights that really get you thinking about who you are.  If you like this book, you will also like \\"The Cost of Living\\" he wrote in 1994, a prescient book on how most aspects of our modern day lives are increasingly affected by economics and commercial profitability considerations.  Another interesting book very similar to this one is \\"The Progress Paradox\\" by Gregg Easterbrook.toothpastes and soaps?      <br /> <br />The author discloses many more contrarian insights that really get you thinking about who you are.

B00004ZDVQ|5.0|If you're looking for \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\", look elsewhere. If you're looking for \\"Fingertips\\" and \\"My Cherie Amour\\", it's not here. The recent \\"\\"Definitive Collection\\" and \\"Song Review\\" cover more, and \\"At the Close of A Century\\" is the mother lode,covering 4 CDs worth of Stevie's material.  <br /> <br />This collection of songs represents Stevie's seemingly nonstop Grammy winning era (covering Music of My Mind to Hotter Than July), where every year, he'd be up for album and song of the year, pop and R&B, and with good reason.  <br /> <br />Because the songs Stevie picked for this collection were recorded within the 70s into the early 80s, it's one of the few compilations that a lot of people don't notice being from different albums and is timeless in its own right (unlike the more Motown-sounding earlier albums and drumbeat sounds on the 80s albums, although Characters, Jungle Fever and Conversation Peace are pretty good)  <br /> <br />Out of the \\"new\\" songs, \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\" is as big a hit as the other songs on here. The only faults people will find with it are songs like \\"As\\", \\"Too High\\", \\"Pasttime Paradise\\", \\"Love's In Need of Love\\", and \\"All In Love is Fair\\" not being on there. The songs are timeless for better or worse...  some of the more socially conscious songs are as relevant in 2004 as they were in 1975.  <br /> <br />The songs have been covered and sampled by just about everyone you can think of. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jeff Beck, Alicia Keys, Barbra Streisand, and even Lindsay Lohan and American Idol tried their hand at these songs. But Stevie not only wrote the songs, but played most of the instruments and did the arrangements. It'll be something that people 100 years will still be grooving and singing along to... Musiquarium should be put in a time capsule, and every music lover should put this on their \\"desert island disc\\" list.  <br /> <br />As I said, this is one that stands on its own from beginning to end, andyou won't feel like it's a waste whatsoever to get the CDs that the songs originally came from. Essential? Absolutely.
B00005JKTF|5.0|There are numerous movies about the soldier, Jewish, and American points of view on WWII, but there are hardly any describing the ordinary civilians' point of view, the civilians in Europe anyway, and what it was like for those whose lives and homes were invaded. It shows ordinary people doing extraordinary things, such as leaving the comfort of home, jumping out of planes, blowing things up, etc. In all the hubub of the Jewish plight and the brave soldiers, one tends to forget about the silent heroes, the resistance groups, those who hid complete strangers from the Nazis, and the French officers who fudged Nazi law to help their countrymen (which by the way, is not just a movie twist). On a sentimental note, it was excellent that she went back to France instead of getting back together with the pilot; the French guy was SOOOOOOO much cuter. The only disappointment I found was not knowing what happened to the father and the kids. (Sorry to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it.)Who cares if everything in the movies isn't perfect or by the book, movies are for entertainment, and this fulfilled its purpose with flying colors.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I recently bought The Shaun of the Dead DVD and I do believe it was the best purchase I made in 2004. I had seen the movie in theaters and fell in love with the characters and story line. After I left I knew that this was a movie that I had to own. This movie is called a Romantic, Zombie, Comedy, and it delivers just that. It was written and directed very well and the actors bring it all together with the chemistry between all of them. You feel that perhaps at one time in your life you could relate to atleast one of the characters. The DVD is full of Bonus material, and even that will entertain you. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would definitely give this Movie/DVD a 10. I am going to keep an eye out for any other projects that these group of actors are in. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody, because it has something for everybody.

B0002OERI0|4.0|In comparison to their older albums you'll find that this one is much more polished.  Does that make them sell outs?  No.  Every band or musical artist grows into their own sound and \\"American Idiot\\" really showcases the band's maturity. If you listen to this album and immediately discard it as mainstream junk, that's quite unfortunate.  Do not go into this album expecting it to sound like Dookie (1994) or Insomniac (1995)- appreciate it for what it is- Green Day of 2004.  Yes.  2004.  Unless you enjoy crucifying every underground punk band that \\"makes\\" it- give it a chance.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|...this is pretty pedestrian stuff.  Typical Michael Mann: extremely slick, emotionally empty, all style, little substance, lots of men acting like men, throwing their testosterone around; quick cuts, flashes of color, loud rock and roll, very 80s.  What attracted Cruise to this non-character is a mystery, as he doesn't even get to show off his chops much.  Foxx is pretty good, but again, it's a one-dimensional character, mostly just reacting to what's going on around him.  As for the plot itself, it calls for a mighty suspension of disbelief.  Keep saying to yourself \\"It's a movie, it's a movie\\" and you might not mind how much you're being manipulated (and being asked to swallow).
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun of the Dead is by far the best movie of the year and the DVD release has only made it better. <br /> The movie is about a bored and lazy londoner who gets dumped by his girlfriend on the eve of a massive zombie outbreak. With the help of his best friend Ed they set out to save Shaun's girlfriend Liz and survive the zombie epidemic.  <br /> The acting in this movie is amazing, Simon Pegg (Shaun) and Nick Frost (Ed) giving stunning performances with perfect comic timing, they play off each other extremely well and there isn't a moment in the movie that you don't believe these two are childhood pals.  <br /> This movie although a comedy still remains true to its zombie subplot with lots of gore and amazing visuals, I am a huge fan of zombie films and this one is by far my favorite. <br /> The DVD features the funniest outtakes (including a Beatles rendition of one of the movies funnier moments), fascinating breakdowns of the most memorable zombie gore special effects, hilarious interview with the band Coldplay and even bonus \\"Plot Holes\\" that explains the untold segments of the movie. <br /> Fans of George A Romero will definitely enjoy this funny and scary romantic/zombie/comedy.
B0002OOUP0|3.0|This CD is good i must say but you can't sum up all The Stones' songs into one CD with only 18 tracks. 40 Licks is much better beacause it has most of their greatest songs on it. I think who ever made this CD left out to many of their best songs.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|If you are having a new baby, the song Miracle is the most beautiful song you will ever hear. The entire CD is beautiful. Her voice, the music, the lyrics are captivating. Great gift for a mom to be.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|However it is obvious that hollywood thought it was against the DP, so they bloated the merit of the film to near orgasmic proportions.  It's above average but not a classic.  Sarandon was great.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|An excellent film! Cruise as you have never seen him before in a role he slips into with complete ease. Brilliantly directed - a film destined to become a classic of its genre! The film is hip & funky - a film brilliantly portraying LA as it is! A Stupendous portrayl of low life LA - not to be missed
B000067FP8|4.0|Gremlin movies are never very scary, but they are funny.  This movie is especially funny because the Gremlins take all these potions that change them.  There is the smart one, the gargoyle, the spider, and the lightning bolt.  Christopher Lee is in this movie as a crazy scientist.  He is funny in that role.  If you are looking to be scared, don't watch this movie.  If you are looking for a funny movie, try this one out.  Make sure to stick around for the ending in the bathroom.  :)
B00005JMUL|3.0|This is a lovely film to look at once you get past the creepy humanoid animation. The train is magnificent, but may have benefitted from my seeing it in the IMAX format. The artists obviously spent a long time getting the eyes right and are not at all reticent about showing off their work. The city at the North Pole can only be described as an example of benevolent fascism. I also worried probably too much, as this is just an animated movie, about OSHA guidelines up there at the North Pole. Finally, the movie is a lovely thing to look at and tells a sweet story about childlike faith, but there's a rub as well. Should I continue to support the Santa falsehood with my children? Isn't this movie more Santa propaganda, that we as adults know is false? Isn't it morally wrong to lie to our children, and to be complicit in propagating this lie? In the end, this movie supports the concept of discarding fact (the boy has collected evidence for the lack of a Santa early in the film) in favor of \\"belief\\". Hmmm. Perhaps it was intended to be a parable of our times, where faith and belief are regarded as virtues in and of themselves and the questioning of such is discouraged.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I HATE this movie! It is sooo terrible George Lucas ruined it with his casting jake lloyd, who couldn't convincingly say anything in this movie.  He can't act to save his life and Natalie Portman is pretty bad too. Jar Jar is stupid, the story is terrible, and the addition of \\"funny\\" lines terribly fall short.  This movie is so worthless I can't begin to scratch the surface of it's utter stupidity.  Trash these filthy new movies and watch the original trilogy.
B00005Y1UX|3.0|Great cast.  Imagine getting Robert Redford out of a semi-retirement to headline this predictable soaper.  Woody Harleson leaped from \\"Cheers\\" barstool to the big screen and was quite effective as the third wheel in what was a financial deal that went wrong emotionally.   <br /> <br />Demi Moore is stunning, but was she worth a million bucks for one night?  I don't think so.  This is a morality play and nothing more.  (Or should I say Moore?)  <br /> <br />Director Adian Lynne has crossed this area before, but not as interesting.  The cast is beautiful, the locations are exciting, the performances are top notch.  It's the story that only lasts 30 minutes, and the screenplay doesn't challenge the characters. <br /> <br />
B00005JLD4|5.0|I watched this movie tonight with my three girls.  It didn't matter to me if it is 100% factual.  It is based upon a true story, which could mean the directors or authors opinion of the actual facts. To me, all movies are skewed, sometimes the director has to take an angle when the actual events are gray.  I felt this was a GREAT MOVIE. My daughters are 11,9 and 5. The five year thought it was a little boring in spots, but the 9 and 11 cried through much of the ending. They loved it. This is a wonderful movie to open up for discussions on civil rights, slavery, racism or the strength of family.  One could argue if Camp Moore was not a bad place for these three girls.  It looked like it was a pretty clean and and safe place, but ultimately it wasn't home. I recommend this movie, not as a depiction of history, but as good movie. Also, the landscape of Australia and the photography throughout the movie was well shot.
B00005JMXX|3.0|\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is one of a few \\"propaganda\\" movies that has kept my attention through-out the movie. Aside from many technical blunders, the movie, as entertainment, was good. There is a scene showing a massive tidal wave hitting Liberty Island and New York. OK, I guess it could happen, maybe. But the Statue of Liberty certainly not be left standing. Neither would any of the buildings. All that aside, the movie does have entertainment value. As for the plot , and story line, the jury is still out. The premis that man has anything to do with climactic change, short of atomic disaster, is both arrogant and foolhardy. The possibilty of another ice age, it could happen. It has happened in the past, many times, AND WITH-OUT MAN'S INVOLVMENT.  <br />My recommendation is that you rent it first. I personally wouldn't pay $19 for it. I might pay $7 for it. <br /> <br />Note to film writers: <br /> PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do your research before making a movie. A wall of water such as depicted in this movie would have several thousand tons of pressure behind it. NO structure could survive it.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I never did see this in the movies.  I read some reviews on here and decided to go out and buy this movie.  I wasen't disapointed, this is one of the funnest movies i've seen this year.  Sort of reminded me of a friend of mine I went to school with lol.  I recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants a good laugh.
B0001YRVN4|4.0|The DVDs are digitally remastered and look very good, i have only one quibble--------- Hayden Christensen. One name that can enspire fear and pain in SW fans.  Why did Lucas replace the original Anakin with him?!?!?!!? I can't stand the sight of his ugly mug.  Also changing Boba Fett's voice to the Australian in Episode II is unappreciated.  I don't like the prequels and wish the originals could stay as loosely connected as possible.        Anyway, these DVDs are great all around.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Although the titles of many of her hits reflect that Shania Twain may be a woman who is inclined to spontaneous fits of shouting, her \\"Greatest Hits\\" chronicles in a counter-clockwise motion her commercial breakthrough with her swashbuckling 1995 sophomore album \\"The Woman In Me\\" through to her present-day status as country pop's premiere feminist phenom.<br /><br /> Slinkily beginning with the biggest hit from 2002's multi-platinum, \\"Up!,\\" \\"Forever and For Always\\" glistens as brightly as ever. The ideal sappy mainstream ballad has just enough punch to protect it from elevator muzak status, despite the fact that adult contemporary has played it to the point of excruciating superfluity. Its overexposure, however, has allowed radio programmers another option besides her mega-hits \\"You're Still the One\\" and \\"From This Moment On,\\" from 1997's earth-shaking \\"Come On Over, recently certified 20x platinum between both its pop and country versions stateside. Initially having started out as little songs-that-could, both tunes can now be recited nearly verbatim by the majority of the population with even a slight knowledge of pop culture.<br /><br /> Of course, the backbone of Twain's fame has been her in-your-face uptempo tracks with their strong themes of feel-good female empowerment. Who could ever forget the confident, sexy image of the singer/songwriter on her motorcycle in the video for the ever-catchy \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\\" video or the absolutely hilarious arena-ready rock of \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" complete with friendly jabs at Brad Pitt and rocket scientists. Did that song give you a good laugh? If so, you must check out the lesser-known hit \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\" which good-naturedly plays off a stereotype of male infidelity.<br /><br /> Although it misses out on including \\"It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing\\" and other excellent tracks from \\"Up!\\" which surfaced on public radar, three new recordings make up for the loss. The gratifying if not slightly silly \\"Party For Two\\" is featured in two versions, one featuring Mark McGrath and the other Billy Currington, the latter being the superior. A pleasing warm-bath ballad and a twangy upbeat number come with \\"Don't!\\" and \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" respectively. Both songs are leftovers from \\"Up!\\".<br /><br /> Despite the fact that fellow artist Steve Earle called her the \\"highest paid lap dancer in Nashville,\\" Shania Twain has confirmed herself a definitive household name with many memorable and classic hits synonymous with her name. \\"Greatest Hits\\" serves up every one of them and more.if not slightly silly \\"Party For Two\\" is featured in two versions, one featuring Mark McGrath and the other Billy Currington, the latter being the superior.

B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 brings a new sound that was missing from the pop music world.  Maroon 5 is mix of soft-rock, pop, and even in an understated sense R&B.  The feel of a Maroon 5 song such as 4th single \\"SUNDAY MORNING\\" has a soft-edge to it with the use of acoustic piano with almost a jazz-feel.  The Drums and the bass in this particular selection could easily pass as that of a hip-hop soul song. Essentially, Maroon 5 are a crossover group that give you the best of several facets of the pop music industry. With that said, a lot of things makes this album a 4 1/2 star - 5 star affair.<br /><br />Maroon 5 uses personal experience as the basis for SONGS ABOUT JANE.  Often, a singer sings BETTER if they are singing about something they can relate or has happened to them specifically rather than a simulated situation. You can tell that lead singer Adam Levine is singing from experience as well as his heart as he sings this compilation of love songs.  This album doesn't sound corny as some love related albums do these days.<br /><br />Song selection also elevates this CD to a \\"higher plane\\" so to speak than other contemporaries. This album is capable of spawning the majority of its tracks as successful singles.  Many contemporary albums can't do that.  Albums of the 1960s and 1970s and even a couple after those respective decades could have an album complete with singles.  Almost all of SONGS ABOUT JANE is enjoyable and you could sit and listen to its 46 minute length without growin weary.  With that said, my top picks are \\"HARDER TO BREATH\\", \\"THIS LOVE\\", \\"SHE WILL BE LOVED\\", \\"SUNDAY MORNING\\" (excellent in every way),\\"SECRET\\", and \\"THROUGH WITH YOU\\".  While those are my favorites, the whole album is screaming GRAMMY, GRAMMY,GRAMMY and deservingly.<br /><br />Production is solid on this album and the use of keyboard is something you don't see in man bands/groups these days.  The use of keyboards helps to perfect the \\"Maroon 5\\" sound that comes across on SONGS ABOUT JANE.  Imagine how \\"This Love\\" would sound without the neat organ riffs or how \\"SUNDAY MORNING\\" would sound without the perfect piano part?  Furthermore, Adam Levine is a great vocalist with a sort of mellow, yet soulful voice.  Emotionally, he could be compared to Mary J.Blige, because you can tell that he isn't just singing the song, but he is putting real effort and emotion into his songs, something many new emerging artists don't do.<br /><br />SONGS ABOUT JANE is an excellent album and deserves every bit of the recognition it has received and more.  I hope that it carries home Grammies at the upcoming 2005 Awards. 5 stars!magine how \\"This Love\\" would sound without the neat organ riffs or how \\"SUNDAY MORNING\\" would sound without the perfect piano part?

0471267554|1.0|After all the praise fans heap on Cordain, I was expecting a convincing scientific case for his ideas. Instead what he offers is a collection of anecdotes, fallacies and just-so claims.<br /><br />The opening proclamation is that the Paleo diet is the diet humans are designed to eat, because humans evolved on this diet. Thus an ad antiquitatem fallacy is the basis of the entire concept. His evidence for our alleged adaptation to the diet is changes in gut morphology, but a single fact cannot be the basis of a scientific theory. Cordain follows these fallacies by claiming that humans are not adapted to modern diets. That's fair enough, but doesn't support his own fantasy.<br /><br />The real null hypothesis to be refuted is not adaptation to modern diets, but adaptation to a natural high plant food based diet - the logical opposite of his claim. Of course, he never refutes the null hypothesis in any reasonable way, instead he makes biased remarks about problems on contemporary vegetarian diets.<br /><br />When concern turns to constipation on such a high meat diet, Cordain drags up some research that completely contradicts his diet. Firstly we have an anecdote about Vilhjalmur Stefansson an artic explorer whos party were cured of constipation eating the \\"Eskimo\\" diet. No surprise, because the diet is full of oils and fats that are excellent lubricants. However, Cordain wisely advises removing fat from modern meats, to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, with his version of the diet. Ironically his second piece of supporting evidence proves his concerns over constipation wrong. When Vilhjalmur Stefansson and a friend try the diet, supervised by doctors, they report gastric problems if they consumed an all meat diet without all the fat. It seems the Paleo dieter must choose between constipation or cardiovascular risk? Ironically the Innu peoples have a god they call Matshishkapeu (\\"fart man\\"), a god capable of delivering a deadly bout of constipation. How did the Innu peoples ever know of the existence of deadly constipation, and make it a centrepiece of their mythology? The existence of constipation on a high meat diet is proof that humans are not adpated to such a diet.<br /><br />Where is the evidence that the stone age diet is healthy? Again, it's not in this book. Contemporary stone age populations may not get cardiovascular disease or cancer like modern people, but they are far from healthy, with traditional remedies for common ailments from the cold to constipation. Worse, stone age peoples had terrible childhood mortality rates, and poor longevity by modern standards. Are we really to believe that bad diet has nothing to do with this? Cordain wants us to believe this, but he has once again no supporting science.<br /><br />Nothing in this book is anything like science, the claims are not even annotated with their respective references.<br /><br />If you want to feel good about eating a lot of meat, this is a must read. If you want a credible case for the stone age diet, you will be completely disappointed.of the existence of deadly constipation, and make it a centrepiece of their mythology?

B000063COX|4.0|This is where it all began for Iron Maiden. Granted, they did have a 3 song demo EP by the name of \\"The Soundhouse Tapes,\\" but both \\"Prowler\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\" from that lp made their way on to this one.<br /><br />This album was a bold move considering the music scene of the late 70's and early 80's. Disco was on its way out and New Wave and Punk was on its way in. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and The Who were by this time considered rock dinosaurs. To come out with a Heavy Metal album at this time was a bit of a risky proposition, but EMI liked what they heard and the band was signed for an album.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />While time has taken some of the edge off this album, this was pretty heavy stuff when it came out back in 1980. Granted, these songs are now 24+ years old, but they still retain the original intensity and raw power. You'll still hear the band play \\"Sanctuary,\\" \\"Iron Maiden,\\" and \\"Running Free.\\"<br /><br />The band's line up at this time was Paul Di'Anno on vocals, Steve Harris on bass, Dave Murry on guitar, Dennis Stratton on 2nd lead guitar, and Clive Burr on drums. Only Dave Murray and Steve Harris remain today. Di'Anno never followed up his Iron Maiden success, but is still an excellent vocalist. Dennis Stratton is currently touring with Praying Mantis. Clive Burr has since retired from the music business and is battling multiple sclerosis.<br /><br />If you want to see where it all began for Iron Maiden, this is the album to purchase. Keep in mind this is now almost 25 years old, so you're not going to get \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"Brave New World;\\" but what you will get is a young, hungry band from the early 80's who eventually clawed their way to the top of the heavy metal heap.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Wicked in NYC twice, once with the original cast, and once with the current cast, and both times I left the theatre in complete bliss.  Hearing Idina Menzel belt \\"Defying Gravity\\" has never ceased to bring tears to my eyes, especially hearing it live.  The songs are amazing and are truely addictive.  And unlike other peoples reviews about the lack of good songs, I find that they are very well written and soooo much fun to sing.  Not only should this CD be a must in everyones Broadway collection, but you should definetly try catching the show...you won't be disappointed!
B0002V7ODI|5.0|This movie is, in a word, perfect. Ron Perlman...well, I can't think of anyone better for the part and this gives him a chance to shine (which he does), whereas his other movies have not given him much of an opening. Another part that blew me away was Abe Sapien. Again, perfect casting in the form of David Hyde Pierce who brings quirk and emotion to the character. John Hurt as Professor BROOM is another character well done. And Selma Blair is another perfect choice as Liz, the female firestarter.<br /><br />There are so many things about this movie that stunned me but the other that I must touch upon is the visuals. The demon hound Sammael is excellently done and his battles with Hellboy are not only believable but they draw you into the action. Of course, Hellboy's sarcastic comments add much to the overall scheme of things.<br /><br />Rasputin, the 'mad monk'is another favourite (I always love movies involving interesting characters from history) but the villain who I can't put into words is Karl Kroenen. Forget Darth Maul, this guy has some skill with a nasty sword. And his face...well, I won't say anything else about his face except eeww.<br /><br />And let's not forget the DVD itself. I don't know if over-the-top is quite the right phrase but I mean; there's probably about 20 hours worth of extras there. Not that that's a bad thing but still...<br /><br />Not going to see this movie and, yes, buying the Director's Cut would probably be the biggest mistake of your life and that is, I think, the best way to sum up this movie!
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Michel Gondry's ingenious new movie is named after a line from the Alexander Pope poem Eloisa to Abelard. Abelard is a prominent 12th century philosopher who falls in love with Eloisa and is castrated by her relatives who find out they are in a relationship. After the tragic incident Eloisa retreats to a convent, Abelard to a monastery. The Pope poem is a letter from Eloisa to Abelard written during this time they were apart. Another reference was made to the same poem in the movie Being John Malkovich also written by the Charlie Kaufman. As puppeteer Craig Schwartz was staging a scene from Eloisa to Abelard he got badly beaten up by a parent who thought parts of it are \\"dirty\\". <br /> <br />In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Joel (Jim Carrey), decides to get the memories of his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased only to find out during the procedure that this is not exactly what he wants, that he is still in love with her. Realizing this, he tries to hold on to them, try to resist the procedure. We watch him struggle to keep the memory of Clementine alive in the same way Eloisa tries to hold on to memories of Abelard. <br /> <br />The complexity of the plot requires our attention. However, once we give this attention everything fits in perfectly. It is very coherent and logically consistent. I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers.
B000063DI8|2.0|Iron Maiden fans either love this album or hate it - there doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I'm in the camp that dislikes this album. To me it just seemed so uninspired and boring. I wasn't looking for synths or keyboards, but I was looking for more of the same quality songwriting that the previous seven albums had in spades.<br /><br />This album also marks the departure of Adrian Smith and the addition of Janick Gers. Janick's been in the music business for years and is a very good guitarist. He did great in Gillian, Gogmagog, White Spirit, and Bruce's first solo album, but in my opinion, he wasn't a good fit for a technical band like Iron Maiden.<br /><br />To me Adrian's co-written song \\"Hooks in You\\" is the one of the few bright spots on the album. The other good tracks are \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"No Prayer for the Dying.\\"  The rest to me just isn't good Iron Maiden. There's always going to be a snag here and there for every band. This one just happens to be Iron Maiden's snag.<br /><br />I find that when an album you haven't heard before is mercilously bashed, you tend to go into it expecting it to be some of the worst stuff you've ever heard. And then when you actually sit down and listen to it, you come away thinking it wasn't half bad. But in this case, it was 1990, and I was expecting another killer album from one of my favorite bands. Instead, I found it fell far short of my expectations. Even today, while I have the album in my collection, I don't go back to it often.
B000021Y77|5.0|This film is one of the best films I have seen, in many ways, you can't describe it, but it is fast-paced and you will not be bored. The German language in the movie actually adds to the movie, it would not be so good if it was in English. This movie is so innovative. 5 stars from me.

B00003CXUM|5.0|Mrs Chan as she is talking to her boss one day lifts up her head and says \\"if you give attention you can see things as well\\". In the Mood For Love calls for the very care she is referring to. As you pay close attention to the details it grows into a magnificent tale, the tale of an unlived affair. <br /> <br />Mrs Chan and Mr Chow infinitely postpone yielding to desire despite the strong magnetism pulling them together-maybe because they \\"do not want to be like them\\" or maybe because they want to be sure they are not doing this because they are angry with their spouses. <br /> <br />The rehearsal scenes where Kar-wai Wong plays a game of deception with viewer are ingenious. Before Mrs Chan is told by Mr Chow that \\"they were merely rehearsals\\" you are fooled into taking them for real. <br /> <br />With its poetic cinematography, gripping music and first rate actors In the Mood For Love is a praise to cinema, to the art of cinema...
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Let me say at the outset that if you like thrillers and don't mind formulaic movies then you'll like this. That said Hitchcock this ain't. Anyone familiar with the genre will have figured out the ending ten minutes in, right down to the telegraphed attempt at irony engendered by Vincents' complaint on the impersonal nature of LA. As to the boy meets girl, boy saves girl traditional thriller ending it's been done so many times that it takes a great plot to pull it off, and this movie doesn't have such a plot.  <br /> The cinematography is excellent and the soundtrack drives the action well. Cruise and Foxx are adept and earnest in their roles, and the dialogue works well enough, though it does break down at a few points; most notably during Foxxs' meeting with the \\"Vincents\\" drug lord employer. Cruise has thankfully learned the art of self control in acting and doesn't overplay his role as the assasin.  <br /> The major problems have been pointed out by most impartial reviewers, ie those not silly enough to propose this predicatable movie is worthy of Oscar consideration. The biggest problem is of course the unbelivability of the plot and the absurdity of the ending. (Deadly killer who when confronted with the \\"hero\\" suddenly loses the ability to hit the side of a barn.) <br /> All in all a common thriller with solid technical merits, but proving once again that a great movie must have more than good cinematography and sound. A truly superior movie must a decent,  or at least believable, story and that is what this movie lacks. Good for a night when you have nothing better to do, but not much else. <br />
B00005JNBQ|3.0|The main negative thing concerning this film was that it was absolutely 100 percent without a plot. It's basically just occurrences in the life of a guy named Napoleon Dynamite, who is pretty much an incredibly obvious nerd that is sort of his own person and doesn't care what others think of him. Commendable aspects of this movie were that it was outstandingly hilarious, in fact I think there are never any periods of three minutes or more in the movie that go without an amusing comment from Napoleon. One such amusing comment is when Napoleon is asked by a kid on his bus what he is going to do today and he replies \\"Whatever I feel like doing! Gosh!\\" when it is indeed not quite obvious what he is going to be doing. This movie is really rather pointless, but still I would give it three stars for its crack-you-up moments and its good acting.
B000000H42|5.0|MAKE NO MISTAKE,THIS IS A METAL MASTERPIECE.I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM NOW FOR 19 YEARS,AND IT IS STILL EVERY BIT AS FRESH AND EXCITING AS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.NOT A SINGLE WEAK TRACK ON THIS DISC.I WILL GO SO FAR AS SAYING THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME. <br />YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED......
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|First, the irony of someone accusing this band of ripping off Interpol, the rip-off kings, is so thick as to be kinda sad.  I hope that review is a joke.  The reviewer who compared them to M of B and Gang of 4 is right on the money.  If you're going to accuse FF of ripping anybody off, at least get the right bands, for pete's sake. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm too old, but who cares what sort of people listen to a certain band, honestly?  Calling them an art-house band is more a dig at their fans than at them, and anyone old enough to write an \\"adult\\" review should be beyond such stupidity.  But maybe I expect too much out of today's middle schoolers. <br /> <br />At any rate, this is a great rock and roll album. The addictive songs, blistering guitars and tongue-in-cheek (obviously too subtle for some) jabs at the club crowds and fash-homosexuality go beyond the Strokes or any of their clones.  There are a few weak spots, tho.  AA sounds a little too much like Pulp, and while I like Pulp, only Pulp really sounds good being Pulp, if that makes any sense at all.  There are a couple other weak spots but nothing that really ruins a song. <br /> <br />  FF has what it takes to build a great career and kick lots of butt, as long as they don't start reading their own reviews (except this one of course).  From the looks of it they seem to have their heads screwed on straight.  Thank God.  If I hear another emo or neo-grunge band I may take myself out!
B00028HBKC|3.0|This movie did a good job at showing what all Jesus went through. I just wish they developed his personality a little better. Couldnt really tell how he was or what he thought about. It was kinda too soft. but the movie still wasnt bad.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  Maybe I'm biased already because it's an indie film and I tend to respect no-name actors and low-budget movies... but this movie is honestly fabulous.  You'll go away from it with the best lines to recite at ANY event-- and it's a shame if people miss this.  There is no great \\"analysis\\" to go with the film... just watch it.  Laugh.  Laugh hard.  Laugh so hard you cry.  It's fabulous.  The deleted scenes are few, but worth it as well.  It's a gem of a movie.
B00009V7P8|1.0|Okay, let's get one thing straight here people, music is about havin' fun! That's why when someone at a music store put this on through the speakers I immediately wanted to rip off my ears in disgust at how downright miserable this CD is, it made me feel like my life had just fallen apart.  This Rice fella has no right to make us feel like the world is just a cesspool of sadness, what is goin' on in this man's head!?? I do like a bit of acoustic guitar music, but only when it was done tastefully, just try 'Unplugged' by Alice In Chains instead, stack up 'Brother' & 'Killer Is Me' compared to this turgid junk and you'll notice who's the REAL talent here!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|First off,I am a guy.I enjoy action movies etc...But this show has really drawn me into it's world! I originally just found it by boredly flipping through the channels, I then saw this amazingly beautiful woman who plays Lorelai Gilmore, mother of Rory Gilmore..so I decided to kick back and watch it for it's nice scenery and to kill some time...Was I surprised!! The acting was top notch, the witty banter between the characters did that much more to draw me into the show. I am now a regular viewer of \\"Gilmore Girls\\".<br /><br />IMO you can't go wrong with this show, the dialogue alone is enough to keep you watching.<br /><br />To sum the show up briefly, with this show you have intelligent dialogue, amazing chemistry between the characters and it is a good wholesome show for the entire family!<br /><br />This show gets 5 stars easily!
B0002IVN9W|1.0|This is a truely woeful album. Overblown, pretencious, uninventive and loved by Pitchfork. What a surprise.

0192833588|4.0|Sence and Sensibility has neither the clever mystery of Emma or the endearing heroine of Pride and Prejudice. But we all must learn to except that she couldn't top those two novels.<br /><br />That said Sence and sensibility is worth the read for any Austen fan.The Dashwood sisters various dilemas in love make a good story. We don't care for them as much as our beloved Elisabeth and Jane Bennet, but we wish them the very best all the same.<br /><br />Marianne's self-sensure near the end of the novel for the indulgence of her self-pitty and the lack of obsevance of common civility (in contrast to her sister)is not quite as satisfying as Emma's repentance.<br /><br />And sweet sensible Eleanor is just not as witty or charming as Elisabeth. Neither of the girls tempt us with Fanny Prices sweetness or modesty. And none of the love tangles are as interesting, mysterious or hard to figure out as in Emma.<br /><br />And the villians of the piece just don't match up to Mrs. Norris of Mansfield Park, Miss.Bingley of P+P irritates us more than Lucy Steele.Mr.Dashwoods fraternal neglect doesn't spark the indignation of the Bertrams insensitivity and self involvment.<br /><br />  We find more dissapointment in Henry Crawfords disgrace than in Willoughbys.It's a great novel in it's own right but just not Austen's finest work. Which considering how good a book it is, should be a great compliment to the author.
B00003CXDB|5.0|What can I say that hasn't all ready been said? This movie was great, it captured the greed involved in big business to the T! I have been in similar moral situations and have dealt with people who were seemingly cloned from Gordon Gecko, so I I am able to relate somewhat which makes the movie that much better watching it now..<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out...GREED IS GOOD.
B00005JN0T|2.0|The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.     The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.    (...) What is this thing next to the what, who did this and why?
B0002JP4L4|2.0|This movie absolutely sucks. Yeah, the soundtrack is alright, but other than that this movie bored me out of my mind.  If this is supposed to be 'dance' film, I fail to see how it's supposed to be one. There's hardly any dancing in it. The little bit of dancing that is shown isn't even anything spectacular. Toward the end of the movie when everyone is at the prom, these wanksters come out and try to breakdance. No real skills at all. Skip \\"Footloose\\" at all costs.  If you want to see some REAL breakdancing, see \\"Breakin'.\\"
B000000993|5.0|Don't listen to anyone who rated this album lower than 5 stars. This album is a masterpiece. If TooL never made the classic AEnimia, then this would be their best. The lyrics are great, the guitar is good, as well as the bass, the drumming is okay, and the vocals are exellent.<br /><br />Track ratings:<br /><br />1. Intolerance-(4:54)-10/10<br /><br />2. Prison Sex-(4:56)-10/10<br /><br />3. Sober-(5:06)-10/10<br /><br />4. Bottom (w/ Henry Rollins)-(7:13)-10/10<br /><br />5. Crawl Away-(5:29)-10/10<br /><br />6. Swamp Song-(5:31)-10/10<br /><br />7.

Buy this along with AEnimia for TooL's best albums.
B00009W0U4|1.0|A friend recommended this film to me. He is no longer a friend. This movie is so bad that I hardly know where to begin. At the start,or is it the end, of the movie the movement of the camera got me as near to air sick as I care to be with the constant moving around. I can only think that the dialog lost something in translation because it was just plain stupid. I have seen better acting in a play done by five year olds. The credits are impossible to read because they have reversed letters. My best advice is to avoid this movie at all cost.
0684830485|5.0|Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  One of the best war novels I've ever read.  Now I know why Hemingway is known as one of the greatest writers of all time.  I absolutely loved \\"The Old Man and Sea\\", but when \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" fell a little short, I had my doubts.  This was the one that finally clinched it in my mind that Hemingway deserves all of the accolades he's received over the years.  It's a love story that takes place up in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War which took place in the 1930's.  The main character Robert Jordan, is a young American dynamiter in the International Brigade.  Back in the State's Jordan used to be a college professor.  Jordan's grandfather used to be a great war hero, but since his father was labeled a coward, he has set out to try to redeem the family name.  It becomes his assignment to travel into the mountains of Spain, hook up with a band of guerillas, and to blow a pivotal bridge during an upcoming campaign.  Not being as familiar with the Spanish Civil War as I would like have been before reading this novel it was a little hard at first to try to figure out who was fighting and what side Jordan was on.  I then found out there are the Fascists vs. the Republic and Jordan is on the side of the Republic.  At first I thought that members of the Republic were Communists with the ideals they were preaching and since the Russians were advising them, but then when they said some disparaging things about Communists that made me think otherwise.  The guerilla band he joins up with is led by a man named Pablo who at one time used to be great leader, but recently has lost his nerve.  He no longer is as interested in the cause as he once was, and now would rather tend to his horses instead.  He once led this band on a successful assault on a train and everybody in the band still seems to consider this their crowning achievement.  Pablo is still very smart, but nobody now knows if he can continue to be trusted to lead them.  His female companion Pillar is really the one who has held the band together for the last few months of the war, but she lacks Pablo's cunning.  She says she has a little bit of gypsy in her and at times she tells people's fortunes, not all of them however are good.  She is very feisty and was probably something in her day when she used to date several matadors.  The rest of the band is made up of an old man named Anselmo who Jordan loves very much and is one of the few people he really can rely on.  Then there is a few younger men, a pair of competent brothers, plus a strong and loyal man named Agustin, as well as a gypsy who for the most part everybody considers useless.  Finally there is the young girl named Maria.  She was rescued from the fascists during the raid on the train.  She is the daughter of a former Mayor.  Her hair had all been cut off and she isn't as beautiful as she once was, but Jordan immediately falls in love with her the first time he lays eyes on her.  In war a few days can sometimes seem like a life time and the pair make the most of what time they have together.  Pillar had taken Maria under her wing and had been teaching her how to one day be a good wife.  She approves of Jordan and Maria's union and after the fighting is over she wants him to take Maria away from this place.  As the battle nears there are several scrimmages and some great fights.  El Sordo's last stand is very memorable.  Hemingway's descriptions are magnificent.  At times Hemingway switches back and forth between Spanish and English but it never seems to be a distraction as he always provides a translation.  There are things wrong with the Republic that eventually will lead to their downfall, but at this point in the war Hemingway shows them as just little inconsistencies.  For instance, the Republic doesn't seem to believe in religion, so it is ironic that all of the band still say their little prayers every time they are in the middle of a battle.  The people also want to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another.  If you are not from the same town as these people you will always be considered an outsider and an enemy.  There are too many fractions in the Republic.  They have some good ideals, but they are unable to really bring any of them to life.  Jordan figures even if they win they would probably need to get rid of most of the leaders since the majority of the ones remaining are all incompetent or murderers.  Both the Fascist and the Republic come off as being very brutal at times.  I wonder what Hemingway's political views really were.  I believe he probably had some of the same ideals that Jordan displays.  This book will make my list of the top 100 books of all time.ant to rule themselves rather than be ruled by the government, but they have no trust in one another.

B000060MWU|5.0|People tell me that they refuse to accept or even watch the work of David Lynch because his films are... psychedelic. My answer to those people is very simple. \\"The films of David Lynch are no more psychedelic than the dreams or nightmares you see each and every night you go to sleep\\". Dreams and Nightmares. Visions of the mind, that is, which we can not fully grasp but nevertheless visions we want to see over and over again in the search to find something more about who we really are. That's what Mulholland Drive is all about. Accept life and enjoy a real masterpiece of art. A dream/nightmare recorded on DVD. Thanks David, we owe you a lot!
B0002EXH4A|5.0|At first, I thought this album would be a dissapointment.  On the contrary, this album is good.  I like Dave's and Jeff's guitar work.  The drums are good but I think Gar and Nick are better.  Dave Jr.'s bass is good and provides a great fill-in.  I'm very satisfied with this album especially as a Megadeth fan.   <br /> <br />Enjoy
B0002858YS|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  Before I got this CD, I was always fond of the two songs \\"Mr. Brightside\\" + \\"Somebody Told Me\\", but I had no idea how good the other songs by the Killers really were. <br /> <br />I was excited when I got the Hot Fuss CD as an early Christmas present, but I expected that \\"Mr. Brightside\\" + \\"Somebody Told Me\\" would be the only good songs on the CD, while the rest were banal and sounded all the same. <br /> <br />How wrong was I?  The rest of the songs on the CD were nowhere near uniform.  Some songs began with some interesting techno songs, and another even had a bit of soul in it. <br /> <br />Here are my reviews of each song: <br />1. Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine // 8 - about a guy who kills his girlfriend, but really good nonetheless. <br />2. Mr. Brightside // 10 - best song on the album by far.  very catchy tune.  you gotta love it. <br />3. Smile Like You Mean It // 9 - a slower tempo than the others, but very good song  <br />4. Somebody Told Me // 10 - pretty much their debut song.  hilarious lyrics.  you can listen to this song nonstop, just like mr. brightside. <br />5. All These Things That I've Done // 10 - you can tell the songs different from just the beginning of it.  I love the middle of it, when they repeat \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier\\" as it builds up more momentum.  It makes you want to stand up and start clapping and singing with it.  I just love it how they incorporated some soul into it. <br />6. Andy, You're A Star // 9 - I love the beginning of this song.  it keeps the same rhythm throughout a lot of the song. <br />7. On Top // 8 - starts out w/ a bit of a techno beginning.  the song is really good overall, but the techno stuff starts to get on your nervs <br />8. Change Your Mind // 9 - not much to say, great beat overall. <br />9. Believe Me Natalie // 8 - about the 3rd song with a girl's name in the title.  nice tune, but you can't really listen to it over and over again. <br />10. Midnight Show // 10 - awesome song from the beginning.  great beat.  one of my favorites. <br />11. Everything Will Be Alright // 6 - an okay song.  not too crazy about it.  could be a better song to end the album. <br /> <br />I know I'm not a music expert, but I know what's good music, and the Killers is definitely a great band.  5-star album all the way.
B00005JNDX|4.0|I would say the first Bridget Jones movie surprised audiences with its loveable characters and humour. The sequel continues where the first movie left off with Bridget now together with her boyfriend Marc Darcy. Hugh Grant is of course back as Daniel Cleaver adding complications to Bridget's life. <br /> <br />Although this movie is probably not as good as the Bridget Jones Diary, it is still a great movie. Many funny situations like when Bridget finds herself in jail, trades her bra for some cigarettes and rehearses 'Like a Virgin' with the other inmates. <br /> <br />Renee Zellwegar with her British accent is great as this loveable character and fans will not be disappointed.
B000002NIW|5.0|deftones came into my life in 1997 with \\"MOS\\" from the rock show, with matt pinfield that mtv so helplessly pulled from the air-what else will they do with one hour every saturday night at 11?ever since buying the cd, i have been in love with each second, never ceasing to be amazed at what the deftones have created: <br /> <br />1. my own summer (shove it)-10/10-sheer genius.one of my favorite songs of all time.just heavy as all get out and chino screams his brains out.brilliant song.i can't say enough. <br /> <br />2. lhabia-9/10-a mellower, catchier chorus than \\"MOS\\", but still driving guitar riffs throughout and an amazing track <br /> <br />3. mascara-8/10-a soft and emo side of the deftones displaying the amazing vocal talents of chino moreno.good track,takes a while to get into but still good. <br /> <br />4. around the fur-10/10-the title track-back to the heaviness of the album.chorus blows up in your face after a seemingly mellow verse-interesting mellow breakdown in the middle of the song <br /> <br />5. rickets-8/10-not too bad, very repetitive verse that can get on your nerves but the chorus is just ridiculous.never really got into this song. <br /> <br />6. be quiet and drive (far away)-10/10-i never really understood the hype around this song; that is, until i lsitened to the whole song.amazing musicianship with chino's soothing vocals throughout.no wonder this song is an instant fan favorite. <br /> <br />7. lotion-10/10-crazy song.chino screams \\"i feel sickened!\\" like a million times and this is definitely a song full of strange guitar distortions.great cut.also a like 5 second bass solo which is cool as crap. <br /> <br />8. dai the flu-8/10-not too great until the middle where it really starts to become edgy and pick up the pace.then from there,it becomes a great track.skip to about 2:00. <br /> <br />9. headup-10/10-chaotic verses and a chorus which sounds like it features max cavalera chanting \\"soulfly, flyhigh\\".great stuff.my personal favorite after \\"MOS\\". <br /> <br />10. mx-10/10-its like a musical conversation between chino and a girl who chimes in after chino sings a line of the verse.the chours features his singing in an eerie watery effect.very diverse and eclectic. <br /> <br />overall, the deftones will never defy the magic of \\"around the fur\\".a must have for any fan of music. <br />
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This being the first time I have gone to CDNOW looking for a CD I was delighted to learn that they have a section at the bottom of the page for those of us to comment about what we have heard. I am open to all types of comments (you have to be if you are a spouse of someone in the military)and being that the CD I was debating on was Britney Spears Greatest Hits or Lindsey Lohan Speak I decided to let the listeners persuade me. Ouch you guys it's JUST A CD! There is something called artistic expression and although this is not Mozart her music (along with others) have swayed what people listen to now a days. I really enjoyed this CD and for once it's a singer that ... YOU CAN ACTUALLY SING TO! WHAT A CONCEPT! I think (and this is my opinion for those who love old rock and feel offended) that Britney gets better the older she gets. No offense but I don't see the problem in the way she lives her life (ex: smoking). None of us are high enough to judge anyone. Plus personally I don't think it takes great talent to SCREAM like your on fire into a microphone (ex: metal/hard rock). So bottom line if you are looking for some light music, fun, something to sing to please by all means buy this CD. It far surpasses the first one Britney put out (Baby hit me one more time).
B0000009SM|5.0|This is my all time Favorite Frank Zappa LP, ive only actually throuly lissend to 14 full LP's and out of his 60 some.. i dont know exactly what im missing, but this Album is just fanominal. Being an 18 year old boy, this takes me back, to way before i was born. It really does grow on you. <br /> <br />I love the opening song Incan Roads, how its just carried along into some smooth guitar, and its such comical lyrics. Very strange, great guitar. <br /> <br />Can't Afford No Shoes, just halarious lyrics, great sound one of my favorite songs on the is album, right up next to Po-Jama People, which is perfectly separeted by Cant affor no shoes by Sofa No.1 which is a good spacer song. <br /> <br />Favorite song is Andy, i just love the song.. the voice work.. its all just amazing... Wonderful CD... Frank Zappa And the Mothers,.. i love them so...  <br /> <br />Other Zappa CD's i really recomend are Apostrophy ('), and The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life, great live performace...
B000002BBY|3.0|Oasis is one of those bands that you either seemingly love or hate.  I'm stuck in the middle.  The music is good, but Gallagher's annoying whiny voice sounds like laryngitis and smokers cough combined, on a good day to boot!  Yes, his vox sounds honest and heartfelt, but so did Arnold Horshack's in 'Welcome Back Kotter'!!!  Moreover, listen to Track 10, 'Morning Glory'.  If one of the main riffs is not a blatant ripoff of REM's 'The One I Love', call me nuts.  Nuff said.
038073186X|4.0|First of all, let me warn you; several people who have written reviews for this book have spoiled the surprise ending in their reviews, an amazingly unpardonable act in my opinion.  Do not read the review by Robert Hazelwood if you intend to read this book and don't want the ending spoiled.<br /><br />Now, on to the book itself.  Shutter Island was as well-written as all the other Dennis Lehane books.  The premise is interesting; a pair of US Marshals are sent to an island which houses a facility for the criminally insane in order to track down one of the escaped prisoners during a hurricane.  The book has witty, well-drawn characters, a gloomy setting, and plenty of ingredients for a real hair-raising thriller.  There are several very creepy scenes and the whole feel of the book is bleak and moody, almost like a haunted house story.  The surprise ending was, I thought, well-done and made the book very unique compared to many other bestsellers.<br /><br />The book did, however, have its flaws.  There are some important people and events who are mentioned early in the book but are very quickly glossed over, then when they appear later on you have no idea who they are because Lehane fails to remind us.  The book also suffered from its pacing; it's a short book by today's standards, only 360 pages, and I felt that it should have either been far longer, with more detailed explanations and more creepy scenes which took advantage of the scary setting of the novel, or it should have been much shorter---this book could easily have been a novella, actually, running no more than about 100 pages.<br /><br />All in all, though, Shutter Island was an enjoyable book which will give you the shivers while you're reading it and haunt you for several days after you're finished.  This would be a perfect book for a plane trip or a day at the beach.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|I have no doubt that the creators of this film had a clear agenda behind making it ... to further propagate the notion of global warming and how America is behind the destruction of the atmosphere.  Once you get beyond that bit of junk science, however, the film itself is excellent.  Take it for what it is though ... fiction, pure and simple. <br /> <br />The special effects are outstanding, and the movie held my attention throughout. <br /> <br />It's definitely worth seeing; and I would even go so far as to say, it's definitely worth seeing again.
0783225482|5.0|While this can be viewed as a simple black comedy (and a brilliant one at that), it's message also shines and makes Death Becomes Her deserving of some sort of medal.<br /><br />The fairly simple plot begins with a broadway performance by \\"wrinkled, wrinkled little star\\" Madeline Ashton, performing a stage version of 'Sweet Bird of Youth'.  As people leave the theater in droves, Earnest Melville watches with wide open eyes at her sensational performance, as his fiance, Helen Sharp, watches with nervous eyes.  Melville and Sharp go to see Ashton after the show, and Ashton is out to impress.  Helen watches helplessly as Ashton overtly flirts wtih her man.  After the show, Sharp explains to Melville that Ashton has stolen men from her before, and that she just wanted to see if he could pass the \\"Madeline Ashton test\\".  He fails, soon marrying her and driving Helen into a life of misery and obesity in a small apartment full of cats.  As Helen tries to forget all about her past, Madeline drives her new husband, once a brilliant plastic surgeon, down to the pont where he is a despairing, depressed mortician.  When Ashton is insulted by her partner in an affair for being so much older than he is, she becomes horribly depressed, and desperate for some solution to the problem of old age.  She drives to the home of Lisle Van Rhuman, a temptress who is slmost symbolic of satan, who promises her eternal youth in a bottle.  From here, things begin going down hill, as Ashton, now undead, and Sharp fight over the man they no longer love.<br /><br />Isabella Rosalini plays Lisle brilliantly, strangely enough giving me the creeps more than just about any other villain.  Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn play the competing zombies perfectly, and Bruce Willis plays his part brilliantly.  If you're into dark comedy with a moral, this movie is great to pick up and watch anytime.
0142004235|5.0|I hadn't read John Steinbeck since high school but returned to him a year or so ago when our book group read his novel \\"The Winter of our Discontent.\\"  Following that, I read several other Steinbeck novels and recently had the good luck to read \\"East of Eden.\\"  It is admirable that Oprah Winfrey used this large, complex novel to present to her audience.<br /><br />Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden\\" in a burst of energy over several months in 1951.  He loved this book among all his works and, literally, put himself into it.  The first-person narrator of the story is, indeed, Steinbeck himself speaking in his own voice as a grandson of Samuel Hamilton, born in Ireland and a hero of this novel.<br /><br />Steinbeck said that he wrote \\"East of Eden\\" to tell \\"the story of my country and the story of me\\" to his two young sons in order to demonstrate \\"the greatest story of all -- the story of good and evil, of strength and weakness, of love and hate, of beauty and ugliness, how these doubles are inseparable.\\"  For all its melodrama, length, sometimes black-and-white characterizations, and preachiness, the novel achieves its goals.  I was transfixed by the book, couldn't put it down, and read it in a short time.<br /><br />The story includes the \\"doubles\\" to which Steinbeck refers as well as some others.  The book is the story of two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks.  It is the story of two Trask brothers, Adam and Charles, and of the two twin sons of Adam Trask and his wife Cathy -- Aron and Caleb.  Both Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb replicate in their own ways the Bible story of Cain and Abel.  Steinbeck gives this story a full, rabinnical exegisis as the reader sees the story of the conflict between good and evil play out in double over the course of the book.<br /><br />The Trask family and the Hamilton family are settlers in the Salinas Valley in Northern California.  \\"East of Eden\\" develops a finse sense of place, and when I finished bhe book I felt I knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself.  Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's granfather, figures prominently in this book for his wisdom, his stoicism, his inventiveness, and his other - worldliness.  His wife, Lisa, is also portrayed lovingly.<br /><br />Perhaps the most memorable character of the book is Cathy Trask who becomes \\"Kate\\" after she leaves Adam Trask and returns to the profession of prostitution in which she was engaged before her marriage.  Steinbeck calls her a \\"monster\\" and well he might.  The protrayal is striking and even nuanced at the end for all the starkness.<br /><br />Lee, a Chinese servant, is also well-portrayed for his fine mind, wisdom, tact, love of learning, and,  ultimately, devotion to the Trasks and understanding of himself.<br /><br />This is a sweeping, dramatically told story which captures the land, the good and evil of which people are capable, and the importance of what in the Cain and Abel story is described by the Hebrews word \\"Timshel\\" with which Steinbeck concludes his novel.  People have the capacity for both good and evil and the power for choice -- to understand the good and reject the evil.  The story is told in a humanistic rather than a theological way.<br /><br />\\"East of Eden\\" is a memorable work of American literature that, as a result in part of Oprah Winfrey and her edition of the book,  is receiving the attention it deserves.knew an area and its history that I have only in the most superficial manner seen myself.

1400032717|5.0|I am an eighteen year old autistic boy, so I was easily able to identify with the story's narrator.  We both had similar levels of autism (on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being \\"normal\\" and 10 being \\"rain man\\", I'd be about a 1 or 2, this kid would be about a 4 or 5).  We both have trouble 'chatting', (although when I get started talking...), we both love word and number games, we both have defense mechanisms (his are auditory, mine are visual), among other similarities.  Haddon's portrayl of the boy in this book is convincing, like it were written by an autistic 15 year old, with all the lines which, although funny, make sense from the autistic stand point.  I often laughed durring this book, although at all times the jokes weren't silly, but good observations by someone who knows the autistic mind.  Although the book starts as a 'simple' mystery novel, it rapidly changes into a book about family, as the boy tries to cope with his father, who tries to be sympathetic, but has a really hard time.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to understand more about the mind of an autistic, or who wants to read a great story of family love, or a mystery novel (which is what the first half or so of this book is), you should buy this book.  It is brilliantly written, not too long, and hard to put down.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I personally really liked this film when I saw it.  I still do and have it on dvd.  It's really a moving account of Christ's life.  really realistic of what he went through i'm sure.  It really makes you appreciate the love Jesus had to endure such a brutal cruxifiction and death on the cross for his creation.  It's really a moving film.  It's true it has a lot of blood and violence, but as it's a real interpatation of the cruxifiction I can understand that.  Besides to me one of the scariest parts and one I think they over did was showing the demon so often and dwelling on the negative instead of showing some of the more postive like angels and the ressurection at the end and Assumtion of Mary.  But overall I really liked it and think it changed a lot of people's lives for the better after seeing it. I know it did for my cousin.  I'd recommend it to any Christian you don't have to be Catholic to appreciate it.    I think it is one of the best movies about Christ.  I think everyone did a great job on this film, the actors and director and everyone involved.
B0000584V3|5.0|This album represents Opeth's huge amount of talent therefore a good album to begin with although every Opeth release is a piece of art.  <br />Mikael Akerfeld reaches the top of his incredible composing skills and creates interesting stirring music and a beautiful melodic vocal line that captures the listener's ear through the whole album. <br />The album combines epic acoustic riffs next to more aggressive heavy riffs along with clean soft vocals and death growls that only Opeth can work together in such beauty. <br />Blackwater Park is a breathtaking journey between darkness and light, a remarkable album that bursts with raw talent, that its harmony and strength can be appreciated not only by metal fans but by any music fan.
B00006690G|5.0|Wow.  I have listened to all kinds of rap and all of Eminem's cds, but NONE can even hold a candle to the brilliance of this one.  It opens your eyes to not only how talented of a rapper he is, but a songwriter as well.  The standout tracks on this cd are \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\", and \\"White America\\".  These songs are not only well written, but they show his different styles and abilities as a rapper.  If you like Eminem, or even if you you don't, and you haven't given this cd a chance, you're only cheating yourself.

B0000024ZI|5.0|No Question:  This is Mott The Hoople's greatest album.  Thank you, David Bowie, for producing and contributing \\"All The Young Dudes.\\"  The only weak track is soon-to-quit Organist Verden Allen's \\"Soft Ground.\\"  It's just a shame...but maybe, it's just part of the MTH mythology...that 3 albums (!) and a year later Mott The Hoople just sort of imploded.  But then, we wouldn't have had all the brilliant Ian Hunter-Mick Ronson collaborations, now, wouldn't we?
0345410025|5.0|After reading \\"The Memory Book\\", I can have a group of people give me random words, one at a time, and memorize them... in the order in which they were given.  Then, given a number, I can quickly recall the corresponding word.  Or, alternately, given a word I can recall the corresponding number.  It takes a few seconds for me to engrain each word, but I can easily do this with 20 words.  I'm confident I could recall over 95 out of a 100 if I ever had a reason to try.<br /><br />I have always considered my memory to be rather poor.  But after using the VERY SIMPLE techniques in this book, I am capable of memorizing things many people would deem near impossible, with minimal effort.  The first exercise listed ten words: Airplane, tree, envelope, earring, bucket, sing, basketball, salami, nose, and star.  Then provided a child-like way to not only remember all ten words but also in the sequence in which they were presented.  Some might, at first glance, think that's simple, but try it without a method!  I had them memorized in about fifteen minutes and now they seem to be permanently etched in my brain; that was over a week ago and I just wrote them in this review from memory!  The next exercise was a list of thirty words, most of which were complex and I had never seen before.  That might impress some people, but these methods have real practical applications.<br /><br />Memorizing names with faces, speeches, numbers (phone, credit card, a 50-digit number if you so desire) are what's taught in the first half alone.  The use of \\"pegging\\" is central to the memorization methods taught in this book.  Every number from 0 through 9 has a phonetic sound(s) associated with it.  By mastering the basics, one can quickly figure out how to memorize a list of 100 words/names if he really wants to.<br /><br />Here's an oversimplified example.  Memorize the following ten groupings by using a simple rhyming method:<br /><br />1. Bun<br />2. Shoe<br />3. Tree<br />4. Door<br />5. Hive<br />6. Sticks<br />7. Heaven<br />8. Gate<br />9. Vine<br />10. Pen<br /><br />Now think of a word you want to memorize.  This will be the first word in your memory.  Now peg this word to the word \\"bun\\".  For example, if you thought about a cloud, picture a hamburger bun with a big pile of \\"cloud\\" sitting in it instead of a hamburger patty.  The more outlandish the connection you imagine, the easier it will be to recall.  Peg your second word to \\"shoe\\" and so on.<br /><br />This is really awesome.  Why isn't this mandatory in elementary school?n    Now think of a word you want to memorize.  This will be the first word in your memory.  Now peg this word to the word \\"bun\\".  For example, if you thought about a cloud, picture a hamburger bun with a big pile of \\"cloud\\" sitting in it instead of a hamburger patty.

B00005QIPH|5.0|I admit that this is a cd you have to listen to a few times to 'Get into', but it is well worth it.  The Strokes are talented in producing music that many bands could only dream of.  Julian is confident and stylish on vocials and the rest of the band definitely holds up.  I think alot of the negative reviews come out of jeleousy that the group has the rewards that come with success.  They deserve it.  The tunes are short but catchy, I think this band will be around awile.

0800177177|4.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula is unlike most of Coppola's movies in that it doesn't really feel like a Coppola film.  Instead, it feels like a Scorcese movie - that is, Scorcese at his most self-conscious.  Coppola manages in this film to make an ancient subject matter vivacious and enjoyable by uniquely stylizing it, much as Scorcese did with Cape Fear. <br /> <br />It is because of this embellishing that the film ends up with a pseudo-orgy scene with half-naked women, which is not really in Bram Stoker's Dracula (that is, the book).   <br /> <br />The acting is all-around impeccable; as usual, Oldman steals the show - bringing something very fresh and new to the oft-seen Transylvanian archfiend.  The costumes, art direction and cinematography are also excellent, and - if you'll forgive the cliche - manage to evoke a world unlike any one you've probably seen before. <br /> <br />No, this film would more accurately be termed Coppola's Dracula. This movie is delightfully macabre, yet sinister and frightening - and very beautifully filmed.  Don't expect The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, or The Conversation, because this film is far from any of those other Coppola films.  But it is nevertheless extremely enjoyable. <br /> <br />As for the minus 1 star, this DVD is atrocious, and if Coppola would only do a commentary or two, make an appearance in a documentary, this would be at least 5 stars.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater's Images and Words is the album that made them famous and created a loyal fan base that continues to grow year by year. This is how good musicians sound like. Individually they are not the best players out there, but when they get together they are by far the best band right now. The band plays so tight and makes all this haunting, weird, difficult and beautiful passages that each time that I listen to them, I always go WOW.<br /><br />Petrucci's work has influence and continues to influence technically oriented guitar players all over the world.<br /><br />The song writing in this album is short of genius.<br /><br />Their sound is in the same level as Rush, Pink Floyd or U2.<br /><br />This album is just a true rock classic.<br /><br />If you're just getting into progressive rock this is a great introduction to the genre. Please buy this album and go see their shows, you will not regret it.
B000002B7O|5.0|Released 24 years ago, this recording has stood the test of time. Randy Rhoads gets as close to classical guitar playing in this recording as you can get in a metal album. Get the original album, the 1990 cd or 1995 remastered cd.
B00063EMJG|5.0|All i can say is i am listening to him now, this is a long, long play. This cd will take you back to the day when you first heard Mr. Young, wherever you were. Nice selection of his best cuts. Not only for old fogies like me, even my kid knows that he is the father of grunge. Remastered sound puts the vocals in the room with ya. Definitely worth it.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I'm glad a little movie like this is doing so well, and Hess is really good.  It's definitely funnier than most mainstream comedies -- particularly the scenes involving the Time Machine, the horse and the schoolbus, and the portraits on the wall in the living room -- but it chafes me and before you slam the non-helpful button, consider this: <br /> <br />1) The movie owes a lot to the spirit and style of Wes Anderson, right down to the precious opening credits, but it's not nearly as funny as \\"Bottle Rocket,\\" as unique as \\"Rushmore\\" or as moving as \\"Tenenbaums.\\"   <br /> <br />2) This is basically a quirky commercial stretched to 90 minutes. <br /> <br />3) Would anybody really like to spend time with Napoleon if they knew him in real life?  He's mean, unlikeable and his interests all seemed to be designed by writers into kitsch and irony. <br /> <br />4) Having most of the characters act like they're on serious meds or retarded doesn't make them endearing, it makes them seem self-conscious.  Seriously, what exactly is the intention of Pedro's constant \\"the sedatives just kicked in\\" demeanor?   <br /> <br />I didn't think it was that great, GOSH!!!
B00005JMYG|1.0|If for any other reason Anchorman proves that Will Farrell is stuck in the Character routine.  In almost all of his movies he plays either a hyper childish character, or a mindless sex addict esc character.<br /><br />Will Farrell plays Ron Burgundy, the #1 news anchor in the San Fransisco area during the 70's.  He has his posse of news men and together they rule.  However while holding an office party (at his place no less) he meets Veronica (Christina Applegate), a young woman who inspires to be a news anchor.  Ron falls in love with her but his over inflated ego (and stupidity) eventually gets him into trouble not only with her, but with the news station as well.  In the end though he makes a triumphant comeback and lands on a national network.<br /><br />For the most part this movie is dull, unfunny, and overall a mess.  The characters are cliched and the fact of the matter is that Will Farrell is starting to show signs of mediocracy.  He is always in one way or another the same character.  The only time I laughed during this entire mess was a gang fight between five different News stations (with the leaders played by Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, and Ben Stiller).  That scene was actually clever and funny, the rest of the movie garbage, avoid like the plauge.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is definitely a different film than most of what is playing in theaters these days.  There is no superstar magnet personality to anchor the film.  Special visual effects are nonexistent.  At first glance, a strong narrative is lacking.  So, why would anyone want to sit through this movie?   <br /> <br />The characters in this film appear to be two dimensional, but there is more going on here than your typical high school movie.  The characters, setting and plot are trapped on a banal merry-go-round.  Scenes often include boring neighborhoods, thrift stores, mundane high schools, and uninviting tracks of land.  There is nothing in the scenery that is really appealing.  The protagonist initially appears to a high functioning autistic, lacking in all but the most basic conversational skills.  He is surrounded by other family members who are lost on the trailing edge of internet chat room and various get rich quick pyramid schemes.  So what makes Napoleon Dynamite appealing?  Napoleon's adventure is just to make it through the next day - his world consists of the geek high school companions, thrift stores and family members who are poster children for dysfunction.  Watching him navigate his culturally meaningless world was fun.  This movie reminded me of \\"About Schmidt\\", another movie filmed against a backdrop of large and empty spaces with characters all too much like what many of us live with on a day to day basis
B00000G3PA|5.0|Sure its lacks the emotional heart of deep impact but when you look at the special affects and one liners and this film kicks ass, and at the end of the day its not ment to be thought provoking its good old entertainment.However that said some parts are equal to deep impact e.g when the shuttle independence goes down, i hate the whole idea of being sucked into space and also when Bruce says good by to his daughter it chokes me. Loved it at the cinema cant wait to buy this dvd
B000002KZA|5.0|It seem that very few listeners and reviewers pick up on the theme of this album.Construction Time Again was DMs political album with a distinctly left-wing socialist ideology. Besides that it was the first album recorded with Alan Wilder who apparently did most of the work and defined the much darker, industrial sound of this sadly long forgotten but still thoroughly relevant album. Wilder even wrote lyrics of his own for the grimly apocalyptic \\"the landscape is changing\\",a warning about environmental destruction and the terrifying but fascinating \\"two minute warning\\" about nuclear war.Initially I didn't like the song \\"pipeline\\" but have learned to appreciate it for its clever experimentalism-the groaning sounds in the background were made from a sampled pygmy chant electronically altered using their newly acquired Synclavier II sampler/synthesizer.A must have for Depeche Mode and Industrial fans!

0385508417|1.0|When I first started to read the book, a lot of my thinking was that this couple had the right idea. Christmas has become so commercial taking a lot of joy from the true meaning of the celebration.<br /><br />HOWEVER, when the selfish daughter announced.......did not ask.......she would be \\"home for Christmas\\" with the love of her life who she had known for one month I lost my sympathy for this stupid set of parents. To change all of their<br /><br />plans for the whim of a spoiled brat ruined the entire book for me.<br /><br />When are people going to learn to educate their children about manners? When are they going to let the kids know they are NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE TO TROD THE EARTH.<br /><br />So due to the stupidity of the parents, THEIR CHRISTMAS IN THE ISLANDS WAS<br /><br />RUINED and most likely the brat didn't marry her true love of one month. If I<br /><br />sound heartless, it is because too many people let their children run their lives<br /><br />and THIS IS WRONG!!!! Shame on you John Grisham.......you are better than this.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I must admit, I was extremely excited when I heard that Robert Wise had been given the green light to revisit this movie and \\"properly complete it\\" as envisioned in 1979. <br /> <br />For me, this was the first \\"new\\" Star Trek I had ever seen.  Up to that point, I'd only had exposure to the reruns of the Original Series, so getting to see this fantastic cast together again -- combined with what was then state of the art visual effects -- made for an event that equalled only the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie.  To be sure, the original cut of the movie was a bit lethargic, but even back then, the dazzeling special effects managed to pull the movie together pretty well.  Just seeing the redesigned USS Enterprise alone was worth the price of admission! <br /> <br />Now, all these years later, to see the movie in its \\"complete\\" form is a real treat.  All of the sound effects that were supposed to be in the original release are now there, and several special effects that did not make it into the film have been added -- including a few new shots of the Enterprise that you'll be hard pressed to pick out from the original cut.  The pacing is much better and far more dramatic, allowing both the cast and the effects to underscore what is perhaps the truest \\"Star Trek\\" adventure filmed to date. <br /> <br />At its core, Star Trek has always been about the positive philosophy of human discovery and this film serves that end like few others in the franchise.  The themes delved into here -- friendship, the quest for knowledge, emotionality, transcendance -- are the most basic to the series and are expressed beautifully.  Even without the extra special effects, though, this movie still looks fresh and holds up very well. <br /> <br />Aside from the movie, the bonus features are huge.  The audio commentary features Wise, Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra and the late Jerry Goldsmith, whose score for this movie is perhaps the best in the ten movie franchise.  Michael Okuda provides the unique text commentary which includes many insider items on the production.  Retrospective documentaries cover the little known Star Trek Phase II series that begat the movie, as well as the production history of the movie itself.  Many of the deleted scenes from an earlier VHS release are also included. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this movie has withstood the test of time and is well worth viewing again.  These days, it is like a good friend that you just don't seem to spend as much time with as you would like.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|\\"Team America - World Police\\" is a dangerous movie!  Within the first 20 minutes, I had to step out of the theatre and into the lobby to rest.  My head hurt from laughing, tears blurred my vision, and my runny nose nearly sufficated me.  I survived the rest of the movie but now I'm having flashbacks, laughing outloud at random times during the day.  Strangers move away from me.  Friends and colleagues are worried about me.  This movie is dangerous!<br /><br />To C. Shea (and other uptight reviewers here)... loosen up!  It's political satire.  Team America is not anti-Bush nor pro-Kerry.  It's anti-everybody.  If you would have watched it through and with an open mind, you would have seen liberals and conservatives bashed equally.  Political correctness was nowhere to be found and it's great!  We live in \\"America\\" where we should be able to laugh at ourselves outloud.  Although exaggerated, there's a lot of truth here.  Good or bad, the fact remains the USA is the \\"world police\\" these days and you're in denial if you think otherwise.  Sounds like you have a guilty conscious and/or extreme insecurity.  Being the American \\"patriot\\" that you are, you might want to work on your English language/writing skills.<br /><br />Anyway... I came on Amazon.com today in hopes that \\"Team America - World Police\\" would be out on video.  It's not available yet but I'll be waiting impatiently until it is.  I guess I should order an oxygen tank at the same time.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I enjoyed the first Jason Bourne movie \\"The Bourne Identity\\".  The sequel \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" continues on the same premise and follows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) five years later.  Someone is trying to assassinate him at his secluded beach area of India. Now he must find out who is trying to eliminate him. And find out why!<br /><br />Jason Bourne is still uncertain of who he is and where he came from. He is a government trained assassin and slowly regaining his memory. He must get answers from his boss and the top secret government program that put a hit on him. (Trenchmark) Jason Bourne is very intelligent and resourceful of his surroundings.  Corruption is rampant.  Who is going to clean up these loose ends?<br /><br />\\"Supremacy\\" is action packed and filmed with the viewer in mind. This movie is filmed with close up action and cameras everywhere. This movie is a pure suspense thriller that fulfills the bill. Joan Allen (Pamela Landy), Julia Styles (Nicky), Karl Urban (Kirill) and Franka Potente (Marie) are outstanding in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I found out that the Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, 2002) deliberately tries to get the viewer in each action scene. Handheld cameras where used a lot and Matt Damon did all of his stunts which makes this film entertaining.<br /><br /> I recommend purchasing this DVD because of the behind the scenes commentary.<br /><br />What I liked the most of the bonus features were the ten minute featurettes of each subject matter. Topics like action fight scenes, Go-mobile (car chases), Explosives and what is it like filming in each country. All of these subjects were commented on by director, actors and producers. Kudos to the producers for filming in the actual city and country of location: Germany, India, Russia, Italy and United States.<br /><br />Most bonus features on DVDs contain one long \\"Making of\\" feature. And you have to weed through some long commentary to find something of interest. Not on this DVD, that's why I recommend purchasing this DVD.on this DVD, that's why I recommend purchasing this DVD. <br />
B0002RNXNM|5.0|Quite simply the best album I have heard this year. I initially had mixed feelings about some of the tracks, but this was quickly quashed as my ear lent itself to the work as a whole. <br /> <br />There is something for everyone into the hybrid of electronica and rock that this album is. Some of the tracks are just impossible not to dance like about like an idiot to, while others (especially U Boat) are just chill out heaven (on par with Orbital). <br /> <br />One of my friends commented that the lead singer (Sergio Pizzorno) sometimes comes across like Sean Ryder at his best, I also think he shares some of the best of Brandon Flowers of The Killers. <br /> <br />How refreshing!
B0000029GA|5.0|I don't know how many times I've listened to this album before I recently realized how good it is! I bought it when I was into commercial rap, and didn't like it too much. I started scratching the surface of the underground and got into Rakim and KRS-One, and listened to this again, no luck. I've gotten really deep into the underground and old-school obscurities and the other day I pop \\"Illmatic\\" in...OHHHHHH, now I see! I don't like to hear about guns, drugs, and bitches often, but Nas has such a way here with his description of life on the streets and trying to stay up and survive!  Nas has never had an exceptional flow, but on \\"Illmatic\\" he spits with such a hunger and so relentlessly that your head shall start spinning! The thing I kept overlooking is that this is really an album to sit back and chill too, not really one to dance to or bump in your car. The brevity actually is a blessing too. Most of us don't have the time to sit through an eighty minute cd, so it's a lot easier to absorb and be constantly enganged in a 39 minute cd.  The first real track is \\"New York State of Mind\\"(maybe my favorite of them all) and the momentum maintains as Nas keeps bringin' it and bringin' it! Seriously, every track just spills into the next so effortlessly. \\"The World Is Yours,\\" \\"One Love,\\" and \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell\\" all stand out, but the point is to listen to them all together. The weakest track I thought was \\"One Time For Your Mind,\\" but really there isn't a weak link on this cd.  I still do not consider this as the best Hiphop album of all time, and I never will, but now I see what all the hype is about. This ain't even one of my personal favorites, but it's one I will be listening to more often from now on. Compared to what Nas has done the rest of his inconsistent career, this album is gold! Like I said, don't buy this and expect to blast it at a party, take some free time, kick back and just try to absorb its content. Maybe you will eventually believe the hype, eventhough it is a tad overrated.
B000002UB3|5.0|Ever since I was a little child, I have heard this album.  It took me a long time to start listening to what my friends did.  Everything fell short of this album.  It still does.  Listening to this is like seeing starry night for the first time.  I liked every song the first time I heard it and I still do.  I liked starry night, i always will.  This album will never leave my mp3 player. Keep in mind that they were revolutionaries like van gogh.  Start at number seven and go all the way through.  From seven the songs don't have pauses inbetween them, first time that was done on an album.  I don't have a problem with rap or pop.  There is some gross misconception that you can't listen to brittney spears and the beatles at the same time.  I do, however, find it hard to believe that whoever comes through that experience will end up thinking spears is better.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|My friend's dad came home with this album one night and suprised the heck out of me cause i didn't figure him for the metal kind of guy. I had a litsen, and bought it the next day and plan on ordering the other albums. I've read in the reviews here that people say you shouldn't listen to this one first if you've never heard them, i disagree, i've probably listened to this thing 100 times in the past week, its incredible!! I can't recommend this album enough.  And if your looking for a reference, Night Wish is like Evanescence but more metal and the lead singers voice is more operatic.  Enjoy!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album brings the experimental techniques used by Wilco in Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and the vocal techniques and blending of instruments in the Walkmen album Bows and Arrows. My favourite track has to be Neighborhood#2 (Laika) because its a perfect combination of walkmen and WIlco. This seriously is a contender for album of 2004 along with the above titles. Well worth the money!
0679720200|5.0|He learns his mother has died.  He asks for two days off, not realizing that one of the days is Saturday.  Madame Mearsault had lived in a home for the elderly.  Mearsault's boss sounds him out on the idea of moving to Paris where he is thinking of establishing a branch office.      At the beach with friends the sun is burning in his face.  A man pulls out a knife and Mearsault shoots him four times.  His lawyer does not understand him.  He questions him about his feelings at the time of his mother's death.      His friend Marie will not be allowed to come to the prison because she is not his wife.  At night in prison Mearsault feels bugs crawling on his face.  In the beginning of the imprisonment his thoughts are still those of a free man.  The main problem is killing time.      Mearsault is interested in seeing his trial.  In French fashion three judges preside.  A witness reports he was surprised by Mearsault's calm the day of his mother's funeral.  A friend tells the court that Mearsault's presence at the beach was mere chance.  Mearsault says he did not intend to kill the victim.  He blurts out that it happened because of the sun.      Mearsault comes to accept his fate with general indifference.  Camus' smooth and shining style provides just the right balance to tell the story of serial failures of perception by the hero and others as he meets his fate of imprisonment.
B00008DDSC|2.0|Did I like anything about this movie?  Well, I liked how Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, towards the 2nd half of the movie, finally ditched those dorky clothes she wore for threads that made her look like the sexy, beautiful woman that she really was.  Other than that, though, it pretty much sucked.  And it was REALLY weird!!  A love story???!!!  YEAH, RIGHT!!  It was more like an exercise in weirdness!!  Why am I not surprised that James Spader is in this movie??? (And I thought his character on ABC's \\"Boston Legal\\" was weird!!!) For once, I'd like to see him playing somebody that's normal.  After watching this movie, I'll doubt you'll EVER want to watch it again.  I won't.
B000001ESP|5.0|If you don't at least respect Rush for their musician ship, then you dont exist. Rush has the greatest talent of any rock band in the world. Their lyrics are meaningful, their music flows perfectly, and they dont sing about violence or hatred or sex like some of the crap bands that I have heard over the years. I you are smart and not an ass, I can almost guarantee Rush is for you.
B00005JLK1|2.0|To start off, the movie had a pretty good beginning. I must say that the beginning is one of the more unique set-up scenes I've seen. However, despite the good beginning, the movie did not generally go well. Before we go into that, though, let me tell you the premise of the movie. A ship that has disappeared for 40+ years finally re-emerged. A man found it and wishes to hire a crew to help him salvage it. After some negotiating, they finally set off to see the ship. They discover things they don't like. You know, like every horror movie.    Now, the reason why the movie did not go well is because it ruins any great twist right off. One of the first things you'll noticed in this movie is this little girl. Now when the ship was met with disaster, she was shown as the only one who wasn't affected, but soon afterwards, it showed that it didn't matter anyway. That little girl could have been used an excellent twist, but the director decided not to for some reason. Aside from that, the way they revealed this ruined the horror factor too.    Lets face it, like many people have said for centuries now, it is the darkness (or unknown, if you will) that scares us. If we are shown what we're facing, we will no longer be afraid. It is the fact that we have to guess when our minds run wild and we scare ourselves. This is why movies like House On Haunted Hill (remake) and many others like it are so scary. It keeps us guessing. To make it better, HOHH only tease us with disturbing images. When the first ghost appears in the movie (and it is quite early in the movie, I assure you), it doesn't even look like the dead. It looks like one of those corny kind of ghosts you would see in movies years ago. You all know what I'm talking about, it's nothing more than the actor with make-up to make the skin look paler.    It was so laughable that I scoff. You see, that will be a continuous problem throughout the movie. What it seriously lack is subtlety. It lacks a plot that makes us wonder. It also lacks scary things. The kind of ghosts you'll see all throughout this movie are just the regular actors, except with paler skin. What kind of BS is that? Tie this in with the fact that every creepy thing that happens is a direct action of ghosts makes the horror factor horribly low. In other horror movies, directors try to off-set this by making the door close coincidentally or through some other method. You know that there is a supernatural force behind it, but there is just enough to leave doubt in your head. This movie does not do that at all.    Another huge HUGE problem in this movie is the lack of connection you have with the characters, The closest thing you'll come to a come to a connection is with Jack, who clearly does not know anything about salvaging or being a sailor. He generally seems like a normal person, but he soon turns into the classical jerk bad guy we've all come to know. The problem is that he showed no indication of that kind of personality beforehand. Needless to say, his acting is not exactly top quality, but the script doesn't seem to be much better. Greer seems to show some kind of normal behavior, but the rest seems...how should I say this....stereotypical. Yes, that's the word, stereotypical.    One more massive problem is the plot holes. Now, almost every movie has plot holes, but how many has them glaring in your face? This movie certainly had a few. One of the biggest ones is when the crew start asking about research on the boat. Maybe I'm just ignorant, but how the hell do you find information about a boat that disappeared for decades? And no, I'm not thinking about basic information like passengers number, when it was created, or etc. I'm talking about details like possible leakages, how sturdy it is, and that kind of thing. How do you find information like that about a boat that has been missing for decades? Another plot hole is that Epps somehow seemed to have figure out one of the ghost's name without anyone telling her.Maybe I just missed it, but how did she do it?    And what's to top off all these problems? Some of the horror scenes actually made me laughed. I'm dead serious. During one of the scenes, I couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. This movie is just SO horribly cliche. I'm telling you all, it's almost like a ghost movie you would see in the 1980's. I was more scared by The Ghost And Mr. Chicken than this movie!    However, I must admittedly say that the movie does get incredibly cool near the end, especially when everything is revealed. It returns to its rather strange uniqueness again and you get this awesome scene that plays out almost like a ultra fast pace gangster movie. It's strange, yet it's really cool. However, this really cool scene ends on a bad note. It ends on a bad note because it reveals a plot twist that I had expected all along. Maybe you guys would not guess it, but unfortunately, I did. I gotta say, though, this plot twist eventually turned into one of the corniest twist of any modern horror movie I've seen. Once again, it's like something from the 1980's. The ending is slightly cool, but nothing really truly special.    Could the director honestly have thought he was making a horror movie or was this what he attended? Surely it must not have been former considering he put in Mudvayne's \\"Not Falling\\" in. Marilyn Manson's \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is scary, Mudvayne's \\"Not Falling\\" is not. However, some of you may consider it scary since it was the track played when we were introduced to the end, which implied a possible sequel. Really, this movie seemed like it would have been a better action movie. If you're looking for a scare, just ignore this movie.
0226264211|5.0|As the other book reviews here suggest, there are plenty of what on the television series The West Wing were called \\"Milton Friedman worshippers\\" out there.  For those who are not, it may be instructive that his ideological rival, Paul A. Samuelson, calls Friedman an \\"eminent scholar\\" and Capitalism and Freedom a \\"classic book...All thoughtful economists should study his arguments carefully\\" (Economics, 17th ed., pp. 41-42).  Enough said.<br /><br />If your intent is to read only one book by Milton Friedman, you should pick Free to Choose.  Arguably, Capitalism and Freedom is slightly more theoretical, while Free to Choose is more practical and more recent.  But the books don't duplicate in contents, and it's a most worthwhile use of time to read both: first Capitalism and Freedom and then Free to Choose.
B0001CNRSE|4.0|Someone wrote that this was a bad movie, said it was boring, corny, and not real. Well it aint supposed to be real, its supposed to be enternaining,and that it is. I enjoyed this movie enough to make me watch it twice.
0553212540|5.0|This is going to have to be one of the best books I read this whole year. I so would love to have this book be a movie.  It takes such interesting turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the whole era has always been pleasing to me.  What a fun read!
B000006045|5.0|Look no further. Buy this CD, then get back home, lock yourself in the basement and listen to this CD. This is one of the darkest CD's I own, it creates a very dark atmosphere where you'll be trapped till the album stops (so don't put it on repeat or you'll be trapped forever). No really, I personally think this is the best album made by Massive Attack, although 'Blue Lines' comes very close. It all starts with 'Angel' and is possibly the most dark song on the album, although that doesn't mean it's the best song on the album. The song start with a dark bass and with this really creepy sound, the vocals aren't very neccessairy in this song, escpecialy the sound is great. Then 'Risingson' - my favourite MA-song - starts off with this really cool, slightly creepy sound. This song is even hypnotical if you listen to it itenselly. 'Teardrop' has these haunting female vocals wich makes the song excellent. 'Inertia Creeps' is kind of strange, slightly erotic actually, not bad. A nice interlude follows then named 'Exchange', this is probably the only song on the album that isn't dark, but it's a great interlude. Dissolved Girl - The Matrix song - welcomes you to the second part of the album. This song had some pretty heavy guitars in it, nice song. Then the slighty depressing 'Man Next Door' follows, this is really an excellent song, and my favourite song on the 2nd part of the album. This song has excellent drums and a nice bass, and if 'Angel' isn't the darkest song on the album then this one is. You gotta love it! 'Black Milk'.. I really hated the song when I first heard it, but it grew on me with his very relaxing sound and now I just love it. It really calms you down, relaxes you, it's delicious. It also has this DJ set at the end of the song that reminds me of the 'Beastie Boys'. The title track 'Mezzanine' is worth his title, it perfectly represents the dark, mysterious world of Mezzanine, although you have to hear it a couple of time to like it. 'Group Four' is a perfect track to close the album (I moved the 2nd Exchange next to the 1st Exchange so that it sounds like theres only 1 Exchange). Let your dark side have some fun and buy this masterpiece, you won't regret it!
B0001MDP3G|4.0|The characters in this movie spend a great deal of time searching for food. And proclaiming that they are hungry. Which in some respects was indicative of the desperate times they lived in. It also involves some off-shoots of the digestive process, namely the defrocked preacher suffering acute constipation and a member of the traveling troubadours led by  Rene Zellweger's dad eating some less than digestible wild game and later summoning Ralph... There are alot of hungry people in this movie.    There are two concurrent levels of the story. One involves Jude Law trying to find his way back from the horrors of the Civil War to Nicole Kidman. The other is Nicole Kidman wondering if Law will make it back to her. In his travels, Law talks to those he encounters about his quest to return to Kidman.     One person Law talks to about this is an elderly woman living in a gypsy-style setting who temporarily takes him in. She is somewhat unique as she proclaims that everything she needs can be derived from a goat...interesting concept. In one scene, he talks at length about finding his way back home. She sits and listens and looks as if she might nod off. Eventually, she gives him something to sleep... or to end his discussion about going home before she nods off.    Throughout the movie, Kidman is harassed by the Home Guard, a motley collection of \\"stay-at homers\\" who travel the countryside looking for Confederate deserters and generally making a nuisance of themselves. A younger member of the Home Guard bears a striking resemblance to a young Edgar Winter. As an alternate ending, instead of the Winter look-a-like plugging our hero and dashing Kidman's hopes for a permanent reunion, he could have put down his guns and hooked up with Zellweger's dad's musical group and an earlier version of the classic instrumental \\"Frankenstein\\" might of been born a la southern style.    A couple of semi-noticeable gaffes in this film...In one, Law takes an early-appearing, copper plate likeness of Kidman to carry off to war with him and places it in an envelope with a self-stick adhesive flap similiar to what you get your dough back from at a bank drive-through window.     In another, Kidman's father, Donald Sutherland passes away and she opts to wear his large, oversize black coat in rememberance. As the movie progresses to the final scenes, the oversize, ill-fitting coat she is wearing is gradually and magically transformed into  a trim-sized, finely tailored, cut close at the waist wrap that looks right off the rack at Bloomingdale's.    In the final scene, everyone who has survived the war, hunger, tainted meat and the Home Guard or bothered to stick around until the end of the movie are outside sitting around a table...eating. Like I said, there are alot of hungry people in this movie...
B00006LI4S|2.0|I'm a big Gilmour fan - love his solo output... think Pink Floyd without Waters was just fine... think his vocals and guitar was what made classic Pink Floyd \\"classic\\"...    But, this DVD was sort of sad to watch.  The acoustic setting makes it all to easy to see that Gilmour has gone way past his prime.  He can no longer sing, and his guitar playing - without effects - is mediocre at best.    I was absoutely certain that I would love this DVD when I bought it, but by the 6th song or so I was ready to turn if off.  I don't understand all the 5-star reviews... search out some of the lower reviews and you'll see they echo(es) my sentiment.    BTW, for a better taste of Floyd from the 21st century, check out Roger Waters' \\"In the Flesh\\".  Even though I generally side with Gilmour in the Gilmour/Waters feuds, Water's DVD is infinitely more polished and entertaining than this one...

B000059H99|5.0|Rocky 1976 is my all time number one favorite movie. This movie is the reason why Sylvester Stallone has been one of my all time favorite actors, despite his bad films! Stallone invented the story and wrote the screenplay for Rocky, making him a Hollywood genius. <br /> <br />Everything about Rocky is outstanding. The directing, acting, and even the musical score by Bill Conti.  <br /> <br />It's a beautiful triumphant tale of a nobody who gets a shot at being a somebody. Our striving nobody, Rocky, is a club fighter who gets a lucky shot at the boxing championship title against the Muhammed Ali clone Apollo Creed, played by football player turned actor Carl Weathers. Then, there's another down on his luck character, Mickey, an old timer who never reached the big time and now can achieve his lifetime dream by training Rocky. This character Mickey, played by Burgess Meredith, is probably one of the most memorable personalities from Rocky. The movie's director, John G. Avildsen would later get inspirations from this secondary memorable character with Mr. Miyagi, and the movie as a whole with 1984's The Karate Kid. And behind the blood and guts of our main character is a wonderful and sensitive heart. The movie doesn't focus much on the fighting. In fact, the movie is all about Rocky's love to Adrian, played by Francis Ford Coppola's real life sister Talia Shire. And when Rocky goes the distance with the champion of the world in the most thrilling and astounding boxing scene in motion picture history, and loses due to the judges' votes, Rocky doesn't mind. He just stands there screaming out \\"Adrian!\\" to the reporters, and the whole world. <br /> <br />On top of the strong drama, is the engaging music of Bill Conti, including the classic training song Gonna Fly Now! <br /> <br />Rocky is definitely a movie for all ages and for all times. <br /> <br />By far, the greatest movie experience. <br /> <br />A+

The ticket price for the event was a toweing 2500 Chinese dollars, which was the equivalent of 250 US Dollars! The audience came out of the lecture largely disappointed. Most claimed it was a superficial event, in which Mr. Kiyosaki bragged about his own success as an author and povided almost no valuable insight into anything else.  <br />While we are enjoying the book Rich Dad, Poor dad. Mr. Kiyosaki is certainly enjoying his climb to the top with outrageously priced worthless lectures...The guy deserves a hand of applause
0800179501|5.0|The Karate Kid is a classic directed by John G. Avildsen (Rocky), and starring Ralph Macchio (The Outsiders, My Cousin Vinny) as Daniel, and Noriyuki Pat Morita (Happy Days TV series) as the memorable Mr. Miyagi. <br /> <br />The movie was released the same year Ghostbusters, Beverly Hills Cop and The Terminator became blockbusters, and it was one of the top films of that year. <br /> <br />The story is about a teen, Daniel La Russo, who has just moved in to California with his mother. We get to experience the struggles he has to go through while trying to adapt to the new home and school. Of course, things go bad for Daniel. He gets bullyed by a group of karate champs and he just so happens to be romancing the ex of the leader of this gang, Ali (with an I) played by Elizabeth Shue. After several beatings, he is finally rescued by the quiet and mysterious maintenence man, Mr Miyagi who ends up teaching him self defense in the most awkward but profound way. The movie focuses on the close friendship that bonds between Daniel and Mr Miyagi and how Daniel learns to balance his life amidst such rough situations. <br /> <br />The ending where Daniel goes the distance against the leader of his bullies, Johnny, played by William Zabka, who happens to be the 3 time champion of the All Valley under 18 Karate Tournament, and wins is quite breathtaking.  <br /> <br />Morita earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor that year for his mesmerizing performance as Mr Miyagi, but he lost. In my opinion, he deserved that award. It's also my opinion that The Karate Kid is one of the best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A
B00062IDCO|5.0|After a few seasons of letdowns, Voyager finished itself on a high. The finale, Endgame, is perhaps the greatest episode of the show's history and others such as Work Force really captured what Trek was all about. My only complaint would have to be the final scene...would have been nice to see Voyager getting home a bit earlier, but then again maybe it is best if we are left to use our imaginations. In any event, it was nice to see the REAL Borg Queen (Goddess Alice Krige) back in outstanding form!
B00005JMAH|1.0|Watching this movie was a disappointment. The earlier HP movies had their childish and irritating moments but were saved by their fun quirkiness, beautiful sets and scenery, and an entertaining story line that if not exactly plausible could at least be followed. And because I am a fan of Gary Oldman (who always plays punks, psychos and other oddballs with such style) I decided to check this one out. <br />First off, this movie really does have a lot of horror elements. Don't get me wrong, I love dark fantasy stories but after seeing the way this movie portrayed Hogwarts Academy there is no way I would consider sending MY child to such a school. They'd be dead within a week. Either from falling off a broom at 300 feet up or getting their faces smeared off by a pack of dementors or being crushed by a demonic Old Man Willow. Not to mention being scared to death by boggarts or mauled by werewolf professors. And this is supposed to be a kid's movie? <br />My most important gripe with the movie is it's disjointedness and infuriating contradictions and pointless scenes. <br />For instance - The Hippogriff must be beheaded for kicking a student (Malfoy) who provoked it, yet the head professor invites soul-sucking dementors to gather round Hogwarts to \\"protect\\" the children. Oh kids, don't mind the school train breaking down, it's just a Nazgul boarding the bus to check your tickets. <br />-Gentle Hagrid feeds the Hippogriff dead ferrets over and over again. We are even treated to a scene where we see a whole rack of them hanging like deer carcasses beside his hut.  Hey kids, this beast is very dangerous and has a beak the size of your head - would you like to ride him for today's lesson?  <br />-The Whomping willow (who I swear is a knockoff of Tolkien's Old Man Willow, just like Hogwarts is a takeoff of Le Guin's School for Wizards in her book A Wizard of Earthsea) likes to eat chirpy little bluebirds and tries to kill Potter and Hermione when they try to enter a passage at its base, but ignores them when they exit on the way out. <br />-The professors who had so much commanding dignity and personality in the previous movies are trivialized and protrayed as clueless and feeble. Other characters like Malfoy and his bullies and Potters aunt & uncle are portrayed as one-dimensionally stupid and sniveling. <br />The head mistress tells Harry she's sorry but he can't go to the village with the other students because his permission slip isn't signed by his legal guardians - and that's her final word on the matter. A meaningless and rather ironic exchange. So Potter must stay at Hogwarts where it's nice and safe and where he can be tutored by a werewolf to learn advanced and deadly magic. <br />Dumbledore walks thru a room full of sleeping students loudly telling secrets that the students must not know anything about. <br />The entire time travel episode is confusing and sketchy at best. <br />Not only that, the only thing worse than watching Potter almost die the last fifteen minutes of the film is getting to watch the whole confusing 15 minutes all over again as Hermione and Potter go back in time to meddle with the outcome again. <br />The first time is confusing, the second time its still confusing and repetitive as well. <br />There are a few consistencies however: <br />-Once again the new professor we are introduced to (Lupine) turns out to be the one mixed up with the bad stuff.   <br />-Once again everybody fawns over Harry Potter. Oh, Harry Potter, you're just like your father. Oh Harry Potter, you have your mother's eyes. Oh Harry Potter, you're such a special boy. Here's a special gift for you, Potter. <br />-The actors who play Potter and Hermione repeatedly remind us that they still can't act convincingly.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I bought the widescreen version of the Star Wars Trilogy the day it was released. FINALLY! My favorite movie of all time on DVD! So what if George Lucas altered some of the shots that didn't sit right with him the first time out? It's his movie, after all. All those so-called \\"purists\\" out there, you keep your VHS copies and watch those. To me, these versions look and sound better than the first time I saw them in a darkened theater some 27 years ago. Plus, I love the new Battle of Yavin scenes, the extended Mos Eisley sequence, the restored scenes with Jabba the Hutt, etc. Okay, so I'm not that keen on the \\"Greedo shoots first\\" redo, but hey, that sure wasn't going to keep me from buying this fantastic DVD set. People all over are sounding the \\"death knell\\" of the Star Wars universe, and I am here to tell you that there are those of us out there that will sure the Star Wars legacy lives forever! May the force be with us!

B00063F8B2|5.0|I am one of those people who particularly like Christmas music, especially traditional Christmas songs. Every year around this time, I end up buying 2-3 Christmas music CDs. The ones I like I keep, and the ones that I don't like I end up selling on eBay! This is most definitely a CD worth keeping! Most of the songs on this are excellent, particularly Josh Groban's \\"Believe\\", the \\"Suite from the Polar Express\\" (the film's musical score by Alan Silvestri is just awe-inspiring and gives me goosebumps whenever I hear it!) and the older tunes (Sinatra, Bing, The Andrews Sisters, Perry Como, etc.) selected for this soundtrack strike all the right chords. The combination of the classic and the new really work well together. Overall, this is just an outstanding Christmas compilation with a lot of joyful appeal. This will definitely get you in the Christmas spirit, whether you are young or just young-at-heart!
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|A psychiatrist, Dr Miranda Grey (played by Halle Berry), works in a a somewhat 'gothic' looking psychiatric institution, run by her husband, Dr Douglas Grey, played by Charles Dutton.  One stormy night she leaves for home after work when she is forced to take a detour via a deserted road where she nearly runs into a girl standing in the middle of the road. Dr Grey swerves to avoid her, and instead crashes into a tree. She appears okay but rushes to check on the girl, who then self immolates in front of her eyes. <br /> <br />Dr Grey then wakes up to find herself as a patient in her very own hospital. She's been accused of murdering her husband,  but cannot recall the events leading up to her institutionalisation. The story then focuses on her struggle to regain her memories, prove her sanity, and escape from this institution. <br /> <br />Director Mathieu Kassovitz (Crimson Rivers) adopts a high-tech look for the whole film, with some shots occasionally looking too much like music video footage. However, overall he does deliver a fairly stylish film with perhaps more emphasis on the thriller aspect rather than horror, though this film very much follows a supernatural storyline. Unfortunately many of the film's 'moments' are telegraphed to the viewer either through the dialogue or lead up sequences.  <br /> <br />However, the film is lent some weight by some good performances, especially from Halle and a smaller role from Penelope Cruz as a fellow patient, though this is very much a vehicle for Berry.  <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|On alternate sites, I've read great and lousy reviews of this movie.  The reviewers who panned it simply don't get it.  This film takes an eyes wide open (unlike Napoleon) view of high school nerdiness and alienation.  I know kids like Napoleon and it's about time they were presented in an unsanitized way, in full, naturally comedic splendor.  \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" doesn't look down at these characters, nor does Napoleon have an insider's insight to Columbine, as one reviewer suggested.  It unapologetically presents the characters in an only slightly exagerrated way.  The story (what there is of it) is as existential as the backdrop of Preston High School, Idaho. <br /> <br />One other note -- I've read several times that the setting for the movie is vaguely the 1980's.  That is clearly not the case, despite the use of Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time after Time\\" and other music.  For one thing, Kip's internet chatting and Uncle Rico's online purchase of a time machine would have been unheard of until the 90's.  Instead, the movie is set in a vaguely 90s to present day period, with the characters hopelessly stuck in a \\"time warp\\" -- again, played for comedic purposes.  Also, Rico repeatedly refers to his football glory days of 1982.  His character is easily in his mid to late 30s. <br /> <br />My son explains that this is a movie you have to see more than once to \\"get\\".  I didn't experience gut-busting laughs during my time in the theatre, but when my son said \\"Your mom goes to college!\\" on the way home, I began to understand the inexplicable humor I'd just witnessed.  4.5 stars!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|All I've heard and read about the new Enigma album is that is doest compare to the original. Well, if you put the CD in your player and wait to hear some haunting chants and Gregorian choruses then you are up for a big dissapointment. Knowing very well how Michael has evolved since his first album I bought the CD expecting the unexpected...  <br />  You know is Enigma, you feel it and you sense it. Different style, different rythm but the essence is still there. I agree that Michael vocals are not the best and a poor choice for his songs but the rest of the album is completely sensational. Nothing short of amazing at how he can change everyday sounds and turn them into musical poetry. <br />   The music has evolved into a more dancy, thoughtful, contemporary sound, without falling into stereotypes of todays music. This sound is completely his own.    <br />   Best tracks: Following the sun, Boum Boum, Incognito and From east to west. <br />   Nothing short of astonishing, congratulations Michael

B00005UKE0|5.0|This was the disc that made George Harrison my favorite Beatle.  The last few years they were together, he had to fight to get one or two of his songs on each album.

0808514121|5.0|Here is the intertwined story of two families-the Hamiltons and the Trasks-that Steinbeck masterfully explored questions of good and evil, inherited depravity, perfectionism, and free will.  This book is drawn out of the well of the Old Testament story of Cain and Abel.  A great read-I only regret it is finished.  The almost-fatalistic approach can be depressing at times if you imagine humans as better than they really are, but there are enough glimpses of hope?  and goodness to  keep you with him.  My favorite author is Michner-mostly because he writes of places and generations.  This book is similar, but besides doing the place-generations thing, the author tosses in a paragraph or phrase (about one per ten pages, for me) that are so stunning in their crafting and depth of thought that I would sometimes would lay the book down at that point and go meditate on the porch for an hour on that single phrase.  I now have a whole new group of people who are a part of the pantheon of good and evil? in my mind (some busts appear in both pantheons): Cyrus Trask(I know someone like him), his favorite son Adam (A Isaac-type guy) his unfavored brother Charles.  I know even better the next generation: Adam's sons Cal(unfavored, a lot like the God-be-merciful-to-me pray-er) and good Aron.  Sam Hamilton is a stand-out example of good and in a curious way his straight-laced wife which reminds me of many stern holiness folk of the past generations.  The real central character of evil is certainly Cathy (later Kate).  Whew-are there really women this evil?  Abra Bacon remind me of a girl I knew in grade school, and perhaps Steinbeck is successful in making the central character a Hebrew word-timshel. Buy the book and love it as I did.  -Keith Drury, Associate Professor of Religion, Indiana Wesleyan University.

Program start: This is just a short \\"into\\" clip. About 30 seconds long. Short and sweet.<br /><br />2. The Power of Love (Music Video):<br /><br />I may not be \\"your lady,\\" but I bet after seeing this video, and hearing this song, every guy wants to be Celine's \\"man.\\" It's so amazing. She hits the high notes perfectly.<br /><br />3. If You Asked Me To (Music Video):<br /><br />This may be an old vid, but it's so great! Celine looks so beautiful, and the video made me feel as if I were in a dream. Great job!<br /><br />4. Misled (Music Video):<br /><br />Okay, maybe the video was kid of...\\"so, so.\\" The song has kind of like a \\"funky\\" beat to it. Not what we're used to from Celine. But it's something different, and we don't here it all the time. And if it was a single, then it's gotta be good, right? Nice job.<br /><br />5. Beauty and the Beast (duet with Terry Bradford) [LIVE]:<br /><br />If it's a Disney song, then ya know it's great! Trust me, this is the song you want to be stuck in your head all day. It's live and from the \\"Falling Into You\\" concert, in Memphis. Not bad Celine, not bad at all.<br /><br />6. Because You Loved Me [LIVE]:<br /><br />No, it's not the music video. But it's just as good, (maybe even a little better). I LOVE this song. It's so pure. Celine... you know what we want. Thanks.<br /><br />7. It's All Coming Back To Me Now [Single Version] (Music Video):<br /><br />Now here's a side of Celine we don't see often. WOW! This video blew me away. So amazing! I loved it from the start till the end. Uh... what can ya say? It's G-R-E-A-T!<br /><br />8. Love Can Move Mountains (Music Video):<br /><br />I know everyone loves this song!

B000069AUI|4.0|Not one of my favorite bands, but this is an exuberant album, but, as I have pointed out with many other modern acts, there is some Rush ripping off going on here. The opening keyboard riff for Clocks borrows from the keyboard solo in the Rush song 'Countdown' from the Signals album. Listen and compare if you doubt this.<br /><br />In fact, underneath the U2-driven Euro sound, there is alot of progressive rock influence, mostly from Rush...I wonder if the album name is silent tribute to this.
B000065V41|5.0|The story is an all too familiar one -- a miserly businessman named Ebenezer Scrooge (played exceptionally well by Michael Caine) is taught the true meaning of Christmas by a group of three ghostly visitors as they help me take stock of his past, present and possibly doomed future. Yes, this classic tale has been adapted more times than we may care to mention, but  this particular version is sure to be loved by adults as well as children, making it a perfect family movie. It is warm, funny and very well-acted (by Muppets and humans alike).<br /><br />What makes this adaptation so wonderful are the humorous antics the Muppets bring to the screen, the brilliant performance of Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, and the deeply moving original musical scores by Paul Williams. Several bold departures that also work brilliantly -- Marley is actually two characters -- brothers Robert and Jacob Marley. Kermit's Bob Crachit is actually one of several bookkeepers in Scrooge's employ, and the film is narrated by non other than Charles Dickens himself (played by Gonzo) and his admirable companion Rizzo the rat.<br /><br />Of course, Dickens purists will not agree, but this is truly one of the best adaptations of the classic yet. Michael Caine is BRILLIANT as Scrooge - one of the best performances in this role I have ever seen.<br /><br />A definite 5 stars!<br /><br />Cris Cunningham
0345404475|4.0|Once again, Dick delves into Asimovs' hypothetical dilemmas. In the way of stories, DADES is absolutely breathtaking...Dick's subversive communication truly erodes the moral stance of his readers. Be not surprised to find yourself questioning what you believe by the end of this. <br /> <br />For further reading may i suggest the essay \\"The Android and the Human,\\" also by Dick. You might find that it clarifies his view on the questions raised in this novel.

0060595183|4.0|It is from this book that Jim Morrison's band's name was taken. Hopefully, that should be enough to garner the opening of pages. <br /> <br />If not, then the idea of a book that, at its essence, is an acid trip should draw at least a certain audience. Huxley's cutting edge ideas move well within the bound of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, but his presentation is fearless. The man does what few of his time dared to do...question the solidarity of human perspective. His vision is dynamic and psychadelic, and should be explored by anyone willing to peek through the keyhole of their own door to perception. Hopefully, some will open up.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Let me state right off the bat that I am not now, nor have I ever been a fan of Death Metal.  The music itself is OK, but it's the Cookie Monster vocals that turn me off.  I always find myself growling \\"Me want Coo-Kee\\" back at the speakers.  Why is the Cookie Monster yelling at me?  What did I ever do to the Cookie Monster?  Still, as an avid and open-minded music fanatic, I totally understand and respect everyone's right to their musical opinion.  My own tastes run towards prog (classic and neo) jazz (bop to fusion) classic rock and Guided by Voices-type revivalists.<br /><br />So it was with some trepidation that I bought this CD, but as a major Porcupine Tree fan, I couldn't take the curiosity any longer.  Steven Wilson produced this baby and played all the keyboards (meaning tons 'o melloton, always a huge plus!)  PT fans seem to worship this CD so I checked it out and all I can say is WOW!!!<br /><br />How does it sound?  Well, it IS a Steven Wilson production so it sounds gorgeous, every note in the right place, every aspect of every song carefully chosen, terrific track separation and ambience.  As a working musician who's spent a LOT of time \\"in studio,\\" I'm amazed at this guy's talent.  As for Opeth themselves, they don't dissapoint.  Instead I came away with a lot of respect for these guys.  Great musicians all, and it took some serious guts for them to make this record.  The singer sings clean all the way through and reveals a powerful and deeply-felt vocal style.  The guitar solos are all blues-y and David Gilmour-ish.  No shredding at all.<br /><br />What's the concept?  Put it this way, if you've ever been through a painful breakup (and who hasn't) you'll relate big time.<br /><br />Will you like it?  If you're a Death Metal fan, probably not  unless you dig prog too.  There's not one bit of metal on this disk.  On the other hand, if you love the spacier, atmospheric side of prog (Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Camel) you'll go nuts over it.  And for proggers-did I mention that mighty mellotron?  Give this CD more than one chance, too.  The melodies tend to sink in slowly but once they grab hold, look out!  It's also a GREAT late-night CD.<br /><br />Best tracks:  all of them, but I really love 2 and 6, plus track 4 has some very cool modal guitar stuff.  I also love the closer, Weakness, although I seem to be in the minority here.  I think it sums up the CD perfectly.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?  Actually 4 1/2. As much as I love this CD I actually would have LIKED a few of the songs to shred a little.  The songs do get a bit same-y in pace, but the CD itself is only 40 minutes or so, so that doesn't bother me too much.  I know they were going for a different sound here  but I think a bit of metal would have shook things up a bit and made this 5 stars.for proggers-did I mention that mighty mellotron?

B0006399FS|2.0|U2's latest effort is a major disappointment, particularly when coming off the heels of All That You Can't Leave Behind. In retrospect, what could the band have done to improve on what they have already released? The tracks here, short of Vertigo, are slow, ill-paced and repititous. Vertigo, the \\"iPod\\" single, is itself very repititous and meandering, although it does maintaint an upbeat presence missing on the rest of the album. This is an album for only die-hard U2 fans. Don't buy into the hype if you are actually looking for ongoing, listenable music. Try All That You Can't Leave Behind or The Joshua Tree as much better examples of what this band is capable of (even Pop is a better album than this).
B000001GEM|3.0|Karajan is not my idea of the perfect accompanist.  Instrumental, operatic, choral -- I can not think of a performance of his that I do not find, in some way, irritating.<br /><br />This reading is an odd combination of the elegant (the first two movements are rather nice) and the grotesque.  The exxagerated crecendos are vintage Karajan.  Overall, a little too quirky for my taste.  I am reminded of the accounts of the 1867 Vienna preview of the first three movements.  Apparently it was inadequately rehearsed and in the fugue ending the third movement, the tympanist felt inspired to play as loud has he could, drowning out everyone else.  No mean accomplishment.<br /><br />An interesting document for the afficianado, otherwise choose Klemperer and/or Walter.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Let me start by saying this is a very pointless and stupid movie. And I can say, that it is so stupid and simple that its funny. The first time I saw it was a couple months ago in the theatres with a couple guys. We were at the mall and didnt know what to do, so we went to this movie called Napolean Dynamite because another guy recomended it. And let me tell you, I couldn't thank this guy enough. This is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I've seen it like 7x on dvd because we rented it. Its just a story about a couple nomral people living their boring lives. My favorite scene from the movie isn't funny, but very deep. The shot when the three of the main characters (Napolean, Perdo, and Deb) standing at the side of the dance, (shot from behind them) watching everyone else have fun and watching the world go by. But I have to say the best thing about this movie was that it was made by just normal guys. Listen to the commentary, its just three normal guys sitting around laughing about the movie and their experience making it. Its not some director saying &quot;Now the symbol in this scene is that the fire is above the ice, meaning that Joe's battle with himself...&quot; <BR>But anyway, I'm rambling again. So I'll end by telling you that this was a very funny movie. And it's highly recomended. <BR>(Listen to Children Of Bodom.)<BR>Jack Metal
B0002XDODU|4.0|Considering all the albums of Rammstein, Reise Reise is a good one.  I will not say it is the best out of their other albums, only that it can hold its own. <br /> <br />A lot of people don't seem to realize that as with any band, you have to move with the times to keep the audience interested. Without some form of evolution, (how very little of it that is noticed here on this album) people will loose interest and complain that they are \\"so yesterday\\". <br /> <br />Rammstein does what it does best.  And that is shock value with their lyrics.  They may not have an entire album of songs that become singles, but that is not how this band does things.  They do what feels right and good for them without apologies and I appreciate them for that. <br /> <br />I like this album and do not see where some people say they have lost their edge.  Considering that this album became #1 in Europe and that this band is being labled as the \\"most successful German Rock Group in the world\\", does not prove that this album will slow down the continued success this band continues to greatly deserve. <br /> <br />I admire this band's bold and brash honesty in their music, their lyrics, & I expect nothing less from probably the greatest rock band to hit this side of the Atlantic Ocean. <br /> <br />Good job Rammstein!  Keep up the good work.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This is one exceptional movie with some great music. The original name of the movie is Hua Yang Nian Hua. The movie is about a man and a woman. They are both married and unhappy with their spouses. They get close to each other when they discover the similarities in their life. The movie is set in 60s has a gentle pace and engrossing with a delightful music. The DVD comes with a companion DVD and a booklet. Definitely a collectors item.
B0000039QA|5.0|Big's Life After death is a flawless album when compared to the hip hop today. Although BIG would not be the first or the last to profit off of the drug selling gangsta image, his undeniable flow, wit and wordplay somehow made it more believable, then say, 50 cent or Lloyd Banks. From the opening intro of catching the listener up from the outro of Ready to Die to the chilling ending of the album BIG crafted a double disc rap concerto. His influence on other artist (read: Jay-z) as well as his style (read: Guerrilla Black)is still being felt in the hip hop community. The track Notorious Thugs will forever be a testament to his undeniable and tragically lost skills as an MC. His ability to mimic other artists flow better than they can. along with the fact that he never wrote his rhymes, is ridiculous. New albums may come and go, but this will forever be in the my house, car, and dorm room within easy reach.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Oh, my God. This is one of the best films I have seen, and I am confident in awarding it five stars.  Lost in Translation is so beautiful, so touching, so hilarious, so deep, so entrancing/enchanting.  Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed, fully deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar she received; Bill Murray also deserved the nod for Best Actor.<br /><br />Taking place in Japan (Tokyo and to a lesser extent Kyoto), the story is about a young, beautiful wife named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has tagged along on a business trip to Tokyo with her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi).  Although Charlotte and John seem to have all the ingredients for a passionate marriage, John is neglectful of her in ways that are hard to pin down.  For one, although she spends half her screen time in her underpants, she and her husband don't seem to be having sex.  John is friends with a cute blond starlet.  John and Charlotte say \\"I love you\\" to each other many times during the movie - but it rings hollow, again, for a reason I can't put my finger on.<br /><br />Also staying at the fabulously posh Tokyo Park Hyatt is former action movie star Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who is in Tokyo to get paid a ton of money to star in a whiskey commericial.  Bob is miserable and can't wait to get out of Japan.  But as his agent says, Bob should stay and accept the invitation to be on the Japanese talk show, because you know there are no other invitations waiting in the States.<br /><br />Bob and Charlotte meet and form a strong friendship.  Their relationship is so amazing; you feel like you have had the same kind of relationship in the past.  The sweeping scenes of Tokyo are what make the movie so fantastic.  Lost in Translation just would not have been as captivating if it had been filmed in any other city.  The film also serves as a primer for anyone considering a trip to Tokyo.  You see the inside of a hospital, train stations, restaurants, video game arcade, and a shrine.  Not many Japanese know English, adding to the feeling of isolation of the Americans abroad in the film.  Even the hotel lounge club singer is so isolated and lonely; you can hear it in her first song.<br /><br />The DVD's extras include deleted scenes, which are delightful except for the extended press interview with the blond starlet, which is literally longer than the interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray.  There is also \\"Matthew's Big Hit TV,\\" the Graham Norton-like Japanese host and his sophomoric \\"talk show.\\"  The extra contains Bob Harris' full segment on Matthew's show, from the point of the TV viewer.<br /><br />This movie has such a special quality that shows many beautiful aspects of Japan, such as flower arranging, and a bride in traditional bridal kimono.  As the bride retires, a Mona Lisa smile on her red lips, you sense that Japan has much to offer - but it is elusive to a foreigner.  It is the mix of modernity and tradition that makes Japan so captivating - well, that is part of the reason.<br /><br />The rest of the reason I just can't put my finger on . . .shrine.

0385474547|3.0|This novel has been assigned for the intro to literature course I teach to technical college students, most of whom are immigrants or their children, most from Asia or Latin America. I've wondered about the relevance, therefore, of a Nigerian story set a century ago, written in a rather formal, faintly Britishised English prose, which for most of the story takes a leisurely, rather episodic pace until sudden eruptions of energy--as in the night pursuing the priestess, or the fate of the foster son of the protagonist (no plot spoilers here).<br /><br />The final third of the narrative, with the arrival of the missionaries--white and black, it is to be noted--starts to compress the action into a quicker, more Westernised pace, whereas the previous native sections were told in the mode of storytelling reflecting not only the author's exposure to and transformation of the English he learned at 8 and studied at university in the 1950s, to play off against the clash with the newer rush of culture and ideas and force brought by Europeanisation.<br /><br />Fair play to Achebe for a balanced look at the pros and cons and the inevitability of imperialism as it sought out and conquered the traditional holdouts and wiped out or at least gravely injured ancient beliefs and practices. This novel, I believe, works more as a case study from the p-o-v of those forced to submit to the foreign ruler, but Achebe does show that Christianity offers the lowest castes a chance at redemption in this life that they could not have found within the prejudices of the native ideology. This fair-mindedness does much to create a provocative, more nuanced perspective, even as from the indirect consciousness of the protagonist, the new arrivals represent accurately the doom of the power and the order once sustained for so long, isolated from the invader's machinations.<br /><br />As a novel, and not a source of understanding this conflict, I think that Achebe gives a literary work less symbolic and multi-layered than, say, Conrad's Heart of Darkness--which I've taught to students who found it nearly beyond their grasp. That Achebe's book is taught to younger readers surprises me (my copy was in the young adult section of the library), since--like Hemingway--a rather transparent prose style may cover lots of complexity between the lines. However, Achebe's style is plainer, and often in the early stages of the work, there is not the depth below what for non-Nigerian readers holds lots to grasp in terms of a different vocabulary, mentality, and folklore. This is not an easy read, but this is due more to our unfamiliarity with the context than the story itself. The clash of mentalities will be able to be understood by my students, but the intricacies of Achebe's native culture will still be beyond our knowledge from what the glossary provides. Sure, any such tale needs to be rooted in a specific time and place to keep its forcefulness, but for readers who must read this novel for a course rather than by choice, there's much here to elude easy answers. So, be forewarned if you are to teach or be told to read this novel, for it's a bigger task than many I bet realize.<br /><br />It took me a while to read this, and the opening half moved often at an extremely languid speed, with little to engage me. The second half, as I stated, picks up, but whether this novel keeps the attention and fully engages students who have been assigned the work--who seem to make up much of its audience judging from the supplementary \\"guides\\" linked to this novel on amazon.com and the comments of many reviewers here--makes me a bit uncertain as to whether the praise for this novel comes more from academia than grassroots enthusiasm.
