B000002UB3|5.0|By far there best effort EVER... Sgt Peppers doesnt even come close to this MASTERPIECE!!!! Every song on this is great, if you dont own this CD, you need to snap out of it and get it. Im not going to go through it song by song, this CD speaks for itself, and it does so in VOLUMES. Buy it and listen, you will see what I mean...
B00013PHGS|5.0|After the yawning folk escapade, and the dissapointing adventures into collaborative spoken word, Air bounce back, and finally find out what 10,000 khz legend could have been. Simple folk melodies accompanied by futuristic synth and percusive elements. Don't forget the vocals either, this time provided by guest vocalists and the boys of air themselves. Finally, we have another electronic album to be excited about.
B000002UB6|3.0|I have this on tape and it sounds lousy, it seems when I play this, the songs seem slower, when I play the \\"NAKED\\" version the songs just fly by...I know these versions are WAY different than the NAKED versions.... must have recorded several versions of each song.... this a great collection of songs, dont get me wrong but its just the production is garbage, maybe I have been spoiled on  CDs so long that tapes just sound like crap... NAKED is much better to me.... my opinion...\\"I`ve got a feeling\\" is just awesome... great song....
0684801558|4.0|Fitzgerald's second novel shows a maturation rather than maturity.  It is a no-frills, yet poignant and focused portrait of the profoundly amoral young aristocracy boozing up the 1920s, rather than a predictable rise-and-fall morality tale.  Here, Fitzgerald holds the reins over his language; he is firmly in control, cutting down on some long-winded passages and verbosity seen in This Side of Paradise.<br />B&amp;D is true to the values of its hero, Anthony Patch, a superfluous and utterly indolent Harvard graduate who's far less sure of what he wants and likes than what he doesn't, except of course, for Gloria, a beautiful and narcissistic partner whose taste is compatible with his own.  <br />Awaiting his grandfather's demise, the young couple drinks away their days and nights because there is nothing else they can conceive of doing.  Their friends are a philosopher whose fundamental maxim is that there is nothing worth doing and a writer whose early promise deteriorates into banal tripe - a tragic waste of talent he is blind to.<br />Fitzgerald's prose and story are so deceptively fluid that the reader can miss many passive and active attitudes, bereft of any values or standards (other than aesthetic ones), towards life, family, fidelity, war, and death.  In this world, marriage is a refuge from boredom (albeit a hopeless one), work is debasing, war is a decoration of the moneyed class, and wealth itself is a presumption. <br />As, usual, Fitzgerald's strengths (reaching the acme in Gatsby) are in his ability to describe feelings and moments.  From Anthony's courthship of Gloria to his military affair with Dot, FSF never loses the palpable understanding of his own characters to satisfy effect.

B000069CWE|5.0|First of all, i used to hate Linkin park.  I didn't understand the band, and i was never into the whole &quot;rap rock genre.&quot;  this cd opened my eyes a little.  From techno beats to classical music, this cd has it all.  I am now a devout LP fan.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'm going to start of by telling you that ( De loused in The commatorium) is the bestest CD I have bought since, At the Drive In's ( Relationship of comand). Thi s ***kin band is takin it to the next level.  I'm really  ***kin tired of hearing the same thing when i turned on the radio ( kroq bands).  Nobody want's to risk it.  It's always the same thing, the same punk chords, same intro, same bridge, and same outro. Really nothing new, for the past five years, with this other bands. I mean all they do is COPY one another.  So you See this band(Mars Volta) makes the difference is something new, something fresh, and the most important thing it's good. So if you're tired too, I suggest you to buy  De loused in the Commatorium.  Not only beacause it's and escape but because it's real music. Believe me they can be one of the biggest rock bands of all time.( The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Queen, Metallica, Santana)  Viva Mexico Cabrones!!!!

B000002GB2|5.0|Many people feel Styx did not come into its own until Tommy Shaw joined the band.  This is simply not true. Styx came into its own, and created its signature sound, when Dennis DeYoung took over control of the group, both in writing, singing, playing, and production.<BR>Equinox is one of the very best Styx albums ever recorded.  Not a weak song on the entire album.<BR>\\"Light Up\\" is a classic.  \\"Lorelei\\" rocks the house and \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" is a Dennis DeYoung masterpiece.  He is currently using all three of these songs in his excellent solo show.<BR>The DeYoung/Curulewski song \\"Mother Dear\\" is as fine a piece of songwriting, harmony and musicianship as has ever been on any Styx album. Simply superb.<BR>Both \\"Midnight Ride\\" and \\"Born for Adventure\\" are outstanding Styx rockers.  JY singing the former and DeYoung the latter.<BR>The weakest song on the project is still a great song -- \\"Lonely Child\\".  Beautiful harmony.<BR>This is simply a terrific CD and a must-have for any Styx collector.  <BR>Wish I could give it TEN stars!
B000002KCF|5.0|There are only a handful of albums I always listen to straight through. To me, that's the mark of a great album. The Art of Tea falls into this category. Every song is well-crafted and superbly played. This is definitely his best album (I would also highly recommend Sleeping Gypsy). Michael Franks is not for everyone, though. His music is thoughtful and sensitive, so if you like loud, edgy music, avoid this artist. Fans of Steely Dan, Sting, Pat Metheny, and bossa nova will probably enjoy Michael Franks.
B00004VWAF|5.0|Once again, Miles changes the whole world of Music, with his stellar On the Corner album, which transends all forms of structured music from all four coners of the world. First of all, On the Corner feautres a vast array of instruments, from the electric guitar to the sitar....An amazing album....using the great post production of tape editing and splicing, Miles and Teo Macero(his producer at the time) created what one could call the creation of electronic and techno music. With a steady and trance like drum groove, along with the hynotic bass and tabla and sitar, and the wailing erratic guitar, sax and trumpet, not to mention all the other bleeps and bloops to be heard in these recordings, On the Corner plays off like an early electronic album, it's truley amazing. I love this disc and it rarely leaves my cd player. The vibe is so fresh and dark at the same time, almost feels like some king of deep jungle or forest dwellers music, so rich and almost primitive in a way, the way everything just kind of fits and how everything is so rugged and raw.,...some may argue that this album is just garbage being spoon fed to the masses, sold out miles for a sold out world...but i think that this is one of the greatest and most influencial albums of all time. Critics can talk their jive all they want, but the truth remains, it truely doesn't matter if the album is just erratic noise with a repetitive beat...it's all in the feeling that it gives you. In truth, the album is a amalagam of post production wizardry and the dark sorcerer spells of Miles Davis.
B00004RF83|5.0|John Frankenheimer's masterpiece is probably one of the best political thrillers of all time.  Burt Lancaster is superb in the role of General James Matoon Scott, Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, and chief conspirator of a plot to overthrow the United States government after a weak-kneed President, played wonderfully by Frederic March, signs a disarmament treaty with the Russians.<br />Helping foil the plot is General Scott's aide, Colonel Jiggs Casey, played by Kirk Douglas.  Intrigue, deception, and treachery are played out against a backdrop of Washington offices and political seats of power.  Edmund O'Brien, Martin Balsam, and Ava Gardner all add significant performances in the film.<br />I was also very impressed with the way the military was portrayed with regard to uniforms and behavior--especially Lancaster's character.  Very realistic indeed.  Rumor has it that Frankenheimer wanted to shoot some scenes in the actual Pentagon but was turned down (probably because of the heretical subject of the movie).<br />The tense story starts a bit slowly, but the tension builds as more the plot is revealed.  The ending is very credible.<br />I really like movies where Lancaster and Douglas are paired, and this is my favorite of them.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is the ultimate show ! I have seen every episode of GG and I am always amazed at the rapid fire talks beween Rory and Lorelai. These two actresses are so good together. I realize all shows come to an end but thank goodness it is finally on DVD. It has been a long time coming.
0142004235|5.0|The power of the written word to express the deepest emotions of life is evidenced beautifully in this classic story of love,jealousy, and redemption.  Wonderfully complex characters seeking to understand their place in the world.  Excellent, excellent story.
0790729628|3.0|I haven't noticed anyone commenting on this in any other reviews so I'm assuming this is not a well known fact. But this so-called &quot;Director's Cut&quot; leaves out several of the more violent scenes shown in an earlier Unrated VHS version of the film. These include a graphic shot of the eyeball squish scene, a longer segment of Deckard pulling the nail out of his hand, as well as a few others. Why is the heck would they not include these scenes in a Director's Cut? Doesn't make any sense...<br />BTW, this VHS version has been out of print for quite some time and I have never seen another copy like it, other than the one I purchased &quot;used&quot; from a now-defunct rental store.
0140177396|5.0|This is a very beautifully written book. It's the first Steinbeck book I've ever read, I started yesterday night and just couldn't put it down until I had read it. The words are vividly descriptive and the characters almost come alive in your mind. Steinbeck sort of fades in and out of scenes by describing what is happening in the surroundings, making it a very pleasant experienced to read this book. He picks you up gently in the start of a chapter and puts you down just as gently in the end.<br />The plot is brilliant, I love the story about this odd couple travelling together, the dilemma, a story told with a vivid and subtly humorous language.<br />This is absolutely a 5 star book.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This cd is exactly what i have been looking for a world full of pop and hip pop. The Strokes almost perfectly combined a retro sound with a new twists. This singer, Julian Casablancas, has a raspy voice that goes perfectly with the chords of their two gutarists. Every song on this CD is good and is different. My favorite songs include Hard to Explain, Someday, and Take it or Leave it. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear the possibilities of great rock

0375432302|2.0|Yes this book is a good read.  In fact it is a page turner.  However, the character development in this book isn't very good.  Also,Mr.Dan Crown seems to be a little too preoccupied with &quot;Divine Feminine&quot; when writing this novel.  The firstt half of the book was good, but then later it seems like If the author just wanted to prove his point, going to desperate measures.  Even though this is a work of fiction, I believe that authors shouldn't abuse facts in their books.  Many of my favorite authors, Clive Cussler, Ken Follett, don't use truthful facts in their books and they are still exciting.  Even though I am not a Christian, I believe that slandering anothers religion in a novel is not a nice thing to do.  Even, though there may be some truth in this book, read it for the suspense, but don't believe anything in the book.
B000002HH9|3.0|Yeah this is one of Robert Smith's worst cds but its still pretty good and compared to all of the stuff comen out lately it should be a 4/5... but compared to stuff by The Cure its a 3/5... maybe better then Japanese Whispers (their other worst)... Only about 6 of the songs on here are damn good while the others are average... Jupiter Crash is amazingly beautiful song reminescent of their older, darker, prettier music... this song with its beautiful lyrics and just beautiful song is about a 10000000000/5<BR>other key tracks are the disgustingly happy Mint Car, The 13th, Strange Attraction, Treasure and Bare... but none are nearly as great as Jupiter Crash<BR>if your looking for The Cure's older, darker style with pounding bass and catchy drums (i miss :( ) then stay away from this release... but if your looken for an average collection of Roberts happier material then you should pick this up as you can get it cheap used (i got it for two australian bucks)
0803292406|4.0|After watching THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, I realized I had no idea what these character's stories were.  Well, I had a peripheral memory of seeing a DORIAN GRAY movie, but...<br />So I dive into this book first.  Stevenson's language clips along very cleanly - the narrative perspectives are always true to their narrator.  These older men - their friendships - their distress over some shadowy character that has come into and is ruining the life of a beloved friend... I never had the impression that this was what the JEKYLL/HYDE story would contain.<br />This is no &quot;monster story&quot; - it is the story of the parts of ourselves that make us whole and what happens if that balance is upset - if one side is given favor - or perhaps if the other side is constantly supressed and never let free to express itself.<br />And a side note: Doctor John Fell (1625-1686) is a symbol of &quot;an instantaneous, intense, visceral, irrational dislike for another human being. Hate at first sight, one might call it.&quot;
0790731479|4.0|I loved it. Tim Burton made a great movie with a simple story, a great imagination and cool actors(Winona Ryder is VERY young in this one:) and I couldn't imagine Alec Baldwin with such sense of humour. Michael Keaton is sensational and the FX, 15 years old are still very correct. Beetlejuice is a very funny character and you can't wait for the moment when finally he becomes free to act. Just say BEETLEJUICE three times and have a great laugh.
B00005JN02|5.0|As some one who has lived in the GDR for more than 30 years I have absolutely enjoyed this movie.  The points made are based on critical issues of that time that made people being annoyed with the system. The film director knew the subject well because the jokes and fun parts are absolutely superb.  Nothing far fetched. I think this movie is especially for \\"insiders\\", they will understand all the jokes. Everyone who knew the system will have a blast.  Anyone who relied on propaganda to learn about  life in another \\"world\\" will be surprised and maybe think a bit differently.  Absolutely recommendable!
0380778556|5.0|In the beginning of &quot;Rebecca&quot; it is boring, but do not let that deter you from continuing.  The book gets much better after the first hundred pages.  It is easy to empathize with the second Mrs. deWinter, practically a child bride, as she settles into her position at Manderley.  Du Maurier creates such vivid characters that by the end of the book you feel as if you know them in person.  Mrs. deWinter is awkward and introverted, Maxim is tempestuous and mercurial, and Mrs. Danvers is threatening and sinister.  At times the book is slow but in some places (like the scene where Mrs. Danvers attempts to get Mrs. deWinter to commit suicide or when Maxim tells his wife how he killed Rebecca) you will be unable to put the book down.  The book is poignant and suspenseful and by the end you will want to read the book all over again.
0743455967|4.0|Who amongst us lovers of literature has not wanted to be a writer? I did. In college, I was an editor of a campus magazine, Spectator. It was a magazine that covered sports and cultural events around the campus and had some features like crossword puzzles, etc. It was a free magazine with no ads or sources of funding and so we, the three editors, wrote all the articles (with someone telling us what actually happened at events) and the features. At about this time, I was reading a lot of poetry. During preparation of the second issue of our magazine, I read Vikram Seth's \\"The Golden Gate\\", a story about love, California Style, told in sonnets set in iambic pentameter. This inspired us to write an issue in sonnets. It makes no sense now, but then it did. It made sense for Mr. Seth to set his book, which was about love, to sonnets. It made no sense for a magazine talking about one team beating another in 3-a-side to do so. Anyway, we wrote all the sonnets. Big mistake. We rhymed over with rover, inspire with perspire and verse with terse. Need I say more? One of the other campus magazines, Focus, wrote \\"Spectator goes from worse to verse to worst\\".<BR>That incident cured me of my dreams of being a poet. But if I were to look deep within me in some dark spot, I guess I still want to be, if not a poet, at least a writer. If you feel the same, then Stephen King's On Writing is meant for you. It is a `how-to' book on writing. Though well written, the book seems like a long answer to a question that I am sure Mr. King is asked often at book readings: \\"How do you write?\\" One finds it difficult to believe that it will inspire anyone to write.<BR>In this book, Mr. King talks of an incident where he wrote a horror story while in school. His teacher found it and told him that he should be ashamed of writing such a story. Though I had never read his books and my only introduction to him was through movies based on his books, I would have agreed with that teacher. Having read thisbook, however, I have to say, I was wrong. He is a good writer.<BR>Despite what Mr. King sets out to do (to write an advice book on writing) this book is not on writing, it is about Mr. King as a writer - his formative experiences, his toolbox of writing, and his techniques of writing. It is in the initial section of the book, which he titles \\"C. V.\\", that he is at his best. He describes his childhood, school days and his days as a struggling author juggling jobs and writing, leading to his first success with Carrie. He does not so much give us a memoir, as limn a montage. He goes through his early life as if describing a montage of photographs. One can almost see him looking over one's shoulder describing each picture, at the same time letting one draw their own inferences about the whole montage itself. The vignettes that make this montage are at times funny, at times touching, but always interesting. It is very rare that one gets such keen insight into what makes a writer.<br />Then, he moves to talking about the toolbox of writing and how to develop it. One piece of advice that he keeps repeating is \\"Read a lot, write a lot.\\" I am not sure how valuable that advice is. Joseph Conrad, for one, never wrote anything substantial till he one day decided to write, in his mid to late thirties and in his second language (English), \\"Almayer's Folly\\". I guess such exceptions prove the basic rule.<BR>Later, he moves on to the writing of books and novels. His insights into dialog, narratives and descriptions are interesting. I am not in a position to judge if they will be useful to anyone. I suppose any class or seminar in creative writing will give one the same kind of advice.<BR>Mr. King wrote most of this book in '98. Then in early '99, he was hit by a van that nearly killed him. In the final section of the book, he describes his ordeal and how his work, his profound need to write, helped his recovery. I think this section gives us as readers the best insight as to whatmakes a writer even more than the first. This need to write despite one's physical state is what separates those of us who want to write and those who need to, and therefore do.<BR>If you want a manual on how to write well, I guess one could always read Strunk &amp; White (which, one must add, Mr. King holds in high regard). But if you want a glimpse into the psyche of a writer, then this book is for you.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|Am I mistaken? It looks as if this SuperDuperSpecialWhatever Edition is in Pan and scan. I can find no information on a widescreen version. Can anyone help?
B00005JKN9|2.0|Other than Daniel Day-Lewis' good performance there is little to recommend this movie. Both Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz are brutally miscast and the story falls apart after the first hour. Good cinematography and Scorcese's vision of Manhattan in the 1800's may be worth a look but ultimately this is a huge disappointment.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is something that most Cure fans have probably waited for since the invention of the DVD, an accurate, vivid portrayal of The Cure on stage. After seeing The Cure twice on the \\"Dream Tour\\", I've spent the past four years looking for bootlegs and such, and this is much better than any bootleg I can find. The 'Pornography' set is the most enlightening one because they've performed these songs much, much less than the ones from the other two sets (save 'One Hundred Years' which has been a staple of every tour since the Porn Tour). Robert even said that 'A Short Term Effect' hasn't been done since the Porn Tour in 1982, in Europe. In a live setting, these songs sound just as intense and abrasive as their studio counterpart. Jason does a great job on the drums, definitely outdoing Lol Tolhurst. The 'Disintegration' set is much like the album, dreamy and visual. The lighting on 'Plainsong' is just plain beautiful, and the spider backdrop of 'Lullaby' is just plain cool (makes me wonder why they never did it on the Dream Tour). The 'Bloodflowers' set is just as I remembered it, and with the exception of a few tune-ups, is almost a sterile reproduction of the studio work. (Echo effects on Robert's voice on the \\"YEAH!\\" in 'Watching Me Fall' and a drum machine used on 'There Is No If...' like on the 2000 versions). The encore performances of 'If Only Tonight We Can Sleep' and 'The Kiss', both from the 'Kiss Me' album break the flow of the 'Trilogy', but who cares, they are phenominal performances and make this DVD even more amazing. (Check out 'The Kiss'!!) This only makes me thirst for more live performances on DVD, I'd love to upgrade my VCD of 'In Orange' to DVD.<br />The sound quality is superb and the video quality is as well. The production of the disc is good, and the menus are all easy to use. If there's one thing about this DVD that I do not like, it's the very, very fast-paced editing in some of the more aggressive songs like 'Pornography' and 'Fascination Street', along with the really cheesy digital effects used to make some of these songs seem almost like music videos (like cutting to scenes of static and distorting the images during 'Pornography'). The hidden extras aren't anything worth watching more than once.<br />Go to the Disintegration set, click left on 'Plainsong' and hit enter, and that'll give you a split screen viewing of the song.<BR>Do the same thing for 'The Same Deep Water As You' and it'll give you the 'Robert-cam' view of the performance. Nothing too enlightening...<br />This is something for all Cure fans to enjoy, and hope some more live footage can make its way on to DVD.
B000002TQV|5.0|What else is there to be said here? It's not as solid or as experimental as OK Computer, but as a rock album, it's almost unparalleled. For those only familiar with some of the newer stuff, yes, Radiohead do/did rock. No matter what kind of guitar Jonny's playing, he's one of the best. And Thom's lyrics here are as fantastic as ever.<br />I don't just like this CD; I LOVE this CD. I love every single song except &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; but those are still really good!!<br />A bit of self-indulgence as I'll rate the songs:<br />Planet Telex- (#7)- Strange start to the album. Probably the most accessible song. The lyrics aren't anything special, but sometimes less is more I guess. Good song nevertheless.<br />The Bends- (#11)- Meh. Big powerful guitar-anthem. Song isn't bad (they're all good!), just not one of the better ones IMO.<br />High and Dry- (#8)- Nice enough. Most &quot;pop&quot; song on the album. The lyrics are good and the melody is great, just don't look for anything deep.<br />Fake Plastic Trees- (#12)- Least favourite song on the album. I don't get why everyone likes it so much? Starts off acoustic and then gets electric. Song seems very disjointed to me.<br />Bones- (#9)- Rockin! Great lyrics again-- &quot;I used to fly like Peter Pan/All the children flew when I touched their hands/But you got to feel it in your bones&quot; Despite the lyrics, it's probably the most upbeat song on the CD.<br />(Nice Dream)- (#5)- beautiful, ironic lyrics Radiohead became known for. Ethereal kind of feel.<br />Just- (#10)- Lyrics aren't that great, but there's a great guitar line in there. The ending is cool; kinda frenetic as Thom starts screaming. The guitar parts are impeccable as always.<br />My Iron Lung- (#2)- song just rocks. It's about the difficulties of having to follow up &quot;Creep.&quot; (&quot;this is our new song/just like the last one/a total waste of time/my iron lung&quot;) Starts off normal enough, with a clean butkiller guitar intro, and unexpectedly lurches into the hardest song on the album.<br />Bullet Proof..I Wish I Was- (#4)- Acoustic guitar song with a chimey electric lead. Surprised to see the lack of love for this song! The lyrics are great, the guitar lead is fantastic, and the ambience is so chilling.<br />Black Star- (#3)- Lyrics are a bit simple and relationship-oriented, but they're good nevertheless. The music is very pop-rock, but it's out-of-this-world, with some of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard. The song is so jaw-droppingly beautiful, the lyrics almost don't matter.<br />Sulk- (#6)- Cool lyrics (&quot;When the loving comes and we're already gone/Just like your dad/You'll never change&quot;) over a tame verse and gloriously anthemic chorus. Not too innovative but very solid.<br />Street Spirit [fade out]- (#1)- Oh wow. This is one of the simplest, best songs written by anyone ever. Later Radiohead songs shined with their complexity, but this is just.. stark beauty.<br />For those unfamiliar with Radiohead, I think you should probably start with OK Computer, as it is probably the best album, and blends the earlier rock sound with the later experimental sound. If you don't like OKC, you probably won't like any of the others.<br />For those who are more fans of classic rock than avant-garde, experimental kinda stuff, this is the way to go. Don't underrate The Bends!
B0001906O0|5.0|This is something Cure fans have been waiting for, for years and years, a (nearly) complete assembly of those great b-sides. Rhino Records has done it again with this box set, proving that they are the marquee label of reissues and packages. This is a great update for the old tape of 'Standing On A Beach' that the first disc covers nicely. The second disc covers that transition period of when singles were first being issued on compact disc, and provides the hardest to find Cure b-sides (The 'Kiss Me' b-sides, that is). The 'Disintegration' b-sides through 'Wild Mood Swings' sides are all available already on various singles, but this collection puts them all together (and is less costly than trying to track down the out-of-print 'Wish' singles and the various imports). The remastering on the older cuts is fantastic, and the songs are put in chronological order. The song 'Possession', from the 'Bloodflowers' sessions, has also never been issued and this is the only place to find it. It's also admittedly not that bad of a song either. Also, most of The Cure's soundtrack cuts are here as well, like 'More Than This', 'Purple Haze', and 'Young Americans' (the last one from a radio promo disc).<br />The packaging and presentation of the set is great, and much more sturdy than the New Order box set released last year. Also, I'm very happy to have the discs in plastic holders and not cardboard slipcases like in the new Talking Heads box. The booklet contains a lot of pictures and interviews segments, including a track-by-track summary of the set, much of which by Robert Smith himself. In the back, there is also a complete discography with everything, ever! This set is gold on those features. There are a few things that I would have absolutely loved to have seen on here. A superb live version of 'Faith' was issued as a b-side to, I believe, 'Charlotte Sometimes' in 1981, or the unreleased track 'Spilt Milk' from the 'Bloodflowers' sessions (which &quot;spilt&quot; its way onto the internet). Also there's a demo of a cover song from the 'Disintegration' sessions called 'Pirate Ships' that was put on the Cure's website a couple years back. I'd have even been willing to pay extra for a fifth disc with the live cuts not included on this set, but that's just a fanatic talking. Those are all petty complaints of a spoiled fanboy, who has no right to complain, so I apologize.<br />This set is the Holy Grail of Cure fans who are sick of playing their old tapes or even old vinyls. Most of these tracks have been on the internet for years, given, in terrible sound quality, but this set makes all of those bootlegs obsolete. Hopefully on the album re-issues, that are supposed to start this year, the albums will be supplemented with more outtakes (I hope the 'Faith' re-issue has the live b-side version) and even some demos, but I'm getting off track. Every Cure fan needs this box set, because we all know that Robert Smith has a reputation for putting fine material on the b-side of the disc.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack is by far the best of the trilogy. Billy Boyd lends his voice to &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot;, which is one of my favorites on the soundtrack. If you are a Tolkien fan, or saw the movie and enjoyed the music, this is a must-buy. Excellent job done by Howard Shore again.
B000099T2L|2.0|I guess the CD is ok.  I think that Miss Knowles receives way too much credit, definetly more than she deserves.  Only the first three songs are good, the rest sucks. Oh yeah, and the hidden track about how much she loves her father and how she wants her husband and son to be like him is the WORST song I have ever heard. It's pathetic and sort of disgusting/disturbing.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|With unbelievable performances from all members of the peppers, 'Live at Slayne Castle' is musically flawless. The druming and guitar riffs are perfectly in sync with the outstanding vocals, making this title an absolute pleasure to watch and hear. This masterpiece has been in my dvd player for the longest any dvd has been. It's replay value is unbelievable! With awesome effects such as 360 degrees 'bullet-time' Live at Slayne Castle is a must buy for any rhcp fan or just music fans in general. If you don't have this BUY IT NOOOW!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Not only is it great to see the classic in such beautiful form, but the bonus features are worth the price itself. The interactive Mad Hatter's Tea Party is so much fun. He is Ed Wynn! Wait to select any choices and see Alice and the Mad Hatter get impatient with you. Very fun for all ages. Bonus features are great, including some things that were left out of the original. Really a great buy.

B0000931OG|5.0|I am only 14, and most people in my school think its werid I listen to Blur. Why they think that I don't know. They are so GREAT, and this album prove's it. With the great songs like &quot;Out of Time&quot;, &quot;Good Song&quot;, &quot;Ambulance&quot;, &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;, and &quot;Jets&quot; just to name a few. I have EVERY Blur album there is, and I would have to say this is the very best one. If you like Blur you must get this album. I think if you don't buy this CD your CRAZY, this is a must have!
0780020685|5.0|This is a great movie for several reasons. One is the way in which the film was directed and two is how the scenes are shot. For this we have to thank Akira Kurosawa. The fight scenes between the samurai and the villagers were so detailed and well executed that they felt real. It's like you were by their side fighting. Of course another reason is the performance of Toshiro Mifune. He's good at portraying the flee bitten crude and masterless Samurai but this time he was only a farmer's son seeking acceptance. His character was at times stupid, even broke down and cried, showed embarassment and regret....a different set of emotions than which we are used to getting from him. He showed the various emotions through his facial expressions in such a manner that words weren't needed. The story of Samurai fighting on behalf of poor villagers for only handfulls of rice is something that appeals to the humanitarian factor....something we all like to think is still with us.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is quite simply a stunning album, and very well received critically.  (NB: Madonna had never won a grammy until this album!) Not that awards and critical acclaim are important but on this occasion, it is very well deserved.<br />All the tracks have Madonna's staple sound (that make her 'Madonna'), but are genuinely exceptional.<BR>Very moving, uplifting and thought provoking.  <BR>Great dance, great pop, and beautiful ballads.<br />Staring with the atmospheric and painfully sad 'Drowned World' the album picks up pace on track 2 with probably the weakest song on the album, Swim.<BR>Most will know the singles, Drowned World (a UK single), Ray of Light (just feel the energy in this track!), Nothing Really Matters, Frozen and The Power of Goodbye.  The remaining tracks are just as powerful - Skin (a fantastic trance / dance track - a crime this was not a single), Sky Fits Heaven, the beautiful Little Star (actually the double a for the UK, accompanying Drowned World), the smooth To Have and Not to Hold, and the very guitar heavy, punky and surreal Candy Perfume Girl.<br />This is an album everyone should have in their collection.  <BR>A career highlight, and considering the quality of Madonnas material, thats an incredible feat.
B000084T18|5.0|Why all the hate for 50?  Maybe he's not the best rapper out there right now, but he certainly doesn't suck.  This CD is awsome, there are only a few songs that get tired after a while.  But, radio stations really should stop playing the entire album all the time, because songs like &quot;In Da Club&quot; are really played out and that doesn't help 50 Cent at all.  But, overall, I think this is a really good CD and I think 50 Cent is a really good rapper, with or without G-Unit.  Buy it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  You've probably heard most of the songs by now, anyway, so most of you should be able to judge for yourselves.
B00005TT77|4.0|When I received this album for Christmas and popped it into the CD player, I, like many other Beatles enthusiasts, prepared to be disappointed ~ and was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, how wonderful to hear the Stereophonics on the CD!  (Those of you who don't know the Stereophonics, pick up &quot;Just Enough Education to Perform&quot; ... it's a fabulous romp through Welsh rock.)  I found their cover brilliant, Mark Penn and Aimee Mann's cover of &quot;Two of Us&quot; enchanting, and The Vines' &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; a wonderfully contemporary version of one of my favorites.  With the exception of &quot;Julia&quot; (okay, I'm sorry, but I just found him oddly scary), the covers ranged from &quot;amusing&quot; to &quot;toe-tapping&quot; to &quot;makes me stop what I'm doing and listen&quot;.  It inspired me to break out my Beatles albums and listen to them again, something I haven't done for awhile.  Another plus: two of my friends who are self proclaimed &quot;Beatles Haters&quot; (why am I friends with these people?!) listened to the albums and announced they loved the songs; they loved the range the different artists brought to the soundtrack.  So there's that.  Which is nice.
B0001906O0|5.0|I have always enjoyed The Cure since 1989 when I discovered them.  I was very excited when I discovered that Disintegration was not the first Cure album.  It was so much fun buying all of the other previous albums and it was very exciting wating for new material to surface from such a good band.  The first single I purchased was Lovesong and I absolutely enjoyed the B-sides.  I had searched and searched for earlier singles from the band just to listen to the B-side with no luck.  <br />     I was so excited when I read that Robert Smith was going to release a box set of B- sides and rarities.  I just bought it today and it is a wonderful collection of hard to find songs.  Also included are songs never before released.  If you are a true die hard Cure fan, you will absolutley love this collection.  It was one of the best things Robert could have done.  All of the songs are digitally remastered and they sound great.  If you love The Cure, you will not be dissapointed.

B0001CCXZW|3.0|I'm part of a group of Gilmore Girls faithful. It is, in my opinion, the most well written show on TV, and the chemistry of the cast is irresistable. Don't think twice. Don't wait to see an episode to see if it's worth buying. Just buy it and enjoy! You certainly won't be sorry!
6305882592|5.0|This is one of those movies that I would offer as required viewing for anyone on the verge of, or just entering, adulthood.  See it with a friend or two when you can sit down afterwards and talk about what you think Harold and Maude have to say about living.  <br />Sure, this is a pretty bizarre movie.  And, truth to tell, I give it the highest rating because it's a sentimental favorite; it reminds me of the person who first told me about it.  Would I have liked it anyway?  Well, it's got a fair share of memorable lines.  There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments.  I like fantasy and surrealism.  And now there's even the, \\"Oh, yeah, that's the way it was\\" element because it takes place during the Vietnam War era.  So even without the nostalgia I would have liked it anyway.<br />But I also give it such a high rating because I do feel strongly that Harold and Maude deserves to be viewed and discussed by friends who are grappling with the Big Questions.
B000001Y42|1.0|Now that I've got that off my chest let me go into detail about why this band SUCKS. <br />I cannot stand hip hop, and I think it by far the worst music genre ever thought up, with death metal coming close second. Why does this matter? Because Limp Bizkit are reputed as a Nu-Metal band. NO THEY F***ING WELL AREN'T! They are hip hop with a metal backgound. WHICH SUCKS! Hip hop is boring, droning, dull and pointless. I'm no real fan of Nu-Metal either (except KoRn, who ROCK!), but I don't so dislike it that I will insult the entire genre by referring to this boring, idiotic, moronic trash as Nu-Metal.<br />For decent metal bands try Machinehead, Static X, KoRn (the only truly excellent Nu-Metal band), Metallica, Disturbed (they do anger SO much better than Bizkit), Marilyn Manson, Incubus, or Murderdolls. <br />DO NOT TOUCH THIS POINTLESS CRAP!
B000089RVX|5.0|Great voice, great music, Hell, Everything about it is good, GET THIS CD, you don't know what you're missing.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD has great music I can't stop listening to it!  If you like music you'll like \\"wicked\\" Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are great.  This is the best sounding cast I have ever heard!<BR>It's interesting to read the book while listening to the music because it's cool how different they actually are and you can find all the differences which I think is fun I don't know why but it just is.  :p
B00006RAKP|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best compilation of Elton John's biggest hits since the &quot;To Be Continued&quot; boxed set. It has 2 discs of the bigget hits he ever had, plus a 42 - page booklet featuring lovely pictures and a nice mini - biagraphy of his life.<br />Disc 1 is a powerhouse lineup of classic songs. Songs like &quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Honky Cat&quot;, &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot; and &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; were the songs that defined an era. Elton staus as the biggest star of the first half of the '70s' is made known once more with this album. Disc 2 begins with what is truly the last great Elton John song of '70s', &quot;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&quot; with Kiki Dee, before drifting into the '80s' with the eloquent &quot;Little Jeannie&quot;. Then we get the ones that really stand out from the mid to late 1980s'. &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot;, &quot;I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues&quot;, &quot;Sad Songs&quot;, &quot;Nikita&quot;, and &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot; feature Elton's unique style of singing in differnt musical genres. The '90s' material is good. There's the heavenly title track from 1992's &quot;The One&quot;, two tracks each from &quot;Made In England&quot; and &quot;Songs From The West Coast&quot;, the two smashes from &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Something About The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, and the schmaltzy Leanne Rhimes duet &quot;Written In The Stars&quot;.<br />Also included is a bonus disc that features two duets plus two live recordings that were major hits: his 1986 &quot;Live From Australia&quot; version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; and his 1991 # 1 duet with George Michael on &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot;. Also included are two duets. &quot;Live Like Horses&quot; is a gorgeous duet with Luciano Pavarotti, and there is also a new recording of &quot;Your Song&quot; featuring Alesandro Safina.<br />Sure, some fans can nitpick about the exclusion of key hits such as&quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, &quot;Empty Garden&quot; and &quot;Candle In The Wind 1997&quot; (the latter was most likely excluded because of Elton's personal feelings about the song). But this is still an essnetial collection of some of the greatest songs by one of the greatest artists in music history.
B000001EGA|5.0|&quot;Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; has always been my favorite Elton John album, simply because it's one of the few albums that could be described as perfect. There is not a single clunker on this whole album, and the production is flawless.<br />Kicking off with the comforting and sophistsicated acoustic pickings of the title track, which depicts Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin as cowboys and the record company executives who rejected their early material as bandits who they must defeat before riding off into the sunset. &quot;Tower Of Babel&quot; and &quot;Bitter Fingers&quot; are two more denouncing diatribes against the music industry that are very good tracks, and &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot; features an eloquent orchestral arrangement by Gene Wood, who arranged some of Barry White's biggest hits in the early to mid '70s'. Next comes one of Elton's best - known and most - loved compositions. &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; is a true classic with its simple, haunting piano intro, strong percussion, and Beach Boys - like harmonies on the tag. &quot;Gotta Get A Meal Ticket&quot; is a strong rocker featuring a screaming guitar intro. This is followed by the simple, almost funny &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, which preceeds my favorite track, &quot;Writing&quot;. This perfectly sums up the way Bernie and Elton write a song. Following this is the luscious &quot;We All Fall In Love Sometimes&quot;, which perfectly sums up the relationship between Elton and his faithful companion Bernie. Lastly, there's the haunting &quot;Curtains&quot;, which denounces the early songs that they wrote together.<br />Like all of Elton's '70s' reissues, this one has several bonus tracks added. Included are two of the three number one hits he scored in 1975, the soulful &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; and his superb cover of &quot;Lucy Sky In The Diamonds&quot; featuring John Lennon singing and playing guitar. Also included is &quot;One Day AtA Time&quot;, a beautiful song that Elton recorded with Lennon that was included on Lennon's &quot;Mind Games&quot; album.<br />Overall, this is an excellent album that captures Elton in his prime. It also marked the end of his creative energy. Although he scored one more number one album (&quot;Rock Of The Westies&quot;), things were never the same after this album was released. As a matter of fact, it would be 20 years before Elton would release an album of this merit again.
B00000APLB|5.0|This album was recorded and released while The Rolling Stones will still one of the hottest acts in the business, burning up the chart with their authentic brand of rock. This 2 - disc set captures the band at their best. Raw, raunchy and brilliant, &quot;Love You Live&quot; is peak Stones live.<br />&quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; starts the proceedings off nice on disc one. Next, they stormtroop their way through a medley &quot;If You Can't Rock Me&quot; and &quot;Get Off My Cloud&quot;, followed by blazing version of &quot;Happy&quot;, sung by a maniacal Keith. &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; comes off pretty well, and &quot;Star Star&quot; is excellent. &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; is taken at a slower, bluesier pace than usual, but they pull it off well. &quot;Fingerprint File&quot; is grooves thanks to some keyboard solos by Billy Preston. &quot;You Gotta Move&quot; comes off nicely. &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; is also very good, but I'm disappointed that they cut off the tag featuring Keith's standard speed guitar solo.<br />Disc 2 kicks off with mini - blues set. Starting off with a sweltering &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;, they seem to know the material very well. &quot;Crackin' Up&quot; is nice and cheery, and &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; is flawless. They cover Chuck Berry &quot;Around And Around&quot; with panache. Next comes the hits. &quot;It's Only Rock 'N' Roll&quot; features eloquent licks played by Kieth and Ronnie. &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; features the boogie - woogie piano stylings of Ian Stewart. &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot; is done with flare, although it is very hard to understand what Mick is singing. Closing the album is a fiery eight - minute version of &quot;Sympathy For The Devil&quot; that bests any other version of the song. <br />In conclusion, this truly is a great live album. The band proves that they are really &quot;The Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band&quot; and that they are legends.
B000001DVV|5.0|13 Track album including the bands second mega smash; <BR>Cat's in the Cradle. <BR>Each and every song could have been a single.<BR>Busy Bee, Come Tomorrow and So Damn Cool are probably my favourites.<BR>Vibe is fresh, positive and upbeat with<BR>a poignant twist.<BR>Aboslutely essential piece of the 90's.<BR>Unique....a band that always were an island unto themslves.
038572179X|4.0|This novel was much different from the others I've read by this author.  It was more detailed and got a little too dull for me in places.  By the time I got to the middle I wasn't sure I would finish it.  I'm glad I did, though, because the ending wraps up the story line and makes the book unforgettable.  McEwan is a very talented writer and he has a way with characterization that is admirable.  You never know what to expect from his books,and that's what keeps me reading them.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The only other film released in 2003 that gained more of my adoration is Return of the King. Strange enough because they are both very different films. I must mention first that when critics gush over movies I do get a little skeptical (For example \\"Far From Heaven\\" and \\"Adaptation\\" are good films but calling them the best most worthy film of 2002 when you had \\"Chicago\\", \\"The Pianist\\", and \\"The Two Towers\\" is a little too far from the treaded path for me) But this year they seem to have gotten it right. This is more of a intimate film where you can go see it with your friends but you each walk away with your own interpretation of Bob and Charlotte's relationship. Was it just a fun seven days away from home?  Is there a possibilty that they will see each other again? There is no concrete answer to these questions. The film leaves it to the viewer. I must applause Sofia Coppola who didn't take the easy way out with the ending and made the film leave a more powerful mark on the viewer that it would have with a cliched ending. *sigh*I can't wait until this comes out on DVD Feburary 3.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I looked through all the reviews, and even among those who loved this film, describing it in detail, I didn't see anyone mention it's greatest quality -  gentle satire.<BR>It portays the power and stamina of a gentle soul, as he floats through a dynamic period of time, at the whim of the wind, like the feather, as it pokes holes in all the over-blown and silly foibles of man.  I can see why many would think it silly if the message was not visible to them. <BR>I read the book first, so maybe that is why I was able to see this in the movie, but have since read other reviews in magazines, where it was noted as great satire among other great satires in literary history.
0156027321|4.0|\\" [...] if a boat is pushed by a wind but held back by a sea anchor, it will turn until it offers the least resistance to the wind [...] which makes for a front-to-back pitching that <BR>is much more comfortable than a side-to-side rolling\\" (169-170).  Yann Martel, author of Life of Pi, can identify with a more comfortable type of pitching.  He craftily uses a <BR>structure that pitches from back-to-front, or more correctly, from past to present and back again.  The story also pitches back and forth as it alternates between a first person <BR>narrative of Pi's past and a third person account of the author's experience interviewing <BR>Pi in the present.  This contributes to greater character development and a deeper <BR>understanding of Pi.  This back and forth structure imitates certain aspects of the book, as <BR>they alternate back-and-forth; some good, some bad.<BR> Pi lived a happy life in India, with his brother and parents, who are zookeepers.  <BR>The family decides to move to Canada on a boat and some of the animals travel with in cages.  The boat sinks, and a few of the animals, as well as Pi, end up on a lifeboat.  After a long time at sea, the lifeboat washes up in Mexico, and Pi and the only animal left (a Bengal tiger) are saved.  <BR> This lifeboat that washes up is a mystery.  Martel leaves much to be desired as he painfully describes what the lifeboat looks like.  No matter how hard one tries, they cannot put together an accurate picture of this lifeboat.  The sections of the book that describe the boat are also fairly straightforward, description in plain prose, which bores the tired eyes.  Pi says: \\"I found one of the buoyant ropes in the locker [...] I cut four segments.  I tightly lashed the four oars where they met [...] I cut four more segments of the buoyant rope and tied the lifebuoy to each side of the square.  I wove the lifebuoy's rope through the lifejackets, around the oars [...]\\" (149-150).  In these sections, the reader's faith in Martel to tell a good story wavers, as the lifeboat when it rocks back-and-forth.<BR>As the boat pitches to the other side, one can see an excellent aspect of Martel's writing- his unique character, Pi.  He is unique because he is Muslim, a Hindu, and a Christian.  The back-and-forth motion of the structure truly reflects this because it seems as though he goes back and forth from one religion to the next.  His brother teases him and says: \\"`At the rate you're going, if you go to temple on Thursday, mosque on Friday, synagogue on Saturday and church on Sunday, you only need to convert to three more religions to be on holiday for the rest of your life\\"' (70).  Pi explores his reasons for practicing all three religions.  This novel presents a fascinating view on the deeper meaning of the three religions: \\"` [...] All religions are true.  I just want to love God [...] \\"' (69).  Pi is so convincing that one will find themselves, perhaps unwillingly, believing in some sort of higher power.<BR>But the boat rocks back in the other direction yet again, and one questions Martel's methods.  He seems to present his strong opinions in a superior way.  At times he almost states the stupidity of those who believe otherwise.  He shows this quality on page 15 as he comments that: \\"Well-meaning but misinformed people think animals in the wild are `happy' because they are `free' [...] The life of the wild animal is simple, noble and meaningful, they imagine.  Then it is captured by wicked men and thrown into tiny jails.  Its `happiness' is dashed [...] This is not the way it is\\" (15-16).  One feels taken aback and slightly disturbed when this information is presented in such a superior way.  <BR>The boat rocks forward again and another clever aspect of Martel's writing, imagery, is expressed.  He brings animals, characters and the ocean to life with his depictive comments.  He describes the sinking of the ship: \\"I watched the ship as it disappeared with much burbling and belching [...]There was nothing.  Only rain, marauding waves of black ocean and flotsam of tragedy\\" (107).  Martel weaves these beautiful descriptive words throughout the rest of the story.  In describing a bird, he says: \\"Its [a bird's] big, bulbous head had a very pointed orange-yellow beak and the red eyes behind the black mask made it look like a thief who had had a very long night\\" (231).  The sparkling pictures that are created hang in one's mind for a long time, much like the bird described above.  <BR>The boat does not rock back this time, but stays in its place.  Another excellent aspect of Martel's writing is his humor.  This is especially apparent after a priest tells Pi the story of Jesus dying on the cross.  Pi says:<BR>          And what a story [...] Humanity sins but it's God's son who pays the price?  I tried    <BR>          to imagine father saying to me, Piscine, a lion slipped into the llama pen today and <BR>          killed two llamas [...] Something must be done.  I have decided that the only way   <BR>          the lions can atone for their sins is if I feed you to them. <BR>          Yes, father, that would be the right and logical thing to do.  Give me a moment to    <BR>          wash up.<BR>          Hallelujah, my son.<BR>          Hallelujah, father.<BR>          What a downright weird story.  What peculiar psychology. (53)<BR>This questioning, humorous look at a widely accepted story draws a chuckle from the reader that stays with them until the end of the novel.<BR> This story leaves the reader riveted, and wanting more.  It is a story for the young at heart; for those who hear far-fetched tales and wish them to be true.  Those searching for a deeper understanding of religion and life will find it enclosed in this tantalizing tale of truth and love.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I just wrote a review about this being a gentle political satire, and left out the most important part.<BR>What I loved is that Forrest represents the best in all of us, and through him, we see the prevailing power of a pure and simple heart, in a world, in our lives, and events, that we sometimes don't understand. Through him some of the crazy things that man creates in his self importance, can be seen as it truly is through Forrest's simplicity. Summed up -<BR> &quot;That's all I've got to say about that.&quot; Simple, perfect.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|Should have been called &quot;The Bulls**t and the Horses**t&quot;, basically just a stupid movie for stupid people.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is masterfully crafted gentle satire with a huge heart -  funny, sad and some beautiful, magical moments.<BR>I have heard it compared to a modern day Candide, which is a good way to describe it's political satire. Without that edge it might be considered by some to be too sentimental or silly, but it is carried out wonderfully. Who can't relate to Lieutenant Dan, on the mast of the ship, confronting God, looking for answers to his destiny and existence. Unforgettable.<BR>The feather is a beautiful touch - a metaphorical version of Forrest, blowing whimsically on the wind of time - so we can wonder about the places it lands -destiny or accidental? Watch and enjoy.

B0000TG9E2|3.0|What a disappointment! I anxiously awaited the new Masterpiece Edition of Disney's Alice in Wonderland -- as no doubt did many other Disneyphiles -- only to be left sadly unfulfilled. This is one of my faves, and I hoped for something special, especially at the price.<br />There is no audio commentary, and the art gallery is severely lacking. On both the \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Beauty/Beast\\" DVD sets (and others), there is virtual corridor after virtual corridor of conceptual drawings, abandoned concepts, and background sketches enough to follow the evolution of the production and marvel at the ingenuity of the Disney artists. Most of this is arranged by character. For \\"Alice,\\" the stingy Disney people have arranged a couple dozen or so conceptual drawings in no discernible order with no captions or commentary. At one point, there are photos of Disney and his staff looking over mounted art and storyboards -- who am I looking at and what are they doing? What about the input of Mary Blair, whose art informs the entire production? Where are all the abandoned characters: the Lion and the Unicorn, the White Knight? In short, the story of the evolution of Disney's Alice is almost completely missing from this set. True, there is a song by the Cheshire Cat and a segment on how one song ended up in \\"Peter Pan.\\" But anyone looking for an excursion into the world of the art of Disney's Alice will be all too disappointed (which is too bad, because the art of Disney's Alice is more creative than that for \\"Beauty/Beast\\") as will anyone interested in the process that goes into making a Disney masterpiece.<br />Why is there no audio commentary? Who puts out a DVD in this day and age without any audio commentary?
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is my all-time favorite book. The first time I read it, I was an undergraduate at Colorado State University and since that time, I've made it a point to re-read it every year hence. It's like those Airplane movies from eighties: everytime I read it I see something new. Vonnegut successfully weaves the comic with the tragic and makes a sobering case for determinism. The Tralfamadorians have a little saying...&quot;there are three things you can't change, the past, the present and the future.&quot; The book is constantly catching the reader off-guard, for one minute he might describe the suffering of an American POW in WWII, and then take the time to illustrate that Billy Pilgrim, &quot;had a tremendous wang. You never know who'll get them.&quot; Many have refered to it as an anti-war book, but I think it, much like Dr. Strangelove, illustarates the absurdity of war and further, the absurdity of life in general. At times it comes dangerously close to being nihilistic, with it's moral relativism, but it's too damn funny to be considered a truly existential work. Anyway, the book speaks to me, and I recommend it to anyone I meet who wants to understand me better. 5-Stars

B0000033OZ|5.0|1970 marked the debut of one of the first progressive rock supergroups Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Keyboardist Keith Emerson was the central figure and founding member of the theatrical rock band The Nice. Vocalist/guitarist/bassist Greg Lake was an original member of King Crimson providing lead vocals on that band's first two albums, the landmark &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; and its follow-up &quot;In The Wake Of Poseidon&quot;. Drummer Carl Palmer was originally part of one-hit-wonder Arthur Brown's band playing on his hit &quot;Fire&quot;. Surely, when these three virtuosos joined forces, the world was in for something spectacular.<br />The musical power of the band is heard from the very beginning of its debut album to the end without much filler inbetween. The opening instrumental &quot;The Barbarian&quot; as well as &quot;Knife Edge&quot; are solid organ-driven tracks full of Emerson's classical chops and Lake's melodic hooks. The 12-minute tour-de-force &quot;Take A Pebble&quot; fuses King Crimson's fantasy-tinged lyrics a la Peter Sinfield with dynamic musical climaxes comparable to The Moody Blues. In between lays some Brubeck-inspired piano work from Emerson as well as an acoustic hoedown-styled guitar interlude from Lake.<br />The three-part keyboard piece &quot;The Three Fates&quot; displays Emerson's classical leanings at their fullest beginning with a Bach-inspired cathedral organ which leads into a very Debussy-influenced piano piece. The track ends with a raving piano trio accompanied by some wild percussion work from Palmer.<br />&quot;Tank&quot; is also divided into three parts although it's not mentioned on the album cover. The first section is a fast-paced electric harpsichord-led workout which features some heavy musical exchanges between Emerson and Palmer. The second part is a flawlessly executed drum solo from Palmer which leads into the piece's grand finale, a marching shuffle which features Emerson performing some dexterious work on the Moog synthesizer. Considering that this was 1970 and that synthesizers were still more-or-less in their infancy, Emerson's work on the closing section of &quot;Tank&quot; is pioneering stuff.<br />Emerson also provides Moog work on the album's closing track and best known song, the Greg Lake-penned &quot;Lucky Man&quot;. This track is mostly acoustic and features some pleasant vocal and guitar work from Lake. It's during the song's fade-out when more musical history is made. Emerson's Moog solo which closes the song was recorded as an afterthought but has since become one of the most famous and often discussed synthesizer solos in the history of rock music. Not bad for a happy accident.<br />Emerson, Lake and Palmer continued to improve and refine their sound with each album they made. Many of their subsequent albums such as &quot;Tarkus&quot;, &quot;Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; would also become classics alongside this self-titled debut. This is where it all began for ELP. Rock music would never be the same afterwards.<br />An essential album.the Moog synthesizer.

B00005A0RI|3.0|Considering the stellar musicians here, it should go without saying that this music is beautifully played. The problem is with the music selection: one mellow, melancholy, quiet, relaxed tune after another. This gets monotonous quickly and also leaves the musicians little room for really interesting soloing since the tunes themselves are rather bland melodically, harmonically, and rhythmically. Some of the tunes, like &quot;Yo sin Ti,&quot; border on schmaltz, too. <br />Honestly, this is the jazz equivalent of New Age music: if you want Latin-tinged mood music, by all means check this disc out, but if you want something deeper and more exciting from your jazz, look elsewhere. This disc is pretty, but pretty boring, too.
0767818040|5.0|Brian De Palma's Body Double is a classic in it's own category:Hitchcock. You watch this film and you'll think I didn't know Hitchcock still made movies who directed this? Well Brian I give you every single prop on this film. It is a great thriller, great story, and great film all together. It also has if I may say one of the greatest murders ever, if not the best!<br />Anyway the movie is about a beat down B movie actor who is down on his luck with mental blocks during his performances, he'll get let go if he can't get his act together. With bad news like that he only comes home to his wife cheating on him with another man. After such a devestating discovery he goes searching for something more, when he meets a man who needs a house-sitter for his Hollywood mansion penthouse on a mountain that overlooks a complex with a sexy mysterious woman in one of the condos. Well while watching the house he becomes a peeping tom for this woman and notices her perculiar dance while stripping nude. He notices someone is stalking her and following her so he tries to tell her, but one night he witnesses her murder. It's a good one! Then he is watching tv and sees a porn star dancing on her video and notices that perculiar dance again so he gets together with her and tries to make a good porno, then solve a mystery of murder. Watch to see the ending!
B000002NG7|4.0|Most folks didn't even know Faith No More was still around when this album came out.  They had long since stopped being fashionable and the American public had gone on to worship someone else for about a week.  Well, Faith No More continued to put out good albums, gain many fervent fans and influence many other bands to come out since.  Album Of The Year is their swansong, as you may already know.  It's probably the least enjoyable of their Patton-era albums, but it's by no means bad-not a bit.  They may have went out with a whimper in terms of mainstream media, but this is a pretty solid album.  I remember being extremely ticked off when Rolling Stone reviewed this upon it's release and bashed it because they couldn't determine which genre this music fit in(!).  That's not what they said word for word, but that was pretty much the message.  If that's not the most shallow thing you've ever heard!  Why is it always open season on an artist or band when they fall out of the limelight?  Regardless of what the Be All End All of musical journalism says, this is very good.  If you like the previous albums, you probably already have this-but if you're curious, you won't go wrong.

B00005JM02|5.0|Pirates of the Carribean, eat your heart out. 'Finding Nemo' is the best sea, animated and family film yet. Once again, PIXAR Animation studios delivered amazing and incredibly realistic animation. Finding Nemo is a great movie because it has a very interesting plot which will make you involved from start to finish. It's cast is great, Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGernes, Willem Dafoe, etc. Also, the humor and dramatic and intense sequences blend in to make this film. It's humorous, such as the screenplay and funny facial expressions. Intense, such as the Angler fish scene, when its all dark and the Angler fish pops out of no where, and when you see it's face, you'll know what I'm talking about! And dramatic such as the loving relationship between Marlin and Nemo, and the friendship between Dory and Marlin. But what makes this movie so amazing is that all of the material is REAL!(Except the talking fish with eyelids and all) Clown fish, Jelly Fish, Anemones-- all of it is real, and delivers an educational impact on us on how beatiful and overwhelming the ocean is.<BR>So basically, if you've been living under a rock for the past 9 months and haven't seen this movie, BUY THIS MOVIE!!And even if you already saw it and don't have it, stop reading this review and order it now!
B00005JMTN|5.0|I usually see at least one movie per week at the theaters, so it might seem that I would be seeing lots of good, engaging movies. It just seems like a lot of movies lately are lacking in some arena, whether it is story or dialogue or visual elements, and I have to say something like, \\"It was a good movie, except...\\" Not the case with this one. Big Fish has an amazing story (always good when you find yourself thinking...wow, I wish I had written this), good dialogue, and, as is usually the case with Tim Burton, amazing visuals. This is the story of Edward Bloom, an elderly man who is dying of cancer. His son, Will, comes to stay with his parents at this time, both to help take care of his father and to get to know him better. See, Edward has always been a weaver of tall tales, and Will is frustrated by the fact that he doesn't know anything real about his father, only the stories that he told. The movie jumps back and forth between the past and the present. The past is told through Edward's stories, and they are absolutely beautiful visually. For example, the first scenes when Edward visits the town of Spectre have a soft focus warmly lit feel that really makes you understand why they say that no one has ever left the town before--it just looks that perfect. The performances in the movie are generally very good, especially that of Albert Finney who has some superbly touching scenes with Jessica Lange. A great film.
0156027321|4.0|When reading fiction it is often easy to slip into a fantasy world created by the author.  It is a rare experience however, for a reader to slip into this fantasy world only to have the author turn that world upside down with \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\".  In Life of Pi, Yann Martel creates an enthralling fictional environment from which readers will find it impossible to escape.  In this Martel's third novel, we find a descriptive chronicle that forces us to look deep within ourselves for the meaning of truth and the importance of imagination.<BR> Martel tells the story of a boy named Pi Patel set on a life boat in the middle of the Pacific.  Pi is the son of a zookeeper and has grown up around animals, since he can remember.  In Pi's mid-teens, his family is forced to pack up the zoo, including most of the animals, and move to Canada.  In the midst of their journey, the cargo ship they had been traveling on sinks.  When all the chaos from the accident has cleared, Pi has found himself on a lifeboat with 4 animals as companions: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  As one would imagine, the tiger gradually destroys all life forms on the boat sparing only Pi.  Because of these circumstances, the large majority of the story revolves around the survival of Pi, his interaction and \\"relationship\\" with Richard Parker, and their search for land. <BR> Themes ranging from the treatment of wild animals to the place of truth and imagination within religion are woven within a mystical plot.  Martel's views on religion are sure to spark the interest of believers and non-believers alike.  <BR>When we first meet Pi, he is a sweet, God-loving boy.  As he grows older, he develops a keen interest in religion.  Since he was born in India, Pi has grown up practicing Hinduism.  However, both Christianity and Islam capture Pi's interest and by the age of 14, Pi claims to be practicing all three religions at once.  This of course, comes with much disapproval from the representative religious leaders Pi sought after for knowledge and assistance.  Despite the disapproval, Pi clings to the phrase, \\"I just want to love God\\".  Within this short phrase lies what I believe to be Martel's ideas about religion.  Martel boldly makes a statement to the religious world saying that loving God is the root of most religions, and the rest is just details.  He carefully weaves the different ideologies of Pi's religions into the story through both direct statements and symbolism.  <BR>I must admit that it at times it becomes difficult to decipher symbolism from descriptive writing.  I occasionally felt as though I should be looking for symbolism in a passage, yet there appeared to be none.  While I was at times left confused, any suspicious passages were either explained by the following paragraphs or left to simply become part of the story <BR>The most distinct feature of Martel's religious ideas is his focus on doubt.  While most people think of doubt as negative, Martel sees it as opposite.  In Pi's journey and quest for survival, he undergoes many situations in which he questions an appropriate course of action.  For instance, Pi devises seven different plans on how to deal with the tiger.  Ultimately, his choice to question his course of action saves his life.  Through Pi, we see Martel's view that doubt is but a catalyst for stronger belief and even for imagination.  Martel clearly presents and achieves this ideal, and I am left only with this conclusion:  He believes that without a perfect balance of doubt and belief, a person becomes dry and uncreative. <BR>Martel himself must have the perfect balance of doubt and belief because his writing is far from dry and uncreative.  His word portraits describing the scene on the lifeboat seem to paint you into the picture.  Here Martel describes Pi's first glimpse of the tiger on board: \\"A shiver went through my body.  Between the life jackets, partially, as if through some leaves, Ihad my first, unambiguous, clear-headed glimpse of Richard Parker.  It was his haunches I could see, and part of his back.  Tawny and striped and simply enormous.  He was facing the stern, lying flat on his stomach.  He was still except for the breathing motion of his sides.  I blinked in disbelief at how close he was.  He was right there two feet below me.  Between us there was nothing but a thin tarpaulin, easily got round\\" (p.140).  Though I have never been up close with a tiger, I felt as though I was in danger.  This book is saturated with moments just like the previous that pull you close to an experience none of us ever want to endure.  <BR>In 100 short, reflective chapters, Martel manages to create a surreal world that you can't help but believe in.  As the plot grows seemingly more unbelievable, you will find your disbelief disappearing into thin air.  By emotionally attaching us to his characters, he sets up an ending that leaves us with a seemingly perfect balance of doubt and belief.  While this book may not \\"make you believe in God\\", it will challenge all readers to rediscover their belief system and will allow for thoughtful, imaginative discovery of truth.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I must admit that I didn't really understand this movie the first time I saw it. I am sure I still miss some nuances after many viewings. It was still quite enjoyable on a visual level that first time with very vivid colors and great cinematography. However, once you understand the basic storyline, those previously difficult details start falling into place, and you start feeling like a much smarter person for getting it. At least I did.<br />Okay, if you're interested, here is the basic storyline. If you notice at the beginning of the movie, Naomi Watts falls asleep and you get a visual of a pillow blurring as she falls into it. From that point in the movie to the point at which the cowboy comes into her room to wake her up, it is a dream. Here's the reality. Naomi Watts is Diane Selwyn, a former dance champion who wanted to make it big as an actress. Her aunt had left her some money when she died, so Diane headed to Hollywood. But she didn't do very well. For example, she wanted to win the lead in a movie called The Sylvia North Story, but the director didn't think much of her audition. Another woman, Camilla Rhodes (Laura Elena Harring) got the part instead. This is how they met, Diane and Camilla. And as Camilla progressed as an actress and Diane ended up doing bit parts in Camilla's movies, they had a sexual relationship. The relationship didn't mean to Camilla, though, what it meant to Diane. Camilla eventually dumped her for the director of one of her movies, Adam (Justin Theroux), announcing it at the party shown near the end of the movie. Diane couldn't deal with it, and she hired a hitman to kill Camilla. When she realized Camilla was dead (the hitman left the blue key for her), she couldn't live with what she had done and what she had become. She was depressed and hallucinating and shot herself in her bedroom.<br />Now here's the dream. Diane's dream is everything she wanted to happen in reality. She creates it from reality, adding characters that passedmarginally through her life (such as the cowboy at the party who becomes a figure to menace the director) and reworking events that actually happened (such as the limousine ride, no longer her way to the party but the way in which Camilla comes to depend on her). In her dream, she is not Diane but Betty, the name of a waitress who served her once. Camilla has amnesia brought on by a car crash, after which she finds her way to Betty's amazing apartment. Camilla calls herself Rita after seeing a Rita Hayworth poster in Betty's apartment. In the dream, Betty and Rita are together. The director is cuckolded in a hilarious scene and harrassed by the aforementioned cowboy. Betty is an incredibly good actress. The hitman is a bumbling idiot. All is well with the world. That is, all is well until reality starts creeping in. The director seems to recognize Betty, though in her dream world, he doesn't know her. Betty and Rita discover the dead body of Diane Selwyn, a name which seems unsettlingly familiar. A couple of men in a diner discuss an evil presence which lives behind the place, actually a homeless man who possesses a blue box. (I think that the evil presence/homeless guy is the manifestation of Diane's inner turmoil at what she has done in reality. She has locked it up in this sort of Pandora's box.) At a performance at Club Silencio at which the emcee announces that everything is an illusion, Betty freaks out, because in reality, all of this is an illusion. She finds a key in her purse which is blue like the one the hitman had in reality. When Rita opens the Pandora's box with the key, Betty is gone, the illusion is gone, and the cowboy appears to wake Diane up.<br />A couple of comments about this DVD--the American version is really not that hot. You get the movie which runs straight through without chapters (i.e. you can't stop the DVD and skip back to whatever part you were on). The only special features are some production notes and the trailer. I got a region 0Korean version online which has more features and most importantly has chapter stops. Because I needed those to review those parts which just didn't want to jell in my mind.

0553573403|1.0|While Martin has an excellent way of telling a story, and Game of Thrones is absolutely enthralling, I could not finish this book.  I am probably the exception, but I found this book very appalling.  It is bursting with explicit sexual material and I tired of it quickly.  I say this as an adult, I wouldn't recommend this book, especially to more sensitive readers-but others can make up their mind.  I was very disappointed as it had great reviews and I had already purchased the 2nd book, expecting to enjoy a great tale.  I ended up throwing both books away-just FYI.
B00006JKOL|4.0|1975's \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" finds Jethro Tull going for a more acoustic-rock sound, and, with several tracks featuring Tull leader Ian Anderson by himself, the album at times sounds more like an Anderson solo project than a group project. Still, \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" is a very strong Tull album. The first three cuts---the title song, \\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\" and \\"Black Satin Dancer\\"---are all wondrous hybrids of acoustic beauty and tough-as-nails rock. \\"One White Duck/0 = Nothing At All\\" is a great solo showcase for Anderson, one of his finest moments on record. And the lengthy suite known as \\"Baker St. Muse\\" is an awesome Tull piece. And, as an added bonus, this new remastered edition of \\"Gallery\\" contains five bonus tracks, including such Tull gems as \\"Summerday Sands,\\" and the flute instrumental, \\"Pan Dance.\\" All in all, \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" is a very good Jethro Tull album.

B00005V9HA|5.0|One of the most outrageous horror comedies from the 1980s, Stuart Gordon's RE-ANIMATOR is certainly great fun if not great cinema. Very loosely based on a story by the highly revered horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, the film follows the exploits of Herbert West, an impudent medical student who, after being thrown out of a Swiss institution due to his unorthodox and unethical medical experiments, has enrolled at the Miskatonic University Medical School in Massachusetts, USA.  After hours, West secretly continues his experimentation, which basically involves the tweaking and fine-tuning of a serum he has developed that can re-animate the dead.  West engages the assistance of his roommate and fellow med student Dan Cain, much to the chagrin of Cain's pretty girlfriend Megan, and soon the two are reviving numerous cadavers in the medical school's morgue.  Unfortunately, West and Cain haven't quite perfected the formula, and the re-animated dead don't seem too happy to be back in the land of the living.  But when Megan, her father (a dean at the university), and the school's prestigious surgeon Dr. Carl Hill get caught up in West's shenanigans, that's when the fun really begins.<br />RE-ANIMATOR is horror comedy at its best.  Writer/director Gordon and his cowriter Dennis Paoli are savvy enough to realize that taking an earnest approach to the preposterous premise of their story is not likely to fly with the discriminating horror audience, so they wisely milk the material for laughs instead.  Playing the lead role of Herbert West is the wonderfully offbeat actor Jeffrey Combs.  Combs is able to generate interesting facial expressions that are somehow simultaneously deadpan and whimsical, and when combined with his impeccable comedic timing, it is nearly impossible not to laugh at every scene he's in.  (Genre fans may recognize Combs from his appearance in numerous horror films, as well as from his countless appearances in episodes of the various TV incarnations of STAR TREK.)  As Dan Cain, Bruce Abbott is the perfect straight man to Combs, and together the two keep the energy level and humor factor high throughout the film.  The beautiful Barbara Crampton--who would go on to greater fame performing in various TV Soaps--does a great job playing Cain's perky girlfriend, Megan, and she is especially affecting when she disrobes.  And rounding out the principals is actor David Gale as Dr. Hill.  When his character gets juiced with West's re-animation serum, Gale's subsequent performance is delightfully over the top.<br />Many critics liken the storyline of RE-ANIMATOR to that of the FRANKENSTEIN mythos, with mad scientists attempting to bring forth life from the dead.  But it actually seems that the basic plot is more akin to Stephen King's 1983 novel PET SEMATARY.  (The movie version of PET SEMATARY, while very faithful to the book, did not appear until 1989, four years after RE-ANIMATOR.)  In both stories, an individual learns the secret to bringing folks back from the dead, but at a cost--the revived are not quite the same as they were before kicking the bucket.  And despite their failures, the individuals with the power to re-animate relentlessly keep on trying to get it right.  The only real difference between the two stories is that King's novel, though well written, is earnest and depressing, whereas RE-ANIMATOR uses the premise as a springboard for dark, wry humor.<br />The &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; RE-ANIMATOR DVD from the folks at Elite is well worth the money.  It offers the unrated (uncut?) version of the film in anamorphic widescreen format, along with two great commentaries--one with director Gordon, one with most of the principal cast--as well as lots of other cool goodies.  So many cool goodies, in fact, that it takes two discs to hold 'em all!<br />Yes, RE-ANIMATOR is gory and chock-full of sick gallows humor, with lots of nudity and cheesy (but cool!) special effects thrown in.  And some of the scenes are so outrageously over the top that they have to be seen to be believed.  But, hey, what more could a lover of horror comedy want?usly over the top that they have to be seen to be believed.  But, hey, what more could a lover of horror comedy want?
B00005Y6YB|5.0|They couldn't have picked a better set of characters to use in this movie.  Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones were spectacular as well as the rest of the crew. The story is more realistic in its portrayal of western life at that time than the ones we grew up watching.  It is a six hour movie (actually, it was a mini series for t.v.) that will hold your interest during its entirety.  This is a classic that will be just as great a hundred years from now as it is today.  As the storyline has been told numerous times I will not go into it too much except to say that it is a story of a couple of retired texas rangers and their crew that take a herd of cattle from Texas to Montana.  The events and people portrayed during the trip are so memorable and realistic.  You won't just be watching the movie, but will feel that you are a part of it.  I highly recommend the movie.  Enjoy!

I would reduce it to a single CD consisting of the first and last tunes, with Tonight, Forgive, Cupid, Galapogos, Muzzle, Porcelina, Thirty Three, Sleep, 1979, Ruby and Starlight in between.  Cut in half accordingly, it would rival Gish and Siamese; left in its entirety, it falls short even of Adore.  <br />Most of the scorchers on Mellon Collie are shrill and overwrought.  The album reminds me of Led Zeppelin III in relation to the first two Zep albums: Some transcendent beauties, interrupted by some squealing atonal hard stuff that tries too hard.

0140042520|5.0|Jack Kerouac and his friends were a part of a group of individuals who were known in the early 1950's as \\"The Beat Generation.\\"  They were the precursors of the hippies of the 1960's.  As expounded in Kerouac's wonderfully expressive and liberating book, the beats loved to write and to recite poetry, drink wine, laze around, hike and camp in the woods, sleep under the stars with their rucksacks nearby, and go rock climbing.  Many of the beats road the rails (as celebrated by Woody Guthrie in the 1930's) or would hitchhike to get to their destinations.  Ray Smith, the hero and narrator of _Dharma Bums_, does all of these things; he even criss-crosses the country by thumbing rides. Like many of his comrades Ray is a practicing Buddhist. He integrates Buddhism and meditation into all aspects of his life, whether in his relationships with people or in seeking a oneness with nature.  Ray shares in many of these activities with his best friend, Japhy, who recommends to Ray that he seek a summer job as watcher (preventer of forest fires) with the U.S. Forest Service. Following Japhy's advice, Ray finds work at Desolation Peak in the Great Pacific Northwest.  It is there that Ray, tasting of the elemental forces of nature, recognizes that \\"The vision of the freedom of eternity was mine forever.\\"   Like Ray's unique experience, _Dharma Bums_ is a revelation.

B000002GHH|5.0|I have listened to this album at least 500 times since it was released, and I have never tired of it. John Hiatt's warmth, humanity and sense of humor shine in every track on this album. A John Hiatt record captivates on many levels. You can appreciate his lyrics, delivered with warmth and wit. You can appreciate the music, not a misplaced note,everything fits perfectly and works! You can appreciate the production and the sound. Of all his albums,and I have and listen to all of them, Bring the Family is my favorite. If you still spin vinyl,and your stereo is good enough,find the Mobile Fidelity version on LP. It sounds WAY better than the CD.
0156027321|5.0|Isn't that a wonderful phrase? That is cold hard science unleavened by life and imagination. At the end of a great tale (I love the beginning as well), we are given two versions of the castaway's tale. The first is about a castaway Indian boy and his animal companions in a lifeboat. The second is the &quot;factual&quot; story about humans behaving without humanity. I pick the first story choice, the whimsical mystical one. When you are given a choice to pick which version is &quot;true&quot; you forget that both are fiction, and very masterful fiction!<br />I don't want to spill the beans for you if you haven't read it, but the description of the weird island is so bizarre, you almost believe it! What a creative author!

6304698798|5.0|This is not only a great western but a great film. If justareader doesn't like it , fine that's his/her opinion but having gone through most of your reviews you seem to like to waste your time watching a lot of bad movies because you don't seem to like anything.
B00007GZR5|5.0|While a world without tragedy may be desirable for us mortals, it is unfortunately not in our fate. Sometimes everyday people with normal lives are thrust into calamity. And sometimes that calamity is so devastating, our faith and happiness are quickly smeared into mud. If anyone can imagine their child dying in a gory accident, they still cannot imagine the internal agony that would follow. Now double that tragedy. Triple that tragedy, and you have the basis for a heart-gripping and believable tale. The character, Annie, understandably, cannot easily recover from her loss and withdraws psychologically. Her pain envelops her, and she commits suicide. As an artist, she was more prone to an emotional perception of her environment. While in good times her painting expressed her joy, it also controls the strokes of her brushes in bad times.       The movie follows this dark course, but delivers a twist. It offers hope. While delivering the audience through a powerful action-filled experience into the afterlife, it is laced with an encryption of spiritual enlightenment. Tuning into Annie's mind, the liquid texture of an artist's palette becomes an underpainting to the visual renderings of the film. Chris's journey to rescue his soulmate Annie is a moving decline through graphic levels of hell that rival the images of the painter Bosch. As he struggles through fallen souls and wrecked landscapes, his appreciation of the gift of inner life becomes more apparent. He is finding himself, as he is searching for Annie.      Although most traditional religious thought is unclear in their written doctrines on suicide, leaving the outcome of suicide victims open to mortal pessimists, this story offers a brighter take. In this new view, the audience is able to transcend the judgements of theorists, and discover an afterlife that is as mutable as oil colors on a plate of glass. A beautiful rendition. Only in discovering who we are, and why we are where we are, are we finally able toattain the heavenlike destiny that God has set aside for us.       Perhaps in the real afterlife we are not saturated with doctrination and separated by denomination. Hopefully we humans are finally able to set aside our prejudices of religious zealism and ignorance that so separates us here. Wishfully, we will discover a world that is how God intended, a world like we can imagine in this visual movie. Without revealing too much of the ending, believe that this story will lift you in the end, and give you dreams as vivid as rainbows. Enjoy.
B00005ASHM|4.0|Fred Durst's #1 Fan doesn't know the meaning of good music, or what decent English is. Durst can go rot.  Yes, Pet Sounds is overrated, but there is is still a lot to it. Some songs are just minor pop songs. They all have brilliant moments, but that's it. \\"Don't Talk\\" is a fine example. It's slow and the tune is odd, but then there is at he gentle chorus and the \\"listen, listen\\" part. But there are great tunes. \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\" are brilliant. Most of all, the album has a soul. A strong spirit. I think that's what Brian was trying to come across with. 100 years from now, they will think back to how bad some music and so-called \\"music\\" (AKA rap) was, but they will remeber the strong soul of Pet Sounds.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This 1944 has it all: perfect integration on the songs, great sets, wonderful acting and of course the incomparable singing on Judy Garland. A must see.
B000002OX5|5.0|The Who, the group who did the tragic Quadropehnia, the overreaching Lifehouse that bore Who's Next, and the raw classic My Generation, released a funny little album in 1967 (one of rock's greatest years) that seems like a concept album praising other concept albums, and simultaneously praising and prodying Pirate radio stations. real radio jingles and track jingles fill the album. Songs about the nostalgic commercialism (the late 50s lifetstlye the summer of love was getting rid of) fill the record. Keith Moon plays hard tom-toms, &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot; rocks, and things that would crop up in Tommy (the &quot;He's Crazy&quot; theme of &quot;Rael&quot;) cover the album. This was a different album indeed, but a great album. Psychedelic and nostalgic, it's a true clssic.

B00001QEBQ|4.0|Back in its release in 1998, executives at Disney were not sure of how well this movie is going to do at the box-office, especially when released in june as the 'summer hit' that Disney puts out every year. After all, it followed a streak of disappointments, films which never returned their expected profits but made tons of money nonetheless.<BR>&quot;Mulan&quot; however, was a breath of fresh air in every sense. It broke from the usual Disney concept, mainly thanks to the heroine. The title character is a chinese girl, who disguises as a male soldier and joins the army to protect the emporer and her country from the invasion of the huns. The film features the usual Disney sidekicks: this time it's a tiny dragon named Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy) and a mute, though hilarious, cricket.<BR>A major let-down in the film is its villain. Shan-Yu pales miserably in comparison to such over-the-top villains as Ursula, Gaston and Scar. And he was animated very dull as well. He definitely doesn't look as striking as Ursula or even Hades. <BR>The film is visually exotic and has a unique style that greatly differs it from other Disney films. My only drawback about it is the animation of the minor (i.e., the soldiers) chararcters; they look too cartoonish and abstract. The music is terrific. &quot;Reflection&quot; is the typical heroine ballad and is the best one since &quot;Pocahontas&quot;' &quot;Just Around The River Band&quot;. The pop version is sung by then-debut singer &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot;. <BR>To conclude this review: &quot;Mulan&quot; is an excellent movie which features a beautiful story, appealing characters, wonderful songs and gorgeous animation. Don't miss out on this one.
B000002JS6|5.0|Pienso que este album ha sido uno de los mejores trabajos de AC/DC y el mejor trabajo que ha hecho AC/DC con Brian Johnson. Las canciones son excelentes! No podría decir que alguna es mala o que no me gusta, son todas excelentes! La mejor de este album es Back in Black (La del nombre del longplay) y la encuentro genial, muy buen ritmo... MUY POTENTE, al igual que todas las del CD!!!<br />Compren este album, comprenlo AHORA!
B00005JKHN|5.0|Looking at it today, one can't realize how could this film possibly flop in its initial release. Back in 1959, it cost a monstrous $6 million to produce and earned back less than that. Its failure almost caused the company a bankruptcy and as a resault, subsequent Disney releases used the cheaper Xerox style  and the cut-in-costs immediately showed. Disney films never looked as glamorous or as lavish as they used to, up until &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; arrived in 1989. Nevertheless, all the hard work put on &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; paid off. This film is still as breathtaking as ever, especially from today's point of view. Unlike today, where every animated film is made fully by computer, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; dates back to a time where human hands used to do the whole job. And visually, it's definitely in the same league as today's features. One can't realize the amount of attention to detail (most notably in the forest where Aurora meets Prince Phillip). The music in the movie is by Tchaikovsky, so you might recognize some old tunes you know. Character-wise, Aurora is a pretty passive heroine, whereas her sidekicks, three charmingly sweet fairies, are much more effective in the story. The villainess in the film is the diabolic Melficent. She is up there with Ursula as the two best Disney villainesses ever. The film's highlight is generally thought to be the dragon fight at the end, and for good reason. It's masterfully animated and is an excellent example of how a good climax should be.<BR>&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is a masterpiece which should be enjoyed by everyone.
B00005JM0B|4.0|T3 has all of the elements that made T2 a thriller--desperate plot, wild action scenes, and, of course, ah-nold.  This movie was rumored to have the highest budget of any film in history, and every dime shows onscren. The stunts in the chase scene that dominates the beginning of T3 is worth watching inself.  it's an impressive bit of cinema.<br />T3 was a summer movie, and thus has a fairly barebones plot.  They get right to the action with very little development of the characters or story. The reactions of most characters, particularly Claire Danes', just didn't seem all that plausible considering the deaths of her family and friends she faces as well as learning about her future. One shuld not expect an accurate psychological thriller when watching T3<br />Nevertheless, despite its rushed pacing and story, T3 is worth seeing.  The special effects, especially of the Terminatrix in exoskeleton form are even more impressive than in T2.  Expectations for T3 to wrap up the whole Terminator storyline might have been just too high to satisfy regardless.  T3 does a good job of ending the trilogy while leaving the door open for more.<br />Watch this movie if you want to see thrill a minute action or if you want closure for the whole Terminator story. It is likely that T3 will be Arnold's last action movie considering his ew political position. T3 was certainly not a bad note to go out on.
B000002UUX|5.0|Well I know the title for this review is a song from another album but whatever. Anyway this cd really rocks. It took me a while to accept Megadeth because of Dave Mustaine's voice. But for any metal fan this is a cd that must be added to your collection. The riffs, solos, and etc. are just ungodly. Dave's voice isn't that bad after you get use to it.
0812550706|4.0|Reading the negative reviews is very revealing.  The majority of the one-star reviews resort to insulting those who have enjoyed the book.  Criticism that consists of name-calling is a high form of praise.<br />Which is not to say that a little bit of controversy surrounding Ender's Game isn't inappropriate.  A six year old child is taken from his family and trained for battle with other children and ultimately commits genocide - xenocide, to be more accurate.  Not a happy, uplifting tale by any stretch of the imagination.  Yet there is something nevertheless compelling in the tale of how Ender overcomes every obstacle placed in his path to not only succeed but, ultimately, grow into a better person than most.  Card's prose is at times spartan, but the pages turn so fast one doesn't notice.<br />Be warned that the &quot;sequel,&quot; Speaker for the Dead, is not really a sequel at all.  It would be difficult to find two more different books marketed as the same series.  Ender returns, but where Ender's Game is largely action-driven, Speaker for the Dead dwells upon inner turmoil and family struggles.  Speaker is by far the more powerful and provocative book, and one does not need to read Ender's Game to appreciate it.
0743216458|3.0|Don't misunderstand: the book is great. But what Hanks and Speilberg did is magnificent. They did more thorough research, they created real-life characters and they bring you into the lives of Easy Company yourself.<br />Great book, worth reading, but the movie is much, much better.
6303122647|5.0|The Night before Christmas is exactly what I was looking for. It is both spooky and funny, it is touching with great plot and beautiful graphics, and of course it is magical, reminding me of a &quot;Nutcracker&quot;, only more spooky. Beatiful music and songs really help to create the movie's environment. My favourite is the song of a girl who is in love with the &quot;Pumpkin king&quot;, both sad and gloomy music with beautiful voice and touching lirics. This movie is a must to watch, especially on Halloween or Christmas Eve.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I went to see this movie with high anticipation, considering that I'm in the \\"something's gotta give\\" age range - over 40. Also, I've always enjoyed watching Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson on screen. They generally have charisma and charm.<br />  But I was disappointed by this one, which came so close to being a great movie, but fell flat. Why did this have to be yet another fluffy romance without depth, intelligence and real heart?<br /> Keaton plays a middle-aged woman who is uptight and nervous about sexuality (symbolised by the turtlenecks she wears, summer or winter). Unfortunately, she also feels compelled to overact every nuance of emotion (joy, hysteria, sadness) and is far too sensitive about everything she encounters. She cries at the drop of a hat (if they had weep meters, this one would be off the charts).<br />  I didn't believe for a moment that she'd be THAT upset when Nicholson surprised her coming out of the shower or that she'd cry hysterically after seeing him in a restaurant with a pretty young thing. It is even less believable when you consider the fact that she seems competent and happy in most other aspects of her life, with a beautiful home, good friends and a great life overall.<br />  I give the filmmakers credit for trying to make a film aimed at those over 40.  I just wish they hadn't fallen back on so many cliches when they did.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|In music, nothing is more difficult than writing a good sad song. Too often, artists' attempts are lost in cliche'd and cheesy pining about forlorn love and inner pain. Contemporary pioneers of the sad song (such as Elliot Smith, Jeff Buckley) tapped into that part of your soul where the sado-masochistic feeling of revelling in your own pain became cathartic. But it's a rare occassion when a musician comes along who can write sad songs that are at the same time hopeful and uplifting. Rufus Wainwright is one of the few. <br />To say \\"Poses\\" is a great album doesn't really begin to describe it. Because it's not so much the music, as it is the experience listening to him creates. The son of country great Loudon Wainwright, he represents the kind of underdog quality that makes it easy to cheer for if given any sort of reason. His wailing and off kilter voice, along with his tongue in cheek references to his own sexuality are placed on display with his inner demons, almost in a kind of faux-puppet show. He wants you to laugh with him at the skeletons, rather than give him pity or sympathy. And he does it with a songwriter's touch that is trapped in the classical stylings of bard-like songs of medieval times.<br />\\"Cigarettes And Chocolate Milk\\" (one of the strangest titles of a song, ever) opens the album in a humorous look at coming to grips with your own vices....as \\"Greek Song\\" sweeps through with a waltz-like quality. Slower pieces like \\"Poses\\" and \\"Rebel Prince\\" show the softer qualities of Wainwright's voice, as whispers and quiet acoustic guitars help him fill up the tracks with a presence few full piece bands have. But perhaps the gem of the album is a reworking of his father's \\"One Man Guy\\", a sad piece that at first seems like a love song, only on closer listen do you see the awareness and the enjoyment of the artist's own selfishness in his love for his bachelor's lifestyle. <br />Very few musicians can write pieces that surge and soar the way that Rufus Wainwright's do. He is the kind of young artist that you hope never changes, even in the face of fitting a niche of music that many people will never bother to check in on, while wishing he'd receive his due by all. But he's one of the few musicians left today you get the feeling is just content with doing it for the love of making music. And thank God for that.
B0000025DD|5.0|David Gilmour is without a doubt one of the most underappreciated guitarists in the pantheon of rock guitar gods. From the standpoint of technique and skill, the man is unmatched, always playing very cleanly and with a tone that could rival Eric Clapton, but also playing with enough technical precision that he has complete control of his effects. He never lets his equipment rule him, but he always gets the most of out of it and still plays with as much soul as a classical blues player. So with his first album, he steps back from the overbloated song structures and neo-symphonic leanings of Pink Floyd (not that those things are bad, just it's good to get away from them sometimes) to create an album that is just some good old-fashioned rock and roll. There is a strong sense of Gilmour's blues and jazz influences here, as each song just resonates with that vibe of playing for fun and playing with heart. Some of the songs really evoke that old-school rock feeling, while others are just easy to sit back and relax to. &quot;Mihalis&quot; and &quot;Raise My Rent&quot; are slower, with some excellent solos and really strong melodies to just drift away, while &quot;Cry From the Street,&quot; &quot;Short and Sweet,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;There's No Way Out of Here&quot; are just straight rockers. &quot;No Way&quot; really gives the old-school blues feel a kick. The album is chock-full of Gilmour's signature sound, and he does really cut loose occasionally. The loud sliding solos on &quot;It's Deafinitely&quot; are just blistering...you could almost picture Gilmour's face tightening with intensity from the sound. All in all, it's a very good album from an amazing guitarist. Nothing really exceptional or special...just that damn good.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|They really did a great job on the image in this DVD!<BR>1. The backgrounds are super clear. You can literally see every brushstroke. On some backgrounds, you can even see the grain of the illustration board they were painted on. WOW!(The backgrounds on the older Alice DVD were always muddy and contrasty.) <BR>2. The same goes for the characters. The ink lines delineating each moving thing are sharp and clear. Goodbye ugly film grain!<BR>3. Colors have been corrected. On the older DVD, Dinah the cat looked almost pinkish-red, and the Mad Hatter's skin tone looked like he had a heat rash. On the new DVD, Dinah is reddish brown, and the Hatter is slightly in the pink. <BR>4. The film transfer on the older version tended to wobble around    slightly as the film went through the machine. The new version does NOT wobble at all. Steady as she goes!<BR>This new DVD version looks as good as(if not better than) ANY animated film created on state-of-the-art equipment these days. Sounds great, too.<BR>So, how were the bonus features?<BR>*The Cheshire Cat song--Good recording of a man who sounds remarkably like the late Sterling Holloway. Nice to see Kathryn Beaumont introduce it.<BR>*Sing Alongs--If Karaoke is your thing, here ya go.<BR>*Adventures in Wonderland set-top game--Not particularly challenging (yawn).<BR>*Through the Mirror Mickey Mouse Cartoon--Nice extra.<BR>*Trailers--Great to have.<BR>*From Wonderland to Neverland--Right on! I never knew that the opening theme to Peter Pan was originally composed as Alice's daydream song. Kathryn Beaumont talks about this fascinating aspect.<BR>*Operation Wonderland, Fred Waring Show, One Hour in Wonderland--Valuable from a historical point of view. Why NOT include them here?! <BR>*Alice Comedy--Interesting to see that Walt Disney's original cartoons weren't all that super. <BR>*Virtual Wonderland Party--I probably would have loved this if I were 4 or 5. They could have used this extra disc space to put on a running commentary of the film with Kathryn Beaumont, a Disney film historian and an animator or two.....<BR>*Song Demos--interesting!<BR>*Art Galleries--Mary Blair's color sketches reveal how much she influenced this film and are a treat for the eye. What a small number of them were included here!<BR>Great Disc, beautiful presentation! A real treat for the eye and ear.
B0000C7PSW|2.0|I'm pretty much amazed at how much credit this guy gets for, well, not producing all that much. It sounds to me like audiences are largely responding positively to the production of the album: the arrangements, the instrumentation, the mix, the sound quality. And I just don't believe those are aspects one can accurately attribute to Wainwright.<br />If the album was released under producer Marius deVries' name, in collaboration w/ singer/songwriter Rufus Wainwright, I'd have a better response to the integrity of the project. I realize that the singer/songwriter is usually the one whose album it is, but if, as so many reviewers have noticed, the styles on Want One are throwbacks to rarely-mined, almost anachronistic styles of yesteryear, then perhaps it's more appropriate to follow the practices of yesteryear, where the bandleader (in this case, the producer, deVries) choses others' songs and singers and released the album under his name.<br />I'm underwhelmed by the songs. You gotta figure that most people, including me, would rather postitively review an album -- why bother spending time w/ a negative review? -- but in this case, I wonder whether all of the fawning over Rufus' consistently mediocre efforts does him a disservice. I must mention the greater disservice all this attention does to better songwriters who receive far less attention, especially to Out Gay songwriters like Barnes, Robin Renee, Bob Mould, John Bucchino, the members of Pansy Division and of Girlyman, and so many more. None of these folks can muster the major-label push that Dreamworks can. All of them are trying - and succeeding - at creating new, original, distinctive music without having anywhere near the financial resources of Wainwright. And all of those mentioned are creating, struggling, and enjoying an exciting but disappointingly modest amount of recognition and success, all in distinctly different musical genres.<br />And none of them requires the amount of producer-generated propping up to make their songs sound half-way decent. When I consider how Rufus' songs might sound without the arrangements, as mentioned, I am underwhelmed.<br />Credit where due: I like Beautiful Child. And Go Or Go Ahead has improved with repeated listenings.<br />Finally, even after three albums, his voice just sounds mushy, like he has paid barely any attention to it. Even David Byrne took voice lessons, and continued through much of his career to try to improve his modest vocal gifts, resulting in some of the best music of the last quarter of the 20th century. Rufus always sounds like he has never warmed up his voice. He always sounds like he's too lazy to open his mouth wide enough to let the entirety of the words out. He always sounds like he'll destroy his voice before he hits 30. When he's 40 or 50, and wants to put out Rod Stewart-like \\"standards\\" albums with his ever more limited vocal \\"talents\\", will audiences standards be so low as to eagerly snatch those up too?<br />I guess some folks really do enjoy mush.ng up to make their songs sound half-way decent.

B0000508U6|1.0|Okay, I know they're the darlings of the alt-pop movement.  And, yes, I love Rush of Blood to the Head.  In fact, I would call Rush of Blood to be one of pop music's most complete successes.  But Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, is a stinker.  Thin, derivative and colorless, this is one of the biggest head-scratchers I've ever come across.  Granted, Yellow and Trouble are worth owning - so buy the singles.  The rest of this cd contains some real forgettable slop.  Shiver, while a fan favorite, is not that great a song.  Spies is dull.  High Speed embarrassing.  A major disappointment all the way around.  Martin &amp; Co. are lucky they survived long enough to make a second, and markedly better, cd.  My copy of Parachutes is already back at my local record store, warming up the bargain bin and selling for five bucks and change.  In my opinion?  Not even worth that.
B000089RVX|5.0|Too many people now days are so wrapped up in genres that they don't think about music.  Good music is good music, who cares what kind of &quot;group&quot; you want it to be clumped in with?  I've seen people griping that this isn't &quot;goth&quot;, &quot;Christian&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, or &quot;metal&quot;.  In all actuallity, who cares?  Being a musician myself, I hate it when one of my songs is clumped into a genre it wasn't necessarily meant to be in.  It limits opportunities.  I don't do genres.  I do music.  I suggest you people do the same.  Stop fighting over what it's supposed to be, and just enjoy it for what it is.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|now, given, i wasn't ever into britney.  just not really my kind of music.  i must admit, though, this CD is a lot better.  it sounds nothing like her old stuff which, as far as i'm concerned, is an improvement by all accounts.  there are two gaping flaws, however, both being because it is still britney spears.  the voice has gotten on the whole more obnoxious, being even more nasally, or half-whispering, in the attempt to sound hot.  the other problem is they lyrics, and man are they bad. not once did i ever enjoy the lyrics, more often i cringed.  this said, the people actually making the music on the album have improved, as has the overall sound.  it is dance music, with a good beat, etc.  as far as music to dance to, this is an exceptional cd.  if you're looking for that, most definitely get it; if you're looking for any intelligent lyrics, or anything really musically satisfying, i would suggest looking elsewhere.
B000060P79|1.0|These guys are the epitome of crap. The singer sings about heart break and stuff but you would never know because he sings like he is happy. He has no emotion even though it may be the worst day ever. Yeah every day is bad after listing to this junk.
B000060MWU|5.0|The DVD Transer quality is beyond awful! The movie itself<BR>is excellent! What else could you expect from The brilliant David Lynch? I bought this film because I'm clearly a David Lynch fan, BUT the DVD quality is just sooo bad it makes it extremely difficult to watch. With terrible quality like this (from a DVD) - you might as well get the VHS.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Much has been written about the sparse acting and plot. The plot actually wasn't that bad (although a little Star-Trek like). I overall liked this movie except for Kraven, who just plain can't act. But once again, Kate is sooo cool and hot that she literally carries the movie on her back. Unfortunately her performance makes the other performances show as being hideous. Nice cinematography - sure it rips off the matrix. Also disappointing that it didn't show more vampire changes.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie (Next to Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Reservoir Dogs). Tarantino is the best director i've ever seen. This movie is so cool with its non-stop action and its sick style for killing. The story to the movie is easy to follow and the action is the coolest. Anyone who said that this movie bad won't know a good movie if it smacked them in the face. Tarantino's movies are the greatest and thats all I have to say until...Kill Bill Vol.2
B00005JLKB|3.0|I found first season to be pretty good actually. The pilot episode was one of the best episodes, I especially liked the meteor shower scenes, most of them well done and the scene wher Lex's Porsche runs off the bridge sending Clark off the edge with it still looks unbelievably real to me. <BR>The casting is pretty good, some new characters introduced to the story line but all well portrayed and I even liked most of the plots. I'd read that first season was known for it's freak of the week episodes but they really aren't that bad, and some of them are even sort of creative. <BR>I just wish that Clark would finally manage to fly, it's been most of three years now and all he's managed is to levitate during a dream about Lana, and maybe fly to her rescue during the season ending tornado.
B000059MEK|5.0|If you like dance music or just music, this is the CD to get. Blinding jazz and techno, this CD open a new view on dance music.<BR>The Discovery album by Daft Punk, is &quot;off tha chain.&quot; Not to force you to buy it but, it is surely worth the money. If you don't believe me check out the samples. I've done all I can do to convence you, so now it's up to you....
B00008AY3L|1.0|Oh my God! I mean, some guys invited me to this party and they were all drinking and laughing and yelling and then this music started playing and everyone was yelling and drinking and cheering. But really, I mean, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. It was like everyone was laughing and cheering and yelling and drinking just for the sake of laughing and cheering and yelling and drinking. Oh my God, I think everybody likes the same stuff just because everybody else likes the same stuff and everybody else likes the same stuff. I mean, like, am I an individual or just some arbitrary point in the giant mass of society. What am I? Where am I? Does evolution lead towards one or many?
0613325419|4.0|This is a reprint by Obscurus House of Newton Artemis Fido Scamander's classic magizoological reference work. Forward by Albus Dumbledore. This particular edition is the first to be offered to the non-wizarding public.<br />The introduction covers the classification of magical creatures into beings, beasts, or spirits. The history, politics, and fine points of this division is examined.<br />Next, there is a section on the concealment of magical beasts from the non-wizarding public. This includes the establishment of safe habitats, as well as the use of disillusionment charms, memory charms, and other techniques. The activities of the Office of Misinformation in spreading false information are also examined.<br />The Ministry of Magic classifications of all known magical creatures from XXXXX (known wizard killer) to X (positively boring) are listed and defined.<br />The main body of the reference lists all known magical creatures alphabetically. The M.O.M. classification, physical description, habitat, behavior, and distribution are clearly and concisely noted for each entry. These entries are: Acromantula, Ashwinder, Augurey, Basilisk, Billywig, Bowtruckle, Bundimum, Centaur, Chimaera, Chizpurfle, Clabbert, Crup, Demiguise, Diricawl, Doxy, Dragon (all breeds), Dugbog, Erkling, Erumpent, Fairy, Fire Crab, Flobberworm, Fwooper, Ghoul, Glumbumble, Gnome, Graphorn, Griffin, Grindylow, Hippocampus, Hippogriff, Horklump, Imp, Jarvey, Jobberknoll, Kappa, Kelpie, Knarl, Kneazle, Leprechaun, Lethifold, Lobalug, Mackled Malaclaw, Manticore, Merpeople, Moke, Mooncalf, Murtlap, Niffler, Nogtail, Nundu, Occamy, Phoenix, Pixie, Plimpy, Pogrebin, Porlock, Puffskein, Quintaped, Ramora, Red Cap, Re'em, Runespoor, Salamander, Sea Serpent, Shrake, Snidget, Sphinx, Streeler, Tebo, Troll, Unicorn, Werewolf, Winged Horse, and Yeti.<br />I have only two questions concerning this edition: 1) why are there so few illustrations, and 2) why no Blast-Ended Skrewts?
B00005NB0H|5.0|When the Who originally released this concert as a six song LP, it was still considered a classic in its own right, despite its brevity.  In 1995, when many of the Who classic albums wer remastered and previously unreleased tracks added, it doubled the length of the &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; concert and was now a live album of hard rhythm and blues for more than just the Who collectors.  It now featured classic songs, the original Who mini-opera (&quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot;), a couple of tracks from their full length rock-opera &quot;Tommy,&quot; and several R &amp; B and rock and roll covers.  It was a full fledged classic, who's power and purity neither fan nor critic could deny.  And now my friends, it is the greatest live album in existence, for the entire concert from that night at Leeds College in 1970 is released in the much needed 2 disc format and given the much deserved Deluxe Edition treatment.  <br />Many quip that the concert &quot;isn't perfect&quot; because the four songs that comprised the encore, including &quot;Summertime Blues,&quot; &quot;My Generation,&quot; and the definitive version of the infamous &quot;Magic Bus&quot; are put at the end of disc one instead of disc two.  But disc two is comprised solely of the hour long performance of the Who's magnum opus and easily their greatest achievement &quot;Tommy.&quot;  If the performance of Tommy was to be spread over two discs, it would take from the consistency of the show.  Thus, how the concert is layed out in this format (by Pete Townsend) is the best way.<br />With that out of the way, on to the music.  It's the most raw, vital, young, happy, pure, fun, and yes, BEST, the Who ever sounded on record, live or studio.  Some point to their debut as their heaviest infused R &amp; B effort.  That may be true, but of the two, &quot;Leeds&quot; has the better chops, better music, by far the better guitar outing from Townsend (He is absolutely stunning on these two discs), and the better rhythm section; Keith's drumming and John's bass lines were and are unimmitable.  Most of the songs sound better here than they do on their original studio recordings including &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; &quot;Can't Explain,&quot; &quot;Tatoo,&quot; &quot;A quick One,&quot; and of course &quot;Magic Bus.&quot;  The &quot;Tommy&quot; section is incredible also.  Don't worry purists!  It sounds amazing live, too.  Pete's guitar work is masterful, as is Roger Daltry's singing.  Yes, he does strain to reach some of the high notes, but he does it in confidence and its a device for the listener to believe that this album actually WAS made by human beings.  In essence, its raw, and that's good; you see the amazing &quot;Tommy&quot; done without instruments and shine.  Just four guys playing their hearts out in an intimate setting.  It's fabulous and worth the $30.  Trust me on that.  A perfect record.  Overall: 10 out of 10.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Shows about teenagers are often terrible. We (the viewers) are often forced to watch ludicrous &quot;realistic&quot; teen shows like &quot;The OC&quot; and &quot;90210&quot; when we know that they (the teen shows) don't even come close to accurately portraying teen life. Every once in a while we (the young adults) are blessed with more realistic shows like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer,&quot; &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot; and &quot;Smallville.&quot; These shows (with the exception of Dawson's Creek) are sci-fi fantasies but they ironically portray teen life in a more accurate light than any crappy Aaron Spelling Fox teen drama ever could. Smallville is brilliant because Clark Kent's problems with his powers offer a great metaphor for any kid that has ever felt different in high-school. It doesn't matter how popular or unpopular we were in high-school: we have all felt like an outcast at one time or another. Clark Kent and Buffy, (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) like Spiderman, will always be great representations of our inner-outcast. They may fight monsters or Demons but they have the same problems we did. Smallville (over the years) has addressed many different teen issues like eating disorders and drug-use in a way that is more believable than any &quot;very special episode&quot; of 90210 or &quot;The OC.&quot;<br />This DVD set contains the first season of the series. We are introduced to a teenage Clark Kent and a young Lex Luther. We see how they slowly start to grow into their future roles as Superman and the most evil man in Metropolis. We see Clark painfully deal with issues that we have all faced as he accepts his true destiny.<br />I am so happy that the first season is on DVD. I can slowly get rid of my old VHS tapes of the first season that have been taking up too much room in my house. This DVD is a nice set that looks great on a decent TV. You will certainly be entertained if you buy this collection. I can't wait for season two!
B00008OWZC|4.0|Though their first four records would soon become the nails upon which all other rock records would hang, Led Zeppelin was ultimately a live band.  No studio recording could ever display Robert's finesse and on stage quirks, nor Page's genious, nor Bonzo's confidence, nor Jones' staple bass work.  The equipment could never do their power justice.  A futile attempt (never-the-less, THE attempt) at putting a live performance on record was found in the film documentray album &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; but the band was past its prime; the dinosaur effect began taking its toll.  Years went by and those of us too young to experience Zeppelin live had only their imaginations to catch up with the myth.<br />Finally, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is released 30 years after the fact to rave reviews, most of which it deserves.  It IS the best live Zep album.  My problem is it's essentially the ONLY live Zep album (though BBC sessions is quite interesting and bluesy).  It is a great performance complete with the long performances of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; that we've come to hear about.  These are all pros.  But to catch Zeppelin in their most raw and pure form would be to hear them during their II or III years-- maybe right before IV was released.  My reasoning is simple.  Before IV they were a warts-and-all blues metal band.  THE blues metal band.  Their covers of Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters tunes were breathtaking and they had something to prove and something new to show every night.  After IV, the were rock stars.  They played in front of thousands weekly, wore sequins, became millionares, and bloated synthesizers slowly took over Page's majestic Gibson.  Don't take this as a IV knock.  It's the most popular heavy metal album of all time and deservingly so, but it changed things.  Led Zeppelin now sounded better in the studio on two great albums-- the classic 5 star &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and the pretentious&quot;Physical Grafitti&quot;-- followed by two proper albums that had a couple good songs a piece and then an album of unreleased material (8 songs) as a disbanded note after the death of Bonham.<br />So while this album is amazing and defintely worth having (the first disc is spellbinding and the two other discs are chock full of bluesy goodness), it would be great to see them make a live album a la the first disc of the Zeppelin DVD collection.  Back when blues was the game and they were just kids offering the world the greatest rock and roll experience there was.  Overall:  8 out of 10.
0930289234|4.0|Most simply stated, WATCHMEN was the graphic novel that totally changed the comic book industry. The book is a deconstruction of comics. The book also forces a person to challenge the way they view life and the events that go on in the news. Besides all that, it's a great story, too. Still, with all that said, WATCHMEN isn't a great piece of literature (though it comes pretty close) there's just too many comic conventions involved in both the art and story. Whatever the case, if you're a fan of comics at all or have an interest in the history of pop culture, this is one of the graphic novels you should read.
B00005LMBK|3.0|This trendy, overhyped record became a favorite of a lot of people a coulpe of years ago, in part due to the clever, original videos that appeared everywhere. The first &quot;virtual&quot; band offers a fresh album, mixing a bit of everything so there`s something for everyone to find here. It isn`t, however, a great record, even if it has some very good moments worth discovering. At parts it becomes tiresome, like in the excessive minimalism of &quot;Double Bass&quot;, the repetitive nature of &quot;Man Research&quot; or the unengaging &quot;New Genious&quot;. It`s a tad too long, either, even if it`s enjoyable for the most part. Some shining moments include the dark, trip-hoppish &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, the weird soundscapes of &quot;Sound Check&quot; or the creative cuban pop in &quot;Latin Simone&quot;. The band creates an intriguing combo of references that joins hip-hop, punk, pop, electronica, spoken word and everything else, making for an addictive musical cocktail. This kind of thing has been done before, however, by artists like the Beastie Boys, Bran Van 3000, Cibo Matto, Luscious Jackson or even Beck. Still, it works well enough, being one of the most interesting urban pop albums of the last years.
B000002MY3|4.0|Watched the 22 Greatest thing on mtv2 today, and this album seemed to have won the best album of the last 30 years on that show.  A misplaced accolade I must say, although I have been known to say I love this album.  So I took it out and listened to it again, its a pleasant memory of my youth.  At the time it came out, it seemed like a glossed up Liz Phair to me, and of course gloss isn't a good thing.  But in retrospect, that was just a reaction to Alanis's populatity not her music.  I of course, let my indie defenses down, and just enjoyed it.  This is an example of what can happen when pop accessibility and lyrical earnestness are given equal importance.  You get a horde of catchy songs that can resonate because of the lack of vapidity behind them.  You get the visceral impact only a good pop song can give you, but then you can see the heart and soul that are in the lyrics.  It's a good combination, that and Alanis's absolute lack of polish in her vocals, she wails and goes off-key in a very eerily endearing way, so thumbs up to that.  A 90's classic to be sure, and an album worthy of the attention and sales it garnered.
B00004X01U|3.0|After the sucessful &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, probably her best album, Madonna released &quot;Music&quot;, a record that showed a less introspective and meditative feel and instead offered a more upbeat, colourful approach. While not as interesting as that key album, &quot;Music&quot; still has a lot to offer, like good pop songs, something that seems so rare today. The electronic sounds are again used, as producers William Orbit and Mirwais give a hand in most of the songs. There are some french touch/ Daft Punk influences in the energetic &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; or the great ballad &quot;Nobody`s Perfect&quot;, as the queen of pop uses a vocoder to give her voice a twist. Other highlights include the quiet, contemplative love song &quot;I Deserve It&quot; or the poppy and dazzling &quot;Amazing&quot;. Sure, the lyrics aren`t the best out there but they`re not bad for a mainstream album, and as a whole the record suceeds on bringing some refreshing and amusing elements to the wide world of pop. Good Music.
B00006M183|5.0|I know that this review is a little late in arriving on the pages of amazon.com, but the extra time has allowed me to truly see the beauty in this CD.  I bought this CD in a fervor of excitement in Fall 2002.  I had recently gotten into Pearl Jam and was so happy.  However, I soon found that I had not yet developed a taste for new Pearl Jam.  My ears were attuned to the sounds of &quot;Ten&quot; and Vs.&quot;  I was certainly not ready for &quot;Riot Act.&quot;  So I sort of shelved the CD.  During the next few months I found myself falling in love with the sounds from &quot;Vitalogy&quot; and &quot;Yield&quot; and &quot;Binaural.&quot;  However, the most important fact I've found with Pearl Jam albums is to listen to them through several times.  That is how I have made break throughs with all of the aforementioned albums.  I am about to start my work on &quot;No Code.&quot;<br />Anyways, &quot;Riot Act&quot; is an incredible piece of work.  &quot;Save You&quot; is so hard, and sad at the same time.  It is SO good.  I don't think I can make it through a day without listening to &quot;Thumbing My Way,&quot; and &quot;You Are&quot; anymore.  &quot;LBC&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot;, and &quot;Cropduster&quot; also make an excellent streak.  <br />So, my advice to you, prospective Pearl Jam buyer, is to buy ALL Pearl Jam you see and give it time to sink into your head.  Then you will know the love I have for this most wonderful band.
B00000F3KL|1.0|What a disaster...This &quot;movie&quot; focuses one U.S. army mission during the Somalian Civil War in 1993, exploring the soldier`s experiences and obstacles. The problem is, most of the movie is just a collection of big, long, loud and tedious fight sequences that last more than 2 hours. The photography is good and creates a realistic and gritty feel, that almost seems like a documentary. The explosions are also well done and directed, but apart from that there`s nothing to recommend here. The characters are one-dimensional, comic book-like, and end up being flat and generic. There`s not much of a plot, either, as the movie drags with countless fight situations, chases and deaths. It`s not too patriotic, especially when compared with melodramatic stuff like &quot;Pearl Harbour&quot;, but that doesn`t help much when the movie is so weak and uninteresting. Most of it seems like a mix between a documentary and a video clip, and the result disappoints and doesn`t convince. This is one to avoid.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I saw this show in San Francisco at its pre-Broadway run.  The music on this disc is an improvement.<br />My one complaint:  Why no synopsis?!<br />I read the Maguire book, and I know the musical story has been changed, condensed, and Stephen Schwartz-ed.  Whoever put the CD liner notes together has done listeners wrong by omitting a synopsis.
0385504209|4.0|After reading some of the other reviews for this book, I just had to chime in too.  First, the book.  I found it engrossing and highly addictive, and had a hard time putting it down, even to tend to my own family.  It is a fast read, and grabs the reader's attention from the very first page.<br />The facts of the book are NOT at all imagined.  I find it hilarious and ignorant that review writers such as Ms. Low would foist their own, deluded notions of the &quot;truth&quot; of Christianity onto the rest of us when they're supposed to be writing a book review.<br />Through my own research, I have found that while the &quot;seasoning&quot; or the loose story line that the plot falls around, is Dan Brown's own fiction, the &quot;meat&quot; of the story, the legend of the Holy Grail, and symbolism involving the Rose and the Chalice, and the accounts of the true purpose and organization of the Knights Templars, is quite accurate and astonishing.<br />It is also ironic that in writing a book review about a book that talks about the Bible's &quot;truths&quot; as being only as &quot;true&quot; as the collaborators of the bible wanted them to be, that other reviewers would wretchedly refer to the Bible as the &quot;real truth.&quot;<br />By the way, Ms. Low, how are you certain that the Gospel of Phillip is make-believe?  I thought you said your degree was in Art.  Not only that, but did you know that Messiah and Saviour are nearly interchangeable in the Aramaic texts?  Although, since they both refer to a wonderous prophet of the Hebrew God, I don't know how you can assert that the use of the word Saviour inherently implies that Christ WAS indeed a deity.<br />The fact is, for anyone who will not be blinded by their own faith, the novel is excellent, and can be used as a springboard for one's own research.  For those that are too blinded by the 1700 year old veil of Christian &quot;truth&quot; read it for fun, then put it aside.
B000002TPS|5.0|The cd \\"Youthanasia\\" by Megadeth is great. It has a lot of really good songs. I enjoy every single one of them. It starts with a really great opener called \\"Reckoning Day\\". This song has great everything. Great guitars and vocals. I also like the drumming at the end of the song. \\"Train of consequences\\" is the next track and it is  as good as the first track, and it is very great. The next track is \\"Addicted to chaos\\". It is a really great song. \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" is the next rack and it is one of the best songs on the cd. \\"Elysian Fields\\" is next and it is not as good as the others, but it is still good. \\"The killing Road\\" is good, but it isn't that good compared to the rest of the cd. \\"Blood of Heroes\\" is a bit underated. It is a very good song and I like it. \\"Family Tree\\" is another great song.Up next is the title track \\"Youthanasia\\" It is a really good song and it is just as good as the rest. \\"I thought I knew it all\\" is next and it is so great, and it is one of my favorites. Black Curtains\\" is another great song\\". \\"Victory\\" is the last track and it is about their past and just like thier past it is also very good.
B000002I2M|5.0|This album has great, catchy riffs everywhere. It was the last album of their career and Jim was resembling a weathered, bloated Jesus. You can hear the tiredness in his voice and it works great in all the songs. I mean, this is the blues and nothing else really. He should sound beaten down. Every song on here is a classic, great for riding in your car and singing along to, or dimming the lights at the end of the day and just relaxing. It's got the rock epic L.A. Woman, probably the best song they had ever written. This was an extremely high note for the band to go out on, I'd recommend it to anyone ready to get into the Doors.
B000002UUX|5.0|Megadeth is a great band! Rust in Peace is a really awesome cd. It has many great songs, but out of those I would say that my favorite would have to be &quot;Hanger 18&quot; because it is an amazing songs with many great guitar riffs! BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!!
B00005JLYW|1.0|Would give this movie zero stars if they let me.  A true cinematic disaster.  Bad plot w/ even worse acting.  The original Angels the ARE NOT!  Most of the reviewers don't know who the original Angels even are.  Bring back Farrah Fawcett, Jacklyn Smith, Kate Jackson, Cheryl Ladd, Shelly Hack, and Tanya Roberts any day.  <br />Thanks for giving us another crap movie ..... Hollywood!<br />As for McG he McSucks!
0893815233|2.0|I viewed this book only once in a store and decided it is not the one for me.  Technically Sally Mann is a fine photographer who is obviously at the top of her game.  Her subject matter had tremendous potential!  But there is one glaring problem: the children do not appear to be enjoying childhood, but appear sad, psychologically disconnected, emotionally abused, rejected, of low self-esteem, unwilling participants as models, and physically battered.  There is even one photo a boy with a broken nose and blood all over his chest.      I have seen my share of children get hurt while playing (I saw one small boy fall from a tree, snapping the bones in his forearm).  What I saw that day was not a moment of artistic inspiration.  Shock value, artistic interpretation of childhood, or whatever the thrust of this book, I cannot see myself ever owning or recommending it.  It is too dark, depressing and menacing.      Personally I think plenty of imaginative artistic themes can be produced with happy children who are not busted up or who appear endangered.      I own a copy of the works of Salvador Dali; his art is certainly disturbing...but not like this.  I can appreciate Dali's art or even Michael Parkes' and Jan Saudek's, but this publication is too real and too chilling, having grown up in an abusive household myself.  I would very much love to see Sally Mann's other works, however, because she is a fine photographer and must surely have a more \\"light-hearted\\" production of children's photos.  If not, then Sally Mann is best left to those who take pleasure in \\"dark\\" art.    I recommend Jock Sturges' work, RADIANT IDENTITIES, instead.  Although it is very similar in many regards, his subjects appear to be willing participants, and he has chosen to display a wide variety of emotions, including happiness.    My complaint is not against the nudity.  After all, we are born that way; it's just the overall negative imagery of this particular work.  It is sad that so many peoplein our society think that to be imaginative and artful you must also be sinister or immoral.  Nudity can be expressed artistically and positively, even with children (remember your own photos of splashing around in the tub or the rubber swimming pool as a toddler?)  Even if it's not all up-beat and chipper it does not have to be so overwhelmingly depressing.

B00005JLT5|5.0|After it was garlanded with awards and so much critical acclaim I decided I had to watch The Pianist, even though with war movies you never know whether you'll get something honest and affecting or trite and clichéd.  Polanski's movie definitely belongs to the former.  Charting the life of the Jewish pianist Szpilman (Brody) against the backdrop of war in Poland it's a powerfully emotional piece that, once you've seen the end especially, makes it well worth sitting down for two and a half hours to watch.  Interestingly, rather than show us a view of the Polish resistance or an inside view of the harrowing concentration camps, this is all about one man, and all the better for it.  The Pianist achieves a kind of intimacy with its subject that other similar films cannot boast.<br />Beginning with the bombing of the radio station where Szpilman plays to Polish listeners, his family are rapidly dispatched to the Jewish ghetto.  I've heard a few reviews stating that the parts of the movie involving Szpilman's family life are clichéd.  In a way this is easy to see, with stereotypes being made of various figures such as the brother who refuses to be put down, the valiant sister and the elderly father being used for the sympathy vote.  However, the movie is told in such a brilliant manner that you forget all of these clichés (especially since it's based on a true story).  There are some scenes that are very difficult to watch - people being shot point blank or tossed from windows - but it's this kind of emotional intensity that make it all the more worthwhile.  It was certainly a wise choice to stay out of the concentration camps, in part because the looks on the faces of the Jews being herded into cattle trucks to be sent to their deaths is enough to affect any viewer, and also because it might have been too harrowing for the viewers.  Significantly, it is when Szpilman is alone in the bombed down city streets of Warsaw that the movie really scales down to the intimate and where Brody's performance stands alone as one of true excellence.  Admitedly these parts can get a little slow, but they're worthwhile for the conclusion, which couldn't have come about without these parts and it's certainly brave of Polanski (and typical) for him not to flinch at any part of Szpilman's memoirs.<br />The final moments though, are just sublime.  Starving in an abandoned house Szpilman is finally discovered by a sympathetic German officer, and these scenes really burn a deep impression into your memory.  Acted with humiliation and sense of what's lost, culminating (inevitably) in Szpilman's uplifting/depressing performance of Chopin, it's the emotional core of the movie.  Put simpy, this deserved every award it won, and then some.

B00009NHC5|4.0|Audrey Hepburn as Susy Hendrix, a blind wife to a photographer, unknowingly ends up with a doll stuffed with drugs in her basement apartment.  The story becomes highly suspenseful as criminals attempt to retrieve the doll at all costs.  Audrey Hepburn performs brilliantly and convincingly as the blind wife who must face her handicap as well as the hardened villains.  At the end, Wait Until Dark offers a strong cinematic experience.

B00004YX39|5.0|Just like \\"The Royal Scam\\" was the darker predecessor of the already-grim \\"Katy Lied,\\" likewise \\"Gaucho\\" is the darker sister of \\"Aja.\\" The last album from the first lifespan of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen (better known as the sardonic Steely Dan), \\"Gaucho\\" was released a long three years after the stunning success of \\"Aja\\" (which is still hailed by many to be their masterpiece). Several factors contributed to this long interval, but most notably was a contractual dispute between MCA (ABC) and Warner Brothers, with whom Steely Dan had signed a new contract. The battle wouldn't end even when MCA won the rights to the new album, as Becker and Fagen fought (to no avail) to stop a price increase for their new record.<br />Nonetheless, when it was finally released, \\"Gaucho\\" gave fans the dose of Dan that they'd been craving for three years. Not surprisingly, a lot of the album's content was substantially more sardonic than that of \\"Aja.\\" The former album had been just slightly less pessimistic than their previous works; for instance there was the brightness of 'Peg,' and the care-free 'Josie' (the doomsday feeling was echoed best through 'Deacon Blues'). But with \\"Gaucho,\\" Becker and Fagen had convinced themselves that they had already spent their musical zenith, which understandably made the creation of this album a daunting task. The familiar pessimism of old times was the result, but here it was finally matched with the perfectionist gloss of studio sterility that had made \\"Aja\\" such a hit; examples being the death knells of \\"illegal fun under the sun\\" in 'Glamour Profession,' the paranoia of the title track and 'My Rival,' and the irnoy of 'Third World Man.' Some moments do resemble \\"Aja\\" to a T; 'Babylon Sisters,' 'Time Out Of Mind,' and 'Hey Nineteen,' the view of a man who finds himself out of touch with what's new. Still, even these tracks are executed with a weariness that was even more evident within Steely Dan than before.<br />\\"Gaucho\\" would ultimately signal the end for this first era of Steely Dan; Fagen would find solo success with a Top 20 album, and Becker would pursue low-key projects. Of course, the duo re-united by the 90s and would eventually release two more widely acclaimed and popular albums. Knowing this makes \\"Gaucho\\" easier to listen to. If it had been the definite end of Steely Dan, it would be an unsatisfying breaking point, but fortunately for us, it wasn't.the end for this first era of Steely Dan; Fagen would find solo success with a Top 20 album, and Becker would pursue low-key projects.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|IT'S REALLY SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO TYPE HERE WHAT EMOTIONS I FELT THRU OUT THE FILM, ESPECIALLY THE CLIMAX! IT IS FILLED WITH SUCH WONDERFUL HUMOR, SENSITIVITY, AND DEEP LONGING THAT YOU ARE SO MESMERIZED BY IT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO GET UP WHEN IT WAS OVER. THE ACTING BY IT'S TWO WONDERFUL STARS IS MARVELOUS, AND MS. COPPOLA'S UNCANNY DIRECTION LEAVES ONE BREATHLESS! THE GORGEOUS CINEMATOGRAPHY IS WONDERFUL AS WELL. ON DVD THE DTS AUDIO AND PICTURE QUALITY REALLY DO THE FILM A GREAT JUSTICE AS WELL. I HOPE IT WALKS OFF WITH A FEW OF IT'S NOMINATED OSCARS, BUT I STILL WANT LOTR THE RETURN OF THE KING TO GET BEST PICTURE AND DIRECTOR.  LOST IN TRANSLATION IS A BENCHMARK OF HOW A REALLY GREAT FILM SHOULD BE MADE.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This is a must see movie for all action sci fi fans. This movie is up at the top of my list with the matrix. It for sure takes gun fighting to the next level above the matrix. To bad it went straight to video I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen. Everyone i know that has seen this movie movie loved it. One of the best things is it wasn't ruined by any mushy love scenes it's 100% action. I can only hope therewill be a part 2.
0553278223|5.0|Regardless of Bradbury's genre, the essence of his prose is very human. In The Martian Chronicles he manages to deliver that ever bitter/sweet feeling of nostalgia. From Springfield, Illinois in his coming of age novel, Dandelion Wine, to a front porch on Mars, Bradbury always touches the human heart. This is why this novel is great; whether on a distant planet or not, you will be moved.
6305508550|5.0|The premise of this film is very weak, that of a guy who finally sees the light and decides to &quot;not go anymore&quot; to his dead end job. The true merit of it lies in showing almost every possible office situation that can happen, while not really exaggerating them.<br />Peter Gibbons (Livingston) works at Initech, a software company like thousands others, in a thankless job checking lines of code for the Y2K glitch. He's numb from all the stupid, meaningless work he and his co-workers, Michael Bolton (no, he's not related to the singer) and Samir Nagheenanajar (&quot;No one in this country can ever pronounce my name right!&quot;), have to do. He has the &uuml;ber boss, Lumbergh (Cole) who makes him work saturdays and who pays very little attention to what Peter says or does. There's also Joanna (Aniston), the waitress from Chotchkie's, the restaurant next door who Peter secretly likes, but has never had the guts to talk to. There's even the consultants, Bob and Bob, who are downsizing the company.<br />Office space is a really fun movie and has gained a little bit of a cult following (especially Gary Cole's character). It also has a great soundtrack, with very clever use of some rap songs. The acting is pretty good, very natural and simple, which goes well with the simple storyline. This is a fine film to own, you'll watch it many times over the years!<br />The movie was based on characters created by Judge (Beavis &amp; Butthead) for a cartoon that used to play on Saturday Night Live, called Milton, for Stephen Root's character, a mousy, mumbling man who works at the office. Judge also makes a cameo of sorts, playing Stan, the manager at the restaurant where Aniston's character works. Also of notice, The Drew Carey Show's Diedrich Bader appears as Lawrence, Peter's next door neighbor and Orlando Jones does a cameo as a magazine subscription salesman.
B000001ELP|5.0|Following the departure of Peter Criss and the watered down but still rhythmic Unmasked album, the quartet came out with this concept album about a boy on a quest to defeat some evil power from taking over the universe.  It worked for Pink Floyd and twice for the Who, so why not KISS?  True, their use of the American Symphony Orchestra may have angered fans, but Ace's guitarwork, Gene's demonic voice, and new drummer Eric Carr's drums really support the album.<br />After a horns and symphonic fanfare heralding the beginning of the tale, we get the first ballad, of the uncertain chosen one:  &quot;if hope are lost than so are we/well, some are searching for one to guide us/some are staring at me/But I'm no hero, though I wish I could be.&quot;  Paul's falsetto works well here, as does Ace's guitarwork.<br />That segues into one of my favourites, a romantic piano and strings ballad &quot;Odyssey&quot; detailing the voyage the boy goes through, across the galaxy, through the realms of time and space.<br />I can imagine some wags thinking &quot;we're notes in the music searching for a remembered rhyme&quot; as equating KISS's career at this point.<br />The mid-paced number &quot;Only You&quot; reaffirms the boy as the chosen saviour, the one with the answers, and with connotations of a Messiah being:  &quot;you are the light and you are the way.&quot;  Blonde Teutonic metal goddess Doro Pesch later covered this on her self-titled album.<br />In &quot;Under The Rose&quot;, the boy seems to be going under some testing or initiation.  The chorus's basso operatic voices in unison add to the hallowed atmosphere of this number.<br />Ace was disillusioned at the direction KISS's music was taking so he only contributed lead vocals to the more rocking &quot;Dark Light,&quot; and his virtuoso guitarwork clearly shows the heavier direction he was aiming for.  The solo is just as worthy as his one in the live version of &quot;Shock Me&quot; on Alive II.  This song has the darkness and power of the evil force descending.<br />Yet another symphony-enhanced ballad and favourite, the Gene-sung &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot; is something many of us seem to be living in:  &quot;in a world without dreams, things are no more than they seem/a world without heroes, is like a bird without wings/like a bell that never rings/a sad and useless thing.&quot;<br />&quot;The Oath&quot; is the second heaviest song here, and thanks to Ace's guitar and Eric's drums, could enhance Destroyer or Love Gun.  After the slow and chugging &quot;Mr. Blackwell&quot; about the villain of this album, the racing metal instrumental &quot;Escape From The Island&quot; courtesy of Ace.  A definite candidate for Rock And Roll Over, and it'd be cool to hear this track live on a future collection.<br />&quot;I&quot; has the boy ready to begin the fight as the chosen one after realizing his strengths.  Some of the Star Wars mythos comes in: &quot;I believe in something more than you can understand/I believe in me.  Another hard rocker sung by Paul and Gene.<br />It's interesting to see KISS returning to Bob Ezrin, who produced their hit album Destroyer, and three of the songs, &quot;Dark Light&quot;, &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Blackwell&quot; had Lou Reed, listed as Lewis Reed, contributing.<br />The remastered version has the songs in presumably the original order, and hearing them that way, the story makes more sense.  If one wants to reduplicate the way it was on the initial CD release, here is the sequence:  8,1,2,4,6,7,5,9,10,3,11.<br />In retrospect, The Elder isn't as pathetic as deemed by KISS fans.  Those who only see KISS as the group of Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, or Lick It Up and Animalize, are being rather short-sighted.  KISS's transition period beginning with the solo albums, leading into Dynasty and to Creatures Of The Night, was crucial to their development, as they try new things, at times I wonder if they daringly thought, &quot;Let'spretend we're not KISS.&quot;  The best album in their transition period.retend we're not KISS.&quot;  The best album in their transition period.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|Compilations. These are probably the most discussed CDs. When picking up the songs that are going to be part of an artist's collection of greatest hits (or misses), a lot of issues come into play; where the songs released as singles? Did they do well in the charts? Do fans ask for them at concerts? Who has the rights to these songs? Does the artist like this song better, or that one? Does the label want to add a certain song for some reason? How many new tracks should be included? And the list goes on and on, ad nauseam.<br />HIT, the new Peter Gabriel's collection (the definitive one, if you believe the cover) decidedly asked some of those questions. The most obvious, er, *flaw* that this set has is the lack of songs from PG's second album (Scratch), which is one of the favorite albums of die hard fans (m'self included, thankyouverymuch). The songs from that CD have continuously escaped PG's compilations, except for Revisited, which basically was made up of songs from his 'early' solo career. Although I would have liked to have some of the tracks from that CD here (like On the air and A wonderful day in a one-way world), I understand that there must be a reason for their absence - Peter is very (VERY) fan oriented, so he must have had his reasons.<br />Another 'problem' with collections such as this one is that it is completely and totally impossible to please everyone. If  you read other reviews, you'll find people saying that this track or that track should be included, or complaining that they did include another one that shouldn't be here. Hey, we all have different tastes and different reasons as to why we like PG's songs (if you asked me, I'd say I would have added Mercy Street, although So has probably enough presence here with 5 songs).<br />If you can put aside these gripes, you'll find that this is an excellent collection that includes some amazing music: Red Rain, Sledgehammer, Biko, Solsbury Hill, Shock the Monkey, Big Time, Family Snapshot, Games without Frontiers and a whole bunch of others. HIT alone is a great CD, but it's also great to have MISS, the second CD that includes tracks that are not as famous or harder to find, like Father, Son, Lovetown and Cloudless. It's a great way for new fans to get to know PG's music. Peter's career as a solo recording artist has produced very little output in the last years (hey, he's busy doing other stuff equally as important, so I'm not complaining) so this second CD has more of the 'newer' songs.<br />There's also an added bonus in this collection. By having this CD you can access tracks from NOODLE ([...] Check it out, it's fun.<br />This is an amazing collection that fans old and new can enjoy, and a reminder that Peter Gabriel is one of the best musicians out there.

B0000508U6|5.0|I first got this CD thinking that my favourite song that I heard on the radio which I later found out was (Clocks) was on this CD. Even though I was wrong, I found even more favourite songs after listening to this album! The thing I've learned about Coldplay is that they just don't write a song and then say &quot;lets record&quot; like most bands today do. They actually take time and write close to 50 songs then narrow it down to the best. At times they will put there trash songs on a single which sometimes are actually better than the single themselves! That is why they are considered the best!! SO buy this album if you haven't gotten to it yet and Enjoy!! Buy there Singles too!
B00009ATIX|5.0|Solaris is NOT a film for everybody. There, I said it. Now, knowing that, you must also know that this is a terrific piece of moviemaking that deserves to be viewed by anyone with interest in cinema.<br />Another thing you must know about this film is that, even if it's story takes place in space, it is more drama than science fiction. The basic premise of the movie has sci fi roots, but the story plays out more like drama and even suspense than a space/action flick.<br />George Clooney plays Kelvin, a widower who is called by one of his friends to go to a spaceship orbiting the planet Solaris, because \\"he's the only one who can figure out what's happening\\". Once he arrives there, he finds a desolate ship, it's only surviving crew made up of creepy Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis). After his first night there, Kelvin experiences first hand what Solaris does to people, as his dead wife (Natascha McElhone) suddenly appears by his side. The rest of the film follows Kelvin as he tries to understand what's going on. Is this really his wife or is it something else? Is he dreaming or is this really happening?<br />The pace of the movie is rather slow, and the acting is quite controlled (for lack of a better word). The sets are amazing, with a retro-futuristic look and some of the camera placements give very interesting takes. The special effects are very wisely used here. As stated before, this is not an action movie, but it is placed in space and there's plenty of takes of a few spaceships and of the planet itself (very nice looking, by the way).<br />If there's another thing you should know is that the movie was written and directed by Steven Soderbergh, a man who was nominated for Best Director twice in the same year (Erin Brockovich and Traffic) and actually won one of them, and produced by James Cameron, the same guy who wrote, produced, directed and edited the highest grossing movie of all time, Titanic. This is a very interesting coupling, and I promise you the commentary track on the DVD is not to be missed.<br />To conclude, this movie is a remake of the 1972 russian film (Solyaris) based on Stanislav Lem's book.mise you the commentary track on the DVD is not to be missed. <br />To conclude, this movie is a remake of the 1972 russian film (Solyaris) based on Stanislav Lem's book.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Coldplay is one of the great bands of its time. First, looking at the DVD I was amazed by the filming job, the great colours and effects. It was filmed very well and you can even get different angles on your remote control which I found to be brilliant!! Also includes a great new song called &quot;Moses&quot;! The DVD also includes lyrics and websites to got as well as Coldplay's tour diary which I found great as well. It was all very interesting and fascinating to watch what they did before gigs and such. Bottom line is that both the DVD and CD Have a GREAT quality of sound!! One other interesting fact is how many places and gigs they did. They only show a few bits of a couple of gigs on the DVD and then the whole show from Sydney but they show you a map or a &quot;web&quot; they made of the gigs they did and I ask myself how they could they find time to rest considering it looks like they did hundreds of them! You WILL be VERY Pleased with this!!!
B0001906O0|5.0|I got into the Cure in 1988 and tried to collect as many B-Sides that were released before '88 and started collecting each one that was released from '88 and on. This completely satisfy's the void I've had for 16 years trying to find the ones that we're too hard to get! Plus it's nice to hear all the singles that were on the B-Side of the &quot;Standing on the Beach&quot; tape digitally remastered. I only wish that it contained &quot;Carnage Visors.&quot; But I'm sure that will be released later as I heard Robert and Co. are re-releasing each studio CD digitally remastered with bonus material.<br />Nonetheless, it is almost ineffable to describe how thoroughly enjoyable it is to listen to each disc.
B0000248L0|3.0|Annihilator was a metal band lead by guitar virtuoso Jeff Waters. He wrote or co-wrote every track on this album and proves a very creative, intelligent lyricist.  Waters took a lot of care in these songs and even includes the stories behind the songs.  Some examples: the title track is about a girl confined to a room by a fanatically overprotective grandmother after the girl looked at a boy in a grocery store; \\"Sixes and Sevens\\" comes from the British phrase for disorder; \\"Road to Ruin\\" is about a drunk driver (\\"impaired security at ninety miles an hour\\"); \\"Kraf Dinner\\" is about just what the title states without risking copyright infringes (\\"a cheddar cheese heart attack\\"); \\"Stonewall\\" was written after Waters moved to Vancouver and discovered the depressing reality of chemical damage to a river.  <br />The music is also very creative.  The guitar in \\"Never, Neverland\\" (not affiliated with Michael Jackson's estate) is beautiful (not unlike \\"Crystal Ann\\" from their debut album) and it incorporates a story-telling vocal.  Things get silly, though, when they get to the defensive part: \\"Get back, back! Just leave us all alone! Take that and that! I'll break your every bone!\\" (can you imagine a little girl yelling this?).  Some of the songs are preachy, especially \\"Stonewall\\" (\\"the power of corporations, spewing chemicals into the air. Fines are imposed to discourage, but what's a dime to a millionaire.\\") Still, the album rocks with, of course, excellent guitar. The music gets more thrash in the last tracks, although I find the first half of the album to be more interesting.  It is also more solid than their previous album Alice in Hell.
0553277472|3.0|Hehe, get the pun in the title there?  Riding...writing...no takers?  Eh, I thought it was clever, anyway.<br />You know, reviews on this book tend to sort themselves into two camps, the five stars and the one stars.  G'head, look, I'll wait.<br />Back?  Well I gave it three stars.  Yeah yeah, I know, &quot;just to be different&quot;.  Actually, the score isn't what I personally had in mind; I wanted a 5i to keep with the whole theme of reevaluation of standards (5i would be an imaginary number, for all you non-math majors), but a regular three stars is all I can get away with.<br />The problem I've got is that neither camp seems to understand the underlying point.  Those that hate it tend to attack some of the pointedly irrational reasoning as an intellectual cop-out, and then go about logically deconstructing his argument by showing his dialectic errors and yada yada yada.  Yes, he makes a logically unsound argument; Pirsig comes right out and says it, and that may very well be a cop-out.  But which is worse, the philosopher who retreats into these illogical defenses or his attackers who don't have the balls to follow him and defeat him on his own ground?  The way to effectively win a debate is to turn your opponent's argument back upon itself, not to run back to your own incomplete abstractions.  Example:  don't use words like &quot;substantive&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; (which Pirsig goes to great pains to redefine) and apply the Webster's definition to them.  It's just weak.  Someone in one such review said on the dichotomy of subjective and objective that &quot;there is in fact only one, the objective; the subjective refers to the fact that we can only see one portion of the objective universe.&quot;  First, even in traditional definitions of these terms, this is NOT true.  Just go to a crazy house, or better yet, just pay attention the next time you're dreaming; the subjective is EVERYTHING.  If it wasn't, you wouldn't be on Amazon writing an opinion because there would be no opinion, only objectivity.  Duh.  Kant knew this, Freud knew this, and so did everyone before and after them.  Second, the very argument proposed is a redefinition of these terms; to go back to the old definitions is to simply miss the point--in other words, language like this basically reduces everything else you've said to absolutely nil.<br />Now for the five star camp...oh God.  &quot;It really changed my life&quot;, &quot;it really had an effect on me&quot;, &quot;it really breaks down the system&quot;, &quot;it's really original&quot;...what did it REALLY do?  Honestly, tell me, I'm dying to hear, because the fact of the matter is that most of the stuff contained in the book is derivative.  Some people get the credit that they deserve, like Poincare and Thoreau (and if this isn't a sequel to Walden, I don't know what else it could be).  However, the most influential thinkers don't.  Nietszche broke down the subject/object dichotomy a LONG time ago and in just this fashion, and even took it a step further; he proposed an entire restructuring not just of thought but of grammar.  If the divisions between subject and object are artificial, then so are subject and predicate; therefore, as the subject and object are actually one in the same perceptively, then the subject should not be seperated from the actions he/she/it performs--indeed, those predicate actions are what DEFINES the subject, not the other way around.  To make my point, get off the soap-box.  You honestly do more to make people shy away than to win any converts.  I've read little in this book that is actually original, except maybe the part about a man riding his motorcycle.  Now THAT is creative.<br />But for me...sure, I like it.  It's been a great read, and the unification of Eastern and Western thought is especially provocative.  And whether you like it or not, the fact is that technology has, in some way, caused an alienation in the 20th century in the consumer; Pirsig thought he had an answer, and here it is.  Maybe he's wrong, but at least it's a start, and not a wholly bad one either.  It's the first time that many concepts (like Zen and Bhudda) have been explained to me in terms that made concrete, relative sense, not just mystic mumbo-jumbo.  It tends towards density and boredom sometimes, but I believe Pirsig has a point for this.  He invokes Thoreau, who used an extremely similar technique, early on, and in one of my favorite parts elucidates in a VERY tedious manner the various equipment he takes with him on the road, and I couldn't help but be reminded of Thoreau's bean-planting ventures in Walden (especially since Pirsig mentions how boring Thoreau can be right after he's gone on about his knapsack for 5 pages; it's called tongue-in-cheek humor).  On the whole, though...just too idealistic, yet again just like Thoreau.  But read it for yourself--I do highly recommend it regardless of it's shortcomings--and make your own decision; that's the whole point, not to hear my rant or rave on it.<br />One final point to make to the detractors.  *IF* you're going to argue against this book, it's so simple to do that you look like a moron for not doing it.  Pirsig says Quality is self-evident, right?  And you say that you don't like the book, right?  And an understood point that he makes is that Quality is present in this book.  Well by God, then that Quality hasn't made itself self-evident, therefore it isn't present to defend itself, and therefore Pirsig's argument is in ruins.  See how easy that was?
B000002IGP|5.0|Out of the Cellar is one of my favorite &quot;metal&quot; albums of the 1980s.  Almost everybody has heard their smash hit &quot;Round and Round&quot; (one of the best singles of the decade) and, if you love that song (and who doesn't?) this album is for you.  Every track has the same intensity, awesome guitar solos, and catchy melodies.  The trite lyrics about crime and women are completely blown away by the heavy, guitar-driven Ratt sound and Stephen Pearcy's unmistakable vocals.  Every song rocks but, besides &quot;Round and Round,&quot; my favorite is &quot;Lack of Communication.&quot;  It has a killer bridge.  Out of the Cellar is a classic early 1980s metal record when metal was fun...and, oh yeah, rocked! If you just have &quot;Round and Round&quot; on a compilation CD and do not have Out of the Cellar, buy it now!  It will not disappoint.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is by far the best television series ever.  I was so sad that I cried when I found out that it was cancelled.  I am very happy to find out that a movie is in the making ... ahhh if only it were to be brought back to the television screen but alas I think that will never happen.  Why is it that the great shows always get cancelled without even being given a chance.  Please please please please buy this dvd set.  Show Joss Whedon how much you love this set and how big his fan base is.  Maybe, just maybe, he will find a way to bring the show back !
0316666343|1.0|Sebold's number one bestseller The Lovely Bones starts promisingly as the reader expects a thrilling criminal story after the first couple of pages. But it finally becomes a soppy catastrophe with a predictable happy-ending. <BR>Susie, the protagonist, is murdered by a crazy dollhouse-making neighbour, who is the most interesting character in the book. She tells the story from heaven and describes what's happening on earth. But the only things she talks about are the boring, emotional and calculating developments of her family and friends e.g. an irrelevant and adolescent relationship between her sister Lindsey and her boyfriend Samuel, her mother's senseless escape from the family and her midlife-crises combined with her affair (of course!) with detective Len Fenerman who tries to solve Susie's murder and finally the father's heart attack hence the mother (who would have expected this?!) returns to her family. <BR>The plot is long-winded as the story doesn't have a real climax. Furthermore Sebold puts tons of stereotypical characters (like Ruth, \\"the loner\\") and clichs into her novel.  All in all I was very disappointed and I wondered why this emotional rubbish was on the bestseller lists for such a long time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I had not a clue what I was watching when I went to the theater with some friends to see this.  I'm not particualarly interested in musicals, but from the first song to the closer, I was hooked.  The movie was so origional.  Never before have I seen murder and sleazy lawyers glorified in such a brilliant manner!  I loved the lights and the songs (especially the dummy scene) and I couldn't believe that I was singing along.  This movie was so entertaining. Pure genius.<br />P.S. To the girl complaining that there is too much singing:  Why do you think they called this a MUSICAL???

0064407667|1.0|I must say after having made myself stomach the first 3 I just had to chuck the 4th right out the window in mid-read. While I must admit that the first book had it's own original plot and was entertaining enough, the rest of the books seemed to have the exact same plot with a few certain character name changes. All that seemed to happen was: the children went to a new relative (whether they got on with the relative or not seemed irrelavent), Count Olaf followed them and disguised himself and had yet another \\"ingenious\\" plot to take the children's inheritence, he was folied, for some reason or another the children had to leave their newest gaurdian and find another. Perhaps Snicket came up with new plots to follow the rest of the books however, I just couldn't take anymore. As for Snicket's continual interruptance of the story to \\"warn the reader\\" of the unfortunate events coming up, while it was cute and even creative at first it got old and rather annoying very quickly to the point where I felt like tearing out those specific pages. I can not see how people equate these books with the likes of Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, His Dark Materials, The Chronicles of Narnia, etc, which are obviously on a much higher level.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The \\"de-spectorization\\" is nice, but it's the superb sound quality that nails it for me.  This one is a definite must-have for any true Beatles fan. I have compared it track by track with the original released versions, and trust me, there IS no comparison. \\"Get Back\\" from the original \\"Let It Be\\" and from \\"Past Masters II\\" sounds so muddy, but this one is crystal clear. Ringo's cymbals and Paul's vocal couldn't sound better. John's acoustic guitar is so powerful on \\"Across The Universe\\" and the fade-out at the end is simply marvelous. It has an eerie feeling to it.  Maybe with the advent of DVD-A's and SACD's, the remastering and remixing of the Beatles' entire catalog is just around the corner. I only hope and pray that whenever EMI, Paul, Ringo, Yoko, Olivia and whomever else signs on the dotted line, they go with the same team that produced this CD.  [...]  BTW, the bonus disc and the booklet are both third-rate. But, who cares?! The \\"Naked\\" disc is simply FABulous!!
0316666343|4.0|The book The Lovely Bones has given me a whole new look on death and the experience you feel after losing someone in your life. I now feel as though more than ever, that those who have passed on are watching out for us in the higher place. I really liked the book and could relate to and feel for many of the characters. I feel like I have met people who express those emotions just like the characters. From the book I learned how people experience different emotions and feeling after they have lost someone they love.  I also learned that people deal with these emotions very differently.
B000006O7C|5.0|Ok. I've read a lot of reviews about this cd set, and a lot of them are not really appropriate. The songs that are piled together on this cd are simply what the band memebers and Buckley's mom found after his death. None of these songs were &quot;ready&quot; to be on any official album by Jeff Buckley. These are unfinished works, and there's really no reason for people to think that these songs are a far cry from Grace. Do your research. This is not mainstream music that is going to grow on people like a couple songs from Grace were. This cd set is for the true fans who &quot;get it&quot;.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam, while the best rock band that ever existed, is not now nor have they ever been Grunge. Just because Eddie wore long untamed hair and a flannel shirt, and just because they came out of Seattle in the early 90's does not mean they were Grunge. Grunge was a specific genre of music that was unique to Nirvana (the best grunge band that ever existed). There is no point in comparing Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Its quite like comparing apple and oranges, literally. That said, this collection is awesome! I am a die hard Pearl Jam fan and I have been for 12 years. I thought there was nothing by them that I had not heard. I was wrong. I would say that about half of the songs on this collection are songs that I never even heard of before. Most are awesome, some are ok, but over all I would still give it 5 stars. I think though, this is a collection for the die hard fan. If you are a casual fan of the band, and only really like Ten and VS, then you'll probably get nothing special out of this, but I love it. I think that it is wonderful. If you love Pearl Jam, this collection of rarities and b-sides is a must have!!
B000002B1M|4.0|In It Was Written, Nas' sophomore album, he does a pretty good job in putting together another very solid album. While every track isn't great like Illmatic, It Was Written is still filled with many very good tracks. Nas' two albums following this fell off greatly from the overall quality of his first two. Nas is still the young and hungry MC on this album that he was on Illmatic and because of that I would still call this a very good album. There were more guest appearances on this album than on Illmatic, but for the most part they were done pretty well and the guests dropped some pretty hot verses.<br />My 3 Favorite Tracks:<br />The Message<BR>Affirmative Action<BR>I Gave You Power
B00003CWL6|5.0|If you haven't already seen American Beauty, and are weary of the now-toxic levels of hype surrounding it, then you may be best served by moving on. Nothing short of watching the movie itself will truly convince you anyway. But let me just reiterate: it is as good as the hype says it is.<BR>First off, let me say how gratified I was that this movie walked away with lots of Oscars. It was like seeing the Good Guys win after a hard-fought battle, and something that happens all-too infrequently. I need only remind readers of the 10-nomination, zero-statue snub of Gangs of New York in 2003 (which I still find incomprehensible) as a reminder of how rare it is that a deserving mainstream hit drama gets an Oscar.<BR>What I find amazing is how affecting this movie is without any truly sympathetic adult characters. Kevin Spacey's Lester goes from downtrodden sod to pedophilic, blackmailing, unemployed, pot-smoking man-child/id. Annette Bening's Carolyn is the materialistic, status-grubbing matron-harpy. Chris Cooper, meanwhile, is the uber-hard-edged stereotypical military-guy, Allison Janney is a ghost, and Scott Bakula and Sam Robards are almost invisible.<BR>All this is true, yet you still root for Spacey's Lester as he cashes in, shapes up and smokes out. We yearn with Bening for something to take her away from the somehow painful numbness that is her life as she knows it. The moral stands taken by Cooper's Colonel Fitts, although wrongheaded in many respects, are the only ones in the film, and as a result make him the somehow-praiseworthy moral center. Add to this Mena Suvari as your local despicable it-girl and Wes Bentley as the voyeuristic drug dealer next door, and what you are left with is Thora Birch as the only true, if disaffected, innocent in the film.<BR>Yet some of the magic of the flm lies not so much in its content, as its comment on its viewers. Just what kind of people are we, to root for a man, even as he blackmails his company, buys drugs from his daughter's boyfriend and dreams about seducing her other best friend, all in the name of \\"finding himself\\"? What does it say about us in that we find him lovable? And in a medium where not walking out and demanding a refund can be classified as acceptance, how much more so is both a huge box office take and multiple Oscars? Yes, this film has truly lived up to the hype of exposing the dark side of suburbia, but the exposure is not on screen, but in our own hearts.<BR>The remainder of this film's magic? That we neither squirmed nor flinched, but instead took it to heart with no questions asked.
B000002MTR|5.0|yo, Bryan, I don't know what You're talking bout man, this album is great, and Dave Navarro fits in perfectly with this band, he shows how his different style can diversify the Chili Peppers.  Look at a song like aeroplane, with great wah effects as well as a great guitar solo to end off the song.  This album is great, I recommend it to anyone who likes cali rock, funk anything of the sort, it's great......
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|... Hey this is a mellow record with catchy tunes, and a smooth flow to it. The melodies are very well done, and it leaves you with a good feeling.. its not a record that you play at full blast.. but you will enjoy very much...
B000008JI1|4.0|This is one of those CDs that if you've not specifically heard all of it, or some of the songs on it, you might not give it a try.  Not sure why this CD wasn't more popular, but could be because of the change in musicians.  Poison hit the rock scene a bit after I began listening to rock music.  I was looking for new sounds that perhaps I didn't give enough credence to in the first place.  This is one of them.  I am, and always will be, a classic rock fan - and in some circles, perhaps this CD will become a classic for Poison.  Although the magic didn't last long with Kotzen leading the way, Native Tongue is in my opinion, the best they did.  My favorite cut is \\"Bastard Son Of A Thousand Blues,\\" which just plain rocks.  If you're not a Poison fan, which I wasn't either, listen to this CD and you might find it more than you imagined Poison being capable of doing.  \\"Theatre Of The Soul\\" will move you too.
B000002C25|5.0|This album is loud and bombastic--this is the album Oasis was bound to make.<br />Even though Noel Gallagher himself hates this album, I think it's an absolutely essential work.  It is heavily underrated and has become the goat in Oasis' catalogue.  Funny, I don't remember it being ripped apart completely in the press, yet it is considered the album that irrevocably changed the band and was met with a bit of a backlash after the massive success of the first two LPs.  Be Here Now also appeared the same summer as Radiohead's OK Computer, and much critical focus shifted from these mad Mancunians to the whiny electronic-fused rock of Thom Yorke and Co.<br />The same way Rattle &amp; Hum is considered the album that humbled U2 (another bit of completely farcical music press nonsense), this is the album that forced change in Oasis.<br />Yet this is a great album.  The wall of sound is massive and dense, packed with fat hooks and the heavy production that Oasis was heading toward.<br />Noel claims that this album was created with a liberal helping of drink and drugs.  I'm not surprised, but since when have these vices stopped great albums from being made?<br />The opening track was the first single and is rock-solid and rousing.  The opening features some electronic, static and sample filled noodling before introducing a big fat beat and a great chorus.<br />So many of the criticisms of this album are true, and yet, I find myself loving the album even more all these years later because of those very perceived flaws.<br />Magic Pie, for instance, is a massive, head-nodding track that goes on about two or three minutes longer than you ever think it will, but that big heavy end jam makes the song for me and gives it an almost irresistible weight.  There are at least three loud and heavy rockers: My Big Mouth, I Hope, I Think, I Know, and It's Gettin' Better (Man!)  They also have big fat hooks and choruses, and the numerous guitars are embedded in a swirling wall of sound, the drums sometimes muddied in the background but definitely there.  Strange that none of these got singles releases.  The biggest single off the album, and the only song Oasis revisit live anymore, is Stand By Me, an excellent stadium anthem.<br />The weakest track is probably Fade In Out, featuring Johnny Depp on guitar(!)  It's a bit flat.  Don't Go Away is similar to Stand By Me, another great, swaying track, a bit melancholy, released as a single in some countries.<br />I think this is the inevitable Oasis album; it's where they were going, and the album they had to make in order to move on and change.  Like their first two albums, it's very consistent in its sound and vision, more so than the two followups.  While Radiohead went on to become the darlings of (largely useless) music critics, Oasis stomped right on.  Highly recommended!the drums sometimes muddied in the background but definitely there.

0780020685|3.0|Having read countless 5 star reviews my expectations before watching this film were very high.  I was disappointed.  Let me say that I enjoyed The Last Samurai so much so that I found this movie by searching for other movies in the genre.  <br />To compare the two is like comparing a 2004 BMW(The Last Samurai) to a 1994 BMW(Seven Samurai), the 1994 was a great car for its time but is no comparison to the newer model.  If Seven Samurai is on anyone's top-ten movie list it is only because they have not seen a movie since 1956.  At times I felt as though I was watching something out of The Three Stooges and not a serious movie.

B00013PHGS|5.0|I fist became aware of AIR when their song SEXY BOY was covered by the Kinky Boyz and used in the first season of Queer As Folk. I bought the CD single first with interesting remixes. Then came the brilliant Moon Safari. Now this must have CD is graced upon us. Suggestive of visuals yet best listened to in the dark. They have carved out their own niche in contemporary music.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I understand that the movie is not nearly comparable to the original Matrix which was one of the greatest Sci-Fi concepts ever presented in a movie, and the first film was in deed superb. The first film changed the world of cinema, but the last two definitely lacked the magic of the first.<br />   But Reloaded and Revolutions are still good. Perhaps they disappointed so many because in deed they didn't deliver the same story quality of the first. Expectations were to high and the result wasn't a master piece like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy case (where each movie delivered something new and exiting - plus a better cast, crew and story connections through the 3 movies by far).<br />   There are both good and bad critics about this one and I'm among the ones that loved it but recognize it has its flaws and not everyone liked it with good reasons. What most people that didn't like it criticized was that the movie left some story arcs unanswered and felt more like a forced sequel.<br />   The movie didn't answer everything with the intention of making us think and give it the interpretation we wish. That's why there are so many interpretations to it, it has so many layers that it would take more than just one good chat to understand all the meanings of the matrix.<br />   This third installment didn't have more kung fu, or philosophical speech than the first two, it rather had more symbolisms throughout not only the actions and reactions of the characters but also through  the concepts used.<br />   Something people should consider is that according to Joel Silver, Reloaded and Revolutions are the same movie cut in half, which gives a different perspective to Revolutions if only analyzed alone. With that in consideration, the movie feels better.<br />   This movie is about an end, death, finding a meaning for life, fighting, truth, etc. But it is not a movie about conclusion. The answers given in Revolutions lead to more questions because in the end it is about believing rather than knowing. After all, if you knew everything, what would be the point?<br />   Revolutions has some incredible special effects scenes and sound. The lightening is quite good along with all the technical aspects of the film. The CGI is better used that in Reloaded, but there was a terrible flaw, the screen felt saturated. I believe this was a mistake of the cinematographer, the camera angles were not right for the massive shots, and things like the sentinels were difficult to follow to the point a feeling of \\"yeah right... I got it, what's next...\\" crossed my mind.<br />   The chemistry between Neo and Trinity is also a little lacking. The mayor story arc is well resolved, but I don't know if it was a matter of the actors or the directors that the chemistry was just missing.<br />   I still give the film 5 star out of the love for the concept introduced by the first film and what I felt was an improvement to Reloaded. The movie has strong points and delivered interesting things... but still lacked the sense of a masterpiece the first had, which disappointed many.<br />The Matrix........................ 10<BR>The Matrix Reloaded........ 7.6<BR>The Matrix Revolutions.... 8.8

0061015725|1.0|You encounter the first F word on page 16.  By page 200 you see 5 or 6 per page sometimes.  I'm not a prude, but I don't use that word, and I resent having to edit it out mentally.  Once or twice is okay, but when it gets in the way of the story, it's time to call a halt.  Which I did at page 225.  Upon further reflection I realized that as the frequency of the word increased so did the deterioration of the plot.  I've heard Mr. Crichton say that he loves research but hates writing.  Apparently his disdain for his craft has reached critical mass.  But I most resent his apparent disdain for his fans.

0385512104|4.0|Explore the mystery of \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" with the fantastic character Christopher John Frances Boone.<br />Review by: William Richards<br />1-27-04<br /> In \\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" author Mark Haddon enables us to enter the mind of Christopher John Frances Boone, an autistic young man, and creates a thought provoking, heart-wrenching mystery novel. Christopher \\"knows all the countries in the world and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7,057\\". Although Christopher excels in \\"maths\\" and logic, he does not understand human emotions.<br />The story opens with Christopher finding the neighbor dog, Wellington, pierced through the middle with a garden fork. The plot begins moving when Christopher decides that he's \\"going to find out who killed Wellington\\". Christopher's careful investigation of who killed Wellington triggers a cascade of events to be unleashed. Christopher tells us that his mother died two years ago of a \\"heart attack\\" and now he only lives with his father. But he discovers through an accident linked to his investigation that his father has been lying to him about his mother' death. It turns out that Christopher's mother couldn't handle the responsibility of raising Christopher and moved away with the neighbor, Mr. Shears. Christopher's father struggles to make Christopher understand why he didn't tell him about his mother. The book reaches the climax when Christopher's father explains that he killed Wellington out of frustration due to a failed relationship with Mrs. Shears. Christopher believes that loving someone is \\"telling them the truth\\", so when his father has been lying to him he decides to embark on a dangerous journey to find his mother in London. (Pg 87).<br /> Haddon writes in the prose of Christopher and does a brilliant job of creating a passage into the mind of an autistic individual. Christopher bounces around from his present investigation to topics ranging from\\"maths\\" problems to his conception of time. Christopher essentially has control of what is written so we are at his mercy when he goes off on numerous tangents. At one point Christopher is looking at a specific cloud and says, \\"And when I looked at it for a long time I could see it moving very slowly and it was like an alien spaceship hundreds of kilometers long, like in Dune or Blake's 7 or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, except that it wasn't made of solid material, it was made of droplets of condensed water vapor, which is what clouds are made of\\". (Pg 68). Christopher's unconventional style of thinking is evident in this passage and the narrative contains many other similar passages in which Christopher explores a vast range of topics. I was intrigued by Christopher's belief that aliens \\"might look like big slugs, or be flat like reflections\\", and their spaceships \\"might look like clouds, or be made up of unconnected objects like dust or leaves\\". (Pg 69). This passage amazed me with its simplistic language but the underlying complexity of the issues addressed and I think Haddon does an excellent job of evoking this feeling throughout the narrative.<br /> Haddon writes in a way that allows us to observe the world through the eyes of an individual that thinks on a completely different plane. Haddon's writing moved me from amusement to intense sadness. I found Christopher's confusion about some of societies norms amusing at times specifically in this passage, \\"[P]eople often say \\"Be quiet\\", but they don't tell you how long to be quiet for. Or you see a sign which says KEEP OF THE GRASS but it should say KEEP OFF THE GRASS AROUND THIS SIGN or KEEP OFF ALL THE GRASS IN THIS PARK because there is lots of grass you are allowed to walk on\\". (Pg 29). I was amused by Christopher's attention to specific details and puzzled at why I had never thought about many of the things that he touches on. Christopher appears to have the answer to that question on page 140 saying \\"But most people are lazy. They never look at anything\\". When explaining what an average person would see in a country landscape he explains how an average person notices a couple details \\"And then they would stop noticing anything because they would be thinking of something else like, \\"Oh, it is very beautiful here,\\" or \\"I'm worried that I might have left the gas cooker on,\\" or \\"I wonder if Julie has given birth yet\\". (Pg 141). Haddon does a fantastic job here contrasting the way Christopher sees the landscape and the way an average person would view the same landscape with Christopher focusing on logistical aspects and \\"others\\" muddled by human tendencies. At times Hadden's writing moved me to sorrow especially when Christopher realizes that his mother is living and that his father lied to him saying, \\"I tried really hard to think if there was any other explanation but I couldn't think of one. And then I couldn't think of anything at all because my brain wasn't working properly\\". (Pg 112). We can't help but feel sorry for Christopher who has been lied to by the only person that is really left in his life and it's difficult to see him to struggle to understand why.<br /> Haddon's original style of writing opens the book up to both adult and young adult readers and would prove a valuable experience for both groups. The narrative is fairly simple, in the prose of Christopher, so many of the younger readers would certainly enjoy the story and unique voice of Christopher. On the same note although the voice of Christopher is simple in prose the issues raised have an intrinsic complexity that would certainly entertain the adult audience. When reading this novel I became enthralled in the life of Christopher and before I knew it I was relating to Christopher and I felt that I had a connection to him. We seem to develop an emotional relationship with Chrisopher, who does not understand emotion, as the narrative progresses and we move from frustration to amusement to excitement that Haddon is able to evoke in the reader. Haddon never tells us in the story that Christopher has autism and we only find out by looking at the front leaflet. We get a feeling in the story that Christopher has about as much sense as any of the other characters, who at times seem to act childish, he just has a \\"different\\" sense.<br /> At times in the book, especially the second half, Haddon appears to become lost in his writing and draws out scenes a little bit. However, these scenes emerge rarely and many times Haddon draws the scenes out to help us gain a heightened understanding of Christopher. Some could argue that Haddon spends too much time on Christopher's rants and not enough time on developing the mystery of the novel. I would counter that the tangents that Christopher embarks on are what makes the story valuable because it helps us to understand Christopher.<br /> Haddon has achieved in crafting a story that will be valuable for generations to come. Humans with disabilities surround us in our everyday lives and gaining an understanding of Christopher in this story may shed some light on how we perceive the disabled. I think Haddon sends a message that the \\"disabled\\" are not that much different from us and they can coexist and contribute valuable perspectives on the world. Christopher is a resonating voice for the disabled and when explaining why he will become a scientist he says, \\"And I know I can because I went to London on my own, and because I solved the mystery of Who Killed Wellington? and I found my mother and I was brave and I wrote a book and that means I can do anything\\". (Pg 221).  Haddon writes this book for no one in particular but the insight that we gain into human disability through the intriguing character of Christopher is universal.

I didn't even sit on the edge of my seat, I stood up and started drumming along with the band. Fantastic !!!

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I love Bill Murray and his deadpan delivery and he is terrific in this film. And Scarlett is very good, too. However I don't understand all the fuss about this film. Yes, I know the characters were bored and lonely and I guess the director wanted us to feel their boredom, too. Well, she did a great job of conveying that feeling because I was bored to tears. The photography was ugly (for some strange reason the photography looked better on TV ads. But in the theatre on a big screen the film looked under exposured with flat colors). You would think since these characters were so bored and lonely they would go out and find something interesting to do. Nope. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting. Is Bill and Scarlett attracted to each other or not? It's not that I wanted them to have some predictable affair I just wanted to understand what was it they found so appealing in each other. Sorry, I wanted to like this film.

B000094J5W|3.0|When I sat down to watch this movie I was in the mood for a great comedy.  I had heard nothing but good things about this movie, I was sadly disappointed. <br />Old School has a great cast that includes Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn.  Luke Wilson's character finds his girlfriend cheating on him with a couple she has met online and decides to leave her.  He moves into a house on campus and his friend played by Vince Vaughn decides have a huge party for him where Will Ferrell's character streaks down the street only to get caught by his wife.  AFter getting caught at the party Will Ferrell's character moves in with Luke Wilson.  After the party the group of friends decides to open a fraternity in his house.   After recruiting several different people for the frat house  many antics end up getting the frat kicked off campus.   <br />There are several twists and turns throughout this movie and yes there are some funny parts but just not as many as I would've liked for a Will Ferrell movie.  I laughed the  hardest when the they were showing the bloopers at the end.
0140288503|5.0|I first heard about somalia when i was way younger than i am now. i remember when my uncle got home from somalia and we had a reunion in tennessee where he lived at the time. i specifically remember this picture that was in the news paper(which we still have) of him giving my little cousin a peck on the cheek right after he got off the plane. anyway i didnt think much of it i didnt even know what somalia was at the time or know anything about the battle. i didnt think of it for a long time untill my mom told me they were making a movie about it called black hawk down and that i should read the book and see the movie. so i bought the book and read it. my uncle wasnt mentioned by name and i dont know what he really did there because he never talks about it. all i know is he was a ranger at the time. but this is an excellent book. it hits me closer to home but it is a good book for anyone to read. if your apprehensive because its nonfiction dont worry about it. it reads just like a fiction novel. it is not boring at all. if you havnt seen the movie yet read the book first. it is way more accurate. anyway just my two cents. excellent book i recommend it for anyone interested in the subject. so BUY IT. READ IT. you wont regret it.
B00004W52U|5.0|Let's keep it simple - one of the best puck albums ever!  I've been listening to this album for who knows how many years and I never get sick of it.  What could have been if they had only stayed together?  Who knows.  But if you only make one album, this was a hell of an album to make.  Way to immortailize yourselves boys.
0553103547|4.0|I've read through some of the critics reviews, I'd like to offer my humble opinion.<br />One critic said that this book wasn't interesting because so many of the characters were neither black nor white in their moral stances.  I think that this kind of moral ambiguity is what makes this series so spectacularly refreshing.  Perhaps this critic enjoys fantasy for the clear heroes and villians, many people do.  On the other hand, most adult readers of fantasy (as well as other genres) are tired of cookie-cutter \\"hero slays dragon riding baddie\\", never swearing, junior high sex reference-loaded, plots and characters.<br />This same critic questions the actions of some of the characters, believing these acts to be a sign of Martin's complete misunderstanding of human nature.  I'm sorry if the critic's morals were offended, but sometimes people can act in ways that are completely and utterly beyond our comprehension.  The depths of human cruelty are bottomless, and I applaud Martin for not shrinking from this fact.  That a tyrant father would have his midget son's (an already constant source of disappointment and pain for the father) wife ... treated the way she was was SHOCKING, but it was not unbelievable.<br />Another critic gave this book one star, seemingly because a couple of the character's names appeared to be too close to a couple of Tolkiens.  We'll never know whether this is intentional or not, but I don't necessarily it's a cardinal sin.  He could just be giving a tip of the hat to the master.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing!  My mom bought it for herself when it came out and i listened to it a couple times, thinking it was alright but not yet being mature enough (i was 10 or 11) to appreciate it.  Recently, I started to listen to it a lot, particularly when doing homework.  What an amazing album is about all I can say.  This review is very hard, because I just can't put into words how great the music on this album is.  But that statement by itself speaks the most you could ask about music:  it is far too great to put into words.  The only way you can express the kind of stuff contained on this album is through music.  There are so many moments on it that just take you away from your current world, and if that kind of thing is enjoyable to you (as it should be if you're not braindead) then you MUST buy this album.  DO IT!  CLICK ON IT NOW!  basically, if you're looking for the best fusion of different moods, textures, beats, sounds, layers, whatever the hell you want, you have to buy this album.  I would say this is an essential album for any rock fan, and it rivals OK Computer.  It solidifies Radiohead's status as the best band of the 1990's, including Nirvana.  Now, Nirvana's Nevermind and In Utero are two of the greatest albums ever, but the fact that Radiohead can go from the amazing song &quot;Creep&quot; to this in a smooth transition, not missing a beat, and go back the other direction with the new album &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; makes them the best band of the 90's, if not one of the best all-time.
B00006JKOL|5.0|Personally I love it.  Have to say Minstrel and Thick as A Brick are my favorite Tull albums.
B000077VR3|5.0|I was initially skeptical about seeing this movie.  It looked like just another love story...and it was.  The story had the herione in distress (played by Nicole Kidman), the meagerly-existing hero (played by Ewan McGregor), the father-figure who tries to control the heroine from behind the scenes (played by Jim Broadbent) and, of course, the manipulative bad guy (played brilliantly by Richard Roxburgh).  But the above quartet was not alone.  This movie features the quirkiest &quot;back-up&quot; cast of characters I think I've ever seen in a movie, headed up by John Leguizamo's nutty gnome Toulouse.  Beyond the great cast of characters was a spectacular, if usually gaudy, set...as well as a rather...inventive...list of musical numbers.  Moulin Rouge takes place at the turn of the 20th century.  The musical numbers are anachronistic.  That is, the majority, if not all, of them are from late 20th century performers like Elton John and Madonna.  Initially, I didn't care for the fusing of late 20th century music with early 20th century motif...but it grew on me and by the second half of the movie I was thoroughly enjoy it.  The only problem I had with the movie was that it seemed to entirely focus on &quot;Inside the Moulin Rouge&quot;.  I realize that this was the performers' life, but surely they went out to buy groceries or something, right?  Overall, despite some initial hesitiation, Moulin Rouge won me over...the movie is definitely worth seeing.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I'm a brand new fan. I first heard Someday on the radio and thought `Where have I been?` So I rushed out and bought it and am trying to get my hands on anything and everything else. What an explosive sound! Every songs offers something unique (for me anyway). Do This Anymore, Feelin' Way Too Damn Good, Figured You Out, and Should've Listened are exceptional. I'm a new fan who's here to stay and rock.
B000006NPY|3.0|Okay, I just want to say that I'm a massive fan of the Pumpkin Smashers ... ha ha. I have every one of their CDs, and to tell the truth, this is not their greatest effort. Their best albums, in my opinion, are Melon Collie, Siamese Dream, and, strangely enough, I suppose, Machina. Do not get me wrong, however - I think this is an impressive CD nonetheless. I've had it since it came out, and I was ten at that point. At the time, being my picky alt-heavy-rock self, I didn't find it a particularily good album. However, over the years I've grown to enjoy it. This is a CD whose entirety is more important than any individual song, and whose atmospherics are more important than heaviness or poppy melodies - and it shows. I don't think there's one hint of distorted power chords anywhere on the album. Instead, Mr. Corgan opted for dark, synthesizer laden soundscapes ridden with depressing, crestfallen lyrics. There is only the occasional hint of optimism; the opening masterpiece &quot;To Sheila&quot; comes to mind, along with &quot;Perfect.&quot; This isn't what you'd call a colourful record - everything seems kind of gray and weathered, despite the polished sound of keyboards throughout. Overall this technique works. There are only two real dissapointing songs on the album, and, strangely enough, they're right beside each other: annie-dog and shame. The first one is unmelodic and goes nowhere, and the second is not very well written. However, the album's last few songs conclude the CD well - the poetic &quot;Nightmare,&quot; as well as the eerie and depressing &quot;Blank Page.&quot; The most amazing song on the album, however, by far, has to go to the second last tune, &quot;For Martha.&quot; Talk about an epic, completely beautiful work of art! It concerns the death of Billy's mother, and has an optimistic but tired tone. The song revolves around piano and jazzy drums, and climaxes in an amazing guitar piece, which is a quick glimpse into the past albums of the Pumpkins.A breathtaking piece on a very good - but not perfect - album.<BR>In conclusion, &quot;Adore&quot; loses points when it comes to catchiness, and the two bad songs I mentioned. The other songs are interesting, and, for the most part, pretty, but they take repeated listening to even start to appreciate. However, if people don't give up on Adore, they will begin to like what they hear. As for souls who want to buy a first Pumpkin CD, I recommend Mellon Collie to you - by far the best album I've ever heard - double OR single. Peace through superior firepower, and rock out!
B00013F35I|5.0|I made the mistake of not purchasing this dvd earlier because of all the sound issues people were talking about.  When I started playing it, there is a difference, I agree.  But the difference does not equate to it being bad.  NYC was very clear, but compared to this, does not capture the real feel of a concert.  I loved NYC, and still do, but for different reasons.  I would not have had this Barcelona DVD any other way.  The sound is FANTASTIC for a concert feel, and why would he want to put out another dvd that sounds the same anyway.  I am from Jersey, and it pains me to say this but, this crowd in Barcelona blew away any crowd of any of the shows in jersey and new york I that have been to over the years.  Fan of him or not, the sound will not have a negative affect.  I loved the sound they had, and think it adds to the concert feeling.  An absolutely great DVD concert.  The energy both on stage, and in the crowd is something that you will be amazed by.  I would have loved to have been there.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I had been hearing for a long time what a brilliant CD &quot;Yoshimi&quot; was, but I resisted giving it a listen for a while due to my dislike of their 90's hit &quot;She Don't Use Jelly&quot;. I'm really glad I gave it a try ... this is an incredible album. The CD starts off strange and subdued, but the emotional impact of the songs gradually builds throughout the album. It climaxes with the gorgeous and hymn-like &quot;Do you Realize&quot;, which, I'm not ashamed to say, brought a tear to my eye. Innocent, psychadelic, beautiful and sincere, I highly recommend this album.

B00005JKNC|1.0|this film, about people who love movies, just may cause you to develop a blind hatred of movies...<br />a genuinely sweet attempt to recapture the Capra-esque spirit is buried somewhere within the glacial expanse of this film, which feels like an all-encompassing bit of fakery...especially in the whole HUAC hearings sub-plot, where the film seems to veer wildly away from realism, toward a desire to tug the audience's heartstrings and reward sentiment......it might not be so creepy if it didn't trivialize the actual McCarthy witchhunts, or if you hadn't seen the truman show. (to those who have, try watching these two movies back to back...there seem to be some eerie parallels..)<br />two bright spots are the Sand Pirates of the Sahara, and Martin Landeau's performance.....his are the only emotions that seem to cut through the stifling atmosphere and ring true-sentimental without being eerily saccarine....
B0001906O0|5.0|I have been a fan of The Cure since 1984 and have hoped this release would see the light of day. It was a blessing when Bob said he would put this together for his fans and he did one heck of a job.... The sound, pictures, booklet, artwork, etc are all top notch quality .... It is what a Cure fan expects from Bob and he delivered again.... Lament(flexipop version), Twilight Garden, Chain Of Flowers, More Than This, and I'm Cold are some of the standout tracks and there are many.....70 tracks in all and the color booklet has 75 pages with great detail about EVERY song in the set( comments from Robert and Simon)....Rare cuts such as Lost Wishes ep, Carnage Visors, Pirate Ships, etc all will be on the 2 cd remaster sets that will be starting in April 2004..... All hail The Cure and bow down at the alter of Mad Bob and his band of mood music makers.... HALLELUJIAH.......
B00005JM20|3.0|This review is not about the movie but the disc...<br />I like Black Adder and Mr. Bean DVDs.  I would have liked this one too but it starts with a bunch of previews (Bring It On, etc) and while it says I am allowed to fast forward through them (but not chapter skip or use the menu button - WHY NOT?) it won't actually let me do that.<br />Having to watch the same previews every single time I put in the DVD is unbearable!
B00012QM8G|4.0|I find myself compelled to take issue with the \\"viewer from San Jose\\", and his/her review titled \\"good movie, bad research\\" dated January 23 2004.<br />While I do not suggest that Mr. Spielberg was 100% spot on regarding the historical accuracies of the film, I believe that this reviewer has completely missed the point. Oskar Schindler was a flawed man, no one will deny that. It is however historical record that that he personally saved some 900 Jewish lives. Mr. Spielberg has simply chosen his story to inform a wide audience of a limited number of events from a period that was probably the lowest point in human history. I guess the reason why he chose Schindler above, say, Rauol Wallenberg, is simply due to the existence of the excellent Novel by Thomas Keneally. <br />(I personally believe that the one real flaw of Schindler's List is to portray a story with an essentially happy ending, but of course this is the problem with almost all holocaust films, since they portray \\"survivor's tales\\". The true horror of the holocaust lies in the stories of the those that did not survive, but conventional wisdom suggests no one would pay money to sit through a film that depressing, and they are probably right)<br />While the reviewer is correct to point out that tens of millions of other people were killed during the Second World War, comparing 20 million Russians and 8 million Germans dying as the consequence of the war, mainly through fighting and starvationas a result of war, to the industrialized wholesale slaughter of the Jews is misleading. Hilter set his sights on one particular people above all; the Jews. At the end of the war, cattle trains transporting Jews to the gas chambers were given priority above trains transporting troops and supplies to the front lines. The entire War finally boiled down to a psychopathic desire to rid Europe of Jews once and for all. (lets not forget that had the Nazis succeeded in North Africa, the same fate would have awaited Jews there).<BR>As for the 5 million Poles he mentions, 3 million of them were Jews for crying out loud. A typically misleading statistic commonly used by Holocaust deniers.<br />Now, for the reviewer's suggestion that Poland was full of people trying to help the Jews, the only reason why Poles make up a large proportion of the list of \\"righteous gentiles\\" is because half of the Jews in Europe happenned to live in Poland. They were therefore afforded far more opportunities to save Jews than any other nation. Why does the reviewer think that the camps were located in Poland? The reason is twofold - firstly, it was logistically the closest location to the largest Jewsish population, secondly, it was well known that Poles would tolerate the camps since they were among the most anti semitic people in Europe. A non Jewish friend of mine while visitng the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem (Yad Vashem) upon viewing the 13000 names of the \\"righteous gentiles\\" commented that there should in fact be millions of them, that every European should have tried to save Jews. It should be the rule, rather than the exception, shouldn't it?<br />As for the reviewer's comments of the brutality of the Jewish police, this purely and simply an indication of being influenced by Holocaust deniers. While I will not deny that these people did not act in a despicable manner by cooperating with the Nazis (they did this out of a sense of self preservation mostly) it is ridiculous to suggest that they were as evil as the murderers of the SS. There are no stories (except perhaps concosted lies) about \\"Judenrat\\" stomping on pregnant women's stomachs or shooting children in front of their parents. And to complain that Schindler's List is too focused on the Jews is like complaining that 9-11 documentaries and books are too focused on American losses when there were dozens of other nationals that died.<br />In the end, the most important point about this film is that it has drawn the attention of many people to the most shameful event in history. To paraphrase a character from the last Woody Allen film, if the punishment for the occurence of the holocaust would be the ceasation of mankind's continued existence, it could be argued that this punishment would be deserved and fair.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|I appreciate that comparing this album to London Calling is a bold statement, perhaps a bit exaggerated, but I can't remember the last time I bought an album and then listened to it around 20 times....within 24 hours.<br />This album is that good, with incredible variety.  Several of the songs harken back to the reggae-rock days of London Calling while others break it down to the simplest form with just Joe and an acoustic guitar (to cover Marley's Redemption Song).  The rest of the tracks are somewhere in the middle, with funky grooves or ballsy riffs.<br />Speaking of Redemption Song, this version is most impressive because Joe doesn't exactly have a &quot;good&quot; voice.  By that I mean someone who you'd consider a &quot;crooner&quot;.  However, his voice works so well here - you can almost feel the anguish in his voice that he got the hard way by living a hard life.<br />There are other tracks on this album that are simply gorgeous in their anthems and near-orchestral arrangements.  I never thought I'd say that about a Joe Strummer tune, but man it's great stuff.<br />My only complaint about this album....with only 10 tracks, you simply want to hear more.  Maybe that's why I've been playing it over and over again.<br />Joe Strummer was an icon of rock and roll and his legacy is left well intact, both as a solo musician and as a member of what was arguably the most influential band in rock history.  Think about it for a second.  If you could travel back in time to see any three bands perform live, how could you not pick the Clash as one of those three?<br />ebhp
B00003CXTG|4.0|I wasn't born yet the first time our country was attacked. So I learned about Pearl Harbor and WW II as I grew up from my family and school teachers. As I got older I learned more about the war and the attack on Hawaii. Each time I saw various documentaries or movies that included the attack it amazed me that we were caught with our pants down so long ago. AND just a few months ago a similar event took place in my home state.<br />BUT I saw all the news clips and film trailers about &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and I waited to see the movie for myself. Having seen &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in the movies the first time it came out I chose to wait for &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; to come on video to see it.<br />Ben Afleck and Josh Harnett portrayed the two young men who became pilots just in time for the war. They also vied for the affections of a nurse played by Kate Beckinsale. While the beginning of the movie was a bit slow it picked up when they were sent overseas.<br />However-when the actual attack on Pearl Harbor started I was startled. Even though I knew it was going to happen, watching and hearing it was entirely different. The cinematography was amazing. Whether it was from the air or the ground, from the land or the sea, each bomb, each torpedo, each explosion showed me what it must have been like that awful morning.<br />Cuba Gooding Jr made another good appearance in this film. Portraying a cook who went topside during the bombing and armed a machine gun-something he wasn't really allowed to do because he was black. Jon Voight made a brief appearance as President Franklin D Roosevelt.<br />I look forward to watching the movie again when I can sit in one place to watch it from end to end. Yes even though I had rented the video I still wasn't able to watch it all in one sitting. But I would recommend this film also.
0743510011|5.0|Just as location is the typical criteria for getting a great deal in real estate that honors the reason it has value, information is the typical criteria for getting a great deal in most other areas that honors the motive behind the value perceived as worthy, or worth choosing. Without sufficient information, most decisions are risky at best, and highly risky at their worst. Gaps in information nearly always produce the worst returns, and impede progress in negotiations of anything. Winning attitudes are rarely adequate to turn information gaps into wins, but often make the information gathering process into spectacular wins. Since no's are nearly always aggravating, clearing the paths to yes are critical to good negotiating, and by far, offer the most logical and reasonable blueprint for success. A great lesson in life important to everyone!
0679805273|3.0|It's not that great. Before purchasing this for my little one I read tons of positive, five star reviews, but I have a hard time ranking this with more than two.<br />It's definitely cleverly written and cute, but not half as good as I expected, it can even be unsettling in certain parts, like when frightening places are mentioned.<br />It is not that appealing and nothing like the Dr. Seuss books I remember growing up.<br />I must also say that I find it over-priced, there aren't that many pages and the illustrations are pretty blah.<br />Can I just say that I found it down right boring?
B00008J4P5|5.0|When I first heard the White Stripes on the radio a few years back, I wasn't a really big fan. But after the hearing the brilliant single &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, I went and got this album. And am I glad I did.<BR>This rock 'n' roll as it was meant to be played. Melodic, smart, funny and most of all, rocking like a mofo. There are fourteen tracks on this record, and all fourteen are well constructed, simple rock songs that beg you to to be played loud on your stereo.<BR>Stand out tracks include &quot;I Want To Be The Warm Your Mothers Heart, &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot;, &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;. But thats not to say that theres a bad song on here, because there isn't.<BR>&quot;Elelphant&quot; is the best rock record I have heard in years, and has even inspired me to get their back catalog(and by God its all pretty good too!). I'm willing tob et that you will really like this record also. VIVA LA ROCK!
B000068TPN|5.0|Knowing some of the people involved with this true story and having met General Harold Moore and Joe Galloway a few years ago I felt a necessity to see the film as soon as possible (ASAP). I had read their co-authored book We Were Soldiers Once and Young so I already knew what to expect of the film. I knew that neither he nor Joe wanted just any Hollywood company to turn their book into a fiasco. They wanted the truth told and shown so Americans could learn about one particular unit and the major battle they fought in 1965. I knew that Mel Gibson was at Fort Benning, Georgia (GA) preparing to make the film. I also knew that they moved the film crew out to Fort Hunter-Liggett in California for the actual battle scenes. I was aware that the producer, director, screenplay writer and company involved with making the movie had also done &#34;Braveheart&#34; which won five Academy Awards a few years ago. I felt they would stick to reality rather than sugar coating the true story. While some things were changed to make the movie from the book most of it was as real as possible. The movie began by showing French soldiers being massacred in June 1954 in the IaDrang Valley by the North Vietnamese. This valley became known as the Valley of Death and was often compared to GEN Custer's battle at the Little Big Horn. This was the first intense battle scene of the film but it was far from being the last. Although this film was about the IaDrang Valley battle of November 1965 it also showed the public much more. It gave you the opportunity to meet certain characters up close and personal. It shows the wives, families, how they were affected and how these women helped each other during this time in history as well as their spouses and children. On Sunday 14 November 1965 the 1/7, made up of about 400 US soldiers, arrived at Landing Zone (LZ) Xray and soon found themselves up against more than 2000 North Vietnamese Army (NVA) soldiers. For the next three days the soldiers battled theenemy. Precise times and locations were scrolled across the bottom of the screen. This entire part of the film is very intense. There were firefights, hand-to-hand combat, and bombing missions, which were so close to our own men that there were friendly fire casualties. As darkness engulfed the battalion things got worse. LTC Moore walked among his soldiers reassuring them and telling them they did well to that point and to continue. Casualties were mounting. Moore was seen several times praying over the dead and wounded members of his battalion. This showed his compassion even more for his men. As word was spreading back home of casualties the wives soon found out that the Army was not prepared for this. Taxicab drivers were delivering those dreaded telegrams. For whatever reason it showed that there were no chaplains or counselors there to handle this process. I don't recall that ever really happening so I'm hoping that was just a little bit of the Hollywood effect put on the film. Whatever the case was, in this movie Julie Moore took it upon herself to deliver all the messages to the spouses of her husband's soldiers. Meanwhile Joe Galloway knew that there was heavy fighting going on and he jumped onboard a chopper to go see for himself. Armed only with several cameras he goes into the heat of the battle. When asked why he was there Galloway said to help the people home understand the war by shooting pictures not a rifle. More air strikes are called in and one of the men Joe came to know briefly was badly burned. He carried him to a waiting chopper. This was a rather gruesome scene. The second and third days of battle weren't any better. The NVA kept bringing in fresh troops as our soldiers were trying to continue the battle themselves. LTC Moore asked for a head count of his men and when he found two were missing he went out himself looking for them. As Joe Galloway continued shooting pictures Moore said &#34;I'll never forgive myself that my men died and I didn't.&#34; Joe commented, &#34;I don't know how to tell this story.&#34; And Moore's response was &#34;You got to Joe. Tell them how my troopers died. &#34;LTC Moore refused to leave the IaDrang till all his men living or dead were taken off the field of battle. He kept his promise although 234 of his troopers died. LTC Moore wrote personal letters to each deceased soldier's family. His compassion continued throughout the next 235 days his battalion was in Vietnam and to this day. Before the credits rolled there was a brief narration about how our soldiers returned home with no bands, flags, or welcomes. The soldiers knew they fought for each other. The final scene was one of two soldiers, one in a wheelchair, going down what appeared to be an airport hallway. A woman with her children approached them and she pulled the children away from the soldiers as if they were diseased or something. The names of the fallen soldiers of the 1/7 are listed on Panel 3 East of The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. Moore and Galloway told their story well. Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson portrayed it excellently. Though graphic in nature this is a MUST SEE movie. Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions. I believe the film has shown what the IaDrang Valley battle was really like. Those people who may be squeamish about blood, burns, broken burns, etc might want to stay home. BUT if you are a true fan and prefer seeing war movies-this is the one to go to! You not only see the battle scenes but also learn some of the relationship between the men, their wives, and families.

B00005JME0|5.0|Synopsis : Having experienced black out session when he was a child, Evan Treborn (Kutcher) tries to relive incidents of his childhood to bring back his memories. Using the journals he kept as a child brings the moment back to play, more realistic than a dream. <br />Plot : Please note first and foremost, this movie was billed as a Horror/Drama but it falls into the Sci-fi/Drama category to me. I classify anything dealing with some form of time travel to be considered science fiction. Now, on with the show......This was an amazing movie filled with all forms of emotions; sincerity, disgust, betrayal, hopefulness and the neverending question - should one person play \\"god\\" over everyone else's lives? <br />Cast/Characters : I know what you are thinking, oh my, Jekyll actually sat through an Ashton Kutcher movie. Trust me, I amaze even myself. But in all honesty, he does a fantastic job in a dramatic role. You don't even realize who the actor is you are swept up in the moment. Powerful performance also by Amy Smart as we get to see her in different stages and \\"lives\\" - how she can be beautiful and glamourous in one scene and a totally wasted out drug addict in the next.<br />Pace : The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, but did well in building up the story of each character and allowing us to get into their heads for a moment. Once the main character was grown and in college, the rest of the movie went pretty fast, jumping from \\"life\\" to \\"life\\" smoothly. Overall smooth sailing to the end of the movie.<br />F/X : Not really a special effects type of movie, other than the sequences of Evan going from present time to past time. I WAS impressed with the use of sound and colors though in the movie. Depending on which person he would meet up with would determine the colors used to surround that person, wether they were happy or sad. In one scene we have a very happy, well adjusted girl surrounded by pinks and yellows and a very sunshine-sort-of-day and then within the same scene a very depressed, hurt and angry boy with just minimal colors of grey, white and black surrounding him. Truly an amazing sequence to me. <br />Jekyll's Final Thoughts : This was definitely a surprize movie for me. Low expectations for me entering the film in having to sit through 2 hours of Ashton turned out to be 2 hours of an emotional roller coaster of a movie. I plan to watch this one again just to grasp on some moments that left me wondering. This is a must see movie - 5 stars! Just remember that it isn't a horror movie......
B00005JK8K|3.0|Have any of you seen this film? It was awesome but left a lot to be desired at the same time. It was loud with lots of action, war violence, and graphic scenes. It was loud as war films are. Some scenes were reminiscent of the first half-hour of &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot;<br />It was billed as being about the Navajo codetalkers of WW II-and yet I found there was little in the film about them even though there were two main characters who were suppose to be codetalkers.<br />The movie began with a battle scene in the Solomon Islands. The Marines were outnumbered and all but one survived this particular battle that was shown. Next Nicholas Cage, who portrayed Corporal (CPL) Joe Enders from Pennsylvania, was recuperating in a hospital in Hawaii. A Navy WAVE, played by Frances O'Connor, who cared for him helped him return to the front lines and yet he didn't appear to have any feelings for her. Throughout the rest of the film she sends him letters to which he never responds.<br />The film jumped to a group of Navajo enlisting into the Corps. Next they were going to class where they studied the code they would use. There was little really shown about their actual training. We know that they used their own language as a code the Japanese never broke during WW II. Here the audience is introduced to two Navajo: Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach, and Charlie Whitehorse-portrayed by Roger Willie making his acting debut. Both Adam and Roger are Native American Indians although Adam was born in Canada.<br />CPL Enders is given a special mission. He is to protect with his own life if necessary the life of the Navajo assigned to him and at all costs protect the code-in other words kill the Navajo if the enemy gets too close or captures him. At the same time he is promoted in rank to sergeant. He meets Sergeant (SGT) Anderson, played by Christian Slater. They have opposites outlooks on life but the same mission which neither are sure they can fulfill.<br />There was little shown in the movie about the relationship between the Navajo and the rest of the Marines. Except for a scene where one Marine assaulted Yahzee the rest of the film simply showed them being called names. SGT Anderson befriended Charlie. They even began playing music together, the Navajo on the flute and Slater using a harmonica. They struck a true friendship.<br />As much as I like Nicholas Cage and his films I felt like he was the vehicle for this movie and not the codetalkers. SGT Enders stayed aloof to forming a relationship with Yahzee. Perhaps it was that his platoon was cut to shreds in the first scenes of the movie. Perhaps he didn't want to become friends because he had orders to kill Yahzee if the enemy got too close to him. Perhaps he felt as though he didn't want to befriend another soldier. BUT I felt that Cage had too much screen time when I thought the movie was suppose to be about the Navajo.<br />The main thrust of the movie was supposed to be a battle on the island of Saipan in 1944. The American forces knew there were over 30,000 Japanese on the island and yet they attacked. It was yet another brutal battle from one end of the island to the other. Particularly disturbing was a friendly fire incident even though I know those things happened all too often.<br />But the few scenes of the Navajo using their codetalking was what the movie was suppose to be about. Maybe I didn't see it-I'm not sure now. Yes the Navajo used their radios to call in information to higher headquarters. They passed along info regarding locations, quantities, units, etc. Sometimes they chattered among themselves since no one else could understand them including their counterparts-the Americans.<br />There were breathtaking scenes in the film. I admit to shedding tears during it. It was a good movie but I expected to see more of exactly what the Navajo did. However I will say that what &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; did for the WW II generation and &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; did for the Vietnam generation &quot;Windtalkers&quot; tries to do for our Native Americans who served during WW II in our Armed Forces. Their code was never broken. They deserved more credit than they received at the time and even since then. This movie was to be their vehicle for that acceptance.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Great film.  Although there has to be a suspension of disbelief in all of these sci-fi/thriller movies, &quot;Underworld&quot; tries to tie in a little science with the lore.  The plot is somewhat predictable, but the action is pretty good....and Kate Beckinsale-she looks incredible in all her movies, but she's especially gorgeous in this one.  She speaks with her native English accent as well...quite nice.
B000002H2H|5.0|I wrote a review recently about &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; and gave it 4 stars, almost a 5-star review. But since I'm listening to more Metallica, I'm appreciating &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; more. It's their best behind &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot; Here are my ratings for each song from a rating score of 10/10:<br />1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10<BR>2. Ride the Lightning 10/10<BR>3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 9/10<BR>4. Fade to Black 9.5/10<BR>5. Trapped Under Ice 10/10<BR>6. Escape 9/10<BR>7. Creeping Death 9.5/10<BR>8. The Call of Ktulu 9.5/10<br />Overall: A (95.62%)= 5 STARS!
B000002KKC|5.0|This album may not have the commercial accessibilty or raw emotion of Rumours, but it shows Fleetwood Mac at its creative and ambitious peak.  With Lindsey Buckingham producing, Tusk showcases the band's growth as songwriters and artists.<br />Stevie Nicks turns in the best songwriting of her career here.  All 5 of her contributions are winners:  Angel, Beautiful Child, Storms, Sisters of the Moon, and Sara.  Storms and Beautiful Child are both tender ballads of love and loss, but show a wiser, more mature Stevie than on previous records.  Sisters of the Moon is a hard rocker with typical Nicks mysticism.  Sara became a top ten hit and features some of Nicks' most personal lyrics to date.<br />Buckingham's quirky, folksy sound is present on most of his tracks.  More biting than even his tunes on Rumours, songs such as Not That Funny and What Makes You Think You're the One provide insight on his current feelings toward Nicks.  And on the Ledge, we get to see how close Lindsey is to losing it.<br />Christine McVie turns in her usual set of solid ballads.  Never Make me Cry and Over & Over are pretty disposable.  But the light Never Forget, the seductive Brown Eyes, and the harmonious Honey Hi, are great songs by McVie.<br />All in all, Fleetwood Mac's most edgy and mature work.  Highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is an amazing album, full of stuff that the kids have gotta love!
0385504209|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book BUT if your main interest in this book is learning things about early Christianity that the average Christian doesn't want you to know, you are better off reading something else because Brown gets too many facts wrong to be trusted.  It is simply wrong, for example, to say that no one thought of Jesus as divine until the Council of Nicea.  (What about the docetists?)  There were in fact a variety of early views that clashed.  Try reading instead The Secret Gospel by Morton Smith.  There are no car chases in Smith's book, but it is an interesting account of finding what seems to be a passage from a secret gospel of Mark.  Moreover, it shows how a real scholar thinks, which includes considering alternative explanations.  And Smith's conclusions are quite unorthodox, if that's what you're looking for.
B00005Y7GQ|5.0|Words fail me when trying to describe this movie to those who have not been fortunate enough to see it.  Imagine if the Matrix took place inside an 8-bit NES Super Dodge Ball cartridge, or if &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; were crossbred with &quot;Solarbabies.&quot;  Stephen Chow, the director and star of this film, is a comedic genius on the level of David Cross during the Mr. Show days, or Ben Stiller at his top cinematic form (Mystery Men, for example).  In it, he plays an ever-optimistic kung-fu student who is desperately trying to reintroduce the ancient arts to a jaded world of cellphones and jetliners.  A chance meeting with a once-famous soccer star, now elderly and crippled, sets up the plot for one of the most well-executed and hilarious kung-fu movies of all time: the two conspire to combine kung-fu with soccer, creating a nigh-invincible team of superhumans.  This was obviously Chow's largest budget movie to date, as the special effects are on par with American films, but even without that extra boost the story would carry on just as well as it does in his other films (such as &quot;God of Cookery&quot;).  I won't try to explain any further, as my pithy language skills could never do justice to the ever-increasingly preposterous scenes they would attempt to describe -- instead, I'll simply say: see it, and see it now!
B000002H2H|5.0|Before the &quot;The Black Album&quot; and the commercialization of Metallica, before the lyrical masterpieces of &quot;...And Justice For All,&quot; even before the titan &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; there was &quot;Ride the Lightning.&quot; In 1984, you had Van Halen, Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, and all other sorts of musical conglomerates. This album, however, was craving for someone to hear it's voice, and was the match that started the bonfire that is the genre, &quot;metal.&quot; Not as sloppy as &quot;Kill 'em All,&quot; RtL was a huge improvement for the band, as well as the image of metal as a whole. The lyrics were more developed, the guitar work was much better, and the overall sound was much more &quot;constructive.&quot; Overall, the album fit together nicely with each individual song, over the main theme of death. Well, with an electric guitar blasting in your ears, what did you expect? Love and peace? I thought not. This is one of the most interesting, in my opinion, of Metallica's albums. No one really noticed them yet, and they weren't commercialized like they are now, or even to the extent of when The Black Album came out. The music had no strings attached. They had nothing to hold them back on what they said, thought and felt, and the band showed us all of this rage channeled into one hell of an album. It was raw, just the way metal fans like it.
B00005R5G9|4.0|I am a total sucker for Kim Cattrall.  Porky's, Big Trouble in Little China, Turk 182 -- I've seen 'em all, man, and if there's an actress who more personifies the films of the 80's, I'll eat my hat.  In that sense, &quot;Mannequin&quot; is Cattrall's swan song, as it is quite possibly the most ludicrous thing ever committed to film.  Showcasing an unexpected all-star cast (Andrew McCarthy, Estelle Getty, James Spader, Meshaque Taylor, G.W. Bailey) &quot;Mannequin&quot; relates that age-old story we all know so well: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Builds New Girl Out Of Spare Parts.<br />Jonathan Switcher (McCarthy) is an impossibly flaky artist who can't seem to hold down a paying job for more than ten minutes.  At one place of employment, he sculpts his dream girl in the form of a mannequin; unbeknownst to him, he is reforming the body of a four-thousand year old Egyptian princess in fiberglass.  A serendipitous mishap lands him a job at a local department store, where (coincidentally) his living doll also happens to end up -- and one night, he discovers her magical secret.  Of course, it is only Switcher who can see her in the flesh, which leads to a series of embarassing mishaps with...<br />...oh, who the Hell am I kidding?  I refuse to sit here and type sycophantic drivel like a complete tool.  This movie is retarded.  I can't hide the fact with lauding praises for the decade's Reaganomic-influenced Hollywood excapisms or that amazingly phat electro soundtrack by Sylvester Levay of &quot;Three O'Clock High&quot; fame -- it's a stupid film and that's that.  I LOVE THIS STUPID FILM AND I AM NOT ASHAMED.  There, I said it.  I feel better.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I feel this is their best.  You may not agree, but what can I say about this legendary record that hasn't already been said?  If you're too young to remember them or if by some horrible twist of fate you've missed out, BUY THIS NOW!<br />This is one of the top ten rock albums ever made.<br />To add something useful, Sony's remastering on the Clash CD's is excellent.  This CD comes very close to my original CBS british pressing.  The US Epic LP's and CD's sounded terrible and they don't convey the emotion the way the import LP's do.  I'd go as far as to say that they're not even the same album, really.  These new Clash CD's come very close, so even if you have these albums already, I'd say it's a worthwile investment to discover these recordings all over again.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First off, how in the hell can this even be compared to Godsmack, SOAD, and Linkin park.<BR>Like, come on.<br />Ive been a fan of Dream Theater for a while now, and without a doubt this is one my favourite cd's (by anyone), especialy after listening to it over 100 times :-P. <BR>Its my favourite, but it is still far from their best work (SFAM or I&amp;W). Even though this is the weakest DT cd, its still mindblowing.<br />1.As I Am<BR>Starts off with the last note of SDOIT, nice. Great song, catchy parts all over. <BR>4/5<br />2. This Dying Soul<BR>Probably Petruccis best lyrics ever. A Continuation of The Glass Prison. Amazing song, in every way. Starts off with a hard hitting riff and the amazing double bass beats of Portnoy. 3rd Favourite on the cd<BR>4.5/5<br />3. Endless Sacrifice<BR>Best Song On The Cd<BR>Period<BR>It may be one of the best songs theyve ever written. Starts off with a slow acoustic riff, then blasts into a metal masterpiece.<BR>5/5<br />4. Honor Thy Father<BR>Probably the weakest song on the cd. Everything is good, except for the chorus, which sounds....unfinished. Really angry lyrics from Mike, and the most hard hitting song on the album. But oh my god, LaBrie raps. By god, worst thing ive ever heard.<BR>3/5<br />5. Vacant<BR>The break in the middle of the album. Written by Labrie, and performed by Rudess and Myung (i belive). Really nice song, mellow, and the chello(sp?) adds a nice touch<BR>4/5<br />6. Stream of Conciousness<BR>The instrumental on the album. Really kick ass song. Great the whole way through. One of the best instrumentals (with Erotomania and The Ytse Jam) theyve ever written, if not the best. <BR>5/5<br />7. In the Name Of God<BR>This song is my 2nd favourite on the cd. Its a hard hitting song, with contreversal lyrics. About justifying violence and killing with the words in the bible. I love the scale at the start, it sounds so cool<BR>5/5<br />Overall, a REALLY good disc from DT. Not their usual, but then again, their usual is insane. I guess we were spoiled silly with SFAM and 6DOIT.<br />-Matt
B0000VAFO0|3.0|I swear, some people expect too much from action movies these days.  <br />This movie is set in the RPG world of White Wolf's Werewolf and Vampire.  If you don't know what an RPG is, it's a role-playing game like Dungeons and Dragons.  The whole plot, the setting, the characters and the way they interact with each other are lifted from the rule books.<br />Is this a bad thing?  No, not really.  It's a good story, though a bit contrived.  But there aren't many good vampire movies being made these days.  Blade was okay, but after the vampire club scene at the beginning, the rest of the movie was anticlimactic.  Bram Stoker's Dracula was a joke with Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves competing for the worst fake British accent oscar.  Dusk 'till Dawn was fun, but not great.  I think the last really good vampire movie was Dracula, the one from the late 70's with Frank Langella and Lawrence Olivier.  That's not a lot of good vampire movies in the last 25 years.<br />This movie was a solidly good one from an action movie standpoint.  The weakest point was the love story between Kate Beckinsale's character and a newly created werewolf, one that was sort of the werewolf version of Neo in the Matrix or Paul Atreidies of Dune.  There really wasn't much of a spark between them.  I understand Kate's character being portrayed as cold and distant early on in the film, but she never really warmed up later to her so-called \\"love interest\\".  <br />I enjoyed the action and definitely enjoyed Kate Beckinsale running around in tight black Matrix-esqe fetish gear (sorry, I did).  Her repeated entrance through the front door of the vampire's mansion became rather repetitive, and it's use to show off all the pretty goth vampires hanging around being terribly decadent got a bit boring.  After reading the negative reviews I didn't expect much and was actually pleasantly suprised, but I'm a fan of the genre and never think an action movie is going to be something it's not.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|\\"American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" picks up where \\"American III: Solitary Man\\" left off - Cash providing an eclectic mix of covers and originals, backed by a first rate band and the warm production of Rick Rubin.  I honestly did not think that Cash could top \\"American III\\", but by time \\"Hurt\\" was halfway through, my jaw dropped in awe.  I've always felt that to call Cash's music \\"country\\" simply didn't do justice to his talent and vision.  It's clear on \\"American IV\\" that he's as comfortable covering Nine Inch Nails, as he is Paul Simon and The Beatles.  Few, if any, musicians today could pull of what Cash did with his last four albums.  The American Recordings are a testament to the virtuosity of Cash as an artist and performer.  \\"American IV\\" once again proves that Cash is King.
B000003TAR|5.0|The music is hardcore rage. The songs are demoralizing and so replete with suicide references, I gotta wonder if this highly corrosive album didn't lead those close to Kurt Cobain to seek help for him. On the other hand, hindsight is 20/20 and you can never tell people what to think or how to feel. If you just wanna rock, IN UTERO delivers, but beneath the surface, Kurt has a few messages and a few complaints - many about himself.<br /><br />The breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Serve the Servants\\" - a steady, heavy rocker with the opening line declaring, \\"Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I'm bored and old\\" and setting the stage for his cynicism. The honeymoon is definitely over.<br /><br />\\"Scentless Apprentice\\" - is a spiralling scorcher. The bizarre, paranoid lyrics refer to a sort of sanitized death fantasy: \\"I lie in the soil and fertilize the mushrooms/ Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume.\\"<br /><br />\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" - With lines like \\"Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back,\\" this is likely the most disturbing song to ever go into heavy rotation on alt-rock radio. It manages to be much more shocking and vulgar than any of the \\"no-no\\" words routinely edited from the air, and its dark poetry is utterly credible and compelling. Characteristics like its ominous tone and ticking time-bomb pacing make this songs one of Nirvana's best. I especially love the chorus with Kurt's string-bending guitar whine and Krist Novoselic's super-deformed bass. And, of course, Dave Grohl pounds his drums silly.<br /><br />\\"Rape Me\\" - is similar to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in guitar style. It's a gut-wrenching blast from victim to abuser that, I'm sure, too many of us can relate to.<br /><br />\\"Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" - great, angry tune, another rage against a-holes. (an aside - the movie \\"Frances\\" is a great, quick way to learn about the tragic life of Frances Farmer)<br /><br />\\"Dumb\\" - The mellowest song on the album and a great one. \\"I think I'm dumb.\\" I understand  lyrics from this song are printed on his tombstone. The song does illustrate how Kurt saw himself as different from most people.<br /><br />\\"Very Ape\\" - totally rocks and simultaneously ridicules \\"been-there-done-that\\" snobs.<br /><br />\\"Milk It\\" - very heavy song and very twisted in which the singer is his \\"own parasite.\\" It contains a pretty obvious death wish: \\"Look at the bright side is suicide (sic)\\" (also refers to an \\"Obituary birthday\\" which reminds me he died on mine - April 5)<br /><br />\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" - is a gorgeous song even with its heavy guitar distortion delivery. \\"Give me Leonard Cohen afterworld/ So I can sigh eternally.\\" The singer is portrayed as either elderly or very unhealthy in some way.<br /><br />\\"Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter\\" - More great rock from their dense punk jungle. More raving against the world and himself - \\"What is wrong with me?\\" But he manages to urge us to find our place and \\"Speak the truth.\\"<br /><br />\\"tourettes\\" - is an awful disease, but this song is a very cool, frenzied blast of chaos.<br /><br />\\"All Apologies\\" - is clearly a goodbye of sorts. It's very sad although it's not sung that way. This is another one whose popularity just amazes me. The lyrics almost sound like a suicide note. Some of the lyrics seem particularly indicting against \\"She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.\\" Probably best not to discuss this further since everyone seems scared silly of her for whatever reason (and Amazon will delete reviews too critical of her). Anyway, I especially like how Kurt sings, \\"Everyone is gay.\\" I'm straight, but I think everyone is born with a certain potential to be gay and our culture determines sexual morays and behaviors. Just look at ancient Greek society.<br /><br />Incredible album but harsh both musically and lyrically. It's pretty telling that Kurt thought about naming it \\"I Hate Myself and Want to Die,\\" but I guess someone talked him out of it (probably the record company). I wish someone had talked him out of actually doing it. Note: Like many, I am deeply troubled by the mysterious, questionable circumstances of Cobain's death and the shoddy police work, but no one can ignore the fact that IN UTERO by itself points to a troubled, suicidal mind.eone had talked him out of actually doing it.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Words can't describe how much I love this movie. I first saw it in the movies when I was a kid, and I've adored it ever since. Beautiful animation, great music, amazing story. I'm glad they finally brought out the dvd because my video was so messed up. One complaint though, the Morning Report absolutely blew. I don't understand why they even out that in there. Other than that, excellent.

0399103422|5.0|Quite Possibly The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read. The pinnacle of morality paradoxically combined with a stereotypical vice. Simply stated, this book is unbelievable. The movie does not even come close to depicting accurately the masterful work of Mario Puzo (and the movie is very very good). Read it. What more can I say?
0156027321|4.0|\\"Love is hard to believe, ask any lover.  Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist.  God is hard to believe, ask any believer.  What is your problem with hard to believe?\\"  This question is one that plagues a world where realism is a necessity and the unreal is scary.  The belief in such impalpable concepts as love, life, and God, is hidden within the pages of the seemingly tangible book, Life of Pi by Yahn Martel.<BR> Piscine Molitar Patel, a young, skinny, Indian boy asked this thought provoking question after surviving a nightmare, but a nightmare tinged with love.  His action packed adventure, while entertaining, examined the heart in the deepest of levels.  Pi, having shortened his name as a youth because of the inaccuracies in pronunciation, was stranded in the middle of the ocean in a lifeboat: himself, a man-eating tiger, and God.  Martel's exploration of religion, animal life, and ocean life in this fiction novel was one requiring much research.  He structures the book as if it were a true account.  Martel interviews the fictitious character Pi, and tells the story from his point of view so as \\"no inaccuracies or mistakes are made\\"  <BR> Pi narrates the story through his own voice: as an adult looking through his eyes as a child.  This added literary instrument allows us as readers to step into his shoes to experience his discoveries and tragedies realistically.  How, for example, could you truly understand the fierceness of the wild animals had it not come from the perception of a young and innocent child.  Perhaps Martel was attempting to point out our lack, as adults, of humility in association with wild animals and their unappreciated power over us.  Martel makes quite apparent the impact of certain aspects of life that we now take for granted and that many adult readers look over because of their assimilation to how mundane experiences can become. <BR> Martel introduced Pi as a curious boy, growing up in an Indian zoo, with an insatiable hunger for God.  He devotes his life to three incredibly separate religions: Christianity, Hindu, and Islam.  These three religions, although very different in their beliefs, are bound by his undying love for God and his constant urge to show that love. Pi is able to use the love from those beliefs to overcome the worst enemy on the ocean: fear.  His fear of the animal life, day to day hunger and thirst, and losing his will to survive constantly plague him.  Yet, his love for God pulls him out of the deep swells of sadness that he experiences almost on a daily basis.<BR> Although Martel states that Life of Pi will encourage readers to question their beliefs and even more so their faith, I found it lacked in depth in this area.  Martel was well versed in the beliefs of Christianity, Hindu, and Islam, as well as Atheism and Agnosticism; however, he failed to strengthen these topics toward the end.  Chapters 21 and 22 are considered the core chapters and discuss views on religion from different perspectives, yet, as Pi's story undulates into scenes of the ocean and his countless days alone at sea, a lack of God is more apparent.  Martel does include instances where Pi mentions his beliefs.  However, this surface description does not sink to the core of his writing.<BR> Martel's explorations into anthropomorphism, and human and animal relationships, are all found in abundance throughout the novel.  He gives human characteristics to the animals, describing the death of one of Pi's shipmates as \\"her eyes expressed fear in such a humanlike way, as did her strained whimpers\\" (131).  This emotional bond that Martel creates, is one that enforces a lasting and emotional relationship with most of the animal characters of the book.  In fact, an entire chapter is devoted to a conversation with one of the animals on board.<BR> Throughout most of the novel, Martel presents a one sided view on topics such as the value of zoos in animals' lives.  His stance, or Pi's stance, is that zoo's are havens for wildlife and the only reason tragedies or attempts of escape occur is because the animal experienced some abnormal change in the environment.  Pi uncovers a world where animals are happy and healthy if environmental circumstances remain stoic.  He succeeds in opening our eyes to the harsh judgments of an animal's worth in our world.  This common mistake is pointed out in the gruesome explanations of animal strength, page 36-38, superiority, the hierarchy on the lifeboat at the beginning of Pi's horrific journey, and in a huge twist at the end that leaves you almost feeling sick to your stomach.  Although some might not enjoy his constant preaching on animal rights, this information is useful to fully understand the novel and come away with some sense of humility.<BR> Personally, I very much enjoyed Pi's adventure throughout the lonesome sea.  I began reading the book expecting an entertaining and surface read.  The novel was entertaining but also introduced questions that I had never considered being an intricate part of the story.  Martel drew together all of the issues of Pi's life and journey and created a final chapter that grabbed at all the connections you created with the characters and broke those links.  It was truly a well-written ending with a very unexpected and worthy twist.<BR> Martel's seemingly harmless and entertaining story of a young Indian boy stranded in the ocean could be geared to a young audience.  The animals and basis of the surface story provide excellent entertainment for all audiences.  Yet, Life of Pi includes deep and personal sections that encourage readers, who have the ability to see past the painted picture and the surface story, to question their beliefs on love, life, and most importantly God.  This well written novel introduces concepts that only more mature readers can fathom or simply believe.
B000002UAX|3.0|Within this 1968 release is a respectable album; one that actually represents a welcome reprieve from the three year pop lite hiatus that the group took that ended with Sgt. Pepper.  Unfortunately, because the group elected to populate this two album set with 15-20 forgettable tracks, the dozen or songs that could have comprised a better album (USSR, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and others) are intermittently placed from beginning to end, which makes the finished release too long and difficult to listen to from start to finish. 3 stars.

B000089CJI|5.0|well to tell you the truth this isn't really indie &quot;rock&quot; this is more indie &quot;electro-pop&quot;. But no matter what it is, I love it! I was amazed at first listen at the beautiful melodies and beats that were crafted here. I am kind of a newbie to the world of indie rock (I love emo, if you consider that indie) and I've just been finding out some cool bands. The Postal Service is one of those bands that just flat out rocks! I don't care what people say about it, it is amazing! Get this CD now if you like Radiohead or indie music!
6305076995|5.0|I remember going to see this concert in the theater when I was merely 12 years old. I was so captivated by the tight orchestration that the band provided, I went to see it almost on a daily basis (summer time) while it played. From there I collected what Yes had recorded by that time (Close to the Edge, Time and a Word etc..). A very tough sell to friends at that time as they were not a \\"radio based\\" group, but Yes certainly proved that there was much more to rock than what was being portrayed on the radio which offered such limited access due to music length.<br />I have to say that the line-up for this concert is what I truly consider to be Yes. Rick Wakeman simply cannot be touched and the same holds true for Steve Howe and Alan White. Which on a side note, Alan did join the group while the tour was on the road and he filled in without flaw.<br />I had the pleasure of seeing Yes in 1979 (the round stage) and again in 1984. By far the most compelling show was the '79 show which opened with Siberian Katru and went straight into Heart of the Sunrise (same as the CD version of this tour). Granted that there is not mega effects (like say Pink Floyd's Pulse), but we have to remember that this was the early 70's.<br />For true Yes fans, this is the DVD to own. Trust me on this. If you like Yes, you will truly appreciate this DVD.
0316666343|4.0|14 year old Susie Salmon likens her &quot;life&quot; in heaven to the penguin in the glass globe--&quot;trapped in a perfect world&quot;.  Susie narrates this story from heaven, which is where she wound up after being brutally raped and murdered.  She's in heaven, shouldn't it be perfect?  Shouldn't everyone be happy and surrounded by everything and everyone they love?  Sebold's vision of heaven is an interesting one.  While Susie will never again want for anything, she is still bound to her family and friends on earth.  She accompanies them through their daily lives and chronicles their pain while telling us her story.  <BR>Susie's was a typical happy family.  The horror of her disappearance and its effect on each member of her family seem genuine.  You cringe when she details how she ended up in heaven, and you can almost feel the paralysis that sets into her family.  I know if she were my daughter, getting out of bed in the morning would be close to impossible.  But life goes on, as Susie tells us.  They've turned a corner, but they are still living.<BR>Sebold does a wonderful job of character development in this book.  We don't learn much about Susie's mother, or really like her much, but that all seems to me a result of her incredible pain.  She is completely turned off to life.  Susie's father is the one holding the family together, such as it is. Her sister is in the unenviable position of being close to Susie in age, and looking very much like her.  Buckley is too young to understand, but he fills in the gaps in his life the best he can.  One of the more interesting characters in the book is a schoolmate of Susie's, Ruth.  Ruth is one of those kids we all knew in school, without really knowing her.  The bond she forms with Susie is a fascinating one.  <BR>The story of what happens to the people in Susie's life is interesting and not completely predictable.  After all, if you've not experienced anything like this (thank God) how can you know what will happenor how people will change?  It's an interesting study of a family dealing with loss.  Sebold has done a marvelous job of making us feel Susie's loss, and the parts of her life she feels she has missed out on.  The love between the characters is almost palpable, not an easy task for a writer to make us feel.  By mixing in some humor, everyone seems more genuine, and the book does not become maudlin.<BR>An interesting, gracefully told story of real people.  Highly recommended.
B0000524CY|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time in high school and just recently had a chance to see The Version You've Never Seen.  It still remains the scariest movie I have EVER seen.  I watched this movie during the day and it still took me several nights before I could sleep.  The spider-walk scene was new and definitely disturbing. I'd give it more than five stars if I could. This movie is a must have for any horror fan!!
0375713751|3.0|OK, I cannot relate to our main character's job, unhappy childhood, or income.  But Kate's life is similar in more ways than it is dissimilar to many women out there who are trying to do it all.  It's not a question of whether she can do it all, it's a question of whether she can do it all to the high standards she has set for herself.  And let's remember:  this is fiction---Kate is not real!  But she is very funny.<BR>We get to accompany Kate through her hectic days of managing her job (which uncomfortably includes a lot of travel, most of it international), her 2 small children, and her husband.  Her husband's ineptness, whether feigned, real, or imagined, is hilarious and something I bet all of us can relate to.  I am sure they based this character on my husband!  And I'm also sure there are a lot of you out there saying the same thing.  It's important not to read too much into this book---it's not meant to be a social commentary, it's meant to entertain by making you laugh.  And it works beautifully!  I snickered my way through page after page, and really did find myself hoping she'd find a way to make it all work.  In the end, Kate reassesses her life and decides that driving herself isn't working for anyone.  Maybe you will and maybe you won't agree with her, and how she decides she will cope with it all but you will be entertained until the end.  Recommended to any woman who needs a 26 hour day.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It's very rare to find a CD on which every single song is good.  Such is the case with this CD by Norah Jones.  I love every song and never get tired of listening to them.  I have three copies......one for home, one for work and one for my car.  My seven year old daughter even loves it and sings along with it in the car.  The music is all soft and relaxing with the vocals of an extremely talented singer.  Norah Jones deserves every award she got for this!
0385504209|1.0|And I thought it was just me.  The book is poorly written and contains woefully inadequate plot and character developments.  From what I understand it is also full of historical inacurracies.<br />It's almost as if it's written for people with short attention spans.  It's only a matter of time before Hollywood makes it into a movie.  I wonder which big name star will play Langdon?
B000002N2P|5.0|I love this CD but I felt I should correct someone on how this CD got its name.  A friend of the band did the cover work for Insomniac and a typical piece of artwork like the one shown takes a few days at least to complete. The artist finished it in less than a day by working throughout the night, something like 17 hours straight.  Billie Joe exclaimed, &quot;How did you finish it so quick? The artist said, Well, I don't know, but I must be a d*** insomniac&quot;.  Hence the name of the album.  <br />And if you like Dookie, don't hesitate to pick up this gem.  It is definitely at par with Dookie.
630512762X|5.0|Legendary Hong Kong action director John Woo (The Killer, Hard Boiled) helped craft a modern mainstream action classic in 1997 with Face/Off.  Despite the film's absurd premise: FBI Agent John Travolta swaps faces and identities with psycho terrorist Nicolas Cage, that doesn't take away from the high impact drama and superb performances from Travolta and Cage.  And did I mention the action scenes?  Face/Off contains some of the best action sequences to ever be seen in film today, and this film is still the best Woo film to be made in America.  Travolta and Cage perfectly imitate each other's traits while caught in Woo's balet of blood and bullets.  The only flaw of Face/Off is the DVD itself.  While the picture and sound quality are superb, there are no extras to be had other than the film's trailer.  Hopefully someday Paramount will have the good sense to re-release the film packed with extras.  Mainstream action rarely gets better than this.
B000053VAZ|3.0|I have to tell you that I have never been a Johnny Depp fan but recently have gotten into his movies.  What an underrated actor.  The movie was so-so but it's worth it just to see the performance that Johnny Depp gives.  He acts with his whole being.  You can see the humor in his eyes, the way he moves.  He is very impressive in this role.  As for the movie, good story line but could have been developed better.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Admittedly, \\"Afterglow\\" took a listen or two to begin to grow on me; the songs seemed kind of blah upon first impression. There was nothing that ripped my beating heart out of my chest, as on prior albums. However, a closer examination reveals that Sarah is as intensely forthright and emotive as ever. The difference is that she sounds more content overall in the substance of her life (parenting will do that to you!). While she has not gotten entirely away from critical, at times searing introspection, she does not need to be living an emotional trainwreck to come up with meaningful songs.<BR>Musically, the production, while a little densely layered in places, does not obscure Sarah's considerable talents-- in particular, her angelic voice.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This true story was so richly done and the acting was terrific!  At the end of it, you're actually feeling bad for the main character.  Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz gave outstanding performances.  It really takes you inside the world of drug lords and drug dealers.  Somehow you end up with compassion for this person and feel sad at how things turned out for him.  It was really a great film and one I would recommend.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This movie must have been a huge disappointment to all the Matrix fans out there, for it is not very good and to call it bad would not be missing the mark by much.<br />        On the intellectual level the film is interesting enough, (we get a through lesson in causality and all its aspects) especially the scene with the architect and the explanation of \\"the One's\\" role in maintaining the fabric of the matrix. However, clever philosophy does not make for compelling entertainment, as is evident in this film.<br />       This movie has the feel of a soap opera. It drags horribly in parts, especially the beginning. It has all the corny love triangles of the day time television and  token sex/rave scenes one expects to see in trple x not matrix. It seems as if the filmmakers aimed this movie at the 17 and under audience. The action sequences are spectacular as are the special effects but they feel unnatural and forced. the movie never gets into any kind of flow .<br />So if you haven't seen it, Don't. Leave yourself with the good opinion that matrix has created and this movie can only destroy
0446608955|5.0|Langdon Carter is a typical teenager of the late 50's and as such he joins his classmates in looking down on a devoutly religious girl in his class, Jamie, who favors brown cardigans and wears her hair in a bun.  The book shows an unlikely relationship between the two, first as co-leads in a play, but later as something much more.  Nicholas Sparks displays an uncanny ability to climb inside his 17-year-old main character's head and make him sound real.  He delves into themes of life, death, and faith with a deft hand and leaves the reader with a lot to think about.  This is definitely one of Sparks' best books.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Robert Deniro was fabulous in this film. He was really believable as a killer and he nailed that southern accent. The movie was scary but not that scary. My favorite part in the movie he when he hides under the car. Pure Genius!
B000002I8D|3.0|It is just so hard to really imagine it, when a artist debuts on the Billboard scene and the music scene, they really do it for a specific reason. For Phil Collins, he seemed to do it for all the way to the beginning of what seemed like the end of his life. His first marriage ended and he just didn't know how to become as a solo act. That truly was the case for his debut, and a symbol as a star away from Genesis. He ultimately knew he had to start his way to the top, but also reflect on love and life. He ultimately though at one point that he really wasn't actually good with knowing how to use words and he would just falter in the process. Anyway, that actually happened with Phil, and that childish feel, became a remarkable, but a fair debut for his own, and thensome.<br />His 1981 solo debut, Face Value, consists of some of his surprising but a little dark feel with his solo effort. The songs truly arranged very nicely, but it just wasn't as serious as Phil seemed to start. His later albums did better than this one did. Still, there are just some great songs like the spooky and dark, In The Air Tonight, which was the primary focused song on Phil Collins's first divorce, as well as other songs like This Must Be Love, and the incredibly upbeat and lively song, I Missed Again. This song includes some great songs including Tomorrow Never Knows, and the deep song, Droned. Although the songs are great, they just could use some more to them.<br />Although this was Phil's first actual debut as a solo act, it just isn't his best. I suggest you get his later records first, including the Grammy-Winning album, No Jacket Required, or the soulful, Both Sides. This one is not the first, but a very strong debut for a sensation from the serious side.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is a definate classic. It's about I mentally slow man and his extradinary way throughout life. Truely uplifting!
B00005AR3G|5.0|I can't begin to put into words what this movie means to me, I love this movie so much that I really don't understand how someone could give it a terrible review. I guess the only reason not to like it is when you dont give yourself to the movie and take it for what it is, sure its not the typical disney &quot;lovey dovey&quot; type movie, but thats whats so great about it....its almost a breath of fresh air with its quick wit and sarcasm. Don't get me wrong I love disney movies immensely and I can guarantee you will love this one and watch it more than 25 times.
B00008K9Z5|4.0|This Linkin Park album is awesome! In my opinion, it's not as great as their first album(Hybrid Theory), but it still deserves at least 4 STARS. This album, however, has a few tracks that sound similar to their previous recorded songs which are on the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; album, some people may disagree with me though. The CD case is awesome too, it's not the same old boring plastic cases we see all the time, it's a great new design. If like Rock, then this album is a MUST.
B00005QGAZ|3.0|The Original &quot;Thriller&quot; is one of the best recordings of all times!  So why couldn't they leave it alone?  You can't just enjoy the CD anymore without having to listen to a bunch of interviews towards the end of the CD.  I gave this CD 3stars because of the interviews, &quot;Thriller&quot; alone is still a 5 star CD.  Anyone in the music biz that may read this, please don't remake CD's and ruin them by adding non original content to them.  If I could, I'd take this CD back, and find an old original copy!
B00005AQE8|5.0|I bought this album back in 1997, and it will always top my list. If 2 Pac had not recorded these tracks before his Death, he would have been a nobody today. This album is what started his legacy. This album is what MADE RAP! And this album has also inspired many well known rappers whom are in our music industry today. If you are new to Rap, this album is a MUST!
B0001BKAEE|5.0|This was the greatest movie I have ever seen! This movie, for those who understand it, will all say that there questions were answered. It left no dougt who won and who lost! \\" Everything that has a beginning... has an end! \\" and what an end it was! My hat is off for everyone who took part in creating this epic trilogy!
B00005MP58|5.0|It's funny, I first became aware of this movie through the novel &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; (which, of course, is a modern version of P&amp;P).  Those who have read &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; know that Bridget has a huge crush on Mr. Darcy as played by Colin Firth.  In the movie version of the book, of course, Colin Firth plays Bridget's love interest, Mark Darcy.  So I bought P&amp;P sight unseen because I was utterly impressed with Colin Firth's performance in &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;--and I wanted to see what the big deal was with the scene where he dives into the lake.<br />P&amp;P is now my favorite movie.  <br />It is a wonderful adaptation of Jane Austin's novel--probably the best version ever made.  It is very nearly word-for-word, as a matter of fact, which is why the movie is so long.  It also makes reading the novel even more enjoyable, because I now have Alison Steadman's voice in my head whenever I read Mrs. Bennett's dialogue!<br />The actors' performances are exquisite.  Colin Firth IS Mr. Darcy in a way nobody else could possibly be.  Jennifer Ehle is a wonderful Elizabeth--she has such a spirit and presence about her.  And I must say, Crispin Bonham-Carter's Mr. Bingley is just as good-natured and vacuous as he should be.  <br />The only complaint I have with this movie is that there are no programmed subtitles.  I have an excellent ear for English accents, but I had a problem understanding a few lines.  <br />There is no better way to spend 5 hours than enjoying this movie.  By all means, save your breath to cool your porridge, and fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy!
B00009RDG9|3.0|I don't have much to say about this film. The basic storyline is not intolerable, the performances and direction are excellent, it looks great. But after watching it you may find yourself asking the same question I did - why did so many talented people choose to tell such an unremarkable, predictable story? I'm sure there are thousands of stories out there that would have been more worth telling using all the same people (except for the screenwriter, obviously). I mean, did Friedkin commission this thing? If so, then he's getting senile. Was it the only thing they'd let Billy direct and the other people jumped on board because it was helmed by Friedkin? I guess there are a lot of reasons why one movie gets made in/by Hollywood while another one does not. It just seems that with only so many films that can get made, with so many stories worth telling, why would you waste time on this? Is it something anyone actually WANTS to see, in a premeditated &quot;now what sort of story would I like to hear&quot; way? I doubt it. Here's a suggestion (yeah, I know, Freidkin ain't reading this, so what): go find a book, maybe even an unremarkable one, with a solid story, a few good characters, some raw material to work with, and buy it up for cheap (best to get a  not very good book, which equals, like, an Oscar winning film in relative value) then use it for your own purposes, totally reworking it to your liking (or, better yet, Billy, write your own). No one will demand you be true to their work, no hack screenwriter will demand rewrite priveledges, you'll be free to make a great film. Welles did it with Touch (Badge) of Evil, Hitchcock did it with Psycho, why not Friedkin. You reading this, Billy? Stop being a putz making medicore movies and make something GREAT again. I mean, you had Deschanel, Del Torro and Jones, man, what were you thinking??!!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|If you buy one Disney DVD this year, BUY THIS ONE.  Alice should not be compared to other Disney Classics of the time period (princess falls for prince, etc.)  It simply stands on its own.  It is about an independent little girl and her adventures.  No, it is not a romance like many of Disney's films, but a technicolor swirl of imagination.  In my opinion, it has the most interesting characters and music of any Disney film.
0671015206|5.0|This book gives the honest, straightforward truth about what the average person needs to do to become wealthy.  The simple truth is you have to spend less than you make, manage your debt wisely, and plan for the future.  For some, this may be a hard pill to swallow.  <br />I am only 26 years old and have utilized the concepts mentioned in the book to become financially independant and gain control of my finances.  I have a healthy investment portfolio and my mortgage (my only debt at this point) will be paid off in less than 7 years.  <br />More people need to read this book and apply the concepts it contains.  A testament to this is the rampant credit counseling services and payday advance loan shark establishments cropping up all over the country.  Many are convinced they need to spend all they have and go into debt to get the finer things in life.  Personally, I believe it is much better to be content and not have to worry or wonder about the future or what you will do if you lose your job when you live paycheck-to-paycheck.<br />This book points out that many of the people we consider affluent (based on their high consumption lifestyles) are actually UAWs who are in debt up to their eyeballs to maintain their rock-n-roll lifestyle.  Many physicians and attorneys fall into this category.  It also points out that you do not have to have a six figure income to attain millionaire status.  Many examples of average income earners are cited.  This book is a must-read for anyone wishing to be financially free and achieve their dreams.
B00008ADPF|5.0|I couldn't agree more that admitting to someone who possesses a finely developed taste for the genre of rock that you actually went out and purchased Nickelback's new CD is quite humiliating.  I personally consider myself to be amongst those with fine palettes for alternative rock, and when I catch myself floating into another world as Nickelback's new CD music plays, I gasp, and quickly run to hit the eject button.  It is almost a mortification and vilification for a rock enthusiast to actually own their CD... and truthfully, until 2 months ago, I feared being knocked off the rung I currently stand on on the ladder of rock culture, if caught with Nickelback in my stereo system.  I've had enough, however, of looking guiltily behind my shoulder when pressing Play, and I've finally come to my senses.  If there is any CD that I am willing to loose my position in the \\"rock society\\" just to listen to, it's this one.  I dear those of you who consider yourselves amid the elite of the rock world and the well-known Nickelback ridiculers to purchase this CD, listen to it with your third ear, and honestly state that it is not worth your time.  Claim that the rough grace of Do This Anymore, the somber sublimation of Feeling Way Too Damn Good, the raw retaliation of Figured You out, and the utter desperation of Should've Listened is not suitable for a fabulous rock classification and... Well, then I'm afraid it's you who isn't worthy of having your soul graced with their tunes.  I give this CD 5 stars and an additional bouquet of mauve hydrangeas.  Nickelback haters, I've come to find, are just those who aren't yet comfortable in their true skin, and scared of the consequences that may arise, should others find out that this is music they care for.  <BR>:: presses Play ::
0060987464|5.0|My frist impression of this book? WOW. Manson has been criticized a million times, and this book gives reason. This book can be read by anyone, anyone who has never even heard his music will still find this book highly addivctive. I have read several biographies and autobiographies (the dead, mccartney...) but none of them have a down to earth feeling and they all talk about technical aspects of their lives. They dont tell about their shortcomings, drugs, sex....ect. But manson gives a full dose of his life from the time he was a baby till the point when his single (The Beautiful people) reaches No.3 in the charts. This book is so explicit and raw that it makes it painfully normal but that same time extraordinary. Each one of us can relate to this book in some way or the other. You might hear some Goth kids come up and say \\"I'm different and this book is just like my life.\\" Thats rubbish. This book is for all us no matter what clothes we wear or what our background is. Its about life in a \\"normal\\" world that happens everyday seen through the eyes of someone with excellent ideas and visions with a view to change it. And yes, he too is normal and  ordinary trying to make his dreams come true and break away from the conformity of society. This book should be used by every one as a model to not only believe in yourselves, but also to acknowledge your shortcomings. Soccer moms and Businessmen alike should quit their demented and disgusting repetitive life and try to find something new. This book teaches us that life never stops....whether you are me or Marilyn Manson. Written simple and brilliant.    Book Highlight: Manson's explicit details about his rock star sex life.
B0001906O0|4.0|Being a fan of the Cure since I first heard the Concert and Curiousity cassette in late 1984, I have always searched out the more difficult to find material, B-sides, concert bootlegs, etc. If, like me, you like that sort of thing, you won't want to miss \\"Join the Dots.\\" And don't get me wrong, no one I know loves this band as much as I do.  So first the good news: It is a treasure trove of rare tracks. And as other reviewers have noted, the sound is greatly improved on the earlier B-sides that were put on the cassette version of Standing on a Beach back in 1986, especially \\"I'm Cold\\" one of my personal favorites. And now the bad : Their are several B-sides here that are readily available ( the Japanese Whispers set for starters ) and a few live  B-sides I was hoping for that are not ( the incredible \\"Faith\\" from the Charlotte Sometimes 12\\" single, and the cuts from the UK multi pack  of the \\"Hanging Garden\\"). Maybe  those will be included in next year's set of re-releases. I dock this one point for the covers included. The Cure have never been a covers band in my opinion. I have heard them tackle Hendrix before ( \\"Foxy Lady\\" on the \\"Three Imaginary Boys \\" cd, which Robert Smith either didn't want to, or just couldn't bring himself to sing, as that vocal was done by then bassist  Michael Dempsey )and wasn't too impressed. The covers I found here are ill-conceived and poorly excecuted. Most especially the anemic version of Bowie's Young Americans. I shuddered when I first heard it, and skip it when it comes on my cd player. In fact I will more than likely burn the 4 disc set down to my favorite tracks, which will fill maybe 3 discs, and keep the originals in a safe place. One last note, the book that comes with \\"Join the Dots\\"  actually makes me re think my 4 star rating, and give it 4 1/2 stars. It is invaluable for the Cure fan.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review. J
B000002MJC|4.0|It's interesting how much Songs of Faith and Devotion polarizes Depeche Mode's fan base.  Critics point to the band's middling attempts at gospel and the use of guitars and drums by a band that had been so publicly a keyboards-only venture.  And while there is some merit to the former attacks, the latter can be easily dismissed as a partisan, staunch unwillingness to give DM some room to grow.<br />Let's get it out of the way: \\"Condemnation\\" is not the best song DM has ever written, as it exists on SoFaD.  Much as Dave loves this song, I think to a large extent he adores it because the lyrics Martin wrote really hit home for him, and because it really shocked listeners into rethinking what Depeche Mode were about.  His voice, while appropriate to the mood, has sounded better elsewhere, and if you can find a concert version with Martin's voice instead, you'll find that his vocal interpretation is the better of the two.  \\"Get Right With Me,\\" while not bad, feels a bit out of place here as it does not quite marry the images of light and darkness the way the rest of the album does.  Like \\"Dressed in Black\\" from Black Celebration, it should probably have traded places with a B-side (in this case the jazzy \\"Death's Door\\").<br />There is a flip side to this coin, however.  The same ambition that makes \\"Get Right With Me\\" a slight misfire also inspires the warm beauty of \\"One Caress,\\" a gorgeous Martin Gore ballad accompanied only by a strings section.  I know of a woman who got into DM just because of this song.  Elsewhere on SoFaD, the added grind of guitar and crash of drums only serve to further augment some excellent songs.  \\"I Feel You\\" is an industrial, blatantly seductive swamp of distorted guitars with a riff along the lines of \\"Personal Jesus.\\"  \\"Walking In My Shoes\\" is another very personal song for Dave, showing just how thoroughly Martin understands his bandmate and longtime friend.  \\"Higher Love\\" is about as sexy as religion can get; it is at once angelic, dark, and soaring.  And even \\"Rush\\" fares well, particularly toward the end of the song.  But the best sixteen minutes of the album start with \\"Mercy In You,\\" follow through \\"Judas,\\" and conclude in the fiery lust of \\"In Your Room.\\"  DM have never sounded more tortured and hell-bound than they do in this song, managing to evoke the sexual subversiveness of \\"Strangelove\\" and \\"Never Let Me Down,\\" but ten shades darker.<br />As expected, there are those trademark interludes (after \\"Judas\\" and \\"Get Right With Me\\"), and they are nice enough that I sometimes wish they were fleshed out into full songs.  But they present nice transitions, and are part of what makes this an album and not just a collection of songs.<br />Although not perfect, Songs of Faith and Devotion comes pretty close.  It is an album of tension and audacity, out to prove to the world just what Depeche Mode were capable of.  It eventually led to the departure of Alan Wilder, but boy did he go out on a high note; never has his skill as a first-class musician been put to better use than on these ten tracks.  Depeche Mode's succeeding efforts are also good, but Martin (and probably everyone but Alan) would be happy to have Alan return to the group.  The singles for \\"In Your Room\\" and \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" are nothing short of amazing, so if you like what you hear on SoFaD, definitely pick these up too.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes answered the call for the best album of all time.  I could listen to it over and over again nonstop.  Every track is awesome and every song is a detailed description of life.  The beats of the drums are unbelievable along with the guitar and bass.  The 60s and 70s gave us some of the best music and The Strokes are in the same category.
0671027344|4.0|I wasn't capable of putting this book down.  It was an honest portrayal of a high schooler's life.  The only thing that I didn't like about this book is that the narrator, (Charlie), spoke like a 10 year old at times instead of a 16 year old.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yeah the five words describe the CD well. If you wanna have fun, just fun, pick it up right now. I recommend it to any music fan who wants to hear some great tunes and fresh beats from an awesome creator of music - Britney. Gone are, thank heavens, the 'hit me' and 'oops' days finally! She's given us some great music and though everyone wishes she had a better voice, she's made up for it with nice catchy tunes. She's tried her best and even worked with some big names like R.Kelly and P.Diddy (Moby's quite big but I consider him a sore loser. But his collaboration - Early Morning-is pretty good).<BR>The songs that rock on the CD are - MATM, Boom boom, showdown, Breathe on me, Toxic (is this good or what!), Outrageous, Touch of my hand, Brave new girl and Everytime. Early morning and the Hook up are fairly decent. Shadow is a nice ballad but I like Everytime a lot more. I usually don't like ballads but these two are pretty good and Everytime is so gonna be a single. <BR>Showdown has the most amazing beats ever!! I love it! Every song is different and catchy! I hope her future albums are also this good.<BR>Would have never expected this from the blonde pig-tailed teeny bopper who was dancing across the basketball court singing ---??<BR>I recommend it and it's definately worth putting aside a bit if dough for good stuff like this. Hope you found this review useful.
0062502182|5.0|This is the most amazing book ever. This story leads the reader on a journey of self discovery through the protagonist who goes through various obstacles and still comes out to find true happiness. This book is not simply a fable about following your dream, its a true mantra that teaches one how to truly see your life and how to live it. After reading this book I guarantee you'll have a different worldview on life, love everything! It has utterly changed mine forever. Actually, after having wrote this review, I think I'm gonna go re-read it again.
B000001ABD|3.0|Stevie Wonder is an excellent artist because he has had so many memorable songs during his career.  However, this 2-CD compilation is not good enough because I don't know who would want this (not to mention certain hits missing).  If you are a Stevie Wonder fan, then you probably have his 4-CD &quot;At The Close Of A Century&quot; so you don't need this.  If you are a casual fan, then the &quot;Definitive Collection&quot; is your best choice since it's one CD and enough songs to justify buying.  This collection is just too much for a casual fan.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|Lewis Carrol's \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" isn't so much fairytale as it is scathing political satire. That the novel just happens to feature such immortal characters as the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat was good for masking the author's real acidic read of the British aristocracy. In eschewing Carrol's original intent, Disney gives us spectacle without substance; a series of highly imaginative, magnificently rendered vignettes that, unfortunately fail to provide a cohesive plot for dear sweet Alice to meander through. At the time of its release \\"Alice\\" was much criticized for having omitted many of Carrol's best characters and the truncation of his best work in the novel, \\"the Jabberwacky\\" is a slight few die hard Carrol-philes have forgiven Disney for since. <BR>TRANSFER: In a word, stunning! A rich, fully saturated spectrum of color that is bold and well defined. While the previously issued DVD suffered from some picture instability and age related artifacts, this version is near pristine and to quote another Disney heroine, Mary Poppins, \\"practically perfect in every way\\". The audio has been cleaned up and remixed to 5.1 surround. The songs benefit richly from the remastering effort with robust spread across all five speaker channels that is quite uncharacteristic of most movies of \\"Alice's\\" vintage.<BR>EXTRAS: A ton. There's a Charlie McCarthy featurette, some studio junket stuff and a few short subjects that get introduced by Katharine Beaumont - the voice of Alice. There's also the Mickey Mouse short \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" which was previously made available on the 'Mickey in Living Color' DVD and a really, REALLY dismal virtual adventure in Wonderland that I can't imagine appealing to anyone outside of the pre-school set. One oversight: there's no comprehensive \\"making of\\" of this Disney film - a genuine shame that leaves the other extras sort of out in the cold, presented without any kind of overview and underlying unity - sort of like the film itself.<BR>BOTTOM LINE:If you've always been a fan of this movie this is definitely the version to get. For me, there's still something tragically lacking in \\"Alice\\" that not even a wonderland can make whole!
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder has had lots of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums, but none for a single disc from start (in 1962) to finish.  If you only want one CD of Stevie Wonder, then this is your best option.  However, if you already purchased his &quot;4 CD compilation&quot;, then you don't need this.  Highly recommended for just the casual fan.
B00009V8Z9|2.0|I heard parts of \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" performed on a TV show, and was intrigued by the appealing chorus and the jockeying of the verse against the bass line (what can I say? - I'm an easy mark for a catchy tune).  Curious, I decided I should get to know this band a little better and bought the CD.  Wow! What's all the fuss about?  Save for the excerpts of \\"Wanna Be . .\\" that I had heard previously, the songs on this album demonstrate very little.  They are familiar-sounding, folk-rock, or sleepy R & B numbers that allow DeGraw's admittedly pleasant, bluesy voice to ramble. Yet the compositions are not inventive, and the textures are not at all fresh (in the case of \\"More Than Anyone,\\" even plodding, as in dirge). Supposedly the girls melt for DeGraw's looks, but the listener is left cold, especially with lyrics like:  \\". . . I believe you're very fine; still I haven't got the time. . .\\" Give me a break! More of this sophomoric tripe inhabits the majority of the verses. Further, for all the promo about his piano playing, where was it? The selections are overwhelmingly dominated by guitar with barely a hint of keyboard work, most of which has been completely mixed down from the master, except for a few lead-ins or segues (which are also plodding). One playing reveals this has all been done before, and the hand of an expert producer can be detected occasionally in a chorus hook or a counter melody which has been meticulously woven into the fabric.  Those who claim this is a unique musical contribution should redefine their focus. In truth, this is actually nothing more than a well-packaged product for the pop market. (Clive Davis, it should be remembered, put his finger on this guy). Ben Folds and Billy Joel, for all their faults, at least composed some original material. As a singer, DeGraw shows promise, but as for the rest, there's not much that's distinctive here.[the 2 stars is changed from the rating of 3 - it gets more monotonous every time I hear it!]
B00003CXAA|5.0|Ok now theres no debating, The Godfather is the BEST movie of all time.  The Godfather Part II is the second best movie of all time.  Now thats out of the way these DVD's are outstanding.  The audio quality far surpasses that of the VHS.  And I'm going to buy a widescreen tv just so I can see it in widescreen.<BR>    Brando was amazing as the godfather.  But Micheal was more rutless.  These movies tell a tale of a large italian crime family and there ups and downs living in the US.  This includes \\"Hits\\", Gambeling rings, prostitution, and extortion.  Although brando never appears in 2 his presence is felt in the end scene.  If I could recommend two movies that everyone should see it would be the first two godfathers.  <BR>   In conclusion this movie is full of action and drama from beginning to end.  From Vito Making Johnny Woltz an offer he could'nt refuse, to fredos demise at the end of 2 no one trilogy of movies can top \\"The Godfather Trilogy\\"
0812548094|4.0|Okay, the dialoge between the charactures is not the best, and Richard does seem to have a way of getting out of every seemingly impossable situation (but then what kind of story would it be if he died in the first few chapters).  But all in all, it is a very good book, the charactures are likable and the story line is very intertaining.  I have allready orderd the third book and look forward to spending many late nights (and bleary eyed mornings) reading it!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|There is something hauntingly-comfortable about Sarah McLahlin's voice.  This album was definately worth the wait.  &quot;Push&quot; just couldn't be more *honest*!
0375703764|5.0|It's important to note that at the time of this writing I am only halfway through the book, but utterly enthralled.<BR>Fans of e.e. cummings will rejoice at the fantastic wordplay and utter avoidance of traditional structuring to be found in this novel? word-picture? primitive cuneiform using modern english?  The story follows a young, somewhat troubled man who discovers one of his neighbors has been laboring over a volume dissembling a fictional(?) documentary called &quot;the Navidson Record&quot;, named for the photojournalist Will Navidson, who with his wife Karen and their two children move into an unassuming, rather charming house on Ash Street.<BR>What follows is three, possibly four different stories all occuring in the same space.  Through voluminous footnotes that often exceed the length of the chapters it annotates, we see more of the young man, (whose name I can't recall at the moment), Zampano, the original writer of the treatise on the documentary, and Will and Karen Navidson's troubling encounter with the uncanny, the ultimately unknowable.<BR>The house is built over what is repeatedly referred to as &quot;the Labyrinth&quot;, and ultimately that is what the book symbolically represents, using the words on the page to wrap and warp and force the reader to navigate, as it's characters do, through its dark and twisting pathways.<BR>Cerebral and complex and amazingly disturbing in the most unexpected ways, this is a book that creeps up on you, wondering at times &quot;why am I bothering with this meandering narrative written by apparently extremely disturbed individuals?&quot; before sucking you back in with a seemingly completely unrelated tangent that tells more about the story then the entire &quot;record&quot; combined.<BR>As I said in the subject line, if you don't like thinking, or enjoy books with more substance and variance then anything on the market today, don't bother.  But if you want a verbal ride through the human mind, then read it.<BR>Read it now.
0312263120|3.0|This book is not bad. Some interesting ideas and twists. However, some concepts are unrealistic and left me saying, &quot;come on...that wouldn't really happen&quot;. I did learn a little about US Intelligence, which was nice. That being said, I was really disappointed how close this book was to becoming a love story.<BR>I think one would enjoy this book...just do not expect a masterpiece.
0375703764|1.0|-if you have time to read this review (not the book), I recommend it. It will save you money, and...  <br />and please remember that I am trying to be fair...<br />Summary: a self-obsessed substance abuser (Johnny) from LA finds a manuscript that a recently deceased old man left behind, almost finished. It tells of a documentary film about a house that gets bigger inside and swallows people up. Fair enough. <br />Johnny gets absorbed in the book and lets his life fall apart. The book is 'complsively' filled with footnotes to such an extent that most of the time we are reading ficticious footnotes about fictitious references to the ficticious film, and journal-entry footnotes describing johnny's screwed-up fictitious life in LA. Sound interesting? It is. For about the first twenty pages. <br />Groan... the author has tried to create a fiction around the book, to create a buzz, with fictions such as: <br />- it was distributed as a stack of loose typewritten pages,<BR>- people studied it, people read it. <BR>- people liked it. <br />for many that may be enough to make them think it IS good. not for those who never forget that they could be reading something better. Nevertheless, I always give an author a chance to change my mind, and I read it through. I even enjoyed bits. Especially that house theme. But...<br />before I get too in too deep like the author himself and his characters, allow me to mention that the book binding is inadequate and it WILL be reduced to a stack of loose leaves in a week. Is this by design? Maybe. Or maybe because the book which could have been good at 200 pages, was filled out to over 700 pages, with lists of made up names, blank pages, x's and o's, anything to give it the illusion of disorder, with the following results:<br />a. the interesting plot inside, which at least could be made into an interesting movie, is buried by the book's lack of economy or taste. The novel's finer points are reduced to a sad footnote to poor craftmanship. it's attempts to exhalt itself seem feeble - &quot;this book will change your life.&quot; sorry, but it won't.<br />phony references are clever up to a point. till they get too boring, lists of names and nonsense. should the excessive and bizarre be mistaken for an indication of genius? I don't think so. <br />the often-absent narrator, johnny truant, loves the fact that he is a twisted information dumpster. but in his tedious waste of paper we find just what we might expect in a dumpster.<BR> <BR>really, garbage is called garbage (and not art) for a reason.<br />b. like a fortune cookie fortune in a dumpster, there are some fine sentiments expressed in the book, but it's too much to ask the reader to sift through and rinse it off, after neither author or editor could be bothered to do it. <br />for all his attempts to stretch the medium of the printed word, he only goes to show how powerful the print medium IS. powerful enough to regurgitate his attempts to embelish it with wasted space and ficticious appendices.<br />c. appendices - for all the babble about the power of the manipulated image, all there are in the appendices are a single page of unintriguing photos of some home exteriors and some grainy pictures of some 'spooky' crap modeled  upon the opening sequence of the movie, 'seven'. <br />seeing that he had his character snapping pictures at an insane rate, he could have at least pretended to include some and created a sense of authenticity. but what he ends up with is about as realistic as the blair witch project, which the behavior of his characters somehow resembles.<br />summary: <br />for all the talk of &quot;space&quot;, this book lacks any. the numerous empty pages with single words or sentances say one thing:<br />   !!This book is an environmental disaster!!<br />thanks for managing a book that uses up twice the paper as neccesary. trying to look unedited is no excuse for being poorly edited. <br />         promising plot hijacked by sorry concept.<BR>           <BR>        publisher should be charged for negligence.<br />Do the earth a favor. wait for the movie.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love Actually is a wonderful movie in all respects.  Its cast, script, and direction are all absolutely top-notch.  Set at Christmastime, the story encompasses numerous plots, all of which are equally interesting and effective in leaving one on the edge of one's seat, waiting to see what's going to happen with each group of characters next.  <br />One of the most wonderful aspects of the film, in my opinion, is how we eventually discover that every single one of the vignettes is interwoven.  For example: one story is about Karen (Emma Thompson) and her husband (Alan Rickman).  The latter, although certainly not without affection for his wife, has begun to dabble in infidelity - thanks to his attractive secretary.  Working with Rickman's character is Sarah (Laura Linney) who has been desperately in love with her co-worker Karl (unfortunately, I can't recall the actor's name, but he does a nice job) for years.  And then of coure there's David, the prime minister (Hugh Grant) - who just happens to be Karen's brother.<br />Wonderful performances are also given by Liam Neeson (as a recent widower), 13-year-old Thomas Sangster (as Neeson's young son), Rowan Atkinson (who does a hilarious job as Rufus the Jewelry Salesman), and in one of the best vignettes, my personal favorite, Colin Firth. <br />This is an extremely funny and extremely touching movie.  As usual, I hesitate to give away too much more about it.  Nothing, and I repeat, NOTHING, should deter you from seeing it.
0316666343|5.0|Shortly after this book was released I read a snippet concerning it in my local paper and I knew I had to read it.  I bought in in the morning finished it by nightfall and then proceded to immediatly reread it.  Within the first paragraph I was hooked, it's the type of book that is hard to describe you simply must read it for yourself.  A book that when you read it you feel as though you have a slight knot in your stomach and then by the end you feel like a warmth has passed over you and you are possibly slightly wiser for having read it (possibly somehow mirroring susie's own journey). While some might see Susie's experiences as fantastical I went along for the ride never doubting for a second that it was all a possibility.  Alice Sebold has written a beautiful, touching, elegent book...a book that I hope doesn't fade too fast....this is the type of book that twenty years from now I would like my children to read...it helps you if you are willing see life for what it is a gift made up of thousands of small gifts, while reading you mourn for susie not because of the physicality of her death but because of the &quot;could have been&quot; of it, the moments that are huge when your a fourteen year old girl but somehow thirty years later they simply only become faint memories that make you smile, or cry or even laugh....but here we are faced with a character who will always be the same age, her first kiss will come long after her death, her life will have ended but in a way she continues to live...Hmmm...perhaps this review doesn't make much sense, but that is simply because I believe that this book stirs up personal feelings in the majority of people who read it and it is simply something that must be experienced to be understood.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is one of the most creative musicals created in cinema history.  It deservingly garnered eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, winning two.  Baz Luhrmann created his best work in his directing career.  The plot is only one of many movie details that makes it so spectacular.  Its remakes of classic songs from the mid to late 1900's have a new creative musical flavor that pleases audiences, though the film takes place in 1899-1900.  Its clever writing in a style of a stage play makes it more enjoyable.  Besides them, its theme of forbidden love found in Moulin Rouge, a French night club, contains many unique twists and turns.  As Sadine's fiance begins suspecting about her relationship with Christian, the threat of disaster arises, keeping audiences interested.  Sadine's yearning for a happier life away from Paris and with Christian adds interesting dramatic flavors to the plot.  However, there's a catch.  Sadine has tuberculosis (there was no cure in 1899).  She must act upon her dreams soon; otherwise, she'll die before experiencing happiness.<br />Nicole Kidman's breakthrough role as a serious actress started in her role as Sadine.  She deservingly earned a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her great efforts.  No other could have performed Sadine better.  Kidman's singing voice is incredible, considering before accepting the role, she had no singing ability.  Ewan McGregor also amazes audiences with his role as Christian.  His charm and his romantic side are very convincing, which adds his own unique interesting flavor to the film.  Kidman And McGregor's chemistry as performers are perfect.  All other actors, major or minor, also performed beautifully: Jim Broadbent, Kylie Minogue, and many more.<br />The elaborate Oscar winning costume design and the art direction are very marvelous.  Such hard work paid off, offering audiences a more spectacular reaction.  Therefore, it's more than just computer effects that made the art more realistic-looking.  The camera effects and the editing offer their own perspectives as they further shine the colors, attracting bigger audiences.  <br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a great movie for those looking for something highly unique.  This is great for fans of musicals.  However, this film may create musical fans.  This will surely entertain many audiences and keep them dancing and singing for a long time.  The bonus features offer an interesting look at the making and the history of this film, including interviews, behind-the-scenes, the studio recordings, and more. <br />Fans of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; are also recommended movies &quot;Chicago&quot; and &quot;Evita&quot;.  Such combination will add more spark to this unforgettable experience.  Those looking to hear more of Nicole Kidman's newfound music should buy Robbie William's album &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; (an import and not to be confused with his US release &quot;Sing ...&quot;, notice the missing &quot;w&quot;).  It includes a duet he recorded with Kidman, &quot;Something Stupid&quot;, which reached #1 on the UK Billboard Top 100 Singles charts in 2001.
B00000099Y|5.0|We can make this as difficult or as easy as you want to here.  Let's go simple. If you don't have the ability to develop an original thought of your own....  TOOL is NOT for you.  If you have the attention span of an 8 year old....  TOOL is NOT for you.  If you are blinded by the ideals of a decaying society.... TOOL is NOT for you.   IF you are only into love at first listen.... TOOL is NOT for you.  Tool is like a good movie:  The more times you watch it, the more you see and understand.  You can't sit down and listen to tool with preconceived ideals.  You can't listen to tool with a closed mind.  Hell, you can't even listen to tool and take them seriously.  Tool is all about not letting anybody tell you how to think.  Including them.  Sit back, draw the world in for yourself, and develop an original thought of your own.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is one of my favorite Death releases. To me, it's a little better than \\"Leprosy\\" but second to the masterpieces \\"Individual thought patterns\\" and \\"Symbolic\\". What sets Chuck Schuldiner's fourth album apart from his earlier work is the high level of technical proficiency. Also, this album has more melody than say, \\"Scream bloody gore\\". The lyrics to these songs are even more thoughtful than on previous albums as they deal with the struggle that is being Human rather than say, Deicide's mindless Christ raping lyrics or Cannibal corpse's banal pornographic ramblings. The best Death metal lyrics are those that are a reflection of Human emotions and struggles. Chuck knew that. Highly recommended.
B000127LW2|5.0|A Long Long time ago in a place not so far away we had a series in the late 60's that changed the world & history. Yes Yes we have Naval Ships  & Even a space shuttle named after the great enterprize. <br /> It took thirty years to do it again ! But voyager was the event that Sci Fi Fans world wide were waiting for. <br /> In the mid 60's Star trek pushed the limits of racial acceptance and the place of women in the future... All those Decades ago we had Nichelle Nichols, an african american woman in a major role in a popular TV Series.<br /> Finally in the 90's UPN got so bold as to do it again. A FEMALE STARSHIP CAPTIN! It was a longshot , espescialy when we had just been so spoiled with Patrick Stewart playing Picard for 7 years! <br /> Kate Mulgrew & her cast seemed to steal our hearts with original Charecters & Stories that followed true to the Star trek beginnings. <br /> Season one sets up a plot that many never figured would ever work . It broke away from the safety of starfleet's turf, and created a new concept. Leaving behind the squables with the Romulans & The over acted charectors like DuKat , it created it's own crew, it's own adventure, and left just enough of the classic style of trek to impress us all . Bringing us the ever ornary & comical doctor , the Curvy 7 of 9 , the tempersome half klingon b'lanna to name a few as well as hundreds of cameo's over the years no one can say this series was boring... OR un related to its predecesors.( HEY Deanna & Barkley even appeared in this one! ) <br /> And Let's not forget Our favourate friends the borg ... after all Picard picked the fight with them ... but it took Janeway to finish it. ( For more info see season 7) <BR> <BR>Aside from the fact that the real voyager is still sending back data about the universe arround us to this day , I think it will be a very long time before we see the pinache of Janeway ever again.
0671688782|5.0|Words cannot express my gratitude to Dr. Welch for Holding Time. Since using it, my adopted 8 year old's spirit is buoyant and her eyes twinkle again. Her laughter and songs have begun to fill the house. She still gets upset with characteristic passion, but we move through it together and much more quickly now. <br />I recognize the work I have to do in connecting with my feelings so that I can meet her at a heart level. It's also become very clear to me that this work is not only crucial for mothering a child with attachment problems, but also for a mother to fulfill her true commission here on earth. <br />The Lord gave Dr. Welch a special gift, that she now shares with so many. She has developed the art of shepherding lost mothers and children back to a place of heart connection in a world dominated by the mind. Blessings to you, Martha, and to your life's work.
B000092Q4U|5.0|\\"I love bands like these, January 9, 2004 <BR> Reviewer: A music fan from NYC, NY  <BR>Call it what you will...extreme thrash, death metal, speed metal, grindcore...one thing is common among all these genres that Lamb Of God mix together. The lyrics are absolutely indecipherable from beginning to end.<br />***(A true metal head can understand every word in this album)***<br />I don't know if anybody is actually scared by all this growling (I know that's the intent), but I for one think it's the funniest thing ever. I'm glad to know that if I ever were transformed into a grizzly bear, I could still get a job singing with a metal band.<br />***( The intent is not fear..brainchild, it is the genre of music. If you know metal at all, they have been growling since the 80's and we understand them just fine)***<br />Imagine if these guys sounded like this in your everyday person-to-person communicating:<br />\\"Thank you for choosing MacDonald's.

B0000UJL96|5.0|Let me explain<br />-Spoiler Warning-<br />The first version of the film was shown in theaters.<br />The second version was shown on all home video formats. This version includes a couple of additional footage to certain key scenes, and a few new scenes all together. <BR>- Spock has more Dialogue in the top brass meeting.<BR>- A scene taking place in the President's office where Col. West presents his plan to sneak into Klingon territory and rescue Kirk and McCoy.<BR>- Spock and Scotty checking the torpedo inventory before Valeris informs them that the Chancellor's Daughter is now the current klingon chancellor.<BR>- The klingon assassin at the climax of the film turns out to be Col. West.<br />The Third version of the film is shown on this Special Collector's Edition DVD. This version includes all the material from the second version, and a few minor changes to certain scenes and effects.<BR>- When Martia gets shot, a disruption sound effect is removed to make her scream more apparent.<BR>- Valeris's interrogation scene has been entirely reedited. There are now close up shots of Kirk and McCoy when they speak their lines instead of being in wide shots. When Spock and Valeris name a particular conspirator, the face of that person briefly appears in a flashback like style.<br />Do I prefer this version of the film? Sure. I personally believe that Valeris's interrogation scene is much more dramatic with the flashback shots. It really helps the viewers who aren't good with names understand who Spock and Valeris are talking about, and adds a little more tension near the end of the film.<br />I hoped this information helps you out in spotting what has been changed. If there is anything I missed, please feel free to contact me.
B00013PHGS|5.0|Air has done it again with their album Talkie Walkie. An excellent mix of the signature sounds of Air. Using the sweet sounding melody styles of Moon Safari and Les Prof., yet mixed with the excellent and unique sound of 10,000 Legend. This CD is another stroke of brilliance by Dunckel and Goodin displaying their amazing songwriting abilities.<br />This album is marked for sucess without a doubt. It's dreamy sound will appeal to those who are looking for the sounds of Moon Safari. However the styles reflect a bit of 10,000 Legend, which some did not respond to, but I believe was a brilliant piece of work. Plus there is the added bonus of hearing Dunckel and Goodin handling vocals themselves, which adds a whole other element of beauty to the already fabulous music of Air!
B0000027RL|2.0|Pearl Jam was once called the Rolling Stones of the 1990's grunge movement.  They even made the cover of Time magazine after \\"Ten\\" had been out for a while.  The AMG and Rolling Stone have rated \\"Ten\\" a five star album and it's at the top of many lists of critically acclaimed albums.  However, it's not all that impressive.<BR>\\"Ten\\" is an extremely polished album in terms of production.  The album sounds over polished taking away any type of grunge feel it may have had.  It's possible Epic may have spent time making sure the album had a pop rock feeling to it and possibly even rewriting the songs.  If Pearl Jam did have punk influences it doesn't show.  It's definitely not a grunge album, but it is pop rock.<BR>Musically, \\"Ten\\" is a tribute to classic rock like Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix.  That throws out any hope for originality.  The musicians do play 1970's style rock more energetically, but some thing seems to be missing.  When they play complicated melodies to quickly it lacks a lasting impact.  The bouncy, upbeat of most songs also takes away from the serious lyrical themes making it kind of awkward.<BR>The lyrical content is political overkill.  While the lyrics definitely won Pearl Jam praise from the critics and fans, it's just too hard to take seriously.  I like the lyrics to \\"Jeremy\\" but when Vedder goes \\"whoooooo\\" and \\"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi yeah\\", it just destroys the song.  Vedder's voice is way to warm to convey any angst at all.  \\"Ten\\" would've been better off as a mindless party album.<BR>Kurt Cobain called Pearl Jam \\"a corporate rock\\" band even though that was extremely hypocritical to say.  They tried to go back and earn their alternative credibility after releasing a pop album as the Beastie Boys and Beck.  Vedder even became a Fugazi worshipper and took control of the band which led to no more music videos and declining record sales.  That makes them a little more respectable even though their new direction turned out mediocre music.  However, it wasbetter than the music on \\"Ten\\".
0375432302|2.0|A great premise and fascinating historical religious esoterica are married to a pedestrian mystery and monochromatic and predictable characters.  Brown is what Harlan Ellison would call an &quot;author&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;writer&quot;.  He is capable of producing easily digestible, and therefore popular material, but his work has no literary merit.  A typical MTV attention span is ideal for optimum enjoyment.  This would actually be a good beach/airplane read.  The reading experience would be enhanced by crying babies, people noisily noshing cheap peanuts and occasional turbulence induced nausea.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Two hours ago, I was not a Pink Floyd fan.  <BR>Since before I was born over 24 years ago, my parents had a deep affinity for Floyd, and I don't remember them ever playing any records as often as DSOTM, The Wall, and Animals.  By the time I was four, The Wall was my favorite album, although the artwork on the inside of the sleeve provided me many a nightmare at the time.  So I've loved PF pretty much all my life.<BR>But two hours ago, I was not a Pink Floyd fan. Sure, I thought their concerts were great, their music, everything, was fantastic.  But I never thought of them as people, and that's what this DVD showed me. <BR>All the personality injected into this album, all the ideas, backstories, bells and whistles have never been more clear after watching this DVD.  I must have listened to DSOTM literally hundreds of times in my lifetime, in open spaces, with good noise canceling headphones, you name it, and every so often I still hear new things.  Well, this DVD kind of spoiled everything, because now there's nothing more to discover.  Every minor detail is covered, sonically and lyrically, and after watching the DVD, the album is fresh once again, imagine that.  I have a new respect for the album and the band as a whole.  Well made documentary, some clips of their videos thrown in here and there, some old footage, but mostly more recent footage of interviews and such.  <BR>This is so worth it, especially to watch Gilmour play, it's amazing to see that in over 30 years, he still has it. Beautiful.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|This is the first Simply Red album I have purchased since &quot;Stars&quot;, one of my all-time favorite 80ies albums, and this one is a worthy successor. Mick's voice has lost none of its power, and if it is a little gruff around the edges, it does not hurt. Simply Red have clearly branched out as far as their style goes, but they still maintain their signature sound. In addition to great original songs like &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot; there a couple of very skilled covers on this album, most notably Bob Dylan's &quot;positively 4th street&quot; that is done extremely well. A couple of songs have female backing vocals that are reminiscent in quality only of the great Steely Dan songs but sort of used with a twist. Overall a very well-rounded and memorable album that one can listen to for a long time
0688101364|5.0|I love this book, too, even though mine is in pieces. The problem with the buttercrunch is this: Once it comes to the boil, you must use a clean spoon each time you stir. I don't stir it often at that point, but when I do, I use a new spoon. If there is any sugar on the spoon, the whole thing will crystallize.
0743216458|4.0|An amazing read, much better than the series, if you can believe it.  Some maps of Normandy, Market garder, &amp; the Bulge would have been a huge help.  Otherwise, I found this to be a fantastic book.
B000002UA5|3.0|I remember when I purchased Pink Floyd's Ummagumma on vinyl. It was very disappointing. The album sleeves caught my attention. I also thought that I was getting a real good deal because you were getting an extra LP an no extra cost. I liked the infinity concept in the front and a display of musical instruments in the back of the sleeve. It reminded me of a jet fighter displaying its armenments. It looked like they were a very talented band. The kettle drums really stand out. I like quality music and as I mentioned, it was very disappointing. I hated it! However, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it! Grantchester Meadows is my favorite track on the album and perhaps my favorite Pink Floyd track. Dave Gilmour's Narrow Way is not bad but Part II is disasterous. Rick Write's Sysphus is not bad in the beginning however he gets bored and just hammers out any note. The live album is o.k.
B00000729S|5.0|This album isn't so much ahead of its time as out of any time entirely.  When I first heard it, my first thought was, &quot;Who was this music made for?&quot;  It seems to be created without any thought to commerical viability whatsoever.  And this was the mid 1960s, when even the Beatles' mildly long haircuts were considered radical and freakish.  The Monks redefined &quot;freakish&quot; before it was even properly defined in the first place!  Out of all the footnotes to 60s garage rock, The Monks are perhaps the most original of them all.  NOBODY were writing pop songs with lyrics such as &quot;I hate you with a passion baby&quot; in the mid-60s... not even Bob Dylan.  The Monks' world are their own... this music includes all the elements of 60s beat music but it's put together so differently... like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing, replaced with complete lunacy.  I can only imagine the Germans were thinking when they listened to this stuff.  I'd like to interview some of them.  If you're reading this review now, buy this album.  I don't care if you don't own a single 60s record, or claim to be a Michael Bolton fan... this curio can't be ignored... it's a circus freak of an album.  Worth the import price.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I first heard this album at work off an iTunes share. I had no idea who these guys were. The first 2 tracks will slowly aclimate you with the album. They are beautiful, quirky, and ambient. Track 3 gets pretty emotional and reflective. The piano line is haunting and intense. Track 4 is - for lack of a better description - probably the apex of all the musical experiences in my life. I was quite literally crying uncontrollably halfway through this song, out of nowhere. This album is a vocalist singing absolute jibberish according to what the music does to him. I don't think it's possible to communicate any more clearly than that. (if that makes sense). This album is a miracle.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Spotlight hungry Roxie Hart (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) dreams of a life on the stage and spends her nights jazzing it up in the bright lights of Chicago, continually hoping that she'll find her lucky break.  In awe of seductive club singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Roxie meets Fred Cassely a man who convinces her he can 'make her showbiz career take off'. However after Roxie has undergone the 'casting couch' treatment, and Fred has had his  way with her, he reveals that he has no connections in showbusiness.  She shoots Fred Cassely and kills him.  Upon discovering that he had an affair, Roxie's husband Amos refuses to take the blame for the murder and Roxie is sent to jail.  In jail she finally meets Velma Kelly, currently receiving huge media attention for the double murder she committed earlier in the tale.  The prison Warden Mrs Morton (Queen Latifah) offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Billy is more a showbiz P.R agent than a legal lawyer and manipulates the tabloids into thinking Roxie is no more than an innocent 'good time girl' who took the wrong path, than a scheming murderess. The tabloids go crazy for the new girl on the cell block and Roxie finally becomes a star.<br />The storyline in this movie was ok but the singing and dancing was amazing!  Catherine Zeta Jones' opening number was the best I've seen.  The choreography in this movie will blow you away.
B0000U5RNU|5.0|Move over Roger Moore and Sean Connery, Johny English is taking over. With the debonair of a true gentleman, Mr. Bean, I mean Johny joins forces with Bob and a hot little British tart. Together they thwart a Frenchmen's attempt to become King of England and transform the entire island into a prison for the world's criminals.<br />Johny helplessly bumbles his way through this movie as only he can. A high speed chase through the streets of London between a hearse and a tow truck, the take over of a hospital and its innocent patients, a five story climb up a sewer pipe leading directly to a bum troff, and finally being crowned King himself!<br />It must be hard to be a secret agent, you have to keep track of your truth serum and knockout gas, the knowledge to correctly assemble your sidearm, and most of all you must know who is an imposter and who is not. If you claim that a man has `Jesus is coming...look busy' tattooed across his bum, you better be sure.<br />The best British humor since Benny Hill.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I dont see why so many people liked this movie maybe because they have bad taste. Let me see there was no plot and extremly boring I fell asleep! I cant believe this won awards it was a lousy movie. An it wasnt even funny maybe one or 2 lines at most. This movie should be up there with the worst movies like Gigli.Its 2 people wondering around Tokyo...wow how exciting. Ive been to Tokyo an I sure didnt spend my time wondering around complainin how lonely I am an I didnt have anyone at the time. I think critics are bein nice to this movie because it has Bill Murray in it.
0784010501|1.0|It's a good thing Madonna has so many sheep-like fans who pay for her to live in her own fantasy world where she is important. An hour and a half of self-delusion is enough for even the most rabid fan. The gay dancer isn't even in the 'human being' category, humans have backbones if I remember my biology correctly. With over the top stage performances with the males wearing the traffic cone bras, to seeing guys French kiss each other, this has it all. Sure Madonna flashes the camera, but only after she announces that her father used to get in bed with her at night and have sex.<br />The last five minutes is a tribute of hilarity. Madonna is walking around in seclusion as a narrator announces how 'deep' and 'how dedicated to her art' she is.<br />This was nothing more than Madonna pumping up her ego. The parody was better, check out Julie Brown's 'Medusa'.
0156027321|4.0|Were you ever made fun of as a child?  Did anyone ever make fun of your name?  Does your name sound like pissing?  Welcome to the young life of Piscine Molitor Patel, the character so craftily created by Yann Martel in the book Life of Pi.  Piscine is a young boy growing up on a zoo in India.  He faces the normal teenage struggles of religion and self worth.  Piscine, who changes his social name to Pi, struggles through 227 days in the Pacific Ocean on a boat with four animals after the ship his family and zoo animals were traveling on sunk.  Yann uses Pi, clever structure, religion, and belief to convey his underlying message in this work of fiction. <BR> Martel uses an interesting structure for this well engineered piece of fiction.  He inserts certain chapters written in italics.  These chapters contain his thoughts on his `interviews' with Pi.  The personal insights not only give the reader a sense of reality, but also give the reader another perspective on Pi's first person narrative.  Early in the novel, in an italicized chapter, the author writes, \\"`Dad! The writer's here'[Pi's son speaking]... `That was your son?' I ask, incredulous.  `Yes.'  To acknowledge the fact brings a smile to his lips.\\"  The short meetings with the Pi of the present allow the reader to not only appreciate that Pi is a normal, healthy family man, but also force the reader to personally connect with the character.<BR> Pi, while a young, innocent, teenage boy, practices three religions.  He believes, `The presence of God is the finest of rewards.'  Pi just wants to worship God in any way he possibly can.  He says, `Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.\\" Pi asks, \\"If there's only one nation in the sky, shouldn't all passports be valid for it?\\"  According to one character, this book is supposed to make you believe in God.  Throughout the journey, Pi is tested again and again.  It may not make convert you into a faith, but it sure will make you believe in something.  There has to be hope, luck, and miracles to allow a young cunning boy to overcome a tiger, storms, an estranged man, and a cannibalistic island.<BR> Chapters 21 and 22 are supposedly the core of the novel.  These chapters insist that it is better to believe in something than be undecided.  In chapter 22 Yann writes, <BR> \\"I can well imagine an atheist's last words: \\"White, white! L-L-Love!  My  God!\\"-and the deathbed leap of faith.  Whereas the agnostic, if he stays  true to his reasonable self, if he stays beholden to dry, yeast-less  factuality, mighty try and explain the warm light bathing him by saying,  \\"Possibly a f-f-falling oxygenation of the b-b-brain,\\" and, to the very end,  lack imagination and miss the better story.\\"<BR>Yann finishes the novel with a second disturbing yet brilliant account of the journey using human characters.  Pi asks the non-trusting interviewers, `Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?'  Martel's account of the second story backs up his primary purpose proposed in Chapter 22.  Both stories are factually true, but which one is better?  Has more imagination?  The one who believes is the one who will live the more rewarding, yet dangerous life with the tigers and meerkats.<BR> The second, short, chilling description of the journey throws the reader off guard.  It is a gory, alarming account of a story that follows the facts.  Which one is true?  Martel puts the reader on the spot.  The reader, like the interviewers, must immediately choose the story he or she believes.  If not, the reader is left like the agnostic, not knowing and wondering.  Martel forces the reader into a tough situation that I myself found particularly troublesome.<BR> Life of Pi is a crafty piece of fiction that erupts like a tiger in a bad situation.  In Skating to Antarctica,Jenny Diski writes, \\"There are infinite ways of telling the truth, including fiction, and infinite way of evading the truth, including non-fiction\\" (229).  Martel creates truth out of fiction.  This book, through the touching characters, the first person narratives, and the witty writer interviewee interjections creates meaning and connectability for the reader that only truth can achieve.  This piece is considered fiction, but may actually need to be put in a genre all by itself: true fiction.<BR> Martel's earlier work, as he claims in his note from the author, was an utter failure.  He claims it left critics wondering and that readers disregarded it.  His earlier works Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios and Self focused on man's interpersonal struggles with relationships, creation, and the human experience (\\"Yann...\\").  These works of fiction made the reader want to interact with the characters just as in Life of Pi.  Martel's earlier themes of interpersonal struggle continue in Life of Pi, but he focuses mainly on the journey to believe. <BR> I am normally only an enthusiast of non-fiction books that I can relate the characters' experiences.  This book made me realize the pleasures of fiction and placed a new soft spot in me for Martel's intense, but tactful writing.  I would recommend this book to all ages.  It can provide just an action packed adventure for leisure reading or it can provide insight for any human wanting to believe.<BR>As Pi says, \\"Only fear can defeat life.\\"  So go read Life of Pi and never stop believing in something.
B00005AQE8|5.0|this is the best rap cd of all time.  I own over 2000 cd's and i am a dj and i can honestly claim that this is the best rap cd of all time.  2pac is a legend and he will be forever missed, but his messages will continue to spread through his music.  He has sold the most hip-hop cd's ever period, and for those who don't know he is number 32 on the all-time list.

0719062683|5.0|This is the fourth or fifth &quot;introduction&quot; on literary theory that I have read, and I wish I had read it first!  Barry does an excellent job of making clear a subject frequently riddled by difficult neologisms.  The best entry point to the entire topic of literary and cultural theory, and one which covers all the major variations, including stylistics.
B000000OSG|4.0|Lemme start by saying I'm a huge GnR fan and always have been . This album is great , not incredile ala Appetite only because it lacks that rawness and anger that AFD had . The songs are all very unique and the band's range is truly on display here going from the Stonesesque 14 years to the vicious punk-like Shotgun Blues and the Epic Estranged . This is really the only GnR album that has true clunkers on it , My World and Get in the Ring ( which is actually not horrible ) , anyway The best two songs off this effort are - Civil War and Pretty Tied Up . Intresting note - Steven Adler the band's original drummer lays down the drums on Civil War on this album then Sorum takes over , anyway if you're a Hard Rock fan pick this album up , you'll be glad ya did .
0156027321|5.0|Sometimes books categorized as Others just fulfilled your craving for something new and relatively unheard of. As a Muslim I know my religion and a lot of Christianity too and I found the writer has gone to a great lenght to ensure the accuracy of the facts about Islam and Christianity. <BR>It's hard actual to have some inter-faith talk like Pi encountered and I found it refreshing to read about what I as a Muslim perceive other religions and people from other faith perceive mine.<BR>In Malaysia,faith and religion are very sensitive issue. We rarely talk about them openly thus preventing us from knowing and understanding each other. Life of Pi has deepened my believe in God and also how we can live a harmonious life with each other with God will
B00000EZTQ|4.0|this  is  the  1981  follow-up  to  the  1978  classic.  John  Carpenter  co-writes ,  co-produces  but  doesn't  direct.  this  film  could  have  been  better  if  Carpenter  had  decided  to  direct  it.  there  were  rumors  that  Carpenter  did  direct  a  few  scenes  but  he  has  regularly  denied  it.  (Jamie  Lee  Curtis)  returns  as  laurie.  michael  myers  is  played  by  (Dick  Warlock  who  is  the  best  and  scariest  micheal  myers  of  them  all.  (Donald  Pleasence)  reprises  his role  as  Dr.  Loomis.  Warlock  follows  Curtis  to  the  small  local  hospital  where  she  is  taken  for  treatment.  the  hospital  is  only  occupied  by  one  security  officer ,  one  doctor  and  a  few  nurses  including  (Tawny  Moyer)  and  (Pamela  Susan  Shoop)  and  two  ambulance  workers (Lance  Guest)  and  (Leo  Rossi).  the  films  atmosphere  is  creepy  with  Warlock  roaming  the  nearly  empty  hospital  and  the  suspense  really  picks  up  when  Warlock  and  Curtis  meet  up  towards  the  end  of  the  film.  this  film  is  not  as  good  as  the  original  (but  how  many  sequels  ever  are?).  Halloween  2  is  good  and  IT'S  THE  ONLY  SEQUEL  THAT'S  WORTH  WATCHING  AT  ALL.
B000002MFN|5.0|Long before pop stars realized that sex and controversy could make albums sell, Madonna released the risky early '90s dance album, Erotica. It was one of the most controversial and criticized eras of her career (American Life runs a close second).  About every ten years, Madonna has to get her philosophy out there as much as she can. Of all her albums, I would say Erotica and American Life are her two masterpieces, simply because they were the most daring, socially relevant, and unforgettable pieces of art she ever created.  <br />Another aspect of Erotica that makes it quite interesting is the era. The early '90s found Madonna in a period of transition. No longer the younger Madonna of Like a Virgin, and yet to reach the maturity of her later albums, Erotica has elements of both eras.  It is both an album of love ballads and an album of highly charged, sexy dance music. In between, there are a few songs like In This Life and Why's It So Hard that possess important social themes. Also vital to the overall power of Erotica are the videos - some of the best of her career. <br />An album that would have been much more appropriately titled, \\"Goodbye to Innocence,\\" Erotica is nonetheless a fascinating work that speaks of sex...but usually in the context of love. Rarely in a promiscuous way, except in the case of \\"Did You do it?\\" which is pure irony that no one seems to understand.  While Madonna is Waiting for the boy she thought loved her, the song sheds light on his lack of moral character. It is meant to be brutal and vulgar - she is showing us the other side of the situation.. Like Madonna has always said, \\"I do not endorse a lifestyle. I describe one.\\"  That is what she so brilliantly does here.<br />Far ahead of its time, and sometimes beyond the closed minds of its listeners, Erotica is one of Madonna's greatest and most misunderstood albums.
B000084T18|4.0|This album is worth the $10.99 Amazon is charging for it. 50 Cent didn't just make 1 bangin track &quot;IN DA CLUB&quot; &amp; the rest of the album junk. Most, if not all of the tracks on the cd are decent. I hate buying cd's with 1 stand-out track &amp; the rest is booty. I'm not that interested in G-Unit crew however. When is 50's next album????
B00004STUL|1.0|Hard to believe the reviews praising this worthless rag. For me, the jokes arent funny save one or two, the story is incredibly stupid, and unbelievable, the acting is phoned in (Will Smith,shame on you.Your better than this), and most of all the editing sucks.<BR>    Other than that I guess its a great movie.<BR>  Bay turned in great works with \\"Armageddon\\",and \\"Pearl Harbor\\",but this one is a real stinker.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|This was definitely on my list of the worst films of 2003. A boring monster flick starring Kate Beckinsale (who really is a good actress and should have known better), this movie is ostensibly about an age-old conflict between vampires and werewolves. Instead, it's a remarkably tired and predictable plot that exists mainly as an excuse to show Beckinsale in tight leather. The dialogue is awful, the storyline (ooooh, what a big mystery) was obvious from the first frame, and the climactic battle scene relied on one of those movie moments that's so ridiculous you feel compelled to shout out, &quot;Oh, COME ON!&quot; in the middle of the movie theater. To be fair, Bill Nighy did make a suitably creepy villain, but he deserved a better movie to do it in. Pass on this flick and rent one of the movies it tried to rip off -- &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade.&quot; Both of them are far more worthy of your time.
B00005JLZN|2.0|The DVD is a good transfer with decent sound. The &quot;extras&quot; are worth watching.  <br />That said, I generally agree with most of the other comments posted here.  The story-line doesn't work.  There is a plot &quot;device&quot; right in the beginning:  Winslet's rental car breaks down.  This &quot;device&quot; is then used at the end when her rental car breaks down just when David Gale is being strapped down and the needle installed.  Winslet has to run about two miles and arrives too late to save Gale.  Hokey, but it works, sort-of.  But a plot device all the same, and audiences are far too smart not to recognize them.<br />I do agree with one reviewer that the final scene just doesn't justify everything that has gone before.  When we see Gale step before the camera and look down at the dead woman, and then look into the camera with a dull expression, we are asked to believe that this brilliant college professor is really nothing more than a drunk and a dullard.  All of his dialog in the prison telling his tale shows us a man of extraordinary mental accumen.<br />The central performances are ok, but I always enjoy the acting of the supporting players, such as the prison warden who shows Kate Winslet into the prison.  He gave a touch of reality that the main players often had trouble recreating.<br />I'm not sure I get the point of this story.  At this point, I'm tempted to quote Rhett Butler:  &quot;Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.&quot;
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I only listen to half of the album ! I hate myself.. I do love Sarah's previous works SO MUCH (I got each and every cd she has released).. is there something wrong with me ?!<BR>I think the album is much more like Surfacing and less like FTE (which is her best album in my opinion).. regarding melody, u could almost match some pairs of afterglow and Surfacing's songs, the less upbeat songs are sort of boring *hides behind sofa*. lyrics are still dark and mysterious.. charming. generally, a change is desperately needed.<BR>However, SHE SHINES WITH A MASTERPIECE CALLED &quot;TIME&quot;. I guess it's enough a good reason to get the album.
1401300901|5.0|I loved this novel. I've recommended it to all my friends and my mother and mother-in-law, knowing that no matter what age they are and what their taste is, that they will love this book. The heroine is so much like me or any of my friends, and I could so relate to what she was going through. It's sweet, sad, romantic, and funny. Really the perfect novel. I haven't been so completely satisfied by a book in a really, really long time. Usually there's some part that doesn't quite ring true, or maybe you don't like the ending, or something else, but I loved this from beginning to end. And I was sorry it was over!

B00006RINF|5.0|You can slap a lable on any band and call them goth, if the clothing backs up the lable. Lacuna Coil, however, earned the title.  When you first take a chance and listen to this band, you will be astonished.  Cristina Scabbia has a voice, an enchanting voice that can not be beat.  <BR>Looks are a big part of the music, for some reason.  I have never figured that one out.  Cristina is a beautiful person.  With make-up and gothic attire or with naturality.  This woman can pull off anything.  But, she can also pull off singing.  She doesn't let her beauty get to her head, nor does she sell out.<BR>The band is truley unique.  DON'T EVER COMPARE THIS BAND TO EVANESCENCE.  Don't ever put these two bands in a same sentence.  It is a whole different genre, a whole different experience. Lacuna is (and I hate to use this) more underground than this new trend of goth-pop chicks.   I can see the emotion come out in their performance.  Lacuna Coil does well being more underground, and haven't the sponsors these other &quot;big&quot; bands grasp, yet they put on a better performance. Watching them live at the venue I attended (some  hell hole) and then seeing how they delt with it, it was breath taking. They need not the big sponsors to boost success.<BR>The bands music is so diverse.  I would not compare their music to any band except maybe The Gathering.  <BR>To the tracks on the CD.  TIGHTROPE!  Okay, the song has great synths and drumming.  Wait till you hear  the pounding guitars and bass.....  And then the vocals are what will honestly make you play the track over and over.  <BR>Heavens a Lie, which has two music videos, is a great one.  Awesome vocals.<BR>Entwined is BEAUTIFUL.  I love the lyrics.<BR>If you want more knoweledge of songs, try Unleashed Memories. That CD is another masterpeice.  <BR>The moral of this review is: DON'T COMPARE TO EVANESCENCE.<BR>Lacuna Coil has been making music much longer.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|this cd is good to my personal opinion i have always enjoy any kind of music in where the lord maynard james keenan is in to but with this cd they kinda like where trying to do something too slow with too many ambiental music instead of more voice and guitar solos, making this review short is a good cd with 5 exellent songs but then goes too slow
B0000CGV00|5.0|I cannot agree more with the review by tommwi, above and  markfarf,below.<BR>A unique and sonically exceptional selection of pieces, coming together in an enormously satisfying experience.<BR>I would love to hear her interpretation of the \\"Waldstein\\" sonata! Highly recommended.
B000092Q4U|5.0|basically this cd shows you the way a metalcore cd shoud be put together fast and direct these guys don't go around the forrest they just give it to you straight with force speed and of course screams that ripped your mind out of the blue ....
0767817710|4.0|Frankly, I have certain reservations about the postmodern (name your &quot;pasta&quot;) western and yet I enjoyed this film which has an outstanding cast, featuring Sharon Stone (Ellen), Gene Hackman (Herod), Russell Crowe (Reverend Cort), and Leonardo DiCaprio (the Kid). The supporting cast includes Gary Sinise (Marshall) and Pat Hingle (Horace the bartender). Herod is the corrupt mayor of Redemption (I'm not making this up) who has organized a quick-draw competition for gunfighters. Ego and greed motivate most of the contestants. Ellen is motivated by revenge. Once an associate of Herod's, Cort is a pacifist and refuses to participate. (Of course, he's also renowned as the quickest draw.) Through a process of deadly elimination, two \\"finalists\\" will soon face each other in the streets, probably without hope of redemption, and then....<br />As directed by Sam Raimi, my only significant criticism of this film is that we learn almost nothing about the background of the major characters prior to their participation in the competition. (Perhaps I have been spoiled by Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, John Sturges' The Magnificent Seven, and more recently, Jeff Blitz's Spellbound.) The Kid is a case in point. Whose son is he? (Herod's?) Raimi raises even more questions about Cort. For example, is he really a clergyman or merely assuming the identity of one such as Robert Mitchum's character in The Night of the Hunter or Clint Eastwood's in Pale Rider? At this point, I ask \\"What difference does it make?\\" So I settle back with some refreshments and stop analyzing the film. (My wife would claim \\"over-analyzing\\" it.) It is what is so I enjoy it for that rather than rattle on about what it is not. Roll it!
B0000C9V3T|5.0|basically tarantino is insane good sound track not even close to the movie itself this guy is out of his mind and it really amused me when some director comes with something like this, way to go tarantino too bad you want to retired from the movie industry you're one of a kind.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|As I began to compose this brief commentary, I remembered that Sofia Coppola was cast as the infant being baptized during the final sequence of events in the first Godfather film (1972) which her father directed. She later appeared in Godfather Part III, a last minute and miscast substitute, reputedly for Winona Ryder. How different this film is from those films as well as The Conversation (1974) and Apocalypse Now/Redux (1979) which her father also directed.<br />With regard to Lost in Translation, she wrote the screenplay as well as directed it, evoking brilliant performances from Bill Murray (as Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansson (as Charlotte). For me, the title suggests multiple dimensions of irony. Some are obviously related to Harris, familiar to those in Tokyo who recognize him but certainly adrift (if not totally lost) in a culture foreign to him in almost every possible way. Other ironies involve communication difficulties unrelated to fluency in language. For example, even after two years of marriage, Charlotte and John (Giovanni Ribisi) are -- to a significant extent -- strangers to each other as are Bob and his wife back in the United States to whom he has been married for quite some time. Moreover, much of the communication between Charlotte and Bob is also lost in translation,  more the result (I think) of generational than linguistic differences. All this suggests an important point to me: It is difficult (if not impossible) for others to know who you are if you don't. It is also so important, moreover, to know who you aren't. Presumably Bob has been struggling with these issues, at least since his career began to evaporate. Both Bob and Charlotte are at or near a crossroad in their respective lives when they first meet. After several days together, their relationship arrives at another crossroad. Which way to go? Where is his life headed? And hers? Will they proceed together?<br />Here are two of several reasons why I admire this film so much. First, thanks to Coppola and her superb cast, it has exceptional charm. There are so many targets of opportunity for a cynical statement. However, to her great credit, she ignores them all. Although there are highly amusing (sometimes zany) moments along the way, to be sure, Coppola develops the characters of Bob and Charlotte with respect and affection but never with condescension. The second reason is that this film has great natural energy which Coppola juxtaposes with moments of intimacy, tenderness, reflection, and even poignancy. To achieve that, Coppola and Lance Acord blend as well as balance exterior shots of Tokyo at night (which resembles Las Vegas) with exterior shots of religious shrines during the day, thereby complementing Charlotte and Bob's diverse moods as they explore at least some of the country in which they feel lost.<br />Given what she achieves in this film, I am eager to see how Coppola's career develops in years to come. My hunch (only a hunch) is that her talents are more diverse than those of her father (e.g. slapstick comedy) and thus the nature and extent of opportunities which await her are greater than those available to him after the first Godfather film (1972). He must be a very proud father....and should be.<br />FYI: The special features of the DVD version include a conversation with Coppola and Murray, a behind-the-scenes featurette which includes exclusive footage shot by the filmmakers (\\"Lost on Location\\"), several deleted scenes, and an extended version of the Japanese TV show, \\"Matthew's Best Hit TV.\\"t, thanks to Coppola and her superb cast, it has exceptional charm.

B0001906O0|5.0|Having been a rabid Cure fan for nearly a decade, I already have most of the songs here on bootlegs, imports, or the original singles. Consequently, I was a bit unsure about spending the money on this. However, I must say it is worth every cent. The remastering job done here is fantastic, really bringing life to some of the older tracks that lacked when transferred to CD format on past bootlegs, and boosting the sound quality of the newer songs. As it is, having the different mixes and unreleased songs (like Possession) is a real treat. The packaging is beautiful, and the notes on each track are facinating. Anyone with more than just a passing interest in the band needs this set. <BR>Sure, it would be nice to have some of the other B-Sides on here as some have said, like Carnage Visors or Spilt Milk, but considering that the entire catalogue will be reissued starting this year, it's tolerable. Honestly, this set is so packed that having extra tracks would be overkill. Besides, a remastered 2 disc set of Faith without Carnage Visors would be pointless. <br />It is too hard to pick a favorite track from this set, because it does flow so well together. Anytime a song gets a little tedious, there is another great song right next to it, especially during the Kiss Me 3x through Wish era. <br />Bottom line: This box set is a fan's dream. Buy it, you will NOT be disappointed.
0345452577|3.0|I really wanted the THE CONSPIRACY CLUB to work. I struggled through the first half of the book and waited for it to set the hook and give me a reason to continue reading. There wasn't one to be found. I even committed the cardinal sin of mystery/thriller readers and skipped ahead to get a jolt and a clue of what was going to happen. Even that failed to excite me to read further. I want desperately for Kellerman's latest to be up to his high standard and be the 5-star thriller other readers have reviewed, but for now it isn't. So I'll try again...later...and lower my expectations. Maybe that will work.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Here's the deal...The album truly deserves more than 5 stars. In this day and age where Staind and Three Days Grace litter the airwaves with mindless garbage, Jet's bad-ass retro rock is the &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; to music this day and age. Their songs have a great feel, even the ballads. There are no songs I could honestly skip. It's a classic album, and I recommend all people that still like rock music to be played the way it was intended to be played to buy this album (if you haven't already).
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee has written one of the finest books to ever be printed.  Mixing heartbreaking emotions with current issues of the time this book surpasses most others.  The prose given to Atticus Finch could not be better.  He is the everyman's hero who shines with simple wisdom and a good heart.  Every person should strive to possess the dignity protrayed in the character of Finch.  Lee also captures perfectly the innocence and wonder of children in her novel.  Scout is the little girl who were all were at one time and wish that we could still be.  I am honored that I was able to live in a time when a person could write such a magnificent book.
006092988X|5.0|I first read this book when I was in high school and only recently read it again.  It is (along with Harper Lee's masterpiece) my favorite novel.  Betty Smith captures the essence of coming of age in a tough world.  She found both the humor and warmth in a life and environment viewed by most as joyless and poor.  Francie is a character to be envied, finding and making the best out of a hard life; she stands up to the world and prentends to be nothing but herself.  Smith writes with such vividness that every detail and character is a superb imaginitive feat.  This book will be a treasure for generations to come.
B00003CXWV|4.0|I just saw this movie last night when it was aired on television.  I was really amazed by how incredible the movie was.  The movie tells the life of George Jung who took a vow when he was a little boy to never be poor and in his adult maybe took that a little too far.  When George grew up he moved to California where he was first introduced to marijuana, and started dealing that.  He was later introduced to cocaine and became the biggest drug lord this country has ever seen- he mentions in the movie that if you snorted coke in the late 70's there was an 85% chance you snorted his coke.  Anyway the movie tells the story of his life with that.  Johnny Depp gave an unbelievable performance as he always does and the script has the right combination of heartfelt moments, drama and humor for a film like this.<br />I also think that this film is so great because it shows what the drug life is really like.  Sure George made 3 million dollars everytime he brough cocaine across the border but look at him at the end of the movie.<br />(and girls- if it turns out that you dont like it, which i doubt will happen, you can just stare at johnny depp the entire time)

But, I do not like the 2 CD Blues collection - I found it slow and boring.  And I do not like his main stream stuff, like Layla, etc.  If this CD contained: &quot;Further on Down the Road&quot; - my fav - I would be in heaven.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Although, I do remember someone lending me this DVD ages ago, and it had a gag-reel on it. Mine doesn't :( Poor me. Anyway, watching this film on DVD was terrific, having only previously watched it on video (which no one wants to buy!!!) This movie has some of the cutest guys in it - Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Michael Clarke Duncan and Billy Bob Thornton?! My eyes must deceive me, as he always looks virtually unrecognisable in films, to what he looks like normally - unkempt, sleazy looking, and a craggy looking old man. (Is it just me?) And yes, I do have a thing for older men! This movie shot Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck to A-list stardom, and gave them Lord Of The Rings and Jennifer Lopez respectively.<br />I was quite surprised to see a couple of scenes that I hadn't seen before on the video. During the segment where the &quot;astronauts&quot; get the night off, you see Oscar praying, and Harry visiting his Dad. I literally did a double take when I saw these, especially since I've watched the movie many times. There was also another scene, but I forget what it was, or where it was now.<br />I own the 2-disc edition (which I can't find for the life of me on Amazon), so there's a lot more extras than listed here. Most of them are pretty tedious though, and I'm still fizzing about the gag-reel. It's so funny! I'll maybe watch the commentaries sometime, as there's two on this - the one with the NASA experts will be terrific on a night when I can't sleep. But the other one has Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis, which should be interesting. The extras are tedious, as they go through the special effects used for various scenes in the movie, and you've got some glorified assistant, who really had nothing to do with the movie, going into lengthy detail about the smallest thing. And use lots of fancy jargon, which definitely stupid people (like moi) can't understand. And never will understand. The DVD should have a warning sticker on it - &quot;Do Not Watch Extras If Stupid&quot;.<br />You also get the music video to &quot;I Don't Want To Miss A Thing&quot; (one of the best love songs), and I'd seen this video many times, so I wasn't expecting there to be an introduction to the video by the members of Aerosmith! Cool.<br />Name one girl who hasn't cried at this movie. I am definitely not in that category. I originally saw this movie in the cinema, and had to go cry away to myself in the toilets afterwards (highly embarrassing). And then when I got it on video, I couldn't stop crying!!! People may say it's only a film, but it's so sad!!! Thankfully, I didn't cry at the first watching of this DVD. I did get a little teary, but not full-on crying. Oh guys crying get me going!! Anyone crying gets me going, who am I kidding!<br />A terrific film, definitely a good one to watch for the guys or the special effects. Or Liv Tyler if you're that way inclined, but any girl will feel the green eyed monster rear its ugly head.<br />Now, about that gag-reel ...;.<br />You also get the music video to &quot;I Don't Want To Miss A Thing&quot; (one of the best love songs), and I'd seen this video many times, so I wasn't expecting there to be an introduction to the video by the members of Aerosmith!

B000021YQV|5.0|this is a great rock album! It's not nu-metal, not heavy, not trash, not punk ..... it's everything together, all styles mixed up in a wonderful sound!

0375432302|5.0|Like many others, I found this book to be an exciting page turner.  I had read that Brown had spent a lot of time researching the different ideas presented in his book so I wanted to see for myself to what extent the ideas of the book were based on truth.  It appears that Brown was sucked into a hoax that many before him also bought into.  The priory documents that gave him the basis for his claims were most likely forgeries deposited by noted criminal, con artist, and prankster Pierre Plantard who registered the Priory of Sion in 1956 with a group of friends.  I could go on and on about how Plantard claimed to have deposited those documents which also pointed to him as a member of the Merovigian line amongst other claims.  However, one of the great things about writing a fiction book is that the author is free to expand on thoughts of what if this was true without worrying about having to back up everything stated.  Whether Brown knew this was false or got caught up in this hoax is irrelevant to the fact that this is an incredible fast paced book.  Brown's description of the artwork and various locations caused me to vividly remember exactly what he was talking about from my own experiences.  Many have described this book as \\"...an intelligent thriller...\\" for which I would have to agree.  I found myself not wanting to put the book down and also stopping the midst of the story to try and decipher the codes before the characters.  I would most definitely encourage others to read this book just keep in mind while reading that it is fiction.
B000002H33|5.0|You certainly already know that this one is considered as the best Metallica album by band's biggest fans.It is also known as the greatest thrash-metal album and one of the greatest albums in metal at all.I won't disagree with all that,no,i'd rather say it again thousand times so it will turn even more nu-metal kids and rap/trance/pop fans into the most pure,real metal,the greatest music known to a man.Ok,i now introduce the tracks,as i found the so-many-times-used track-by-track review as the most comfortable.NB! If you would first like to download some tracks of the album to know what it's like,i did a little favour for you.In this and every next coming review of mine,i'll mark 3 tracks from the album with a sign -&gt; * &lt;- that show the strongest sides of album.Ok,to the tracks...<br />Battery 9/10 - a very good starter with fast chorus that will immediately suck you in the mood of the album.<br />* Master Of Puppets 10/10 - an 8-minute epic track,everything is excellently done here,one of the best from Metallica.<br />The Thing That Should Not Be 10/10 - wow...those heavy riffs...i love them...the tone of James's voice in this one is also so awesome.A superb part of a flawless album.<br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 8/10 - The best ballad of Metallica,in my opinion,is Fade To Black,but this comes close.Put between the heavier tracks,so you can relax a little.<br />* Disposable Heroes 10/10 - Another great 8-minute run that you can compare with the title track in terms of how good it is.<br />Leper Messiah 9/10 - Fantastic main riff,nice sounding chorus...and all other things you could ask for a metal song,are here...not the best in here,but it could easily be the best song in most of the other metal albums.<br />Orion (instrumental) 8/10 - you probably think that you can't stand an 8-minute instrumental,but if you hear it opening,you will immediately rethink that.<br />* Damage,Inc. 10/10 - There's no better way to close an album than the final adrenaline rushstraight to the brain.It's a fast one,so if the track (and the album) closes,you will start bagging for more and buy another Metallica album,if you're a new fan,of course,and here's a tip for that case - buy Ride The Lightning,many fans think it's even better than the one here.<br />Album Rating - 10/10
0140277447|5.0|To the Japanese that posted here. You have been taught a lie. And unfortunately for you and those who will not beleive evidence, whatever their motivation, the world knows it.<br />In today's touchy racial enviroment in the US it is unfortuate that truths as addressed by this book get written off as racist toward Japanese (or maybe even asians in a pan-national sense).<br />What if Germans denied the Holocaust? They would be called on it. And I'm calling it the denying of Nanking. Not to punish Japanese for the &quot;sins of the fathers,&quot; but because it IS the truth.<br />This book has a more &quot;human&quot; appeal rather than a bland book of dates and statistics.

My teacher recommended that we purchase a copy of the book so that we could make notes in the margins.  I went all the way and bought this lovely Centennial Edition... and then I couldn't bear to write in it!  I recommend this book to any and all people, while recommending this particular edition to true fans.  It would make a great gift to a lover of great literature and/or John Steibeck himself.
B00005JME0|4.0|From what I'd read, I had admittedly low expectations when I went to see this film.  And the truth is, there are inconsistent performances and some lazy shortcuts in the construction of the story, but all in all, I really loved what the writer/directors were trying to do here, and I especially loved how they chose to resolve it.  So, file it under guilty pleasures maybe, but I dug it.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|If you're a Floyd fan, then you know that the best way to experience their music is with both audio and visual.  That's why this new dvd, \\"Live in Pompeii\\" is a must have.  If you already own and love the video version like I do, you'll be blown away by the dvd.  It has both the original version (in pan scan, minus the interviews) and a new director's cut (widescreen, with added interviews) as well.  The visuals in this video are just amazing.  The ancient amphitheater among the ruins of Old Pompeii is awesome and a great place for the band to play.  There is a great mosaic shot of Nick Mason that is pretty trippy. The director's cut has footage from the band's recording of Dark Side, and some great interviews with the guys.  This is definitely a must have for anyone's Floyd collection.
0805047905|5.0|This is another time-tested classic by author/illustrator Eric Carle.  It opens asking a brown bear what he sees, and he replies, and the next page is the animal that he saw, and he is asked what he sees, and so on and so on.<br />As you might expect from Carle, his simple but wonderful illustrations are a big part of the appeal of this book. Each two-page layout is a colorful animal centered on a white background, and that's it.  Kids will effortlessly learn colors and animal names as you read it to them, and maybe a little sequential logic.  I'd say it's a great book for ages 1 through 5. (At least, my five-year-old still likes to sit in while I read it to my two-year-old).<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle

0452282152|5.0|There are two types of people that shouldn't read this book; 1.  Romantics who studied art history, and 2.  People hoping for a historically detailed account of 17th Century Flanders.  Romantics who love Vermeer's paintings will finish this book disillusioned and sad.  Historians will get very little detail to satisfy  their desire for a complete picture of this period.  On the other hand, those hoping for a good novel with historical references and overtones, or perhaps a glimpse into the process of artists in Vermeer's time, will enjoy Girl with a Pearl Earring very much.<br />GWAPE is mostly historical fiction about a beautiful teenage girl's years spent as a maid in the service of famous painter Vermeer's household.  Griet is a hardworking, intelligent sort who has wonderful work ethics and really just wants to help out her parents, who have fallen on hard times.  During her stay with this family she unexpectedly becomes an apprentice of sorts to the painter after he realizes she has some undeveloped talent (which a girl of her station would never realize, normally).  Although the cover art hints at a juicy affair between the two, this is just a cheap marketing ploy.  The real romance is between Griet and her discovery of art.<br />It's not that author Tracy Chevalier didn't do her research.  The parts of this book that talk of camera obscura, how paints were mixed, the hierarchy of a wealthy household and the social customs of that age speak of a great deal of research and indeed, insight.  Without being any kind of expert myself I'd bet that Chevalier studied these things in great depth.  It's just that life outside of the domestic sphere is sketched in only very sparingly.  One does not get a very fulfilling view of Flanders through this book.<br />The overstory about maid Griet and her \\"sensual awakening\\" to the art in light and the objects around her is beautifully done.  I could not ask for a better description.  What troubled me was that every other character in this tale was completely blind to anything but their own prejudices, petty concerns and agendas - including Vermeer himself!  Each person sees Griet either as a commodity or a threat, based on stereotypes or their own insecurities.  To Vermeer she is a \\"muse\\" to inspire him, even at the expense of exhausting her with too much work and endangering her position in the household.  To his wife Catharina, Griet is a sneaky young upstart who coveted her man.  To the children and servants Griet is a drudge without a life outside their house.  To Veermeer's patron she is an easy victim for his advances.  Even her own parents see her as nothing more than a means by which they could obtain meat and financial security through her engagement.  Griet's feelings and precarious situation never enter anybody's mind save perhaps Vermeer's mother-in-law's.  Her resulting loneliness and isolation gradually backs her into a corner where she has no other options but to play the game by rules she detests.  Her reward is more slander and work.<BR> <BR>I have no doubt that the scenario described in this book was a common problem for poor girls in this historical period.  My objection is to its use as a device to manipulate the reader's sympathies.  Do we need another story of yet one more victim of outdated patriarchal evils?<br />Worse, Vermeer is forever ruined for me.  While as an art student I could appreciate his paintings on a purely aesthetic level, now I can't help but think about poor Griet and Chevalier's speculations of the stories behind them.  It leaves a bitter aftertaste.  I can now only think of Vermeer as a self-centered boor who just happpened to be blessed with extraordinary gifts.<br />Yes, GWAPE was well-written, enjoyable even.  Though the last 100 pages I couldn't put it down.  Yet, I will always be sorry now that I read it.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B000002W9P|5.0|This band and especially Kai Hansen (songwriter/guitarist) had an extraordinary talent and imagination to write all of the songs in the album. By combining influences ranging from Iron Maiden (Number Of The Beast - Powerslave era) to Queen, Rainbow and Queensryche, together with fast drumming, high pitched-melodic vocals, melodic and technical riffs with fabulous twin-guitar solos, Helloween achieved to lay the foundations for European power metal, as it is known today.     The album begins with an operatic marching type intro which sets successfully the mood of the album. The intro leads nicely into the fast paced \\"I'm Alive\\", which carries an optimistic message and includes a memorable chorus, fast drumming, raving guitar solos and twin-guitar harmonies. The heavy \\"A Little Time\\" comes next with another catchy chorus and sound effects, while the melodic mid range vocals sound really emotional and warm. Onwards comes the metal ballad \\"A Tale that wasn't Right\\" to slow things down a bit, whose strongest points are the truly emotional vocals and the wonderfully played guitar solo. \\"Twilight Of The Gods\\" continues in the same vain as 'I'm Alive' but contains more thought-out lyrics, better vocals and a chorus that you'll never forget. \\"Future World\\" follows, which is the most famous of the tracks, a heavy metal anthem, played in mid-tempo, comprising of one of the best twin-guitar solos of the album and vocals varying from low tempo to really high-pitched. Next comes the true masterpiece of the album \\"Halloween\\", an operatic-fast-progressive-emotional power metal hymn raving over 13 minutes (which never gets long nor tiresome). All of those songs are still considered classics and for sure are some of the best and most epic power metal songs ever written (together with Eagle Fly Free, pt II).     But except the captivating music, a new charismatic vocalist, \\"Michael Kiske\\", joins the band to take this album to the skies! Influenced by Bruce Dickinson, Klaus Meine and Jeoff Tate but equipped with much more emotion and range, especially in the high pitched vocal lines, 18 year old Kiske makes this album a MUST HAVE for any metal and hard rock fan. (M.Kiske is still considered one of the best and most copied vocalists in the heavy metal genre)     Even if you are not a metal fan, this album will please you or even blow you away with the mythical and uplifting atmosphere it creates and the technically perfect orchestration it achieves. (Definitely check out Keeper Of The Seven Keys pt II!!)     Will be loved by Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Queensryche, Rainbow...fans.   Just listen...you'll be amazed!
0953104907|2.0|if you have never built a guitar before, do not get this book.  this book does not tell you how to build a guitar, it is just a book of tips on building a guitar.  there are no steps and everything is out of order.  first it tells you how to install a truss rod, then it tells you how to install frets, then it tells you how to build a neck, then it tells you how to put the neck on the body, then it tells you how to the body is made in 3 different ways.  the whole thing is out of order and confusing, i am very disappointed.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I had never heard a Linkin Park song in my life until I bought this cd, so I had NO idea what to expect. All I knew was that this was a band who had electric guitars. That's ALL I knew. So that being said, I heard this cd with an open mind.<br />This is hands down one of the best cds ever. I have listened to this cd so many times that I ended up seeing them in concert just to cure my obsession.<br />I also bought hybrid theory after this one and was thrilled with that as well.<br />This cd has lots of emotion - some soft and slow - and others hardcore - but not to the point of killing your eardrums. Great music, stuff you can belt out in your car and scream and still know what you are saying.

B000089RVX|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best cds in my collection. In fact, if I were to own only 3 cds - this would be one of them. That's saying a lot considering I own more cds than a music store probably does.<br />You know it's a great cd when you can listen to it: when you want to wake up and start your day, when you're tired from work and want to relax, when you're mad and pissed off, when you want to make love to someone, when you want to impress people in your home, and when you just want to listen to raw talent.<br />This is definitely a cd worth getting. And if you don't like it (which I am sure you will) then I guarantee that the person beside you listening to it will disagree with you.<br />Just trust me, get the cd.
0380002930|5.0|It was Sunday night, I needed to pick an Outside Reading Book for English class the next morning.  On my shelf I spotted Watership Down, a book I never was interested in reading.  Nonetheless, I chose it out of neccesity, and computed that to get through the tedium I expected it to be, I would have to read 3 chapters a night.  I sat down and began to read...but there was no chance I was going to stop reading after 3 chapters.  It ensnared me with its depictions of a world we miss, depictions that author Richard Adams illustrates in vibrant detail.  I ended up finishing &quot;the bunny book&quot;, as my friends dubbed it, in less than 3 days.<br />All one needs to know about the plot is that one of the characters, Fiver, has a premonition:  death and destruction is coming to the warren in which they live, and they must flee or die.  Fiver's brother Hazel beleives him, and attempts to convince as many rabbits as they can to leave the warren and save their lives.  The vagabonds set out, at the mercy of the overwhelming number of enemies rabbits have, not to mention the cruelty of their own kind.....they set out to find a home, and what a glorious adventure it is.<br />This book is wonderful on so many levels.  It vividly creates characters until the reader feels that he or she can not only understand them, but relate to them and their problems.  It not only creates a language for these characters, these rabbits, seemlessly integrated through expository footnotes and a dictionary in the back, but an entire culture as well.  The reader learns of the complex rabbit hierarchy, from the despot Chief Rabbits who have their food brought underground to them to the outskirters, &quot;all too accustomed to getting the short end of the stick.&quot;  We learn of the rabbit's God and Underworld, their folk heroes and their legends.  The book is also a political allegory: when one analyses the different warrens, paralells can be seen with Fascism, communism, and other political systems. Adams also puts an applicable quote before each chapter, alluding to past works such as Julius Caesar and Greek Mythology.  The quotes are always pertinent and ascertaining how they pertain to the chapter is enjoyable.  But on top of all that, this book is an adventure story of the highest order, a truely enthralling piece of literature that is truly the only book that I can say, &quot;I laughed, I cheered, I cried&quot; about.  Im not much of a crying man, but Adams' characters are so well drawn it is impossible not to become attached to them.<br />Please, all of you, do yourself a favor and read Watership Down.tems.

B00005YW4H|5.0|This cd is mellow and moving, definitely the type of music to listen to when you are by yourself and just need to feel loved or less alone... or just when you want to unwind.<br />After buying this cd (and the live version on dvd in the House of Blues as well) - I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert in Clearwater, FL and she is just as peaceful and moving in concert as she is on the cd.<br />Her voice is crisp and clear, the cd is definitely a classic... a timeless collection of songs that are soothing to your ears.

0385504209|1.0|This book used every myth/legend/superstition in history, to the point of being nauseating.  I laughed out laughed when he brought up the little mermaid as supporting material for his book.  I thought for sure that I was going to find some religious backing behind Superman, Batman, and Scooby Doo.<br />Even though the plot was easily discovered the agenda that Dan Brown has was even more evident.  He writes a highly controversial book about an author(sorry I meant symbologist) that publishes a highly controversial book about religious data (inaccurate at best) and hopes no one realizes that the main character is actually named Dan Brown, not Robert Langdon.  The pansy smelling, panty wearing, smart car driving, sexual deviant that is Dan Brown (I mean Robert Langdon) makes for a poor Indiana Jones.<br />P.S.  Why would Da Vinci, the homosexual, be the Grand Master of a society that celebrated and ritualized the sexual union of a man and woman?  Come on Dan - think before you write.<br />I will never read another Dan Brown book again.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I have had people ask why I loved a movie about a mentally challenged man, when that subject has been exhausted in movies.<BR>I don't really see this film as a movie about a dumb man.<BR>The writer had to have a character without ego or high intellect,and a pure heart, in order to create one of the meaningful points of the story.<BR> Forrest goes through a time period of great upheaval, ending up in situations that are a sometimes tragic and sometimes absurd result of ego,greed or power- and it his reaction to it that is important. If you love the idea of heart and humanity unintentionally making us see right through some of the results of lesser characteristics of humanity, you will probably love this film.  <BR>I thought the original book was excellent too. There is much more detail. For example, the ping-pong and Mao Tsetung part of the story was very funny - some great satire. I highly recommend both those who love this type of story.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This wonderful and beautifully acted film concerns Pai, a girl being raised by her grandparents in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe. She believes she is destined to become the tribe's new chief - and nearly loses her life (riding a whale out to sea) to prove her point.

B000006SGT|5.0|I bought this double cd after I had practically worn out the Animals' greatest hits album. If you like that album, you are sure to love this one. It includes all of the original Animals' music, recorded from 1964 to 1965. It's hard to believe that Eric and the boys created so much great music in such an extraordinarily short period of time, but they did. This includes so many great r&b covers, I can't even name them all. My personal favorites include \\"Worried Mind\\" (reminiscent of early Zep), \\"Ain't Got You\\", and many, many more. The Animals (esp. Burdon) were the very best of British r & b. Why are they so underrated? Eric Burdon has the sexiest, most emotive voice I've probably ever heard in this genre. If you like the Stones, the Beatles, the Who, Zep, and ANY blues, you will surely love the Animals. I listen to these two cds at least once a week, if not more. In fact, I've listened to them so much I'm almost embarrassed because every time my fiance drives my car, one of these cds is in there. He doesn't mind because he loves them too, even though he's more of a hard rock/metal fan. Do yourself a favor and indulge yourself with the greatest blue-eyed soul ever created: The Animals!
B00003CXDD|5.0|I've always felt that fantasy is just not my genre. But now and then a film comes along and forces me to reconsider by opinions. Willow is one of those films, an epic by the Lucas film industry.<BR>The plot is that there is an evil queen (of course), wonderfully played by Jean Marsh who needs to find the baby who will end her reign. Pregnant women are imprisoned, and their babies are inspected. But the midwife who delivers the precious and sacred baby spirits her from the castle and sets the child adrift on the river. She is found by Willow, a little person with a big heart, who sets out on a trek to return her to the Daikini, the big humans.<BR>Adventures, dragons, evil, sorcerers, battles, and magic ensue, and it's all accompanied by beautiful scenery (English and Welsh countryside), wonderful acting, and Ron Howard, a great director. Plus, there's Val Kilmer to enjoy, so what's to complain about? Nothing.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Ten, Vs. &amp; Vitalogy were all equally great albums.  Nothing they put out afterward came close to matching the power of these three albums.
0312319517|3.0|The major portion of this novel is used to develop the characters and motives.  As a result, it skips about quite a bit in location and time before getting to the final plot.  In between, the author provides essays on various portions of history ranging from Bosnia to Vietnam.  I found myself skimming some parts to get on with the story.<br />The Avenger comes across as an A-Team of one, although he has support from various sources.  A former Tunnel Rat in Vietnam, he is smart, cunning, in excellent physical condition (he trains for the triathalon), and is willing to kill (although he usually does not).  Lots of money from his client, and good contacts (both legal and illegal), allow him many options and identities, although someone knows his true name.<br />Considering the amount of effort expended in developing the varuous characters in the novel, one expects that the author is planning a sequel.
B000003TA4|5.0|So much has been written and said about this album.  Whatever a person feels about it, it changed the face of music at the time.  No album in the past 20 years has had as much impact as quickly as 'Nevermind'.  Granted, everything was aligned perfectly for this album to be monumental in some ways, but it would not have happend as it did had it not been a GREAT album.   The first time I heard it, I was blown away.  Within a matter of days, I also went out and bought 'Bleach' and was equally impressed.  Their sound was like nothing I had heard before.  <BR>Simply put, from beginning to end, this is an incredible, monumental album.
1878424319|5.0|One day, I was standing in the meta-physical department of a local book store when I saw Don Miguel's book. It was one of those moments where you are caught off guard and find yourself saying, &quot;hey, I know him&quot;. Some years ago, I had spent a weekend retreat with him high upon a plateau over looking the ocean off of Baja Mexico. He is a very kind and loving man. He is the type of person whom you can feel the truth of his soul in all he says and does. I did not follow the Toltec path however, because I was already on my own, but it was a pleasure to be in his company, particularly, since I had drank some water and was feeling rather ill. I did not buy Mr. Ruiz's book because his teachings are somewhat basic to me. However, he walks his talk and he personally inquired about my feeling ill, as any true teacher worth his salt would. He teaches by telling stories, does not shove meditation down your throat, and everyone participates in group fashion. A very kind, loving and gentle soul. A true spiritual teacher. Soak up anything up can!
B000003TAW|5.0|I love this album.  It's extremely solid.  'The World has turned and left me here', 'Only in dreams', and 'Undone - The Sweater Song' are the best tracks.  People think of Weezer of a novelty band and that couldn't be further from the truth.  <BR>Give it a chance and you will not be disappointed!
B000068FY1|5.0|Words cannot describe the timeless magical quality of this record.<br />It is a uniqie, one of a kind treasure for all time.<br />If one were to create a concrete greatest records of all time list, this would be in the top twenty, without question.<br />A truly rare gem of a record. This is the kind of thing the sad radio scene has not been playing. Music has been made the past 10-15 years that ecplipses much of the music from the 60's and 7o's. This is one of those records.<br />And please, enough with the Gram Parsons comparisons. The Jayhawks are light years better, and with a more original sound.
B0000C5RQF|2.0|This DVD may be enjoyed by those who have seen the magic flute more than 10 times and are very familiar with so-to-say typical expression, style, etc. Music/singers are excellent, and there are a lot of modern innovation that could be praised (though to me many of them are negative). But to those who have listened CD, possibly have seen video or DVD once or twice, and buying this DVD for the first time, it will be a very disappointing purchase. It is just very different from what you would expect. And if you were to own just one DVD or VHS of the magic flute in your collection, this cannot be the one to go. <BR> <BR> First, you will be shocked to find that the interesting conversation between Papageno and Tamino are cut out. Later also dialogue between Papageno and Monostatos is cut. The latter one really cut off one interesting scene from the play. I didn't notice all the other changes one by one, but we got an impression that it is largely cut and altered, and it is somehow losing essential elements of this opera. <BR> <BR>The costumes are also shocking. <BR> Tamino is dressed like a factory worker in early 20c rather than a prince in 17-18c. Papageno is like that, with a knit vest with ducks printed: while he sings \\"I will be plucked...\\" he does not have any feathers. He just wears a hat with a bird's head and wings sticking out, this is the only thing he wears as a \\"bird man\\". <BR> Sarastro is dressed like a pirate rather than a mystic leader of secret organization. <BR> Papagena is dressed like a modern-day prostitute with a regular fur coat on sexy dress with sun-glasses, and does not look like 80yr old at all from the beginning. She just looks like a crazy girl. She just takes her coat off when she becomes an 18yr old girl. <BR> Monostatos: I think his appearance is related to the fact that they cut the dialogue: his face is painted all white and whiter than Papageno. So the scene of Papageno and Monostatos getting scared of each other, as Monostatos being black, Papageno being like a bird, is completely altered and reduced to a nonsensical scene. It might be due to political incorrectness, but cutting only this does not make sense since whole opera is politically incorrect anyway. <BR>  Three boys:they are really boys and they sing very well. Actually I bought this DVD because the other one (by a scandinavian group) used women for the boys. They dress like school boys. Not angelic at all. <BR>The queen of night and three women are OK. They reminded me of Kabuki. Somehow all of them are always very tense.<BR> <BR> As a summary for the costumes, I would say it is very down to earth. This opera is supposed to be a fairly tale, but the costumes contribute to anything but that.<BR> <BR> I would like to comment on some positive things about this product besides the quality of music. Papageno's physical action is remarkable and funny. (I will not explain it here so that you could be surprised) Also animals (especially the bird and the dragon in the beginning) are cute and nice. And the model of the sun was good; they even got black spots on it. <BR>   <BR>Overall, if this was a CD of a collection of arias from the magic flute, it will be truthful and excellent quality. But if you have a DVD version called the magic flute, the visual effect and dialogues are key things. This DVD was like a combination of the arias from the magic flute, dialogues from somewhere else, and visual is from a modern hollywood blockbuster comedy movie. <BR>I could say it is an elaborated and well-made production, and it is well-filmed, too. It is just different.
B000002A3T|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece.  It starts off with a spacey track titled \\"Cluster One\\".  It sounds like radio static or something of the like, but it's very ambient.  Other favorites include \\"Poles Apart\\", which appears to be written for Syd Barrett (including a nice little segment of carnival music--very good for expressing the idea of insanity, it comes across well), \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\", a taste of Richard Wright's melancholy ambiance, \\"Take It Back\\", a beautifully passionate piece, \\"Coming Back To Life\\", which has a very nice guitar solo and deep lyrics (Dave and Polly really did an awesome job here--It's amazing what can happen when two soul mates work together on a musical piece--it gives it a spiritual element that can't be reached any other way), \\"Lost For Words\\" which sounds as though it was written for Roger Waters, but only Dave can answer that, and last but certainly not least, \\"High Hopes\\", a song every Pink Floyd fan knows and loves.  The slide solo on this track is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Momentary Lapse of Reason (another awesome album), then this is definitely for you.  These two albums almost fit together--Momentary Lapse is about coming together, whereas The Division Bell is about growing apart.  They really ought to release these two as a 2-CD set.  Excellent Job to Dave (and Polly), Nick, and Rick!  Shine on!
B00000JCOV|3.0|Please ignore my previous review of Slipknot.

B000002J27|5.0|This is one of the first albums I purchased on CD - and it's been one of my favorites ever since.  &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; is the sound of four talented musicians, brimming with ideas and rushing forth to fill the creative void created by the departure of lead singer Peter Gabriel.  The result is an album of remarkably consistent quality, with enough diversity and subtlety to continually reward the listener.  I've never gotten tired of &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; - I don't think you will, either!<br />Despite the loss of Gabriel, the remaining members (Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford) successfully retain his penchant for whimsical storytelling.  There's a delightful romp about cops `n' robbers (\\"Robbery Assault and Battery\\") and not one, but two, songs about imaginary beasts (\\"Squonk\\" and the title track).  The ballads \\"Ripples,\\" \\"Entangled\\" and \\"Mad Man Moon\\" capture the softer, more atmospheric side of Genesis.  Oh yeah - these guys can also flat out rock, which they do most powerfully on the opening and closing tracks (\\"Dance on a Volcano\\" and \\"Los Endos\\").  Now, nothing approaches the grandeur of \\"Supper's Ready\\" or \\"The Musical Box,\\" but the overall quality of the songs is so good that the record stands among Genesis' best.<br />Sadly, this lineup would only produce one more album (the fine \\"Wind and Wuthering\\") before Steve Hackett left the band.  The loss of Hackett allowed the remaining members to gradually transform Genesis into a Top 40 hit machine.  They would go on to pop superstardom, but never again recorded an album as rich, varied, or consistently excellent as &quot;A Trick of the Tail.&quot;
0380778556|4.0|I had to read this book during the summer before entering high school. At first I found this book to be utterly boring, it is very long and very detailed at the beginning -- characters are very well developed -- especially the famously unnamed narrator. However, if you can get pass the first three-quarters of the book, it is very enjoyable. The plot is dark, mysterious and the outcome of the book is very ironic. I found myself upon completing the book to be very surprised and wanting more to read.

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is like pie.  On the outside all you see is the plain crust, a standard adventure story.  Inside however, is what really counts, the delicious filling, a story bringing up controversial issues narrated by a brilliant character.<BR>Martel has written two other works of fiction, Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios, published in 1993, and Self, published in 1996.  Both novels received reasonably good reviews yet both sold few copies.  Martel's new novel Life of Pi, however, is truly a masterpiece. <BR> The novel is about Pi; an Indian boy who practices Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam while living at his family's zoo.  As the story continues he ends up on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger in the middle of the Pacific Ocean for 227 days and lives to tell the tale.  The premise of the novel seems completely inconceivable.  However, Martel tells his account in an incredibly convincing way.  He does this especially through the voice of Pi.<BR>Pi's voice is new and refreshing, but also human.  He opens reader's eyes.    Throughout the novel, he shares his beliefs of religion, zoos, and life.  Some people might be offended by Pi practicing three different religions.  Especially relating to the book's claim that it will \\"make you believe in God,\\" (x).  It seems potentially over zealous.  Although his religious practices may seem bizarre, it makes more sense when Pi puts it as, \\"I just want to love God,\\" (69).  He knows what is truly important.  Each religion fulfills a different requirement for him, but he still knows the basis to each.  Pi makes improbable ideas like that probable.  He also shows how zoos are the perfect home for animals; on page 17 he states, \\"In a zoo, we do for animals what we have done for ourselves with houses: we bring together in a small space what in the wild is spread out.\\"  Pi brings up things that most of us do not think of, which makes reading his fresh ideas appealing.<BR>Unfortunately, the story does become a little unrealistic at times.  Especially towards the end of the novel there are a couple of events that take place that seem completely implausible, which does take away from some of the meaning of the story for some readers.  However in general the story is believable and enjoyable.<BR>Admittedly, there is also the initial concerned about reading a Pacific Ocean survival story.  That it will only include the typical elements of survival; issues with food, water, heat, insanity, and of course your standard big storm.  Although these concerns are presented and are moderately dull at times, the novel is not boring as some might fear it would be.  The story is still refreshing and intriguing because of Pi's voice, and the problem of a colossal tiger as a shipmate.<BR>Pi's voice is also humorous because he is brutally honest and says what he thinks.  He is very excited when he meets Americans for the first time.  \\"They were pink, fat, friendly, very competent and sweated profusely...  We got big smiles from the Americans and bone-crushing handshakes,\\" (90).  Pi had never seen Americans before, but when he is introduced to them he immediately pins down the American stereotype, yet describes it in a new way.  This makes Martel's character of Pi that much more believable.<BR> Martel also makes his novel realistic and believable by the way it is organized.  The story begins with Pi in college, and then goes back to his fascinating childhood in India, and on to his adventure in the Pacific Ocean; all of this interspersed with pieces of Pi's life as an adult.  Readers know Pi goes on a Pacific voyage with the company of a massive tiger and that it is an astonishing adventure.  However, they also know he survives, and there is life after the adventure, and Pi's life is defiantly not the same after his Pacific voyage.  By adding portions of Pi's adult life throughout the novel it makes his character real and readers become connected to Pi and his various predicaments in an unexpected way.<BR> Overall, Life of Pi is an exceptionally enjoyable read, due to the structure of the novel, Martel's creativity, and the voice of Pi.  Pi is charming, funny, and he makes readers think in a different way about different things.  Anyone with an open mind will surely enjoy this fascinating read, tasty as a piece of pie.
B00005RHGL|5.0|1993 found a memorable cast working together to make a great film... Kirk Russell (as Wyatt Earp), Val Kilmer (as Doc Holliday), Sam Elliott (as Virgil Earp), Bill Paxton (as Morgan Earp), Powers Booth (as Curly Bill), and Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo). Not to mention superb supporting roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston, Jason Priestley, and Dana Delaney. \\"Tombstone\\" takes you back to 1881 when the Earp brothers stumble into Tomstone, AZ to settle down with their spouses. It isn't long before the outlaw \\"Cowboys\\" led by Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo make trouble and the Earps decide to take action. Val Kilmer plays a witty and charasmatic Doc Holliday - the best I've ever seen - probably one of Kilmer's finest Hollywood roles. A chunky Billy Bob Thornton has a memorable role as Johnny Tyler - as Wyatt's first punk to pick on. The first half of the movie sets up the characters nicely. The second half of the movie really gets going when Wyatt Earp yells at Johnny Ringo at the train station... \\"You tell him I'm coming! And Hell's coming with me!\\" You just know that the Earp's and Doc are going to kick some major as*. The gunfights were excellent. The town with it's buildings and surroundings were believeable. Director George P. Cosmatos has not put out a finer movie to this date. This special (2002) director's cut 2-disc set gives the audience superior 5.1 dolby sound; approx 5 minutes of extra movie footage; a director's commentary; a timeline of the story, 3 different production featurette's; a corny \\"collectable\\" Tombstone map; and a game of chance (you'll play once and probably never play again). A classic western and a personal favorite (5 stars).
068983571X|4.0|Where can you find giant hounds that stalk and kill an innocent victim in the night?  Well, a good place to look for this dreadful event is in Arthur Conan Doyle's novel, Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Hound of the Baskervilles.  It is a wonderful, but mysterious book that will surely keep you on the edge of your seat.  Sherlock Holmes is a very intelligent protagonist who always has a wise explanation for everything that seems unusual.  This novel takes place in the gloomy swamplands of England, around the Baskerville estate.  The main conflict in the story is Person vs. Nature because during almost the whole story, Holmes is trying to find the ghostlike hound and figure out exactly what is going on.<br />I enjoyed this book a lot because it doesn't give away too much information and allows you to think about all of the possible explanations for the hound which are probably much worse then the actual reasons.  I also felt almost like I was right there with Sherlock helping him solve the case.  Overall the book was very good but one feature that I didn't like is my edition, illustrated by Pablo Marcos Studio, had many pictures and they definitely weren't how I pictured the hound, it didn't even look like a hound or any kind of animal I have ever seen for that matter.  I would have liked to have used more of my imagination to visualize how I think the hound should really look. Despite what you may have heard, this book is not stupid or boring; it is actually very interesting and I think you would enjoy it if you have an open mind.

The Beatles were/are the royal family of Pop Music.  If there is any musician of equal statue, it is certainly Clapton, and his involvement in any endeavor always guarantees that the highest quality, and taste is used in the final disposition of the work.<br />Many have written here of the glorious show, and the wonderful efforts put forth by these great, and beloved artists who gathered at the Royal Albert Hall that night to give tribute, and celebrate the life, and accomplishments of Harrison, so I won't spout redundant comentary using the same superlatives that you must certainly have read numerous times in the previous reviews in this forum.  But, I will say that it is with great appreciation to all the principles in this effort that I offer my thanks for this gem that I will surely view many more times in the future.  George Harrison will be missed by many, but his music will never be forgotten, and this DVD package is an excellent way to enjoy his music, and honor his memory.
B0000CABBW|4.0|WHALE RIDER is one of those independent sleepers that happens to catch the hearts of the movie audience, much like MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING etc. Simple stories with universal truths told well.  This could easily be a National Geographic documentary for all its beauty of New Zealand. But it has much more: the little known Maori people of New Zealand have been celebrated by such well known descendants as soprano Kiri Te Kanawa who introduces Maori folksongs on her highly lauded performances throughout the world, but rarely have we been given the insights into a wondrous strange reflection of our tribal beginnings as we have here.<br />WHALE RIDER is a simple tale of a tribe who are dependent upon the firstborn males to carry on the wisdom of the ancients. When Piakea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is born her twin MALE brother dies as does her mother.  Paikea's claim to the line of chieftains is denied by her grandfather and the townspeople, only serving to encourage Paikea to prove that she is deserving of the role to which she feels she is born.  The means by which she gains her rightful place fill out this story.  There is a tearful speech about her history and beliefs that brings tears to everyone's eyes, and there is a panoramic miracle of whales beaching that is staggering in its impact.<br />To this reviewer's eyes it is the skill of the Director Niki Caro that deserves the accolades being heaped on Keisha Castle-Hughes.  Yes, she performs well and is directed keenly and sympathetically by Caro through some lovely scenes, but is this &quot;performance&quot; really deserving of an Oscar when such brilliant actors such as Cate Blanchett, Nicole Kidman, Frances McDormand, etc etc have polished their craft through long commitment?  I wonder why all the need to grant an award to a child who hopefully will grow into such company.
B00064MW6K|1.0|Why is Catwoman a disappointment? Let's put things in perspective from a creative standpoint. Costing over $145 million dollars, this film based on one of DC comics' most popular characters has Halle Berry in the lead role wearing tight black leather fighting Sharon Stone. With all those elements in place you'd expect a top-notch film and not this poorly made disaster hated by comic fans and moviegoers worldwide.<br /><br />The primary reason this film is so bad is the screenplay. It took three writers to write this script and none of them earned the six figure salaries they probably got each for writing this dreck. The dialogue throughout the film is a bunch of clich&eacute;s and campy puns. The story comes together through a series of convenient coincidences, a Deus Ex Machina, and worst of all the movie starts with a flashback. These are several critical mistakes first-time screenwriters make, when trained professionals with credits under their belt continue to make the same errors it's just embarrassing. These three guys need to go back to school; they don't know anything about writing at all.<br /><br />Instead of adapting the great DC comic book character Selina Kyle and Gotham City, The plot revolves around Patience Phillips, a mousy Lake City resident who works at Hedare Cosmetics. She stumbles on the secret of Beau-line face cream and is killed by her boss. Left for dead, she's licked by a magical Egyptian Mau cat, becomes Catwoman, and goes out to seek revenge on her killers at the Hedare Corporation. Wearing a dominatrix outfit, this Catwoman is supposed to be the symbol of \\"21st Century\\" female empowerment; ironically the way she dresses and acts in this film Catwoman sets women back about five or six hundred years. After a series of incredibly stupid coincidences Detective Tom Lone (Inspector Gadget is smarter than this moron) figures out Patience the woman he's been dating is Catwoman and locks her up. But she escapes and has a yawner of a fight with Laurel Hedare now sporting Stone hard skin from the face cream she's been using. Catwoman lives to fight another day, but chances are she won't be using those nine lives in a sequel.<br /><br />First time French director Pitof's inept direction combined with the terrible script makes this film impossible to watch. His camerawork is fine for a fast paced music video or commercial, but not for a movie. The quick cutting camera moves so fast that you don't get a chance to see the story he's trying to tell. Worse, he cuts and pastes scenes from Spider-man, Dark Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Batman, and Smallville into his movie. I wanted to see some originality to his visuals instead of plagiarizing someone else's pictures to tell the story of Catwoman. Some advice to Pitof: First learn that movies are a visual medium where you tell an original story with pictures. Learn to master the craft then you can call yourself a pretentious one-word name.<br /><br />Production values for this film are terrible when you take into account the $145 million budget. Most of the money must have gone to salaries. The sets look like a cheesy TV cop show, and the costumes look like they came out of the Salvation Army dumpster. The CGI looks like that from a Playstation 1 console and the stunt work is bland. Berry can't work the whip at all; her movements show no confidence whatsoever.<br /><br />Halle Berry is gives the worst performance of her career. (SEE B.A.P.S for the now second worst.) She is awful as Patience, and horrid as Catwoman. Her big mistake was trying to copy Ertha Kitt's campy performance and not making the characters her own. Worse, she portrays Catwoman and Patience as one character; that's a big mistake. Actors must approach Superhero characters as two separate roles. Michelle Pfeiffer saw Catwoman and Selina as two distinct characters, that's what made her performance so unforgettable. Michael Keaton, Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire did this as well and gave amazingperformances. Benjamin Bratt could have put a cardboard cut out with a cell phone taped to it in most of his scenes, his performance is stiff and uninspired. Worse, he and Berry have NO chemistry. Sharon Stone shows us she hasn't grown as an actress; She's still playing everything like it's Basic Instinct. Sad. Alex Borstien isn't comic relief. She needs to stay on Family Guy. That's all I have to say. This Catwoman is kitty litter. Avoid it at all costs.t could have put a cardboard cut out with a cell phone taped to it in most of his scenes, his performance is stiff and uninspired. Worse, he and Berry have NO chemistry.

B0000W3YIS|1.0|She never could sing. In fact, she's never sung live outside of a studio. This album is horrendous despite the team of musicians and studio artists behind her. It's time to toss Britney in the discount bin with New Kids on the Block and N' Sync (who also never had any talent).
0790729652|5.0|Tim Burton's classic Batman revived the superhero movie genre in 1989. Burton's dark gritty vision of the dark knight is taken from the 1940's Batman comic, an iconic character who is a terrifying urban legend to the underworld of criminals. Burton's Gotham is a bleak place where there is no hope except for the protection provided by the mysterious Batman. He is the only force keeping the fragile city from tearing itself apart. In the opening scene we see how something as innocent as going to the movies in this town can become a terrifying experience in this town for both the family of victims and the superstitious cowardly lot of criminals.<br />Michael Keaton is perfectly cast as Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne. Keaton easily shifts between characters in this dual role, going from Batman's menacing presence to Bruce's Wayne's tormented spirit and his boyish charm. He gives a breakthrough performance here; this is the role that forced people to take his acting seriously. While many comic book fans complain about Burton's choice of casting Keaton to this day, I have no problems with it. He is clearly the best actor for the role available in 1989. We take for granted how Keaton becomes both characters and blends into the role so seamlessly. I doubt his contemporaries of the era (Kevin Costner, Kurt Russel, Sylvester Stallone, or Michael Douglas) would have blended into the role so well. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as his arch nemesis the Joker. The well-written story by Samm Hamm and Warren Skarren is loosely based on the golden age Batman from 1939. Batman patrols Gotham City while DA Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) is about to go after mob boss Carl Grissom (a great Jack Palance) so he sends his lieutenant Jack Napier to destroy the evidence at Axis chemichals. Bruce gets wind of this and goes into action as batman; Photographer Vicky Vale and Reporter Alexander Knox (Kim Basinger and a scene stealing Robert Wuhl) want to figure out the mystery of the bat. The story's first act ends with Jack Napier's tragic transformation into the joker.<br />The psychopathic Joker is bent on destroying Gotham City first by killing off Grissom and taking over his mob. He then uses Axis chemicals to produce smylex and as a \\"joke\\" he puts the lethal chemichal in household products unsuspecting consumers buy. Batman must figure out what themystery of the killer products is while trying to protect Vicky Vale from the advances of the joker. In the end of the second act, He gives Vale the information and the joker is foiled. However, the joker is obsessed with Vale and destroying Gotham. So in a final campaign to meet his goals, he has a party in Gotham Square where he plans on killing the populace with Smylex gas. Thankfully the batman is there to save the day in the thrilling conclusion.<br />Director Tim Burton does an excellent job in adapting the comic making sure the character fits the original dark vision of the late Batman creator Bob Kane. Comics Purists mistakenly complain that this Batman kills however, Burton's is true to his source material. In the Golden Age Batman did kill and in the original Batman #1 they did plan on killing the Joker before bringing him back to life in the last panel of the second Joker story. I highly recommend you own this film on VHS or DVD..

B000002LMM|4.0|I bought this CD when it was released - same day as some Guns &amp; Roses' release.  (I was the only one in the CD shop not buying the GnR...)  I think that was '91.  Anyway, I still love it, still listen to it.  A few of the tracks do wear a bit thin - it was a tv soundtrack, after all.  The others, however, well make up for the few slackers.  If you've made it as far as reading this review, buy the CD.  You will not regret it.
B000002MJC|4.0|Songs of Faith and Devotion is Depeche Mode's second official 90's release. The first being \\"Violator\\" released in early 1990. Violator is complimented by \\"Songs\\" quite well. <br />Where the previous album was more synthesizers, this one is more emphasized on guitars. The songwriting for Songs was also equally as crafted as on Violator. Again, DM teams with hit producer Flood (Mark Ellis) (who's worked with NIN, Pop Will Eat Itself, and U2 and produced Depeche Mode's Violator). Songs lives up to it's general idea as DM did with Violator.<br />A lot had changed in the music scene between 1990 and 1993. Unfortuantely, DM began to encounter problems with drugs and sex, and then the need to have those addcitions revealed and forgiven by God. This was mostly due to DM's obligation to behave as other groups during the early 90's grunge-movement so they could be just as \\"cool\\". In my opinion, they needent have done this since they already were cool.<br />\\"Rush\\" sounds like something that NIN helped record and is just as fast-paced and angry.<br />\\"Mercy in you\\" is my favorite song and feels more religous and inspiring than most artists could hope to be. Has that heavy-weighed synth which was evident during Halo.<br />\\"I feel you\\" sounds like a hard version of an INXS song. The guitars are put to the test here, just as they were with Personal Jesus.<br />\\"Walking in my Shoes\\" marks a scar for singer David Gahans pain of drug addiction at the time. Lyricist and Vocalist Martin Gore must've known just how he felt too.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is a great album. It shows the change they went through over the years.<br /><br />Piper At The Gates Of Dawn was basically all Syd, but signs of what was to come were there. The organ on \\"Flaming\\" is like the opening of \\"Us And Them.\\" Syd's guitar left them with the reminder to never let the rock stray.<br /><br />A Saucerful Of Secrets showed many signs, the group were maturing as songwriters.<br /><br />More was a chance to try something different. It gave them time to spread their wings.<br /><br />Ummagumma was a new experiment. Live and solo work. This gave everybody a chance to branch out.<br /><br />Atom Heart Mother was an attempt at avant garde; verrry diff.<br /><br />Then there's Meddle, so much like Dark Side of The Moon, in fact \\"Brain Damage\\" was written during the Meddle sessions. It was originally called \\"Dark Side of The Moon.\\" The sonic textures between Dark Side and Meddle are so similar. Echoes is brilliant, \\"Us And Them Part One.\\" Get this first, then get Dar Side. Play them one after the other, see what I mean.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|I love this CD. Manu Chau has the gift to make you happy!! I really enjoy the fact that he sings in so many different languages and the beats are always really energetic and fun.<br />I don't have any other of his CDs but i really think that i will buy more.<br />Some of my favorite songs are &quot;Me gustas Tu&quot;, &quot;Merry Blues&quot; and &quot;Rendez-vous&quot;.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This music is amazing! I loved the movie and the first time I saw it I noticed the beautiful music. I decided right then that I would own the soundtrack. I bought it for myself for Christmas and I have listened to it every day since then. The music is so moving I almost cried! I have never heard anything so beautiful and I would give anything if I could play it. I guess I'll be buying the score next!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have read &quot;Wicked&quot; the book, and I wish I lived in New York to go see the musical. Or I wish it would come here to Denver, but I dont think it will. Anyways. I first heard about the Musical in the paper a few months ago before they made it and then I saw on the Internet that it came out and had been doing well for several months. I was ecstatic and wanted to buy tickets here in Denver :( So I thought the next best thing was to buy the soundtrack. Let me tell you! I love the Wizard of OZ, the movie, the books, Wicked, and now I love the soundtrack! It took a few listens to realize how great they were but by the third time I was humming and blasting it through my dorm, taking to class with me, and sharing it with my friends. If you like the &quot;Wicked&quot; book, the Wizard of OZ Books and Movie then you definetely love this Soundtrack!
0156027321|5.0|This book has been praised for a lot of reasons. However, there is something unique about the authors understanding of various religions. I just read a review by a Muslim reader commending the authors understanding of that religion. I,myself, was amazed at Martel's one page summary of Hinduism. It could not have been better. I was truly amazed at the description because such an understanding was not a result of a cursory effort. The author's view could only have emerged after making a serious attempt to understand the religion. I would even say that most Hindus would never have viewed the truth of their religion as Martel has done. His understanding of the Hindu Divinity in its two forms; with and without attributes is the very core of understanding the religion and explains the co-mingling of religious symbols and deep spiritual philosophies.<br />To end on a bitter note, I was amazed that inspite of such a profound understanding of India, the author made a huge blunder. How could he name his Muslim mentor Satish Kumar. It would be akin to calling a Christian, Mohammed!!. I thought the name was an error, but then the author goes on to insist on the similarity of the name with that of his Zoology teacher!...adding insult to injury!!...<br />Nevertheless, one of the best books ever.
B000096I9G|5.0|What a great Concert! which covered the 3 best albums that they have made. I have seen them in concert twice and I can tell you from experience that they are excellent in concert and they have so much energy throughout the tracks that they play. The music from all 3 sets has so much energy and crispness that it feels like you are watching them live. The disintegration and bloodflowers are my favorite albums from the cure and when they play them live they sound even better than the CDs themselves. The extras with the interviews were great. Anybody that is a cure fan will enjoy this.
6305508550|5.0|this is the most amazing movie ever written. Bottom line. The cast is great. the actors are faboulous and jennifer anniston is lookin quite attractive. Not a dull moment the whole time. ITS THAT AMAZING
B0000CEB62|5.0|When I first heard they were going to release 101 on dvd it brought memories when my friend and I would watch the movie over and over again because we were big DM fans. Well the movie is still great on DVD and the sound is excellent compared to how it was on VHS. The extras are great especially the interviews with the band and with some of the kids in the movie. Overall, if you are a DM fan this is a must buy for you.
0385504209|3.0|If this is an intelligent mystery, intelligence is losing ground.  The writing was awkward, many of the riddles were predictable, and the religious theories were heavy-handed.  The book was a little too much like a rambling manifesto of conspiracy theory; its passing mention of minor symbolic points (The suits in a deck of cards are symbols of the sacred feminine!) detracted from the force of the more interesting points about religious iconography.
B00005JLWN|5.0|My gosh! I wish I could use a gun like that!! I love Equilibrium. I've shown it to all my friends, and I have not had anyone come up to me and tell me &quot;That was a waste of time&quot; I love the story line. I feel that everyone in this movie did a wonderful acting job. Awesome Action scenes. If you like the matrix you'll love this movie!
B00004Z459|1.0|Any depressed 7th grader could write this crap.  It sucks.
B000001ELR|4.0|Kiss are at their loudest!  A combination of great mastering, writing, and performing helped this thunderous record take loud to new levels.  Even the songs one ballad, &quot;I Still Love You&quot; is louder than most of the &quot;heavier&quot; songs on other Kiss releases.<br />It may not be the &quot;original&quot; lineup, but based on some of the not-so-Kiss material that showed up on the preceeding few materials, it could be that this change was needed.  We all love Peter Criss and Ace Frehley, but there are obvious reasons why they left the fold.<br />This may be the last start-to-finish-good Kiss album to come along, with the possible exception of Revenge.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Back in my old 70's college days I played this album (on vinyl) for many people and they were ALWAYS blown away.  This CD is a no brainer.  I did my part to try to spread the magic.  Michael Schenker plays guitar like a man possessed.  Flat out some of the best soloing you'll ever hear.  Fast, melodic, perfect.  The rest of the band...yeah yeah they're good too.  But MS, man he is incredible!!!  5 stars is not enough.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This album is insane. Rage delivers again with their strong politically fueled lyrics and Tom Morrello's wicked guitar playing. This is right up there with Nirvana's Nevermind as one of the best albums released in the 90's
B0000TB050|5.0|This concert dvd is superior to the Boston Dvd for 4 reasons:<BR>1) Most important of all, Bono's voice is at 100% this time making the whole thing much more enjoyable. <BR>2) The crowd and the energy of the concert are impressive.<BR>3) The track listing this time is far better, New Year's Day, Mysterious WAys are included, and surprises like Out of control, Angel of HArlem and All I want is you, with the full band. <BR>4) The band seems to truly be &quot;into&quot; this concert, they look alive and happy, and this special energy is transmitted through their instruments as well.
B00011RPB0|5.0|There are many ways to look at this bouquet of a film. There is the city of Tokyo in its shiny, immeasurable brilliance. There is the advent of a star being born, Scarlett Johansson. There is the loopy, loose script that--while imperfect--hardly impedes on the breathtaking, panoramic view of the Japanese capital and the two tiny foreigners who run around in it.<br />But most of all there is Bill Murray, smoldering and chuckling in what must be the pinnacle of his far-too-long-overlooked career. One of the strengths (counterintuitively) of this film is that there's too little of him on screen. We wonder about this fascinating character Murray creates, wanting to dig deeper, to understand more and better. And yet the film resists, cleverly leaving Murray's washed-up-but-still-crackling fading movie star as one of the most enigmatic screen personages to come out of Hollywood in the last quarter-century.<br />A sequel might well be a travesty (you'll understand once you see the film), but audiences worldwide would certainly cheer for another slice of this compelling if relunctant character.

0156027321|4.0|Piscine, pronounced \\"pee-seen,\\" means \\"pool\\" in French.  It bears devastating similarity to the English word \\"pissing,\\" devastating, that is, for the main character of Yann Martel's Life of Pi, Piscine Patel.  The resulting jeers from classmates during Piscine's early schooling are the first tests of his identity in this fictional autobiographical account.  Upon entrance into a new school environment, Piscine firmly declares himself \\"Pi\\" and assumes the improved identity that goes with his new name.  <BR> Another test of identity comes in the form of choosing which religion to follow.   Pi, whose family is not very religious, gradually accepts not only his parents' traditional religion, Hindu, but also Christianity and Islam as his own.  Though his family is uncomfortable and the religious leaders are concerned with his choice, Pi stays fast.  Both his declarations of name and religion paint his portrait - a cliff, solid against the ocean's surf.  <BR> The ocean itself soon would test Pi's resolve.  His father decides to move the family from their native India to Canada.  A year later, Pi awakes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in a cargo ship with most of the animals in the family zoo.  The animals are headed for American zoos.  Pi and his brother, Ravi, counting themselves in that number, believe, in addition, that \\"two animals [are] being shipped to the Canada Zoo,\\" (88).  This metaphor broadly outlines the story with two grand questions:  What is a zoo?  And what is an animal?  <BR> Two animals dominate the main body of Pi's story, himself and a Bengal tiger.  The ship is gone, its space shrunken to the dimensions of a lifeboat.  The sea, however, has not become smaller.  Instead of beating against Pi the impenetrable cliff, it now rocks his tiny boat.  At the mercy of these waves, he learns how to survive with a tiger.<BR> Martel's prose dances like light on water.  He infuses Pi's reflections with humor, and his scenes with life.  One such scene occurs whenleaders of the three religions Pi adopts converge on him and his family on the shore of the Bay of Bengal:<BR>My parents looked puzzled to have their way gently blocked by three broadly smiling religious strangers...The priest... said, with pride in his voice, \\"Piscine is a good Christian boy.\\"... \\"You must be mistaken.  He's a good Muslim boy...\\" said the imam...  The pandit spoke.  \\"You're both wrong.  He's a good Hindu boy.\\"... The three wise men stared at each other, breathless and disbelieving.  Lord, avert their eyes from me, I whispered in my soul.  All eyes fell upon me. (65-66)<BR>This heartwarmingly embarrassing scene is a novel way for Martel to introduce Pi's religious pluralism to his parents.  Although the conflicts between the men hold deep meaning for the rest of the story, they are not cast in the heavy, ponderous shadow in which more traditional books reveal symbols.  <BR> The contrast between how heavy the story could be and how lightly it is portrayed is one of the most innovative characteristics of this novel.  At times, it fosters a healthy sense of hope and well-being.  But sometimes it is the source of a sickening load of situational irony.  For example, Martel's colorful imagery makes more terrible the grisly sight of a tiger eating its prey.  The thirst and hunger of days without food and water made themselves felt inside my own mouth and stomach, yet I could also see thousands of glimmering fish swimming in cities below the lifeboat.<BR> The duality of the tiger and the boy (never mind the countless marine life) creates an austere dialogue.  This is a book, rather, for people who enjoy introspection.  It is akin to Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea but with less single-minded intent and more wondering, soul-searching moments.  Like the old man, however, Pi always returns to the stark reality of living on the ocean with a dangerous animal.  <BR> Like the unexpected swipe of a tiger, an unsettling plot twist near the end multiplies the impact of the story.  Again, the two grand questions are asked (What is a zoo?  And what is an animal), but the ending adds this:  And does it matter?  In this way, Martel successfully ties the bow on his gift to the reader of survival, self-discovery, and faith.  I highly recommend Life of Pi for the number of issues addressed by and enveloped within its plot.  <BR>After I finished the book, I stared out the window to my room and thought.  I was wrapped in the heat of the unbridled sun, woozy with vertigo from the depths of water below my small craft.  Martel created those sensations for me through the eyes of Pi, and I dove through them, into the ocean I had not yet taken time to contemplate - my own life.

B000000JO3|5.0|Like everyone else, this album changed my life, too. It's full of emphasis, ideas, and strong, healthy ethics. <br />To be honest, when I first heard it back in 2000 (over the stereo in a coffeehouse), I started to laugh...not because I thought it was stupid but the fast, tight, music and McKaye's yelling somehow struck me as entertaining. Sonically, it was all such a great combination. Just funnier than I was used to, y'know?<br />So when I decided to buy the album, the lyrics and morals soon started to sink in as time went by. My life as a $300/week working-class loner dragged on, and I used this album for therapy...therapy for my depressions, money frustration, and annoyances with my loud, obnoxious middle-aged office co-workers who gripe at nothing but the 'stupidity' of their husbands and 'ignorance' of their kids. (They supposedly hated dealing with them...and they couldn't wait to come back for more). I could do nothing but listen. But I listened hard and with tears.<br />I'm 32 and my heart remains of the 60s and 70s music. But this band kinda woke me up from those dark states into a DIY way of thinking.  <br />2000 sucked. All I wanted was Stevie Wonder, The Beach Boys, and Black Sabbath. But Minor Threat came in halfway through and there were times that I needed them as much as the other three put together. It really made me sweat and think. Helped get me through.

B00008GKEG|5.0|When I first saw the Anthology series on TV I was disappointed.  I thought it was half-hearted.  I'm glad that I bought the DVDs because the expanded dialogue adds a lot of warmth.  There are some great stories that I'd never heard an the extended version.  It's too bad that John wasn't around to add his take, but the way his dialogue is cut gives the illusion that he is right there narrating with the other guys.  This is a must own DVD set!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was watching the extended DVD edition the other day and it was an interview with Peter Jackson and he said that the Two Towers was the most difficult movie to do because of the books and the way Tolkien wrote them well i really enjoyed the way they rearranged things all around it was the greatest movie i have seen up to date but i am sure the return of the king will have something to say about that
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Wow i really like this album because she is incorporating different stuff in her songs and not just piano piano all the time. This time around she does use piano in almost all her songs, but is used in a different way then like in her first album (which kinda bored me). Songs to look for are ones like U Don't Know My Name, Diary, If I Ain't Got You, and So Simple(I really like this one).Great album!
B000002J03|5.0|this is jimmy pages cd, from start to finish. page shines throughout. you also get to hear the brilliant john bonham perform a solo on moby dick, good stuff. i think the the musical theme on the cd is straight up rock. not as much blues as the first cd. radio stapples whole lotta love, heartbreaker, and livin' lovin' maid appear. one of my personal favorites that often seems to be overlooked is bring it on home. great song. great harmonica playin which breaks into killer guitar. led zeppelin II is a great cd for new fans to get into zep. highly recommended.
B0000VD04M|5.0|So, fans of this movie wait and wait and wait... and finally we hear that the DVD will appear in stores on February 3. And now that release has been cancelled/delayed/taken off the schedule?!? Does anyone know why? <br />Grrr...
B00005KFUM|5.0|I picture Muse's Matthew Bellamy rockin' out to Radiohead, Supergrass and Coldplay, all the while trying on his old Queen concert T's.  Not since Freddie Mercury has anyone attacked music with such panache!<br />Less cerebral than Thom Yorke and crunching harder than either Supergrass or Coldplay, Muse is a band that really hits its stride with this disc.  I guess since it doesn't fit anywhere near the decrepit state of U.S. radio, it will remain Britain's best kept secret.  Which is truly a shame, since songs this emotionally and physically brilliant should be unleashed upon the entire world.
B0001906O0|4.0|I was excited when I heard that The Cure were going to put this together and release it this year.  After listening to this I was not disappointed, but this is definitely not for novice Cure fans.  To be honest this is really just for completists or Cure buffs that couldn't get hold of all their singles and soundtrack songs.  They save us the trouble of looking for them and just put them all on 4 discs.  I suppose my gripe is that they didn't include Forever (a popular concert encore in Europe especially), Spilt Milk, Carnage Visors, I'm A Cult Hero and I Dig You.  I know that's nitpicking but I want all of their unreleased or hard to find songs on this box set.  The overall quality of the b-sides are pretty good and pretty bad, its easy to see why some of them are leftovers. <br />     I wouldn't put The Cure's b-sides on the same level as say The Smiths or Suede but more on a par with Echo & The Bunnymen and New Order.  There are some absolute gems here like; This Twilight Garden, Burn, It Used To Be Me, More Than This, Halo, Harold & Joe, Another Journey By Train, I'm Cold and Coming Up.  While Do The Hansa is the funniest song in the whole set.  I know that most diehard Cure fans will just put 5 stars to show support for their favorite band (mine as well) but 5 stars is reserved for Pornography, Faith and Disintegration.  I realize that the people throw 5 stars around like its nothing and unfortunately it de-values its true deserved review.  I give Join The Dots 4 stars because they're b-sides and that's better than most bands A material, but the quality of songs do not overshadow the A-sides.  Only a select few need to get this.  If you want a proper introduction to The Cure then get \\"Staring At The Sea\\" and \\"Disintegration\\".  If you're a Cure buff like myself and want their rare songs then this is essential.
B00005Y6YB|3.0|I clicked the more technical details on this page and it says that this movie is 240 minutes long.<BR>Only four hours long for an original mini-series that was eight hours long?<BR>So what happened to the rest of this classic mini-series?
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I am generally very fussy about sound and I just don't get all the beefs and complaints about the sound of this disc.  People, this sounds fine!  Geddy's voice is a maybe a little low in the mix for the first couple of songs but I thinks it's primarily because the fans are singing just as loud as he is!  The energy the crowd adds to this show is unique among any live albums I have.  It really adds something special.  The drum sound here is the best of any live Rush album, and I really like Alex's guitar sound as well.  It's much thicker and heavier than on Different Stages for example.  This disc sounds like a real Rush show, and having seen them many times live, that's a good thing.
B00000GBHA|5.0|I grew up in South Africa and bought this LP in the 70's.  When I moved to the States 8 years ago I could not believe that no one here has even heard of him. Unbelievable!! He has got to be the most incredible singer/song writer I have ever heard. He was an icon in our High School and I can't think of one person in SA who doesn't have his Cold Fact album.  I hope and pray that he will tour the USA and I would do anything to see him perform.  Another unknown artist from Texas is Shawn Phillips, who is equally talented.<br />Rodriguez, Shawn you rock!!
B0000UJL96|5.0|This movie is an excellent send off to the original cast and the bonus features on the dvd are spectacular.
0380789019|5.0|i have only recently discovered neil gaiman, and being an avid reader i am extremely glad i did (even if i wish i had found him years ago).  this work is a post-modern novel that is purely brilliant in its mode and tone.  gaiman writes more for the fan than for the critic, but the critic can't look away from him works.<br />neverwhere is a story of a young and confused protagonist by the name of richard mayhew.  he is sucked into the underworld of london and thus is thrust into a journey that he is at first reluctant to take, but eventually embraces.  during the journey he is forced to come to grips with his own apathy and fears he had never known before.<br />if you are a sucker for a gripping story and characters that are rich and vivid, then this is your book.  if you are looking to be bored out of your mind, then look elsewhere!
0800141601|4.0|As you can see, I am a Chinese. I happened to see this movie on TV. Although I am not a professor on European history, I learnt something about the Legend of King Arthur before. However, I have to say, this movie, First Knight, gave me a new idea about this legend figure. Undoubtedly, it is not the true history. However, as far as I am concerned, I think it is a good movie, which did impress me a lot. <br />First, and the most important, is the theme of the movie. I consulted the encyclopedia and found that Lancelot, to some degree, was an amorous but mean person. His behavior eventually divided Camelot. However, in the movie, everything changed. Lancelot was still an amorous person, but he was not a mean person. He loved Guinevere, but after understanding Arthur himself and the order of Camelot, he changed and was ready to sacrifice himself. He became a knight not only because of Guinevere actually, but also the order of Camelot and the will to seek for freedom. Actually, the movie does not only tell us a love story, but the spirit of freedom as well. This deepened the main idea of the movie. <br />On the other hand, Guinevere¡¯s understanding of love is also very meaningful. As she said, the true love must be based on trust. If you love some one, you must love him or her with your body, heart and soul. From my point of view, the theme of a movie is the most important factor to me. I think the theme of this movie is significant. <br />At last is the movie itself. If you choose to watch movie in order to experience the fierce battle field in medieval age, probably that is not a good decision. For one thing, the movie itself does not focus on the battle field, but the atmosphere of the war and the dialogues among person, which helps to highlight the theme of the movie. For another, the scenery and the background of the movie are marvelous. <br />To make a conclusion, if I am in Lancelot's position and situation, probably I will do the same thing that he did. Although someone thought that Lancelot should be a better person, I disagree. I do not want to see a fantastic hero, but a sincerity person. Some others thought the movie should pay more attention on other knights. In my opinion, the main characters are Lancelot, the king and queen but not others. Considering the beautiful scenery of Camelot and the perfect performance of Sean Connery, I want to give the movie my highest recommendation. <br />\\"Yet some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our lord Jesus into another place; and men say that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I will not say that it shall be so, but rather I will say, here in this world he changed his life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb this verse: Hic iacet arthurus, Rex quondam rexque futurus.\\" (Latin for \\"here lies Arthur, the once and future king.\\") (Excerpt from Le morte d'Arture, Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2004) The movie does not tell the history, but it will remind the legend of the king.
0380789035|5.0|i have read some of the reviews of gaiman's novel and it is hard for me to understand why so many negative comments have been made.  this novel is a deep and literate work that delves into the life of a man who is otherwise lost in his own vices.  shadow, the central character, is not 2-dimensional as others might have you believe.  rather, he is a fully fleshed-out character who rolls through life's harsh realities building his character and personality as he goes.<br />american gods blends fantasy, historical fiction, mythology, and science fiction with an ease that shouldn't be possible.  any fan of stephen king would probably find a kindred spirit in the writing of neil gaiman.  gaiman obviously enjoys what he does as he molds every character with a love of one who feels on the same level as his creations.  he creates rich characters who are neither 2-dimensional nor boring.  he fully molds them to pop out of the pages and give a sense of meaning to a beautiful work of fiction.<br />to those who love a great read, pick this up, and enjoy!
B000002UYZ|4.0|if you're just getting interested in the beatles and have a preferance in music too diverse to get all the albums of any particular band you like (as plenty of reviewers seem to recommend when reviewing any greatest hits compilation) then you're in the same possition I was a month ago. The solution? well, seeing as how they're the biggest band EVER I decided I'd make an exception to my &quot;1 CD per artist&quot; rule and bought both this and 67-70. If you can afford to do this go for it! but if you really only want 1 beatles CD, get 67-70. It's pure genius
B00008OWZC|5.0|I have loved Led Zeppelin since my college years.  Listening to these beautifullly restored bootlegs takes me back to my big hair days.  Ahhh...what is more precious? Enjoying this special time with the most improtant rockers of the 20th century?  Or reliving my days gone by?  Either way, it's fun to kick back, open my ears and my memories, and enjoy.  If but for a moment, I am once again 21 years old, the biggest groupie to my boyfriend's college band, the girl with the biggest blonde hair, and the party housemate with the most Led Zeppelin posters of anyone on campus...

B00005JM02|5.0|I really had no intention buying or renting this movie until a friend let us borrow it.  Then I decided to sit down and watch it and I really like it!  I just got done watching it for the 3rd time so far.  I'm going to be 21 years old next month and I still watch cartoons.  After I return this movie to my friend, I'm definently gonna add it to my DVD Wish List.  It deserves a place in my collection!
B00000JY1X|4.0|This is, first and foremost, a massive collection of love songs in what sounds like a Broadway-musical-attempt at including dozens of different musical styles into a single performance.  Stephin Merritt himself remarks, in the included booklet (a transcript of an interview with him conducted by Daniel Handler, aka Lemony Snicket), that this was originally envisioned as a sort of competitive musical review to be performed by non-musicians with prizes given out each night to whoever the audience liked best.  <br />To sum up all almost-seventy songs in one review is impossible, to cover three discs that could each stand alone as an album in one review is unfair.  <br />To say that this album is the most accurate musical representation of love, however, would be very clever and very accurate.  There are songs here that will make you giggle with glee, there are songs that will astound you with their sweeping beauty, there are songs that will almost frighten you with the way they mirror something from your own life, and there are even a few songs that will annoy the hell out of you.  <br />To pick one song from the whole thing as an icon of the entire set would not be the best idea, but possible.  &quot;The Book of Love,&quot; as it refers to a large,unwieldy tome full of all the esoterica and errata of courtship and affection and refers to it, even the bad parts, rather fondly.
B000001F3C|5.0|I wish I could write a review as beautiful and poignant as this record is, but I'm afraid I can't.  &quot;War&quot; is a transcendent album, one whose gorgeous aesthetic is not laid bare but rather merely suggested by the Edge's ethereal guitar washes, Bono's feathery voice, and the rhythm section's passionate rumblings.  Not as immediate or accesible as the band's later material, &quot;War&quot; is nevertheless a breathtaking statement.  It seamlessly disguises fiery anger and passion beneath serene melodies; it rails against war and oppression, not in a contrived fashion but in a poetic manner that perfectly suits this album's skyscraping grandeur.  Its songs, which include the unforgettable &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; the stormy &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&quot; the unspeakably beautiful &quot;Drowning Man,&quot; and the heavenly &quot;40,&quot; seem to race past in a blur of brilliance.  The Edge's skeletal guitar work is unbelievable--he proves just how much one can do with a handful of tuneful chords and archipeggios and a grain of determination.  Contrasting with the guitarscapes are Larry Mullen's marching drums, which were recorded beneath a staircase to provide a particularly fiery edge.  Yet &quot;War&quot;'s key strength is its undying restraint; it never says too much or too little, instead hovering somewhere in the clouds and saying everything poignant that must be said.  This is definitely one of my top five albums of all-time, and one that anyone with a heart should own.
B00004LN16|1.0|Why did I buy this cd?? It is so bad that I gave it to my grandma, she then burned it on top of the rest of my worthless acdc collection chanting &quot;BURN SATAN,BURN. This brougt a smile to my face:)<br />dont buy, avoid like the plague.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|I got a good deal on this movie from DVDSpree_com and they shipped it fast
6302800927|1.0|I would have enjoyed Stand By Me so much more if the profanity had been missing but Hollywood is under a delusion, that there are only two types of kids, the cheerful boy scout type that jon provost enventually became in time as the Lassie tv series went on and the smart mouth brat type, believe me hollywood kids vocabulary is not limited to golly, geewilikers, thank you mam or up yours you motherf----. In 1959 and especially in Oregon kids may not have talked like beaver cleaver but they certainly didnt talk the way kids did in Stand By Me but like I say its a delusion Hollywood is under unless somebody says cut the b.s. the movie will get a g -rating and hollywood assumes all g rated films have to be like mary poppins with everyone smiling and singing, which is false
B00005JKHN|5.0|I was very young when Sleeping Beauty first came out and I was an addict since then!<BR>I think the drawing style is much better than the new Disney animations. It has a very unique style and as far as I can remember Disney never repeated that technique.<br />Basically &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is the classical story that we all get to know from bed time stories, there is nothing different about the story. Although it is pretty old, the DVD is very clear and the sounds is very good! I was very pleased with it.<BR>I think Maleficent, the evil witch is Disney's best villain yet [second is Scar from Lion King]. Very unique and not-so-classical-Disney style.<BR>Also the musics are amazing.<br />A must-have DVD for Disney and real animation fans! Especially if you haven't seen it before, and also for collectors. You will like the nostalgic aura of Sleeping Beauty...
B0000028MA|5.0|This was one of the first albums (I got it on cassette) which I ever bought, back when I was about 15 or so in 1992. I had been listening to the radio for a year or so, hearing all those &quot;grunge&quot; sounds coming out of Seattle at the time. This became my favorite for 1992, and whenever I hear any of these songs these days it instantly takes me back to my teenage years, as awkward as they may have been, just because of the newness of the whole thing. So far as I can tell this was the last big &quot;scene&quot; in rock, to break at a national level. At the time, everyone was wearing flannels and faded jeans (I was no exception). Not all of the music has held up (I'd cite Alice in Chains as sounding more dated than the rest but maybe I just personally don't like the sound), but much of it sounds even better to me now than it did back then. The Chris Cornell solo track is very passionate and soulful (why didn't he just go solo back then??) and the Pearl Jam songs are better than anything I have heard on their albums.  Basically, this is the only early-90s rock compilation you'll ever need, it has everything and as some reviewers pointed out, no filler. Even a throw-back to the best stuff from the 80s, with Paul Westerberg of the Replacements contributing a few great tracks. By the way, as this soundtrack gets so much press on its own, see the movie too! It's great, and now that I'm a few years short of 30 I appreciate it more.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck has joined Mark Lanegan as a co-conspirator in delivering sorrow and reflection upon our loveless lives. All the hurts are there. The relationship gone bad, the enmity towards the world. After lsitening to this, i felt an odd craving for a 40 ounce bottle of Jack Daniels to help me see the world in a more positive light! Seriously folks, this is depressing stuff. Becks sadness can be felt on every note. Every string hits a new tone in despair. This recording just reeks of it. The production is top notch. The running order of the songs is irrelevant. Each track is one tug at the heartstrings after another. This album is a gloomier and darker version of 'mutations'. If those two records were made in the same house, One was by the big window in the living room with the sun shining in (give or take a dark cloud or two such as 'nobodies fault but my own') and the other was done in the basement with dripping pipes and flickering lightbulbs. Guess which spot this record was done in? <br />Especially coming after the upbeat feel of 'Midnight Vultures', this album is a slap in the face to love, hope and happiness. I think Beck needs to go out there and spend those millions and make his pain go away. Or maybe not. I kind of like the music better this way. Good stuff but if your heart is already gloomy, this will slay any remaining hope you may have. 'Round the Bend' might just be darkest day music has ever known.
0553573403|4.0|This book was great.  To you nay-sayer Tolkien fanatics who complain about similar names, SHUT UP!  HE'S PAYING HOMAGE TO TOLKIEN, WHO IS BY THE WAY, UNDESERVING OF HOMAGE PAID BY A REAL AUTHOR!  JUST AS HIS WORK WAS UNWORTHY OF PETER JACKSON'S ATTENTION!<br />Now that we have that out of the way I can say that despite the homage to Tolkien, this is a book that, unlike LOTR, is worthy of our time and money (it's also far better than the Hobbit, which was Tolkien's only work worth reading).  The characters are actually interesting, where Tolkien got so bogged down in detail I couldn't even remember who the character's were.  There was even a character that we got attached to before he was born (Rhaego), and when he was still-born it broke our hearts (he was prophesied to be a great war leader, known as &quot;The Stallion who will mount the world&quot;).<br />While the names are Tolkien's, the writing style is in homage to none other than the great Frank Herbert, even some plot events are Herbertish (and from what I've read about future books it will continue that way), although this story is unique.  I would even call this story a grand assault on Fantasy, in an attempt to drive out the Tolky's, and give followers of Frank Herbert control of the Genre.  I think the assault should have taken place after getting Scifi firmly under control (Lucas followers still control it, but I don't hate them, even if they are somewhat dumb their entertaining), but so long as Tolkien get's run out of town.<br />Why then did I not give it a perfect rating.  One reason, to much focus on Eddard.  It's so similar to Dune I knew from the beggining Eddard's fate would be that of Duke Leto, and why do I want to read from the point of someone I can tell already is going to die.  Other than that flawless.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Snatch was reccomended to me by a good friend. I must admit being a little skeptical about a Guy Ritchie film since the dud &quot;Swept Away.&quot; I was suprised by Snatch, because it's an awesome film.<br />Snatch is a bunch of stories within a big story. You've got a stolen diamond that no one can seem to hold on to, underground boxing, gangs, and what modern gangst tail wouldn't have the russian and some ex kgb. Snatch has it all and it's fun wathcing each story develop in the film.<br />Guy Ritchie wrote and directed this one and he has made some excellent characters. You gotta love Brad Pitt's characther Micky the gypsy barefisted boxing champions. Jason Statham is great as Turkish the boxing promoter who things just go bad for. There are a lot of other fun characters in the movie and that's where the driving part of the movie comes from.<br />Snatch is a great film. I liked it a lot and would reccomend it to just about everybody. Fans of British humor will really get a kick out of it, and so will Brad Pitt fans. He does a great job in the film. I own the film and I'm glad to say I do.
6300163423|1.0|During most of the time of this supernatural thriller, Mickey Rourke`s character is looking for a missing person and in order to achieve her he must enter some dangerous and risky places. Director Alan Parker manages to create a tense mood and atmosphere in some moments, but the result is still tedious and dull, whose only non-boring parts are the long and unecessary sex scene and the obvious, poorly conceived and ridiculous ending. <BR>\\"Angel Heart\\" is a flat, uninteresting movie that lacks in substance, entertainment, tension and credibility. A snoozer.
B000002J5K|5.0|Blues Brothers was an excellent movie and one of the things that made it so awesome was the spectacular music. Fans that loved the music must pick this up.<br />What other soundtracks have artists like Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, and James Brown on it. That alone should be a selling point to fans of oldies and blues music. You also get to hear Jon Belushi and Dan Akroyd singing as Jake and Elwood.<br />Almost all the songs from the movie are on the soundtrack. It's got the theme from &quot;Rawhide&quot; which was the only song they put on it that the band sang in the bar. I wish they would have put &quot;Stand By Your Man&quot; on it, but that's the only knock I have against this classic soundtrack. Pick this one up, you'll like it.
0156027321|5.0|This is a great book with a great central character. It starts with a teenage boy's quest for a connection to the divine. He is considered an oddity as he is a practicing Christian, Muslim and Hindu (all at once). The story gets interesting when this zoo director's son escapes a sinking ship and finds himself in a lifeboat shared by an orangutan, a hyena and a tiger.<br />Pi and the tiger co-habitate in the small lifeboat for seven and a half months. When finally landing on the coast of Mexico, Pi gives two explanations for his amazing survival. You, the reader, must decide which is truth.<br />A great tapistry of thought, insight, adaptability in adversity, and story telling.
B0000C1733|5.0|You know when a band has been around as long as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and put out as many albums as they have, your gonna get a greatest hits album. Well for all RHCP fans it's finally here.<br />The Chili Peppers have had some big hits over the years. Songs like Under the Bridge, Californication, Give It Away, Suck My Kiss, Parrael Universe, Scar Tissue, and By The Way are some of the many hits the band has had. All of them are on this album and really does contain all their hit songs new and old.<br />I don't see why people are so pissed over this album. It's exactly what it says it is a Greatest Hits album. All of these songs helped make the band big and got huge radio play. I'm glad to say I own this album and I hope the Red Hot Chili Peppers never stop making great music.
B0001906O0|3.0|I'm 21 years old and I got into The Cure VERY recently .A few days ago , I went to my casual CD store to buy Disintegration . There , the owner of the shop started playing Join The Dots . One by one , three customers asked him what he was playing . I was really surprised because that doesn't often happen ; usually in that kind of store , people avoid showing how ignorant they are and think twice before asking anything to the owner . So I ended up buying Join The Dots instead of Disintegration .<br />From a fan point of view , since all the B-sides of The Cure are collected here , this box would rightly deserve five stars . If you want the B-Sides , you've got them ; whether you like 'em or not doesn't really matters . That's what being a fanatic is all about after all .<br />But let's take those songs for what they are : frankly , even though some are quite interesting , you won't bother listening to most of them more than once . But more or less , thirteen songs here are excellent . If The Cure had released an album of their best B-sides , it would have been one of their greatest and would have even got a Top 40 hit : 2 Late , a joyful pop single that couldn't fit with Disintegration's mood and was consequently left over . <br />Only die-hard fans will like Join The Dots as a whole , but everyone can enjoy the perfect Cure LP hidden here : a great single , a good cover , a couple of experimental tracks and other incredibly good rock songs would have certainly be one of the greatest records of 2004 .
B0000UJL96|5.0|Star Trek films have been big blockbusters in hollywood for over 20 years now and this is the best one they've ever done.<br />Star Trek VI was really a breath of fresh air for the movie franchise. V really stunk and was a bad made movie. The whole thing with god was bad and Spocks brother made a bad movie experience.<br />Star Trek VI reunited the franchise with director Nicholas Meyer who did Star Trek II which is the second best Trek film ever done. Once again the crew of the Enterprise has been asked to save the galaxy. The klingon empire is dying and they need help. The chancelor of the klingon empire however is murdered and Kirk is the accused. It's now up to the crew to save him and prevent interstellar war.<br />The original cast is all awesome in this film. You see plent of the big three in Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly all had such great chemistry with each other and looked real close. The tribute to Kelly on this DVD is nice. All three have great performances as does the rest of the crew. It's sad to see a good thing like that end. It was such a humble start to a show that is now a multi billion dollar franchise. I don't think any of those guys thought when they started this show in the 60's that 10 movies and four spin offs would have come from it.<br />Star Trek VI is a great film. You don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to like it, you just won't appreciate it as much. You can't be a trekkie and not have this film.
B000002H2H|5.0|The first album I think of when I think of 80's Metallica is Ride the Lightning.  The title track and Fade to Black were the first metal songs I heard, way back in 7th grade, and, after listening those to songs for a while I bought the album.  Then i got attached to Master of Puppets, and after that ...And Justice for All, and then i stopped listening to Metallica for a while.  I listened to Sabbath and Zepplin for a while, then I switched to some Bob Marley, and then some Hendrix, Stones, et al.  Finally, after 2-3 years I have picked up listening to the three aforementioned Metallica albums, and, after listening to a considerable amount of all three, I decided that this was  my favorite Metallica album.  But then, on another day, I felt like listening to the harmonized bridge of Blackened from AJFA.  And later I was obsessed with the crunch of Disposable Heroes from Master of Puppets.  But even after all of that hedging from album to album, I still think that RTL is the most easy to listen to, if not the best metallica album.<br />While Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for all are both excellent in their own right, I occasionally tend to feel hesitant about putting them on on a given day.  With Ride the Lightning, this is not the case.  Everything about this album is so amazing, from the frenetic riffage from \\"Creeping Death\\" to the epic, Uli Roth/Randy Rhoads-ish soloing on \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" to the incredible harmonized bridge right before the last solo section on \\"Fade to Black.\\"  Whenever I hear that part I turn up the volume and tell everyone else in the room to shut up so they can revel in the glory that is the interplay between guitars.  With no other Metallica album can I do that.  The other two ballads, \\"One\\" and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\", from the other two albums, while exceptional, for me, don't encapsulate the beauty of life as well as \\"Fade to Black\\" does.  I don't know if it's just me, but I just feel incredible when I hear that song and Ifeel good about life.  Well, I'm babbling now, but other high points are \\"For whom the Bell Tolls\\" and the instrumentation on \\"Call of Ktulu\\".  That song truly displays the instrumentational prowess of Metallica, and the ability of conceiving one album of RTL's scope, let alone two others, is something reserved for a select few.  <br />As one had said earlier, this album is one that can be appreciated by all music lovers, not just Heavy Metal fans.  Buy Ride the Lightning to experience something of immense power and beauty.<br />Some other albums to consider, for those who are just getting into underground 80s metal, are \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Peace sells...but who's buying\\" by Megadeth, \\"Hell Awaits\\"/\\"Reign in Blood\\"/\\"South of Heaven\\" by Slayer, \\"The Legacy\\" by Testament, or  Sepultura's first album.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I saw this movie after it was recommended that if I enjoyed Mulholland Drive I would enjoy this one. I found this movie to be even more disturbing than Mulholland Drive, and just as difficult to figure out after the film had ended. At times the movie also reminded me of &quot;American Beauty&quot; with its portrait of suburban dysfunctional family life. I thoght Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance but I found his character to be somewhat creepy as well of course as the circumstances and visions that he experiences. I thought his therapist was not so competent and I was surprised he didnt get as angry with her as he did with the other fanatical adults that he encountered. The movie was just a little too intense for me at times and was often painful to watch. The ending I found totally baffling as well as totally unexpected, but I guess if I watch it again I might possibly figure it out. In short if you want to watch a movie that will induce in you the urge to take tranquilizing medication, I recommend this movie.
B000068FY0|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS FANTASTIC.  IT'S ACTUALLY THE 2ND SUPERTRAMP I PURCHASED BUT IT IS MY FAVORITE(I ACTUALLY HAVE EVERY STUDIO RELEASED ALBUM OF SUPERTRAMP).  I REALLY LOVE &quot;HIDE IN YOUR SHELL&quot;(MY FAVORITE SUPERTRAMP SONG).  I'VE LISTENED TO THIS CLASSIC SONG 10 TIMES IN A ROW IN ONE SITTING.  IT'S A SONG THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH.  I ALSO REALLY LIKE SCHOOL, RUDY, DREAMER &amp; ASYLUM.  THEY TEND TO BRING OUT YOUR EMOTIONS.  <br />RICK DAVIES &amp; RODGER HODGSON WERE QUITE A DUO.  PLEASE DO YOUR FANS A FAVOR &amp; TOUR AGAIN.  DO ME A FAVOR &amp; STOP IN KC.<br />THANKS VERY MUCH!<br />TOM B
B00000634J|5.0|I'm 15, and was raised on The Beatles, but I only got interested in John lennon's solo work a few months agp. The man was a musical genuis. That's NOT a lie at all! The best songs are &quot;Just Like Starting Over&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; &quot;Imagine&quot; &quot;Happy XMas&quot; and &quot;Stand By me&quot;.<br />I miss John. I wasn't even alive when he was tragically murdered, but I'm sure he could've saved the music industry from the tasteless junk it has begun if he were still alive!<br />And I'll admit it . . . the first few times I heard &quot;Imagine&quot;, I cried. It WAS a sincere statement. It wasn't his fault he was a rich man, he worked hard for it. Ever heard of the kind of dumps The Beatles had to play in before their big break?<br />Love you, John! You're one of the best!
0684833395|3.0|Catch-22 tells the tortuous story of Yossarian, a WW2 bombardier, who starts to lose (or regain) his sanity after a member of his crew is killed during a bombing mission.  As Yossarian loses more of his friends to enemy fire, bizarre accidents and strange twists of fate, the storyline becomes ever more convoluted and the characters ever more bizarre.<br />At its heart, this book is about how soldiers handle war. How they justify their actions and how they live with the constant threat of death or injury. Heller illustrates the confusion and senselessness of war by using bizarre events and crooked logic. The book is filled with black humor and quickly moves from one outlandish event to the next.<br />In my opinion, this book has two major weaknesses. The first, is one of the hallmarks of this book: Heller builds his sentences to suggest an idea, only to immediately contradict himself. I found this to be very amusing for the first 100 pages or so, but this style simply became tedious afterwards. The second problem is the book's non-chronological plot. Heller keeps skipping back and forth in time and this makes the book hard to read and the plot difficult to follow.<br />I found the book's real strength to be in its amazing and phenomenally well developed characters. Yossarian, Doc. Daneeka, Orr, Major Major and many more, are all extraordinarily alive and yet fundamentally flawed. <br />Did I enjoy this book? Yes. All in all, this is a book worth reading, but don't expect an easy read.
B00006LJ72|3.0|While I have been a longtime Enya fan (since 1992), I have the same sentiments as a few others concerning this boxed set.  The music is very good and all, but...why can't there be anything really new/obscure?  Every few years when she releases a new album, her record label \\"thoughtfully\\" decides to re-package the majority of her songs from all the albums into a new set.  But they include very little new material.  This is not unlike the trend during the '70s after The Beatles broke up.  Their label re-packaged all their songs into a bunch of different \\"greatest hits\\" albums.  All those songs were readily available on their respective albums, and for the most part, there was nothing new to be found each time.  The same goes with this Enya set (and her previous ones as well).<br />There are a LOT of great non-album tracks out there which really need to be included here.  Many of these tracks are easily obtainable on import CD-singles at a rather hefty price.  Sometimes you have to fork over around $10 or more just for one or two new songs (and that can add up very quickly over time!).  Also, another major issue that the U.S. distributor almost always short changes the consumer!  They want to milk out as much as they can out of popular artists just so you buy more product.  Why, for instance, does the Japanese version of the same albums contain extra tracks, while the U.S. doesn't?<br />If you're a member of Columbia House's CD club and have the need for this Enya set, buy it from them.  It's usually listed as 40% off the retail price.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the San Francisco pre-Broadway production and loved it. I couldn't wait for the cast album to be released. It's a big splashy musical with great songs and performances. If your a fan of either of the lead females, you will not be disappointed.
B00006SFBD|5.0|What can I say? This is typical Opeth style. Brutal Riffs, amazing vocals, fantastic instumental work, jaw dropping melodies, the list goes on... Opeth have all you could want from a death metal band. This particular album is an absolute joy to listen too. Each and every song has been carefully crafted to create one of the finest Opeth releases to date. All previous releases are also amazing, but this particular CD stands out from the rest. It may be the fact that this CD is considered the heaviest they have produced so far. If you haven't heard Opeth before, and you are looking to buy one of their albums, then the best one to start off with would be 'My Arms Your Hearse'. To really appreciate what Opeth are about requires a few listens. Many newcomers to Opeth are put off by their style, by saying the songs are too long etc. <BR>Upon many listens, these assumptions quickly fade and you start to really apreciate their music. <BR>If you are an Opeth fan like myself, then this CD is a must have in your collection. I am lucky enough to have every album they have released, a total of 7. I have been looking for the first two CD's 'Orchid' and 'Morningrise' for a very long time, and I finally have them...
B00003CXA3|3.0|If you like a gritty, non-stop action movie, you will love what you see here.  Popeye, the psycho cop who cares about nothing except getting his prey, was a defining role for Hackman.  The car chase scene ranks as one of the best ever. NYC looks like a filthy mess ( which it was, and still is ), and adds to the effect of the film.  Great action movie!!
0312263120|5.0|Since I wasn't able to sleep on my red-eye flight to Orlando, I was able to start (and finish) Digital Fortress by Dan Brown.  A very enjoyable read, especially if you're into technology security and encryption.  The storyline revolves around the National Security Agency (NSA) and their activities surrounding the monitoring of communication.  They are able to break any encryption with the aid of a massive secret computer, and life is good.  But when a code appears that can not be broken, all hell breaks loose.  The author, a former employee of the NSA, is about to release the code to the highest bidder.  The NSA has to stop this from happening so that they will not be locked out of all encrypted data.  When the employee is murdered, it gets impossible to tell who is selling out who.<br />Great pacing, believable storyline, and a very good read.  If you want a nice techno-escape, this would be a great choice.
B0000E64TR|5.0|Remember when pop stars had balls?  When they took genuine musical \\"risks\\", tried to expand their own style and grow their fan base AND create interesting and challenging work?<BR>Elton John, nearing his apogee with two consecutive number one debuts on the horizon (back when it meant something), made a double album that opened with a long instrumental called \\"Funeral For A Friend\\".<BR>Are you serious? Label suits nowadays would have dropped a brick.<BR>Funny thing is that it worked, segueing into a more traditional pop rocker, \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\".<BR>There are epic ballads, including the immortal \\"Candle In The Wind\\" and the title song.<BR>There are breakneck rockers, like \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\". That one was even covered by The Who...<BR>There are touches of reggae, 50's rock, Tin Pan Alley...all from a little guy with funny glasses who plays the piano.<BR>This is a great example of an artist with great faith in his audience. Several decades later,  with all you already know about Elton John, it may be hard to place in proper context. <BR>What if Nick Lachey produced something like \\"Born To Run\\"?<BR>OK. Maybe I went too far.<BR>Nevertheless, it's an impressive accomplishment. The remastering is very well done, as this is, like, the fourth go round now...
B00000JCB2|5.0|Keeping with my weirdness of reviewing older records, Limp Bizkit happens to be the band for me at the moment. Dunno why, but Results May Vary has shown me a new side of Limp Bizkit that is so brilliant, it had to make me listen to my older Limp CD's just to make sure this was the same Limp. And of course, one of those CD's was Significant Other. SO... I'm gonna tell you why Significant Other is a cracker of a CD.<br />1. Intro - They're intros... nothing special, but this one is at least better than the CSATHDFW one. 6/10<BR>2. Just Like This - Pretty good opening song. Not the best, but definately not the worst. 8/10<BR>3. Nookie - Everyone knows this classic. Still good despite it being older Bizkit. 9/10<BR>4. Break Stuff - Heavy, heavy song. Words can't describe what Fred was going through when he wrote this mother. 9/10<BR>5. Re-Arranged - My favourite song off the album. Just sticks with me with the haunting chorus and guitar. 10/10<BR>6. I'm Broke - Another fave, due to the fact that it works so well. Rapid, rhythmic and relentless. The three R's. A beast of a song. 10/10<BR>7. Nobody Like You - This one's got Jonathon Davis on it, and it's pretty good. He manages to outshine Fred in this one. 9/10<BR>8. Don't Go Off Wandering - I always imagined a video for this song being played in a haunted house, because that's what the music is. Haunting. Not in the bad way though... This song is damn good. 10/10<BR>9. 9 Teen 90 Nine - Damn good song with a damn good chorus. Yeah, yeah... I know it's 2 Thousand 3, but 9 Teen 90 Nine still stands out as a classic song. 10/10<BR>10. N 2 Gether Now - When you get Method Man on a track, it can only mean it's gonna be a freakin' good song. This is no exception. Harps? Get out! 10/10<BR>11. Trust? - This is heavy. Oh, it's a good song too. Chorus is iffy, and Fred churns out an angry voice, but for a song like this, who cares? 9/10<BR>12. No Sex - Ah, sex is a weird subject to sing about in a song, but Fred pulls it off withlittle to no effort at all. Damn good song, but don't ask if it's suitable to make out to, cause I really don't know what preferences you have. 10/10<BR>13. Show Me What You Got - Gives shoutouts to everyone who helped with the album, from the fans to the guest singers, to cities across the USA. How nice. Oh, and the song is good too. 10/10<BR>14. A Lesson Learned - I really don't listen to this song too often to be honest, cause it just doesn't connect. 4/10<BR>15. Outro - Scary as all hell. That's all I can say. 5/10<br />So basically you've got a good Limp Bizkit album on your hands here. Buy it if you haven't and let the good times roll!
B00005JMTN|4.0|BIG FISH seems like a big departure from the genre of films that Tim Burton directs. BIG FISH is refreshing if not just a little strange. However, it does not fail to entertain and it does keep you hooked. It is a great set of slices of one man's life and depending on how much truth you think they contain comes the pay-off.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park are proving to be one of the greatest bands ever. Their songs just keep getting better and better, and the new album Meteora is a killer. Here's the rundown.<br />1. Foreword - Leads into Don't Stay and goes for about 6 seconds, so not much to comment on, folks. 5/10<BR>2. Don't Stay - The first song, and a terrific opener. Chester can change his tone with little to no effort, which makes this a powerful song. 9/10<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - The first single, and a brilliant song. Mike and Chester let this song flow so smoothly that you really can't help but be mesmerized by the overall sound. 10/10<BR>4. Lying From You - This is a killer song. Chester screams, Mike raps through the whole ordeal, and yet, they manage to produce some of the finest music on the album... How do they do it? 10/10<BR>5. Hit The Floor - Not a fave... but still pretty good. The music just doesn't cut it for me. 8/10<BR>6. Easier To Run - Yep, this is my fave song on the album. May be slower, but it sounds a hell of a lot sweeter. Mike's supersmooth voice and Chester's supersoft lyrics make this a winner. 10/10<BR>7. Faint - Now we're talking. Second single and another fave, basically cause the chorus is so commanding. Chester attracts every last amount of attention from you and releases it into an explosive chorus. 10/10<BR>8. Figure.09 - Yay, another good song! Has to be Mike's best rapping on the album. 10/10<BR>9. Breaking The Habit - Wins the award for being the &quot;Most Different Song&quot; on the album. Chester sounds a lot softer on this one, but it still manages to be an incredible track. 9/10<BR>10. From The Inside - The new single. And it's a hell of a ride. When it's done, you won't be able to get over it. I love it. 10/10<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - My least fave song on the album. Mike's rapping is more X-Ecutioners for me, and even though I like the X-Ecutioners, I'm not the biggest fan of the subject matter. Fitting title though... I'm not listening. 5/10<BR>12. Session - Techno beats that run for over two minutes. I'm not all into this sorta stuff, but it's pretty good. 6/10<BR>13. Numb - Final song, third single. This builds up for the best finish to an extraordinary album. Sheer brilliance. 10/10<br />So in conclusion, Linkin Park have outshined yet again. Don't Stay... it's Easier To Run to a store to get this album. Get it now if you don't have it.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Ridley Scott is -to me- the best film director still working in America. He made another masterpiece, this time on an episode of warfare, after having filmed other genres like science-fiction: Blade Runner, Alien, historical: Gladiator, The Duelists or the road movie: Thelma and Louis. This action movie can stand at the same level as any of his previous.<br />The pacing, the photography, the script, everything shows that Mr Scott masters the technique and has a talent for storytelling and images like only an artist has.<br />Ridley Scott rocks again.<br />Bravo maestro!
B00004XOWM|5.0|Thought I'd share my thoughts on an older Limp Bizkit CD, cause I wanna share my thoughts. Everyone seems to hate the new Limp album, even though they never heard of them. Weak. All I can say about them. Anyway, I'm gonna share some thoughts on Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavoured Water.<br />1. Intro - Pretty weird intro. Sorta like an alien type of communication thing. 5/10<BR>2. Hot Dog - Says the &quot;F&quot; word around 50 times in this song... still, it's a heavy as hell song and one that gets you going. 9/10<BR>3. My Generation - Not a bad song. Still keeping in with the heavy genre of the band, but not a fave. 7/10<BR>4. Full Nelson - A fighting song. Again, not a fave but good for what it's worth. 7/10<BR>5. My Way - Now this is more like it! A damn good song with catchy music and the film clip just cracks me up each time. Heh heh heh... cavemen... 10/10<BR>6. Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle) - Don't let the name confuse you, this is the default Rollin' and in my opinion the best. I also like the UAV version, but this one is just better. 10/10<BR>7. Livin' It Up - A damn good song. First time I heard it, I couldn't stop playing it. Now I'm basically over it, but it remains one of my faves. 9/10<BR>8. The One - Hands down, best song on the album. Excuse it for being slow and soft, this just happens to be LB at its best. The final chorus just builds up the crescendo for the grand finale and leaves you hanging. 10/10<BR>9. Getcha Groove On - This is what you get if you crossed LB, Xzibit and for some reason &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; church organ music... I dunno... A great rap song, and Xzibit just annihilates on this track. 10/10<BR>10. Take A Look Around - Mission: Impossible, anyone? Yep, the theme track is a cracker. I doubt any band could produce a Mission: Impossible theme song to this calibre. 10/10<BR>11. It'll Be OK - A slower, more depressing song, but the guitar in this track is brilliant. 10/10<BR>12. Boiler - Damnitt, this song is sweet. Heavy, slow, loud... yeah, all you'd want in a Limp Bizkit song. 10/10<BR>13. Hold On - Oh what a cracker of a song. Would've outshined The One, had I have been a sucker for kick-ass music. The music is bleak and the lyrics are something of great beauty. 10/10<BR>14. Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle) - Now this is a song. Ok, so it's Rollin' all over again, but throw Method Man, Redman and DMX into the works and you've got something going on here. Not as good as the Air Raid Vehicle, but still a joy to hear DMX's barking and the sly lyrics of Method Man. 10/10<BR>15. Outro - Like Intro, very weird. All I can say about it really... and there's some stuff after that which makes it weirder... like some guy laughing continuously for 2 minutes. 5/10<br />So in conclusion, a worthy album if you like Limp Bizkit. If you're after a heavy album, I recommend this, or Significant Other. If you're after music, get Results May Vary.
6304508611|5.0|I've recently seen the later TV film incarnation of Carrie.It doesn't compare to this 1976 theatrical adaptation.All actors in this film are outstanding.Including Betty Buckley as the girls Phys Ed coach Miss Collins.A perfect horror flick for it's time.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's 'The DaVinci Code' has been atop the bestseller list for 40 some weeks.  The 'fiction' list.  And the surest way to reach the top of the bestseller lists is to write for the lowest common denominator (in the sports world read: NASCAR) which in this case means - the mystery hound.  The DaVinci Code's appeal is that it is Grisham, Turow, or even JK Rowling, yet  with a religious twist.  Every chapter ends with a pointed gun.  Come to think of it, isn't this how Frank and Joe Hardy move through life?  Solve one riddle, and up pops another.  Everything is life-threatening, world-ending, but avoided by sheer pluck of the hero and heroine.  Turn the page, please.<br />The hook is set on the frontispiece, \\"Fact:\\"  We're in for a duel between the Priory of Sion - a secret society founded in medieval Europe (presumably still alive even in suburban Long Island according to the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut' movie), and the countervailing forces of Opus Dei, a devout Catholic sect to whom the Vatican is beholden.  Immediately, on page one, a murder takes place under the watchful eyes of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre.  So, right away we know we are going to learn more about art and architecture in the next 450 pages than we do about the columns of Mississippi courthouses in a John Grisham  novel.<br />The plot is all go-go, and we're off quickly on a goosechase through Europe, ('mais Versailles, ce n'est pas nord-ouest du Paris, je pense, Monsieur Brun') replete with art, history, symbology and architectural lessons that qualify readers for a minor in liberal arts by book's end.  Papal conspiracies, self-flagilating monks, the obligatory sex ceremonies, hidden gospels, unbreakable ciphers...all the trappings of a first-rate page turner.<br />You have to read it, just to be current, and to fend off all the loonies on either side who scream 'Heresey!' or 'Truth!'  I borrowed my copy from the library, but getting your paperback investment sandy at the beach this summer will be well worth it.ill be well worth it.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album has been broken down and parsed before, so I will say what you still need to know. This is maybe the most amazing album of all time. When I listen to it, I get that feeling in my heart that I get when I see the Grand Canyon, or a detonating nuclear bomb--sheer awe. The great album feeling, I call it. <BR>This is just one of those albums, like that first real rock and roll album you got when you were a budding adolescent.<BR>Not only is the album stupifying, it is intimidating. All of the tracks have a way of sounding harmless to the untrained ear, but if you let them, they will sound as angry as any recording, before or since. White Light/White Heat is a real trip.

B00007M5CO|3.0|Hola. I thought I would let you know you that although BF made its way through the corporate hallways into a place where we all can see it (Grammy blah blah) thanks to Santaolalla who has indeed produced many of the best &quot;latin&quot; albums (and I can't help saying &quot;latin music&quot; is quite a stupid, blurring label but oh well...), BF is actually composed mainly of Uruguayan musicians that he met while producing their records.<br />Most important are Ex-hip-hoppers-turned-DJs Campo(donico) from Peyote Asesino and Luciano Supervielle from Platano Macho (by the way, they were quite ahead of the rap-hiphop-metal wave with their seminal bands, together with a number of other &quot;latin music&quot; bands back in the days). They perform the live DJ acts while Santaolalla seems to deal mainly with the corporate/marketing side.<br />The album has a song written by Jorge Drexler too (campo produced his records adding a fitting, subtle electronica background to his modern version of regional music like candombe, regional folk, etc. - check that out as a side dish if you can) The song is quite good and is sung by Adriana Varela, a great Argie singer with a great raspy voice. Check her solo albums too. That's real tango, no electronica there. <br />Santaolalla is actually quite useless onstage, but somehow he always seems to be there when things happen musically in these latitudes (Vela Puerca, Cafe Tacuba, Peyote Asesino, Divididos, etc.) so I give him credit.<br />As for the record itself, I agree with the criticism above although I do own it and like it. I got it stage-side after seeing them play without an idea of what I was going to see.<br />The album is a first, more or less basic exploration of electronica for these people and yes, I felt it didn't live up to my expectations when it comes to having the spirit and strenght of real tango as we know it here (tango is as much from Montevideo as it is from BsAs). The breaking-up of too-short tango samples to match the underlying non-tango beats leave a sweetener kind of aftertaste in your mouth. Not quite the natural, smooth blending one would expect (as was the case with the countless bossa/electronica experiences around).<br />Actually, the record's best moment is near the end, in a song where suddenly all the electronica stops to leave a solo bandoneon for some seconds. That works a treat and you find yourself waiting for it to happen again. But hey, that's just tango! Just a sample from an old tango record! So that's what I mean, the tango is enhanced by the contrast of the sudden change, and maybe we would not have liked the rest of the original tango song, granted, but still, it feels like much much more can be done. That's not entirely bad, being this one of the two first records in the genre. Hooking but not entirely satisfactory, leaves you wanting for more to come.<br />I also feel the other one, Gotan Project has less quality, a certain amateurish feeling, particularly in the vocal and lyrics department, wich you might not perceive if you are not familiar with the way we speak in the Rio de la Plata (Montevideo - Buenos Aires area, tango central). The girl doesn't sound like she's a tango singer. Must be the phrasing, I don't know. Maybe she is a tango person but still feels a bit lost in electronica. Something's missing to me anyway.<br />But hey, we are talking about just 2 records, so get both and as others said here, let's wait for this movement to get a little bit more solid. You can count on many of these records poping up in the area in the near future. It always works like that down here. The popcorn syndrome.<br />My 3 stars are actually 3.6 or something like that. Not 4, but just to leave room for that very special album yet to come. <br />Maybe it would be good to drop Santaolalla and get the french electronica guy behind Gotan working with the real tangueros from BF and Campo and Supervielle's rithm and songwriting instincts. That would be a good one.<br />Anyway, eso es todo. Enjoy it.

0385504209|2.0|This review will be unfortunately a bit longer than I want it to be, as I care to spend little time writing about a book I consider to be a second rate, cheap, dimestore thriller.  I picked up this book to see what all the hoopla was about, but much to my disappointment, it was what I consider the \\"Big Mac\\" of books:  tastes good, but no nutritional value.<br />Da Vinci code is a formulaic franchise (yes, I deliberately use that word) that reads like a Spielberg movie.  Dan Brown is a hybrid of all the other popular mainstream thriller authors out there that are currently making bazillions of dollars on the rights of their novels being sold for silver screen production. (I'm looking at you, Chrichton, and you, Grisham)  But I believe Mr. Brown, has done himself a service in that he was able to save himself some extra cash when the inevitable transfer from book-to-movie comes around.  He will not have to hire any scriptwriters, because the book already reads like a movie script.  No changes necessary.<br />For those of you who understand where I am coming from, yet steadfastly refuse to be deterred from reading the book, the only positive critique I can give is this; it *is* a page turner.  But, then again, is that really a positive comment?  If that were the case, Danielle Steel or Judith Kranz would be considered the literary geniuses of our time.  Heck, for that matter, so would Penthouse Forum.<br />Another element that strikes a discord with me is how good Mr. Brown is at in blending fact with fiction.  I understand that common practice and Brown is certainly not the first to interweave these two elements to create a plausible synopsis, but the difference here is that it seems to be undermining people's faith in religion and that Christianity is one big conspiracy.  I won't go into detail about the fabrications that Dan Brown has made in the book, lest I give the story away, but rest assured there are plenty of websites and articles out there that debunk the authors many presumptions.  This is a work of fiction and people need to keep that in mind.  In conclusion, the only conspiracy here is the marketing one.authors many presumptions.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This album managed to drop all the shortcomings of their previous album, such as the cheesy 80's nuances.  The singer has refined his vocal style quite a bit since 7th Trumpet, sounding more aggressive and less boyish. <br />Additionally, this album is more listenable all the way through, while I struggle to get through all of 7th trumpet.<br />I think these guys are headed in the right direction.<br />My highlights: Chapter Four (possibly their best song in my opinion), Second Heartbeat (the first song I heard, from a compilation, before I was a little let down by their last album), and Desecration Through Reverence.  Many other great ones as well; those just come immediately to mind.
B00008OM7U|5.0|Everyone seems to think this is the worst LORDS cd but I disagree. Although there is very little continuity between the song styles, I think this was a very brave album for the band.<BR>If you enjoy the recent never to be officially released LORDS CD &quot;Hang On&quot; you will not like &quot;Sacred&quot; at all. Gone are Treguna's brilliant bass lines, Nicks thumping surf drums, and Brian's stones style. All of which are the glue for SACRED.<BR>This other reviewer must be Steven Marque because he keeps on trying to use his name to compare and yet has absolutely nothing in common with Stiv's talent.  Shame on YOu Steven Marque. That is really pathetic and so is your &quot;talent&quot;
B0000DD7LB|5.0|THIS HAS TO BE THE BRITNEY ALBUM OF HER CARRER. SHE FINALLY LOSES HER BUBBLE GUM POP IMAGE AND RELEASES SOME REAL MUSIC. THIS ALBUM JUMPS FROM GENRE TO GENRE.

THIS SONG WILL MAKE HIP HOP DJS PLAY THIS SONG ON REPEAT IN CLUBS .10/10<br />3. SHOWDOWN - THIS SONG TOOK ME A WHILE TO GET USED TO. BUT NOW I REALLY LIKE IT. THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POPIEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. THIS SONG CONTAINS BRITNEY WHISPERING \\"I DON'T WANT TO BE A TEASE. WOULD YOU UNDO MY ZIPPER PLZ\\". BLOODSHY & AVANT DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS SONG, MAKING IT SOUND UNIQUE. 9/10<br />4. BREATHE ON ME - EVEN THOUGH I HAVE GIVEN A FEW SONGS FROM THE ALBUM A 10/10 THIS HAS TO BE MY ALL TIME FAV ON THE ALBUM. THIS SONG IS VERY CLUB SAVVY SOUNDING VERY EUROPEAN. IF THIS SONG WOULD BE RELEASED IT WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO #1 IN EUROPE AND STAY THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THIS SONG WILL BE LOVED BY DANCE DJS. 10/10<br />5. EARLY MORNIN - THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE MOST SENSUAL TRACKS ON THE SONGS. WITHIN THE FIRST 5 SECONDS OF THIS SONG YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY TELL IT IS MOBY PRODUCED. 8/10<br />6. TOXIC - THE SECOND SINGLE FROM THE ALBUM. PRODUCED BY BLOODSHY & AVANT. THIS IS A VERY UP-TEMPO SONG AND HAS A SPY THEME TO IT. ANOTHER OF ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVS 10/10<br />7. OUTRAGEOUS - A TYPCIALLY R. KELLY PRODUCED SONG. SINCE I AM A BIG FAN OF R.KELLY I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG. THE R&B BEATS REALLY SUIT BRITNEY. 10/10<br />8. TOUCH OF MY HAND - PROBABLY THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND SENSUAL SONG ONTHE ALBUM. THIS SONG IS AN ODE TO MASTERBATION. THIS AGAIN IS VERY CLUB SAVVY AND ITS VIOLIN BEATS MAKE YOU VERY SEXY. AGAIN I GIVE THIS SONG A 10/10. I LOVE IT<br />9. THE HOOK-UP - THIS REDZONE PRODUCED SONG IS PRETTY GOOD. IT SOUNDS VERY REGAEE. ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T ONE OF MY FAVS I STILL LIKE IT 7/10<br />10. SHADOW - MY FAVOURITE BALLAD ON THE ALBUM. BRITNEY'S VOCALS REALLY STAND OUT ON THIS TRACK. IT IS VERY REMENISCANT TO AVRIL'S I'M WITH YOU. 9/10<br />11. BRAVE NEW GIRL - HAS TO BE THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM. AND PERHAPS ONE OF BRITNEY'S WORST SONGS OF ALL TIME. THIS SONG IS VERY STUPID AND CONSISTS OF BRITNEY RAPPING. I WOULD GIVE THIS SONG A 0.5/10. I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT<br />12. EVERYTIME - THE SECOND BALLAD ON THE ALBUM. I PERSONALLY REALLY LOVE THE LYRICS TO THIS SONG BUT I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE WAY IT WAS RECORDED. IT WAS RECORDED VERY LOW. I FIRSTLY HEARD THIS SONG ON SNL WHEN SHE SANG IT LIVE AND THOUGHT IT SOUNDED MUCH BETTER THERE. ALTHOUGH I STILL LIKE THIS SONG BUT NOT ONE OF MY FAVS CAUSE IM NOT A REALLY BIG FAN OF BALLADS. 7/10<br />13. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (REMIX) - I REALLY LIKE THE REMIX TO THIS TRACK. IT HAS AN INDIAN BEAT AND IS REMIXED INTO THE SONG VERY WELL. ONE OF BRITNEY'S BEST REMIXES. 10/10<br />14. THE ANSWER (BONUS TRACK) - I THINK THIS SONG ISN'T BAD. ALTHOUGH I EXPECTED MORE FROM A SONG PRODUCED BY P.DIDDY AND BRITNEY. THIS SONG IS MID-TEMPO AND BRITNEY'S VOICE IS VERY LOW REGISTER. 7/10<br />15. DON'T HANG UP - THE SECOND BONUS TRACK ON THE ALBUM. THIS SONG IS ABOUT PHONE-SEX. I DON'T REALLY LIKE THIS SONG. I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE WORST SONGS ON THE ALBUM. AGAIN IT IS PRODUCED BY BRIAN & JOSH THE SAME PEOPLE WHO PRODUCED BRAVE NEW GIRL. .5/10<br />ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND I THINK IT IS THE BEST ALBUM OF 2003 AND SO FAR 2004. ALL IN ALL I CONGRATULATE BRITNEY FOR RELEASING THIS STUNNING ALBUM.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|As Mike (Portnoy) already said, this is the metal CD they always wanted to make. And it shows. OK, it's different then SFAM but it really rocks. The most amazing thing about DT is however their live performance. Man, I saw them for the fifth time now and again it's amazing how good they are alive. An evening with is really THE THING.<BR>Anyway, about Train of Thought: just listen to it over and over again. It becomes better everytime.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll only say this quickly since it's already been said over and over again in these reviews:  this series has great characters and crackling-good stories and for those reasons alone are worth your time and money.  But I also want to emphasize the fact that these shows have some of the most amazing and ambitious action scenes in recent memory, and that includes comparisons to stuff you pay to see in the movies.  Joss Whedon doesn't settle for clean space battles with a few laser effects.  No, we get dramatic and extended chase scenes in the atmosphere of planets, with the terrain and clouds flying by; characters climbing around on the outside of the ship (again, while the ship is in the atmosphere with the wind whipping our heroes about), and all manner of cityscapes, spaceports, and landing pads.  Details, action, and effects certainly aren't the most important elements of a good science fiction show (great characters and great stories are), but one should be aware that this show delivers the important things AND isn't stingy with the thrills, effects, and &quot;wow&quot; factor.  Buy this now.
B00005QDW1|4.0|i was (am?) a no doubt fan; i've got all their previous albums, and i was of course a little wary when i got this one last christmas.  but after giving it a few listens, it grew on me, and perhaps that's what this album is meant to do: work its way into your favor.  (thankfully, i never really listen to the radio or watch MTV, so i wasn't already sick and tired of it.)<BR>so here's what i think: <BR>&quot;hella good&quot; and &quot;hey baby&quot; are good dance songs though devoid of substance.  <BR>&quot;making out&quot; displays one of my least favorite gwen stefani personalities in a mediocre electro-pop song.  <BR>&quot;underneath it all&quot; is a wonderful show of no doubt's reggae leanings, pulled off mainly because it's not a complete switch of genres (it still sounds like them, in other words).  <BR>i personally don't find &quot;detective&quot; very satisfying- is it because of the blatant paranoia?<BR>&quot;don't let me down&quot; is No Doubt New Wave taken to the extreme, and for that reason could have almost found a better place on return of saturn.  but it sure is catchy.<BR>i quite enjoy &quot;start the fire&quot;.  it has one of the best beats on this album and a nice tune (lyrics aren't bad either).<BR>&quot;running&quot; begins with something reminiscent of game boy music and is so pretty it borders on cutesy.<BR>don't like &quot;in my head&quot;.<BR>&quot;platinum blonde life&quot; is another dive into cars-y new wave.  and is she mocking herself here?<BR>next is the dreadfully ill-advised collaboration with prince, &quot;waiting room&quot;.  decidedly the worst track on this album.<BR>the album ends with the lovely title track, on which uncertain love achieves melancholy perfection.<BR>all in all, the best songs are the sweet and slow ones.  and in response to the editorial review: the music certainly isn't the &quot;star&quot; of rock steady, but finally takes a willing backseat and holds everything (including itself) together.  the album is painstakingly produced, a variety of little keyboard riffs and stealthy guitar scratches cohering to make a great backdrop.  so who's the star- gwen stefani or the mood of the album?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|so fox, you decided to put a new show in the &quot;death&quot; timeslot? a sci-fi show that would always do better earlier in the week? a show by the writing (directing, producing... and so forth and so on) genius joss whedon? and then you cancel it. i just want to know how bad you guys are feeling right now? i mean really? this is the 550th five star review for a show that you decided was unworthy of your time. man you must be feeling really stupid right now.<BR>bye<BR>oh. and the extras make this the best dvd (set or single) that i have in my large collection. <BR>joss-- keep juggling those balls, all will workout. stay shiny
B00006L3S3|5.0|I just bought this Cd today, and man, its fantastic!!! Once and for all, to banish those who consider this a half-baked effort-its fantastic. The title track leads the way, but songs like &quot;Bring on the Lucie (Freda People)&quot;, &quot;Meat City&quot;, &quot;Only People&quot; etc etc are just marvellous tracks from a man I consider the most gifted Beatle. But John here has left the Beatles far behind, and its a very satisfying, very timeless, album. I love it++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B00000DC4A|3.0|I miss Bryan's 80s works, where you could never see him with out his electric guitar in hand, pounding out simple but effective songs much to my delight..,well he still has his guitar, its here on the cover of the album, but unfortunately, that's where it stays.<br />There are some fantastic mood music songs on here. \\"C'mon C'mon C'mon\\" has a great relaxing vibe to it, that you may hear playing in the background of a cozy room on a bleak day or rain-soaked night. It's perfect. \\"Fearless\\" is a nice uptempo ballad about cheating, its a nice song though and it works well. \\"How Do you Feel Tonight\\" gets things going pretty good but is a little lacking compared to the aforementioned tracks, still a nice song.<br />A duet with a Spice Girl? Uhhh, I don't know how smart that was, its a good song (\\"When You're Gone\\") but I guess ol Bryan was just trying to capitalize on the mainstream power, the THEN power, of the Spice Girls..either way, it too, is a decent song.<br />But towards the end of the album, things just fall apart and I'm sorry to say that there is nothing special on the album after \\"Inside Out\\" which is the last decent track, mixing a nice and steady rhythm with a good beat for some good down-tuned enjoyment. I guess you may consider it a ballad, but to me it isn't quite because it has too much of an upbeat feel for it...might have even sounded better had it been done on a simple acoustic guitar. <br />For the most part this album has a very soft adult-comtemporary feel to it a la Sting or Rod Stewart, and he has worked with these individuals in the past. When I first heard this album I loved most of these songs but as the year's have gone by (Well, since 2001 when I first got it) I enjoy it a little less and less. The tracks above that I mentioned are always going to be classics to me, but I used to find much more to like about this album...<br />Stick To Your Guns Bryan. Pull out the guitar and let us hear you rock! 6/13
B00009Y3L4|4.0|I would like to begin by saying that this is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an engaging story of genuine human emotion and the need for fulfillment against the grain of common society.  This is a very good movie.  But I must admit that I have mixed feelings about this film.  The story following the lives of an American expatriot cabaret singer and an expatriot English tutor in their struggles with love greed and survival in Weimer Republic Germany is honest and entertaining and the political subplot (I should really call it the major underlying theme) of the rise of Nazism and the dehumanization of Germany is thought provoking and sometimes tragic.  The scene in which the youth gets up and sings the rousing patriotic song only to have the camera role back and disclose to the audience that he is a Hitler youth is almost frightening in the sharp change of emotions it ellicits from the viewer.  The Cabaret song sequences serve to highlight certain themes and link the story together quite nicely.  The ending is absolutely brilliant.  And yet, with all these wonderful attributes I still can't decide whther or not I like this movie, and I can't explain why.  I guess the only way to find out what you will think is to see it for yourself.  I will say it's one of those movies that stays with you.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spiderman, Tobey Maguire, Willem DaFoe and Kirsten Dunst (Quite the hottie I must say : ) !) Well... here we go again an awesome comic book hero turned into a movie. In any other case this movie would suck b***s. But this movie is rather good. A rather unique phenomena in the movie field. The end was rather STUPID. But the rest of the movie was fair, scratch that awesome. Well I think that it deserved all the credit that it got for being good. <br />Tobey Maguire is a geek that goes on a field trip that  turns out to change his life. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider, the next morning he wakes up as a buff dude. He goes to school and starts testing out his powers. Meanwhile his bestfriends father (Willem DaFoe) makes this super artificial weapon. He then turns insane and uses it to turn himself as the green goblin. He then turns himself infamous. You start seeing him doing this Gollum from LOTR type thing going on and it is quite creepy.<br />Well you know the rest, Spiderman and the Green Goblin face off in a big fight. It is pretty big and sweet, so watch this movie if you want to I recommend it greatly.
B00013PHGS|4.0|3.5 stars.  The delicate, atmospheric and ethereal soundscapes composed on \\"Moon Safari\\" possibly aren't meant to be matched, or perhaps Air are continuing on their chosen path of undefined music that both enchants the listener as well as putting one at relative ease.    Their themes are still evident - travel, loneliness, amongst others - and their continued usage of an array of studio enhancements and instrumentation make each piece another escape into a world we can hardly seem to find on our own, but it becomes all too familiar with their lending hand.  Bearing in mind that their English is far from perfect, their considerable amount of lyrics (in regards to they themselves) is all part of the act but sometimes distracting to their lush musical arrangements (which makes tracks such as \\"Mike Mills\\" - their documentary director - and \\"Alone In Kyoto\\" - also in \\"Lost In Translation\\") stand out even more.  Previous stellar lyrical guests were better merely for the sake that those voices (Beth Hirsch in particular) were in fact singers.    All in all this one is not as mystified or too far out of reach as \\"10,000 Hz Legend\\" was to some, but pales in comparison to their masterful debut or \\"Premiers\\" (although, it be better to try new ideas rather than repeat over previously traversed places).  This is Air.  There are no other musical acts such as this and for that, be grateful - pick it up.  *Bonus DVD nice added accompaniment.   Assistance from Nigel Godrich warmly welcomed.   See them live for an even odder experience.
B000000WJK|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. I am a big Spiritualized fan, and this album on first listen reminded me of them in a big way. It feels so dreamy and textured, and the layering of all the songs is what really reminded me of Spiritualized. This particular album spends most of its time either in my cars CD player, or in one of the slots of my home CD player. The first song  is my favorite, but all are excellent. Buy it, you wount be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has to go down as one of the best all time scifi series.  I have been a scifi fan for years.  I have seen every episode of all of the star treks and stargate sg1's.  If this series would have continued I think it would have definitely given sg1 a run for its money as the best scifi series ever.  This is one of the most unique scifi shows I have ever seen.  The mix of western and science fiction was a great combination.  The show and cast were well beyond their time with this show.  If you haven't seen it and you love scifi, buy it.  The dynamic of the cast and the special effects are top notch.  You won't be disappointed.
B000068PQ0|3.0|Look, I love the Flaming Lips. I've loved the Flaming Lips for the past 11 years. In fact, I'd say they've been my favorite band over this span.<br />And yes, Yoshimi is a solid album. Were it put together by another artist, I would laud it as quite an achievement. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars out of 5.<br />But compared to Transmissions from the Satellite Heart, Clouds Taste Metallic, and The Soft Bulletin, where does this rate? Easy -- right at the bottom. Ranking the other three would come down to mood and require some thought, but no matter my mood, this is easily the worst album of the four. Every single element of this album is weaker than those others. And if you're that much more fond of the softer approach that the Flaming Lips have taken in the last few years, then The Soft Bulletin is the album for you. That features softer melodies and similar sonic experimentation, but far better songs and a much more enticing sound.  <br />Here's what I think happened . . . every now and then, the world of music turns on its axis so as to drive an otherwise obscure or independent band into popularity. No matter what the Flaming Lips put out in 2002, it was going to become popular -- it was just their time. So, the Yoshimi craze began with all these people picking up the album and acting as though they'd stumbled upon something novel and wonderful. The same thing happened with Blur and &quot;Think Tank&quot; -- both &quot;Blur&quot; and &quot;13&quot; are easily better albums, but the sun wasn't shining on Damon Albarn when they were released. <br />But like Blur, the Flaming Lips had always been putting out better albums. It's just that no one in the American music press was paying them all that much attention before. <br />And that's why I don't know a single long-time Flaming Lips fan who considers this their best work. It just isn't, on any level, and it's really disappointing to me that so many people have latched onto it nonetheless. It's a major step backwards from The Soft Bulletin, which itself was a major change in direction from their prior work. Yoshimi isn't bad standing on its own, but it's not making me really look forward to the band's next work.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I bought this video on the spur of the moment because my film studies teacher decided to remove it from the curriculum. It is one of my all time favorite films.<br />As I was walking in the door I ripped off the plastic and ran to the DVD player.  I have never done this before.<br />At this price, even without the extras it is worth every penny.  How many movies can you say this about?<br />5 Stars for age 15 and above
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is their best album. I mean, everything was great. The band still had Cliff Burton, who had an amazing talent of reading notes, and this is thrash metal at its best. Better then most bands put out today. This is my second review of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, this time rating them with a 10/10 score:<br />1. Battery 9.5/10<BR>2. Master of Puppets 10/10 THEIR BEST SONG... EVER!!!<BR>3.

Damage, Inc. 9.5/10<br />Overall: A+ (98.0%)= 5 STARS!!!
B000002MZ6|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best album Mike ever created. For Oldfield's enthusiasts, is good to know that it was first time released in 1994 by WEA (Warner Music UK Ltd.). I own this edition (from Germany) and the traks are the same, but the cover is a little bit different. I also heard about a hybrid (data &amp; music) version, but I never find it.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Alicia Keys is not the finest female singer in R&amp;B today (that would be Mary J. Blige), nor the most cutting-edge musician (that would be Missy Elliott), nor the most interesting writer (Jill Scott), nor the most eclectic performer (Macy Gray). But, like, say, Derek Jeter of the Yankees, Ms. Keys is among the very best in all those categories and perhaps the strongest candidate for MVP of the lot. On this, only her second release-she's still a damn kid-she displays the same amazing consistency as she did on her Grammy-gobbling debut. This album contains many of the staples of modern day hip-hop--a thumping bass; synthesizers and computers; a bit of scratching; a handful of producers (including, mostly, her own baad-that means good-self), a couple of featurings (like 'featuring'Tony, Toni, Tone); and a smattering of, if not rap, at least, spoken word. Nevertheless, this is a work reminiscent of some of the great soul artists of another generation. Keys covers Gladys Knight and Dionne Warwick and brings to mind other female R&amp;B singers like Aretha, Chaka, even Marilyn McCoo. Still, the artist she most reminds us of is Stevie Wonder. Like Stevie, she is an extraordinarily talented musician with a wealth of musical knowledge and interests and a scarily easy and natural manner of showing them off. Alicia may not yet have presented us with her &quot;Songs in the 'Keys' of Life&quot;, but we'll certainly savor this one until she does.
0140072187|5.0|I bought this book 9 years ago and been reading through it for more than 20 times!. What catched up my eyes at the first place was a comment on the back cover saying &quot; A stunning book about the right stuff in the wrong war&quot;. Honestly, it really is. Bob demonstrates everything in there, starting the first day he dreamed to fly to the last day he suffered from the flying. The story is well arranged and realistic. I could say I knew all basics of how to fly a chopper from this book. It even includes the HU-1 General Arrangement diagram and Instrument Panel diagram in there. The only frustration is that only at the end, leaving the reader just curious what went wrong with him after he was sentenced by a charge with smuggling. Anyway, it later continued in the Chickenhawk: Back to the world.
0385504209|3.0|This is a good/bad book of great pop cultural interest.  I'll try to tell you what's good and what's bad about it, so you can decide for yourself whether or not to purchase it.<br />First of all, there is the matter of its impact.  A long stay on the best-seller list and a lot of word-of-mouth have led this book to spawn college classes and discussion groups on its controversial pagan thesis and its alternative history.<br />At its best, it's intelligent.  Its descriptions of the physical world of churches and museums are both poetic and sound.  Dan Brown has the kind of mind that enjoys puzzles, symbols, anagrams, encryptions, and every kind of enigma.  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a page-turner whose mysteries keep you interested and zipping along through the text.  It's pagan assertions strike at the very heart of Christian dogma, creating a sort of exhilirating subversion.  That's the good news.<br />The bad news is:  This is one of the most implausible books I've ever read.  Giving us good descriptions of the physical world, Brown neglects to let his characters behave as real people might.  From the beginning we know we'll be asked to suspend a lot of belief, as Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, designs elaborate codes while bleeding to death from a fatal bullet wound.  Aren't most people in shock at this point?  Brown could have been more plausible here by allowing Sauniere to leave a set of clues for his daughter and her cryptologist friend to follow IN CASE he was ever assassinated, but no!...He designs a complex treasure hunt during his death throes!  Brown shows more of his weaknessness as his fiction claims that everything under the sun is a hidden symbol for feminine power and that everyone from Botticelli to Walt Disney was in on the cover-up.  This is a conspiracy theory with everything but a grassy knoll.<br />Some people complain about the ending (Stop reading if you don't want it spoiled), but it's an anti-climax that leaves the story's central mystery intact, which is actually a fitting ending for a novel which is an panegyric to feminine mystique over &quot;masculine&quot; reason.<br />Do I recommend it?  Well, read it if only to see what people are reading these days.  Read it as a gripping page-turner and for its fun puzzles and coincidences.  Christianity deserves every attack against it and more, but one with a tighter, more plausible plot would be appreciated.ystery intact, which is actually a fitting ending for a novel which is an panegyric to feminine mystique over &quot;masculine&quot; reason.  <br />Do I recommend it?

B00005O5JV|5.0|Legally Blonde is an outstanding comedy that can be appreciated by almost everyone.  Anyone who has something against peppy-prissy girls may not want to watch this film.  But for anyone who does not, they will be able to sit back, relax and enjoy the show.  Reese Witherspoon does a wonderful job playing as Elle Woods, a no-common sense, perfect display of stereotypical blonde that we all knew in high school or college.  This comedy provides an almost real life plot as Elle chases after her college boyfriend/ex-boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Mathew Davis), who enrolls into Harvard Law School.  Who would think that girl such as Ella would be able to accomplish so much in such an extreme sorority girl way.  Legally Blonde entices a desire in everyone to be able to stride for what they want.  It left me thinking that if a girl like that can achieve outstanding dreams with hard work, then why can't I.  This film is definitely a good movie for those who would like to find the comedy of every situation.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Until now, we were only lukewarm towards Rufus Wainwright. We bought his first critically acclaimed cd, enjoyed one or two melodious cuts, but found the rest pretentious and boring enough for us to simply pass on his next album. After hearing only one instantly captivating song from 'Want One' on the radio, however, we purchased it with fingers crossed, skeptical yet hopeful of finding more music of worth. Jackpot. If this is not the best pop album of the year, it is likely the most gorgeous and certainly the most epic. The first thing that grabs you is its grandeur. With 'Sgt. Pepper' and 'Pet Sounds' as the prototypes (pretty good prototypes to have, we'd say), nearly every track is thickly layered with complex, majestic orchestrations and luxurious choral arrangements. While there are subtle touches to be found amidst the opulence, one must listen carefully (headphones will help) to catch the wisp of a softly uttered &quot;doo-doo&quot; or the twang of a banjo. But that's like focusing on one mere jewel in the royal crown. Needless to say, one would be as remiss not to mention producer Marius de Vries (whose mere name exudes nobility) as if one were to not credit George Martin for the sound of 'Sgt. Pepper'. But it is Wainwright himself who is responsible for the visceral impact of this work. His nasal vocals are, nonetheless, powerful and moving, enhanced, not overwhelmed, by the production. His lyrics are personal, heartfelt, poetic, witty (with a line like &quot;I tried to dance Britney Spears, I guess I'm getting on in years), and touching. This record is a long, long way from rock &amp; roll as originally conceived by the genre's founders, but a wonderful listening experience nonetheless.
B00005JKES|5.0|I have literally just finished watching this box set, and all the magic i remember of seeing it for the first time came flooding back in waves, but now in better picture quality and digital sound.  It really is compulsive viewing, so much so, that instead of watching an episode a night, i watched them in two days, gasping for more, after the cliffhanger ending! <BR>So not wanting to wait for it to be released in the UK, i thought they are bound to have the next box set out in the US.  But no, whats this ive been reading, ARTISAN are dropping it. I feel like most fans out there, really angry and bloody annoyed, we have waited so long for this programme( judging by the standard of this box set, it was well worth it though )to be released, when other less worthy material gets onto the market.<br />I realise that it costs to remaster, and perhaps profits are not quite as you hoped. So here`s a thought, no-one will bother with the videos, they are such poor quality, but what about releasing the whole series ( or even just follow on from this set ) on just a plain transfer from the original, as i recall, it was produced in Dolby Surround, ok its not 5.1 or DTS but beggars cant be choosers, dont you understand we just want to see the complete set, not just cruelly whet our appetites, and leave us in despair!!   Do the right thing for your buying public, give us what we want, even on this Amazon page it should be clear to you, nearly 300 reviews ?? A bit of a clue, just maybe ?
B0000UJL96|4.0|\\"Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country\\"<br />Review by Wayne A. Klein<br /><br />Boldly going where no cast has gone before--retirement, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise endure one more mission under the direction of Nicholas Meyer (\\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn\\", \\"Time After Time\\" and author of  \\"The Seven Percent Solution\\") Despite some story gaps and flaws in logic, the momentum and action keep \\"Country\\" entertaining something that couldn't be said for the badly flawed \\"Star Trek V\\". Although clearly well beyond his days of gallivanting about the galaxy, James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is pushed into escorting his enemies to a meeting to discuss peace between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets. Kirk still bears scars and anger over the murder of his son by a Klingon commander (in \\"Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock\\").  With witty allusions of Sherlock Holmes, and current history, Country has enough action and humor to satisfy both the devoted Trekkie and the average viewer.<br /><br />It seems that a massive explosion on the moon Praxis has forced the Klingon Empire to seek outside aid from the Federation as the debris of the moon destroying their planet. Led by the Lincolnesque Chancellor Gorkon (the droll and sincere David Warner in a marvelous supporting role), the Klingons are as suspicious of Kirk as he is of them. When the Enterprise inexplicably fires on the ship Kronos 1 and a murder is committed by Enterprise crew members, General Chang (a larger than life Christopher Plummer) arrests Kirk and Dr. McCoy when they beam over to the ship to provide assistance. Returning to the Klingon home world, Kirk and McCoy are put on trial and convicted of assassinating a leading Klingon political leader and sentenced to spend their lives on a distant ice gulag.<br /><br />Meyer's taunt direction and witty script (written with Denny Martin Flinn)helped breath new life into the final entry featuring the original cast. Meyer is to be commended for his direction of the actors as well. William Shatner can easily blow through a scene like a tornado consuming all the audience's attention when he overplays his role. As in \\"Khan\\" Meyer brings out the best in Shatner without letting him chew the scenery too much. Shatner's staccato line readings are also kept in check. He gives one of his best performances as Kirk in the Trek franchise.  Nimoy Nimoy and Kelley are, as always, a delight to watch interact.  Doohan Doohan, Koenig, Takei and Nichols are all given their moments as well. Each plays the comic elements of their particular scenes really well. Something that's often missed about the original cast is their skill as comic players. Humor was a regular feature of many episodes but there were also a number of tongue-in-cheek episodes where the actors displayed their versatility at drama and comedy. The material provided by Meyer and Flinn (with an original story dreamed up by Leonard Nimoy) provides just the right mix of drama, comedy and pathos for the original cast to play.<br /><br />Finally released in its correct widescreen anamorphic aspect ratio (the previous release was widescreen only), \\"Country\\" looks marvelous with rich blacks and a minimum of compression artifacts. As a result, the image looks sharper and richer particularly in scenes involving optical effects. There are virtually no analog artifacts in the form of hair, splotches, etc. on the print used for the transfer. The colors are rich and vibrant looking.  While the color seemed a bit richer on the previous release, clearly this \\"Country\\" features the look that Meyer wanted for his finished film. After the lackluster earlier release from Paramount of the same film, \\"Country\\" wafts in like a cool breeze on a nasty, humid day.<br /><br />While the sound isn't up to par compared to a 2004 theatrical release, the expansive Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround mix has a much more expansive feel than the previous edition of the DVD. The unusual orchestral score by Cliff Eidelman finally gets its due; the opening fanfare captures all the raw excitement evident in the film itself. Eidelman's score compares favorably to Jerry Goldsmith's score for Star Trek: The Motion Picture and sounds just as great here as Goldsmith's did on that remastered DVD from a couple of years ago.<br /><br />Some of the dialog sounds a bit \\"flat\\" without much depth but usually this is most noticeable in scenes where there is little else going on in the way of sound effects and music score. Otherwise, the remastered sound marvelously captures the best elements of the theatrical release. The rich sound effects and background ambiance hasn't sounded this good since the film's original theatrical release in 1990. There are some minor flaws with the sound due to the use of compression to fatten up the sound of the film but, again, that's a very minor issue.<br /><br />Paramount decided to spring for most of the extras with Country. While there are no deleted scenes or any gag reels, out takes, etc. the film comes packed with a number of attractive feaurettes and trailers. Since Meyer's Director's Cut was released on laserdisc, home video and DVD previously, there aren't any new extended scenes in the film. It does appear, though, that Meyer may have done some more trimming here and there to enhance the film. We have an engaging audio commentary on disc one by director Meyer and co-screenwriter Denny Martin Flinn. Meyer tends to occasionally go off on some wild tangents but, on the whole, stays focuses on the day-to-day difficulty of producing the film. He and Flinn also discuss scenes that were cut from the original script prior to production due to cost<br /><br />Almost all the extras are located exclusively on the second disc. There's six feaurturettes on the making of the film entitled \\"Movie Making\\". All six can be played together or separately. There's also a section on The Star Trek Universe which focuses on the background of Gene Roddenberry's original creation and Meyer's take on the same raw material. Meyer has made no secret that he saw Star Trek as Horatio Hornblower in outer space and that's relayed clearly in this feature as well as the first film of the franchise he directed (\\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn\\"). Universe consists of a number of notable feaurettes including \\"Klingons: Conjuring a Legend\\".<br /><br />The section about the inspiration of the film is particularly compelling. \\"Art Imitates Life: The Perils of Peacemaking it focuses on the real life inspiration for The Undiscovered Country including the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The most touching piece, though, is the tribute to an under rated actor. DeForest Kelley made his debut in Fear in the Night from 1947. This short tribute focuses on the film and television roles he inhabited outside of Star Trek. Featuring interviews with colleagues and producers from the beginning and latter part of his career, \\"Deforest Kelley: A Tribute\\" captures all the warmth and magic of this consummate character actor who finally found his niche as Dr. McCoy.<br /><br />The original cast and crew interviews as well as the trailers are included. Additionally, there's an excerpt from a 1991 convention presentation by director Meyer. Finally, we have an Archives section consisting of production photos, storyboards and assorted odds and ends that didn't quite fit into other parts of the disc.  I personally found the extras here more rewarding than on any other Trek film release with the possible exception of  Robert Wise's Director's Edition of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\". While \\"Country\\" doesn't differ as significantly as \\"ST:TMP\\", the minor tweaking that Meyer did for the previously issued laserdisc version helped clarify plot points and improve the overall pacing of the film. My only complaint is that, unlike the recent re-release of \\"Alien\\", \\"Country\\" doesn't offer the original theatrical version in an extended branching edition so fans can compare both head to head.<br /><br />.<br />Although Shatner, Koenig and Doohan appeared in one more Trek film (\\"Star Trek: Generations\\" which featured The Next Generation cast and which will be issued in March in a Special Director's Edition as well), \\"Country\\" clearly was intended as the final voyage of the original crew.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was just plain fun. Our family is savoring these eposides by spacing out the watching of them. Look forward to any movie from this show.
B00005JM02|5.0|One of the most delightful films in ages. A film for the whole family. Intelligent, funny, and well made. The graphics are incredible looking. Once again, if it isn't comic books or Star Trek, then dvdowner doesn't get it.
B000077VR3|1.0|Movie:  Absolutely boring and messy.  Kidman is gorgeous, but does not save a film that was made for no apparent reasons.<br />DVD:  Good quality but does not save a film that's devoid of any content.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This movie is not for everyone---let's just get that out of the way right now.  I think most know that there is an intensely realistic rape scene, and I am not going to go into as much detail as others because I don't want to spell it all out.<br />Yes, the rape scene is hard to watch---IT SHOULD BE.  I am tired of movies that gloss over the ugliness of rape, murder and other violent acts.  As a woman (most other reviewers are male) I want men to see this movie to understand how horrifying rape really is.  It happens every day, all over the world, you should know what is going on around you.<br />That said, what made this movie compelling to me was not only the unspooling of events in reverse (which the director used to different effect than Memento), but the stamp the preceeding events leave as you watch the later (earlier?) ones.  I found it very sad to watch this beautiful young woman on the grass, completely unaware of the horrible turn her life would take so soon.<br />Entertaining?  I guess that depends on your views.  If you just want to laugh at the movies, this is not for you.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld looked fairly light and cheesy in the previews, so I avoided a theater trip and just rented the DVD.  I was mistaken.  It's actually an entertaining romp that is mostly eye candy but does have some interesting acting in it.  The somewhat goofy premise is as follows:<br />Long ago, a human was born whose body was able to rapidly alter itself to resist environmental conditions.  This allowed him to survive a plague that destroyed his village.  His children inherited that trait.  One was bitten by a bat and spawned a race of vampires, while another was bitten by a wolf and spawned a race of werewolves (a.k.a. lycans).  A third did neither and hence the trait also survived in 'normal' humans.  This divergence of races was long ago forgotten, and vampires and werewolves are now at one another's throats (har har) over a millenia of real and imagined slights.  Kate Beckinsale plays a melodramatically-named 'Death Dealer', a vampire devoted to fighting lycans, who falls in love with a lycan candidate.  Unbeknownst to all but a few tricky lycans, that candidate is a descendent of the 'human' strain of the original sire of all three races, and has the potential to become a hybrid vampire/lycan.  Much mayhem and throat biting commences.<br />Now, it's pretty obvious from the get-go that logic needs to get chucked out the window.  Similarly, there's about as many sparks flying between Beckinsale and her love interest as there is between the mayonnaise and bologna in a bad deli sandwich.  However the film does a surprisingly, almost effort-savingly good job of representing the various packs of night critters involved.  The lycans impressively shape shift into massive, combat-oriented werewolves whenever angered (quite similar to another underappreciated recent film, 'Dog Soldiers'), and while the vampires don't do a lot of typically vampiric things like mind control or turning into packs of rats, they at least manage the 'gaunt and world-weary' thing well.  You also get a sense of the hide-bound nature of their world, which is based on the endless rule of centuries-old elders and ancients, with newer vampires stuck in an immortality bereft of change or advancement.  There are some great action sequences, a lot of fine back stabbing, and generally a great deal of enthusiasm on all sides when the fur starts flying.  It really is almost enough to make up for the paper-thin plot and makes for a perfect summer movie..grab some popcorn and just enjoy the ride.<br />On a side note, the general plot and themes seem to have been basically lifted wholesale from an entire book/RPG system of vampires v. werewolves that has been published by White Wolf for decades, to such an extent that I thought White Wolf had sponsored the film.  Apparently not, given the fact they're suing over it (see the 'quotes and trivia' link in the product description above).  If you've ever heard of them, you may be interested in this film as well.et a sense of the hide-bound nature of their world, which is based on the endless rule of centuries-old elders and ancients, with newer vampires stuck in an immortality bereft of change or advancement.

0316666343|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.... It is so beautiful. I cried first when Susie's father broke all of the bottled ships he had built with her. And I mean I SOBBED! I've never cried while reading a book and I've read more than I can count. By the time I finished reading (1 day! I couldn't put it down!) I must have cried at least 7 times. And I love the ending. Never saw that coming! Amazing! A must read!!!!!!
B0000AZT72|4.0|I found this DVD title at my local New York Public Library branch and was intrigued by the title and also I vaguely remembered a trailer I saw in theaters last spring or summer.<br />First thing I noticed about the movie was how much better the print is compared to the typical Hong Kong flick.  Most HK films are grainy and greenishly dark, plus they are edited in weird ways.  (Admitted I haven't seen many HK movies but the ones I've seen always made me feel motionsick afterwards.)  The visuals on this film, on the other hand, are clean and well-balanced, with good color tones, albeit a bit high on the orange/yellow side.<br />The storyline is interesting but uneven at places.  The first hour of the 100-minute film is about how the players come together to form the team, and then the final match for the rest of the film.  There are a lot of funny moments, but also some jokes that could baffle a Western viewer.  Furthermore, there's a lot of oblique references to homosexuality, such as when the fat boy eats his precious chicken eggs off the stockbroker guy, and an unnecessarily excessive amount of male leg exposes.  A few scenes are superfluous and make the first half boring at times (e.g., the bar scene).<br />The movie is dominated by computer-generated special effects.  A &quot;making of&quot; featurette reveals much of the action was filmed with blue screens.  But I have to say the effects are quite good, and more refreshing than the stuff put out by Hollywood these days.  Most of the human-computer action sequences are well spliced together and therefore enjoyable.<br />Overall, Shaolin Soccer is an enjoyable film for every comedy fan, but especially for the martial arts and soccer crowds.  The HK version I saw feels uneven in many places, maybe that's why the U.S. theatrical release has been pushed back again and again.  Whether you rent it or borrow it from the library, it's a worthwhile movie to watch.
B000085RTZ|4.0|This album seems to be almost universally loved by fans of this type of music and I must say that I like it more and more with each listen. As with Karma, I think Kamelot's (only) problem is that they haven't really got any SUPERB songs...none of their songs suck, many are really good (a Feast for the Vain, excellent), but....still, the final strokes of genius are missing, so to say. BUT: That being said, Kamelot is an outstanding band with super technical skill, imaginative lyrics (even more so when you compare them with the lyrics of Stratovarius, for example), really good overall sound (each instrument sounds like it should, no Iron Maiden-drumsound here)....I recommend this album to all lovers of melodic, bombastic, heavy metal:). And like I said, I think this album in particular is one you will like more and more with time, the first listenings maybe won't do the trick (happened to me).
B000001GQD|2.0|Have you ever wondered why Karajan ONLY performed with young musicians after his recording with Richter? Think about it. Why is that every soloist his age he recorded with, never made another record with him. Answer. Because Karajan could not control the soloist. The young ones looked up to him and Karjan could mold them into what ever musician he wanted. Hence, we have brilliant playing by Richter, but TERRIBLE conducting by Herbert Von Karajan. Richter's playing is breathtaking as usual, but the conducting is cold, non expressive and rough. What's Richter supposed to do? If you want the Tchaikovsky, there are many other versions available, and many are superior to this one. If you want the perfect combination of virtuoisity from the pianist and great leadership from the conductor, go with Earl Wild on Chesky. His performance with Fistoulari is quite possibly the greatest version on disk. American Record Guide selected Wild as the number one choice for this work. Of course there are others, Gilels with Reiner, Ogden with Monteux, and three different ones with Argerich. Any of these would be a better choice than this one. Richter has other versions with different conductors. Go with them instead of Karajan.
B0000UJL96|4.0|It took me a while to like \\"Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country\\".  It is noticeably different in feel from its predecessors (darker, more revisionist), and this put me off a bit- I used to lump it in with the bad \\"Star Trek\\" films, such as \\"The Final Frontier\\" and \\"Generations\\".  However, the movie has grown on me the last couple years, and I now see it as a quality entry in the series.<br />I wouldn't say there's anything outstanding about \\"The Undiscovered Country\\", but instead it's a steadily entertaining adventure.  The visuals are markedly improved over the previous Trek films, especially \\"The Final Frontier\\".  However, \\"The Undiscovered Country\\"'s real strength is in its story and acting.  The movie shows two competing empires' attempt to reconcile their differences and end the insane arms race that they're engaged in.  Its main theme- peace is the only way- may seem hokey to some, but I found it to be a very good one.  There's a lot of symbolism going on in this film, and the Special Edition interviews help you to see just how large of goals the filmakers had.<br />The Trek regulars give among their best performances here.  William Shatner- thankfully removed from the director's chair- gives a subtle and effective performance, easily his best one since \\"The Search for Spock\\".  The other Trek regulars, aware that this was their final film, give their performances all that they've got, especially Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan.  I think it's nice that director Nicholas Meyer decided to give them all their time in the spotlight for this film.  The non-Trek regulars are effective as well, but they fade behind Christopher Plummer- his General Chang is gleefully over the top, and one of the best Trek villains ever.  Even though he's not given a lot of screen time, he manages to make a lasting impression.<br />If I have one complaint, it's with the movie's ending.  After director Meyer finishes the film's great space battle, he seems eager to wrap things up, and theentire \\"second assassination\\" scene feels like an afterthought.  Also, too much time was spent on the \\"whodunit\\" aspect of the film- it's not too hard to pinpoint the conspirators early on (come on, did anyone really think Chang was a goodguy?)<br />Overall though, \\"The Undiscovered Country\\" is a very enjoyable movie, and a worthy entry into the Trek franchise.  It seems even better when compared with its immediate predecessor, \\"The Final Frontier\\".  If you don't like it on the first viewing, give it some time and it will surely grow on you.

6305882592|5.0|\\"Harold and Maude\\" is not really a love story in the conventional romantic sense. It's more of a story about how one person can change another person's life just by being themself. Harold is a wealthy, bored, morose young man who gets his kicks by attending funerals of people he doesn't know and staging elaborate, fake suicides to rattle his mother. At one funeral he happens to meet Maude, another \\"funeral crasher\\". Maude, about to turn 80, is starting to wonder if her own death shouldn't be coming soon. The two quickly embark on a friendship (and, yes, even sexual relationship) which completely changes Harold's views on life. Maude is one of the greatest characters I've ever seen portrayed on film. At the same time daring and sensitive, childlike and wise, rebellious and spiritual, Maude is an elderly iconoclast whose fierce love of life has inspired her to free herself of almost all of society's restrictions. Frankly, she's my hero. At times touching, funny, inspiring and strange, \\"Harold and Maude\\" is one of my favorite films of all time.
B00005LC1H|5.0|The first time I watched Fawlty Towers I didn't think I'd like it. But i was hooked. Every episode was just as funny as the last. I recommend watching Fawlty Towers to anyone.
6305508550|5.0|WOW, this is an awesome movie! From the opening scene, it sets the mood of the movie. Very funny movie, with a cast that works very well together. Pretty much a movie about a guy who is finding himself hating his job and life. Its is great watching him go from an uptight geek to a layed back cool cat. Office Space hasnt been seen by many people but it is not a waste of time. I tell you the copy machine scene..haaaaa , priceless..
B00005YW4H|1.0|Well I am not impressed. I think she should develop her own style and stop the Macy Grey undertones. I notice a lot of people are commenting on her appearance, that should be irrelevant when it comes to great musical talent. Unfortunately it seems to add an extra star to a review if someone thinks you physically appeal to them as well....which is silly.
B000089RVX|5.0|I decided to buy this cd since I'd heard &quot;bring me to life&quot; and &quot;going under&quot;. Evanescence is a band who can really make good music. On this album you can find heavy rock songs like Going Under, Everybody's Fool, Taking Over Me but also peaceful and fragile ones like My Immortal and Hello. There are also songs where you can get little more out of them like Whisper, Imaginary and Haunted, which bring little bit personality on this cd. The things that I also love on this album are Amy's beautiful voice and the sad lirycs.
0385504209|1.0|This book by Dan Brown has clearly got to be the most atrocious jumble of fabrications and bias against Christianity I've ever read. I despised having to give it a quality rating (for its worth) of even 1, seeing as there no rating for 0. First of all, Dan Brown claims that there is a secret society, named the Priory of Sion, which he also claims was led by well-known people like Da Vinci, Newton, and Victor Hugo. Except that what Dan Brown really did was mix a bunch of famous names together into a secret society that they were not a part of. The horrible fabrications of fact made me lose my respect for it and more than once I was fuming with with the blatantly twistedness of the information.
B00006F83Y|4.0|I must say I only own this because it was a gift and I very much liked it. A very mellow album , it has its highs and lows but over all I very much enjoyed it.
B000021XS0|5.0|Look, if you haven't heard this, than you are missing out on literally the most amazing work of musical art in history. This is my third time reviewing this album, but I just can't say enough. DT can play better than 95% if not 100% of the music world known to the radio(or not on the radio for that matter). It's sad really when you think of how naive the people who revolve their whole musical life around the radio are to amazing and moving music. Dream Theater is simply unmatched at ability as an entire group. Every instrument is played by a viruoso. &quot;Scenes&quot; displays this fact well all through the album. An example is in &quot;Fatal Tagedy&quot; around 9:06 when Jordan Rudess(keyboard) and John Petrucci(gutiar) play in unison(which in itself is amazing) a phrase that I put money on that only a handful of musican can play. That's just an example. There's many other times through the entire album that leaves me personally so mind-bloggled at how they did it, that it send chills down my spine each and every time I hear it. If you haven't heard this, go buy it now. It will move you like no other album has or ever will.
0446525537|5.0|Have you ever had your heartstrings pulled so hard that you tear up and whimper inside? I have... this is because of the wonderful modern day romance novel, A Walk to Remember written by Nicholas Sparks. Landon Carter, the seventeen year old, city boy protagonist gets very confused about life and especially love. He thinks he has fallen in love several times. Landon Carter learns what true love is. He falls in love with Jamie Sullivan, the minister's daughter. Also known as the class \\"geek\\" and \\"weirdo\\" because she helps everyone she can. Is helping people really a crime? By falling in love with Jamie, Landon finds out the true, kind, wonderful person Jamie is inside. Landon Carter deals with a devastating conflict about love. He becomes truly hurt deep down inside when he finds out his one and only true love has leukemia. Will Landon reject Jamie because he feels so guilty about being so healthy yet she's dying? Some people back right away when they find out about their loved one being deathly sick. Is this because of their own fear or because they are greedy and only want the best from their loved one?<BR> Nicholas Spark's romance novel is a wonderful book. I really enjoyed reading it. I loved that the story was based on how a seventeen year old found his first true love, but it wasn't too gushy. I thought that Nicholas Sparks showed how Landon had many different emotions. For example, Landon fell in love with Jamie and showed lots of affection, and after he felt so upset when he found out Jamie had leukemia. Nicholas Sparks made you not want to put down the book but keep turning the pages. I liked how I felt the emotions that were going on inside of Landon. I saw every image that went inside his head, the regrets that he felt, and finally, every tear that fell down on his face. Nicholas Sparks made me laugh, cry and enjoy his wonderful romance novel. I don't think anything in the story itself should change. Although, I do have one thing that I didn't like. I didn't like how Jamie had to die, but then again that was part of this wonderful romance novel.
B000089RVX|5.0|Originally I purchased this album for one song, &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;, but I was totally astonished of the quality and substance of all the other songs on this album.  I listen to the songs every day and I just can't get enough of the songs and eclectic style of the band.  <br />In my opinion this band and their debut album need more recognition, more public exposure.  There are very few albums and bands of this caliber today.<br />Awsome songs, lyrics and style.
0452282152|3.0|I've finished, not being able to put this down. Does that make it a good book? <br />Somehow, there wasn't enough there to make me appreciate Griet, the female lead, as a person. Her outlook struck me as arificial, her decision formalised, like a 'Candide' character, always out to comment, illustrate, educate. It's the narrative voice that annoys me, which is meant to be that of a 16 year old girl in Vermeer's Holland. But, even accounting for having to grow up early in those times, her thinking and tone is too much that of a shrewd, middle aged woman, and it grates on me. It reads like one of those historical `young adult' novels which try to educate without anybody noticing. I'm enjoying it, though, in a kind of this-may-grate-but-I-don't-want-to-stop-reading-it kind of way.<br />The ending was a disappointment to me, even though it's had its rationale in Griet's previous decisions. I expected more, something less abrupt, some growth into an unusual direction, rather than doing 'the expected'. I wanted to be surprised, pleasantly or unpleasantly, and the conclusion of the story didn't do that.<br />What saved the novel for me were Vermeer's paintings, the beautiful conjecture on their conception, the artists eye through which Chevalier looks at the past.
B000127LW2|3.0|Voyager, despite its many problems, started off decent.  A ship 75,000 lightyears away from home with a culturally deverse crew was a good idea.  However, the way in which the show was handled was awful.  The dealta quadrent looks just like the alpha quadrent, with aliens that are identical and plots that jump right off TNG story lines.  Although a good try, Voyager missed the mark completely as the show progressed.  If you are looking for good sci-fi shows check out DS9 and Babylon 5.  Not only are the boxsets cheaper, but they are better shows to boot.
B00011D1OA|5.0|By the time \\"My Fair Lady\\" made it to the big screen, going to see the movie wasn't so much a night's entertainment as it became a near religeous experience. Jack L. Warner wanted Cary Grant as Prof. Henry Higgins but Grant declined, giving the studio boss no choice but to cast Rex Harrison in the lead - an inspired choice since Rex had already made the part his own on Broadway. The unfortunate oversight is that Jack Warner couldn't see Julie Andrews true potential beneath her common frumpery of the cockney flower girl. So in stepped Audrey Hepburn - delightful, charming, outstanding...alas, she couldn't sing! Her vocals - dubbed by Marni Nixon, became the subject of controversy that cost Audrey her Best Actress Oscar nomination. That went to Julie Andrews for \\"Mary Poppins\\". So did the win!<BR>The plot: Two stuffy academics decide to overhaul a flower girl into a grand duchess. With a little bit of luck and a lot of comical training the job gets done and the result is a truly charming story elevated by exceptional production values and a thoroughly engaging musical score!<BR>TRANSFER: OUTSTANDING!!! Colors are rich, vibrant and solid. Black and contrast levels are perfect. There are NO age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for a picture that is, quite simply - PERFECT. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is brilliant, robust and thoroughly engaging for a film of this vintage. <BR>EXTRAS: By george, I think they've got it! The original 1994 documentary which illustrates the film's near destruction and its breathtaking restoration is included for the first time on DVD, as well as a host of other extras including an audio commentary, multiple featurettes, snippets from the Oscar cerimony, theatrical trailers, a stills gallery and some commentaries by noted film makers and historians. Outstanding!!!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: It isn't often that I can make the argument that nothing more could be asked for or expected of a classic movie's treatment on DVD. \\"My Fair Lady\\" is one of those 2 disc miracles of 'loverlieness' that has been timelessly and completely realized for the home theater film buff!

B00011D1RC|3.0|\\"Grand Hotel\\" concerns guests staying at Berlin's Grand Hotel. There's the high strung, tempermental ballerina (Greta Garbo), the sassy vamp-like stenographer (Joan Crawford), the boorish industrialist (Wallace Beery), the stricken labourer (Lionel Barrymore)and the devilishly handsome baron (John Barrymore). These seemingly separate lives cross over - some happily so, others with tragic circumstances - all thoroughly absorbing and brilliantly performed. At the time of its release \\"Grand Hotel\\" was the first movie to feature more than one star above the title credits.<BR>TRANSFER: After years of looking as though the camera negative had been fed through a meat grinder, this DVD digital remastering is a considerable improvement. Having said that, a lot of work is still needed to get this one looking up to par. Solid blacks are about the best thing on this DVD. Contrast levels appear too low in many of the scenes. There are a considerable number of age related artifacts and quite a bit of film grain present on this 70 plus year old classic. The audio has been extensively cleaned up but continues to exhibit considerable hiss. Truly, if this is a special edition it's one of the poorest I've seen. <BR>EXTRAS: Some featurettes that round out the history - if too briefly, of this classic film.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: \\"Grand Hotel\\" is undeniably engrossing and a brilliant Oscar winner that is sure to enthrall for decades to come! For the film and NOT the transfer, this is an absolute must for your film library!!!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|When I was five years old, my dad had to draw a picture of a pistol on one side of my Johnny Cash 45 so I could play &quot;Don't Take Your Guns to Town&quot; over and over on the stereo without bugging my mom to tell me which side of the record to play.  Almost 45 years later, I'm still in love with this man's voice.<br />I bought this album for &quot;Hurt&quot; but was totally blown out of the water by &quot;The Man Comes Around.&quot;  This song is the most incredible finale for The Man in Black.  Its Apocalyptic message stands as a subtle call to Faith.  It still gives me goose bumps each and every time I listen to it.  Additionally, his renditions of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;Danny Boy&quot; are poignant and profound.  When he sings &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; it seems I am eavesdropping on a conversation between him and June Carter that I shouldn't be.   The last cut, &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; is a sweet and tender good-bye to the world.  His voice is as incredible as it ever was, many more so.<br />This album will always be my favorite of all favorites.
0784010501|3.0|The documentary itself is very good. I like that only the performances were shot in color. Madonna's life is quite active so this was never boring. However, I think if Madonna watched this film today she'd be ashamed of the attention whore she was (or perhaps she still is). A lot of this seemed like Madonna was constantly aware of the cameras rolling. Even her visit to her mother's grave seemed \\"Hollywood\\" (there was even a soundtrack playing to it). The only really human moment was when Madonna was asked who the love of her life was. <br />In case you want to know: \\"Sean\\".
B00005JMGL|5.0|I just returned from seeing the film for the second time and found it more enchanting than ever - a perfect blend of truly magical special effects, faithful script adaptation and flawless acting. Jeremy Sumpter captures all of Peter's engaging egotism as well as his tragic vulnerability; Rachel Hurd-Wood glows with intelligence, charm and spirit; and Jason Isaacs masters his duel role to perfection. If there were any justice, this film would have been nominated for multiple Oscars, certainly for Script Adaptation and Special Effects. The sight of the pirate ship sailing the fogs of London is worth the price of admission, and the relationship between Peter and Wendy - including their aerial dance - is as romantic as anything I've seen in years. Much as I loved \\"Return of the King,\\" \\"Peter Pan\\" reminds me more of the pure bliss I felt watching \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" unadulterated by problems with the adaptation. \\"Peter Pan\\" captures all the subtleties of Barrie's multi-layered writing with touches of its own fairy dust.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Okay not really, but this movie comes so close to VTM that White Wolf Publishing, Inc sued the filmmakers. The funny thing is that it's the similarities to VTM that are this otherwise shallow and hokie movie's redeeming features. See this film is entertaining, it's not horrible, but it's not great either. It's certainly better than any other vampire movie I've seen of late, which is sad really... It's just disturbing to me that the only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was watching for subtle not-so-unintentional similarities to Vampire the Masquerade.<br /> The irony is that having been a rabid White Wolf addict-fan for the last thirteen years I have had my level of expectations for vampire movies and literature raised so high that even White Wolf themselves can't always meet the expectations because so much of their past work has been beyond excellent. Its difficult for anything to live up so such expectations without ripping off the World of Darkness completely, and while I don't think that was the intention of this film they did come pretty close to doing that, and I really hate to say it, but if they had just ripped off more elements of Vampire the Masquerade and Werewolf the Apocalypse the movie, including the brilliant narrative of the White Wolf writing staff, and we would have had a masterpiece of a vampire movie, up there with Interview with the Vampire. Instead all we have is a few (like 60 according to White Wolf's lawyers) points of similarities mixed in with Romeo and Juliet, minus the tragic ending, and without any real character development, or decent dialogue, plus characters who don't realize that when you're pumped full of silver nitrate you're supposed to be dead, as in no getting up... I think the lesson that needs to be learned from this movie isn't &quot;don't rip of Vampire The Masquerade&quot; it's &quot;For crying out loud you know you want to, just make Vampire: The Masquerade into a movie!&quot; There's more than enough material to go on there, you could even make a 13 volume movie series based off the clan novels, I mean really they're great! Let's stop making these cheesy wanna-be vampire movies and go for the real thing! Come-on Sony! You know you want to! Only be sure to get Justin Achili to write your screenplay.go on there, you could even make a 13 volume movie series based off the clan novels, I mean really they're great!

0375751513|5.0|It is very easy to see why this novel is a classic, i do not know about other people conclusions but for me it shows simply that our own mind is a very hard judge for us, humans; and that our natural behavior hardly ever gonna live up to our mind expectations.
B000002HK4|5.0|A Change of Seasons is without a doubt, my favourite song of all time. The album I could take or leave as a whole. This gets 5 stars because of the title track. Its the most amazing song ive ever heard, great from 0:00 to 23:08. Crimson Sunset = best part in the song \m/ ^_^ \m/.<br />The covers = boring, because its bascially the same thing with LaBrie singing. I could just pull out my other cd's and listen to them<br />5/5 by me though<br />-Matt
B000001FDQ|5.0|OK, here is the real story. I dont [care] about all the press. Yngwie is a genious. This reocrd will blow your mind. Theres nothing else to it. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLK0|3.0|The beginning of the movie really distracted me from everything else. Hmm let's see.. a 300mph razorwire, slicing through hundreds of men and women, sinews and thick frothy blood, intestines seeping out,unraveling flesh, viscerally opened people. Kinda got to me. I felt pretty ... sick after that.<br />If you can't handle the intestine spurting genre,i'd steer clear.
B00007L4OM|2.0|Wasabi, one of the latest products of Luc Besson sector. However anti-American movie fans have raised their `Yankee Go Home' banners; to my mind this comedy - action film which is harmonized with French - Japon sensibilities, can be an alternative film to American movies.<br />Luc Besson - Jean Reno cooperation is going on. Leading character Hubert is a puncher policeman just like in American movies, ignoring legal details, fighting against the bad people. Again just like in American movies, Hubert has a chief who is complaining and shouting all the times; at the other hand he likes Hubert. Love book of Hubert is empty for 19 years, after a Japon woman has broken his heart and left him with memories, meal descriptions and a beautiful pen. Hubert has closed his love book and has focused on crime world. Then he learns that his Japan woman has died and has left him an inheritance: a daughter. Time for a Japan voyage.<br />Just focusing on the story, it is easy to think that this film doesn't have any difference from American ones. But this film isn't an American popcorn movie; it is a French / Japan popcorn movie.<br />There are enough big guns, rocket launchers, bombs; but the action scenes is not in American style, Hubert generally finishes his work quickly with one punch. In American movies the bullets let people fly backward for 2 meters; Hubert can fly people for 5 meters. <br />Sense of humor which is full of small coincidences and comic events is extremely French. Lets turn to the Japan side of the film: there are many Japan people.  The beautiful girl of the film is Hubert's Japan daughter Yumi. I find her very cute with her teenage gestures and phone talks beginning with `mochie, mochie'. <br />By this film, I've surprised that there are many Japan including policemen and mobsters speaking French very well.<br />If you want to watch a French (and a little Japan) comedy - action movie similar with American ones (but not in American style), I'll advice you thisfilm. At worst you will lose time.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Good movie, bad movie, whatever.  I enjoyed &quot;Underworld&quot; despite some plot holes, ridiculous ammo counts in the guns, and general wussiness on the vampires' part.<br />My gripe is with the technical aspects of the DVD itself.  Yes, I'm behind in the times, but I don't have surround sound in my living room.  I've watched this DVD at a friend's house, and it sounded SPECTACULAR.  However, I've tried watching the DVD at home, and I'm just plain baffled.  Guns will be raised, people will fall, and I'll have to assume someone was shot, because the gun will make no sound.  There are other weird parts too, where Lucian extrudes the bullets for example.  I KNOW that APC's Judith remix plays during the scene, but I don't hear it all, although the bullets landing on the floor sound crystal clear.  <br />I can only assume they mixed it for Dolby 5.1 only, because there isn't a stereo/surround-sound choice in the Audio setup, just English and French.  Maybe I should watch it in French some time, and see if they get more sounds.
B00013PHGS|5.0|The album is quite good but I would highly recommend the limited edition version with the DVD--very enjoyable to look at and the live versions are very pleasant!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I bought this cd because it was only $7.99 at Target and I wanted something to listen to on the ride back to school after Christmas break. Let me tell you what, I am in love with the CD and I have listened to it so many times. All of the songs on here are amazing and Gavin is an amazing singer/writer, having written all the songs himself. I was thrilled to learn that he was the singer of the One Tree Hill theme song, as I think that is a great song. I greatly encourage the purchase of this cd, for you will not be wasting your money or time.
B000001FI7|5.0|The essence of trip-hop.  A must have!
B00006SFLV|4.0|I love this show. Both in high school, and even now. I was worried initially buying the DVD as to whether I would have grown out of it or not, but I think that they did such a good job of appealling to everyone that I can still watch it and enjoy it.<br />My only problem is that the DVD offers no special features, no audio commentary, no nothing. While the picture quality and sound is great, that's not the only reason I buy DVD's. Give us something else for our money!
B0000AOV85|5.0|What Dark Side of the Moon did for music, this DVD does for behind the scenes of album production. I figured this would be amusing, but it is far more than that. A must have for anybody that is interested in record production as well as for all Floyd fans. Plus some of the interviews are real eye openers. You will love it!!!
0156027321|4.0|A wonderful story of adventure and truth, Yann Martel's Life of Pi brings credit to the imaginative style of writing.  In this easy to read novel, Martel puts the reader on a lifeboat with Pi Patel, and his father's Bengal Tiger.  What follows is a survival story that will test a reader's viewpoint of the real and non-real-if it matters at all.<BR> It isn't necessary to read up on religion or animal behaviors to understand the logic of Pi and his efforts to survive.  Being the son of a zookeeper and member of three religions, Pi puts readers' doubts away through explanations that sometimes seem counterintuitive.  In a unique perspective, Pi views all religions as different vehicles of getting closer to the one God that matters.  \\"Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.\\"    The story is presented through the eyes of Pi today, looking back in first person at the younger Pi in crisis.  Though this style spoils the question of whether or not Pi lives to see land again, it let's the reader in on Pi's later life-a relief to anyone who becomes attached to Pi while reading.<BR> Yann Martel's question of truth is fully developed throughout the story, and concluded wonderfully in the end.  The correlations between Pi's two tales can be seen without a keen eye.  But if you're lucky enough to have good insight, you'll make observations that will give you a large respect for Martel's in-depth work.  Does it matter if an entertaining story conveys the same meaning as the real one, but the former is given?  Martel quells pessimistic views that would scream \\"Yes!\\" to this in a unique fashion.  After reading this story, you may look upon the Bible in a new light (and maybe you should read Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code right after if you'd like to continue your religion escapades).<BR> Pi goes through great extremesand emotional bouts while during his time on the ocean.  His relationship with Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, changes over time-but disappoints in the end.  Pi's obsession with meaning and conclusions are left to dry with Richard's departure.  Goodbye's and conclusions are a large part of Pi's belief, which explain why the novel is presented in exactly 100 chapters.  Though the book itself is a piece of fiction, readers will want to believe in the story.  This \\"want\\" of ours to believe in what we know is false is directly related to the Bible.  Though Yann Martel doesn't elaborate on the Bible itself, his point gets across.  The clever correlations between Pi's two stories will have the reader thinking for days.  This is a book you might want to read twice after working your mind around the first time through.  Accordingly, Yann Martel's page turner was awarded the Man Booker Prize, a prestigious award given to the best Novel in the commonwealth annually.<BR> The desperate measures brought upon Pi will force the reader to understand how human's can learn to do anything.  Once a vegetarian, Pi eventually eats raw fish, turtle, and shark.  Delicacies come in the form of algae, meerkats, seaweed, and uncooked crabs.  Pi shows that everyday objects we take for granted will take a new light when your life is being challenged.  Pi's clever nature makes use of the lifeboat's materials to keep himself safe from both Richard and the elements.  With rations to last 90 days, Pi lives at sea for 227 days before being rescued.  He goes from optimism to blind desperation.  Life of Pi effectively captures the reader.<BR> A calm and somewhat eerie confidence is shown in Pi's concluding voice.  By this time he's grappled his concept of truth, and ventures out to challenge two investigators who question his story and knowledge of the ships sinking.  The interview brings out the final point of whether or not truth matters if the meaning is the same.  The type of reader who isn't fearful of having their beliefs challenged will love Life of Pi.  After a heart wrenching interpretation of this adventure under a new light, Pi has just one question to ask.  \\"So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you can't prove the question either way, which story do you prefer?  Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?\\"

0385512104|4.0|Everyone has encountered someone with a disability or condition thats reminded us of how fortunate we are.  We may have felt sorry, been confused or even annoyed at the person because we cant see the world the way they do.  In Mark Haddons novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, he goes into the mind of an autistic child named Christopher John Francis Boone.  Written by Christopher, the book pulls the reader into the reasoning behind an autistic mind.  Though every case of autism is slightly different, Christophers view is enough to teach the reader many things about the condition, and draw them into the harsh realities Chris faces in the novel.  Because of Christophers autism, the language doesnt flow very well, but the story progresses to an ending that doesnt leave the reader disappointed.<BR> Christopher hooks the reader quickly by opening his book with a murder mystery before telling a little about himself.  There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog.  The points of the fork must have gone all the way through the dog and into the ground because the fork had not fallen over (1).  His lack of emotion behind the murder seems cold, which is the first sign of his autism.  My name is Christopher John Francis Boone.  I know all the countries of the world and their capital cities and every prime number up to 7,057 (2).  Christopher reveals to the reader his memory and mathematical abilities quickly.  These attributes are developed throughout the book and are critical to Christophers ability to function in everyday life.<BR> Christopher cannot be held, cannot understand human emotions and cannot find meaning through interactions.  He [Christophers Father] held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan.  I held up my left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we made our fingers and thumbs touch each other.  We do this because sometimes Father wants to give me a hug, but I do not like hugging people so we do this instead, and it means that he loves me (16).  Mark Haddons unique narration through Christopher makes the novel painfully funny and sad as a boy who cannot understand emotions endeavors to solve a mystery that uncovers life changing truths that will forever affect Christophers life.<BR> The chapters are numbered off by prime numbers.  Just ten pages into the book and youll find yourself in the middle of chapter 17.  A wonderfully logical and gifted mind is shown when Christopher describes his maths and shares his curiosities, history and goals with the reader.  On the other alternating chapters, Christopher develops the mystery and his current discoveries.  <BR> Christophers search for information behind the dogs murder leads him to Mrs. Alexander, the elderly neighbor.  Concerned and confused by Christophers inquiries, Mrs. Alexander reveals why Christophers father doesnt get along with the Shears family.  Your mother, before she died, was very good friends with Mr. ShearsI mean they were very good friends.  Very, very good friends (60).  Christopher cannot comprehend the hint behind this; that his own father is being accused of murdering the Shears dog because his wife had an affair with Mr. Shears.  The story takes a twist when Chriss father admits the murder to Christopher after Chris stumbles upon letters from his motherwho turns out not to be dead.  Then I stopped reading the letter because I felt sick.  Mother had not had a heart attack.  Mother had not died.  Mother had been alive all the time.  And Father had lied about this (112).  With and unbearable guilt and broken words, Christophers father tries to justify his actions and admits to killing Wellington.  Christopher, though, could not understand his fathers painful emotions, and could only focus on the events at hand.  I had to get out of the house.  Father had murdered Wellington.  That meant he could murder me,because I couldnt trust him, even though he had said Trust me, because he had told a lie about a big thing (122).  Throughout these developments, Christopher doesnt analyze anything from an emotional point of view.  His voice remains informational and distant.  At points, he simply separates himself from reality, People say the Orion is called Orion because Orion was a hunter and the constellation looks like a hunter with a club and a bow and arrowbut this is really silly because it is just stars, and you could join up the dots in any way you wanted (125). Christopher escapes from his father by traveling through subways to get to his mother in London.  The terrifying journey brings Christopher to the edge of his limits.  Unable to handle new places, situations, and people with any success, Christopher struggles for a day and a half to work his way to his mothers apartment.  He barks at pedestrians, covers his ears, rocks back and forth, does maths in his head, and draws maps to keep his calm.  With his arrival, he finds his mother living with Mr. Shears.  Unable to comprehend the meaning behind this arrangement, he simply takes it for face value.  Trouble starts again when Chriss father comes by the same night to pick up Christopher.  He finds himself facing Mr. Shears, and being rejected by his son.  In the following days, Chriss mother accommodates for Christophers arrival, and makes plans to move to Swindon (where Chriss father lives), so Christopher can complete his maths A level.<BR> What began as a simple murder mystery blows up into a life changing story for Christopher.  Not only does he learn the truths behind the dogs murder and his mother, Christopher learns about himself and reveals to the reader that he wants to become a scientist.  And I know I can do this because I went to London on my own, and because I solved the mystery of Who Killed Wellington? and I found my mother and I was brave and I wrotea book and that means I can do anything (221).  The informational nature of Christophers autism doesnt make for a deep and meaningful book.  The reader will find a lack of emotion and understanding behind most situations in the novel.  It is possible, though, to find meaning in the story by putting yourself in the shoes of Christophers father or mother. A deep respect for the patience and understanding of those who fill Christophers life is developed in the reader.  Ironically, this same patience is needed to read through the novel.  The useless information and tangents of Christophers thoughts can be distracting and annoying, but are none-the-less part of an autistic mind.  By the end of the novel, Mark Haddon has wonderfully captured the autistic thought process.  If its nothing much to analyze and discuss, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is wonderful for understanding a condition that would otherwise confuse and annoy most of us.
B000051Y0G|3.0|If anybody has the song list for this CD, would you please post it?  Thanks!
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash is almost suprisingly categorized as &quot;country&quot; - maybe the term &quot;country&quot; meant something very different in the 1960s than it does today, but listening from the perspective of the 21st century, Johnny Cash's music sounds closer to folk or rockabilly than country. The backing music is typically very simple, the vocals pounding and ominous. The combined effect is mesmerizing and powerful, though the tools seem so simple and stark.<br />I came to this CD not knowing much about Johnny Cash, except that my parents listened to him (which I guess should scare me) and the songs &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, and &quot;Daddy Sang Bass&quot; were uninendelibly scraped on my conscious. With Cash's recent passing on, his music returned to me after years, so I found myself digging through the &quot;country&quot; section at CD stores. Cash's ouevre is very intriguing, especially his prison albums. This CD contains most of his best known songs performed in front of about 1000 high-security inmates at San Quentin prison. The energy is almost stifling, and Cash plays the crowd almost effortlessly and defiantly. In many cases he seems to be challenging the guards and the very walls of the prison itself. The song &quot;San Quentin&quot; was written from the perspective of an inmate, and is not very complimentary towards the institution.  The audience inevitably responds with awe and constant yelling and hooting and demands that the song be repeated, which it is, with just about as much yelling and hooting as the first take. The defiance of Cash and the mood of the audience carry the almost unnerving tension of an impending prison riot. One wonders what the guards must have been thinking as the fever of the crowd grew.<br />It's hard for me to compare this CD with the original record, having never heard it, but for those who have heard it, listening to this CD must be a completely different experience. A facsimilie of the original LP rear cover is included in the CD booklet. Only 10 songs are listed here, and the song order is dizzingly jumbled from the CD order. Many great songs were left off the original LP (including a GREAT version of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; where the backing vocalists mime the trumpet line brilliantly).<br />One interesting moment of the concert is before the song &quot;Wanted Man&quot;. Cash mentions Bob Dylan, and the crowd is absolutely silent. This seems strange since the year is 1969 and Dylan is still on top of his game (though he was then confusing his fans with albums like &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; on which Cash sang a duet with Dylan).<br />For newcomers to Johnny Cash, this CD makes for an interesting introduction to his music. A greatest hits album has less of Cash's personality on it than one of his live albums. This particular CD bristles with Cash's personality and persona. It's hard not to get hooked after giving this one a few listens.LP rear cover is included in the CD booklet. Only 10 songs are listed here, and the song order is dizzingly jumbled from the CD order.

B000068OSK|5.0|This, thier first album, is the best I have heard so far (I haven't listened to DJ Stijl yet).  Cannon has some o the bewst guitar work I have heard in a while.  This album really shows off their roots, especially their execellent cover of &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; by Bob Dylan.  There are a few odd ones, such as Little People, Astro (love that song!), and St. James Infermery, but overall I think that this is a very good album, and anyone who likes the blues should like this album.
B00005JM02|5.0|When Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks) loses his wife and most of his children to a hungry barracuda, he swears to protect the remaining child, Nemo, so that nothing ever happens to him.  When Nemo is finally old enough for school, Marlin has a hard time letting go and embarrasses Nemo in front of his friends, spurring Nemo to go and touch a boat close to the reef.  Before Marlin can chew Nemo out for disobeying him, Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and taken away.  Marlin tries to follow the boat, but quickly loses it and is forced to rely on a fish named Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss, to show him where it went.  Meanwhile, Nemo is learning all about dentistry in his new home in an aquarium in a fish tank in Sydney.  As Nemo tries to help the other fish escape back to the ocean, Marlin must overcome his fears and fight his way past hungry sharks, fearsome fish in deep trenches, stinging jellyfish, whales, pelicans and stupid seagulls.  Along the way, Marlin will come to learn the value of friendship and that, if you protect your children from everything, they will never get to experience anything - good or bad....<br />I would have to say that this is my favorite Pixar film yet.  I laughed my way through the whole movie and still laugh everytime I see it.  Dory was by far my favorite character, (her short-term memory loss makes her absolutely hilarious!) but Pixar took the time to study and make all of the characters memorable.  I am always impressed by their attention to detail and simple, yet meaningful plots.  This is one of those rare films that both adults and children of all ages can truly enjoy.  However, I would like to say that children of the ages of 3 and under sometimes get really scared while they are watching this film, as there are some dark scenes and sudden movements by the monster fish.  Still, I would say that this one is definitely a buy for anyone - I am 27 and it is one of my favorites!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|This CD is a masterpiece. The music is excellent, the lyrics are excellent and full of meaning and the execution is excellent. This CD is a classic that no fan of music should be without. The album art and cover are even great. Testify and Guerilla Radio both have great lyrics and politically charged lyrics that will leave you stunned. Those two songs are truely amazing. Maria is also an awesome song about illeagal immigration (among other things). Zach's lyrics are meaningful and show his beliefs and thoughts. Rage's final &quot;real&quot; (with all original songs) is an amazing piece of art.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) had a plan for success - open a bicycle shop in a nice town and watch the money come rolling in.  Unfortunately, Charles didn't do so well at selling bikes, but he found that he had a gift for selling the new automobiles.  Before long, he was a very wealthy man, even after the stock market crashed, plunging most people into poverty during the Great Depression.  Charles kept selling cars and doting on his only child, a son that was his whole world.  When his son died in a freak car accident, Charles locked up all of his cars, endured a messy divorce, and headed down to Mexico, where he met a young woman who made him start living again.  She convinced him that horses were still needed and loved in society and before Charles knew it, he was in the horse racing business with a small horse that had never won a race before...Seabiscuit.<br />Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) grew up with a natural affinity for horses and a love for the literature that his father taught.  His was a tight-knit, loving family that was torn apart during the Great Depression.  When Red's father discovered that his son could make money with horses, he gave him up to a wealthy man so that he could have a chance at a decent life.  Red never saw his family again.  As he grew older, Red struggled to keep his weight down so that he could jockey, but after a series of failures, he got involved in boxing and drinking, leaving him down on his luck and penniless in Mexico, where a friend introduced him to Charles...<br />Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was a master horseman who excelled at training any and every horse that ever crossed his path, but his ways of horse training were viewed as obsolete and too time consuming.  He was homeless, living off the land in Mexico, when someone recommended him to Charles and Charles hired him.  Now all of the major players were in place and they were trying to do the impossible - get a horse that was too small, who had been bred for defeat, who was ridden by a jockey that was too big who couldn't see to beat one of the most famous racehorses of all time...<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and felt that it was very inspirational.  It is true that the director stayed a little too focused on portraying the story in the way that Hilldebrand's book told it, but it was very well done nonetheless.  The pacing is a little bit off as the director takes the time to fill in background information about the Great Depression and each of the major characters, but that also made every victory all the more poignant and meaningful (it is also a very tricky way of getting people who claim that they hate history to learn something while watching a movie!).  The cinematography was gorgeous, the score was lush and beautiful, the characters were very ably cast and the story is extremely inspiring.  If you are looking for a lovely drama that has a good moral and is well made, look no further than Seabiscuit.s ridden by a jockey that was too big who couldn't see to beat one of the most famous racehorses of all time...<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and felt that it was very inspirational.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|There are artists whose catchy songs you like the beat of, ones whose voices click with you (and you don't care what the message is, as long as their voice is ringing), ones whose words touch you, and then there are artists like Sarah McLachlan, who for me encompasses all of the above and more. There are few artists that make me stop &amp; wonder, &quot;what is this person FEELING and THINKING? WHERE does this song come from, etc.<br />With Afterglow, honestly, there are a few songs that don't touch me, but like her other works, there are a few that immediately reached out, and others that took a while to find me searching them out.<br />Fallen was an obvious jump-out-at-me song, as was Train Wreck. Time is probably the one I hit repeat the most on right now. Stupid was one that took some getting into. Drifting &amp; Perfect Girl are moving up on my list too.<br />All in all, I'd say it was money VERY well spent, and I applaud Sarah's continued ability to dive deep inside herself, wrangle with what wants to come out and what needs coaxing to break the surface. Her voice is soothing, comforting, but in an &quot;I've been there, and I feel your pain&quot; kind of way.<br />She continues to be one of my favorite artists.<br />In my opinion, Afterglow's on par with Surfacing, which I liked a little more than Fumbling.<br />Sarah, thank you.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Neo (Keanu Reeves) is still trying to come to terms with being The One, the person who will save Zion and bring an end to the war with the machines.  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) firmly believes in the Prophecy and does his utmost to convince the Council and everyone else in Zion that Neo can accomplish this task, but Neo is not so sure that he can.  The Oracle keeps telling him what he will do and what will happen and Neo does not like to think that his life has already been decided - what happened to his own say in his life?  Still, Neo knows that he has other people to think about so he tries to follow the Oracle's advice.  She tells him that he must rescue the Keymaker so that the Keymaker can get Neo into The Source, where he will meet with the Architect, the person who created the Matrix.  The only problem is, the Keymaker is held prisoner by a powerful program who does not want to let him go...<br />This movie wasn't as good as The Matrix, but it was still a very good movie.  It had me on the edge of my seat almost the whole time and left me hanging at the end so I was frantic to see the third film.  The reason why it was not as good was simply that the surprise factor was gone - I knew that the special effects would be amazing and the fighting sequences would be brilliant and, funnily enough, they were, but I knew that they would be before I saw the movie so, no matter how spectacular they were, I felt that I had seen them in the first film.  Still, the Wachowski brothers did a fabulous job with the 'Burly Brawl' scene and I loved meeting other programs in the Matrix, they were just like really wealthy, snooty people that you really wanted to take down a peg or two.  Of course, the freeway chase sequence was spectacular and, personally, I thought that it was worth watching the whole film just to see that, but that is just my opinion.  If you enjoy science fiction or action/thrillers, then I am confident that you will enjoy this film also.
B00005JLEU|1.0|This is, by far, one of the creepiest movies that I've ever managed to actually sit through.  I love anime, but can't quite understand why this one has become quite so popular.  The backline (with family) is a great story, but the whole spirit storyline gets very farfetched and downright creepy.  This could cause nightmares in children and adults.
0446310786|3.0|This is a pretty good book. The plot isn't that bad. It would have been much better if the author had left race out of the book. I like court cases and books about them, but I don't really care too much when the moral of the story is &quot;don't be racist.&quot; We've come far enough, there is very little racism out there. High school students should get to read contemporary fiction, things that apply to us now-adays, not about racism that only a small minority feel now-adays. Besides, black people are more racist than whites in this day and age.
0590259385|5.0|My young daughters (now 3 and 7) dearly love this book.  We have it memorized.  It is sweet and the illustrations are beautiful.  It is one of the few young books that I never get bored of reading.  It is definitely a classic children's book.
0783225857|1.0|I like black and white movies sometimes, but the quality of this movie sucks.  Extremely long and boring.... I would hate to watch it again!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd just like to say up front that I'd never seen an episode of Buffy or Angel before Firefly came on, and considered the whole craze kind of, well, crazy. Firefly gave me so much respect for the work of Joss Whedon, however, that I decided to go back and give the other series a chance. They're quirky and enjoyable enough, but don't hit their stride so quickly or as well as Firefly did in my opinion.<br />As for this particular series, I saw a preview of it in a TV Guide article and thought it looked interesting, especially since I've seen similar shows such as Cowboy Bebop. I was shocked by how much these characters and episodes were able to move me, particularly in episodes such as Out of Gas, where we see exactly what Captain Mal Reynolds feels and remembers about his ship and his crew. I've heard only a few negative reviews of the series, mostly people who couldn't grasp Firefly's concept for the future. Whether it was a lack of aliens or understanding of the cultural integration and western/colonial influences, I don't think it's possible to like this kind of series if you can't understand it. (Nor should we as fans berate those at Fox that can't or won't ever understand it.)<br />A movie and soundtrack are currently under production at this time, and I'm excited for both. I just hope for the day when an exec at Fox goes to Joss and says, &quot;Boy, your movie was sure successful at the box office. Have you ever thought about turning it into a TV series?&quot;
6300189473|5.0|I think Santa Claus the Movie is one of the best Christmas films ever made and it's a shame that they have deleted this film from the UK shops.  It has a great overview of how you should feel over the Christmas period and is entertaining for both children and adults.  If you have not seen this film yet it is a must and a film that can be watched over and over again with out becoming tedious!!!  It convinced me that Santa really lives in the North Pole???????
0375420525|5.0|Yes, there's a few dry spots -- there's a few nutty supots (backwards text, text with strikethroughs etc.) but dont give up on it.  Finish it, force yourself to.  In 50 years this book will be one of 2 things: 1) Looked upon like Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet or 2) Be banned all throughout the United States and Britian with government organized book burnings.  Let's hope that its number 1.  Everyone should read this book...give it a chance...its so original, so fresh, its just a great book!

B00009W0U4|5.0|Irreversible is French director Gaspar No&eacute;'s second feature film, after the mildly successful \\"I stand alone\\", released in 1998.  Irreversible premiered last year at the Cannes film festival and quickly gained a cult reputation as a film that had packs of people exiting the theatre in the middle of the presentation in a state of shock.  As a person well versed in shock cinema I have sadly become desensitized to a lot of on-screen violence but once in a while a film will come along that will shock me.  Irreversible did more than just shock me, it sickened me.  There were a couple of scenes in this film that had me choking back bile, looking away from my T.V. set and thankful that I was watching it alone and hadn't subjected anyone else into viewing this orgy of violence with me.<br />The entire film rolls in reverse order, starting with the ending credits.  The next 20 minutes show us an uptight guy named Marcus and his friend Pierre enter a gay brothel in search of \\"Le T&eacute;nia\\", a pimp who raped Marcus' girlfriend Alex.  As the movie unfolds in reverse order, we see the events that lead up to Alex's rape and the tight friendship that the three have.<br />The first half hour of the film is a very taxing experience on the viewer.  The camera constantly spins, turns and twists in every imaginable direction.  Anyone prone to seasickness or headaches might find this to be very unpleasant.  Not to mention the pounding score that never lets up and pretty much muffles any dialogue on screen.  Fluent in French, I fully intended to watch the film in its original version, however the constant noise of the industrial-tinged score and booming nightclub music makes it nearly impossible to make out what the characters are saying and I had to resort to switching on the English subtitles.  After the first 30 minutes (which are the climax of the events since the film plays backwards) things slow down a bit and the shifting camera and loud noise finally let up, until of course No&eacute; subjects the viewer to an absolutely horrific 9-minute rape sequence.  It is easily the most shocking scene of its type that I've ever seen and it's the way it's presented to us that makes it all the more shocking.  The camera never shifts, there's no ominous music, just the horrible cries of anguish of the helpless victim.  This rape sequence and a gruesome death scene involving someone getting bashed in the head with a fire extinguisher 20+ times are really the only major shockers of the movie but they are such intense scenes that it is no wonder so many people at Cannes walked out on the movie.<br />Once the movie ended, I couldn't help but restart the movie right away and watch the first half hour again.  The first time I saw these climactic scenes I felt somewhat indifferent as I didn't even know the characters yet.  But I knew I'd see it in a very different light the second time around.  Not since Memento had a film made me want to re-watch a major portion of the film immediately after the initial viewing.  As I flicked off my T.V. set I felt disturbed but also at the same time felt like I had witnessed a truly creative piece of filmmaking by an upcoming maverick filmmaker that would have a lasting effect on me.  Irreversible plays like an urban and intellectual art house version of \\"I spit on your grave\\", an all-out assault on the senses that pummeled me into submission during its mercifully short 90 minutes.  It is shocking, sickening and at times thoroughly unpleasant. It is also one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. subjects the viewer to an absolutely horrific 9-minute rape sequence.

B000001FKY|5.0|Even better than Pyromania, Hysteria is clearly the best Def Leppard album and the greatest rock album of the 80's, maybe the the best ever. AMG calls this album a masterpiece and I totally agree. All 12 songs are great. Every song could have been a Top 40 hit. Just when you think you've found a weak song on this album, it suddenly becomes one of your favorites after a few listens. No other album I own has such lasting replay value. Everyone who hears this album loves it. &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; was topping the charts in 1989 almost 2 years after this albums release. I believe it set a record for the number of weeks on the charts. The songs are catchy, uplifting, have a lot of feeling to them and are brilliantly recorded. The production is absoluetly flawless. Rick Allen's performance on the drums after losing an arm in a car wreck just after the Pyromania tour even makes this album more special and significant. If you appreciate good hard rock, you have got to have this gem in your collection.
0385504209|3.0|Most of the story in The Da Vinci Code is really a framing tale telling the story of the Christian Church, from blackmail, lies, and murders, up to and including devotion, faith, and love.<br />The subject matter of The Da Vinci Code is very interesting, and information on the Grail, Da Vinci, the Knights Templar, Mary Magdelene, the Louvre, etc, is presented in such a way as to make the reader want to learn more about them.<br />While the book is entertaining and thought-provoking, Brown's writing style seems more likely to fit in with the Young Adult section than the Literature section. First, he writes many scenes as though he's doing treatments for a movie. Second, there is hardly any suspense from about halfway through the book, although Brown tries his best to make you believe there is. You know exactly who's done what 40 pages before Brown reveals it, because Brown pretty much beats you over the head with hints.<br />Let's face it: The Da Vinci Code is not the Book of Revelations. But having said that, it was definitely interesting, and I'm happy I read it.
0316666343|5.0|I spent the week reading this book and finished it tonight.  I only have a small amount of time each day to read or I probably would have finished it in a day - I didn't want to put it down. <br />All week, I have felt weepy and have gone about my daily business with a lump in my throat!  The book was so sad, but so well written.  <br />I'm almost relieved to be done reading it.  Now I need to go have a good cry!
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|This cd is fantastic! It has most of  the songs by Peter Gabriel that I love, such as 'Big time', 'Sledgehammer', 'I grieve', 'Lovetown', 'Game without frontiers' and 'Red rain' to name a few. The hits span his career from 1977 to 2003 with 2 new tracks included.<br /><br />It also has fantastic songs I have never heard before like 'Cloudless', which is performed without words, just humming and chanting to a dreamy soundscape. Brilliant!!! Other standouts are 'More than this', 'Downside up', and 'Burn you up, burn you down', the last 2 tracks being new recordings.<br /><br />The man's talent is simply phenomenal! Get this cd. Now I really must go, I've got the rest of PG's CDs to collect...
B0000DBJ2B|5.0|To the person complaining about being too cheap to hire actors... first off, it took you FIVE MINUTES to realize they were puppets??? I can't believe it took you that long. It was never intended to be a conspiracy that they were puppets. I bet anime pissed you off after (5 minutes into it) you noticed the &quot;actors&quot; were drawn. I can just imagine how pissed you were when you noticed (taking probably at least 30 minutes this time) the &quot;actors&quot; in Final Fantasy were CG. I mean, are these people out to deceive the world with their fake actors??? Who the hell do they think they are??!!! :rolleyes:<br />Anyways, this is one of the favorites from my childhood, so I'm more than a little jaded about it. That being said though, I do still watch this while there are many other movies I used to watch as a child that I can't without bursting in to fits of laughter. <br />Pretty much if you liked any or all of these, you'll like this movie: Secret of NIMH, Legend, Labrynth. Especially Labrynth of course.<br />One of those movies you can feel good about letting your kid watch (and you can enjoy too), as it won't rot out his/her brain like so many other movies geared towards children.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|A masterpiece, superior to its predecessor which, don't get me wrong was very good.<br /><br />There is a relaxed, breezy feel to the whole cd, and the songs catch you instantly. The lead off single 'You don't know my name' is a brilliant song (co penned with Kanye West), reminiscent of classic 70s soul, complete with a spoken word section. In fact, the whole cd sounds like classics from the 70s, amazing to find that all but one of the songs are penned or co penned by Keys.<br /><br />On 'If I aint got you', 'If I was your woman' (an excellent remake by the way) and 'When you really love someone', she sings with a raspy growl seeping with passion, akin to Mary J bilge.<br /><br />Shock horror on seeing her work with Timbaaland (don't get me wrong, I love Timbaaland, but didn't think his futuristic funk would fit Alicia's smooth retro soul), but the result is the lovely retro funk of 'Heartburn'. All she needs now is an afro.<br /><br />'So simple' is simply fab and is my favourite, with delicate piano tinklings sprinkled throughout. 'Dragon days' is a corker, 'Diary', 'Samsonite man', the lovely interlude 'Feeling U, feeling me', and the jazzy 'Nobody, not really' are superb.<br /><br />Another good point, averaging 4 minutes, no song overstays its welcome (exception, 'You don't know my name' which needs all of its 6 minutes 6 seconds to weave its magic).<br /><br />There were few soul cds released in 2003 which can dream of coming close to this soon-to-be-classic. Awesome!!!
B0000039QA|5.0|you need this huge double disc classic not one bad song on this cd other reviewers who hated on this disc i hope u burn in hell r.i.p. skys the limit go get it!!!!!<br />10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats
B000008DA5|5.0|Despite the whole debacle (which in recent years turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Brian Wilson) of the Smile album, Brian still created a very unique sounding album without even trying. <br />This album was recorded in only 3 weeks, and it's brilliant. It was recorded at Brian's newly built home studio, and everything sounds really organic, and demo quality (which people hate about it, but i love that about it). The piano and organ are very eerie sounding, and the band naturally experiments together as a group the first time in years. The group harmonys are still amazingly gorgeous.<br />People try to make the mistake that this is supposed to replace Smile, but if you forget the whole circumstances towards which this album was recorded, whether this was just a contractual obligation or not, you'll find Brian created some of the weirdest, druggiest, psyched out songs of his career. Sometimes even more messed up then the stuff he was recording on Smile. If this was any other band, or if Brian happened to release this without all of that overblown hype that killed Brian's motivation, more people would understand the greatness of this album.<br />I have a different opinion than most people in that i'm glad this album was recorded. It's sad that Brian declined after Smile, and eventually got worse psychologically, but this album has an awesome sound which can be closely described as the aftermath of a shipwreck. The boys sound sad on here, and it gives the album this ultra spiritual (though sometimes it gets scary, maybe even disturbing) and beautiful quality. I think it'd be perfect music for during a funeral. Some people don't like that about it, but that's the main charm of the record for me.<br />&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; sticks out like a sore thumb on the record, but it's an amazing song and one of the highlights on here so we can forgive that. &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot; is the other main highlight, and in some ways is even more brilliant than &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. I think THIS single version is the definitive version and not the Smile version. The Smile version only works in context of Smile, this version is the perfect one to release out of context as a single. Works wonderfully within Smiley Smile too, although a bit more produced.<br />That's all anyone would usually buy this album for, those 2 singles. But there's more! &quot;Fall Breaks And Back To Winter&quot; is a brilliant mood piece, made years before mood pieces became more known as a genre. It's plenty weird, and it's great to hear Brian do stuff like this, 2 years after the cheerful innocent &quot;California Girls&quot;. &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot; is also weird, playin' like a psychadelic 50's tune, mixed with some latin influence in the first part. Most people only mention about 16 second intro when they talk about &quot;Little Pad&quot;. Why's that? The rest of the song is gorgeous! It's like a spiritual hawaiian song. The intro is weird, with the boys all stoned and giggly over the voice track of an incomplete piano/voice version of the song, but that's only 16 seconds out of 2:33. And it's interesting anyways, so who cares? &quot;With Me Tonight&quot; is beautiful, with awesome group vocals again and an emotional quality through the whole thing, &quot;Gettin' Hungry&quot; is very very unique. Weird all the same, but you've never heard that weird mix of bass heavy hammond organ and woodblocks before. The verses are just as weird, with the only instrument playing is a bass and an echoy fingertapping electric guitar over Mike and Brian's (hilariously over enthusastic) vocals. It's an awesome song, though we can see why it didn't chart as a single. And &quot;Whistle In&quot; is very catchy, has a great melody and great Carl vocal.<br />As for the Smile songs (besides &quot;Heroes And Villians, and the other suspectedly Smile tunes), i don't see them as inferior to the SMile tracks, i see them as different creations forgetting that Smileeven existed. &quot;Vegetables&quot;, &quot;Wonderful&quot;, and &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; are very creepy, beautiful, spiritual, and along with the rest of the album show why indie rockers or modern psychadelia fans love this album. You just never heard songs like this on any other album, so in a sense, that's where Beach Boys beat The Beatles. You can't hear anyone imitate the bands sound and succeed at imitating.<br />So this is really one of my personal favorite Beach Boys albums. From Pet Sounds till Friends is my favorite Beach Boys period ever. I recommend this album to anyone who is willing to listen to this as a classic psyched out psychadelia album away from the Smile stuff, especially if they like albums like Big Star's Third or Syd Barrett's Madcap Laughs. Both are similar in ways (&quot;Holocaust&quot; by Big Star sorta reminds me of Smiley Smile).
0142004235|3.0|this here book about the virtues of man and the contrast of good and evil as paralled through characters better known as \\"Adam and Eve\\" is good, but not as good as one we all know as \\"West of Hell\\" and that is the bible! Stieinbeck is the debil!
0425170349|4.0|This novel was pretty good, the tactics and charcters were right on with Clancy. I liked seeing Clark again, and the events as told were pretty close to real world events. But their were times where it got to be a bit downer. All in All a pretty good book.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yeah, that's right! If the reviewer rates the CD five stars, then let all the Britney haters say that the review wasn't useful and if the reviwer gives it one star, let the Britney haters vote for it as useful! Interesting game to be playing at a place where one would normally look for reviews to help them buy the CD...<BR>To whoever says that In the Zone isn't music, what is your defination of music then?? It has hip hop, pop and rnb. The beats and tunes extend from Southern to pure club to Chinese to Indian to 60s/70s atmostphere to pure hiphop beats to normal ballad tunes. Have any of the one-star reviewers listened to the CD at least twice?? This is definately music. Get your ears checked or make sure you have the right CD in your player if you don't think so.  I mean if voice was everything why isn't Celine Dion doing this well?? She's pretty too. There are a million people in the world who have great voices and probably better looking than Britney but are they all singers??? My point is voice doesn't have to define an artist. The style does. Britney has got a great style to her music and hot beats and tunes. Her lyrics aren't too impressive but it's for people who wanna have some fun. <BR>Every song on this CD is good and so different. You must buy it. If you just wanna find satisfaction in writing one-star reviews here without listening to the CD, save your dough to get popcorn while you do so. Others, who are interested in some pure good fun music, get it now!
0385043805|5.0|The librarian suggested this book for me becasue I had told her I needed some reading that actually stimulated my thought process. And  Rebecca was perfect. With the whole book set up like one big flashback, it keeps you wondering what happens next. Daphne du Maurier excellently uses foreshadowing to keep the reader in suspense as she follows the lives of Maxim de Winter and his second wife. It is literally bone chilling, and when the book is all over, the reader is left with a feeling that they lived through the book's main events alongside Mrs. de Winter. I would highly recommend this book.
080726203X|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" gave me a new perspective on how I view life. After reading this novel I began to relize how often we as people take our daily lives and activites for granted. \\"The Giver\\" is such an originally written novel by Lowis Lowry, it's complex, but understanding and creative all at the same time. I was engrossed in the novel and all the events that took place; I could some what relate to the characters and how they sometimes felt. \\"The Giver\\" is an \\"A\\" class novel and one of my all time favorites, any one who enjoys reading will definatly enjoy reading \\"The Giver\\".
B00005LQ04|5.0|i collect therefore i am! a classic, a must have , even if you havent seen it buy it!!!!11
B00009V7T2|5.0|I havent heard such a good album in a long while. Good stuff, what more can I say. Besides you can spare a few bucks, right? It's totally worth it.
B000093BDX|5.0|i bought this and it was great i felt like a little girl again back in the 80's with the bad hair and embarassing outfits... this ALBUM is a MUST BUY!
B00006LIRI|1.0|This collection is so incredibly lousy that I can't even approach this disc without knowingin how badly developed this set is.<br /> The new mixes of the singles from &quot;Pop&quot; absolutely stink! I don't like &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; either.<br /> U2 are a great band but this second hits CD from them just fails on all fronts. Avoid at all costs and get their albums instead.
0316776963|5.0|I've read this book twice, and it was even funnier the second time. Sedaris has had very interesting and amusing life experiences, and he's more than willing to share these with us.  As a chain-smoking, lisping homosexual in a country that has banned smoking for the most part and often detests gay men with \\"effeminate\\" characteristics, Sedaris is unabashed and certainly not regretful.  <br />He shares his experiences of his quirky family that includes his sister Amy Sedaris, former star of \\"Strangers with Candy\\" and his rotten-fruit-eating father. He recounts his struggles with a speech therapist who attempts to correct his lisping (the apparently obvious mark of homosexuality) and his brilliant tactics to avoid its correction.  Many of his stories are taken from his time in France where he lived with his boyfriend Hugh.  These stories successfully convey both the difficulties and joys of living the expatriate life - appreciating a new culture, learning a new language, and viewing American tourists in a new and often all too revealing light.<br />The best of his stories, in my opinion, unleashes onto us his younger brother, a foul-mouthed, gangster rap fan who is a stark contrast to his father but is his most dependable support.  This particular story really demonstrates what Sedaris is capable of.  It's incredibly funny but so poignant at the same time.<br />This book will make you laugh at loud, and I hope you get a chance to read it.  Make sure you check out \\"Naked\\" also for more of Sedaris' brilliance.
0316666343|5.0|It's not a murder mystery or a thriller - so if you're expecting that you'll be disappointed.  Rather, it's a story that follows the simple struggle of a family as they cope with a tragic loss.  As \\"Susie\\" tells the story from her \\"Heaven\\", she also works through the loss of a life she will never get to live.    The story is well-written and compelling, and although there is a message of hope hidden in there somewhere, it never quite compensates for the sad nature of the story.      So if you want a somewhat typical crime drama, where the bad guy finally is gunned-down in a hail of righteous violence and all of the loose ends are tied up and no psychological scars remain - this isn't the book for you.  But if you'd like a well-written, more true to life exploration of the after effects of a terrible crime, told from an interesting perspective and with a few twists - then you'll enjoy this one.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|If you go to the website there is a song that plays at first I was wondering what the song was and if it was on the cd. Also if you click luicy lui or oren ishii the music plays again. Its a simple guitar line but i was curious to know if the full song was on the cd. thank you.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|It's amazing that Britney Spears continues to make so called &quot;music&quot;. She has no talent, she can't sing. Yes she can dance, but that's not enough to save her. She is an empire, and there are very smart people that keep her in the public eye, which helps her get attention and the constant talk around the water cooler each day. But when it comes down to the music, what is there? Nothing. There is absolutely no substance on this album. This isn't real music, can you honestly hear any real instruments on the album? No because its all synthesized and overproduced. Anyone could have made this album, and a lot of people could have made this a better album than she did. She wants to show she's all provocative and edgy, but she's not. Every album she has this new image, and she completely contradicts herself. Honey, concentrate on making real music that means something, cause this is nothing but a mess.
B00006AW2G|5.0|When I heard &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; I was hooked, that song just blows me away every time I hear it... greatest white blues song ever recorded... This CD is timeless, you can listen to it over and over and it never gets old...My personal favorite of all there CDs....Doesnt get any better than this.....
B000001IPL|5.0|Now this is what I call real punk, there are hardly any more bands out there that could make themselves sound like this. Yup, The Offspring has truly demonstrated what punk really is, and it's all on this record(and Ignition and the self-titled debut album).<BR>There isn't a song I didn't like on this record, it all kicks ass! Tracks that standout include &quot;Nitro&quot;, with a cool drum roll at the beginning, &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; and &quot;Self Esteem&quot;, it may sound very different from their more future records, but it still doesn't disappoint me. &quot;Bad Habit&quot; featured a really cool bassline at the beginning, then it slowly builds up with some guitar and vocals, then suddenly it throws you into full volume. One drawback is that the bass could'nt really be heard, so the treble is too strong and really hurts your ears.<BR>Same as &quot;Ignition&quot;, they do not sound completely polished, but that's when they were still getting started into the music industry, their work only gets better with time and experience.<br />Anyway, to sum up, this cd demonstrates what punk is supposed to be and I recommend to all you punk lovers. Go for it!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|What a great show, \\"Isnt it a pity\\" was so nice, Billy Preston has such a nice voice...what a jam...Tom Petty did a wonderful job on \\"Taxman\\" and \\"I need you\\"....who is Tom Brown??? he did a very nice rendition of \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", Sam Brown really rocked the house...she was awesome. Of course Georges old band mates Sir Paul and Ringo were great too.... verey nicely done by all performers....George would have been proud,,,, Dahni is a dead ringer for his father....HIGHLY RECOMMENEDED!!!!!
B0000C8AW7|2.0|The critics loved this CD, but they're probably the same ones who keep voting the now tired sounding Sgt. Peppers record the greatest thing ever recorded. This is Dylan trying to sound like Bob Dylan 60s revisted. Despite his tremendous talent, Dylan can't carry it off. The CD mainly recycles his old ideas and music. It isn't bad, but it is not very compelling or convincing.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|I usually don't buy many cd's but when I heard You Make Me Feel Brand New,(saw him on tv)had to get it,also didn't know sunrise was by him.I love his voice and the cd.Easy listening.
B000053VAZ|1.0|An art-nazi tour de force. Hideously cute. Avoid it at all costs unless you enjoy saccharine humor and sensitivity. I guess it could be useful in stirring the souls of the emotionally dead into feeling a new form of nothing.
0060922583|3.0|Yes, this book is an interesting and enjoyable read. And it will expand your horizons and make you think differently. But this comes at the price of plausibility.<br />The book is centred aroud the theory that our universe is a hologram. The physics (largely at a quantum level) is explained well, as are the implications. These are divided into explaining unusual happenings to the mind and body as well as space and time.<br />The problem is that the book, while not a New Age text as such, gives too much credence to events that aren't generally accepted in the scientific community. And when a book relates itself to the scientific method, it can't then go on to describe how the hologram theory explains miracles, almost taking their existence for granted.<br />With a grain of salt however, it's delves into a very interesting question: what if everything (matter, space, time) is like a hologram - transient, malleable and self-contained? An enojoyable question to answer.
B000003S5H|5.0|Moon Safari is not an album with specific songs that stand out (i.e. where you can just press the repeat button and listen to that one song).  Holistically, Moon Safari stands out. Every song is perfectly composed by the French duo that leads to a very laid back driving-in-a-desert-on-a-Sunday-morning milieu.  It has class, rhythm and replayability.
B00007LTIA|5.0|this isn't really a review, it's just a response to the below review. why review it again if you don't like it? just wondering..
B000055ZDT|5.0|If you are looking for only 1 heavy release this year, get this one. The rest are retarded. Except maybe Eyehategod.
B00005OWEG|5.0|When I watched the original movie 20 years ago I was <BR>very impressed (for all the wrong reasons like Duvall's swaggering Kilgore).<BR> Watching the additional footage in Redux,<BR>I can say I had no idea then what this movie is about, or<BR>it's literary complexities. The Plantation scene is absolutely<BR>brilliant, fundamental to the Heart of Darkness book theme, also<BR>like the end scene where we see Kurtz's copy of the 'Golden Bough'.<br />It's so easy to sell the violent scenes to the movie audience, but you try to <BR>show a loving scene in the movie the critics will say 'its too drawn out' in <BR>the Plantation scene, or 'cheap' in the Bunny scene. That's the American <BR>psyche  still at work today, violence is embraced for over 3 hours, <BR>but 3 minutes of love is way too long. There is no elegance in violence<BR>but the movie love scene always has to be elegant<BR> (like some airbrushed Playboy perfection) , if not, it's tawdry and shameful<BR> to the movie critics.  <br />On a historical note, the film seems to blend the various War <BR>myths of Poshepny's Hmong army, II/47's operation at the Memot<BR>rubber plantation, and SOG's Operation Tailwind. Martin Sheen<BR>wonders aloud in Apocalpyse Now why they really want Kurtz dead.<br />When I saw the opium scene at the Plantation (US-backed<BR> Warlords ran drug operations near Memot in war time) it seems to me <BR>real-life military operations in the area were designed to keep the trade flourishing.<BR> If the CIA wanted control of the area, an<BR>out of control rogue like Kurtz (Poshepny?), had to go.
0385504209|1.0|I will have to qualify this review by stating that I have only read the first five chapters. I would have read more, but Brown's writing style is so inane and uncreative, I couldn't stop laughing.<br />Admittedly, it is quite difficult to refrain from snickering at such [paraphrased] gems like: &quot;He resembled Harrison Ford in a tweed jacket&quot;. Of the almost infinite possibilities in which one can describe a person, the author chose this actor's visage.<br />In my humble opinion, the novel is about par with &quot;See Spot Run&quot; or an English reading primer.
B0001906O0|5.0|This is the way to do it. A perfect collection by a perfect band.<br />While many bands like The Cure often release &quot;hits&quot; packages that cash in on stuff we already got, this one delivers what we really want: a substantial collection of songs (some more familiar than others) including covers, mixes and rarities that can be hard to find.<br />Few bands are worthy of buying their box sets, especially when enthusiasts have most of their stuff anyway.<br />This definitive collection is a shining exception to the rule.
0800179501|5.0|I often use &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; in class as an example of a &quot;put up or shut up scene.&quot;  This is something I made up, but the idea is that there is a moment when a movie is either going to work or not work.  The moment comes in this 1984 film when young Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio), who has come to Mr. Miyagi (Oscar nominee Noriyuki &quot;Pat&quot; Morita) to learn karate so he can defend himself from the neighborhood bullies.  But all the old man has had Daniel-san do is paint the fence, sand the floor, and wax the car.  Finally, the kid has had enough and in an unforgettable scene Mr. Miyagi shows him that all of the repetitive and seemingly meaningless motions he has been doing are actually the fundamental moves of karate.  For both Daniel-san and the audience, Mr. Miyagi puts all the pieces together and at the end when he tells Daniel &quot;Come back tomorrow,&quot; you know the kid will pick his jaw off the ground and be there.  The audience is hooked as well.<br />Scriptwriter Robert Mark Kamen gets a lot of credit for this scene; his first script had been &quot;Taps,&quot; and he would go on to write &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot; (no, the other one, with James Marshall Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  But credit also goes to Morita's performance in this scene (he lost the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor to Haing S. Ngor in &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;).  Familiar to television views as Captain Sam Pak on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Arnold&quot; on &quot;Happy Days,&quot; Morita became another in a long line of &quot;comic&quot; actors who showed serious chops in a dramatic role.  You really get the sense that here is an actor who has been waiting his entire career for a scene this good and he absolutely nails it.<br />The movie certainly comes close to going over the top, but director John G. Avildsen, who helped write the book on the contemporary inspirational &quot;sports&quot; film when he won the Oscar for the original &quot;Rocky,&quot; keeps things on track.  Elisabeth Shue plays Daniel's girl in this 1984 film, which was the same year she did &quot;Call to Glory&quot; on the tube and became the cutest girl in creation for me that year.  There is always a romantic sub-plot in movies like this and I do not know about her, but he certainly shows extremely good tast in this film.<br />William Zabka was Johnny Lawrence, the &quot;bad&quot; kid Daniel has to beat in the big karate tournament, and the other very interesting character in this story.  This is because while he is the favored discipline of John Kreese (Martin Kove), the dark ying to Mr. Myagi's yang, we find out there are limits as to how low this kid will go.  My biggest disappointment with &quot;Karate Kid II&quot; is that in the opening scene, which shows the aftermath of the big match out in the parking lot, they lay out what would have been a pretty good sequel: Daniel-san and Mr. Myagi trying to get Johnny away from Kresse's destructive influences.  Think of all the peer pressure that would be on this kid.  It would have made a pretty good film.<br />&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; is not a great film, but it has a great scene and every time I see a movie that fumbles the big moment I think on this one.  The prime example at the other end of the spectrum for me is &quot;The Secret of My Success,&quot; where the big moment has Michael J. Fox's character talking to a bunch of high rollers.  If he can convince them his idea is great, things will happen.  But we never hear a word he says as the music becomes loud and inspirational.  I can only sadly shake my head and tell the screenwriter of that film, &quot;Come back tomorrow.&quot;&quot;Rocky,&quot; keeps things on track.

B000002J1U|5.0|The acoustic material contained in LZ III really proved that Zep had more musical depth and talent than the Stones, Clapton, Hendrix or the Who. But the real star of this show is 'Immigrant Song'. This song (along with 'Speed King', by Deep Purple) was the original speed metal anthem, and laid the foundation for all true metal and hard rock that was to follow.<BR>The song's structure gives rise to visions of a machine that pulsates and resonates in perfect mechanical harmony, even as it races forward at lightning speed. This tune also seemed to mark the end of the 'hippie' and 'peace/love/joy' era of 1965 -1969. A baser, faster and more brutal mindset began to take hold in the world in 1970, and this song is the perfect soundtrack for the technological/social upheavals that followed in the '70s and beyond.
B00005JMEW|5.0|One of the best directed movies ever has finally been put on DVD. The director is known for his crazy and cool shooting. This movie, only Tarintino's  4th, has been a true movie picture. It is a great story with lots of action and martial arts. Uma Thurman, who stars as the bride, does a spectacular job filling out her role in getting revenge. Uma has not been recognized too much except for her role in Pulp Fiction and some other movies but this one will change that. Again this is the best movie I have ever seen.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Now I have to admit to all of you children of the 80's....I was born in 1991. Althought most of my generation listens to what MTV and the dreaded Z1077 tell them to, and watches American Idol and horrible movies like &quot;bring it on&quot; I myself have chosen to be different. i listen to rock and roll and 80's music and my favorite movies are ones that most of them have never seen in their entire lives...that is until they interact with me...so This is my review for my all-time favorite movie besides &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;,....drumroll please....THE FABULOUS &quot;BREAKFAST CLUB!&quot; <BR>well for a brief overview of the plot there is the brain named Brian (Anthony Micheal Hall) the pretty popular girl Claire (Molly Ringwald), the rebel-metelhead-criminal guy, who happens to be my favorite of the bunch, John Bender (Judd Nelson), the jock Andrew (Emilio Estivez), and of course our favorite psychopath-basketcase (well..not including jack nicholson in the shining) Alison! (ally sheedy). well anyways these 5 completely opposite people all have saturday detention and of course when u put 5 people like that in a room together obviously something is going to occur..right. Now...this is my favorite movie because number 1) it has Bender in it god! i just love that guy 2) it has all the emotions rolled into one! it can be funny, sad, inspiring...etc...etc...and 3) it is just FUN! and the best teen film ever made!!
0451191153|5.0|One can safely say that both the tone and text of a review of THE FOUNTAINHEAD (or ATLAS or any of the other Rand books) is  determined more by the philosophical outlook of the reader than the actual story, characters or message.  I read this book some thirty years ago and reread it again recently just to see if it still &quot;rang true&quot; and if the same things that I liked and disliked the first time were still there.<br />I am glad to report that the story still is a powerful one - ignore the politics if you must.  The handling of the many relationships, the uniqueness of the characters, the totally unconventional love story, the tragic hero  - it was all still there.  Also, the same things I disliked were present - the lack of more female characters, the dryness of Roark, his wooden speeches...indeed, his presence is like a shadow. And just as the REAL hero in ATLAS was the very human Hank, the real central character in this book is the very human Wynand.  The portrait of this man is still - in my opinion - one of the best insights into the psyche of a complex, would-be-great individual I have ever read. <br />Perhaps the fact that Wynand was so &quot;like us&quot; and not on some stellar plane or residing on a lower rung of hell makes him such a likeably character.  The writing is deft, brilliant at times, turgid occasionally.  The arguments against collectivism still ring true.  The basis of collectivism is that the State, through force, attempts to create equality by distributing material and intellectual wealth from those who have it to those who don't.  The fact that the given wealth is unearned is apparently not important.  <br />And although it's been done without success many times, it will be tried again and again for one reason:  Those who contribute the most are fewer in number than those who simply &quot;go along for the ride&quot;.  Good book with some banal parts - great story and great blend of science, business and art.
B000026258|5.0|I don't know into what kinds of waves this composition puts your brain; delta, alpha, or what...but your brain will thank you for listening.  Occasionally the piece gets under the skin when it seems not to change (although no timbre is repeated more than 4 times.)  I have found that the intonation on the most recent recording is a bit off sometimes, but due to the nature of the piece this passes quite rapidly.<br />This is wonderful travel music.  Think of the underlying themes as the horizon and more rapid motifs as what moves by close to the road.  The hour-long piece will make the driving time fly by.  Watch for speeding.<br />This is also incredible for listening to whilst on a treadmill.<br />I hope you buy it.
0385504209|4.0|I think a true example of a talented author is one who can deliver a serious message while wrapping it inside a most entertaining story.  Dan Brown has achieved exactly that.  This is the best mystery novel I have read in sometime, and the revelations that Brown submits are fascinating.  It has encouraged me to study Da Vinci, The Bible, The Templar Knights and everything Renaissance.  This is one book that everyone, especially Christians, need to read.  The story DOES NOT lag in the middle, that is where all the good stuff is.  I promise you will not de disappointed.
0385504209|1.0|This is patheically poorly written. I am not a Christian. But I find the insipid and ignorant prose simply insulting to the intelligence of anyone capable of digesting more than a tasteless Hollywood B-Movie plot.  The fact that most of America is raving about this book says a lot about the masses in that country!<br />The examples of Brown's inaccuracies are countless.  It is, however, the brazenly crass contradictions that make one wonder about Mr. Brown's own intelligence.  Is he trying to snow us with passages like this one? :<br />\\"Sadly, Christian philosophy decided to embezzle the female's creative power by ignoring biological truth and making man the Creator.  Genesis tells us that Eve was created from Adam's rib....\\".<br />While I agree with his point about the sexes in Christianity, Genesis is, as we all well know, a book of the OLD Testament, stemming from Judaism, not Christianity.  The story of Adam and Eve goes a lot further back than Christianity.  Of course, Mr. Brown knows this. Had he written this book without the forward \\"FACT:\\", one could dismiss everything as poetic liscence.  This would of course assume some poetic and literary value, of which there is absolutely zero in this book.  Its really like watching bad tv.
B0000DJZA0|3.0|Yeah, yeah, I know that, coming from a discerning, proto-punk loving hipster, liking Coldplay is an impeachable offense. But I do. I like them a lot. That said, do we really need this live disc? After all, Coldplay are not a band especially known for their live innovation. So what Live 2003 comes off as is highlights from the two records with added reverb, worse mixing and slightly off vocals. That's not to say that the songs here aren't great, because they are, but this stands as one of the least essential live documents in recent memory. New song &quot;Moses&quot; is one of the most average songs in their catalogue and is nowhere near enough of a reason to give this a purchase. So, Live 2003 is barely recommended, but only for the completist.
B0000C1733|2.0|The release of this album is a godsend, because it means I don't have to review every Chili Peppers album detailing why I hate it. It's no secret that I did go through a RHCP phase a few years ago when I didn't know much better, but now I see them for what they are: nothing but overgrown dumbasses with misconceived notions of their own musical and sexual prowess. I won't deny that John Frusciante is one to often toss in some tasty licks and that Flea is a technically gifted bassist (if an excruciatingly annoyingly showy one), but it's all overruled by Anthony Kiedis' hideously inept stacatto rapping and his comically atrocious crooning. Next.
B0000AI45P|5.0|Finally it's here. New York punk group Television's 1977 debut is one of the most and best influential albums of all time. Inspiring everyone after from Joy Division to Sonic Youth, this is a true masterpiece. The guitar interplay and terse grooves remain just as powerful as they must have been 25 years ago - from the tight guitar-pop of \\"See No Evil\\" to the absolutely gorgeous sonic freak-out of the title track; it's all here on this record. Not only that, but the reissue adds five bonus tracks including the brilliant single \\"Little Johnny Jewel.\\" <BR>Verlaine's taut vocal delivery is perhaps the album's greatest asset. Here is, by the sounds of things, a disturbed man on a mission from the powers beyond to bring this music to the world. Verlaine is at once confused and confident, terrified and intimidating. <BR>If you don't own this, then you don't yet know what music is all about. Kneel and pray, because you will never be as good as this.
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;OK Computer&quot; took me an eternity to understand. Having adored The Bends and Kid A, I was initially underwhelmed by the work that is so often referred to as their masterpiece. The record seemed strangely subdued, and each song seemed to blend into one another. The one standout was &quot;Electioneering,&quot; and everything else was average. <BR>So I put the album away for two years and continued to listen to the aforementioned Radiohead albums. One day, however, I chanced upon the video for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and was truly blown away by how magnificent the song was. Had I really missed this grandeur the first time around? I resolved to return to OK Computer to figure out what, if anything, I had missed. <BR>From the second &quot;Airbag&quot; began, I knew that this was a very special album. Had my music taste been underdeveloped to the extent that I was unable to appreciate this kind of genius? Or was I just in a bad moon on the day that I first attempted to hear it? Either way, I was very wrong with my initial judgements. <BR>So OK Computer consists of one highlight after another. There's the driving sheen of &quot;Airbag,&quot; climaxing with Thom Yorke bellowing &quot;I am back to save the universe!&quot; There's the epic multi-part suite of &quot;Paranoid Android,&quot; the epitome of sonic menace. Then there's the truly awe inspiring beauty of &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien,&quot; reaching inconcievable heights of passion. &quot;Exit Music (for a Film),&quot; however, is low-key gloom, building into an overwhelming bridge. <BR>&quot;Let Down&quot; is a charming Brit-pop anthem, the most straightforward track on the album and remniscient of Blur at the top of their game. &quot;Karma Police,&quot; on the other hand, is menacing, terrifying and absolutely gorgeous. &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; and &quot;Electioneering&quot; are a powerful double salvo serving as Radiohead's highly succesful stab at social commentary. <BR>The album begins to wind down here. &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; is wonderfully shakey and uncertain. &quot;No Surprises&quot; is absolutely blissful songcraft. But it's &quot;Lucky&quot; that really serves as the climax of the album. Beginning with a melancholic verse and cascading with an incredibly euphoric cry of &quot;Save me from the aircrash,&quot; it's truly stunning. All that's left is the pretty &quot;The Tourist&quot; before the album grinds to a halt. <BR>Simply put, this is one of the greatest albums ever recorded and is the epitome of modern rock music. If you don't own it, then you are truly deprived.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Typical Joe, that he had to have his best work since London Calling released after his death. An undeniably important rock and roll figure he was, and he was also one of the few who was able to live what they preached. It's clear from Streetcore that, had he lived, he would have continued his path out of punk and toward solid rock and roll. Streetcore is absolutely fantastic, the sound of an artist at the peak of his game - making his death all the more tragic. Streetcore, it should be warned, also has an especially poignant rendition of Bob Marley's &quot;Redemption Song&quot; which brought this reviewer to tears upon first listen. No mistake about it, Joe Strummer's legend will continue forever, and Streetcore is a fitting epitath to the life of a genius. Farewell, Joe.
B00005YXZH|5.0|We all know it's a damn great album, and you can read every other review on this site to hear more. Because I want to dedicate this one to opening track &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,&quot; the opener and possibly the finest song of the last ten years. <BR>We begin with this strange electronic burble which is allowed to hover until the quietly shuffling drums enter. They seem confused and off-kilter, producing a strange loping beat which continues for a moment. But then the guitar enters, building into a forceful strum as a few finely placed bass notes punctuate the reverie. Suddenly, it all comes together. The bass, drums and guitar work to produce a sudden change in key, the effect of which is akin to a rush of blood to the head. <BR>And then comes Tweedy: &quot;I am an American aquarium drinker. I assassin down the avenue.&quot; His voice is simultaneously crushed and defiant, its low, melodic mumble conveying an amount of heartbreak which no lyric ever could. The first verse continues and then drops out, as the instrumental backing becomes increasingly powerful. The second verse is driven by a propulsively-strummed, ethereal guitar as Tweedy continues to mumble his muffled sweet nothings. <BR>Suddenly, there comes a simplistic piano riff, a babyish melody working almost solo as most of the other instruments drop out. But they once again build around this odd riff and the next verse shimmers into view. Tweedy's voice is now even more pained and the lyrics compliment this nicely. But its the next verse which really attains musical nirvana, when he murmurs &quot;You're such a quiet...domino, bury me now.&quot; He's letting go of his catharsis and starting to accept his defeatism, and the effect is nothing short of gorgeous. <BR>The instruments build again and suddenly all click together in an almost orgasmic burst of sound. But they all fade away for another verse, which seamlessly melts into the first and only chorus of the song. &quot;I am trying to breakyour heart,&quot; Tweedy almost whispers as the simple, beautiful bass line ripples under his voice. <BR>From here, there's almost two minutes of unabated instrumental madness as ringing telephones and assorted other found sounds cascade together, increasingly claustrophobic and terrifying. Suddenly, Tweedy comes once again out of the darkness, hollering an approximation of the first verse an entire octave above what was sang before. His voice is being torn to shreds as he screams these lines, sounding as though near tears. After this short burst, the instrumentation begins to fade. All that's left is his odd yelping of &quot;I'm the man who loves you&quot; before the song dissolves into a series of electronic wheezes. <BR>The effect of this song is nothing short of cosmic and incredibly moving. It's nothing that we've ever heard before and we'll be lucky if we ever hear it again. Its build from insular sadness to mad release is majestic in nature and stature, and the rest of the album is damn near as good.
B000000ISR|2.0|I have never been a Clapton fan, but I feel compelled to speak up here because this is one of the most truly overrated albums of all time. Take the title track - this would be decent guitar pop if it didn't have Eric's disgraceful vocals dumped on top of it. <BR>I don't really have a cohesive viewpoint to state. Just that this record stinks.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|So here's the buzz - after years of bootlegs and McCartney's constant bitching, we finally get a version of Let it Be stripped of all of Phil Spector's syrupy, quasi-Wall of Sound garbage. And here, Let it Be, for the first time, reveals itself as a truly brilliant record. ...Naked is, by definition, rawer and rougher than the original product; it buzzes and kicks like a garage rock record. &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; is more furious and exciting, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is beautiful without all the unnecessary strings and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is desolate without Spector's choirs - but in a good way. Of course, one must miss the off-the-cuff excellence of &quot;Dig It&quot; (which has been, alongside &quot;Maggie May,&quot; inexplicably removed), but Let it Be...Naked is still a somewhat modern-day classic.
B00006BTCA|5.0|On the other side of the spectrum, we have Interpol, who are truthfully closer to seminal goth-post punkers Joy Division than to Funkadelic and their ilk. However, throughout their debut Turn On the Bright Lights, there is a constant pulsating rhythm. By the far the chilliest (in fact downright creepiest) of the year, it builds an atmosphere of doom throughout the entire LP. Singer Paul Banks possesses a gothic wail at times evocative of what U2's Bono would sound like on downers and he uses it to majestic effect. On album highlight \\"Obstacle 1,\\" he exhibits a constant swagger until one line cracks his facade - \\"she's bad,\\" he suddenly whimpers, his voice cracking under the strain. It is not clear at all what the lyrics symbolize on the album, although they clearly mean quite a bit to Banks. It must be said, however, that it will be years before we can finally decipher the line \\"The subway, she is a porno.\\" <BR>One thing that Interpol posses which, at this point, Liars seem to lack is a sense of restraint. In fact, almost every song is delivered with a chilly detachment. But while when utilized by other artists (ooh, say Dido), this detachment can make the music unbearably smug and unlistenable, Interpol use this effect to create a constant feeling of internal catharsis, Banks clearly unsure of whether he despises life or loves it. <BR>There are moments, however, when this chilliness melts away. \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\" is an oddly exciting stomper in its own way. Possessing a drum and bass style similar to that of prime late 80s Madchester (think Stone Roses without the dance influence), it's the only song that will make you pogo around the room. And this is great, because Interpol realize that they don't have to resort to loud tactics to get you to love their album - they've read up on their rock history, and they know that invariably it's song writing that wins the day. <BR>Another classic moment on the album comes with \\"NYC,\\" which sets up a musical backdrop ofsweeping, chiming guitars and rolling drums to create a rhythm which is both beautiful and unsettling. Soon afterwards, Banks enters and sets forth a tale of being alienated in the big city which all of us can surely relate to. Finally, he enters the heart-tugging chorus of \\"New York cares - got to be some more change in my life,\\" crystalizing the bipolar double standard which characterizes the rest of the album. <BR>So in the end, there can only be one. And frankly, it's not hard. Because while Liars have the funk, Interpol have the songs - and in the end, that's all it really comes down to. This may not be for long - with this genre spreading wider than anyone could have expected, there are more great punk-funk bands (ie LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Radio 4) springing up each day. For now, however, Interpol are the kings.
B000002G7E|5.0|When a friend tells me that he's heard White Light/White Heat and he likes it, the feeling is akin to hearing that someone whom I really approve of is marrying my child. Not that I have any children. In fact, I'm really just assuming that the feeling would be akin to that. <BR>Anyway. <BR>White Light/White Heat and The Velvet Underground are the two albums by anyone which I feel closest to. What more can be said about White Light/White Heat which hasn't already been done to death? It's incredible. The title track and &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; are racuous and driving. &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation&quot; and &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; are both quirky and gorgeous. And &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;Sister Ray&quot; are unholy freakouts better than anything before or since. <BR>This is the greatest album of all time. I don't know what more to say.
6305922756|1.0|Simply one of the worst movies ever.
0385504209|3.0|This is really a potboiler: the plot is intriguing and has lots of twists, but I kept getting annoyed with his writing.  It felt like a movie script with lots of action but little else.  This is a fine novel if you want to pass some time, but it is not well-written from a prose point of view.
B00005JMCT|5.0|I loved this movie. I am very sad that Jim (Jason Biggs), Stifler (Seann W. Scott), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) and the rest of the AMERICAN cast are leaving. I think it would have been funny if Stilfer proposed to Cadence. It was a great movie and it is a SAD ending to a great series of movies. Eugene Levy does a great job as Jim's dad. Boy, I wouldn't want a father like him though!! They will always loved and truely missed in American hearts. Jim, Michelle, Stifler, Kevin, Finch, Oz(remember him?? where did he go?), Vicky (where did she go?), Jim's Dad, The Shermanator (I thought he would show), Stilfer's Mom, Nadia (guest appearance? I guess not), and the two ushers at Jim's wedding (i forget their names). They will always be missed and LOVED.
B000002H70|5.0|By saying this album is the pinnacle of the Cure's work, I don't intend to demean any other of their work.  Still, this is the album in which you can completely lose yourself.  In the \\"trilogy\\" of The Cure's best work (paraphrasing Robert Smith), Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers, Disintegration is the peak of the  bell curve.  All the passion of Pornography (their second best album - if you don't have it, your CD collection is worthless) without the intense despair underlying it, with the flow and intention of Bloodflowers, but without the maturity and self-awareness.  Disintegration is that scream of frustration associated with a Saturn return, mixed with experience, and anticipating an unknown future.  Musical brilliance.  It may take some time to really grasp the songs.  It took a live performance for me to finally understand the song \\"Disintegration\\", immediately turning into one of the most intense songs I've ever experienced, every time I hear it.  This album grows with you, your favorites changing as you grow.  How many albums can you say that about?
B00008H2LB|5.0|Really like this album.  The sound/feel/punch of Limp Biz (who, frankly, really did have a great thing with Starfish - and then went limp, as it were) is there on songs intended to sound that way - plenty of scratching on top of potent guitar layers.  But LP's musical/emotional range seems more broad/deep/genuine to me.  If you liked Starfish, this hooks you for 1,000 listenings the same way.  LP's music is much more &quot;studio&quot; than RATM, and they are far less &quot;revolutionary&quot; ... but I agree with a lot of reviewers that if you like Rage, you'll like this.  Perhaps the most interesting (and refreshing) observation is the Depeche Mode aftertaste on some songs - e.g., the front end of Numb (#13).  Most songs on this album are little works of art.  In my view, Meteora surpasses - or at least advances - the previous album, Hybrid Theory.

0385512104|5.0|Perhaps the most amazing quality of fiction is its ability to put us into the heads of those who cannot - or never get a chance to - tell their own stories. It's nearly impossible to imagine what goes on in the minds of, say, serial killers, or brainwashed cult fanatics, or the mentally retarded, which might explain why we find it so fascinating when writers attempt to show us. Beneath its unwieldy title, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is the story of an autistic teenager and his attempts to solve the mystery of a murdered neighborhood dog; but, of course, it's much more than that, too. <br />Christopher is a fifteen-year-old, mildly autistic boy who lives with his father in Swindon, a small town about a hundred miles outside London. His mother has passed away several years ago of cancer, so it's just Christopher and his father. During the days, Christopher attends a \\"special needs\\" school, where lessons include not only the three R's, but also tips on dealing with strangers and decoding facial expressions (Christopher can recognize happy and sad faces, but more complicated faces give him trouble). For a project, Christopher's teacher tells him to write a book about himself. Adding his own individual touches along the way (a math prodigy, the boy numbers his chapters not 1, 2, 3, but as prime numbers in ascending order), and peppering the text with illustrative tables and drawings, Christopher embarks on a detective story about Mrs. Shears's dog, stabbed to death in her yard with a garden fork. <br />Christopher's purpose in writing his book is to emulate his hero, Sherlock Holmes (whose logical mind he greatly admires), and solve the case. But his investigations unearth more about the relationships between his family and his neighbors than about the identity of the dog's killer. Unable to decode sarcasm, jokes, or figures of speech (he calls them all \\"lies,\\" since they aren't the truth), Christopher faithfully notes down his conversations and observations; though the reader, able to read between the lines, will guess the truth fairly quickly, Christopher's inability to understand social cues makes his struggle for answers all the more affecting. <br />Constantly bewildered by the (to him) incomprehensible behavior of those around him, Christopher resembles nothing so much as a human plunked down on a distant planet, trying desperately to figure out how to interpret the language and behavior of an alien species. And, in a way, many of Christopher's conclusions and actions make logical sense; but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Which is not to say Christopher can't also be infuriating, with his startling rigidity and resistance to change; he's prone to loss of bladder control and groaning fits when confused or scared by his surroundings - which is rather often. Nevertheless, he's deeply sympathetic and intensely believable, even if (like me) you've never met an autistic person before. <br />Other characters, such as Christopher's father and bereaved dog-owner Mrs. Shears, are realistically flawed and very convincing. They're not saints, by any means; Christopher's father tries hard to be patient, but can't control his frustration and anger, and all too often takes it out on his unresisting son. Mrs. Shears, for her part, is icily distant to Christopher. At first we assume that it's because of his insensitive poking into the death of her pet, but as the story progresses, we learn that her hostility stems from other, understandable (though not very noble) reasons. Obviously, Christopher's not responsible for his condition, and obviously he wouldn't have chosen to be as he is; but even though he can't help it, the boy is a heavy burden to those who must care for him, and frequent flare-ups of resentment and bitterness keep the story well away from saccharine TV-movie territory. <br />Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark revelations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love. I recommend this book highly! Another Amazon pick -- this one less known -- would be The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, about an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. These two books are my favorite reads so far of 2004!
B000002UAR|5.0|&quot;Q&quot; magazine in Britain just named Revolver the best album of all time! Yet another poll with Revolver coming out on top as the greatest ever!
B00000EZTQ|4.0|this  is  the  1981  follow-up  to  the  1978  classic.  John  Carpenter  co-writes ,  co-produces  but  doesn't  direct.  this  film  could  have  been  better  if  Carpenter  had  decided  to  direct  it.  there  were  rumors  that  Carpenter  did  direct  a  few  scenes  but  he  has  regularly  denied  it.  (Jamie  Lee  Curtis)  returns  as  Laurie.  Michael  Myers  is  played  by  (Dick  Warlock)  who  is  the  best  and  scariest looking  Michael  Myers  of  them  all.  (Donald  Pleasence) reprises  his  role  as  Dr.  Loomis.  Warlock  follows  Curtis  to  the  small  local  hospital  where  she  is  taken  for  treatment. the  hospital  is  occupied  by  only  one  security  guard  ,  one  doctor  and  a  few  nurses  including  (Tawny  Moyer)  and  (Pamela  Susan  Shoop)  and  two  ambulance  workers  (Lance  Guest)  and  (Leo  Rossi).  the  atmosphere  of  the  film  is  creepy  with  Warlock  roaming  the  halls  of  the  nearly  empty  hospital  and  the  suspense  really  picks  up  when  Warlock  and  Curtis  meet  up  towards  the  end  of  the  film.  this  film  is  not  as  good  as  the original  (but  how  many  sequels  ever  are?).  halloween  2  is  good  and  IT'S  THE  ONLY  SEQUEL  THAT  IS  WORTH  WATCHING  AT  ALL.
B00013PHGS|4.0|I'm not sure I can articulate why I like this CD, but I do find that it has that Eno-like quality of being seductively ambient, whatever that means. Essentially, Air is well named: not a lot of substance, but certainly important. The French duo have constructed a disc that will impress you intellectually and cast a spell over you in a near dream-like trance. It is absolutely a romance cd, and so the perfect soundscape for a very intimate dinner come Valentine's. <BR>Standing out from the batch are certainly the opening track, &quot;Venus&quot; and the follow up &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl,&quot; which completely mesmerizes me. Oddly, the track &quot;Tokyo&quot; is the least convincing on the whole CD, and in my case that's due largely to what a bore I thought &quot;Translation&quot; was as a movie (an extended Bill Murray joke that doesn't know when to end).<BR>Accompanying the CD is a DVD of Air in concert, along with a series of docu-video stuff. Musicians, unless they are Miles or Trane, should be heard and not spoken to, Air is no exception. The live footage though is interesting.<BR>File this under guilty pleasures, to the popside of Eno.
B000001Y5J|5.0|I started listening to NIN after finding out that Mr. Trent Reznor helped in the making of one of my favorite CDs, AntiChrist Superstar.  And after listening to a lot of NIN, i can easily hear the link between AS and NIN's music.  Which is good becuase i loved that CD and I'm happy that theres an entire band that sounds like that.  Also, about the hidden track, thats the exact same thing they did on the AS album, adding around 90 empty tracks of blank noises to hide the last song.
0385504209|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Whereas, I think Christians might find it offensive, the historical research and documentaion of the world's greatest artwork is astounding.  It is a mystery, a history book, and on top of it all is filled with great, believable charaters!
0553296981|5.0|Reading the diary of Anne Frank is an incredibly moving and thoughtful experience. Although it can be disconserting sometimes to be reading the most personal thought of a young girl.<br />Anne Frank is a young Jewish girl spanning from the ages of 13 to 15 throughout the book. She lives with her family in Amsterdam during WWII. They go into hiding in an attic with another family for 2 years to try and escape the Nazi's and, well, Hitler.<br />This whole book, especially the afterward will make you weep in sadness and shake in anger towards the Nazi's. It shows you how terrible life was for people, Jews especially during WWII. I urge you to read this book.
0812550706|5.0|When I first read this book in eight grade for a report, it stayed with me all those years (I am now in college). I couldn't remember the title of the book, but I knew some of the contents. So, I went to amazon and looked up what I knew. I found the title and immediately had to purchase it to read again. If you think the first reading was good, read it again after some time has gone by and re-live Ender's world all over again! I could not put it down. I finished it in a matter of days. If you even have a slither of interest in sci-fi at all, give this book a read! I can't wait to see what happens next (there are 7 total books in the series)! Have fun reading this book, I sure did!
B00005JKL8|4.0|&quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; is a great example of the action film that is so fast-paced, so visually dazzling, and so tense that the viewer doesn't have much time to think about the film itself.  Owen Wilson plays  battle-untested Navy navigator Chris Burnett who, while on a reconnaissance mission, is shot down over Bosnia.  Although both Burnett and his pilot escape alive, it quickly becomes clear they are in extreme danger.  While commanding officer Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman) begins plans for a rescue mission, he is hampered by those in command over him.<br />While the premise itself is formulaic - we've all seen this scenario many, many times - the tight pacing serves the movie well, as the viewer is thrust from one suspenseful scene to another, with barely time to breathe between each.  The cinematography supplies a gorgeous texture that contrasts powerfully with the destruction Burnett must both witness and turn from to save his life.  Both symbolic of the theme and visually powerful is the enormous statue of the Virgin Mary that Burnett parachutes past, her face beautiful on one side, blown away on the other.  Upon seeing this early in the movie, you know that this action film will have its message.<br />This thriller provides great, tense escapism, with people, buildings, and trucks blowing up or being shot to pieces every few minutes.  The suspense is aided by several original scenes, such as the heat-sensing satellite images being watched aboard the aircraft by carrier personnel.  They can see Burnett being approached but can't understand why his pursuers walk right by him. Unfortunately, if you stop to long to consider things that happen, and how people react, you'll run right smack into implausibilities, clich&eacute;s, and just plain stupidity.<br />I was torn about how many stars to give this film. I was riveted throughout despite its over-simplification and relative predictability.  The strongest feature of this film is its ability to draw the viewer into the plot and keep him there.  Just don't think too much about it afterward.  Four stars if you want to get lost in an action thriller, three stars if you want something more.into the plot and keep him there.  Just don't think too much about it afterward.  Four stars if you want to get lost in an action thriller, three stars if you want something more.
0393325172|5.0|Something about teams beckons us and bids us join them.  Watching the connection and camaraderie instills in us a wish to become part of something like that.  Like Batman and Robin, Green Hornet and Cato, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Lucky Jack Aubrey and Doctor Maturin will become inseparable in our minds.<br />This is the first book of a series and now a movie.  We join the HMS Sophie as she continues to harass enemy shipping and trading as well as burn outposts throughout the Mediterranean. This is the first meeting of the team as Maturin signs on as the ship's physician. Not only do the captain, Jack Aubrey, and Maturin become a great team, but we watch the crew of the Sophie all build a bond that makes each member indiscernible from the others.<br />Going through the day-to-day life on the sea and joining in the battles with them, the author does a good job with pacing.  The reader easily feels that he or she is part of the action.<br />I highly recommend this book with the caveat that it is addictive.  You will find yourself looking for the other books of the series.
B00008EY9G|3.0|this is more a review of amazon's review- get your facts straight on mental illness- this would connect to multiple personality disorder, NOT schizophrenia- two entirely different disorders. My brother has schizophrenia, and my whole family comes across one common myth after another that people believe.
B00013PHGS|4.0|Air take some different approaches to music and vocal progressions. This is an interesting album where I found myself figuring out the song in the first 30 seconds, enjoying it throughout, and guessing what was to come next. Great closing from Lost in Translation. This is one of the more original albums I've heard in a long time. Air has the balls to blow up a balloon.
1400034779|5.0|A beautiful story, the life of Mma Ramotswe a detective agent in Botswana, Africa. She takes us back through her childhood and brings us to the present to meet her customers where each story unfolds two pictures of Africa now and then. Mma Ramotswe symbolizing the modern African woman and the conflict that goes between modernization and culture. Humor is one of Mma Ramotswe's qualities and she never fails to make you laugh out loud! Whether she's analyzing her problems or trying to solve a mystery.. it is so simple and hilarious!<br />She loves her country, but tries hard to eradicate horrible old beliefs. She cherishes her freedom and the new way of life but nevertheless holds tight to her roots. She portrays wisdom and femininity, and pours out her opinion whenever possible. A romantic ending to a beautiful story!
B00005RFVL|5.0|I was a that great of a fan to Robbie WIlliams but I must admit kudos to him on this swing album. It brings back all the great swing era sounds and his voice is amazing. Never thought I would support an ex-Take That star... but this one is a worth while buY!~!~
B00008ADPF|5.0|All of you who keep comparing this CD to Silver Side Up, or any other Nickelback CD for that matter, doesn't quite get it - it's a new CD.  While unmistakably Nickelback, it is a different CD.  (I know because I've recently acquired their entire library.)  And in this case, different is definitely good.  Now let's judge it on its own merits - fresh and outstanding.  Any questions?
0385504209|2.0|I bought this book because my brother's birthday is coming up in six days, and he loves bestsellers.  I've never heard of Dan Brown before, and actually had quite a job to find the book in local (New Zealand) bookstores. (I found it in a wine-and-food market! -- upscale market, and the book is new, I hastily add.)<br />I'm puzzled because everyone calls it a page-turner.  What is it I am not seeing?  I've managed to get to page 217, so I've done quite well, I guess, but the cardboard characters and trivial-pursuit-driven plot just don't get me turning pages.  It's fearfully easy to put down, and awfully hard to pick it up again, but if I want to get to the end, I have only five days to do it!<br />This is quite an admission from someone who normally reads a book a day.  Perhaps my problem is that the last book I read was the second in Bernard Cornwell's astounding Grail series.  Granted, it is a different genre, but the craftsmanship and sense of immediacy that Cornwell manages is on a different plane, too.  However, I would hesitate to suggest that anyone reads the Cornwell Grail series instead of this book, because so many people enjoy The Da Vinci Code, obviously -- and why should I ruin someone else's nice day.<br />I guess it will be made into a movie.  It reads like that was the ultimate aim.  But I doubt I will bother to go to see it -- even if it does have Harrison Ford!
6305841861|5.0|After seeing Evil Dead II, the first question that comes to mind is whether or not you will remember it as scary or funny. Although the movie has tense situations which makes you appreciate it more, you can't help but laugh at a lot of the scenes which I think was Sam Raimi's intent. If you have never seen this movie, my best suggestion is that you also see Army of Darkness right after. Although the two movies are very different, they are similiar comedy wise and it finishes the story. ***Don't see this movie if you are faint of heart and have a problem watching blood and gore.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|a beautiful, understated film that doesn't try to do too much.  Lush cinematography you can almost feel and an amazingly nuanced performance from Bill Murray would be enough reason to see this film, but you get so much more.<BR>  American audiences tend to be confused by and hostile toward ambiguity, which is the foundation of this movie.  Part of the magic is how well it translates such a nebulous concept into filmic reality.
B000002KHH|5.0|I knew nothing of Black Sabbath other than I loved the song &quot;Paranoid&quot; in &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; and that I could play &quot;Iron Man&quot; on the guitar almost by instinct. But I generally hate heavy metal (fans), and since everyone knows Black Sabbath are the great godfathers of that genre, I had no interest beyond that. Then my roommate bludgeoned by eyes open to the truth and I realized that while I thought I liked Led Zeppelin, I really loved Black Sabbath instead. &quot;Electric Funeral&quot; and &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; are the best songs you've never heard until you have, and are worth yelling along to while everyone else in the house is sleeping.

079070546X|5.0|This is by far one of the best comedies I have ever seen.  This fresh, imaginative comedy can be watched year after year, and the humor never gets old.  In fact, Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without the Griswalds!<br />Although their children are always different, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are a perfect match for portraying the campy couple, Clark and Ellen Griswald, who want to have a nice Christmas at home with the family.  One disaster after another ensues, and every one of us can relate to something.  Has your cat ever chewed on the Christmas tree lights?  Ever accidentally taken off an old man's toupee?  Spend endless hours putting up Christmas lights and they won't come on?  <br />Of course, no National Lampoon vacation would be right without Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid).  Although is brain is on the small side, and his wife and kids are straight out of a trailer park, he has the best of intentions.  When Clark describes to the children at Christmas Eve dinner that the newscasts have reported sightings of Santa's sleigh, Eddie wonderingly asks, &quot;Are you serious, Clark...?&quot;<br />Another great aspect of this movie, is the addition of the snobby, yuppy neighbors, Todd and Margo (Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss), whose biggest pet peeves revolve around the lovable Griswalds.  You will love to hate this stuck-up couple, and take great glee in watching them suffer the torments piled on by Clark and family.  From the blinding light of 10,000 white Christmas lights, to the tree crashing through their window, it is high comedy living next to the Griswalds.<br />Chevy Chase is truly at his finest in as Clark W. Griswald.  This film promises endless laughs, lots of good times and a true classic to be revered for all time.

It is nonsence. Sorry for possible mistake. I would be proud of you if you could just move your finger!!! THis movie is complete mess. Who did this Massacre and what for - this is not informated till the end of the movie. But as I said before - If you like blood without any explanation  - do forward.

B0000C7PQK|5.0|The latest release from Enigma is as captivating as previous releases. Voyaguer is a varied style of music somewhat standing alone from previous releases. It definately shows the styles of Michael Cretu' and his group of associated artists. I have many if not all of Enigma's releases, including the singles. I'll always be a Enigma fan and look forward to future releases.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I really don't have anything new to say about this CD, but I would like to point out that contrary to one of the other reviewer's statements, my copy of this CD did not have any copy protection. I put it on my computer with iTunes fine, and I listen to it all the time on my iPod.
B000084T18|5.0|If anyone knows rap, or music for that matter, would know that Get Rich or Die Tryin is one of the best rap album in years.  50's flow is unmatched, the beats are made from the best in the business, and his lyrics are just nasty!  Every song on the CD is good.  You have to listen to every song carefully to really appreciate how great it really is it.  You had to live that life to understand what he's saying.  And to anyone that says JaRule is better, needs to stop listening to music.  Ja and his crew are so fake.  &quot;They screamin murders but walkin with no guns&quot;-Young Buck.  Thats why they droped the murder, and are now just &quot;The Inc&quot;.  Dont waste your time with them.  The G-Unit CD &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot; is a good cd to, but nearly as good as &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin.&quot;
B0000TB050|5.0|Although it's more or less the same show as Live in Boston--on a different stage--it's worth owning for the small variations.<br />a) The band of course sounds great and is obviously thrilled to be playing in their hometown.<br />b) The setting--Slane Castle--is amazing.  Also, check out the stage background being projected during &quot;With or Without You&quot;--so cool<br />c) Of course the band sounds great, save for what I always thought was a lame acoustic version of &quot;Desire.&quot;<br />d) There's a couple of songs not on &quot;Live in Boston,&quot; most notably the song which they announce as their first single ever: &quot;Out of Control.&quot;  (The only thing from Boy on LIB was, as I recall &quot;I Will Follow&quot;).<br />e) There's even a kickass version of &quot;Sunday, Bloody, Sunday,&quot; a song you'd think they'd be sick of playing by now.  Obviously not.<br />If you already have LIB you pretty much have this show (I enjoyed that DVD a lot more than apparently some people here).  For hardcore fans, though, this is probably a must-have. <br />KILLER BONUS: The long-lost documentary &quot;The Making of Unforgettable Fire&quot; is reissued as a bonus on this DVD.  If you haven't seen it, it's a kick to see them back in the 80s (Bono's mullet!) and in what began their experimental phase with Dan Lanois and Brian Eno.  You wouldn't believe how many different ways they kept tweaking &quot;Pride&quot; before they finally just left it alone, as evidenced in this film.  There's also some classic footage of Bono--in his &quot;improvised&quot; lyrics period--faking his way through what would eventually become &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;.
B000088E6D|5.0|O.K., so I watched the American Idol show where one of the judges (Jackson) mentioned Michael's name. For Michael to now be used as a 'measure' by which others are judged is a credit to the impact Bublé has had on the music scene this past year.<BR>I work in a department store (electronics/music department) and have for the past 6 years so can really see what customers are looking for, and more importantly buying. With little if any promos here in Ontario, Bublé has continued to be a top seller. It is word of mouth that's influencing most buyers decision to purchase this dreamy cd. And word of mouth suggests that his voice and style are only beginning to be discovered. The majority of our customers are professionals in their 40's, but what has been a pleasure to watch is the increase of sales to those teens or early twentysomethings!<BR>Bublé has put out a great offering of songs - and without question the final cut on the cd - That's All - is the all time greatest version ever done!! <br />So to the reviewer who dismissed Idol's recognition, take it from me, Bublé DESERVES credit for his rich and beautiful sounding songs. Outstanding cd.
B00005JM02|5.0|As grandparents, my wife and I appreciate films such as this which really do offer \\"something for everyone,\\" especially when our grandchildren urge us to see it with them again and again and again and again....The same is true of Antz, A Bug's Life, Shrek, Toy Story and Toy Story 2, and Monsters. All of these animated films offer an interesting story line and memorable characters, to be sure, but they also offer wholesome humor on several different levels of sophistication, humor which thus delights viewers of all ages.<br />Featuring the voices of Albert Brooks (Marlin), Ellen DeGeneres (Dory), and Alexander Gould (Nemo), it focuses on a father and son who are separated by circumstances best revealed in the film. Marlin (the father) sets out to find his son and is joined by Dory. Along the way, Marlin and Dory share life-threatening experiences in the vast ocean. Meanwhile, Nemo finds himself in a dentist's fish tank. Eventually -- after numerous adventures --  father and son are finally reunited.<br />This theme of separation also invests earlier animated classics with authentic tension, as in Dumbo and Pinocchio, to name but two. For me, Finding Nemo dramatizes a number of important lessons which even younger children seem to recognize. For example, be alert to the possible dangers around you. Respect your parents' concerns about protecting you from such dangers. Be a loyal friend. Help others in need. Keep the faith. Be persistent when you encounter difficulties. By no means is this a \\"preachy\\" film, however, even as it skillfully affirms certain values such as these.<br />Indeed, although appropriately serious at times, Finding Nemo is mostly a humorous film, in large measure because of the verbal skills of Brooks and DeGeneres. Other easily recognizable voices include those of Willem Dafoe (Gill), Allison Janney (Peach), John Ratzenberger (Fish School), and Geoffrey Rusch (Nigel). Andrew Stanton co-directed this film with Lee Unkich and co-authored the screenplay. He deserves special credit for matching a proper human voice with each fish character. In my opinion, also, the quality of animation is unsurpassed. For these and other reasons, Finding Nemo is among our family's favorites.<br />Although many of the DVD's special features will probably not be of much interest to younger children, older viewers will enjoy &quot;Making Nemo&quot; (a documentary), &quot;The Art of Nemo&quot; (narrated by the artists), &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot; (a new short with Jean-Michel Cousteau), Knick Knack (a Pixar short with commentary), a brief preview of the next Pixar film, The Incredibles, followed by a tour of the Pixar Studios.enplay.

0385504209|5.0|I have seldom, if ever, been so completely entranced by a book.  I stole every possible minute from my busy schedule to read this book.  Rather than being insulted by flimsy, ill-researched &quot;factoids&quot;, this book culls all of ones knowledge and focuses it to a fine point.  Without being pretentious Dan Brown has stitched together spiral shaped mini-plots into a winding Nautilus to make the over-all plot onfold brilliantly while keeping you totally blind to what is coming next.  The writing is unimpeachable, and you will find yourself flipping back several chapters as a seemingly new clue is revealed to be merely an echo of something you overlooked earlier.  Rilliant.  I am now an official Dan Brown afficionado!!!!  I can't wait for the next book!
B00005ATQF|5.0|Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short-Timers and directed by Stanley Kubrick who co-authored the screenplay, this film answers two questions: What was it like for a recruit to go through Marine boot camp during the Viet Nam War, and, what was combat like in that war? Unlike a previous Kubrick film, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket neither makes nor implies any anti-war statements. Rather, in my opinion, the two separate but related portrayals \\"tell it like it was.\\" When I first saw this film 25 years ago, my reactions resembled those of Private Benjamin during her own boot camp training: shock and denial. Having never served in a military service, I simply could not believe that Marine recruits are subjected to such abuse, both physical and verbal. One of my sons served in the Marines and confirms what other Marines of my own generation assert, that Full Metal Jacket is about as realistic as a film could be. Older friends who were involved in D-Day make the same claim for Saving Private Ryan.<br />In any event, the primary plot during the boot camp sequence focuses on Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), nicknamed \\"Gomer Pyle,\\" and his struggles to survive constant humiliation by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a former Marine D.I.) Played by Matthew Modine, J.T. Davis (\\"Joker\\") does everything humanly possible to help him. Months later while on an assignment for Stars &amp; Stripes magazine,  \\"Joker\\" accompanies a squad in the Khe San area. Once under attack by a Viet Cong sniper, most of the Marines react according to their boot camp training. Of special interest to me is the character Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) who has become a highly-skilled (probably psychotic) warrior. He defies authority with the instincts of a ferocious animal but, at the same time, reveals a sincere and endearing concern for the welfare of his comrades. It remains for each person who sees this film to determine to what extent (if any) it is \\"anti-\\" anything. And perhaps at least a few will share my own initial reaction: Full Metal Jacket consists of two separate but inseparable films which share the same title. Together, they have enduring dramatic impact.least a few will share my own initial reaction: Full Metal Jacket consists of two separate but inseparable films which share the same title.

B000069AUI|4.0|Excellent, lots of great songs, very pleasing to listen to.
B00013PHGS|5.0|To me, Air is one of the few can-do-no-wrong bands: each offering I love and as Talkie Walkie confirms, utterly unique. I'm happy that Air's recent two LPs weren't the sequel to Moon Safari: that record was a milestone, and we must move on. Obviously, like all Air records, this release is an essential. That said, I didn't love the DVD; kinda boring watching them play video games and walk around hotels. It didn't enhance - or hurt - my love for this duo. I said love twice.
B00005JM20|3.0|I waited for DVD to watch this one, and I'm glad. It's a mediocre film and it's much easier to enjoy a so-so movie at home than when you're paying $8 in a theater.<br />Johnny English is Rowan Atkinson's spoof on spy films. Yes, it is a spoof. I've seen more than one review that lauds this as a \\"serious\\" spy movie that simply has funny moments. That's ridiculous. This is a spoof. There is nothing about this plot that is believable or the least bit surprising. Not that that's bad - just please don't think that you are about to view a serious \\"spy\\" film that has a legitimate plot, a formidable villain and a believable love interest. What it actually is, however, is a pretty funny Mr. Bean-esque romp through England. It's fun watching Atkinson bumble his way through awkward situation after awkward situation. Similar to the Pink Panther films.<br />The movie's concept is that all the secret agents in England are killed by a terrorist bombing- all except for Johnny English and his sidekick Boff. The timing couldn't be worse for England, since there's a plot uncovered to steal the Crown Jewels. Enter the bad guy, Pascal played by John Malchovich. Now, I have to enter a little side comment here. Malchovich does an accent and he honestly sounds like a Frenchman with brain damage. It just doesn't work. I've probably heard worse, but seriously - it's difficult to concentrate on anything he says.<br />From here we get to see Atkinson, the least suave spy ever, put in situation after situation where he screws it all up. It's almost always funny. It's when the plot tries to develop that the movie fails a little. It's very unbelievable and has a Frenchman becoming King of England. Overall, it works somewhat, since it clearly defines the movie as a joke and not to be taken seriously, which strengthens the humor in places and weakens it in others. <br />Natalie Imbruglia plays the mysterious woman whom we all know is really a spy. She's beautiful, and it's worth watching just to look at her for an hour and a half.<br />All in all, give it a chance. The special features are fun and the movie has laugh out loud moments (Atkinson telling the head of the secret service that they are in the \\"most secure place in the whole of England\\" just as a huge explosion rings in the background, for example). I think it has some repeat watchability. I don't know that I'd buy it. Rent it first.

B00013PHGS|3.0|After listening to &quot;Talkie Walkie,&quot; and knowing what Dunckel and Godin are capable of from past efforts (despite the critics, I loved &quot;10,000 Hz Legend&quot;), I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  <br />It is not, by any means, a bad album.  It's certainly listenable, although &quot;Moon Safari&quot; achieved this, and managed to be a great album at the same time.  Here, especially in contrast to &quot;Legend,&quot; Air seems to hold back from giving it their all.  <br />Still, there are some glimmers of hope in &quot;Alpha Beta Gaga&quot; and &quot;Mike Mills.&quot;  Ironically, the strongest tracks here are instrumentals, something that they excel at.  The lyrics for pop ballads such as &quot;Run&quot; (&quot;Holy girl don't get up for running&quot;) stand out as being exceptionally poorly written, especially for Air standards, and the accents of Godin and Dunckel seem especially thick on this outing.  <br />Perhaps it's the earnestness of it all that I have a problem with, lacking the playfulness of &quot;Moon Safari&quot; or the techno silliness of &quot;Legend.&quot;  Air doesn't work well irony free, especially when the lyrics border on being broken English.<br />I don't know if I'm in the minority here, but I wouldn't be adverse to Air dabbling a few French-language tracks here and there on their next album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didnt even realize this show was on TV untill it was canceled, and I'm a huge Buffy/Angel fan. 1 week ago I bought the DVD set and..well..everynight since I bought it I have watched it. I am on the 3rd time through the episodes. TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY ON HOW GOOD THIS SHOW IS! It has really pulled me in. The cast, the writing, the set, the costumes and the music puts you in the world Joss Whedon created. The episode \\"Out of Gas\\" has to be one of the best TV episodes ever. This said, I can understand why the show didnt survive..Fox didnt promote it, they put it on a bad night and slot and didnt show the pilot. YES, they didnt show the pilot...and they had Joss and Tim Menear write the second episode \\"The Train Job\\" over the course of 1 weekend. Still a great episode but they had to explain the characters in a hurried fashion. This show never really got a swinging chance and its really too bad. The Firefly fans can only hope and pray that the show gets another chance somewhere in Movie/TV land. Buy this DVD set, it is amazing.

Now he is older, and wiser, and offers a great deal of information about how Europe has changed, and how it has remained the same. Starting in Scandanavia, he travels around a great deal of the European continent. There were some countries he missed (I would have loved to hear what he said about Iberia, and Greece, and some more of the Eastern European states), but it was great fun to read.

0060537639|1.0|- <BR>Adjust view/encoding to read Chinese text<br />0 star if I may<br />EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY PROOF.<br />Don¡¯t read 1421 unless you have read Louise Levathes¡¯ When China Ruled the Seas.<br />1. 1421 is based on the premise that Puerto Rico was mapped in the 1424 before any European had arrived there. Menizes argued that since the Chinese had launched large-scale expeditions to the ¡°West Ocean¡±; it had to be the Chinese who discovered America. This premise collapses if:<BR>a. that island is not Puerto Rico, or<BR>b. the Chart was not made in 1424, or<BR>c. the portion of the Chart that shows that island was added after Columbus arrived the Caribbean.<br />Menzies never discussed these three possibilities. Rather, he was ignorant of (or ignoring?) previous research on the Pizzigano Chart. In particular, he omitted the finding made by Manuel Luciano da Silva about ¡°Antilia¡± <br />Menzies rotated the Pizzigano Chart to make Antilia look like Puerto Rico.<br />2. Menzies ignored all Chinese sources specific to the expeditions. The Chinese had debated about the expeditions for decades. A credible book has to sort out the controversies and debates from Chinese sources. <br />3. Menzies also failed to incorporate a vast amount English-writing articles on the Zheng He expeditions.<br />4. Menzies is handicapped by his inability to read Chinese. In relying on translations of old Chinese text he frequently misinterpreted the true meaning. In some occasions, he left out evidence against his argument. <br />On page 55, Menizes stated that Liu Daxia, (Áõ´óÏÄ) destroyed the navigation logs. Menzies footnoted that to Joseph Needham. Readers should check whether misquotation happened. In fact, books, navigational instructions, and many other materials were published contemporary and immediately after the expedition era. There was no systematic purge of records.<br />Regardless of what Needham and Duyvendak said, let us go to the original source on which such allegation was based -- ¡¶ÊâÓòÖÜ×ÉÂ¼¡·(An Account of Traveling in Exotic Territories) written in 1574. The Account mentioned that around 1466 to 1469, Liu Daxia refused to hand over old government files on the expeditions to the Minister of War. In defending his action, Liu said:<BR>¡°The Zheng¡¯s expeditions cost hundred thousands of money and grains; It wasted tens of thousands lives of civilians and military personnel. Even the expeditions brought exotic treasures, what kind of good would it give to the country? Any officials should remonstrate strongly with the emperor against this evil policy. The old files are around but they should be destroyed to stop such stupidity. Why do you complain about not having them?¡±<br />Menzies quoted parts of this paragraph and mixed it with other quotes. The official historical record (made in early Ching Dynasty) stated a slightly different version: Liu hid the files from being used for the preparation of a military campaign in Northern Vietnam. Both sources do NOT indicate file destruction. <br />Since the mandarins were against these expeditions, had Liu really destroyed these files, he would have been honored as a national hero. <br />It is likely that those files just got misplaced by the end of the Dynasty. Or they were destroyed during the 1645 fire when the mob invaded Beijing and the palace.<br />5. Menzies never discussed the technical feasibility of building the treasure ship. This ship measured 480 ft (160 m) in length and their masts were over 400 ft tall. This is a ship two-third of the length of the Titanic and the mast height, according to 1421, equals to that of a 40-story building. It has a draught of 30 to 40 ft, so it could not sail through channels less than 40 ft deep. Can we build it today? Should Menzies consult shipbuilding experts?<br />6. Menzies is evasive regarding archeological evidences. Where are the exact locations? Who are involved in the dig? What is the reputation of the digging team? When did it take place and where was the findings published? Independent verification and transparency are so important in archeology.<br />7. The test of the presence of Chinese, from an anthropological perspective, is to see whether chopsticks are used. <br />Additional sources (only for serious readers who would do an Internet research):<br />In English<BR>a.

B000002NC4|5.0|Perfect From Now On is sandwiched in-between two classic records of brilliantly quirky indie-pop, There Is Nothing Wrong With Love and Keep It Like A Secret. And Perfect From Now On couldn't sound further from those two records. On their major-label debut, BTS decided to release an LP of eight epic songs, many of them decidely dark and serious in tone. The record opens with the excellent &quot;Randy Describes Eternity,&quot; a slow-building epic that represents a significant change in tone for the band. From there, the next two songs are in the same vein, except for their driving ending and mid-sections. &quot;I Would Hurt A Fly&quot; explodes mid-way through into an excellent guitar-workout by leader Doug Martsch while &quot;Stop The Show&quot; becomes an upbeat, though slightly foreboding, rocker mid-way through. Eventually, Built To Spill lighten the mood, yet continue the somber, emotional mood. &quot;Velvet Waltz&quot; is beyond excellent while &quot;Out Of Site&quot; and &quot;Kicked It In The Sun&quot; are drawn-out songs in a more familiar BTS aesthetic. If anything, Perfect From Now On may be Built To Spill's most &quot;mature&quot; effort, although the band has always had a firm grasp on their material. On Perfect, you won't find a &quot;Car,&quot; &quot;In The Morning,&quot; &quot;You Were Right,&quot; or &quot;Sidewalk.&quot; But what you will find is one of their strongest full-length works. Not the best place for those new to BTS to start (I'd recommend There Is Nothing Wrong... or Keep It Like A Secret for starters), Perfect... is an essential for anyone who even remotely likes Built To Spill. It will surprise you, in a very good way.
0671015206|5.0|I Read Thoreau's Walden when I was a young teenager and was struck with his initial essay on economics. I believe the message he gave is the same as what the authors have found by research. Most people generally want to be rich because they want to have the outward appearance of display or the feeling they would no longer need to discipline themselves. They end up leading precarious, worried, sad lives; Lives of quiet desperation. The millionaires in the book were happy people. They were leading simple, independent lives without much care for outward appearances. They didn't spend money because extra `things' were less likely to make them happy than being independent. Thoreau said that people would buy a new pair of pants rather than patch the old, because they were so concerned with appearances. Today, people will buy a new car, before they've paid for the old, because they believe they deserve a new toy or to help them live up to the image they have of themselves. You should not envy the wealth these millionaires have, you should envy their priorities.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One facet of the show that was often misunderstood was the idea, that this was merely a western in space, a space cowboy show. No. What I saw was an extremely clever take on technology; how some can afford it and some cannot. Look at our own world, you'll find some countries with high tech while other parts of the globe rely on much older technology. That was the Firefly vision, we're not one homogenous collective, all living at the same state of technology, we span a broad range. Spread out in space, do you really think everyone could afford Star-Trek style high tech?
B000003TAR|5.0|Personally, I prefer this to their megahit, 'Nevermind'.  It is much rawer, less accessible and everything Kurt Cobain wanted it to be.  The only exception to that I suppose would be that it was still a hugely successful album.  Not as much so as 'Nevermind', but it still has sold 5 million copies, which is nothing to sneeze at.
B00005JMGL|3.0|This movie has both pros and cons.  There are more pros than cons, but the few cons here are quite heavy.<br />The cons:<br />The movie isn't long enough.  It should have been extended to 2 1/2 hours.  Many feastful sights appear consecutively, but it isn't long before they disappear and aren't seen again throughout the movie.  Everything seems to go by too quickly to remember much that happened.<br />Jeremy Sumpter is utterly dashing and certainly has the perfect Peter Pan look and an awe-inspiring athletic ability, but when it came to acting, he just didn't quite cut it.  It's true that he tries his best, don't get me wrong, and he does have his points where he shines (particularly in the scene where Tink almost dies from drinking Captain Hook's poison).  At times he seems to be the only one that could do the role, but overall, he mostly fails not only to really convey Peter's inexhaustible sense of fun, adventure, and vitality, but also to overcome sticking out like a sore thumb, being the only American in a cast full of Brits and Australians.  I kept trying to see him as the ideal Peter Pan, but he messes up so many times that it completely threw me off.<br />The French screen sensation Ludivine Sagnier is wasted as Tinkerbell, a completely unappealing little fairy who does none other than ham it all up with her annoying obnoxiousness.  What would have been nicer was if they had Tink keep her mischievousness and arrogance, but had a more restrained side to her that would give us a truly magical impression of a fairy, much like the one in the Disney version.  Did they really have to turn Tinker into a stinker?  Gee whiz!<br />Also wasted is the much-loved Lynn Redgrave, who plays the role of a rather unnecessary new character Aunt Millicent.  Her place in the movie is not at all important but to appraise Wendy for marriage, but later to be exemplified as grotesquely comic and off-the-wall.  For instance, sometime later in the film, we get a glimpse of her in thebathtub at one point, singing, \\"I do believe in fairies\\" in a high-pitched voice, and she ruins the movie's final scene by whooping loudly when she realizes she gets to be the mother of one of the lost boys, instead of doing something touching like crying with tears of happiness.<br />The pros:<br />Newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood is radiant and angelic as Wendy Darling.  She shows a convincing talent that demonstrates a fine range of enlightenment and poignant drama, which suits the pivotal role of Wendy perfectly.  Her acting here never loses its credibility for one moment.  I feel she has been robbed of a 2003 Best Actress Oscar nomination for her fine work here, but that doesn't mean she may not get one in the future, because you can expect a long and successful career for this gifted English rose.  I can't wait to see what she does next.<br />Also great to watch is Jason Isaacs, who does a knockout job  playing the menacing, ill-mannered Captain Hook.  He is simply the most adequate Captain Hook in all of movie history, performing with a wonderful mix of monstrosity and black comedy.  He also does a terrific job as the stern but devoted father Mr. Darling, handling his dramatic complexity admirably well.  He was no less clever than Johnny Depp was in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", so if Johnny Depp was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, why not Jason Isaacs?!!<br />Olivia Williams brings the perfect motherly warmth to her role as Mrs. Darling.<br />All the lost boys are terrific.<br />Richard Briers, as Hook's assistant Smee, adds some great aside jokes, which always call for a laugh.<br />The sets are just glorious: the Darling home in London, the nursery, the London sky, the Neverland forests, the Jolly Roger, the Black Castle, the Mermaid Lagoon, the Home Underground.  What a sight.<br />The narration, provided by Saffron Burrows, is lovely.  Her voice is so rich and soothing that it's impossible not to be drawn in.<br />James Newton Howard's music score is a winner.It's just perfect to suit the story.  He creates a Peter Pan music score more magical than we could ever have hoped for.  No wonder he's a five-time Oscar nominee.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I'm not really writing a review of the C.D. (which is awsome!) but rather to talk about todays generation of music. First off &quot;Fred Durst Fan Numba One&quot; you need to get a lesson in music. First off, Radiohead and your lovely Limp Bizkit did NOT exsist before Pink Floyd, so your idiotic theory that Pink Floyd copied off them is irrelevant. Second, go back to school, learn to write properly and then try to write a review. Third --- YOU'RE THE BIGGEST MORON WHO POSTS ON THIS SITE! When you finish grade school and learn to read and write then you can try to talk about the C.D. Also, when you grow up you might be able to actually appreciate the 60's and 70's music industry. Until then tell &quot;mommy&quot; to get you a pacifier and put on your beloved Limp Bizkit and then she and &quot;Freddie&quot; can rock you to sleeep you LOSER!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|For my own understanding of all the points that Madonna defenders are trying to make, it would be helpful if they learned to write and spell in English--and to make a complete sentence and thought.  This review page is dedicated to Cher's farewell tour, but many people continue to bash Cher and praise Madonna on it.  To answer some of the questions that Rico claims cannot be answered, Madonna has sold millions and millions of albums all over the world because she is a marketing wizard.  She latches onto the &quot;sound du joir&quot; and &quot;producer du joir&quot;, and the world flocks to her sound--although it is refreshing to see the rejection of &quot;American Life&quot;, which Madonna obviously gave zero thought in creating.  <br />Huge album sales do not make someone a diva, my friend.  Album sales are a reflection of one thing: Madonna's ability to ride whatever is the &quot;wave of the day&quot;.  I've said it before: Cher is REAL.  Madonna is....well, no one knows who she is because she is never genuine.  She is always affected, always trying to push buttons and cause controversy--always trying to do &quot;whatever&quot; will keep her in the limelight.  Cher has never had to resort to this desperation.  She is true to herself and to her fans.  That is something I am still waiting, after 20 years now, to see Madonna do.
6304479689|5.0|&quot;Elvis On Tour&quot; captures a loose, energetic King on the road. It features dozens of innovative split screen shots of Elvis. Whether he's making a quip or showing off his karate moves, this is Elvis at his peak.<br />&quot;Elvis On Tour&quot; is much looser than &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot;. He does not seem nervous like he did on the previous tape, and he adds extra flare to the songs that he performed in the previous outing. Elvis's voice is in its greatest shape ever here. He delivers a powerful, intense vocal performance on &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, then gives a gentle reading of &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;. The rockers are also extremely good. Elvis gives electrifying versions of &quot;A Big Hink O' Love&quot; and &quot;Lawdy, Miss Clawdy&quot;, plus a good version of &quot;I Got A Woman&quot;. Closing this magnificient video is a beatiful rendition of &quot;Can't Help Falling In Love&quot;.<br />I do have one gripe however. On the &quot;Lost Performances&quot; video, there are several performances filmed for this video that should've have been included. These songs are a powerful &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight&quot;, &quot;I Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, &quot;Release Me&quot;, &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;/&quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;, and a stunningly beautiful &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;. However, this truly is a must - have. Elvis is truly at his finest hour, his last moment of glory before sinking into the pits of drugs and fatty food.
B00005JLRT|1.0|How to ruin Star Trek The Next Generation.<BR>Firstly,ditch ILM despite all the good work that they did with the special effects of six other Star Trek film.<BR>Secondly,make a mean spirited film where the cast are absolutely helpless against the opposition-Troi is helpless,Data is helpless,Picard loses a fight with a dying man,even the Enterprise is helpless. What was the point?<BR>Thirdly,have a villian that is pathetic rather than villianous- Shinzon is a frustated virgin that perves on Troi and wants to rape her. THIS is Rick Berman's idea of a great villian?<BR>Fourthly,make a Romulan film that isn't really about the Romulans. How dumb was that?<BR>Fifth,have a pointless battle where the Enterprise's weapons have all the impact of raindrops on a window pane- splat,splat,splat,thereby making the \\"battle\\" pointless.<BR>Sixth-have a clone of Picard that looks nothing like him,laughable stuff really.<BR>Seventh-have the Enterprise run out of ammo after just one battle.This ship is supposed to have 250 photon torpedeos.<BR>Eighth-Kill off Data without giving him a decent goodbye scene(as ST2 did with Spock).<BR>Let me point out how dumb this movie's plot is-if it really is that easy to beam aboard an enemy ship,then why not just leave a bomb there?<BR>When Rick Berman decided to remake ST2,he should have realised that ST2 refilmed it's ending to make it warmer and offer some hope. ST:Nemesis does not refilm and so has a cold and flat ending,a finale with no hope or charm. Data blown to bits,the end(a huge mistake).<BR>Star Trek fans are still there,we just want a decent story with ILM doing the effects again.
B00006AW2M|2.0|That was my reaction when I first heard this album for the first time in 36 years. Like most kids growing up in the 1960s', I was heavily into The Rolling Stones. It had been a long time since I'd heard &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, so I decided to check it out. After listening, I was wondering what I was listening to.<br />This record was really the band's effort to keep up with the times by cashing on the pyschedellic trend that was going on in the music industry. Before this album was released, The Beach Boys scored a # 1 hit with &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and The Beatles released &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Thinking that they too could score a successful album by recording the same genre and came up with this insipid pile of goo.<br />&quot;TSMR&quot; kicks off with the vapid &quot;Sing This All Together&quot;, which features an awful horn section and pedestrian lyrics. After that comes the droning guitars of &quot;Citadel&quot;, a lurching rocker with tasteless words and awful vocals. Bill Wyman's &quot;In Another Land&quot; can only be described by one word: odd. Featuring eerie wind sound effects, it alternates between Wyman's nasal voice narrating a futuristic romance and Mick's anger - induced vocals on the chorus. &quot;2000 Man&quot; is an acoustic guitar - driven look at the future sung through the eyes of a robot. The first half of the album screeches to a halt with a lecherous epic reprise of the &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; that seems endless.<br />The second half of the album fares better thanks to the presence of several good tracks. There are two excellent tracks here. There's the light and airy &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; and the dark, brooding space odyssey &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot;. &quot;The Lantern&quot; is also a good track, as is &quot;Gomper&quot;. The closing number, &quot;On With The Show&quot;, is quite oddly, but it slowly grows on you and you can't help but listen to it everynow and again.<br />All in all, this is not The Rolling Stones at their finest. It is a slipshod effort by the band who within 5 years time released the masterpieces &quot;Beggars' Banquet&quot;, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, &quot;Get Yer Ya - Ya's Out&quot;, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot;. However, if you do decide to check out this album, do yourself a favor and put this in a cd burner and burn yourself this cd but only include the second half.

B00004RF9I|3.0|They must have misplaced the microphones while shooting this one.  The sound editors evidently tried to salvage what had been recorded, but the end result is that in several scenes:  (i) The foreground and background sound level goes up or down by several dB each time a character bends his body by a few degrees; and (ii) The sound has that &quot;tubular&quot; quality--as if it's passing through a long, narrow tube.<br />Other than that, the film is well-done and quite humorous at times, but it's so steeped in that '70's breed of depressing cynicism as to make you wish afterward that you'd spent your last two hours doing something else.<br />The redeeming quality of the film is that it makes you glad that we survived the '70's--that decade when we thought we had known all there was to know and had done all there was to do.  And it makes you appreciate the fact that the first post-'70's head of the Fed'ral executive branch brought a contagious optimism that survives to this day.<br />The true-classic film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; gives you a similar, industry-introspective theme, better sound recording, no foul language, and a younger William Holden.  If given the choice, choose &quot;Sunset...&quot; over &quot;Network&quot;.
B000001Y9I|4.0|When guitarist and band leader Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple in 1994, many fans doubted the band's ability to continue on without him. After all, Blackmore had been the primary musical force in the band throughout their entire career, and it didn't seem that Deep Purple -- an aging hard rock band whose glory days as the founding fathers of heavy metal (along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath) were nearly 20 years behind them and who were derisively known to the general public as a &quot;dinosaur rock&quot; act -- could survive his loss. In truth, when lead singer and primary lyricist Ian Gillan assumed Blackmore's leadership responsibilities and replaced the legendary guitarist with Steve Morse, he reinvigorated Deep Purple in a way that no one could have foreseen.<br />PURPENDICULAR is Deep Purple's strongest album since their 1972 masterpiece, MACHINE HEAD. While it's true that nothing on this album is going to make Deep Purple major rock stars the way that album's &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; and &quot;Highway Star&quot; did, PURPENDICULAR should succeed in silencing the critics who had written the band off as a group of outdated dinosaurs who played only an out-of-fashion brand of stomping, arena-ready hard rock. Without the arrogant Blackmore calling the shots, Deep Purple sound like they're having more fun than they ever have. This is by far the most adventurous, eclectic album the band has ever recorded.<br />A large part of this is due to Morse. Universally lauded as one of the best (and most underappreciated) guitarists alive, Morse brings to the band a whole new world of influences that would have been horribly out-of-step with Blackmore's narrow hard rock vision. It should be noted, in Blackmore's defense, that during the group's heyday, his brilliant incorporation of classical music themes into his guitar solos set incredibly innovative new standards for hard rock guitarists, who had previously never thought to venture outside of the standard heavy-handed whiteman blues licks of Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. But Morse's ability completely eclipses his predecessor. Nothing he does on PURPENDICULAR is going to set new guitar-playing standards the way Blackmore's solos did, but his chops -- which he developed during his years as the leader of jazz-fusion pioneers the Dixie Dregs -- are far superior and more adventurous. This is a Deep Purple album that Ritchie Blackmore never could have led them to.<br />The rest of the band is in top form as well. Ian Gillan seems to have matured into his voice, with the result being his best vocal performances since the heart-stopping &quot;Child in Time.&quot; The pseudo-operatic histrionics that alternately enhanced and marred Deep Purple's classic recordings are absent here, since Gillan is no longer capable of them; what we get instead is a mature voice not unlike that of a classic bluesman, no longer trying too hard (and failing pitifully) to recapture his bombastic heavy metal screams, but still capable of producing some soaring high points that send chills down the spine (in &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming,&quot; he does just that, and he does it well). Roger Glover's bass has never been this prominent or assured; Ian Paice's drumming stretches out more than he's dared to in the past, resulting in the best stuido performances he's ever done; and Jon Lord -- no longer under pressure to provide extra heaviness to the riffs with his Hammond B3 organ -- takes a slightly more subtle approach to his instrument. While Lord doesn't disappoint with some killer organ solos that without fail eclipse their guitar-based counterparts, he also uses other keyboards to provide textures, which he's never done (at least not this well) before.<br />The real cornerstone of PURPENDICULAR is Deep Purple's most fun and adventurous set of songs. While not quite as good or consistent as MACHINE HEAD's heavy riff rockers, these songs represent new heights of creativity for the band. Gillan's lyrics -- which were occasionally straightforward (&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; and &quot;Highway Star&quot; being key examples) but usually ranged from raunchy (though you weren't sure why) to abstract to downright weird in the past -- are his most assured, which only enhances an already-strong set of songs. The most straightforward hard rockers -- album opener &quot;Ted the Mechanic,&quot; &quot;The Purpendicular Waltz,&quot; &quot;Soon Forgotten,&quot; &quot;Somebody Stole My Guitar&quot; -- aren't really straightforward at all. The aforementioned &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming&quot; is the album's centerpiece, and features a guitar theme from Morse that, if recorded in the early 70s, would today be as recognizable as Blackmore's immortal &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; riff. &quot;A Touch Away&quot; is a beautiful ballad, &quot;Hey Cisco&quot; is a fun, jazzy shuffle, and &quot;Rosa's Cantina&quot; is a great blues-rocker. But the real gem to be found here is the Scottish highlander-flavored &quot;The Aviator.&quot; Words alone cannot do justice to this song; it has to be heard to be belived.<br />Deep Purple and their die-hard fans have accepted that the band will never again be the major rock stars they were in the early '70s. But if PURPENDICULAR is any indication, their recording career still promises to be full of interesting and rewarding albums. &quot;Dinosaur rock&quot;? Hardly. That term applies to bombastic heavy metal that has long since lost its effect through being performed by old men who don't act their age. (It should be noted that not all early '70s/'80s hard rock falls into this category; a number of popular acts from that era are still capable of the same caliber performances they were in their prime.) Rock stars only &quot;get old&quot; when they refuse to mature as they age. And Deep Purple prove with this album that they have most certainly matured into a rock band still capable of equalling the recorded work of their prime.
0385504209|4.0|I had heard of all the hype about the Da Vinci Code, and finally, out of curiosity, I picked up a copy. And I was immediately drawn in.<br />the Da Vinci Code is a fast paced intricate novel of secrets. The plot is well-researched and well-written. What I did not like about the book was the poor character development. Langdon and Co. were there only as plot pushers. The main story was the Grail. I felt that when the story was over and done we didn't  know any more about Langdon than when we first started. He only sprouts information at the right moments, as with Sophie Neveu. They seemed to know everything under the sun about symbols and codes, and yet we didn't know anything more about them.<br />However, the premise was good, and that is why I give this book 4 stars.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold's &quot;Waking The Fallen&quot; CD shows the true talent of this band.  Piano, guitars, drums, bass and vocals all shine through on this disc.  Vocals are varied and keeps the entire record interesting.  The guitars are heavy yet keep a melodic groove and the rhythm section keep the paces varied and strong.  I don't rate this album a five because all songs are perfect but because all songs are enjoyable and one can listen all the way through without hitting the skip button.  This is a perfect combination of metal, hardcore and just plain hard rock.  I am also not judging this album on production which could be a bit better but does not take anything away from the talent that this band exudes.  Great CD.
B000069AUI|5.0|I first heard Coldplay in a bookstore, where I was hunting for a CD to buy. Stumped, I heard a beautiful song on the loudspeaker. I ran over to the information desk to find out what the song was, and that song was The Scientist, a true testimonal to the magic of Coldplay.<BR>Coldplay's first album Parachutes, was subtle in its pure magic and simplicity. A Rush of Blood to the Head makes the listener rediscover good music. Coldplay uses simple yet powerful words to get meaning across. Each track is impeccablt written and recorded to perfection. I think everyone can find something to like with the album. Chris Martin's voice is soft at times, and at other times powerful and insistent. His voice is paralleled with Will Champion's insistent drums, which add dimension. Guy Berryman's bass adds a subtle foundation for the song that always makes its prescence known. All of this is capped off with Jonny Buckland's wonderfully played guitar, that adds a sharp contrast to the soft piano.<BR>1. Politik. This song is more like an anthem than anything else, sending a message to the world 'give me real don't give me fake.'<BR>2. In My Place. Shows Coldplay's instruments at its best.<BR>3. God Put a Smile upon on your face: Beautiful song. The guitars are nicely played here.<BR>4. The Scientist. One of the best songs on the album. The lyrics, paired with Martin's voice and the piano, tug at your heart and pull you in.<BR>5. Clocks. Wonderfully unique song. It's very catchy and pulls you in.<BR>6. Daylight. Shows Coldplay at its best again, with the drums and guitar taking over.<BR>7. Green eyes. This song is one of the best love songs because it uses synectoche (sp?) to tell of true love. The metaphors are well used.<BR>8. Warning Sign. A very execellent song, the piano at the end is especially moving.<BR>9. A Whisper. Haven't heard this song very much, but the repeating lyrics give it importance and insistence.<BR>10. A Rush of Blood to the Head. The most powerful song on the album. This song talks of war. It's poetry at its best. Martin's soft voice gives this song excellence.<BR>11. Amsterdam. Easily the most overlooked song. Amsterdam talks about a person who's on the edge of death, it seems. The song adds the perfect cap to the album.<br />Coldplay is one of the best bands around. If you want good songs and pure sincerity, Coldplay's your ticket.<BR>10/10
0553573403|5.0|I'll admit that Martin's epic may not be for everyone.  Certainly those fantasy readers who enjoy orphan children who are secretly heirs to a kingdom and wizards who shoot fireballs from their hands will find little to love here.  But it would be a shame if you denied yourself, as a reader, the compelling read Martin offers.<br />I don't use the word compelling lightly either, this is an utterly enjoyable read.  Its quick, complex, exciting, and it defies expectations repeatedly.  In many ways it stands alone in the genre, but I wanted to highlight three virtues of this book and, by extension, the series.<br />First, the female characters are treated with respect and empathy.  Within Martin's books are princesses forced into political marriages, sisters who inadvertently do greater harm than they intend through their bickering, and mothers who are completely devoted to their children.  It's a far cry from the petulant temptresses and the masculine amazons who inhabit most other fantasy novels.<br />Second, the violence in the story carries a weight absent from most fantasy novels.  Martin captures the casual, sudden, and unexpected nature of violence.  Horrible things happen so quickly that one stops to reread sentence, almost as if, like the characters, we can hardly believe what we've just seen.  There's gut-wrenching injuries and accidents.  A character thrown from his horse breaks a leg and swoons with pain instead of hopping up to fight on.  In Martin's imagination, just as in reality, these things, these ignominious accidents, happen.<br />Finally, Martin does a fantastic job portraying magic.  The book's detractors will disagree with me strenuously here.  Martin handles magic subtly, it happens in caves and forests, in dank places where few witness it.  The use of magic is fantastic, beyond the belief of most characters in the novel.  Magic doesn't happen often.  Each time, however, it is completely memorable.<br />There are other great touches in the book.  Martin takes the time to name the games children play, uses heraldry and feudal politics extensively, and devises a clever set of  surnames for children born out of wedlock.  There are plenty of sources for high adventure as well: sworn brotherhoods, zombies, deft swordsmen, poisons, intrigues, and dragons.<br />In short, this is an absolute classic.book.

1558216847|3.0|A Polish officer whose mother was Russian, Rawicz was caught up in the Russian invasion of Eastern Poland in 1939, after escaping from the coincident German invasion of Western Poland. He eventually was sent to the Gulag, Camp 303, in the fall of 1940, and reached it in late January, 1941. The trip had begun by rail from outside Moscow in mid-November, and ended in a forty-day chained march north from Irkutsk, to within 300-400 miles of as the Arctic circle, west of Irkutsk. Most of prisoners had died by then. As with everything concerning the Gulag, all train and chain-gang operations had taken place away from habitations. <br />The Long Walk is not this chaingang trek at temperatures sometimes below -40 to camp 303, but the 4000-mile walk south which began three months later, on Easter Sunday, 1941, and brought Rawicz and a small group of escapees from the camp to the Himalayan foothills north of Calcutta 11 months later, after crossing Siberia, the Gobi desert and the Himalayas by foot. Published fourteen years later, in 1956, in English, the book is now a classic, as a Google search will attest. Unavoidably, all dates and locations are approximate at best. There are two maps. No index. <br />The original escapees from Camp 303 were seven, three Poles, a Czech, a Lithuanian, a Yugoslav and an American. At the north end of Lake Baikal they took in a girl escapee from another camp. They otherwise avoided all human contact until they were out of the USSR, and then also avoided the Chinese. Until out of the USSR, they traveled with nothing but what they began with, bags, one knife and one axe head, for which they made a handle. Later, they little but some wire. Once they reached Tibetan villages, which were much wider-spread then than they are now, they were easily given food and advice by villagers. This certainly accounts for their survival.<br />Nevertheless, they travelled under conditions of nearly constant hunger, and for months under conditions of great thirst. Two members, one man and the girl, were lost to scurvy when crossing the Gobi. The Lithuanian died of sheer exhaustion near Lhasa, and one man dropped into an abyss when climbing down from the Himalayas. They were four to reach Calcutta and the English army, and all four then lost about a month to insanity, so that what we have here is one man's tale from memory after this episode. <br />Primo Levi tells of a minority of &quot;Moslems&quot; in the concentration camps who simply resigned themselves to their lot, and soon died. In Rawicz's case, the &quot;Moslems&quot; would have died before reaching the camp. Simply surviving that first walk, and then three months of Gulag, certainly drove some detainees into a single-purpose frame of mind, the opposite of the &quot;Moslem&quot; attitude,  which steeled them to escape. Rawicz and a friend recruited their companions on this criterion, a &quot;beyond reason&quot; drive to get out, and they chose well.<br />They were most lucky in following an indication (from the wife of the camp commander, who held the post as a form of punishment) that they should go south, while all detainees thought of going west back to Russia, or East to the Pacific. Both directions led to certain death or recapture. By the time they reached Lake Baikal, about a quarter of the way, the group had melded itself into a unit whose one command was to walk, walk, walk. The month of insanity at the end was the price paid to recover their ordinary sanity from these nine months of total singleness of purpose. <br />As told, the tale can neither be documented nor confirmed by anyone. If the book is true, it is a testimony to a feat of the human will. <br />But, perhaps because of the single-mindedness that was needed to live to tell the tale, it is not a very deep story, sticking to the kind of events one would record in a log, and especially poor in physiological observations. The Long Walk cannot compare with, for instance, The Worst Journey in the World. The problem is not that it is bare-bones reporting, which it is, but that the reporting centers on chaining simple objective events, as if the author was searching his memory less for what he lived and what shaped him, than for a police report.<br />There is a note at the start that Ronald Downing &quot;helped [Rawicz] write the book.&quot; The English is competent if slightly out-of-tune. On p. 117 there is a repeated naming error that no one named Rawicz would commit, hopefully the deed of an overactive copy editor for this edition. Several parts of the book beggar belief, such as crossing the Gobi without any water reserve. Worst of all is the careful observation by the entire group of a Yeti couple (in this case, bear-like beings standing on two legs for half an hour, without protuding ears, larger than humans). In the place where the Yeti were observed, even mere humans lacked any food source. Most unexplainable, though, is the Yetis' behavior as reported by Rawicz.<br />Crediting a trick of memory would be easier if the entire book was not so devoid of simple daily feelings. In the thirties England had celebrated  &quot;Grey Owl&quot;, an English writer passing himself off as a Canadian metis. In 1956, with &quot;The Third Eye&quot;, it was starting  twenty years of the tales of a worse fake, Lobsang Rampa, a &quot;Tibetan monk&quot; who was up to then a London plumber. There is nothing in The Long Walk that could not be assembled from books published by 1956, although the Gulag description (minus the camp commander's wife and the easy recruitment of a perfect group) is a remarkably good report in English for the time.

B00006CXSS|5.0|My father was 22 years old when he left Philadelphia and joined the army in the spring of 1942 he volunteered for the 101st, in the summer of 1942 he left Philadelphia and found himself at Camp Toccoa, he was not in Easy Company, I don't know the name of his company.<br />He was a sergeant and squad leader he named his squad &quot;Maguire's Magpies&quot;.  He fought in France, Holland and Bastogne. Out of the original squad of 12 that landed in Normandy only 4 men survived the war, 8 men were killed in action during the following twelve months. And 6 of the replacements were killed in action as well.  He himself received 2 Purple Hearts, the original squad and the replacements endured 150% casualities.<br />My father died in 1988 so he'll never read the book, or see Band of Brothers.  When I was young I would pump him for information about the war, he told me everything. We discussed his experience at length, over the years he told me all the details. So much so, that when I read the Ambrose book it was like I had already read the book.  But I wasn't prepared for the visual images in the Band of Brothers, I was overwhelmed, the intensity and the brutality of what my father and his fellow soldiers experienced brought me to tears. This production is a fitting tribute to the ultimate sacrifices that these young men made.  <br />My father traveled to Europe for business frequently in the 60's and 70's. He would take time on this trips to visit France, Holland and Belgium, he would locate that certain village, and find that particular farm field or forest where one of his &quot;brothers&quot; had fallen, he never forgot how special and exceptional these young men were.<br />My father is still the most exceptional human being I have known in my life, seeing this production gave me a great insight to his personality. He was a person who truly appreciated what life had to offer, he was active, loving, funny and always emphasized the positive.  Those thirteen months in 1944-45, gave him an understanding of humanity that few of us possess.
0679745653|5.0|Like many readers, my first encounter with Breakfast At Tiffany's the book came after seeing the movie. The two have so much in common that it's difficult to separate them in my mind; the movie benefits from having Audrey Hepburn on the screen a lot in some nice costumes, but suffers from Blake Edwards' typical racial stereotyping, with its transformation of Mr Yunioshi into a bad joke.<br />But then, Audrey was in the story when I read it, too, so closely did her portrayal match the written character. It's rather difficult to believe that Capote favoured Marilyn Monroe for the part (as he is reported to have done) -- Hepburn even looks like the character described in the story, while Monroe doesn't.<br />Despite the similarities, there are some interesting differences too, which I won't list here, as discovering them will be part of the fun of the book for anyone who's seen the movie.<br />The story is of the narrator's relationship with his neighbour Holly Golightly, proceeding from glimpses on the stairs, to passing acquaintance, to volatile friendship, and finally to unrequited love, and loss. But the real subject of the book is the unfolding of Holly's character and past.<br />The book comes alive when Holly is in the room; she is one of the great memorable characters of modern fiction, and most readers will probably fall in love with her a little.<br />Also included in the edition I read (and most editions, so far as I can tell) are three short stories by Capote: 'House of Flowers', about a Haitian prostitute; 'A Diamond Guitar', set in a Southern prison; and 'A Christmas Memory', the narrator's (possibly Capote's own) reminiscences of a childhood friend. I wonder how many readers stop when they finish Breakfast? The other three stories are good enough, but lack the greatness of Breakfast. But then, so do most things.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|Many people, especially critics and those of the priveleged class, misunderstand this film, which is of great significance to many places in the United States, especially Los Angeles.  Scarface is a work of art through and through, with Al Pacino giving an excellent and inspired performance in one of his best roles.  He is utterly convincing in the role of a Cuban druglord, not only in his passion, but also in terms of his accent and mannerisms; he seems quite authentic as a Latino.  The story, which is rooted in true history, is of Tony Montana, a poor Cuban immigrant who comes to the shores of Florida via Mariel boatlift in the early 1980's and, through the circulation and distribution of cocaine, rises to the rank of drug kingpin.  Besides being a classic rags-to-riches story, the film is an excellent example of character study.  There are numerous subtle clues that indicate the difficulty Tony encountered most of his life, being that his father left him and his family when he was still growing up as well as the fact that he had holes in his shoes at the time of his arrival on U.S. soil, a symbol of his poverty.  Besides this, he has other strikes against him: he is a Latino, a person of color who speaks English with an accent, and he is marked by a scar on his face, causing society to presume that he is a criminal; this is evident by the opening scene, in which he is immediately interrogated by the police and locked up in a cage known as \\"Freedom Town.\\"  Getting a green card was also a difficult feat for him, involving brutal foul play.  On top of that, his first job is that of a dishwasher alongside his friend/partner/brother Manny Ray, an occupation that only pays the bills if one is lucky.  It is obvious that Montana represents the underclass as a whole.  Given all of this, it is no wonder that he chooses to become a part of the cocaine empire, which exemplifies something which many people can respect: Tony Montana came from nothing, and he rose all the way to the top-- this is the main reason why many gangsta rap artists respect and empathize with him.  Unfortunately, he brought himself down in one major way: getting high on his own supply.  Scarface is loaded with many complicated elements that make it a great film, and all the while, the audience is cheering for Tony; this is largely out of empathy for his difficult past, as life has really backed him into a corner, but also because he embodies morality in many ways: he is loyal, courageous, and a man of his word.  Another interesting tidbit is that despite the roughness of his trade, he never kills innocents.  Al Pacino certainly outdid himself with this one, but his is not the only memorable performance; Stephen Bauer is perfect as Manny Ray, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio manages to convey a haunting innocence as Gina, Tony's younger sister.  There is no bad acting throughout the film, and the balance of realism, drama, comedy (there is a certain humor present in Tony and Manny throughout most of the film), and action, of which there is plenty, is well-maintained.  Yes, Scarface is a very bloody film, but it is a reality for some.  All should view it; it is definitely an eye-opener.
B00000099Y|5.0|This was, in fact, the first parental advisory CD that I EVER BOUGHT.  I remember ordering it from BMG (don't worry, amazon...t'was loooong before I even HAD the internet...) and not realizing that it was parental advisory.  I had seen the video for Stinkfist (or, &quot;song #1&quot;, as they called it...why I don't know to this day) and fell in LOVE.  It was the COOLEST video EVER, it was the COOLEST SONG ever...it was just amazing.  My parents saw it was parental advisory when it arrived in the mail and took it away.  I was pissed off and went out to go on with my life (a.k.a. mow the grass...come on...I was ~14), and when I came back inside, it was laying on my bed.  Turns out my dad saw past that stupid ass sticker after listening to it.  He's always liked Soundgarden and STP and Metallica and so on and just generally been pretty cool when it comes to music.  He loved the CD too.  Since then, I've worn out and had stolen 3 damn copies of it and I'm currently on my fourth.  And if something were to happen to this one, you can rest ASSURED that I WILL get another.  I have them all...except the elusive Salival, of which my best friend has...bought it for 30 or 40 bucks or what ever when it was in the stores...rubs my nose in it to this day.  Anyone that reads this knows where I can pick one up at a reasonable price, or just wants to talk about music, lemme know.  AOL Instant Messenger screen name:  rmp5sxxx.

B0000VAFO0|1.0|There are certain genre conventions with vampires and werewolves.  Like the fact that they are hard to kill.  At one point in this movie a vampire passes out from blood loss due to a stab wound from an ordinary knife.  Please.  While this is the most egregious disappointment, it is certainly not the only one.  The movie plays more like a Hong Kong gunfest than a vamp or werewolf movie.  Werewolves were only identifiable when they (rarely) chose to wolf-out.  Vampires weren't really identifiable at all, except perhaps for the one occasion when a vamp bit someone.  And why are werewolves running on walls and ceilings?!  The only good things about this movie are the leather outfits.

B00005OAIE|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs of the last few years. I have to admit that I didn't like him at first and wrote him off to another teeny bopper, albeit one that had talent and could play an instrument. It wasn't until &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; was released that I listened to his whole album and was blown away.  Yes, a lot of his lyrics are really simplistic, but I like it that way.  He creates a world that is easy to understand with his words and while listening to most of the songs on the album, I felt that I could have written the songs myself had I thought of the idea first. His lyrics for me were very easy to empathize with and because of that, I think I fell in love with not only the words, but everything about the songs themselves.  Sure, there may be no real deep meaning in his lyrics, but sometimes, the simple things in life are the best.
B000001ELR|4.0|In retrospect, Creatures Of The Night is a preview of what I call the heavy metal tryptych consisting of Lick It Up, Animalize, and Asylum.  One thing's for sure, KISS finally decided to listen to its fans and make the album they had promised, the heaviest KISS album ever.  Well, that wouldn't be until 1984's Animalize, but Creatures was a start in that direction, thanks to some thunderous drums from the Fox and a new fiery guitar from the Pharaoh, Vinnie Vincent, who has co-writing credits on three songs.<br />The title track is a definite sign that a heavier sound is in the making, with the song having a theme of underdogs by day being winners at night.<br />&quot;Saints And Sinners&quot; has Gene's demonic voice there, and evidence of Vinnie Vincent's guitar, a different but still great contrast from Ace's trademark licks, and one that would really come into fruition on Lick It Up.  Telling off a goody-two shoes woman has never been so great&quot;Kiss my heart bye-bye/and I don't need no one at all.&quot;<br />The loud anthemic braggadocio of a female conquest in &quot;Keep Me Comin'&quot; shows KISS having lost none of its another-notch-on-the-belt 'tude.<br />Then comes one of two songs written by Gene Simmons, with assistance from Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance(!!)  &quot;Rock And Roll Hell&quot; describes the plight of a rocker burned out, trapped by the music game, wanting to scrabble up to #1.<br />The protagonist in &quot;Danger&quot; seems to be one burning the candle at both ends, grabbing life by the throat, and thundering drums and Vincent's guitarwork mirrors the frantic life:  &quot;Oh I wanna know/how far to go/takin' my life in my hands/out on my own/fighting alone/call me the desperate man.&quot;<br />The next three songs were co-written by Vinnie Vincent.  First up, those familiar anthemic drums, chants, and Gene's power vocals come into play on the heavy metal anthem &quot;I Love It Loud.&quot;  Given how acts like Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne were blazing the metal trail in the late 70's and to that point, the title mirrored the demands of KISS's fans who demanded something louder and heavier.<br />&quot;I Still Love You&quot; starts out in a quiet and tender way like &quot;Beth&quot;, but the guitar rises to a heavy metal wave in the chorus.  One of the few serious love songs KISS did since &quot;Beth.&quot;<br />Quick Sabbath-like riffs figure in &quot;Killer&quot; of a woman who's got more than a sadistic edge, and who better than Gene to sing about her?  &quot;Watch out for your jugular/she's a killer/animal with a twisted brain/she's a killer!&quot;  Gulp, I think.  This is a precursor to Gene singing about similar woman in Animalize (&quot;Burn B-tch Burn&quot;) and Asylum (&quot;Secretly Cruel&quot;)<br /> Heavy Sabbath-like riffs that Danzig's guitarist might have appropriated in &quot;Snakes of Christ&quot; frame &quot;War Machine&quot;, the second song co-written by Adams and Vallance.  This is closest to an anti-war song as KISS got by singing from the POV of a totalitarian-minded warmonger:  &quot;Take the reins of power and seize them/draw the battle lines/Armageddon's just a matter of time/tear down the voice of reason/let the arrows fly/your freedom's just a state of mind, yeah.&quot;  Hmm, was this song played by the people who wrote the Patriot Act?<br />The first step in revamping KISS into a heavy metal machine, a step that would reach its maximum in Animalize.  Their next album though, should've been titled after their 1980 album, given what the album cover showed, but I already told that story.ere blazing the metal trail in the late 70's and to that point, the title mirrored the demands of KISS's fans who demanded something louder and heavier.<br />&quot;I Still Love You&quot; starts out in a quiet and tender way like &quot;Beth&quot;, but the guitar rises to a heavy metal wave in the chorus.

0316666343|5.0|I don't often read contemporary fiction that isn't science fiction or fantasy, but this book was more than worth it.  When I finished, I passed it on to my daughter (who's 15), who loved it and lent it to a friend of hers when she was done.  The narrator, Susie Salmon, is a murdered 14-year old girl in Heaven, observing her family and friends as well as her murderer on earth.  The premise sounds morbid, but the book is compelling and appealing in many ways.  A lot of the appeal has to do with Susie's voice as she describes her experience of Heaven and her observations of her family and friends as they try to cope with their grief and find a way go on with life.  We see Susie's characterization fully fleshed out as she reveals her love for her family as well as her regrets for the life experiences she'll never have.  At the same time she has a kind of wry humor and growing insight as she learns more about the the flaws and virtues of the people she observes.  The other characters are also very well-developed even to the older brother of Susie's sister's boyfriend.  The novel is  starkly realistic yet humane in its point-of-view, and it is infused with magic at the same time.  As my daughter said, the novel is very original, the characters are well-rounded and you can't help caring about them, and the opening paragraph is so gripping that one can't help wanting to keep reading.
B00001OH7V|4.0|Phase two of the Low-Heroes-Lodger tryptych during Bowie's Berlin period, collaboration with Roxy Music's Brian Eno, you name it.  The musicians here other than Eno are Carlos Alomar (rhythm guitar), Dennis Davis (percussion) and George Murray (electric bass).  Lead guitar honors go to King Crimson's Robert Fripp.  As with Low, part of the album contains vocal songs, the other haunting instrumentals coming from Bowie's observations of Berlin from the Hansa by the Wall studio.<br />The dark and brooding mood from \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" comes from the prominent electronic noises courtesy of Eno.  This got to only #39 on the UK charts.<br />The wall of noise, mainly the guitars, in \\"Joe The Lion\\" evokes a dazed dreamworld of Berlin, based in part on Bowie's observations of a city of disillusioned people, but also the antics of an American performance artist named Chris Burden, which included the \\"tell you who you are if you nail me to my car\\" line.  But the line \\"get up and sleep\\" does have a weird dreamland-type atmosphere.<br />Then the title song, a #24 hit on the UK chart, and one of Bowie's most anthemic and inspiring songs.  The inspiration came from a couple having a forbidden sort of affair by the Wall, and that despite the presence of the Soviet occupation, that \\"we can be heroes just for one day.\\"  The triumph of their togetherness is taken later when gunshots are fired above their heads while they kiss:  \\"And the shame was on the other side/Oh we can beat them for ever and ever.\\"<br />The droning sound on \\"Sons Of The Silent Age\\" echo the numb hopelessness of a generation who \\"don't walk, just glide in and out of life/they never die, just go to sleep one day.\\"  The chorus has a message of hope for those who isn't a son of the silent age.<br />\\"Blackout\\" could've been a good single what with its insistent drums and danceable beat.<br />Then come the instrumentals.  \\"V-2 Schneider\\" has a strange droning organ-like sound which leads into upbeat sax-like notes, with Bowie crooning the title.  V-2's were of course the aerial terror weapons Hitler used in the last stages of WW2, called doodlebugs by the Brits.  Schneider refers to Kraftwerk keyboardist Florian Schneider, whom Bowie had a rapport with.<br />With a rustling sea and four notes on the way left-hand side of the piano, the haunting and oppressively gloomy \\"Sense Of Doubt\\" with some keyboard synths that conjures up a wasteland or futuristic city the same way.  And the melancholy this evokes makes \\"Art Decade\\" and \\"Subterraneans\\" from Low as peppy as an Altered Images song.  My favourite Bowie instrumental period.<br />Bowie uses the koto, a 13-stringed Japanese rectangular instrument along with Eno's synths to evoke the timeless wonder of a \\"Moss Garden,\\" which in Japan is used as a place of contemplative meditation.  Kokedera in Kyoto is one example of a moss garden.  At times, a sound like an airplane flying overhead can be heard.<br />\\"Neukoln\\" is the name of the Turkish quarter in Berlin, where the Turks live in appalling housing and misery, much like the immigrants photographed in the 1880's by Jacob Riis.  Bowie's sax is distorted and wailing, overlaid with some oppressive Eno keyboards.<br />The final track is a vocal song, \\"The Secret Life of Arabia,\\" built around uptempo drums and funky bassline.<br />The instrumentals alone are worth buying this album, as is the title track and the last song.  As good as Low, demonstrating that Bowie's time with Brian Eno was among the best spent in his career, but that of Berlin was very emotionally haunting.with Bowie crooning the title.

0385504209|4.0|It is a page turner and very smartly written.  The research is excellent and opens a whole tract of thought about religion and women.  In fact, not being trained in Christian culture and history all that well, it was difficult for me to distinguish genuine historical facts from Dan Brown's fiction many times, which made it all the more interesting.  Of course, many of the ideas and research may have been taken from other body of work, but that does not take from the novel in any way.  My only gripe is that, from the very beginning, it became clear that the author had Hollywood in mind for this work.  The chapters are organized in scenes, and the pace is fast and furious, as in many of the current block busters.  In the second half of the book, the endless turn of events, and how the heros always managed to extract themselves from all kinds of impossible situations became a little too much. A highly entertaining and somewhat thought provoking book, well written and well worth it.

B00000099Y|5.0|If you like to be spoon fed than you will not like Tool. You will get frustrated and never listen to the cd again. But it may be the point to weed out the simple-minded. The way Tool leaves the music so vague is great for the fans who are willing to be vulnerable (a favorite word of the band). You can take any song, listen to what's going on and there really isn't one meaning. I think the point is to listen to the music  enough to where your sub-conscious takes over and you feel what is going on, not just hearing what is going on, and then applying it to your own reality. Sure these songs all mean something to Maynard but he wants the fans to feel what the song means to each one individually. <br />Not to mention he is probably doing society a favor by making people use their brains every once in awhile. The whole cd kind of molds into one song which is really cool. I'd say Jimmy is my favorite, maybe of any cd ever made. Its fits my description moreso than any song I can think of.
B00005JMCN|2.0|Toby McGuire was not impressive in this movie. As far as I can remember, the acting was okay, but Toby just doesn't fit the charector of a jockey.<BR>I am a huge lover of horses and at first couldn't wait to see it, but when I did I was dissapointed. Not only was it relatively dull and boring, but my cousin and I started laughing out loud when we saw two horses being put in a stall together. Anyone who knows horses would know this is absolutely disasterous. This just goes to show that the movie was innacurate and made by someone who doesn't know equines. <br />There is nothing outstanding about this movie, don't waste your time.
079070546X|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation will without a doubt become a Christmas classic on viewer's lists.  Viewing this film is a great way to relieve tension during the holiday season.  With his usual enthusiasm Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) sets out to have a fun old-fashioned family Christmas in this sequel to the Vacation movies.   Cousin Eddie once again played by Dennis Quaid does his part to help.  Beverly D'Angelo is back as Ellen, Clark's wife, who struggles to make everything work smoothly.   In true National Lampoon style this film is a funny look at family traditions and holiday events.  With a house full of relatives, decorations and animals the Griswolds once again turn the magic of the moment into a hilarious situation.
B00005JKJA|1.0|After watching Mulhulland Drive, I feel like I just completely wasted over two hours of my life.  There is absolutely no plot, characters are introduced, never to be heard from again, while others change identities at the end of the movie.  I felt like I was watching &quot;Bewitched&quot; when they switched Darren's and didn't tell anyone.<BR>I know everyone says it's an extremely intelligent movie, one you have to think about.  If you're looking for an intelligent movie, watch &quot;Momento&quot;.  That movie had an extremely complicated storyline that jumped back and forth at a moments notice, but it at least made sense once the credits rolled.<BR>I will admit that &quot;Mullholland Drive&quot; is a beautifully shot movie, and well acted.  Naomi Watts gives us a glimpse of her talent that will bless us for years to come.  Unfortunately, the cinematographer &amp; actors where given a horrendous script.  I can see how this would work as a TV series, it's intended destination.  It is very &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, with possibilities in every direction.  Just don't try to take what was supposed to be an introduction to a 13 episode series &amp; make a 2 hour movie out of it.  One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

0679720200|5.0|I usually don't write many reviews, but I felt an exigency to write one in light of some of the reviews on The Stranger. Even those who have praised it seem to have missed out on Camus' message, the message which revolves around all of his work. Mearsault is not meant to symbolize some sort of alienated, misfit, product of society like many have said. Camus is not Kafka and Meursault is not Gregor Samsa. The \\"indifference of the world\\" is not something which is holding Meursault down, but rather showing him the true naked beauty of the world- one with lack of explanations and reason. The absurd is what arises when man's search for meaning in life is met by the truth that there is no meaning. This is not bad and it is not good, it simply is. Perhaps, a read of the Myth of Sisyphus might help make these ideas clearer and make The Stranger truly appreciated.
B00006LIRI|5.0|This was the first U2 cd that I listened to. This cd is the reason that I have now been out and bought every single one of their albums. I see here a lot of fans saying that these are not U2's best songs and now that I've heard the rest of their albums, I agree. But when I first bought this cd, I didn't know that! I listened to this, and I instantly loved nearly every song. Thats what this cd is about, in my opinion. Its a gateway for new fans to start listening to U2. Its not a compilation of U2's best songs, Its's a compilation of U2's easiest songs to listen to.<br />Achtung Baby is a brilliant album but it's such a complex album that it's not one i loved right away. Having  listened to this though, I knew how great U2 was and I had the faith in them to keep listening to it, and pretty soon I was hooked.<br />That's what a lot of fans who already had all their albums don't quite understand. They already know how great U2 is, they don't need this. This is a new fans cd.<br />Thats why I don't listen to it much anymore, (except for songs like Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill me and Miss Sarejevo, which I don't have) because I'm not a new fan anymore, but when I was, I was literally listening to it all the time.<br />This album isn't getting the reviews that it deserves. Thats why I give it a 5/5.
B000089RVX|2.0|I got to know Evanescence by some MP3's on MP3.com and I was like &quot;WOW&quot;. So, haling from The Netherlands, I ordered their first album Origin. The mixture from Gothic rock, and some metal influences had something special.<br />So when word came oud that there was going to be an new album, I was really curious.<br />It turned out to be very disappointing. All the refreshing and experimental influences were gone and the musical direction had turned to a direction I don't like that much.<br />To put it in another way: They sound like Linkin park with a female vocalist. Well, there are enough clones of linkin park already.<br />Is fallen that bad? No. It's high quality music, but it's nothing special. Please return to the old sound.
B0000AI45P|4.0|And the best CBGB rock band from the late seventies is... Talking Heads. But this album definatly deserves merit. I was a little let down by it when I first listened, but a few more and it grew on me. But at times it kind of just sounds like early eighties arena rock. That was my only problem with it. But yes, the bonus material does kind of ruin the mood. I listen to full albums regardless of what format I listen to out of respect for the artist. But it's worth you money. Buy it, enjoy it.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|It seems that anything to do with &quot;Lord of thr Rings&quot; is large, grandiose and unabashedly epic.  But everything to do with Peter Jacksons' incredible trilogy is permeated by a sense of earnestness and sincerity that wrench at our heartstrings and makes up love &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; that much more.  Composer Howard Shore is no exception.  His score is cinematic and musical gold, the perfect musical vision of Tolkeins' mythical Middle Earth.  Shore with his final entry in the trilogy shows just why he was chosen for such a project, as he has on &quot;Fellowship&quot; and &quot;Towers.&quot;  His theme for Gondor has as much brassy power as the Rohan while the cut &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot; captures Frodos' sense of terror as he encounters the giant spider.  On every track, Shore finds the emotions within the listener to reveal what is happening in the story.  &quot;Ride of The Rohirrim&quot; gloriously envisions 6000 calvalry in full gallop, &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot; watches the suicidal mission of Faramir to recapture Osgilliath while his father sits in luxury.  But not to be outdone, Annie Lennox lends her contributions to the hopeful and luminous &quot;Into the West,&quot; which combines her otherworldly vocals with soft acoustic guitar, harmonic horns and beautiful lyrics to sieze the feeling of seeing the Elven ships pass into Valinor, the undying land.  This score is a triumph.  Howard Shore is a master.
B0000DD79B|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel are a true  American original.  They are clearly the best folk duet of all time and created so many great songs over just seven years!  Maybe just a touch of Dylan influence on some their 1964 songs, but not too much.  They always had their own unique sound and voice.  These two CD's do them righteous justice. <br />Terrific sound and a nice job of remastering on several of the tracks.  I especially like 'If I Could&quot; and &quot;My Little Town.&quot;  But the quintessential song, &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; the timeless masterpiece, soars above all the others.<br />Perhaps the only negative aspect of their songs was that many of them barely topped 2 minutes, and are really too short.  But let's face it, it was the era of 45's and brief-AM-static-filled radio play.  Too bad.  It took some doing in the late 60's and early 70's to create FM rock which was so much better.  Oh well. <br />Enjoy.
B00006AW2F|4.0|This album of recordings the Stone's didn't feel were good enough to release in the 60s and early 70s, released against their wishes in 1975, does more to prove their greatness than they ever could have imagined.<br />Because this is classic, classic stuff. It sounds like the Stones' Motown record: \\"Out of Time\\" is amazing, and the rest of the album, with a few minor exceptions, is a fine reminder of what great Rock & Roll was once all about.<br />I foolishly bought this CD and a newer Stones record, the live NO SECURITY, from 1998, on the same day. What an eye opening experience. METAMORPHASIS was supposed to be a throw-away to fulfill a dying contract, while NO SECURITY was designed as a big, live, 'come back' record following an extensive tour. But there's more rockin' in \\"Don't Lie To Me,\\" a virtually forgotten tune on side one of METAMORPHASIS, than on all of the newer live record combined. METAMORPHASIS is playing on my stereo right now; NO SECURITY is in the trash can.<br />They were a great band--for a stretch they were living up to their 'Greatest Rock and Roll Band On Earth' label--and now a shadow image of the old kings tours endlessly, slowly getting worse and worse in old age.<br />The version of \\"Heart of Stone\\" isn't the classic version released on 45--those were the little records singles came out on in the stone age, teeny boppers--and a lot of this stuff sounds different than most classic Stones LPs. More American, to tell the truth--there are obvious Motown and even Beach Boys influences running through this record and, in the second half, the sounds of EXILE ON MAIN STREET and BEGGAR'S BANQUET begin to creep in. <br />It's a great, great record that far too few people have heard.
0061015725|3.0|The science behind this is really interesting.  It makes my mind soar considering all the possibilities that the technology discussed in this book evokes.<br />However, the plot was predictable, except for a few silly surprises that seemed to have no relationship with the rest of the story - like one of the characters has a car accident for no particular reason.<br />The relationship of the husband and wife depicted in this story is thin, predictable, and boring.<br />Overall the book has a cool premise and a silly plot.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Depp is great as Ed Wood, the B-movie director who exclaims \\"Perfect!  That's a cut!\\" at the end of every first take.  Depp pulls off a dumb perky earnestness that makes the viewer believe that Ed Wood really believes his takes are perfect.  He keeps making horrible movies, but somehow he keeps getting chances to make more movies; it's almost a modern day Candide.<br />Martin Landau is utterly convincing as Bela Lugosi, the rest of the cast is perfect, and there's a gigantic rubber octopus as well as Bill Murray as the ruler of the galaxy.  A movie as funny and charming as this one should've been released on DVD long ago, but it looks like the studio keeps setting a date and pulling it.  I was going to buy this the day it came out, but now I'm going to have to wait and hope again!  I'd get the VHS, but the deleted scenes and commentary on the DVD would really be something to see.
B00005JMFO|3.0|Being English i found this film funny but it definitley had some things it could do with out..if your still not sure i would consider renting it when it comes out on dvd..
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Who does earnest better than Bowie?  I shelved this album soon after buying it.  It just didn't click with me with the immediacy that Heathen or Hours did.  I soon came back to Reality, and unlike Heathen or Hours, I found Reality to have more staying power.  I still like certain songs from Hours and Heathen, but I find myself skipping around more on those discs than any other Bowie disc.  Most artists carve out their niche in the music industry, and they become valuable product.  AC/DC has their core audience. That audience knows what to expect from their group and AC/DC always delivers with their three-chord anthems that stomp.  These groups/singers lose their relevance over time and become jokes.  It has to be difficult to remain relevant over a 30 year career, but Bowie has done it to a degree that continues to amaze those of us who have followed his multi-colored career.  There are 14 eclectic albums that David Bowie has made that I consider incredible, and this one fits into that group nicely
0780020685|5.0|I don't know what to say about all those who has rated this movie with four stars or less.. I would have get my taste of understanding and my perspective of seeing checked, if I were you. Since it's not possible to do it yet, i could do nothing but wish you good luck with the rest of your life..
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Many Trek fans consider #5 the worst in the series (although I do not)  Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell exactly why that is.  There are lots of good parts.  The plot could have been taken directly out of the Original Series (albeit the 3rd season).  To wit: a renegade Vulcan and his band of followers takes over the Enterprise in order to find the Creator of the Universe (conveniently located beyond the \\"Great Barrier\\" at the centre of our own galaxy; apparently a different Great Barrier than that in \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" located at the edge of the galaxy).  But, for some reason, the good parts just don't fit together.  <br />Firstly, there's the idiotic ease with which the Enterprise is commandeered by the rebels.  Next there is the over-emoted acting (the blame for this has to fall on Shatner's shoulders - the self-proclaimed \\"hammeister\\").  The effects are sub-par, in relation to the rest of the series.  But is it the worst Trek?  I'd say not.  When compared to the plot stupidities of Nemesis, this film is practically high art.  And I didn't like Insurrection either.<br />There are ample reasons for buying this DVD, not the least of which is that the compulsive collector should have all the Special Edition Trek films in his/her library.  But beyond that is the sheer scope and quality of the extras.  Okuda's text commentary is fun and trivia-filled, as usual.  Footage of the orginal ending (Kirk being attacked by rock-monsters) is interesting.  There are some neat original promotional material - trailers, a press conference, etc.  I certainly recommend this DVD, even if I can't recommend the film.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Three discs of the DT repertoire up until Scenes From a Memory.  It is a good representation of their music without playing the same set as Once in a Live Time.  The album begins with Scenes From a Memory and weaves its way in and out of solos until the fitting conclusion of Learning to Live.  Also if this album is put in your CD-Rom it will display two clips from the Jordan Rudess Solo and Another Day not featured on the DVD that can be bought of this live performance.
B000089RVR|5.0|This disc has everything going for it: good lyrics, great melodies and an even greater vocalist. Pick it up soon- you won't regret it!!!
B000056TKD|5.0|This really is one of the best &quot;Planets&quot; I've ever heard, if not THE best.  The transition from the cruel, marching onslought of Mars, to the lush, welcoming orchestral sweetness and warmth of Venus is the most touching bridge you can hear placed between such opposing musical ideas.  And the other movements continue to bring the listener further and further inward.  The music really is astounding.  The only thing that I really don't understand here is why Steinberg chose to be so sloppy with his Mars tempos.  In fact, Mars is the only section here that really bothers me.  It doesn't pack the usual emotional weight, because you don't get the subtle undertones of fear and dread in the build-up.  In fact, there are moments when the orchestra sounds completely arrhythmic, like they themselves don't know where they should be at the moment.  I don't understand those reviewers who say that a faster Mars makes for a more exciting Mars.  I couldn't disagree more, but that's just my opinion.  Still, it's a wonderful piece of music, and a great recording despite its flaws.  Jupiter (my personal favorite movement of the piece) truly is played with jollity.  I almost imagine a drunken, giddy banquet, interspersed with brief moments of solemnity and brotherhood.  Saturn truly creaks and wheezes with the rheumatism and meandering sentiment of old age.  Uranus sizzles with magical meanness and mischief, and Neptune sparkles with mysterious promise, beckoning us from the depths of the unknown.  Plus, a wonderful placement of Richard Strauss' &quot;Thus Spake Zarathustra&quot; rounds out the package, making this disc choc-full of content at over seventy-five minutes long!  How much more star-gazing could you ask for?  The Planets were truly in allignment when Steinberg recorded this one.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is, quite simply, brilliant.  Computer animation has come on in leaps and bounds since the days of Toy Story (1995) and Finding Nemo stunningly attests to this.  From the vibrantly coloured and gently undulating coral on the reef, to the murky depths of Sydney harbour, to the clever use of reflection and refraction off the fish tank, this is a film in which the constantly changing scenery is a large part of its attraction.  The original and well-judged score enhances the viewer's sense of wonder and their empathy with the characters.<br />But computer wizardry alone cannot create a great film.  Finding Nemo is also blessed with an action-packed story and lots of laughs (largely courtesy of Dory - a well-meaning blue tang fish with short-term memory loss).  Nemo is a young clown fish, eager to test his boundaries, who is caught by a diver and taken to an aquarium in Sydney.  Whilst there, he makes friends with a motley collection of aquatic creatures who help him plot his escape.  Meanwhile, his over-protective father, Marlin, begins a frantic quest to find his son.  Along the way he is helped and hindered by three new-age sharks, some bodacious-dude turtles, a whale, and a monstrous angler fish (amongst others).<br />And yes, the ending may be a little mushy, but after such an epic adventure, the viewer will find the sentimentality relatively easy to stomach.  Indeed, the character development is surprisingly deep for a children's movie, and it's a nice change to have not every character being entirely good or bad.  Parents in the audience will certainly identify with Marlin's dilemma of wanting to protect his child, and yet coming to realise that the time comes when one has to let go a little.
0340178221|4.0|Auguste Rodin,sculptor;this biography reads with force and energy and somehow gives without the sacrifice of accuracy a wonderful tale of a great artists life. Self directed and dedicated a lover of many women,Rodin's story is both interesting and entertaining. To appreciate great art one must try to know the artist. This book attempts to do just that. A little like a novel,with lots of dialoque but worth your time.
6305451591|5.0|The style used by Roberto Benigni is NOT what most USA movie watchers are used to experiencing and it therefore is lost on a few that just don't 'get it'.  Gladly, reading other reviews here, I see that many others did understand so I guess there is still  some hope for us all.  <br />This is NOT a comedy!  The comedy is merely a device in the main character's personality.  He is a like-able, totally open, free spirited clown of sorts and I believe that the purpose of using a character like that is  simply to disarm the audience; you simply cannot have any malice toward this man.  That is where this film is far different than a movie like Schindler's list where you get to know the mind of Schindler but learn very little about the real personalities and thoughts of those he saves. <br />So, watch this movie and BE disarmed.  99% of this movie is a painting in progress; you just have to let go and wait while it is being painted before your eyes right up until the last few minutes of the film where Benigni finally reveals his intended message. With his painting now completed before you, be prepared three rapid fire emotional blows to your brain. The last and greatest one being only a few spoken words to reveal something that ought to leave you balling like a baby.  If not - watch AND LISTEN to it again..

0743201140|4.0|\\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O.<BR>Clifton is a fun and useful read. The premise is that we spend<BR>too much time trying to understand and repair our weaknesses when<BR>we should instead be developing our natural strengths.<br />The Gallup International Research &amp; Education Center developed a<BR>strengths profile based on psychological information gathered<BR>over many years of study. The book comes with a code you can plug<BR>into Strengthsfinder.com and enter your responses to profile<BR>questions. Strengthsfinder then analyzes your information and<BR>provides a report of your five top strengths.<br />I completed the Strengthsfinder profile and found it to be quite<BR>accurate and helpful in pointing out my greatest strengths.<BR>Another part I found very useful was the chapter on how to manage<BR>other people based on their strengths profiles.

B0000TG9E2|5.0|This is the definative version of Alice in Wonderland, one of my favorite Disney cartoons.  It is presented in its original format of 4:3 (for the person wondering about widescreen, it was not used until 1953, two years after the release of the movie; Disney's 1st widescreen movie was Sleeping Beauty), with beautiful colors in the new transfer.  The movie stays very close to the two Lewis Carol books, and has many great extra features.  Highly recommended.
B00004TH7Z|1.0|Then you are clueless about Maiden.  This is so far off from their classics (I would say that that would include everything up to Seventh Son).  This is so dull and unambitious, that I was totally blown away - the wrong way.  Jannick Gers is HORRIBLE.  His presence totally ruins the Maiden formula, and his solos sound like $hitty Craig Goldie (Dio)/Reb Beach (Winger) noodling.  Nothing, I repeat NOTHING on this album is even close to Maiden standards.  If you gave this more than 2 stars, you are incredibly out of touch with what this band was all about.  This release sounds like a Queensryche or Dream Theatre album - or dare I say Grim Reaper or Helloween.  Putrid is the only way to describe this.  Even filler songs from past albums (such as quest for fire or deja vu) are a thousand times better than anything on this disc.  Use this disc as a coaster for your beer mug and pop in piece of mind.
0066620996|5.0|There are many leadership books containing leadership advice but have no solid grounding.  GOOD TO GREAT contains valuable leadership advice on how to build a high performing business organization, and it is based on empirical evidence. Whether you agree with the matricies that identify \\"great\\" companies, you have to agree that the companies studied and placed in this category far out-perform the \\"good\\" companies with straight forward explanations as to why. I highly recommend this book to organizational leaders....Author of LEADERSHIP IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURES.
B00008DDSC|4.0|This is a peculiar black comedy about a subject matter that has been approached in cinema before, but not in such an open and healthy manner. Sadism and masochism are subjects usually left for films about serial killers, sociopaths or the underworld of freaks. In cinema, at least, this topic, and the issues it raises about human sexuality, human suffering and the notion of power and dominance, has been for the most part, taboo, and it is a step in the right direction for the industry to present it in such a fresh, open and humorous way. <br />Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young woman with a few issues about herself and her family. The film opens with her leaving an institution, and her therapist wishing her well in the outside world. We come to see that Lee uses pain as a coping mechanism - burning and cutting herself when life becomes too difficult. She learns some office skills at the community college and lands a job at a one-man law firm. Edward Grey (James Spader) is not what one would say is your `normal' employer. When we first meet him in the interview scene, one gets the immediate impression that this man has a few issues of his own. As the story begins to unfold, however, one can see that these two unique individuals just might have something in common. This becomes all too apparent in the scene where he `punishes' her for making too many typos in her letters. Personally, I didn't know whether to be shocked or laugh during this scene, and ended up quite stunned and laughing at the same time. It would have been extremely difficult to pull off this particular scene without losing its underlying power, as it demands both comedy and depth, but Spader and Gyllenhaal made it real, funny and powerful in every sense. <br />~ Secretary~ is to a large extent a coming of age film. Here is a young, obviously intelligent and sensitive woman, discovering aspects about herself that are not necessarily `normal' to our middle-of-the-road sensibilities. She meets someone whomakes her aware about herself, and at the same time, she makes him aware that love can exist and be expressed without feeling guilt. This is a love story though a kind of love story one does not hear about very often. `Secretary~ is a funny, entertaining and first-rate film.
0385504209|5.0|Not being a lover of all mystery thrillers myself, Dan Brown's, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" nevertheless managed to hook me. The plot itself is centered around the Holy Grail and the secret society known as the Priory of Sion, and the whole concept of the story is made very believable by going so deeply into the history of the events surrounding the Grail, and portraying a reality completely different from most stories on the subject.<br />The books begins as the curator of the Louvre museum is murdered, but manages in his final hours to leave behind a string of clues for his granddaughter Sophie Neveu and Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon to find. The two are a secret society's last hope for saving a 2,000 year-old secret from destruction, but they need to make sure that whoever killed Sophie's grandfather doesn't find them in the mean time.<br />The Da Vinci Code really is a can't-put-down page-turner, you won't want to stop reading until you finish. Dan Brown has this irritatingly effective way of getting you to keep reading by writing very short chapters with a cliffhanger at the end of each one. A small issue with the story is how Langdon seems to always find room for a lesson in either symbology or history in places where you really couldn't care less. But aside from that, the book is a great thriller with an ending as surprising as the ingenious plot itself.
B0001906O0|5.0|Talking about a box-set: this is one. I remember a boxset I bought which looks the same (Message In A Box - The Police) and also had a very complete tracklisting. This box does the promise again! We got a complete set of flipsides over the Cure's long-time career, filled with some rarities and soundtracks which were hard to get/find. The sound is very clear and the remastering perfect. Beautiful booklet and adding information about the tracks &amp; discography. I'm (again) pleasantly surprised by another box-set; I lost hope with last years Retro by New Order. I'm very happy that I have a lot of tracks here which weren't available before on CD-singles. Great work!!! This is how a box-set should be ...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When i first got this cd i noticed it was different from Mer De Noms (french for sea of names).  The more I listened to it, i got the feel of the album, which i absolutely love. I do miss Troy and Paz, they were essential to the band, but they have moved on to other projects.  Overall, I think this cd was the best released of 2003. The lyrics are amazing, and the music is so relaxing and unique.  I hope we don't have to wait to long for the next album!
B000060P79|5.0|I've had this cd for over a year now, and I still haven't gotten tired of it. Simple Plan has been my favourite band now for a very long time. My favourite songs on the cd are probably &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; and &quot;Addicted&quot;. The rest are still great though too. And I've seen them live quite a few times, and they are very good, so if you like SP and they're coming to your town then don't miss it. you'll have tons of fun and most likly meet them. they are very nice guys.
0451528956|4.0|Who hasn't heard of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? Whether it be in Newspaper reports of daily conversation, references to these two characters ensure that nearly everyone in the English speaking world has at least heard of this story. The number of people, who have read the book, is much less however and until recently I wasn't among them.<br />Having read the book, I cannot recommend it strongly enough. Stevenson deals with the dual nature of `man' and his (or her) battle within himself. The plot is quite simple and it may have been this simplicity that gave the story its popularity. It could also have been Stevenson's skillful usage of the English language, which makes reading this book such a pleasure.<BR>The only bad thing about this book is its brevity. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B00006LLNU|4.0|I bought this CD in December of last year. Living in Michigan, December means snow, and sure enough, the first time I popped this CD in, I was in the middle of a freakin blizzard. I was trying to drive to the store to get Listerine and Jones Soda, ya know, essentials for a blizzard. Since I couldn't see more than 10 feet in front of my car, it took about an hour of driving when it normally only takes 15 minutes each way. But hey, I got to listen to my new CD.<BR>First of all, this is perfect snowstorm music. If I die in a car crash in the middle of a blizzard, I want this album playing. I think as I start spinning into the ditch, everything will get all slow motion and real dramatic and stuff... and this would be the perfect music.<BR>That aside, it's not a perfect album. For instance, I have no clue what this dude is saying cause I think it's in Icelandic, but even so, he only say maybe 5 or 6 different words throughtout the entire CD. He justs repeats them over and over. It's kinda annoying after the first 1/2 hour.<BR>And while the music is very beautiful, there's really no difference from one song to the next. It could be one 80 minute song and it would sound fine.<BR>But those are really my only two complaints. Sure, it's a little pretentious, but it's definantly a CD to buy.
B00005MP58|5.0|I, like a few other people I see here first heard of this adaptation from the Bridget Jones book.  After that build up I just had to see it and I'm thrilled that I did.  It immediately got me caught up in that world and you end up just caring about these characters and I literally could not stop until I'd seen the whole thing.  It's funny that it says that in the editorial review because it's true!  I stayed up until 1:00 AM to see the end because I just had to see these two people come together!  Please watch this fabulous movie and enjoy!  Jennifer Ehle is a delight.  She has such a special quality and the entire cast is picture perfect.

But, their work dosen't go unnoticed, Dr. Hill, a chief nero-surgeon and teacher who has butted heads with West since his arrival,realizes  Herbert's potential and wants to steal West's green serum for himself,so he can become famous. Of course, West isn't about to let that happen, so Dr.Hill ends up being decapitated.Curosity kills Herbert, since he's never brought dead parts to life,so he ends up sticking his green goo into Hill, the result is, Herbert gets knocked out,Hill gets away and steal's his re-animaton work. Now West has to get his work back, with the help of Dan(Hill also has it out for Dan, since he lusts after Dan's girlfriend, Meg and has now kidnapped her)and all this leads to a gory climax.<br />Review: Re-Animator is a rare breed, considering all the slasher movies that came out in the 80's,it was something completely different.It took the old mad scientist genre and the zombie genre and put a fresh spin on it. The result was reviviting, scary, horror comedy. It was the perfect balance between horror and some subtle comedy. This is what the abysmal CABIN FEVER tried to be last year, but failed completely.The movie is also scary and suspenseful, who wasn't scared when the cat in the basement jumped out of nowhere or seeing Dr. Hill's head in that tray? BRRRRRR. Thoseare just a couple of the horrifying moments throughout the movie. <br />The movie also works on a character level because screenwriters Dennis Paloi,Stuart Gordon and William J. Norris,gives you time to get know everyone on screen.The result is you care about every character.The most interesting one of the bunch is no doubt, Herbert West.Sure, he's cocky and egocentric,but we never learn he has any kind of evil motive for he what's doing, he just wants to put an end to death.Another cool character is Dr.Hill, he's relentless in pursuit of what he wants. Even after he's been beheaded, he still wants to have sex with Meg,which leads to the movie's most infamous scene and gives new meaning to giving head.We also find a perfect romance between Dan and Meg. Which is very well drawn out and is never cheesy.<br />The characters also wouldn't work as well on screen, if it wasn't for the actors protraying them. Jeffrey Combs is no doubt the highlight of the movie. His protrayl of the wide eyed, intense West is dead on. Bruce Abbott gives extremely solid performance as straight-laced Dan Cain. His chemstry with Combs is impeccable. Barbara Crampton does well as the pretty girlfriend. She and Abbott have wonderful romantic chemstry together.David Gale also steals the show as Dr.Hill,he had a Karloff like presence to him.Robert Sampson is also great as the dean of the medical school.This is one the best assembled casts ever in a horror movie.<br />First time director Stuart Gordon directs the movie very well,it's compently helmed and well paced,it's a very good job.<BR>While their's a few nices shots  here and there, the movie is not extremely stylish,but it's still very well done.Gordon also knows how to time suspense and knows how to scare you. Their's also no false scares in this movie which  is a huge sigh of relief,since horror movies heavly rely on that so much. There's also an uneasy atmosphere through out the whole movie,putting you on the edge of your seat.PhotograherMac Alhberg, who did most of the work for movie, is fantastic,he gives the basement scenes a dark look and gives the moruge scenes a creepy florescent look.A job well done in the  photography department as well.<br />The gore F/X is also great, considering that they were working with a limited budget. The F/X by Anthony Doublin, John Naulin and John Carl Beuchler are excellent. The gore is layed on thick and the climatic gory morgue scene is something legends are made of.<br />While it rips off the Psycho score, Richard Band's music for the movie is wonderful.The score is nicely done and enduring. You should definatly pick up the soundtrack for this movie,although it's somewhat hard to find.<br />In the end, Re-Animator is a horror classic and my #3 favorite movie of all time. It's too bad horror movie these days don't even come close to greatness of this movie. Instead were left with movies like CABIN FEVER, and JEEPERS CREEPERS 2, just to name a couple.Horror movies these days just don't have what it takes to be good.All in all,go and see this brilliant masterpiece,you won't be disappointed.<br />Elite Entertainment has released an excellent 2-disc Millennium Edition of this movie. It contains a widescreen(1:851) transfer,remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1,DTS 5.1, there's also the original mono soundtrack for all you purists out there.There's also Richard Band's isolated musical soundtrack presented in Dolby Digital 5.1,two commentries, one with Director Stuart Gordon, the other with producer Brian Yuzna,actors Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott,Robert Sampson and actress Barbara Crampton.

6305696071|5.0|when i first saw this movie i feel in love with the characters and how such a cute love story could even occur on hollywood boulevard. if you are a julia roberts fan ,as i am, this is one of the fundamental dvds needed for your collection, she shines in the role of vivian. i sure this is one of the greatest chick flicks of the century.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Those who are rating this CD 1 star have obviously NOT listened to it, nor have any interest.  I'm appauled that people who have never heard an album are able to review it on such an important site!  If these individuals had actually heard the music, they wouldn't be giving it such poor reviews!  If you listen to this album, you realize that the music and production are stellar as far as pop music goes.  Each song brings something different to the table and are enhanced by Spears' subdued but effective vocals.  If you're a fan of pop music, there is not one album out at the moment that can compete with this one!  Highly recommended!!
B00006879E|5.0|REFRESHING, DIFFERENT, FUN, HAPPY!! It's about time! I'm in that 30 something age group and the pop stuff is sickening. On the other hand if I hear one more Billy Joel or Elton John song I'll just scream! This group just gets it. They have a great sound that makes you want to get up and rock. I'm a huge Black Crowes fan and believe me I've been searching for something good for a long time. You can really sink your teeth into these guys! MMMMM YUMMY!
0385504209|1.0|Everyone loves a conspiracy, says Brown.  Well, obviously many do from the way this book is selling.  The problem with conspiracy theories is that they always have to torture the truth as this book does.  It does for history what \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" does for archaeology.<br />The Dossier Secrets were not \\"found\\" by the Bibliotheque Nationale, they were deposited with them where they were judged to be forgeries and there is no substantiated evidence that the Priory of Sion was anything other than a modern invention of very creative minds.  The account of the demise of the Templars in the book is a great example of history prostituted for the sake of a conspiracy theory.  The real story is much more fascinating.  In brief, the Knights Templar were extremely wealthy due to monopolies in banking and Near East shipping.  Their vast wealth caught the attention of the King of France, Philip the Fair (a reference to his appearance, not his character) whose dreams of empire were going unrealized due, in part, to the bankruptcy of his treasury.  He had confiscated the property of all the Jews in France and devalued the currency, but was still a little short of funds.  He had also kidnapped and disposed of the previous pope for standing in his way and exerted enormous influence over Pope Clement V, who understandably did not want to suffer the same fate.  Clement never made it to Rome, by the way.  He was installed at Lyon and got as far as Avignon - the beginning of a period in papal history known as the \\"Babylonian Captivity\\".  Philip first tried to get himself made head of the Templars.  They made the mistake of rejecting him - probably realizing his intention was to rob them.  So Philip rounded up all the Templars in France, trumped up charges against them, tortured confessions out of them, and seized their wealth.  I could go on with reference to other misrepresentations of history in this book, but it would take pages.<br />OK, it's a novel.  It does not need to be historically accurate.  True.  The book would just be good fun, except that the characters are completely unbelievable, the plot is transparent and the prose is about 5th grade level.  I suppose Mr. Brown is unaware, or unconcerned, that red-eyed mammals are visually impaired and often blind?  A rather cumbersome handicap for a hit-man, don't you think?  As soon as I read that, I knew I was reading a made for Hollywood script.  We have a Harvard symbologist who apparently does not know any foreign languages - a man who has studied Grail lore without any knowledge of French.  He is a well-traveled, mature bachelor who is scandalized by the Bois de Boulogne and seems devoid of any sexual or romantic feelings.  In fact, he seems devoid of any feelings at all.  He does not express outrage at the police trying to pin a crime on him or real fear at being a fugitive.  He is strangely removed from the events happening around him.  Perhaps he has been in academia too long.  Maybe he is just jet-lagged, which is kind of how I felt reading this.  Then we have a Parisienne who does not know the meaning of \\"clef de voute\\".  It is a common French term for the stone at the top of an arch, ie a keystone.  When you find out what she saw that made her stop speaking to her grandfather for a decade, you really have to wonder what kind of repressed thing she is.<br />The puzzles are ridiculously simple.  It is hard to believe that two supposedly intelligent people could not grasp the riddle of \\"Newton + orb + rosy flesh + seeds within\\".  I got it in seconds.  The ending of the book is apparent about half-way through and the big secret that would shake Christianity to its foundations just isn't such a big deal.  As Sophie says \\"I wouldn't mind\\".  After all, the same situation did not stop Siddhartha from becoming Buddha.<br />Really the whole thing is one big yawn.historically accurate.  True.

0394548442|5.0|Hiroshima is a book that reconstructs the experiences of several people, including a German missionary, following the dropping of the A-Bomb on that city.  It is a quite graphic and moving account, one that evokes the true horror that the survivors experienced.  The debate as to whether the dropping of A-Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was necessary will probably never be solved.  Personally, I don't think it was necessary, but that is irrelevant here.  The book is simply an attempt to put a human face on the incident, the failure or denial of which makes such heinous acts possible (I'm not defending the Japanese--they too committed unspeakable atrocities).  The book's message is one of great importance, and therefore very much worth reading.
B00005RHGK|4.0|'Jeepers Creepers' is a strange thing - for the most part, it's a genuinely impressive and extremely well-crafted horror movie, with shades of the true greats of the genre like the original  'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Friday the Thirteenth', but then it goes and lets itself down with a predictable, tensionless ending.<br />'Jeepers Creepers' follows the story of brother and sister pair Trish and Darry Jenner (Gina Phillips and Justin Long) as they make the long road trip home from college for the holidays. Along the way they have a nasty altercation with a large black truck, and that starts a chain of devastating events with a highway murderer, out for their blood and refusing to let go.<br />On so, so many levels this movie works better than most other contemporary horror movies. Hithero-unknown actors Phillips and Long prove themselves to be excellent actors, creating genuinely tense atmosphere and credible emotion in their roles. Direction, too, is excellent, with the hazy, summertime country highway vistas contrasing violently and to great effect with the chaos and noise of the Creeper and his truck. The images of the Murderer as a tall, all-in-black stranger work so very well - he's a genuinely scary character, an imposing figure straight out of a nightmare. The sense of isolation and tension created by director Victor Salva are strong, and give this movie the bulk of its strength.<br />Shame, then, that the ending is effectively ruined by a predictable, unscary cliche involving the supernatural and a fat psychic. 'Jeepers Creepers' goes from sublime to ridiculous with action-movie style scenes and when the bad guy is finally unmasked, we can;t help but feel so disappointed.<br />If you can overlook this fact, though, (and to be fair, the bad guy is visible in the rather good sequel from the get-go, not spoiling anything) 'Jeepers Creepers' is an excellent horror movie, and really one for any horror buff's collection.
6303014100|5.0|I am not, by nature a fan of war movies. However, I love this movie and have watched it numerous times despite its length. Each time I view it I get more from it. Unlike other reviewers I never looked at the beards or the cannons all that closely. I was more interested in the human drama that was the Civil War. While I agree some of the speeches are a bit heavy handed, they are out weighed by the fine acting and scope of the hard choices made on both sides of the line. If nothing else this movie has made me delve further into the life of my great grandfather who fought   for the union and survived. The movie is not about who was right and who was wrong, it is about human beings struggling with the battles that lie within all of us, and the choices we make. Since watching it I have become more interested in the events of that time and I have been doing a lot of reading about it. Even though I would be termed a \\"yankee\\" I am proud of the valor, bravery and sacrfice on both sides. From Chamberlin's gutsy troops to Picket's Charge it is all here in a movie that should be considered a classic.
0385720920|5.0|I became a Chuck Palahniuk fan as soon as I finished the book &quot;Choke&quot; I've read all his books except Diary which will be the next one I pick up...<br />I advise everyone to read all his books they are very intriguing and worth reading!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I have to say i like the new sound D.T. is going for, the much heavier metal is nice. but the problems are many. first i will start with the singing. ok, if dream theater reads this, please, please, ditch labrie. he is awful. 10 years ago he fit with the music, how that D.T. has ranked them selves with the heavy, they need a singer who can handle it. not one who whips out these high pitch squeals that would make satan weap. while i am making suggestions, i also say ditch the keys, they have a tendency to take away from the heaviness. you get a heavy heavy riff, then you hear the renaisance fair keys rip on top sprouting a really cheesy melody. or they should just start a new band, called nightmare cabaret, and ditch those two, get a new singer, and rock out some serious metal. and calm down with the lack of melody in the leads. alot of the solos on this disk sound more like exersizes then solos. just full blast 32nd notes, from begining to end. my advise is buy the album so you can complain about the singing and keys. outside of some self plagerizing, the riffs are awesome. song quality is good. special note, the 8:05 mark on track 3, is one of the heaviest riffs i have ever heard, not to mention the great into riff to #4, very death metal heavy. nice album, ditch labrie and whats his puce on keys, and you got an awesome band. until then, they will be a great backround with gnarly singing, and ballet style keys. man i am incredibly right, on every review i do.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This is about as close as you can get in a movie to the real Oz books by Frank L. Baum. This largely remains faithful to Baum's work. It has a good script, good acting and great effects (given the year it was produced). Don't expect an MGM sugar-coating. Return to Oz is great viewing.
B000002N2Z|5.0|First off, this isn't my favorite Deftones album. Truthfully, I don't have any favorite Deftones album. Each album, in my opinion, is a separate state of mind, and a different piece of art. Around The Fur is by far their best-flowing album, White Pony is their most ecletic cd, and their self-titled is their most beautiful disc, even if it is a bit short. What, then, makes Adrenaline so special compared to the other albums? It not only showed what was to come from these Sacto, CA rockers, but it kicked ass the whole time.<BR>When I mean it \\"kicked ass,\\" I don't mean the whole album sounds like Slipknot with an odd groove to it. No, not at all. Half of the songs are very quiet, at least at the beginning, and build up to a colossal wall of sound. Some good examples of mellow-psycho tracks are \\"Lifter,\\" \\"One Weak,\\" and \\"Birthmark.\\" Then, of course, you have your mosh songs. Prime cuts are \\"Bored,\\" \\"7 Words,\\" \\"Nosebleed,\\" and \\"Engine Number 9.\\" These songs will make you jump out of your seat, literally. When I first listened to \\"7 Words\\" while driving on the highway, I started bouncing up and down, and I sped up to about 85 or so. Needless to say, I figured out that self-control is necessary when one is driving and listening to Adrenaline.<BR>After the first nine tracks, you get into a whole different world. It is hinted at in \\"One Weak\\" slightly, even a little in \\"Root,\\" but not capitalized on until \\"Fireal,\\" ... Then...you have, in my opinion, the best Deftones song of all-time; \\"Fist,\\" track 11, the secret track. It refers to a lost love, yet this song, like many other Def songs, have no need of understand what Chino is exactly saying to know what he means. This song has amazing orchestration, even though it is a bit short, and is the perfect ending song, right up there with \\"Brena\\" by A Perfect Circle and \\"Hurt\\" by Nine Inch Nails.<BR>The bottom line: If you love metal, particularly Korn or Snot-type newer metal, you'll love this album. The thing is, though, that I do not consider myself much of a metal fan, yet I love this cd. Its songwriting, creativity and sheer emotion makes this album definitely worth buying. It will touch you, because it has touched everyone I know who listened to it. It is, for lack of a better word, perfect, like all other Deftones cds.<BR>Buy it.
B000050FEN|4.0|Seven is a film that is built on mood and performance. The movie for all intensive purposes shows just one murder happen on screen and that's by gunshot. What makes this movie so disturbing to people is it leaves a lot up to the imagination which is a much stronger tool. What the movie expertly does is set a mood by the way it's shot, by the constant raining and darkly lit, dunging sets, and an eerie soundtrack. It also sports one of the most distubing opening credit sequences which the filmmakers put a lot of thought and time into.<br />I liked that the movie focused not on delivering shocking moments but on themes of the human condition. Each of the main three characters presents a different viewpoint of life and purpose. What may disturb people most is that even the seriel killer makes a compelling arguement (in a sick way) and is guided by a deep rooted conviction. <br />If you like movies with happy endings do not see this film. This film was not made to have you leave with a smile. It does make you think however. I respect what the film accomplishes and the amount of care and detail that the filmmakers poured into this project and for that I give it four stars.<br />A note on the DVD --- It is one of the best out there in terms of presentation and special edition material. However, the alternnate ending is terrible. First off it is in storyboard form, secondly in is only slightly different but enough to be aweful so don't have your hopes up for something great in that regard.
B000053VAF|5.0|\\"Dogma\\" has got to be one of the most orignal movies that I have ever seen. It is a religious comedy that is always funny and always interesting. The only thing that you could do during \\"Dogma\\" is to listen to the dialouge. It works so well and the dialouge is often used by people just because it is so fresh and things like that have never been said before. The same has to do with most of writer/director Kevin Smith's work. He is the one who brought us the great movie \\"Clerks,\\" and other comedy greats like \\"Mallrats,\\" and \\"Chasing Amy.\\" I've only seen four of the five movies that Kevin Smith made, but this one is probally my favorite because of its story. I love the story and I love the humor. Crude, yet appropiate for the movie. People often wonder WHY this movie has such strong profanity and crude and sexual humor, but those people just don't seem ot understand. These are the kind of characters that use profanity and crude humor. Its just that kind of person, like you and me. Kevin Smith makes these characters perfect which is another reason why this movie works so well.<br />The star of the movie is Bethany Sloan, who works at an abortion clinic, and has to deal with the protestors with signs like \\"Child Murderer.\\" Events in her life has began to question her belief in God, but everything changes when she meets Metatron, the voice of God, who has a job for her. Cardinal Glick has designed a Church during its 100th year that has an archway that could lead to return of two banished angels Bartleby and Loki. Since God banished them, and his choice is infallible, it would prove that God is wrong, and the universe would just be nothing. The church is in New Jersey and Bethany is aided by two \\"prophets\\" by the names of stoners Jay and Silent Bob. Jay lets Bethany go along with him on the hopes of being able to sleep with her in the end, and Silent Bob, barely speaks. They also meet Rufus the 13th apostle who is never heard of and is now forgotten, and Serendipity, a muse with writers block who is right now pretending to be a stripper. God becomes missing, and Bethany and her group get to New Jersey while dealing with the demon Azruel and his street hockey gang of thugs. Azruel is hoping to help the two angels so that he could get his revenge of God. Bartleby and Loki get closer and closer to New Jersey, but Bethany cannot give up all everything in the universe would just...disappear.<br />When I first saw the movie I never saw anything of its kind. I feel that when it was released it could have recieved and Oscar for Best Orignal Screenplay. It was a critically acclaimed film that has many fans, and many people who don't want to see it at all. But those are the people who are missing out of this fun. It has an all-star cast. Linda Fiorentino, George Carlin, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock. Salma Hayek, and Jason Lee, all of which have huge comedic talent and are perfect in their roles.<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated R for strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content.
B00007KMP1|5.0|After being amazed by everything Beck has done up to this disc, I was hopeful that he could impart some more of his encrypted wisdom upon me.  You see, the love of my life had recently left me and I was living alone for the first time.  I don't need to tell you about the torrent of emotions this disc can extract.  I honestly felt like Beck had been following me for the previous year, documenting every heart wrenching moment that such a deep and profound loss can bring about.  But deep within the sorrow and pain of this work is a real sense of hope.  And genius.  Second to none lyrics encased in surreal and eerily beautiful soundscapes impeccably produced.  This is a true classic and should not be missed.  An emotional masterpiece.
0671027387|2.0|Gee, I guess I'm the only one in the world who thought the writing in this book absolutely sucked. Two-dimensional stock characters that I couldn't even force myself to care about, an okay but somewhat bored plot, pedestrian writing, and IRRITATING product placements - I got the feeling, as I do in Grisham books, that this book is an exercise in cynical marketing, NOT in creative, incisive writing. Yuck: No more Dan Brown for me. (While reading this book, I actually started wondering if \\"DANBROWN\\" was an acronym for software that had been programmed to churn out this kind of junk...)
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is a must have if you liked LoTR: The Two Towers, but want more. The movie is a heafty 3 hours and 43 minutes long, but every bit of extended time was well worth the watching.<br />The random horse that picks up Aragorn after his tumble down the cliff is explained. The endings seamlessly shift from LoTR: TT to LoTR: The Return of the King. From Merry and Pipin, the ring bearing group(Sam, Gollum, and Frodo), and Aragorn, each have scenes that meld this movie into the next. They should have been put into the movie, but most people couldn't sit through 223 minutes of Lord of the Rings(with this movie, I could have easily).<br />Most scenes further develop the characters, Eowyn's character is nicely rounded with more scenes with Aragorn. Faramir's desire of the ring goes much deeper than for the power of his people, that loose end it tied up in this edition.<br />What I liked most about the platinum series is the outtakes... and there are a lot of them. Everything about the movie, from how J.R.R. Tolkien painstakingly wrote the book, to the jaw-dropping performance of Andy Serkis(the man who MADE the personality of Gollum come to life(if he didn't get a Grammy/Golden Globe for his work, he should)), all is included. Galleries, galleries, galleries, and some of the pictures have commentary on how the picture/sculpture/scene was created.<br />Another neat feature are the several tracks of commentary throughout the movie. They take the place of the audio, and it's a neat addition if you wanted to further your understanding of the scenes.<br />All in all I recommend this edition of Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers to anyone's DVD collection. Well worth the extra money.
0783114222|4.0|Yes, yes - it is uneven, but that's part of why this miniseries is so good. Tom Hanks, Ron Howard and friends were smart enough not to merely recycle &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; but to experiment with different stories and different viewpoints and visuals. As the majority has commented, great pains have also been taken to cover more than the &quot;highlight reel&quot;, and be more historically accurate. <br />Some of the standouts:<br />&quot;Apollo One&quot; covers the tragic training exercise that killed Gus Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White. Interestingly, I have never seen Mark Rolston (Grissom) in a sympathetic part before, and here he plays one of the most revered astronauts of the entire space program! Both here and in a later episode, the engineers behind the spacecraft are profiled - one of the most intriguing and interesting parts of the whole series. Engineers and designers are so rarely given credit or shown to be &quot;cool&quot; or even dedicated, kudos to the producers for doing so. <br />The episode &quot;1968&quot; mixes disturbing and compelling real-life news footage to show the prevailing chaos that year. The skillful editing really gives you a sense of the paranoia that reigned that year, with MLK and RFK being assassinated within months of each other, as well as the Chicago DNC riots.<br />Bryan Cranston and Tony Goldwyn crackle in their roles as tense Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong. The next episode is a relief: Dave Foley is very, very funny, along with Tom Verica and Paul Crane as the 'also-rans' of the Apollo program. <br />Overall, it's just a pleasure to see the different approaches. Even when it falls flat a bit, the producers deserve so much credit for taking chances here. <br />I disliked the third episode, mocked up as a '60s documentary (it came off as way too polished, rather than the astro &quot;Medium Cool&quot; it apparently was meant to be)... And the episode with reporter &quot;Emmett Smith&quot; being sucker-punched by a young and hungry Jay Mohr wasn't as strong as it could have been, since we hadn't seen so much of &quot;Smith's&quot; personal side up until then, although he is one of the few constants through the many episode. If they had developed &quot;Smith&quot; as a character more, it would have been much more effective. Both cases were more critiques of the media than dramatic storytelling or historical reenactment. <br />Kudos also for paying attention to the heavy burden carried by astronaut wives - many of whom had already paid dues as test pilot wives. The original novel &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is absolutely poetic on the same topic. <br />Note: A below review claims that the Russians sent an &quot;unqualified woman&quot; into space. Ouch! Sounds like selective history. Actually, the Soviet Union has had a long history of female aviators, namely the famed &quot;Nacht Waxen&quot;, bomber and fighter pilots who fought during WWII. The Soviets even had two female aces, both of whom died in combat. <br />When the Mercury group was picked in the US, men with aviation experience were selected. Only a few, like Gus Grissom, were also scientists with advanced degrees. (Today, very few astronauts are primarily military-trained pilots, with most of them being literally, our brightest scientists.) <br />Likewise, Valentina Tereshkova was a parachutist, which is why she was one of the three women initially selected to train as a cosmonaut. After the training and poking and prodding she received, just like the Mercury astronauts, it's hardly fair to call her &quot;unqualified&quot;. <br />Laika the dog was unqualified, but not Tereshkova. Geez. <br />I suppose that because she was an industrial worker, her parachuting experience was slighted by the reviewer, even though communism often sent bright, but socially unconnected men and women into factories and menial labor. <br />Ironically, the US had many qualified women pilots - Jacqueline Cochran, a record-breaking test pilot springs to mind - but waited until 1983 to send a woman into space.
B00004XPPB|5.0|I have been wanting to see this movie for what seems like years now, due to the fact I love Mob movies and Johnny Depp's acting ability in any film he does. This is one of Johnny Depps first Big leading roles in a film and he holds up even against the great Al Pacino. Speaking of Al Pacino..he should easily have been nominated for a Oscar for his portrayal of Lefty, but more times than not the Oscar Academy has no clue what great acting is (Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York should have won last year no questions asked!). Michael Madsen is always a fun actor to watch on screen and this is one of his best performances. Anne Heche really impressed me with her acting as well and she actually looked kinda hot. The last scene in this film featuring Al Pacino opening a drawer, putting in a few precious items, closing it, only to open it again and leave it ajar a few moments later is truly powerful because of what it implies. This film may not be as great as Goodfellas, but it is one you can mention in the same sentence and not feel guilty about it. Tired of renting bad movies that look interesting because of the cool covers on the dvd, fuggetaboutit, rent or buy Donnie Brasco and go home happy.
B00006RINF|4.0|I found this disk to be a nice surprise.  I had heard swamped, and liked the song.  Then I bought a compilation CD that had Heavens a Lie on it, and I was hooked.  I bought the disk, and was not disappointed at all.  I absolutely love the female vocals.  Her voice is just incredible.  Unfortuneately, the guy is more so the Italian version of Ricky Martin.  Supporting he's ok, I just don't like when he has the lead vocals.  I have an honest belief that some record producer heard this band, and dug up the indivduals for Evanescence.  If you like that style, pick up the disk.  But beware of the Ricky Martin sounding guy.
B000005JA8|3.0|As popular culture understands it, and has understood it for a long time, The individual timbre of beats &amp; notes can only be arranged in so many linear ways. Timed in square evenly spaced juxtaposition to one another, so that it falls into the same area of relation that we have been conditioned to understand where sounds go to give our brain the impulse that we are listening to music. If you care only to know this circumstantially built up world of arbitrary sonic discriminations, avoid this album. Otherwise consider this;<br />This album is infact very ordered, some notes of instruments move faster than other ones, with odd time signatures, free metre vocals, but it all has very definite mapped-out structure, just a structure that refuses to be limited by it's surrounding elements. Everything going on here can only be appreciated when perceived in different, multiple, musical time than normal, conventional, form fitted music. The mind has to get used to a new environment (This has nothing to do with drug experimentation, simply a natural change out of established comfort zones made because of familiarity to deep seated relation with external stimuli, just as when learning a new language or an instrument, this is learning a new way to listen to music) This environment consists mostly, of several layers of musical time metres existing at one place in any given instance of a particular song.<br />Once you get to this point of reinventing your palette, a whole new area in your innate range of possible understanding is sated. That is why so many believe this album is so great, because it caters neigh exclusively to this area of conceptual space and co-habits it almost alone once this place in the human program of senses is found &amp; nurtured. Only when a majority of people can manage to successfully do this, will thinking and common consensus change, and therefore popular music will change and inherit more dimension and possibility, ceasing it's constant stale sterility and repetition of similar effort.<br />Like the ocean waves, the beats &amp; rhythms tread over one another, and roll through the respective flow of one another's current, but it's all due to controlled factors, it all recedes together out of the song just as the tide brought them in together as one track. All of the water regains it's integrity and continues to be the same resource, every stream has a set speed &amp; direction that every surrounding molecule also adheres to within the whole. This music is much less chaotic than that analogy is, but true in the same manner. It is form rearranged, but the same content as other music. This is not random sound as it may seem to some but is actually sound of a different time serialism than most. Why disregard a different objective way of arranging pieces of something in nature? It does injustice to reality's potentiality for every composition that there can be. Let your mind find order in every which way things can be aligned in relation to your senses. It is like when one moves their furniture in their house. They cannot keep with their routine of walking around their house the same, they must conform to the new layout of the house or the furniture becomes an obstacle that serves no purpose. Walk in ways that you wouldn't with your eye's closed, because being used to always walking in certain directions without a visual will lead you right against things, this could mean either that the furniture is wrong, or that your movement is wrong. Modifying yourself is ultimately more beneficial for you, whereas what's external will always be meaninglessly subjective regardless of how or why you choose to change it. This album is either something you will refuse to work your way through, or something you will use to create an ability for seeing patterns that are so much more expansive than the other ways which have formerly been thrust upon you.
6302902010|4.0|This version has the undoubted advantage of containing most of the original score and is more faithful to the concept of the opera held  ( we suppose) by the  Gershwins. However, we have been denied for some 40 years the chance to see the Goldwyn version, which contains the Sammy Davis performance of Sportin'  Life, arguably the role he was born to play. The review of the performance history of this important work will of necessity be incomplete as long as the Goldwyn production remains unavailable.  Previous reviewers have referred to the presence of great stars in the Goldwyn version as distracting.  I would counter that stars are stars because they bring something unique to the production, simply because of who they are.    In closing, I personnaly am not offended by cuts and changes to the score of a work that bridges the classical and jazz worlds.  Once you have invited jazz to the party, you have opened the door to personal interpretation that goes far beyond anything permissable in classical music, and this might be the best reason for such an invitation. One of the big obstacles to a real marriage of classical and jazz music is that classical music wants to make all the rules. I have no problem with a great arranger like Andre Previn with excellent credentials in both jazz and classical music reworking arrangments.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is a great movie, of course, but I want to comment on the DVD.  These Warner Bros. &quot;Two-Disc Special Editions&quot; are a great bargain.  They have all the special features of a Crtierion Collection DVD at almost half the cost.  And they also have much better subtitle options for my foreign friends.  This version of Citizen Kane, as well Casablanca and Singin' in the Rain are all great deals.  The only question I have is this:  if these &quot;Standard Versions&quot; really preserve &quot;the aspect ratio of their original theatrical/television exhibitions&quot;, then why are the intertitles cut off on the right side in this film???
B0000VAFNQ|1.0|When I first heard about this movie-and saw the previews, my plan was to let it pass me by, but since it starred Kate Beckinsale, I decided to give it a try when it came out on dvd.<BR>What a mistake-this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen-the plot and storyline are pathetic--and if there are any redeeming qualities at all it's the visual special effects--but they're not really able to save this clunker.  The move does have some gore--but no fear factor.  Avoid if at all possible!
0790729644|4.0|Technically, this is a first-rate movie with superb acting.  The violence was a little much for me, however.  It is true that all of Eastwood's westerns contain a lot of violence, but in this movie, the violence IS the story, and the story is consumed by it.  Also, in his earlier westerns, there was generally a clear distinction between the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot;, and you were almost glad to see the villains get smoked.  In this movie, there is no such distinction, and that makes the brutality rather senseless.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Here I go again. Gushing. But I can't help it. This nine disc set is the definitive DVD release for rabid Alien fans like yours truly.<br />I first saw Alien when I was eleven years old, from a projection booth at a drive-in. The sound was on a little speaker, the noise of the two 40's-era projectors a constant drone. The reels were being changed MANUALLY. But none of that mattered: I was sucked into the film so deeply it was like a hallucination.<br />I got that feeling again watching the first disc of this release. The picture and sound definition are so much better than the prior DVD release that it's truly astounding. It makes me wonder just how loose the THX quality \\"standard\\" is, since the original DVD was also THX certified. Obviously, the best available elements were used in mastering every film in this edition, and then digitally scrubbed to a high gloss.<br />Everyone reading this knows that only two of the four films are truly great. Numbers 3 and 4 in the \\"franchise\\" (I always hated that word applied to films) are problematic. But to a real fan that hardly matters. The Alien mythology, as it has developed over a quarter-century, is somehow larger, more captivating than even the films themselves.  The first Alien, to put it bluntly, was a B-movie wrapped in first-class art direction, cinematography, and performances. Even two questionable sequels can't dim its hold on the imagination.<br />If you're even thinking about buying this, you know the films pretty well. There is no need to go into detail about them. What may tip the scales and make you open your wallet is not only the crisp, detailed transfers, but a staggering (I use that word deliberately) amount of extra material that is intelligently produced and well thought-out. The hours of documentaries are not your usual promotional material; they are real, no-holds-barred inside looks at the making of the films - warts and all. For example, there is no attempt to gloss over the fact that Alien 3 isn't very good, or that the production was mired in meddlesome Groupthink almost from the beginning. Nor did the suits at Fox (to their credit) try to hide any of the legal problems and personal conflicts that plagued the first film (producers Gordon Carrol and Walter Hill thought Dan O'Bannon's script was a stinker - they actually banned him from the screening room during dailies and he had to sue them to get his name on the credits).<br />It's good stuff, all of it. The features on the special-effects are tremendous, with interviews galore - even with original Alien designer H.R. Gieger (who is well-known to be reclusive).<br />The only quibble I have is with Fox's desire to squeeze \\"special edition\\" versions out of all four films when only two of them really warranted the attention - the famous (and definitive) Director's Cut of the second film - Aliens - and the fascinating (if not exactly better) first cut of Alien 3, which has some problematic production dialog tracks that never got looped.<br />The first and fourth films were director's cuts as released. Nonetheless, for a die-hard fan, the first Alien's alternate version is definitely worth a look, as it contains the famous \\"cocoon\\" scene, as well as some other bits and pieces we've heard about, but never seen integrated with the film.<br />Alien: Resurrection's special edition is not even minimally special, as Jean-Pierre Jeunet is such an efficient director that there just wasn't any material to add, aside from a few trims and a brief scene on Earth. It's not really a bad film; there are some amazing ideas in it. Isolated sequences (like Ripley being carried into the queen's lair) are inspired. But it's marred by some ill-advised \\"humor\\" and a hammy performance by Dan Hedaya as a ruthless military commander.<br />Overall, the Alien Quadrilogy (questionable title notwithstanding) is a required purchase for card-carrying Alien devotees, even if they own prior releases. Buy it. Get lost in it. The hours you'll spend in the visionary world of these films (flaws and all), plus the avalanche of supplemental material, will repay the investment many, many times over.nd in the visionary world of these films (flaws and all), plus the avalanche of supplemental material, will repay the investment many, many times over.
B00006RINF|5.0|I've said it before so I'll say it again, watch out for these guys. They have what it takes to make it in America, having great radio friendly songs and a strong label in Century Media, so check them out!<br />Lacuna Coil has made a S/T debut EP and three full albums, chronologically, In a Reverie, Unleased Memories and Comalies and to be perfectly honest I can't say one is better than the other. They are the most consistent group I've ever come across. Yes their music is a little homogenous but I believe when the music is great, that is desirable. In any case, the music varies enough to keep things interesting and interesting is what you get!<br />Lacuna Coil is somewhat of an anomaly for an Italian band. Other Italian bands, such as Rhapsody, play epic power metal, Lacuna Coil devotes themselves to progressive, melodic, gothic style. Lovely singer Cristina Scabbia and singer Andrea Ferro share the mic and do a very good job at it. They compliment each other perfectly and give each song a special punch. Cristina's voice, while not quite on a par with other European divas such as Floor Jensen, is quite pleasant to listen to. It is deeper than some and a quality that fits Lacuna Coil's music(which is somewhat progressive)perfectly. Needless to say Lacuna Coil probably would not be where they are today without Christina.<br />I should point out that Lacuna Coil's brand of metal is not speed or even fast. Their tempo is generally in the medium/slow to medium range, which gives it time for slow minded individuals, like me, to absorb, sort of like Creed and like Creed, the music and delivery is powerful.<br />&quot;Heaven's A Lie&quot;<br />&quot;Oh no,<br />here it is again<br />I need to know<br />when I will fall in decay&quot;<br />&quot;Something wrong<br />with every plan of my life<br />I didn't really notice that you've been here&quot;<br />&quot;Dolefully desired<br />Destiny of a lie&quot;<br />&quot;Set me free<br />your heaven's lie<br />set me free with you love<br />set me free&quot;<br />So goes the fist verse and chorus of Lacuna Coils's brilliant, medium paced, hit single &quot;Heaven's a Lie&quot;, which begins with a lush symphonic introduction, before Christina's sultry vocals along with a strong beat and Andrea's backing on the chorus's.<br />If I may borrow and paraphrase the title to an old 60s song &quot;To Know Them is to Love Them&quot; I think that explains all. YES, BUT WOULD I LOVE THEM? Fair question and I'll answer that by saying that if you like or love any of the following bands, Evanescence, Garbage, Roxette, Pat Benetar, Joan Jett, Concrete Blonde, even Stevie Nicks, yes, you would love them.<br />If my &quot;Prediction&quot; comes through, here is my next prediction. Watch out for Within Temptation, they are already on their way. I did a review on Within Temptation's, Mother Earth back in June. They are similar to Lacuna Coil but more strident, more symphonic and generally more up tempo.e <BR>set me free&quot; <br />So goes the fist verse and chorus of Lacuna Coils's brilliant, medium paced, hit single &quot;Heaven's a Lie&quot;, which begins with a lush symphonic introduction, before Christina's sultry vocals along with a strong beat and Andrea's backing on the chorus's. <br />If I may borrow and paraphrase the title to an old 60s song &quot;To Know Them is to Love Them&quot; I think that explains all.

B00005JM0B|4.0|In the era of CGI as a substitute for story-telling - an era ironically given birth by this film's predecessor - Terminator 3 is a refreshing departure.  Certainly there are enough explosions, chases, gunfire, and jaw-dropping CGI effects to satisfy the visceral desire for excitement, but T3 also features memorable dialog, a well-constructed plot, and a philosophically satisfying answer to the question of determinism vs. free will posed by the first two films.<br />James Cameron's lack of involvement with this production is actually a plus: like Steven Spielberg, he can't resist the urge to pull heartstrings by sometimes force-fitting contrived \\"touching\\" situations.  Termitator 2 is a terrific movie, but I still wince when Schwartzenegger's T-101 says \\"I understand now why you cry.  But it's something I can never do.\\"  Some people found that moving.  I just thought it was corny.<br />Director Jonathan Mostow is, by contrast, more even-handed, if less technically astute (Cameron has a degree in physics).  Even the humorous bits (\\"Talk to the hand\\", the running sunglasses gags) come off as organic.  He is a skilled action director who doesn't ignore the human aspects of his story, and takes great pains to integrate them seamlessly with the genre tropes we have all come to expect.<br />The performances by Nick Stahl as John Connor (taking over for the troubled Edward Furlong), Claire Danes (radiant as his love interest), Kristanna Loken as the ultimate dominatrix-model terminator, and the ageless Arnold Schwartzenegger are top-notch.  Danes' performance is especially impressive when you consider that she was cast in the film and started shooting with literally no time to prepare.<br />Mostow's take on the story is less about the evil of big corporations like Cyberdyne, than about the destructive qualities of human nature amplified to apocalyptic proportions by our own machines.  For me, that is really the heart of the Terminator mythology, and he hits his target dead-on with an ending that is as poignant as it is surprising for a summer action flick.<br />The DVD is well produced. The extras are mixed, with a so-so making-of documentary, a fairly funny gag reel, and a sleep-inducing attempt at an interactive special-effects lab.  It could have done without most of them.<br />The reason to buy the film is not the extras; it's the film itself, which, for the completist, belongs without apology next to the first two films on your DVD shelf.ead-on with an ending that is as poignant as it is surprising for a summer action flick.<br />The DVD is well produced.

B0000004V2|3.0|Amid the buzz of the late 80s Manchester \\"Baggy\\" scene,The Stone Roses looked just right and had just enough decent tunes for a massive British press hype, but the music on this record was otherwise frankly average. 60s psychedelia merged with 80s indie shoegazing (a very unorigional combination even at the time of release)heralded as genius. Had they come from another part of the world other than Manchester they probably would have dissappeared into obscurity. It seems that the group themselves had no idea why the public had got so excited about this album and so took 6 years before managing to release another. When the 2nd album was released the press hype machine had long gone elsewhere and so it bombed and they split up. Its not a bad record but its nothing special. Dont believe the hype.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I must say... when i first heard the soundtrack I couldn't really get into the music. But I recently saw the show...and the cd is playing constantly. Seeing the show has filled in the story-line holes that exist on the soundtrack... however, even without seeing the show... there are some great numbers on the recording..especially &quot;for good&quot; and the incredible &quot;defying gravity&quot;. Listen to the lyrics.. pay close attention... they are strong with meaning...and will speak to you.
B00005JM02|4.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is a touching, fun-for-all-ages film made by Pixar. It's not just a cartoon, its a story about bonds friendship, ties of family and absolute deep-sea fun! <br />The sweet story is about Marlin, a father clownfish looking for his lost son, Nemo, in the seemingly endless ocean. Another rather annoying yet hilarious fishie is Dory (a regal tang fish), a forgetful yet wonderful companion of Marlin when he was searching for his son. <br />Nemo and Merlin, through the difficult quests to find each other, experienced different hardships and met many other sea creatures. As the story goes, the audience can see the development of each characters and how their journies influenced them as a fish.<br />Another great facet of this film is that the Pixel movie crew did a faaantastic job with the animations. The creatures look so adorable with their toothy smiles and scaley bodies!
B000056N8X|4.0|This supposedly final chapter (although another is in the works) almost equals the first one in style and score. However, it loses a little bit for comprehensibility. This is a film strictly for &quot;Highlander&quot; fans. Any outsiders will be very confused. OK, here goes: Duncan (Adrian Paul) and Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) are reunited when renegade immortal Kell (Bruce Payne) becomes the most powerful of all immortals. It will take both of them to stop him, but as the immortals like to say, &quot;there can be only one.&quot; At first, it makes little sense, but repeat viewings do help. Director Douglas Aarniokoski does a splendid job with the fight scenes and the flashbacks and also does what he can to weave a coherent story. The music in this film is just incredible and the soundtrack is a must-have. The film succeeds a little more on an artistic level in the sense that the film looks fantastic, but doesn't provide enough meat in the story. Is it great for &quot;Highlander&quot; fans? You bet. Will others enjoy it? Probably not. Also: watch for an appearence by WWE wrestler Edge.

B00005RYL9|4.0|This film may not accomplish much in the long run, but the phenomenon is spawned is outstanding. We meet Russel Nash (Christopher Lambert) at a wrestling match where he leaves to the parking garage and gets into a swordfight with a strange man in a business suit. Soon after, we're thrust 500 years ago into the highlands of Scotland, where we learn that Nash is really Connor MacLeod, an immortal being who is banished from his native land and accused of using satanic magic. He then encounters Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches him the ways and rules of immortals. From there, the story unfolds into an epic so different from anything else Hollywood has to offer. The overall story itself is a moderate romantic adventure, but the swordfights and camera work as well as original music by legendary band Queen make this film a rollicking good time. A must-see for all action and fantasy fans.
B0000UJL96|4.0|I was all set to return this disc when I opened it due to the lack of a booklet/chapter listing. It turns out Paramount did not include one in this package, apparently to cut costs.<br />Paramount is also releasing all six of these Trek movie special editions in a box set. It's too bad they don't offer a way for collectors to purchase the actual empty box itself to house their set in.

B00008PW3Q|3.0|It's interesting that people seem to love or hate this CD.  For every great 3 or 4 reviews, another person gives it a big thumbs down.  So it would seem for the die hard Fleetwood mac fan, this release has gone over very well.  Yet in terms of sales, it was a total flop (their worst selling release with Nicks and Buckingham involved).  It is ranked 1,421 in sales on Amazon after only being in release 9 months. Thats incredible when you think about it considering their history going back 30 years, and the CD barely sold the copies that were preshipped (about 500,000) which some say will end up in cut out bins.  So what happened?  As it would seem there are a couple hundred thousand Mac fans that liked Buckinghams slick production on this release.  This would have made an awesome CD had it been a Buckingham Nicks Volume 2 (if it would have been released a little sooner) maybe 10 years ago.  But it just doesnt sound like classic Fleewood Mac.  I admit there are some standout tunes on this CD, a few by Buckingham and a few by Nicks.  I made my own little computer version of the Best of Fleewood Mac and six songs made it onto my compilation from Say You Will.  But SOOOOOO much of this CD sounds like solo work from Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  True they are better together, and the rest of the band highlight them but if your looking for something that follows Tango In The Night, it just dont happen here.  This should have not been a Fleetwood Mac album.  Fleewood Mac is was great because they were a trio with John McVie doing great work on guitar and Mick on drums.  When you take away from something like a band like this, your risking potential failure.  Could that be when every Fleetwood Mac album without Nicks/Buckingham/McVie all together has failed to be popular?  It has happened in every case and every release with them all has been a smash.  They probably figured Buckingham Nicks was enough to pass, but remember Christine McVie was the British influence inthe vocal department and without her you simply have Buckinghamn Nicks.  Part of the formula and sound is missing and thats why this CD flopped.  It is also way too long, and should have been limited to 60 minutes.  Again there are some great tunes here, Peacemaker and Say You Will are awesome, and many of the other songs everyone have commented about.  Notice everyone seems to pick the same songs as their favorites?  But 6 or 7 good songs that more like solo work or Buckingham Nicks II is not enough to be Fleetwood Mac.  You dont have to agree with me but look at the success of this CD.  500,000 compared to the usual 3-4 million (and much more on the earlier releases).  Can 3.5 million people be wrong who didnt buy this CD?  Of course credit the die hard fans who will stick to their band no matter what.  I myself am hoping for better things on the next album, if there is another album.  Given the pride of these great artists, I think after this they may stop making new music as Fleetood Mac. They are not the kind of group that will keep pushing out releases only for die hard fans.  They made a big connection with the world for over 30 years and sold millions and millions of records and CDs.  There comes a time for every band to stop making new music.  A new tour though would always be a delight with the ENTIRE band back together and perhaps a new double live CD from classic concerts from various tours?

And i thought the overall hard songs this time billy kinda shied away from the mike it seemed like he wasnt as into it. I know he has a timid voice but i still think he should gone into it more. I canfind a hint of James Iha getting tired of doing what he does best
B00006SFBD|5.0|death metal doesnt describe these guys, think of decapitated or cannibal corpse mixed with rush. wow. ya, thats hardcore sounding and so is this band. the best prog and metal mix ever, in my opinion. not as good as blackwater park but it kicks your butt just as well. masters apprentices raises the hairs on your arms..
B000000W6F|5.0|well like many of you i heard of smashing pumpkin's '1979' and i loved them. the video was great but i didnt know much about the pumpkins really. so in my quest to broaden my musical horizon instead of getting of getting MCIS first i bought Gish. This CD is unbelieveable. i could not believe how great this band is. first off im a drummer and jimmy chamberlain needs no introduction. second, James Iha! i love his huge chords and those solos that are vintage. Billy has a very unique voice. hmm... if you listen to this record you will find that no matter what they do there is always a hint of sadness.

For kids, there is a virtual Wonderland tea party where every time you play, there's going to be something different, Sing Along songs, and an Adventures In Wonderland Set-Top Game. For the more mature audience, the second disc provides a great look into the past. There is the original One Hour In Wonderland tv special hoasted by Walt Disney, clips from the Fred Warring show, in which a band plays music from the film and live actors act out scenes. There is also several demo's of songs that didn't make it into the film, including one about the Jaberwoki for all you fans of the books. There are some brand new featurettes that are very entertaining, including From Wonderland To Neverland, about how the song, \\"Second Star To The Right,\\" from Peter Pan, was originally written for Alice. A few things about the special features disapointed me. The only disapointment about the special features was the newly discovered Chesire Cat song, \\"I'M Odd.\\" Disney only found the original sheet music so they had to re-record it and the music was set to clips from the movie instead of storyboards.  But there are so many great things about this DVD that that dosen't even matter. I highley recomend you buy this DVD for you and your family.
B00006M183|4.0|Im a huge pj fan but it took me awhile to get riot act because i didnt think it would be that great boy was i wrong. this cd is just amazing i love listening to it. PJ has become a very uniqe band this cd is a completion of binaural. meaning some parts of it is a better binaural. matt writes more in this as well and of course there is BOOM. but the reason you should get this album is you will not find any other band like PJ. this is a one of a kind band right now. &quot;you are' for example . this type of song will not be played anywhere. some of my favorites include &quot;1/2 full&quot; and &quot;cropduster&quot;. plus Ghost is an awesome track
B00000DRXM|5.0|Blizzard Of Ozz was Ozzy's shineing moment with then guitarist Rhandy Rhoads. This was a land mark album for Metal and Metal guitar. All killer and no filler is a expression that should not be used lightly about this album.<br />All the songs are Ozzy Classics weither it be 'Goodbye To Romance' 'Crazy Train' or 'Revalation (Mother Earth)' its sure to please. This was Ozzys first album after being fired from his first major band Black Sabbath. This was an instant classic and went multiplatnom.<br />This was also a landmark album in the guitar world, a little guitar player by the name of Rhandy Rhoads plug in and invented speed metal! And those people that say Rhandy ripped off Eddie Van Halen can just go to hell because the two sound nothing alike! Rhandy is a Neo-Classical prodigy, and a force to be recond with. The solo's on 'Crazy Train' and 'Mr. Crowly' are conciderd my many to be the greatest solos of all time! 'Revelation (Mother Earth)' In my openion is Rhandys best moment on the album. This is a classic Metal album the all metal heads and Black Sabbath fans should own!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|People that think that &quot;music&quot; must just be played on &quot;real&quot; instruments and by &quot;real&quot; bands are living in the past.  Get over it.  People thinking that Britney is claiming to be responsible for all the music on this album are also wrong.  These days the best music is created by huge teams of writers, engineers, producers, and of course the artist.  I've not heard this entire album but think about it, the team behind Britney have a huge budget and have selected the best writers and producers on the planet.  Toxic, for example is a superb tune, for me a genre changing work of genius.  (Just wait until you hear many clones of this over the next few months.)  Britney here is merely the performer, and she is performing it very well.  But don't write off the music just because it's Britney.  Have an open mind and you will find there is some amazing music out there.  The &quot;is this music?&quot; dude needs to grow up and join the rest of us in the 21st century.
B000002J1U|5.0|In Through The Out Door and Presence are both incredably underrated albums but Led Zeppelin III is a master piece. We all knew that Jimmy Page was one of the top electric and slide guitar players of all time, but I mean when he picked up and acoustic it was no differnt, I mean the man can do no wrong as far a guitar playing goes. Its no shock that he inflenced everyone from Joe Perry (my hero), to Steve Vai, to Alex Lifeson.<br />Led Zeppelin III is unlike any other Led Zeppelin album because it blends folk rock with hard rock with slight jazz and some powerful blues. The album opens with the albums only hit single 'Immigrant Song' which may be a little short in length but boy does it pack a punch! it is the hardest rocking track on the album. 'Friends' and 'Thats The Way' are both beautiful acoustic songs with a nice easy feel. 'Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp' is just plain fun and its complatly differnt from the song on PG that has almost the same name. 'Out on The Tiles' is a great song Bonham wrote when he was drunk out on the town one night, classic! 'Tangerine' is just pure classic Led Zeppelin, no other song in their collection is like it. Its just plain beautiful! 'Gallows Pole' and 'Hats Off To (Roy) Harper' are both classic Led Zeppelin tracks. 'Since I've Been Loving You' the blues in Cm, its the best moment in Robert Plants carear. Jimmy Page is just smokin' on this one, pure original blues licks and the solo is the single greatest Jimmy Page solo ever recorded, and yes even better then 'Stairway To Heaven' on Led Zeppelin IV.<br />This is a classic album that should not be passed up. YOu are not a true Led Zeppelin fan untill you own this underated masterpiece!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are not original. The Strokes are not highly varied. The Strokes are not cutting edge. The Strokes will not be remembered in 100 years. Vocalist Julian Casablancas is quite the jerk. <br />Regardless, this album is a lot of fun, and perfect for sticking on at chilled out parties and for driving along in your little Honda Civic. I think the energy that these boys put into their music makes it all the more enjoyable. <br />I recently saw The Strokes play live, and whilst the show was a little boring visually, it was performed with perfection, and you could really see Nick Valensi and Fabrizio Moretti getting into it. These boys have reawakened the Lou Reed love in all of us, and I think tracks like 'Someday' and 'The Modern Age', while not being greatly inventive, definitely mix it up from the current crop of nu-metal we're all subjected to. <br />10 out of 10 to these guys. I love it.
B0000027RL|5.0|Look I know that all the albums Pearl Jam put out were all hughe and all increadably good but none of them are better then Ten. This is the one that made Pearl Jam famous and started the grunge movement. This is the one that influenced countles bands since its realese. This was my first Pearl Jam album, and I can easily say its their best. Vs. and Yeld were both superb but none of them can touch the power of Ten.<br />Mike McCready's guitar is at its best here on songs like 'Alive' and 'Evenflow.' Eddie Vedders voice is amazing as usual and he doesnt seem to be full of his self on Ten like he got on latter day albums.<br />The stand out stracks on Ten are 'Evenflow' 'Alive' 'Jeremy' and 'Black' which I honstly think is the best song Pearl Jam ever recorded, its dark and deep and just flat out amazing, its everything you could ever even hope to have in a good song, and yes its that good, but Pearl Jam refuesd to release it as a single for what ever reason.<br />Ten is one of those albums that comes along only every so often, Im not going to compare this to the other amazing grunge albums of the day like Nevermind, Superunknown, or my personal favorite Dirt because none of these bands are alike and all the bands are differnt, each being original, and Pearl Jam was probly the greatest band of the 1990's and they wouldnt have been as big with out Ten.
0767903862|2.0|Bryson is as funny and as lively as ever. Laugh-out-loud funny. But this is one of the few books I've ever quit before finishing. Bryson makes too many factual mistakes and mis-shadings of his subjects. He clearly tried to assimilate too much material too fast as a writer when he was travelling; the result is bad history and bad journalism, though good comedy. Nothing I spotted was consequential by itself, but by the third little error in 30 pages -- and who knows what else I didn't spot - I figured I might end up mistaken about Australia when I get there myself if I kept reading. Read this book if you want to smile, not if you want to learn and get things right. Think of reading this book like watching a sitcom about Australia; you'll laugh and pick up a few things, but never forget it's just entertainment.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Since when did everyone who gets a computer get a MBA from NYU in Film and Theatre Arts?  I was just wondering becuase everyone wants to slam this movie and I bet a hundred bucks that atleast 75% saw Star Wars 2 and said oh yeah that sucked and bought that when it came out on DVD.  Now that se(pre)quel series sucks.  Despite the heavy influence of the New Testament in the Matrix movies, these are cinematically excellent.  Great special effects, I mean these directors sought out to make a walking talking anime movie. And they did it hands down inviting the world to both the good and the cheesy.  I don't think that they were looking for nods from the Academy critics.  If you want to have some fun and maybe be left with something to talk about with your buddies over some beers get this.  Even if you didn't see the first two,(if you didn't where have you been)no I am kidding, get it anyway, make yourself figure out all the supposedly obscure and awesome metaphor within the story.  It is about computer software.  A virus and a virus program.  Just sit back and enjoy a action movie.  It was better than Gladiator Two, I mean the Last Samauri, I mean every movie that has come out, I mean Troy, I mean every movie that will come out.  Enjoy it.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I had a strange experience when I saw Lost in Translation.  I was the only one laughing in the whole theatre.  I was dying of laughter while the rest of the theatre was silent.  But there is a reason for this.  Having been to Japan 4 times I totally knew how the main characters felt.<br />This was a brilliant movie, but the watcher needs to be warned that if you have not been to Japan you might not fully see why the film has gotten all the rave reviews that it has.<br />My favorite scene which has happened to me so many times is when Bill Murray in the in elevator and looks around and notices how different he looks from all the Japanese, how out of place he feels.  Anyone who has travelled to Asia has felt this moment.<br />I really loved this movie....Sofia Coppola has almost made up for single handly ruining Godfather 3!
B00009V8Z9|1.0|I've got to agree completely with&quot;a music fan&quot;from chicago,and harrisburg.I was impressed with his energy on the tv show,then I checked him out on amazon's preview and wow was I let down.<BR>Thanks amazon,you just save me some cash I can spend on something fresh.
0451191153|4.0|I had read Atlas Shrugged a year and a half ago, and I loved it.  As a single working woman myself, I adored and identified with Tagny Taggart, the heroine of that book, throughout all the ups and downs of the story.  The two criticisms that I had of that book was the excessive use by the author of the phrase \\"as if\\" and the lengthy philosophical \\"lecturing\\" every now and then which tended to be boring and made me say to myself, \\"Oh, not again.\\"<BR>   <BR>I just finished recently The Fountainhead, and I have to say that Atlas Shrugged was much more powerful.  I wished after finishing The Fountainhead that I had read it first before Atlas.  When you consider that The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and Atlas was published in 1957 you can see the reason...  fourteen years of life experience.<BR>   <BR>Here again, the author uses \\"as if\\" just way too much, but the philosophical \\"lecturing\\" seems a little less than that of Atlas Shrugged.  On the other hand, The Fountainhead, to me, was much less convincing as a story.  Why would a woman who claims to love a man go and do all what she did (I don't want to spoil the story for perspective readers) instead of standing by him  through thick and thin?  It just didn't make sense to me.  The only reason seemed to me just to make a novel out of it.<BR>   <BR>Also, I was surprised to read at the end of the Fountainhead (under the title About Ayn Rand) that the goal of Rand's novels is the projection of a moral ideal man: \\"My purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard Roark or John Galt or Hank Reardan or Francisco d'Anconia as an end in himself-not as a means to any further end.\\"  O.K. what about Tagny Taggart, the heroine of Atlas Shrugged?  Wasn't she a moral ideal woman too?  This looks like sexism to me.  I understand that Atlas was written in 1957, but still if the author was able and willing to write such a courageous character as Tagny Taggart at that time, I think a statement like this is sexist.I loved all three heroes of Atlas, especially Hank Rearden, but I loved Tagny Taggart just as much, if not more.
B000127LW2|1.0|Trek has a proud history of creativity, engaging stories, rich charachters and an ability to make social comments without being a blunt instrument.  All that ended with this series.  Set with an over the top PC crew Voyager drags us along offending any true star trek fans sensibilities.  All the major charachters could have been replaced by the life sized card-board cutout counterparts and delivered approximatly the same performance.  The total lose of imagination is clearly evident in the seemingly never ending stories of the ships holodeck, or some rogue hologram.  As if the adventure of unexplored space could'nt provide infinatly more excitement than dragging out the tired old cliche \\"haywire holodeck\\" routine.  It didnt work for Star Trek TNG and it CERTAINLY does'nt work here either.  The villians are no more thoughtful than the primary charachters.  Carbon copies of the mustache twirling archtype or some other ripped off race idea such as the Hirogen being nearly stolen bodely from the \\"Predator\\" films.  When this series was still running originally it was doing very poorly, so what did they do.  They took out the only charachter that even remotely had an unusaul clever background and replaced her with some top heavy woman in a slinky outfit to try to lure viewers to the show instead of acutally working on plot or the intellegince of the show. That is not what Star Trek is about. Janeway, the first female captain is self-serving and sanctomonious in her attitude,yet holds others to the very highest code of morality.  However when she breaks such rules of conduct, all is forgiven. This is not to mention the fact that she was made so overpowered that one wonders why she even needed a crew.  Two-faced and pompous she is not likeable nor is she a good leader, Her ship would have been aptly named \\"THE BOUNTY\\".  Using the Maque, a rogue organization broken away from starfleet, removed any adventure from exploration and turned it into a self absorbed hunt to get homeat ANY cost. I dont want to get into specifics of the series,( a requirement to writing a review is not to reveal plot points), but lets say the borg should have no problem conquering Earth and the Alpha Quadrent after its run in with Janeway, especially the last episode.  Though this does'nt happen until later seasons, just giving a heads up.  In summation,...don't waste your hard earned money on this dvd series set.  It is an insult to Trek and Trek fans.  If you have never seen it and are thinking about it,do this instead,..get 1 video and watch it.  More than likely it will be the same plot line as 9/10 of each other episode.  Just with the charachter roles switched around a bit.  If you don't like Trek and love monotinous stories, tired plots, cliche charachters and non-sequitor logic this series is for you.  Otherwise the disks themselves make good coffee cup coasters.
B000021XS0|5.0|My only complaint is that as a metalhead, although I do enjoy Pink Floyd, the ballads at times are unbearable! Especially with the gosbal vocals on ''The Spirit Carries On'', Dream Theater comes off more like Mariah Carey (shiver!!!) Besides that this album is perfect! ''Overture 1928'' and ''Finally Free'' go beyond anything Dream Theater have done before and along with ''Strange DeJa Vu, Fatal Tragedy, Home, Dance Of Eternity'', Metropolis P.2 has more high points than any other of their releases.<br />.....One more thing, DON'T say a word about this album until you've listened to it the WHOLE way throughat least 4 times. The only thing it will do is grow on you. Trust me on this.
0385504209|1.0|The writing is mediocre, the characters poorly drawn.  Mr. Brown writes with an irritating pedantic style that is exacerbated by incorrect information and poor fact checking.  Example:  We are told that the source of the term &quot;left wing&quot; is identical to the source of gauche and sinister when it in fact it relates to the seating arrangements in the French National Assembly.<br />The characters behave in ways that defy rationality or comprehension.  Do yourself a favor and skip this dog.
B000060P79|1.0|I feel sorry for all of you men who have fallen into this death trap known as &quot;Pop-Punk&quot;. For young &quot;teeny-Boppers&quot; that is quite understandable, as I watched my sister go through the stage as a youngin'. The fact is, this CD SHOULD NOT be qualified with the word &quot;punk&quot; in it at all. Simple Plan, New Found Glory, AFI, etc., they all sound identical, so if you here one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. This is not rock, so get over it and stop pretending that it is. Just because they PRETEND to be good guitarists doesn't mean that they are (they have no talent). Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to see the backstreet boys with guitars? Well, here it is. Unwillingly, I give this CD one star, even though it doesn't deserve any.
1401300901|3.0|&quot;PS, I Love You&quot; is an entertaining and enjoyable read. <br />Holly, the thirty year old heroine, lives in Dublin and loves her life. Then fate delivers a brutal blow: her beloved husband dies and leaves her a very young widow.<br />The book recounts Holly's first year after her husband's death. His final gift to her is a series of notes to be opened at the beginning of each month. Each note contains one suggestion to help Holly move on with her life. And each note is signed &quot;PS, I love you.&quot; <br />The book is quite moving as it depicts Holly's struggle to follow her husband's suggestions-give away his clothes, take a trip with her friends-and continue living. She realizes that her life had centered almost completely on her husband--not necessarily a good thing-and now, for the first time, she has to create a life for herself. <br />My only complaint with the book is that I found the writing amateurish at times. The plot, the characters and the ending were all satisfying and fully developed. However, I winced at some of the writing.<br />Still I would recommend this book to chick lit lovers everywhere.
B000084T18|3.0|50 Cent has talent, but this album showed no display. Sha Money's beats were not doing it, Eminem's beat didnt shine. The lyrics were not exactly gangsta or floss. I expect a 2Pac hit em up style or California love party till the morning style. But only a couple of songs assembled that, In da Club, Back Down, Blood Hound. Some of the other songs are plain garbage and you cannot sit through it. Delivery was okay, gets a B- but the lyrics about getting shot 9 times and how bad Ja Rule is is pretty old. PIMP is very commercial. If I Can't was a listenable son but 21 questions is trying to show his mellow side, and he wasn't very good at it. &quot;I love u like a fat kid loves cake.&quot; good metaphor there. Hes a rookie and he has alott of protential under Eminem and Dr. Dre, hes crew display little talent, but as long as he shines, he will be okay.
6305897786|1.0|-it's a God-Awful &quot;movie&quot; (despite Depp and Polanski) that should've been much better. Terrible script, plodding plot, when it ended, thank Allah!<BR>Too f**king bad they don't offer negative stars for a rating, this would be a shoo-in for minus infinity.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I have seen this movie and absolutely love it. It is an awesome performance by Johnny Depp and Martin Landau. I have been waiting with baited breath for its release and now it is delayed again. This is unfair to toy with customers. There are thousands who want this movie. Please let us know why it was delayed yet again. All I can say further is \\"Ed Wood Where Are You?\\"
B00005JKN9|4.0|This movie is about New York city durning the civil war years. The citys 5 points were run by a gang known as \\"The Natives\\" lead by historical figure, William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Cutting. The son of Bill the Butchers last real opposition, Amsterdam Vallon (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the 5 points with revenge on his mind. One of the greatest performances ever was turned in by Daniel Day Lewis as \\"Bill the Butcher\\"; truely unforgetable. Even though many seem to want to bash DiCaprio, he does a excellant job in this film as well. If you are looking for a film that will leave you feeling all warm & cozy inside...Look someplace else. This is a grim tale of power, coruption and vengence.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love this CD.  It was so worth the wait for her to put out another one!  You will love it too!
B00005JM1F|4.0|I have seen this movie around 8 times already and it just keeps getting better. This is a movie about 3 friends and how wacky their lives become when one of them, Will Ferrell, gets married and Luke Wilson catches his girlfriend having a 3-some; along with several other activities she admits too. Vince Vaughn steals several sceens with his sarcastic wit. The 3 friends decide to start a fraternity and make it what every fraternity wishes it was. Look for Will Ferrell to turn in a very funny performance; especially when &quot;Frank The Tank&quot; reappears. This movie keeps getting funnier every time I see it. I find little things I somehow missed before.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Every aspect of the show is solid.  I havn't yet been disappointed by Joss Whedon. Highly rewatchable.  I will never understand the brain trust at Fox.  They don't show the episodes in order and air them on Fridays.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This album 'is' deserving of 5 stars simply because it's a Beatles album.  The material is very good because the Beatles very seldom wrote bad material, but within the context of the Beatles itself the material is only fair. On top of that, I find this new album to be gray and dull, whereas before it I would have characterized all beatles songs as all kinds of various different colours which could have their diversity defined by a chain in which one colour connects to it's opposite colour. This album has little diversity where all the songs can't connect to their opposite colours because the colour of the links are all the same.     Paul McCartney might come along and say: \\"Hay, this is going to be one of greatest album ever, if we make it sound like it's supposed to sound.\\" Well, it's not! The simple fact is that the Let It Be album is the Beatles weakest album since 1965. It's impossible to have made a great album out of this. If anything he's made boring without the production of the Spectorized version.     The five stars rating is for the songs themselves. Most of them are very good, but the album just doesn't sound like the Beatles to me. Get the original... Or if you're new to The Beatles get the Revolver album.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|only one word can wrap up Underworld, BREATHTAKING! Theres action, a catchy story, awesome actors,  cool effects, and just the perfect movie. About a war between two immortal species, i was hooked. I'm a fan of a lot vampire movies like &quot;queen of the damned&quot; &quot;blade 1&amp;2&quot; &quot;dusk till dawn&quot; and a whole lot more. The effects in here make you feel like you are in the movie. Also the only thing they could change is the soundtrack. they should add some gothic, hard metal artists such as korn, maybe even moody. this movie kicks ass, and if theres a sequel, then WOW!
B0000CEB62|2.0|This was a landmark concert for Depeche Mode.  If I had been at this show myself, I might have fallen to my knees out of sheer delight!  However, the original show had at least 20 songs and was originally put onto 2 CDs (see the 2-CD box &quot;101&quot;).  The concert on the DVD (disc #2) has 11, and barely lasts an hour.  Where's the rest of the show?  <br />The original mood of the opening (Pimpf) of the show is broken by inserting &quot;Master and Servant&quot; out of sequence.  And what's this?  Have some of the songs been shortened?  'Everything Counts' for instance, starts with a fade-in (come on, there's no way it was performed like that at the show).  It just looks like they fought desperately to cram it on the disc, at any cost.<br />After watching some horribly disappointing parts of the concert (on the 2nd DVD), I didn't even bother with the &quot;film&quot; on DVD #1...  To me, &quot;101&quot; means the concert, the event.  It should have been the focus of this 2-DVD set, not as what seems like an afterthought, or a &quot;special feature&quot; on the second disc.  If they butchered the show like that, you can keep disc #1, and I don't care much about disc #2 either, for that matter.<br />Hopefully, with DM's 25th anniversary coming up, they'll listen to the critics and die-hard fans and re-release this concert in all the original glory it deserves.
B00000IN5G|5.0|\\"Hatebreeder,\\" is COB's (Children Of Bodom) second album and it is a mighty sophomore release.  Ripping through songs like, \\"towards dead end,\\" and, \\"Children of Bodom,\\" COB sound more mature on this album than they did on, \\"Something Wild.\\"  The Mixture of power metal (stratovarius, Helloween) with death metal vocals what makes this band stand out from other bands.  While some people would call, \\"Hatebreeder,\\" cheesy and unfulfilling (Metal Maniacs Nov. 1999 pg 54), I personaly think it's one of the best metal cd's I have ever heard. <br />Hailing from finland, a land filled with metal brillance (Kalmah, Sentenced, and Sonata Arctica), COB doesn't flauter in holding the Metal Flag high.  With blazing guitars, awesome riffs, pounding drums, and snarling vocals, \\"Hatebreeder,\\" will please fans of power metal and the gothenburg scene.
0140067477|3.0|One could really take this book as a mixed bag of lessons. In a way, Hoff completely accidentally sets himself up as the ideal example of the opposite of a Taoist viewpoint. His portrayals of Winnie the Pooh as a simple, loving, accepting and calm creature are fairly on the mark. Though a tad simplistic, Pooh is accurately depicted as following several key Taoist virtues that are quite fundemental to such philosophy. At the same time, however, Hoff seems to scream for attention to his \\"higher learning\\" and aesceticism. Seeming to view himself a some type of guru on the subject, he makes a few jabs at Western learning in a painfully typical knee-jerk counterculturism manner. Many authors and artists in the past have attempted to seem profound simply by lashing out at anything conventional. After all, counterintuitive means profound, right? Unfortunately, no. In his rather selfrighteous, condemning, and finger-pointing manner, Hoff inadvertently deepens the lessons of the book. In his pretension, he deepens the contrast of the tranquil and nonjudgemental Pooh, setting him up as all the more admirable and showing just what sort of \\"more enlightened and at peace than thou\\" thinking this peaceful way of life stands against.
B00003CWLF|5.0|After losing her husband in the jungle of India, Anna Leonowens embarks in a journey that will take her to Siam, where she will tutor the oldest son of King Mongkut. Her son, Louis, and two Hindu servants accompany her in this new endeavor. As soon as Anna sets foot in Bangkok, the difference between cultures surges as a predominant element that will remain present throughout the story. Even though the start is rocky, with Anna being called \\"Sir\\" for misogynist reasons and not being given the house she was promised but accommodation in the palace instead, the king discovers quickly the value of this woman that acts very different from what he is used to. That is why he decides that instead of tutoring his oldest son, she will be in charge of teaching all of his children...all 58 of them!<br />The movie evolves around three clear themes. First, the clash of cultures, which is enlightening and entertaining and as the movie evolves so does the acceptance and admiration each of the characters show for the positive points of the other's culture. Second, the relationship between Anna and the king, which starts as annoyance, moves to respect and continues developing from there. Third, the political atmosphere, which is characterized by attacks to Siamese people by Burmese armies, suspected to be supported by no other than the British Empire (the events unfold in 1862).<br /> Although the movie is rather long, the events unfold at a pace that keeps the viewer interested at all times. The music fits the mood of the action perfectly well, and in the proper scenes it is so uplifting that it steals the attention of the viewer. Jodie Foster delivers a well-rounded role, but in my opinion the performance of Chow Yun-Fat is at a higher level. Finally, the scenery and the palaces where the movie develops are absolutely amazing.<br />Overall this is a highly enjoyable movie that will leave you thinking for a while about how every culture has its positive aspects and how, with a little patience, everyone can learn to appreciate this.le patience, everyone can learn to appreciate this.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|This movie was mind-blowing and dissapointing at the same time. It opens well, some war politics, fear amongst other ship leaders, then you get to see Neo bust out some of that great kung fu of his. However, you then spend a long time in Zion. They try to build more layers of suspense and conflict in Zion, and its well intended, but in the end its just very dull and you end up wondering when it will end.<br />When you do get past it all though, Neo goes to visit the orical agian and from there things pick up untill they explode into the most intense and one of the longest chase scenes ever. Its very long and seems unending, but your kept hooked by new developments, it flowers into a 3 way battle for &quot;The Keymaker&quot;, each side wanting him for differnet reasons. Then later narrows down agian to an impressive fight between Morpheus and one of the new agents, in which a katana get involved. They end the movie back in the real world after Neo confronts many new and old foes. It ends so abburbtly that'll you'll definantly want to see the third.<br />Overall its a movie worth buying, but it has many noticable cons to it. Not as god as the first, but worthy of the title Matrix.
6305926794|4.0|First off, this is amazing music.  I didn't give the DVD 5 out of 5 because I think the CD was mixed better (I don't think the orchestra comes through as well on the DVD).  I even think the mixing is different between the 2 discs.  I'm not a big Metallica fan, but I do like there music, and  I am ADDICTED to this album.  I hope this isn't too blasphemous, but I think they should posthumously make Michael Kamen a member of Metallica.  His additions to some of Metallica's songs take them to a whole different level.  I'd have to disagree with Der Kommissar about which fans of Metallica would like this album.  While the originals of some of the songs from the 80's are a bit more stark than the versions in this album, they are no less powerful.  As he points out, Call of Ktulu gets a royal kick in the a** here and is thus one of the best songs on the disk.  IMHO, the BEST song on the disk is a toss up between For Whom the Bell Tolls (although I find it interesting that the only place where the symphony DOESN&quot;T use bells is this song.  The intro is still cool though.) and The Thing That Should Not Be, both songs from the 80's.  If anything the weaker songs are the one's from the 90's.  Enter Sandman completely loses it's momentum in this performance, and the orchestra doesn't quite fit with Sad But True.  Despite that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I remember enjoying this series with the highlight on Starsky's and Hutch's friendship and some great chase scenes.  I couldn't find out much about the DVD set from Columbia's website.  (I am writing this prior to release.)   They did say that the set is 1173 minutes long.  Here is  an episode guide which  I hope will be helpful. I  listed any  guest stars whose names I recognized.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This has to be the best new show to hit the DVD racks. I didn't get to see this show when it was on the air, but was passed the DVD's by a friend. After seeing the first 3 episodes I was hooked. I enjoyed the episodes so much I immediately went out and bought my own set of this collection.<BR>   This show never should have been canceled. I'm a fan for life. I hope to see a follow up movie soon. If anyone in the TV industry has half a brain they will get this show back up and running fast. This show had a minimum of a 7 year run in it.<BR>   If you like Star Trek, Babylon 5, Farscape, Buffy and Angel you will certainly enjoy this show.
B00005JLWN|3.0|For a good sci-fi,action movie you should give Equillibrium a look.Hard to believe this film was not released on the big screen here in NZ.I saw a pirate copy from the internet and immediately took a liking to the story ,characters and action sequences.Christian Bale great as the &quot;Grammaton Cleric&quot;,a fantastic title for an enforcer of law.I bought the DVD as soon as it was available.Recommend people who liked &quot;Blade Runner&quot;,&quot;Matrix&quot;,The Fifth element&quot; and &quot;1984&quot; give it go.
0316666343|4.0|You can believe much of the hype about THE LOVELY BONES. It's a sensitive, keenly-felt novel -- that's the part you can believe in. But then it falls apart into a cliche or two, a disappointment here or there, and you realize it's not the Perfect Novel the hype would have you believe it is.<br />Which is not to say this isn't an excellent book. The first half of it alone is enough to make me apply the word &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  The voice of the dead teenaged narrator is achingly lovely and the bittersweet, wistful-and- accepting by turns tone walks such a fine line, and so skillfully, I practically held my breath as I read. I especially loved the narrator's descriptions of what her personal heaven is like. I kept thinking to myself that Alice Sebold was doing the impossible. I couldn't imagine that she'd be able to sustain this mesmerizing, delicate voice and tone for the entire book.<br />And she doesn't. About halfway through, there's a shift, and some characters make decisions that seemed cliched (the mother and the detective, for example). I also found the ending unsatisfying, with regard to what happens to the narrator's murderer, but that's just me. The ending is certainly realistic, and I can see that it would satisfy many other readers.<br />But these are trifles when you consider the tremendous achievement of the first half of the book. THE LOVELY BONES is worth a whole lot of the vast amount of hype it has gotten.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Finally, the apex of Walt Disney's achievement in animation is delivered on DVD in a breathtaking restoration. Certainly, the much-acclaimed artistic merits of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; come to life here in a form that may actually surpass its original theatrical presentation. But the stunning visuals serve to enhance what is possibly Disney's most accomplished narrative. The subtle character touches and combination of drama, humor, romance and adventure play out in wonderful balance, all leading to an exciting climax that has often been copied in several subsequent Disney films...but never to the same effect. The story takes place within a completely convincing fantasy world, giving a real sense of time and place for the characters - and viewers - to inhabit. Children will never forget the warm and lovely princess, her charmingly realistic young prince, and the greatest villain in Disney animation. Adults will be caught up in a nicely paced story that unfolds with just the right mix of fantasy and magic. <BR>&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;'s story and art touched me as a child, and the film continues to amaze and transport me today. The multiple galleries of production and concept art present a fine display of the substantial talent and imagination the went into the making of this elegant and elaborate film. This is truly a one-of-a-kind animated film that may never be surpassed, and this DVD package deserves a place in any collection of film classics, animated or otherwise.
1401300901|5.0|Holly and Gerry met through mutual friends while still in junior high school.  They became sweethearts as both recognized that they had met their soul mate.  Eventually they married.  He promised Holly that if he ever left her, he would leave her with a list.  Two months later Gerry is dead. Fifteen plus years from they met, thirty years old Gerry was diagnosed with a brain tumor.<br />A few months after Gerry's death, Holly remains grieving and unable to leave her home.  Her mom calls to tell her that she has a package addressed to Holly with the word List above her name.  A stunned Holly realizes somehow Gerry marshaled his energy to give her ten months of lists to help regain her equilibrium because he loved her so much he wanted her to live.  Now Holly begins to follow Gerry's list with one envelop opened per month as he reaches from beyond the grave to help his beloved return to the living.<br />Title aside even if it is the salutation of each of Gerry's notes, PS, I LOVE YOU is a powerful character study that focuses on grieving and healing.  Holly is a fantastic protagonist who begins to mend through the solace provided by Gerry.  Her weird family and her best friends provide sympathy, but cannot help her overcome her dread of life without Gerry.  The hero is incredible as he knew when he will die and planned accordingly for what he could do to get his cherished Holly out of her depression and mourning and into the light of life.  Cecelia Ahern provides a powerful drama that will leave no one dry-eyed.<br />Harriet Klausner
B00005YW4H|4.0|There is no doubt it takes more to being a star than just having a good voice.  Norah has minimal range in her voice. She begins to strain a bit even when she passes only 2 octives. She does have good control. But her style &amp; delivery of these dark alley, 1930'ish ballads leave me wanting more &amp; more of this very talented songstress! An accurate guide of the popularity of an artist is whether anyone is willing to shell out the $dough for the CD's.  Well I not only bought her 2 stateside albums, I also bought her live performance in New Orleans.  Wow!  I haven't bought a secular artists work in 4 or 5 years! Thanks Norah.
B000002UAO|4.0|I used to own the LP and I liked it alot, 'Norwegion Wood&quot;, great song...George on siter...classic...Brian Jones would follow George after this release with his sitar laden song &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, that shows you how much influence The Beatles had an everybody including The Rolling Stones....a classic in its own right....

0679437223|5.0|I first read CATCH-22 when I was young--so long ago, I don't remember when but, probably, when I was in junior high school. It was so powerful that, at that moment, it frightened me.<br />Re-reading the novel as an adult, I realize that author Joseph Heller was a bona fide genius. In hindsight, it is difficult to believe that CATCH-22 won none of the predictable prizes at the time of its original publication.<br />The absurdity of war, and the struggle of the average soldier to survive his tour of duty, never has been more successfully communicated in literature than Heller did here. <br />Forty years after its first publication, the expression &quot;Catch-22&quot; and the concept behind it have become accepted usages in everyday vocabulary, referring to the cycle of irrationality of problem defying the solution, solution causing the problem.<br />The information on the Amazon website that author Heller lives in East Hampton, New York is out-of-date.  Sadly, Heller died in East Hampton a few years ago; as a resident of the town myself, I am certain of this fact.<br />Time has proven that CATCH-22 is classic literature.
B000002UDB|2.0|I wasnt a big fan of this LP but it had its good moments... not many though...I wouldnt recommend...
B0000A02TZ|1.0|There is no way any DVD with mandatory commercials is going to get a good rating from me.  This is one of my favorite movies, but this release was ruined by making it impossible to skip the ads at the beginning.  I won't tell you to not buy this edition, but you should at least complain about it.  If we accept this practice then we're saying its ok for the studios to keep sticking it to us!

B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I wasn't too thrilled but I wsn't let down. the songs are either really good or really bad. The Package is really cool. it sounds cool as hell live. Weak &amp; Powerless can use some work. The Noose is okay. it sort of gets old. Blue is terrible. the opening guitar sounds okay but the rest of it sucks. Vanishing is cool. it was a good intro. A stranger is okay. not great butnot terrible. The Outsider is cool, the only track Maynard screams on. The Cd can do well without Crimes. or the track should have been worked on more before it was released. Te Nurse Who Loved Me is okay. Pet sounds cool but it could use a little bit of work. Lullaby is okay. Gravity is okay I don't like how the resonancein the middle goes no where. in all this Cd has lots of potential. it could have used more studio time. especially with Maynard being high on all his drugs. also with all the interlude type songs there show be more that aren't interlude type.
0385504209|5.0|The book prior to this one is Angels &amp; Demons, by Dan Brown(0671027360), which is also Quite Good.  I read them out of order, that wasn't really a problem though, so don't let that keep you from reading whichever one you get your hands on first!<br />The Da Vinci Code has a fascinating intellectual pace; putting pieces of an over-all puzzle together from histories geniuses, like Da Vinci.  I love learning this stuff; not that I will ever use it, but to find it all ties in somehow ... fascinating!<br />I bought all of the books by Dan Brown, and each held me captive until the very end.<br />We are a book-o-holic family, and usually are granted &quot;private time&quot; when we are near the end of a book; that is the sacred time; no interuptions!  House rule.  These books were virtually &quot;sacred time&quot; through out the books!<br />Digital Fortress was also amazing, for those of us who are on computers (obviously, gentle reader, you are) and each book has unlooked for plot twists, characters that inspire loyalty, or compassion, even outrage.<br />Dan Brown is VERY well researched for each of his books, and you will find yourself learning a lot more of how far we have come with increasingly complex goverment projects.  This isn't the X-files, what he includes in these thrillers Do exist, and have probably already been out-dated.<br />Love a puzzle?  Love intrigue, history, mystery, tightly woven plots?  These are for You.<br />As always, I mention the font, and the ease or difficulty the print will give to those with less than perfect vision, or who are prone to head-aches from eye-strain.<br />This has an exellent font, no problems!  The same can be said for each of his publications.<br />The only downside is now I am spoiled and want more!<br />Mr Brown, if you please?

B00003CXD5|5.0|Along with the great Erich von Stroheim classic GREED (which tragically exists only in a greatly abridged version, and which was based on the haunting Frank Norris novel MCTEAGUE), this is the most powerful movie ever made on the destructive power of greed.<br />THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE is rightfully considered one of the greatest American films, and is also yet another in a string of first-rate collaborations between John Huston and Humphrey Bogart.  Although Bogart made many superb films in the forties and fifties, a disproportionate number were with Huston, including the film that made him a star, THE MALTESE FALCON, and the film that garnered Bogie his only Oscar, THE AFRICAN QUEEN.<br />The cast consists primarily of three drifters who want to hit it rich in Mexico.  Bogart plays Fred C. Dobbs, in one of the greatest roles of his career.  The character of Bob Curtin is played by Tim Holt, a &quot;B&quot; actor (in the quite literal sense of having acted in scores of &quot;B&quot; pictures) who nonetheless managed to get parts in some exceptionally great films, notably this one, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE, as well as a small role in STAGECOACH (he plays the cavalry commander who rides a short distance with the stagecoach before departing).  Both Bogart and Holt are excellent, but the film is more or less stolen by the great Walter Huston, John's father, in the last great role in a long and distinguished career as the veteran prospector Howard.<br />The film was based on a very great novel by the same title by one of the most reclusive authors in the history of literature.  During his lifetime, the identify of B. Traven was unknown.  If you find dust jackets for printings of his novels from the forties and fifties and sixties, the biographical details are something out of science fiction.  Some even claimed that he was Jack London, living in Mexico after having faked his own death!  Eventually, investigators went to Mexico after his death and searched exhaustively for the secrets to his identity.  He turned out to be an ex-patriot German (not a surprise, since his books were always published in Germany before the United States) named Rex Marut.  When John Huston went down to Mexico to film THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE, he attempted to arrange a meeting with B. Traven, but was informed that he was to meet with Traven's representative Hal Croves instead.  There is a wonderful photograph that exists of John Huston and &quot;Hal Groves&quot; talking.  As he talked with Croves, Huston began to suspect that he was in fact B. Traven himself, though he was unable to voice his suspicion.  Years later, it was confirmed to Huston that Hal Groves was yet another alias for Ret Marut a.k.a. B. Traven.  Given this fascinating story, it would have been wonder if they could have included as one of the extras for the DVD set the 60-minute documentary THE MAN WHO WAS B. TRAVEN.  The extras are good, but this would have been a wonderful addition.<br />Filming THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE in 1948 was a fascinating choice by John Huston.  In 1947, when they were filming, a sharp shift to the political right was clearly discernable.  Whereas Hollywood in the 1930s had been largely leftist, in the late forties it was unquestionably right wing.  Among directors especially, there were virtually no exceptions, though two prominent directors persisted in their leftist beliefs:  one was the great Billy Wilder and the other was John Huston.  B. Traven himself was a liberal anarchist populist (it is widely thought he was self-exiled in Mexico because of previous political activity), and the book, as does the movie, is an attack on the materialist values driving Western civilization.  Not many directors would have had the courage in 1947 (it was released in January 1948) to make a movie about the evils of greed, but Huston was one who did.  Likewise, Bogart was one of the more politically liberal actors in Hollywood, and wasunafraid of being in a movie with the message that this one contained.<br />The film is highly unusual in having been filmed primarily on location in Mexico, unlike most Hollywood films, which would merely film in some southern California location.  This imparts a look to the film that sets it apart fromAlso unlike most Hollywood films, Huston actually employed Hispanic actors in Hispanic roles.  This allowed one veteran Mexican character actor, Alfonso Bedoya, to deliver one of the most famous lines in the history of the movies, when he tells Fred C. Dobbs, &quot;Badges?

B00003CXI0|3.0|The Harry Potter series of books has been one of the most enjoyable pieces of communication tools between my son and I since, my son was 11 years old. My son is now 14 years old. <br />We have read the books, frequently listen to the audio versions read by Jim Dale, and own each of the movies (DVD) released to date. Quite frankly, in my opinion, neither of the movies can compare, or exceed the magical rendition of Jim Dale's reading of the adventures.<br />We agree with a previous reviewer, that the Sorcerer's Stone movie loses the true feeling of her book, its pace, and its charm. We too really didn't understand the sensless changes made for the movie, like changing the color of the Dursley's hair, from Light to Dark. And just why did the \\"bearly acceptable\\" Hagrid have to blurt out, \\"your a wizard Harry\\" in such a deflating fashion. <br />In my opinion any director of any of the Potter movies will be hard pressed to capture the true feeling of the book on film. I challenge any to compare with Jim Dales' audio reading.(PLEASE!!)<br />In all fairness without a doubt, the movie in a way the books could not, brought to life the Quidditch game. Overall, We think this movie would make a good addition to one's Potter library, but it is totally unnecessary for one to see it to capture the true Potter magic.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I definately like this band.  They are the best band that imitates that Joy Division kind of atmosphere sound.  The other are Longwave and The Stills I'd say.  However, both of those bands think they sound like JD by just making a big wall of sound which is not what JD was about.  Interpol is therefore the best since they have a sparse sound for most of their songs at least and they have almost perfected that depressing JD sound that everyone tells me they have.  On the lyrics side, I'd have to say that these guys definately have the depressing words down cold.  They sound kind of mechanical even though they are often about love of some kind.  And they always result in something bad - death for example.  I appreciate the bass player because he really compliments the singer's voice and makes the music sound whole even though not much is going on.  THe minimalist drumming also adds to this.  Overall, an excellent package (I'd like to give it a 4.5 stars, but unfortuantely that is impossible).
B00005JME0|1.0|Why is the trailer excellent?  It decieves you into thinking that certain events happen out of order and at least that mislead has brought some attention to the film because otherwise this fish is dead in the water.  The biggest reason that I can point to the directing.  It's absolutely terrible.  I never had a sense of place within this film whether it was outside, inside, obviously on a set.  These places didn't feel like anything.  The film doesn't establish moods, or opinions about much of anything and that is the fault of the director. I didn't sense any kind of importance, or relevance to the events that happened within the first five minutes and within ten I was passively wishing this was over.  The editing was cold and mechanical when the only way that this would've worked would've been as a personal study (it doesn't the script, or brains to put off a competent sci fi, I'll get to that later).  Sound is the only thing the directors did partially well.  I say partially because when the actors couldn't keep attention on the screen the sound jumped out and got it, but after awhile it became revealed as a cheap trick to simply replace emotional development. What's worse is that in some scenes which are meant to be disturbing, they have surround sound of a crowd laughing and it's so loud that it actually sounds like the crowd in the theater is laughing at the film, just plain bad.  As for the acting, I think that the direction does the performances a disservice, but the casting director is just as much to blame for some obvious miscasts, or maybe they wouldn't be miscasts if the script gave them something interesting to say, or if it was plausible and the actors were being directed by good artists.  There are some whole within the plot and I'm sure that they're intentional.  1) If his father had this power to travel back in time than why is it that the blackouts that Kutcher's character indures within his life are only his own tamperings later in life. 2)If he simply goes back by concentrating on the events that happened in his journals which are actually his memories then why can't he go back by simply remembering?  3)what seven year old boy keeps a journal in today's day and age? 4)If he wrote all of these old journals for such a long time, why is it that he never reads them until after the blackouts stop? 5)If he can go back through time and change events, therefore changing history and his memories then it's not possible that he could save those memories of himself changing, or that they had been changed at all.  He might even forget about his ability to change things, otherwise, it doesn't make sense for his brain to be bleeding. 6)The quote at the beginning suggests that the butterfly effect can be catstrophic and because its effects are limited to the lives of only a few people and not the surroundings and/or entire world it really doesn't fulfill its potential. Ditto on the movie, but Kutcher was a passable actor in the main role. Also, the movie is an empty nuggett because it goes out of its way at the end to say that certain talents are better left unused, if that's the lesson then why waste my time showing them being used haphazardly and only having them work out at the end in service of the plot? On the plus side, I didn't hate it and just felt empty at the end, in a sedated way.
B000001ELF|2.0|Not really many comments for the album.  Vocally, Ace was probably the weakest in the band.  However, &quot;New York Groove&quot; hit during the disco era with it's twangy guitar riffs - great for the period.  What I can't believe is the fact that there is no sound clip for the song here.  Apparently, it was not an old Kiss fan who wrote this page.  &quot;New York Groove&quot; made it to #13 in Billboard's 1979 Pop Singles chart.<BR>     In addition, the Gene Simmons solo effort should be packaged with Ace's efffort for your two-album savings deal.  (The Paul Stanley album had no hits that I'm aware of and my Kiss-fan friends &amp; I hated it!)  Gene Simmons' &quot;Radioactive&quot; only made it to #47 in the same chart during 1979, however the album itself went to #22 in Pop Albums.<br />Just some marketing hints.
B000002UJQ|5.0|&quot;Ok Computer&quot; perfectly conveys the &quot;double dual&quot; that is living in the most technologically advanced time in history, amid all the power and the wealth, while also struggling to understand and express our emotions in a meaningful way.

0553208845|2.0|I admit I did not like this book.  I finished it unsatisfied, like I'd missed something.  Usually I read books for the characters, and this book was not character driven in any kind of intimate way.  The language is sparse, and it failed to draw me in with its heavily didactic tone.  It really isn't so much of a novel as it is a parable designed to outline the author's basic philosophy.  And it's message is a rather simple one: \\"Wisdom cannot be taught.\\"<br />One reviewer wrote that the book is \\"definitely for those new to spiritual self-examination,\\" and I'd have to agree with that statement.  It is an interesting view of Buddhism, but it's very European and can't be taken too authentically as it is an outsider's view looking in on Buddhist/Indian culture.<br />For me, the book was almost painful in the way that Siddhartha could not deal with happiness.  Any time he acheived a modicum of happiness with his life, he became unhappy because he was happy.  I could not deal with his ungrateful attitude.  It quite literally left me with a frustrated feeling.  Since the book was meant to be a parable (or a recitation of a belief), the reader never really gets to know Siddhartha, so he ends up coming across as a self-centered [man].  He liked to listen to himself talk; he used people and was never grateful for their affection for him.  He was a seeker, and he simply could not stop seeking no matter what it meant for anyone.  He didn't care about people; he cared about his search.<br />I will admit, however, that there were bits and pieces of the book that I did appreciate.  I liked Siddhartha's appreciation of the river, and I enjoyed reading the part where he and the ferryman talked about listening to the river.  This is exactly the sort of thing that I was hoping to find in this book.  But it was a brief passage and gave way to the cliched doctrine that filled the rest of the book.<br />The book seemed to be about being true to one's self above all others, that this is the path of wisdom.  This message did not speak to me in any way.is is the path of wisdom.  This message did not speak to me in any way.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|Alice sits with her tutor outdoors, but she is bored with the books lacking pictures.  She begins to pay more attention to her cat as she suddenly catches a glimpse of a dressed rabbit.  The rabbit grabs her curiosity and she follows the rabbit into a hole.  In the hole she trips and she falls into what seems to be an abyss that leads to a fantasy land where things are not as they appear, and they appear as she has never known before.  Alice in Wonderland is based on Lewis Carroll's novel with the same name and his story brings the audience through a fantastic adventure where Alice's curiosity brings several philosophical ideas in regards to general curiosity.  The film is an interesting adventure for both young and old, as it unveils adult contemporary themes as well as eye-catching phenomena for the young, which ends in a marvelous, yet odd, cinematic experience.
B00009QG73|5.0|I'm a roxy fan, but not a fanatic.  I own 4 of their CD's and one of them is a best of, and two of them I've only listened to once.  I own a couple of concert DVD's and wasn't too hip on live music because I always liked the studio cuts better.  What I'm trying to say is I wasn't sure if I would like this DVD...But, never having seen Roxy in person, I wanted to check it out.  <BR>Boy was I pleased!  I thought the mixing was excellent for a live cut.  You could hear every one of the little percussion instruments (which have names, and everyone knows what they sound like, but no one knows what they're called)and Roxy uses them all.  I watched it on my cheap Sanyo DVD player and Sanyo 25\\" screen and listened through my 12 year old receiver through 900mHz cordless headphones (my girlfriend was sleeping).  You know the hiss they can give you if you use 900MHz cordless phones and still thought the sound was good.  Now maybe I'm a little deaf from too loud of music, or my ears are not trained for discerning great from mediocre sound quality, but I found myself at times with goosebumps and wanting to stand up and cheer.  <br />I can hear Bryan Ferry saying (in the words of Elwood Blues) \\"I'm getting the band back together.\\"  The band members are obviously older, they haven't toured together since 1986 or so, but I get the feeling with no new material, this may be the last time any of us not fortunate enough to see this tour, may ever get to see them.  In my mind, they are one of the most unique sounds of many of our popular music histories that I am so glad I have a copy to enjoy and share with others who ask \\"What was Roxy Music like?\\"
0316743003|5.0|Skunk works is the true story behind the coolest, high tech, top secret, aerospace engineering division operated by the Lockheed Martin corporation.  Forged by legendary U. Michigan alumnus Kelly Johnson, the Skunk Works has created the coolest planes of recent memory, including the SR-71 Blackbird (currently visible on the flight deck of the Intrepid Aircraft Carrier in NYC), the F117A Stealth Fighter, and the U2 spy plane.  The F22 Raptor and the Joint Strike Fighter are also creations of the Skunk Works, but are not covered in this autobiography written by the successor to Kelly Johnson, Ben Rich.  <BR>     This quick read is well worth your while for a couple of reasons.  First, the stories behind the creation of these planes is very interesting.  For example, the Skunk Works engineers found the mathematical key to the stealth design buried within an obscure physics journal originally published in Russian. Oddly, the Russians military never capitalized on the principle, despite urgings from the article's Russian author. Furthermore, when the stealth plane was first designed and kept in a secret hanger infested with some bats, the bats couldn't detect the plane with their &quot;sonar-like&quot; sense, and they ended up crashing into it.<BR>     The book also makes for excellent military and therefore world history.  Accomplishments of the U2 spy plane and the F117-A Stealth Fighter are covered in depth and literally changed the course of world events during the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the Korean War, the Gulf War, and other skirmishes.  Many interesting, behind the scenes (formerly classified?) missions are also revealed in this book.  Ben Rich also speculates on the future types of planes currently on the minds of engineers at the Skunk Works, and the implications will change how wars are fought in the future. <BR>     For readers who liked this book, NOVA recently published a video on the creation of the Joint Strike Fighter, a contract fought over between the Skunk Works and the Phantom Works of Boeing.  These do all fighters are amazing, and this video is definately worth watching for those who enjoyed &quot;Skunk Works.&quot;
B00006879E|3.0|I haven't bought this album, but I've heard a few of their songs, and see that maybe music hasn't dug itself so low that it cannot return.  I'm not saying their stuff is any good, but it may bring on a new-wave rebirth.  Again, I'm not saying that new-wave would be all that good, but it's a thousand times better than what the radio has been spitting out for the past 20 years.  And what happens when the country is enthralled in the open frontiers of new-wave?  Some real music just might sneak through.  I hope that more bands like Dexy's Midnight Runners (although I know this will not be the case) will sprout up, and remind us of what music is about.  I want to listen to a song, and not just hear someone singing along with a drum beat, while random notes play out of a synthesizer/guitar, which is what all music today is (with exception to Dexy's, who are, in fact, still running).
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I use to be a big fan of Britney, but now shes all about being sexy. I really don't know much about this CD, some of the songs may be actually good. But, since I no longer like her, especially for her appearal, I don't take the time to listen to her music anymore.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|this movie was so stupid. i maybe cracked a smile once, MAYBE. out of the 3 other people who watched this movie with me, exactly 0 people thought it was good. it'll be going on eBay. <br />i love ben stiller, he absolutely cracks me up. owen wilson is pretty funny too, but this movie has a dumb plot (if you could call it that) and dumb, corny humor. ben stiller is hilarious in 'there's something about mary' and 'meet the parents' because he is NOT TRYING TO BE. i felt as if the actors were trying too hard to be silly and it was just not working. <br />if you want to see movies that truly make you laugh and have funny plots, see 'meet the parents' and 'there's something about mary' instead. don't waste anything on this movie.

This movie is a definite must see, (some may have to watch it twice), but the ending is one of the best twisters of all time!

0060512806|5.0|I was one of those people who only liked the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; science-fiction epics by the old masters of science-fiction books, but, after reading &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and some other Neal Stephensen books, I have come to really like the sub-genre known as cyberpunk. I have purchased and am reading &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, and &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;, even though it's not a Stephenson book, it is a cyberpunk book. Kudos to Stephensen!
B000089J0R|5.0|I don't think this world has yet seen a faster band....... At least in power metal.  First off, I want to state that this band sounds a bit like Rhapsody + Lost Horizon.  Valley of the Damned reminds me more or Lost Horizon's first album - Awakening the World.  And boy did that CD ever \\"awaken the world\\"!  There are next to no keyboards on this album (Valley).  Many of the songs are about 6:15 long, but the first track is the shortest I've ever heard at 0:13.  You are getting your money's worth for 9 tracks.  The title track is a wonder - one of a couple over 7 minutes.  Revelations was released as a demo when the band's name was Dragon Heart.  That song is also pretty good.  Every song except for thae ballad, Starfire, is hyper speed.  By that I mean about the speed of Father Time by Stratovarius.  Imagine the speed of Rhapsody's fastest songs and Skylark's fastest songs with an even faster bass.  That's how fast this band plays!  <br />So how good actually are these 8 songs?  I love 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.  Revelations isn't as good as these, in my opinion.  Starfire is so hard to get into because its so much slower than the other songs!  I'd say that its an okay ballad.  Track 8 is like Starfire in quality.  <br />I don't think the production for this album is that great, but the writing talent makes up for it.  Think of how we still love Images in Worlds by Dream Theater (is that what its called?  Can't remember.......).  Its because of how good it is - not the production.  I would recommend Dragonforce to about anybody.  There aren't any bands who sound like Dragonforce.  Some power metal bands I've heard include Hammerfall, Helloween, Brainstorm, Blind Guardian, Grave Digger, Primal Fear, Sinergy, Manowar, and Falconer, to name a few.  Nobody sounds like Dragonforce.  <br />When you get the time, go read some of my other reviews and say if they helped you or not.
0385504209|3.0|I am an art major, and had just completed art history on the the Renaissance when I got this book from the library.  My friends had told me wonderful things about it, and I was excited to read it.  I did indeed find it fascinating, but not for the story line.  In fact, the detective story was cookie cutter, and I found that I could predict things several chapters before they actually happened.  No, the intruiging part for me was the immaculate research on Da Vinci and the secret society and the concept of the holy grail that Dan Brown did.  It was the first time I had been exposed to these ideas, and found them impecably interesting.  It was like taking a history class in a book, where learning is made more interesting.  I'm not sure that I believe everything that he wrote is true, but it is certainly another way to look at certain events, and it is something to keep in mind.  I am eager to learn more on the subject.
B00005V331|5.0|\\"Welcome To Hell\\" is one of the most important albums i nthe development and formation of metal, esentially kick starting speed/thrash metal.<br /><br />Up until this point nothing in metal nothing had the sheer intensity and raw aggression that this album did. This album heavily influenced and paved the way for many bands, whether it be Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, or Exodus, etc.. Not to mention the influence Venom had, as well as basically creating black metal, on some of those early bands like Bathory and Mayhem. Some of their infulence can even be heard on Possessed's \\"Seven Churches\\".<br /><br />Some really stand out tracks on this are: \\"Live Like An Angel (Die Like A Devil)\\" which is a perfectly executed thrasher (and actually shows how well they can paly believe it or not), \\"Witching Hour\\" is most certainly one of the first thrash metal classics. \\"In League With Satan\\", which contains some awesome almost tribal beats and Cronos growling at his most evil making for a pure early black metal classic, the chaotic \\"Red Light Fever\\", and of course the flesh ripping \\"Poison\\" which is like Motorhead taken to the tenth power of thrash.<br /><br />Now some points that may throw people are off is the muddy production obviously, and  some of the playing is sloppy at times and an occasional out of tune guitar, but when I listen to this album the raw balls out intensity of it, and I feel the same way I did about it the first time i listened to this album for the first time. If you don't have this, GET IT!!!
B00008EYA5|1.0|I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to blockbuster summer movies.  I don't expect the greatest scripts or characters or plot, I just want to be entertained.  SWAT let me down on all accounts and was practically begging for me to see its many flaws.<br />The movie is good at the beginning, though.  It opens with bank robbers taking hostages and the SWAT team moving in and taking out the robbers one by one.  Colin Ferrel's character disobeys orders but turns on his partner in order to stay on the SWAT team.  Then the movie begins and that's when it breaks down.<br />Samuel L Jackson arrives on the scene as a supposed ex-SWAT member who is brought back to restore dignity to the LAPD.  All this is covered in one line uttered by Jackson's superior, who happens to hate him and hopes he fails.  I have no clue why a separate SWAT team was needed to be formed when the regular SWAT team seemed to be functioning quite well.<br />Jackson is allowed to choose his own team and much is made in the movie of him choosing each member.  Jackson's superior warns that if Jackson picks the wrong team, it'll end his career.<br />The middle of the movie involves the training of the team.  On the way home from training, they stumble on a worldwide fugitive.  Through a forced and unbelievable plot, it becomes Jackson's young, inexperienced SWAT team's responsibility to transport the prisoner.  Here's where I started having doubts.<br />The extended climax of the movie involves Jackson, Ferrell, Michelle Rodriquez and LL Cool J trying to transport the prisoner while all types of thugs try to break him free.<br />There is a plot twist at the end where Jackson's team choosing ability is called into question, yet this has no repercussions in the movie, and it also calls into doubt the entire first half of the film when Jackson carefully chose his team.  How bad could he be?<br />Why is this young inexperienced SWAT team in charge of the prison transfer.  Is that what SWAT teams really do.  I didn't think so.<br />The final fight between Ferrell and the last bad guy is horribly filmed in the darkness of a train yard.  One minute the characters are in the open, the next they are on a train car.  The editing is jumpy and confusing, and I didn't really care what happened.<br />When I think of SWAT, I think of the beginning of the movie when they save hostages from a terrorist situation with their long-range shooting and special skill.  The entire climax of the movie is about cops transporting a prisoner, certainly not worthy of a SWAT team.  This is a bad movie with no character development.  Don't buy it.didn't think so.    <br />The final fight between Ferrell and the last bad guy is horribly filmed in the darkness of a train yard.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Going to a performing arts school, and being a tremendous broadway fan, I can say it's hard to vocally beat this musical in a cast recording. &quot;Songs For A New World&quot;... maybe. &quot;Aida&quot;... coming close. Idina Menzel gives me chills every time I hear &quot;Defying Gravity.&quot; You'll know what I mean when you hear the last 20 seconds of the piece. Overall, a hilarious (&quot;Popular&quot;) and heartfelt (&quot;For Good&quot;) show, with voices to boot. Get it, and love it... for good.
0385335482|4.0|For me, the best things about Becky are the conversations she has with herself about whatever's foremost on her mind at any given moment, and the way her imagination runs away with her only to have reality tap her on the shoulder, sometimes after she's momentarily forgotten where the line is between the two. My best friend and I have laughed about sharing that common trait between us for years, and I'm going to make sure she reads this book - Becky's musings to herself sound a lot like some of the the emails we send each other!<br />Becky's being a shopaholic is mostly a vehicle to introduce us to this character, who is, when we meet her, more than a little at sea about where she's going in life, and who shares with us her obsessions and neuroses about whatever's going on at the moment - her love life, her money, her bills, her career, her parents, her neighbors, her best friend. She also sometimes shares with us, between chapters, letters she's received from creditors, which made me flinch while I was laughing, having once been in similar shoes (mercifully a long time ago).<br />I thoroughly enjoyed myself from cover to cover, and laughed out loud several times throughout this book. My highest praise is that I hated to see it end, even though the ending was a little bit pat and predictable. <br />If you're like me and don't have a lot of time for pleasure reading, but miss it a lot, this is a good choice. It's a fast read and a lot of fun.

B00005JLXE|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre and was not happy with it.  I bought the DVD for my husband and I gave it a second viewing thinking maybe I'd like it the second time around.   It only convinced me of what a waste of about 2 hours it was.  The scenes are rushed, the story weak.  I hated the whole Murdock/Electra romance. It was WAY TOO RUSHED!!!!!  Even the way he met her and their duel just so he could get her name was extremely stupid and pointless. Then, the second time he meets her, they end up in bed together! YIKES!   There was NO character development and the whole movie was rushed.  Even the Kingpin/Daredevil face-off left something to be desired.  The only saving factor was Bullseye.  Done the right way, this movie could have been great. I was bored to tears seeing this in the theatre and seeing it again on DVD only re-enforced my opinion.  I absolutely hate this movie and would not recommend buying the DVD. rent it, but do not buy it.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I never knew this man.<br />I never liked country music.<br />I might have never even heard a thing he did.<br />Except that I had a Computer Science professor, an amiable Irish eccentric who was fond of playing music videos on the computer projection-monitor in the minutes before class started.<br />His tastes were fairly eclectic, and on the typical day, about half the class would like what he played, and be listening to it, and the other half would find it not to their taste, and be talking amoungst themselves.<br />One day, he turned a Nine Inch Nails song. Only it wasn't.<br />No one talked that day. We were all silent, riveted, as an aging and clearly infirm man, a stranger to us, lent, with the aid only of a single guitar, such musical skill and such genuine passion to the words we already knew, that it seemed we were hearing them for the first time. <br />The final word died away into an electric silence, but it was many moments before the spell was broken, and someone said &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />It was all that really needed to be said.<br />(And so I went in search of the rest of his work...)
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie is very good and does not drag at any part.  I do wish that they had included a short 5 - 10 minute scene at the start where students are in the philosophy class discussing the butterfly effect with a bit more detail.  Other than that one little change I'd make, everything else about this movie is great, especially the score.  Great acting from a mediocre cast... I never thought I'd see it.
6305263248|4.0|Robert De Niro plays the ronin (a masterless samurai), a US spy who feels superfluous with the end of the Cold War. He joins a team of a bunch of guys like himself, all from the same background, and is hired by a woman (there's always a woman, isn't there?) to lift a suitcase of importance to two improbably dissimilar foes: Irish terrorists and the Russian mafia. As the movie follows the path of that suitcase, often handcuffed to some suited guy's wrist, more twists and possibilities appear than are factually believable.<BR>But that's not what it's all about, not really. It's all about tension, shoot-em-up scenes, explosions, deception, a helluva terrific car chase (as obligatory as the woman in such films)...<BR>Anyway, it's good, it's exciting, it's intense. If you haven't seen it, do.

B000022TSY|5.0|What an iconic movie this one was. For viewers who werent even alive during the 60s, this incredible and unforgettable film with Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson is an important one to watch. For those of us who can remember that era all too well, its worth a trip down memory lane. <BR>Captain America (Fonda) and his buddy (Hopper, playing a paranoid Billy) set out on long, loud, flashy motorcycles, heading across the heartland of the US. Along the way, they pick up a drunk (Nicholson) in a small town and turn him on to, well, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. <BR>A horrifying and all-too-plausible ending is what the movie is really about.<BR>If youve never seen it, see it now; if you saw it way back when, see it again. And notice how YOUNG these guys look. Its scary.
0060536977|4.0|I am an audio book &quot;reader&quot;. I have a 35-minute ride to work each day and love using my time productively by listening to books on CD. Since most reviewers read books the traditional way -- which supposedly explains why I have to pay extra for audio books :) -- reviews are almost always for the printed version.  Thus, I'm left to cross my fingers and hope for a good reader. I always find myself wishing for information on the quality of the reader's presentation. So, for this review, I'm focusing on the audio presentation, since the various other reviewers have covered the content of the book in great depth. My dream scenario is when the author reads the book. Somehow I equate this with being as close as possible to being inside their head. Alas, not all writers are good readers, so thank God there are excellent readers like Leonard Robert Sean. I really enjoyed his presentation. His vocal inflection was great, and his voice is very pleasant. He did a great job with the various characters in the story. So, fear not, my fellow audio format enthusiast, the presentation is extremely well done for Prey. As for the story, I liked it a lot. I couldn't wait to go to (and leave) work each day so I could hear what would happen next in the story. The whole premise is especially worrisome since nanotechnology is real and nanoparticles already exist in our world today. Hopefully our government has responsible people involved. Or maybe we are all already infected :) Bottom line: The audio presentation rates &quot;5&quot; stars and the story rates &quot;4&quot; stars. Average them up, and you get 4.5 stars. Since Amazon doesn't offer me that choice, it seems fairest to let my ranking reflect the &quot;4&quot; stars for the story itself. Enjoy!!!
B00005JKN9|3.0|\\"Mixed reviews,\\" I guess, best describes it. Gangs of New York strives to portray the chaos of street (\\"gang\\") warfare in NY in the mid-19th century. On the plus side, there's director Scorsess and the cast, including Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis. On the minus side, there's also the cast, including monumentally miscast Leonardo DiCaprio. The attempt is to portray the rough and raucous underbelly of American history. This portrayal is probably authentic and certainly spectacular. It's the story of vengeance betw Irish Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) and Bill Cutting (Day-Lewis), his father's murderer. <BR>Have a go. See what you think. I'm still not sure how to rate this one.
B00004Z459|5.0|It's funny. I got into them before everybody else did. I purchased this CD before everyone else did. They were even my favorite band at one point until they became overplayed on the radio and MTV and became everyone else's favorite band.<br />What's also funny is that I think most of the people on here that gave it a 1-star review, do that only because Linkin Park is popular, but forget to realize this that this album was created before fame. However, a 1-star for their latest release, Meteora, is justifiable, seeing how they tried to recreate Hybrid Theory.<br />But still, I have to rate Hybrid Theory on how much I enjoy the album, thus the 5 stars. Very enjoyable. Pretty good musicianship, creativity, and at least SOME originality. Too bad that all went away on Meteora. Sometimes I wish Linkin Park never got really popular, because than they would still be good.

B00004YRQA|4.0|The 8mb memory card gets the job done, but it is very necessary if you want to enjoy your PS2. If you are planning on buying many games, then you will need two. I'm on my second card already, so if you're a heavy gamer, plan on running out of memory.<br />Some negatives, though, are the price and the packaging. So expensive! Amazon has a good price, though. I've seen more expensive. I guess Sony jacks up the price, since you need it if you want any enjoyment out of your games... any of them!<br />And you wouldn't believe how hard the packaging is. You need a grown adult with flexable hands to get the card out. Be careful, because kids might cut themselves on the plastic, or might get migraines from trying to figure out how to get the memory card out of the package.<br />However, the memory card gets the job done and is pretty reliable. I've had my first one for about 8 months and I haven't had any problems.

And the songs in general are more conventionally arranged with a real chorus and verse.   Air makes great music but the silly lyrics bring my score way down here. Air should look to the band &quot;Luna&quot; about how to make coy lyrics that are also intentionally and successfully ironic. Or keep the lyrics out of the music alltogether.
0743244249|4.0|The dismissive reviews I read of Cosmopolis made me hesitate to buy it.  After reading a library copy, I  bought Cosmopolis to read a second time.  I figure buying the book is the best vote cast in its favor.<br />Cosmopolis is not a facile entertainment.  It requires work on the reader's part.  Delillo is exploring territory that, by its nature, eludes description.  The mind has well-evolved strategies for perceiving and reacting to the world; non-rational strategies largely inaccessible to waking consciousness; strategies that worked for millennia, now effectively shunted aside and concealed from view - even while they operate continuously in clandestine ways.  How do you view or talk about this hidden stuff?  You can't name it because language by nature is rational and this, by its nature, is not.  <br />Delillo gives us a metaphor.  Cosmopolis.  It is incongruous.  It doesn't match our world or its usual fictionalized portraits.  The reader tries to fit the world s/he knows with the metaphor - it can't be done, it's incongruous.  But in trying, the reader starts to sense an opening into something that is neither our world nor its metaphor Cosmopolis, something rising out of the tension between them.  <br />The book is an exploration into the tension between the normal surface of things and an animating underworld we know is there but hardly know.  Reading, rereading Cosmopolis, thinking about it is like opening a door in the mind that leads to rooms not often visited.
B00006690G|1.0|This is just fast talking and rhyming with bad beats and rhythmns in the background. Eminem has no talent at all. He talks about how bad his life was growing up and how it still is bad. His life is fine, he makes lots of money and he is famous. He should stop complaining. Why doesn't he go try to live in a third world country and see how bad his life would be then! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Few directors are qualified to take up the reins of Cameron's classic Terminator film mythology.  T3 director Mostow does a very impressive and capable job, however, and keeps the story plugging along at a fairly tight clip.  With a running time of just under 105 minutes, the movie is trimmed of any fat or scenes of forced sentimentality (like the ones that slowed down T2 a bit).<br />The chase scene in the first act, in which the TX chases our heroes in a 160-ton crane truck, is such a masterful blend of live-action and CGI that it defies criticism on any level.  The directory commentary on the DVD reveals that the sequence was originally intended to be shot at night, but the filming schedule necessitated a Summertime shoot, and the nights were just too short for the number of shooting days that would have been needed.<br />Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl for this movie.  Thank goodness!  Stahl is a MUCH, MUCH better actor - Furlong just grew tiresome by the end of T2.<br />Best part about this film:  the story thread continues to its only logical conclusion, if not the necessarily upbeat one.  I for one would have felt cheated if the film had ended any other way.  T3's storyline stays true to the apocalyptic vision set up by the first two films.  AND, it leaves open the opportunity for a 4th film.  Yes, the story could support another installment.  Whether Arnold, Cameron, Mostow, Gale Anne Hurd, or other franchise principals would get on board for #4 remains to be seen.  But I'd love to know where the story goes from here.<br />As for the DVD:  the majority of the Disc 2 extras look as if they were culled from an Electronic Press Kit.  Where is Van Ling (mastermind behind the special edition DVD extras in &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;T2&quot;) when we need him?<br />The &quot;create your own effects sequence&quot; extra is majorly lame.  Majorly.<br />In short, you should buy this DVD to enjoy the movie but not get too excited about the anemic extras.  And there were DEFINITELY not enough extras to merit the second disc.  Fortunately the inclusion of a second disc didn't seem to affect the movie's retail price.<br />I enjoyed this film in the theatres last summer, but I enjoyed it even more on DVD when I viewed it with a less-critical pair of eyes.  12 years was a long time to wait for another &quot;Terminator&quot; film, so starting with my second viewing of this film I could evaluate it more on its own terms and not in comparison to &quot;T2&quot;.mic extras.

B00000373U|5.0|Recently I looked through all of the CD's that I have reviewed and I realized that, for the most part, I never review the albums that mean the most to me. Those albums that strike a chord deep in my heart and that have true meaning in my life, not just records that are catchy and fun to have on in the background. Maybe it's because I am worried I won't be able to do them justice? Or maybe I'm worried that I'll detract from the special feeling that comes each time I listen to it if I analyze it too much. More likely than not though, I think I never discuss these albums because they are personal and private and something I want to keep to myself.<br />However, in light of recent events I feel like I need to say something about Elliott Smith's work and how devestatingly beautiful it is. I'm not going to try to analyze anything here or try to come up with creative metaphors for his sound. I just want to make it clear that I absolutely love everything he's done. <br />Either/Or is my favorite of his albums, and is tremendous through and through. It is raw and beautiful in a disturbing fashion. Listening to his simple melodies and open-hearted lyrics is both therapeutic as well as haunting and it is so tragic that more people never were tuned in to his amazing work.<br />Maybe it's better that way though? Elliott never wanted the spotlight or the fame. He wanted his life to be simple, quiet, and held close to himself. Maybe that's how his records should be for those of us who do treasure them.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I was so excited to see that Gavin made it on to One Tree Hill and performed his song but then I completely forgot what this ment. Gavin was one of the industry's best kept secrets and everyone on here was writing great reviews about what a great treasure this album was. However know that people know him they are going to flood his album with 1 star reviews when the openly admit they haven't even heard the album. <br />Please believe me when I say this album is brilliant. The lyrics are fantastic and Gavin is a truly gifted vocalist and I'm honored to have such an amazing album in my collection. Forget the stupid reviews others have written this album is a guaranteed satisfaction and is one of the best records u will ever hear.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Who says that sequels suck? With the exception of &quot;Soar&quot; &amp; &quot;Underappreciated&quot; Xtina's sophomore release Stripped is a masterpiece. She sounds fantastic, her look &amp; attitude adjustments are fitting, and with songs such as &quot;Walk Away&quot;, &quot;Make Over&quot; &amp; &quot;Cruz&quot; she shows that she is so much more than what critics expected of her. This album is a up close and personal look into her life ('I'm Ok', 'Beautiful') and will also make you wanna dance ('Dirrty' &amp; 'Get Mine Get Yours) and feel inspired ('The Voice Within'). Get This

B00006879E|4.0|The first song I heard from Maroon 5 was &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and at first I thought it was Justin Timberlake, as did many of my friends when they listend to it. I was very turned off by it at first, but the rhythym and the beat were so catchy I had to hear more.  <br />I was definitely not disappointed with this CD!!  I find myself playing &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; so many times that my roommates have memorized the lyrics and they don't know who Maroon 5 is!  It's such a light but funky groove tune, backed up by Jamiroquai-esque piano and some of the slickest vocals I've heard in a long time.  <br />Of course every song is worth listening to, &quot;This Love&quot; I suggest checking out if you've never heard the band!<br />Only reason I couldn't go 5-stars is, well, at some points it does sound like Justin Timberlake, and that just don't fly in my musical collection ;)
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Yes, this is probably the worst Star Trek movie made, but I don't think it is as bad as its reputation. I think this story was filmed before its time. The special effectsof the time period weren't enough to pull off what they were called upon to do, the script should have been more polished so as to avoid some serious mischaracterizations (A sixty year old Uhura dancing nsked?), and the time just wasn't right for a spiritual quest to find God.<br />That said, it is still a film worth watching.  There are some humorous moments, particularly between Kelly and Nimoy. Yes, therer are obvious flaws and inconsistencies in the script, but that is what suspension of disbelief is all about.<br />It's a fun movie to watch, even though it could have been much more. I can see why some members of the cast have an axe to grind with Shatner after seeing these results. The Paramount powers That be have never let him nar a camera ago, you know.  I'd advise anyone to seek out the story about Harlan Ellison's pitch for this movie. That, my friends, would have been a classic.
B000006TRV|5.0|Transcending time and musical revision, Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; stands as an epoch work that makes one wonder if this type of music/message could be accomplished today. This classic epitomized the height of &quot;Art Rock&quot; and really changed music (and the band for that matter) forever.<br />Roger Water's ode to the slow descent into abhorrent pychosis has a uniqueness and novelty even today that grabs the listener and drags him along for a truly one-of-a -kind musical experinece. Pink Floyd's combination of tight musical discipline and the slightly off-key musings of Waters create a rock classic that serves as an alternative to this and any period's music. &quot;They just don't make music like this anymore...&quot; Songs such as &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Vera&quot;, &quot;Waiting For the Worms&quot; and &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; speak not only to past generations...they reach the introspective side of any thoughtful music listener past or present.<br />As with any &quot;concept&quot; album from the 70's (the Stones, Led Zeppelin, even Earth, Wind and Fire and the Ohio Players) this should be listened to in it's entirety many times to capture it's true artistic genius. These songs flow so easily one into another, they epitomize the late 70's &quot;monster&quot; album production techniques. This truely is the height of Pink Floyd's career and, by virtue of it's evident popularity, still presents a freshness and immediacy that makes other comtemporary works pale by comparison.<br />Sadly, this work marked the beginning of the end of this great combination. The 1982 issue &quot;The Final Cut&quot; was largely a continuation of the separation of Roger Waters from the group and even though some great music eminated from this breakup, rock music never has approached this type of soaring, intellectual musicality ever again. Strong lyrical voice along with exemplary musical backing, Pink Floyd enjoys aplace in contemporary music that few others have attained. This album epitomizes that standing and should be essential listening for all contemporary and future generations to really understand how to formulate monlithic concept albums. Highest recommendation.
B0000070UK|4.0|The second part of the groundbreaking Keeper Of  The Seven Keys part I! To be fair (without being influenced by the love and respect I have for this album) PartII wasn't as good as the first one, but nevertheless a record containing some of the best known power/speed metal songs ever written! The album continues with the same energy and structure of songs but with more ideas from guitarist Weikath and less of Kai Hansen and a slightly more commercial feel. All in all a wonderful conclusion to the first part.<br /><br />\\"Eagle Fly Free\\" is considered the best power metal song ever written, comprising of dual guitar solos,perfect vocals,a bass and drum solo. \\"Dr. Stein\\" is a wonderful, melodic, funny(lyrics) and classic song. \\"March Of Time\\" is a technical, also melodic and strong power tune. \\"I Want Out\\" is a catchy heavy metal song that fulfills its purpose. \\"We Got The Right\\" is a strong power-ballad were Michael Kiske shines, delivering a breathtaking performance filled with melodic and high-pitched vocals. Finally the title track has some magnificent ideas but it sadly can't surpass the masterpiece \\"Halloween\\" of part I (the chorus is a little cheesy).<br /><br />Musically the album is still characterized by fast double-bass drumming, twin-guitar melodic reefs and solos, outstanding vocals and fantasy lyrics-themes.<br />The production is slightly better than the first part, as the album sounds tighter and kind of clearer. The band sounds a bit tighter compared to their previous relish, but that maybe due to the better production.<br /><br />Michael Kiske has surely glued in the band and his charismatic voice gives you the chills throughout the whole album (he sings higher than ever, hitting all possible notes with great precision)!<br /><br />The only minor drawback in this album are the tracks \\"You Always Walk Alone\\" and \\"Rise and Fall\\" witch cannot by any means be considered bad songs, but just don't seem to fit here...And the other being that most of the songwriting was done by Weikath, who is a exceptional songwriter and guitarist but not as good as Hansen.<br /><br />This is a classic and groundbreaking record in the history shelves of metal, together with part I. A source of inspiration and influence to countless bands to follow.<br />This is also the last chapter in the Helloween (80's) glorious era, from where onwards the band went downhill (in my opinion).<br /><br />A MUST HAVE for any power/speed,heavy metal and open-minded hard rock fan.<br /><br />Be sure to check out \\"Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part I\\" and \\"I Want Out: Live\\".
B000002LQR|5.0|This is quite possibly the Chili Peppers' greatest album, even though I own every single album they made, even though I LOVE &quot;One Hot minute&quot; and &quot;the uplift mofo party plan&quot; I always go back to this album because it is their most creative and the songs flow into each other.  Even though it's not the most rocking album they made &quot;One Hot minute&quot; is more rock than this this is the band at their most creative.  &quot;otherside&quot; has been overplayed and I frankly don't like the song, but &quot;Under the bridge&quot; is the single that fans won't get tired of no matter what, it's just an amazing song, I reccomend this album, it's probably the best album of the 90s.
B000002BQK|5.0|I'm still trying to collect all of Mariah's albums. I got Daydream,Butterfly,Rainbow and Charmbracelet. <BR>This album is really the one that made me start really liking her music. The r&amp;b ish Hip hop tracks are great work by Mariah. Although i have to say that Charmbracelet beats her Rainbow and Butterfly Lp's. This is a great cd. <BR>Fave Songs:<BR>Honey<BR>Butterfly (The most beautiful video ever)<BR>My All<BR>The Roof<BR>Breakdown<BR>Whenever You Call (I also like the version with Brian McKnight)<BR>Outside
B000089RVX|1.0|This album is garbage. Don't waste your time or money on it!
0156027321|3.0|Well written, gripping yarn, but an awful lot of work for just one punchline.
B000174LVQ|5.0|I cannot believe how much fun this freakin album is to listen to! From start to finish it's just soooo much FUN! It's like a machine-gun flamenco massage for your worn-out mind. If you suffer from Recurring Boring Thought Syndrome (RBTS), the music within this album has the power to derail your train of thought and throw you on a lateral-thinking binge. Just when you think you know what note or musical sequence is comming next... YOU'RE SUPRISED EVERY TIME! The guitar, singing and clapping come together very nicely. Nobody FIGHTS for your attention, it's all about cooperation here; the integration is seamless. The singing is really pretty; it has of a refreshing and unusualy large amount of simultaneous voices (unusual for Flamenco anyway). This album will take you deep. The best way I can describe this album is \\"Fireworks and Caramels\\" ... You heard me.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|I've got this album on repeat.  Listen to it over and over. They have a definite signature sound that is all theirs. I have all their cds and it's a toss up between this one and \\"One\\" for the best. Gotta love this sound.  Keep em coming Dave. I don't listen to the radio so my music education comes from reading (weird).  I like Foos because Dave came from Nirvana. Granted, the music is commercial.  You won't hear gut wrenching, blood for tears, psychic trauma like you will on Nirvana.  But it's good, real good.
B00005T30L|4.0|For my money, a much better movie than the other recent underground comic book translation, &quot;American Splendor&quot;. It's about two female high school graduates who bravely confront impending adulthood in the mundane suburbs of California and it is funny without being loud and cynical without being abrasive. Probably a more precise deptction of the teen scene than the current slice of silly cinematic pie, it's a rewarding, funny thoughful film for all concerned.
B0000041Z6|4.0|Was Solti an exuberant, dramatic conductor in this Mahler set and elsewhere? Sure. But the maestro was more than capable of fine sensitivity in his music-making, too. Anyone who's listened to a lot of his work knows that the caricature of him as some soulless conductor obsessed with whipping music into a frenzy is hardly the case. <br />You'll hear both drama and sensitivity here, coupled with the predictably glorious playing of the Chicago Symphony. It's true that the early digital sound on some of these recordings will strike some ears as too brightly lit, but it's certainly crystal clear. It's true, too, that Solti often emphasizes the extremes in Mahler's music, particularly the aggression, but Mahler's music _is_ extreme: in emotional range and shifts, in orchestration, in dynamics, in length. This isn't Debussy or Delius. <br />Because Mahler's music is often so intense and complex and larger-than-life, few conductors ever seem to capture it all, but with this set, Solti does an admirable job capturing a lot of it with passion, precision, and high drama (even if quiet introspection is sometimes downplayed in the process). When taken as a whole, these interpretations aren't dramatically better or worse than others I've heard, but merely different. Mahler spoke of his symphonies being like worlds unto themselves. Solti makes a great guide into those unforgettable sound worlds.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie.  Somewhere I'd heard it compared favorably to one of my favorite movies..BEFORE SUNRISE.  Although I appreciated Murray and Scarlett Johansson, the filming and soundtrack, it was hard to feel empathetic for 2 rich people lost in their own emptiness.  <BR>  Where was the passion?  (Mental if not physical?)  It was more interesting as a travel piece featuring urban Japan rather than a romance.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I had always shied away from It's a Wonderful Life because I'd seen the famous closing image a thousand times before--it's sort of a cultural icon--and had wrongly assumed this film would be a cheesy, cheery bit of Yuletide schmaltz. I was way, way off the mark. This is actually a beautifully nuanced and often dark and bitter tale showing how one man deals with life when it keeps kicking him in the teeth. When happiness does come in this film, it's hard won, not something that Santa joyfully showers on everyone. Jimmy Stewart proves again here why he was one of America's greatest actors--what a subtle, intelligent, deeply moving performance!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|As an casual music listener with taste mostly in classic rock, I had to get this CD after reading the hilarious Newsweek article about the group (read: slapping modern rock in its souless face). I was pleseantly surprised how well rounded the album is. No, its not that terrible original, but it sure feels good, nor is it that generic. I'm told that there's influences of AC/DC, aerosmith, and a dash of Pink Floyd, and many others in here. And there is. But I like this better than any of those groups, so the TOTAL bashing of &quot;inoriginallity&quot; is unwarranted, in my opinion. Neither are the lyrics great, but they aren't nearly as bad as some make it out to be; I've heard much, much worse. Plus they have a few spots where they actually shine. <br />Overall, this is as good of buy as you can get. Its kind of sad that a &quot;retro&quot; band IS the fresh air nowadays. But I don't think of Jet as &quot;retro.&quot; They're just a group that knows REAL rock. Thanks guys.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Thank you, Mr. Reviewer, for telling me what the heck this movie was about - I couldn't figure it out. You know, usually a movie has some sort of a guide that takes you through a story. Usually it's some good guy or ordinary fellow that people identify with. Less often it might be a bad guy who you &quot;love to hate.&quot;  Where's Donnie's appeal? The main character was too strange that I didn't get him, and so unlikable that I didn't really care. Where's the appeal? I couldn't even understand why his love interest was so attached. It reminded me of those immature teenage years when you think you're something more than you really are.  The story was so disjointed I couldn't tell what was going on either. Sure, it's a time travel piece, but it was done poorly, not like Mmento.  The Butterfly Effect should be much better. This film appeals to teenagers who think there's some hidden commentary about society. There's not. The family situational element was blown out of the water by the time travel stuff.  I will credit the bunny horror pieces, they were scary. Teenage comedy? I don't know where that came from. I hope today's youth don't regard this film as representative of their generation like mine did for the Breakfast Club or Pretty in Pink. The bottom line is Donnie's out there in his thoughts, like most teenagers today, and it's only a matter of time before reality hits them in the head like the jet engine did Donnie. If Amazon would let me rate it with zero start I would. Don't waste your time.
B000002JOH|5.0|I get the feeling that anyone who was into metal actually at the time this came out looks at it as groundbreaking. For me it was going from guns, metallica and nirvana to a new world of the true rage and hostility i was really looking for.  I'd never heard an album that represented more raw anger and hostility.  There's nothing but pure power and hatred in Phil's voice and the lyric's are Phil's most inspired. That's why headbanger's ball's soundbites were from this album.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I brought this album by trading in some of my old stuff to get the money. So right away, i knew that it was worth the trade. This is the type of album that needs time to grow on you. At my first listen i was utterly jaw dropping at the sound of Petrucci's guitar riff. It was huge, heavy and a lot different then the usual sound from either SFAM or SDOIT. The first song is really the song that Metallica should have written for the new album. As the new DT album progresses you start to notice that these guys are following a trend. They sound so much more aggressive and i find this a little hard to swallow at first. How could a band that wrote &quot;Through your eyes&quot; (from SFAM) write a song like &quot;This dying soul&quot;? In the end, i enjoyed the hard sound from DT. It reminds me that not all old people are soft, easy going rockers. I think that some of their sound challenges bands like Korn and Pantera. Not vocal wise though, LaBrie has a voice similar to Iron Maiden. But the music of Dream Theater can get very heavy.  All in all, if your a DT fan then this album is for you. Let it grow on you. Don't diss it straight away. If this is your first album from DT, then buy it but also check out Scenes From A Memory (SFOM). Enjoy. You will love it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora, to me, is the best CD ever. It can't get any better. It has several different genres in the music, including rock, hip-hop, and rap. Chester and Mike's vocals sound great, Brad is awesome on the guitar, Rob is so good with the drums, no one can be any better, Mr. Hahn is phenominal on his turn-tables, and Phoenix plays great bass. This CD is a MUST HAVE for every LP fan. If you still don't have it, you need to have it, or else your world might just stop revolving around the sun. Once you start listening to track 1 you won't want the CD to end, this is a guarentee.
B000002W9P|5.0|I became a Helloween fan just this year and a big fan at that. I have all of Helloween's studio albums plus: Best The Rest And The Rare, I Want Out-Live, and High Live. This is the best album w/vocalist Michael Kiske because just about every freakin song stands out.<br />Stand-Outs: I'm Alive, A Little Time, Twilight Of The Gods, A Tale That Wasn't Right, Future World, Halloween
B0000E6I1J|5.0|I can only add to the positive reviews to this cd. Joe Brown is great as is Clapton, Petty, Ringo and Paul. Jeff Lynne's Inner Light version is a highlight. Paul's comment at the end on the DVD (that all the Paul bashers are bringing up) was simply relating a cute comment that Olivia Harrison had made about Dhani. It was appropriate and fun. Too bad that many of the <BR>&quot;fans&quot; continue to bash Paul. George told us to &quot;love one another,&quot; perhaps, we should have more respect for one of George's colleagues who George ultimately made peace with.<BR>Paul's performances were great, he shared the stage graciously with Clapton on Something and While My Guitar Gently Weeps. <br />The only negative to the Cd is the exclusion of Horse to Water.
B000003TA4|5.0|There are no words to describe this album. Its one of those albums where every song is good no mayyer what back ground of music you come from. This album changed rock n' roll forever. This is the greatest album a of all time. Everyone knows this album, everyone has this album, and everyone loves it. It is the greatest masterpiece that words connot describe. It sold 12 million copies. Its not much but its influence is infinite. R.I.P Kurt Cobain
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave has a winning self-titled CD.  I love the entire album and think the stand out songs are &quot;Like A Stone,&quot; &quot;Shadow On The Sun,&quot; and &quot;I Am The Highway.&quot;  The lyrics for every song were very deep and excellently written.  I look forward to their future albums!  This is a must have CD!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's current album of &quot;In the zone&quot; is the best compilation of songs she has ever released. It has a variety of different styles of music that everybody would enjoy. It is definitely different from the music she had in the past and everybody should give this album a chance. I am sure that you'll like it.
B000089RVX|2.0|bad teenage angst lyrics mixed with generic music do not make a good album. the overplayed &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; i've never found to be even worth a listen, and the other tracks are no better. technically this could be considered linkin park-y metal which fits into &quot;bad nu-metal&quot;, so if you want good nu-metal that is still lighter than heavy metal, look at bands such as Snot, Slipknot, or even Korn, who do this sort of thing with much more style. on the other hand, if you want real &quot;emotional&quot; music, look at bands such as Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, or Mum.
0440180295|5.0|I wish I could tell you what a masterpiece this book is. I would tell you of Vonnegut's simple, but masterful use of language and the book's utterly honest humanity and screaming rage against mass death and destruction will leave any reader who undertakes this book profoundly moved and perhaps even changed.    There are other reviews here that state it far more eloquently than I have. All I can say is that if you have not read this book, I strongly urge you to do so right away. If you have read it, well then you know how brilliant it already is. This immortal work will make Vonnegut's name forever large in the pantheon of great writers.
0156027321|4.0|In his newest novel Life of Pi, Yann Martel weaves an exciting and passionate tale that<BR>transcends reality. Martel's simple yet meaningful diction allows the reader to ride along<BR>with young Pi as he faces danger, despair, and life-changing adventure. Pi's is a journey of<BR>love, family, self discovery, and survival. However, most importantly, it is a journey of<BR>faith: faith in God, faith in others, and faith in oneself. <BR> When young Pi's family is tragically killed in a shipwreck, he finds himself thrown<BR>overboard onto a lifeboat. Pi is anything but alone, as he is stranded with a hyena, an<BR>orangutan, a wounded zebra, and an enormous Bengal tiger from his father's zoo. As the<BR>animals discover one another, each wrestles for control in a hierarchy that is to be<BR>ultimately led by the Bengal tiger. As if surviving a shipwreck at sea with rapidly depleting<BR>rations is not enough, Pi is now required to share a boat with a 450-pound tiger. &quot;I was<BR>alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging onto an oar, an adult tiger in<BR>front of me, sharks beneath me, a storm raging about me,&quot; explains Pi as he is preparing<BR>for the worst. <BR> Writing such critically acclaimed books as Self, a novel, and The Facts Behind the<BR>Helsinki Roccamatios, a collection of short stories, Martel is no stranger to success. His<BR>fresh and imaginative writing style has charmed readers for years. Life of Pi only adds to<BR>the achievement of Martel's writing career that is sure to be long and flourishing.<BR> Martel's novel is structured in three parts, including notes from the author and an<BR>interview held shortly after Pi's rescue. The interview and author's note help add to the<BR>realism of the book, and sometimes make it hard to distinguish it between fiction and<BR>nonfiction. I found myself so connected to the characters and plot that the addition of<BR>outrageous events, such as carnivorous islands, did not phase me in the least. Isimply<BR>wanted to believe Pi's story, no matter what. At the end of the novel, the reader does not<BR>want to believe that it was a fictional tale because the characters and events are so<BR>realistic, so human. Martel should be commended on his ability to bring such realism to a<BR>world that has been magically invented. <BR> Pi's childlike innocence immediately draws the reader into the novel, and is a<BR>source of much comic relief. As a young boy, Pi is so excited by the idea of faith and<BR>religion that he chooses to practice not only one religion, but three. Pi resembles the child<BR>in all of us when he is confronted by his three spiritual leaders, all of whom are angry that<BR>he has not been loyal to any of them. In a moment of childlike wisdom, Pi simply looks up<BR>and says, \\"I just want to love God.\\" It is in Pi's innocence that truth can be found. He is a<BR>character full of enthusiasm and love for the world. He is wise beyond his years, and tells<BR>his tale with the hope of reaching out to the doubters of the world. Martel writes in the<BR>voice of Pi using language that is easily understood, yet always contains a deeper meaning.<BR>There is much more to Martel's novel than the survival of a young boy and a tiger. It is a<BR>coming of age story; a story of self discovery and determination. <BR> Although most of the novel was extremely realistic, There were moments in the<BR>novel that I found myself jolted out of my blind trust of Pi's storytelling. I began to<BR>wonder if he was telling the complete truth, or elaborating on his story a bit. However,<BR>Martel's expert writing always seemed to catch me right before I had lost faith, and was<BR>able to renew my trust in the narrator. Martel seems to enjoy pushing the envelope and<BR>seeing how far he can go before the reader will write him off as just another fantasy writer.<BR>He does this well, but will perhaps lose a few readers due to this technique.<BR> Pi's story is not exclusively excitement and adventure. It is also full of death,<BR>despair, and failure. There are moments of severe depression, and at one point, Pi resigns<BR>himself to death. The novel is a rollercoaster ride, where each high point is coupled with a<BR>low. However, Pi would not be the same person without undergoing such amazing and<BR>traumatic events. This is very evident in Martel's writing, and causes the reader to be<BR>tossed along the sea on the same soul-searching journey Pi endures. Even though Pi's<BR>journey is dismal at times, the reader is reminded of the author's statement that \\"This story<BR>has a happy ending.\\" It does, indeed. <BR> Pi ultimately experiences the rewards of self determination and never loses the faith<BR>he has come to prize. Martel's seamless storytelling makes one believe in the impossible,<BR>trust the inconceivable, and root for the success of both the Indian boy and his dangerous<BR>tiger. There is never a question of truth, because Martel's words hold a captivating<BR>honesty that is admirable among authors. His connection to human emotion is genuine,<BR>and though the book may not make the reader believe in God, it will prompt the reader to<BR>believe in something. As Pi explains at the beginning of the novel, \\"Doubt is useful for a<BR>while... but we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing<BR>immobility as a means of transportation.\\" To those who have lost faith or are just looking<BR>for an inspirational journey of survival, Life of Pi is sure to fit the bill.

B000002NBY|5.0|Paul Simon had been an international pop icon since the 1960's when he produced this fantastic dance jamboree, together with Zulu band Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Black township groove band Stimela (Ray Phiri). This successfully merges the beat and soul of the USA with that of South Africa.<br />The Boy In The Bubble opens the album. It seems to be a commentary on any war torn or strife torn society attempting to provide hope and comfort to people in dark and turbulent times.

B00005N9CV|5.0|True jazz lovers argue that Krall only has reached such a high popularity, as she indeed has, thanks to a shrewd marketing. That argument could be used just as effectively on singers like Norah Jones. As for Krall, she has a soft and sexy voice that appeals to many mainstream listeners who aren't concerned so much about jazz and how she plays the piano.<br />The marketing people behind Diana Krall's music is of course tempted to polish and popularize the music as much as possible. As is seen at once when looking on the cover of _The Look Of Love_, this is what they have done. The album begins with S'Wonderful played with bossa nova rhytms and a laid back vocal. The whole album is actually very much inspired by bossa nova, which provides a romantic atmosphere - again suiting Krall's looks and voice and the many listeners.<br />On Krall's first albums, _Stepping Out_, _Only Trust Your Heart_, and _All For You_, the romantic atmosphere is somewhat missing. The marketing wasn't so much aware of her commercial oppertunities that they regulated her own sound. The albums as a result sound more raw, resulting in more piano from Krall and more jazz-like compositions and atmosphere. What i miss, though, when hearing her earlier work, is exactly what _The Look Of Love_ has to offer: the richness of the sound, the polished sound quality, the not so jazz-like songs etc. The intro on I Get Along Without You Very Well for instance, is beautiful and heartbreaking. So is all other songs on the album. I understand people's objections to Krall's music, but at the same time I feel that the music is gripping, moving, meaningful and whatever words there is to express good music.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|I'm sorry to be so honest and blunt, but this girl has no business being in the music industry. She cannot write or arrange music or compose worthwhile lyrics (when you use your own name as a lyric, let that be a clue). She is a complete fabrication of her label and the greedy industry machine. She can play the piano and is pretty but the honeymoon ends there. The lead single &quot;you don't know my name&quot; sounds great because it is a blatant rip-off of the classic soul and R&amp;B of the early 1970s. Think Marvin Gaye, Harold Melvin, Billy Paul and groups like the Moments. She probably has a entire crew of writers schooled on this classic stuff looking to recycle the old sound with her hip-hop edge. This is one of the most unoriginal artists i've ever heard in my entire life. She has nothing to say, no musical ideas to speak of, just sit and play the music the producers create, sing and pretend she's the female stevie wonder. Nevermind about buying it, if you even THINK this is worthwhile then you are clueless. <br />Do yourself a favor seek out some early '70s R&amp;B/Soul like the artists mentioned above and don't hand over your hard earned money to the greedy folks at J records.
B0000DG00B|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of the original Allman Brothers band. This 2 disc set however is spotty at best with occassional flashes of brillance. I completely agree with the reviewer who said that alot of the guitar playing on this is out of tune and almost unlistenable. This is very evident in the second disc. I get the sense that it is mostly Dickey that is out of tune but that does not absolve Duane of this problem. The underrated highlights of this whole set has to be Gregg's singing which is in fine form and often overlooked for the guitar playing. The only redeeming jam on the second disc is the Mountain jam which is outstanding. I swear there seems to be telepathy involved when it comes to the guitar players and between Berry's excellent bass solo and the drummers. That being said the Whipping Post, Reed, and Stormy Monday are big disappointments. Listen to the broken musical ideas of Duane during Whipping Post and you realize this ain't no Fillmore East. Dickey and Duane always used to impress me with there melodic sense of phrasing. None of it is present in the big jam tunes of the Second Disc. Its very sad in fact. There is also alot of spotty and out of tune playing on the first disc as well but it carries much more highlights. The Dreams is brillant and Duanes soloing is outstanding. Here his melodic brilliance shines. The Hoochie Coochie, Every Hungry Woman and Statesboro are powerhouses of energy. Why they decided to put a broken Mountain Jam on is beyond me. They could have put out the first Disc with the Mountain Jam from the Second Disc and it would have cut out all the unneccesary garbage and inferior versions of Don't Keep Me Wondering and Statesboro that reside on the second disc. One will notice that the Allmans played much more in tune in '71. I don't know why that was.
B00013PHGS|4.0|first off  i could have burned the cd 2months before it hit the stores !!! but im glad i didnt well worth waiting plus i like the dvd after you listen to this album  everything else sounds to normal and boring more of a lay back album nothing u could play at a party not in this world at least ! the lyrics get kinda sloppy but they are french it must not be so easy for them but it doesnt matter cuz this album is so complex its not even music its art stand out tracks for me would have to be ALL  of them but the ones i listen to the most would have to be '' VENUS  RUN ANOTHER DAY great songs HZ LEGEND was a great album as well but  hz had  songs i just couldnt get into  songs that i skip  but not walkie talkie all there  songs  are very masterd very complex the only other band that i could love as much as air would have to be broadcast another gem alot of people dont know of  pick up a copy of talkie walkie its a must have ..
B00005JM20|1.0|I loved Black Adder for the wit and Mr. Bean for the innocence. So what we have here is a film where we mix the BAD points of both characters (Blackadder's willingness to lie, cheat and otherwise be a complete bounder; and Mr. Bean's utter stupidity) for laughs. No laughs erupt, however, and soon this film begins to feel like an embarressing exercise in making a quick buck. First &quot;Mr. Bean - The Movie&quot; (which died an ignominious film death) and now this! Rowan, dear heart, stick with television.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I'm not a musician, so I have no idea if these guys have 'talent'.  The lyrics may not be great, either; and the music itself may be completely derivational and unoriginal.  But really, who gives a f---?  It sounds awesome, it rocks, it's fun.  And if they sound so much like _insert great 60s band here_, isn't that a compliment?  Aren't you basically calling the music kick-a--, saying that if it were recorded 35 years ago it'd now be on a greatest hits compilation like Hot Rocks?  As Picasso said, good artists copy but great artists steal.  And if it's overrated, well...?  So what?  Does that mean you can no longer enjoy it?  If it's good, it's good, and if it's bad, it's bad.<br />So get over yourselves, purists.  Jack White could be the biggest poseur in the world, but if poseurs rock like this, then tell me where to find more.
0446677450|4.0|First, I wanted to write this review because I am continually surprised by how many people claim Kiysaki says X is no good and everyone should run out and buy real estate and start business's etc.  He gives very sound advice in this book and is meant more to build financial literacy about how to build a solid future by first building up income generating assets and then buying liabilities later when they can be supported by assets.  He does not say it is bad to work a job, but simply that you are better off not relying on a job as your only income over long term.<br />  He very clearly states that Bonds, mutual funds and &quot;anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready market&quot; is an asset that you should work to aquire.  Yet, I have seen people argue how wrong he is to suggest people not buy mutual funds or bonds.  He also tells people to not start their own business unless they are really serious about it because their odds of failure are so high etc.  This is NOT a get rich quick guide or a my way is the only way type of book. <br />For me it was an eye openner that changed the way I view my money, and how I spend vs. invest for the future.  This book is not set on any one way of doing anything and that is why it is lean on specific advice.  My only real criticism is that at times he seems to drag a point out in order to keep you hooked to buy his other books.
B00005JLYW|1.0|No this is not the matrix. Why does every film now think they can have these slow motion super-human fight scenes when there are no mutants or monsters just charlie's angels(they never flew in the 70's). I have a real big problem with this film. Mainly because it panders to the brainless masses that will watch and love anything that has enough commercials backing it up. Thats the problem they spent the whole buddget on ads and crapy over-priced actresses and forgot to include a plot that does'nt rely on something blowing up every two minutes. Bottom-line I could'nt watch for more than twenty minutes it could very well be one of the worst films ever made.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It has been a long time that I've seen a movie that can be interpreted on so many different levels, and it is enjoyable at all of them.  Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are outstanding.<br />At the surface level it is a story of two people stuck in downtown Tokyo who meet and find they are attracted to each other, but know their friendship can only be platonic and brief.  The scenes of the city and the clash of cultures are both funny and poignant.  On the next level it is a movie about what's real and not real.  Be sure to keep track of images in mirrors, windows, photos, and TV screens.  At another level, it is about the barriers that are errected around us - physical, cultural, emotional, and self-inflicted that keep us separated.<br />In the end, however, you know these two people are better for having encountered one another.  <br />If you're looking for an action movie with its share of sex and violence, this isn't it, but if your looking for great entertainment that also leaves you thinking, this is the one you want.
0345451325|5.0|Halo-the popular X-box video game- has recently had its second novel published based on the in game play and story. While Halo: The Flood by William C. Dietz contents much of the action and setting of the game, its predecessor-Halo: The Fall Of Reach by Eric Nylund- focuses more on the origins of the enigmatic Master chief and the ethical questions of future soldier hood.<br />The story of Reach is about John, AKA the SPARTAN master chief, his \\"selection\\" to be a guardian of the empire, the training he endures and his fight to save humanity. One of 75 SPARTAN II, children chosen by the government at the age of 6 to be super soldiers, he is neither the strongest nor the fastest; however, John is the bravest. His foe, the Covenant, is a group of aliens waging a jihad against humanity for an as yet unknown reason. They have superior technology and are only kept away from Earth by the Cole Protocol: any ship engaged with the Covenant must destroy all data and navigation concerning earth. And though the SPARTANS, protected with MJOLNIR armor (the name of Thor's hammer, which as long as the gods possessed would protect Asgard and Valhalla), never lose a battle, they are slowly giving way to the alien onslaught. The action cumulates to the climatic battle of Reach a galactic Thermopylae were all the SPARTANS, except Master Chief, fall in defense of the planet.<br /><br />While the first book was a better novel its action was far less than Flood. The book starts where the game does with the Pillar of Autumn crashing onto Halo and ends with the master chief escaping, once again alone (it does not pay to be friends with a Spartan). The appeal of Flood was the introduction of game favorites 343 Guilty spark-a senile robot with the keys to a doomsday device straight from Dr. Strangelove-  and the flood- a parasitic life form that's sole purpose is to fill its end less hunger. Fans will be pleased by the seamless flow that matches the game; however, there are no great literary aspects, nor any of those troubling ethical questions that plagued our hero in Reach.<br />More than just action the story offers a glimpse into the not so distant future of warfare and the ethical questions that need answering. Dr. Halsey, the founder of the SPARTAN II project, is unsure if the creation of an army that may be earth's only hope justifies the kidnapping of 6-year-old children, sending them to a life of military brutality and injecting them with drugs and implants that give them inhuman strength, but kill half the SPARTANS from side effects. And in the story we see not the thriving world of tomorrow, the Earth itself is only referred to in regards to the Cole protocol, but a harsh militant empire in a perpetual war with an enemy that they do not even know why wants to destroy them.<br /><br />The story has a good mix of battles that range from space, jungle and zero gravity and are well described. The characters, though far from revolutionary, do change with the story as does the technology. One can tell the book was written by a civilian by the SPARTANS referring to each other by their first names. Mr. Nylund does a nice job of putting in enough Physics for Trekkers who actually care about the dynamics of slipstream, and knowing when to jump back to a battle scene. The Halo future is interesting precisely because of it's so close to our world: DNA modification, AI computers that are alive and battle armor that grants near superhuman abilities and all the while still containing shields, aliens and super weapons that dwarf the Deathstar and.<br /><br />I enjoyed the two novels and finished them in a few hours.

0385504209|4.0|Having just finished this book on tape, I have to say I enjoyed the story, its fast pace, and the unsuspecting turns the story frequently took.  I wanted the story to be longer and entertain me further.  The story centers around two people, experts in their respective fields, and their quest for the &quot;truth&quot; about the Holy Grail.  I rate this book near the top of the list of adventure/thriller books I have read.  Having said what I enjoyed about the story, now let me say that this &quot;version&quot; is but one of many theories about the early history of Christianity.  What is written in the book is well written Fiction, not fact!  The theories and conspiracies about the Priory of Sion, the Knights Templar, and the Holy Grail will continue to be just that because what is proven is history and all else is fiction, fable, or vivid imagination.  The other thing that detracted from my enjoying the story as a mystery was that I saw several of the surprises well before their being revealed to the reader/listener.  They were just too obvious with the revealing of the teacher being the most expected thing in the book.  I realize that the subject of this book is one that enflames proponents of both sides of the history of Christianity, as is shone in the number of reviews and the votes on the reviews.  I hope my objective approach is understood by all.
0553212478|5.0|Yeah, I don't have to say anything about this book because it has already been said.  But I will say that I love it.  So much so that I had an entire dream in Shelley's prose.  All of the characters were speaking so eloquently that I knew it had to be a dream.  Oh, Frankenstein is not the monster, he is the creator.  The monster is not an oaf either.  He picked up an entire language in a year or something.  Sharp dude...or dudes.  Another recommendation.<br />Hoo-ah!
B00005A46T|5.0|As far as I've read on this review, there have been a ton of people who trash Slipknot simply because they don't emulate bands like Venom or Megadeth. This, in my opinion, is a very poor way of rating music in terms of enjoyment.<BR>Being a fan of bands like Slipknot, KoRn, Staind, and P.O.D., I happened to enjoy this CD very much. Slipknot brings to its music on this CD what it has always brought to its fans, and ups the ante about fifty times.<BR>This CD is worth buying, by far. Be sure to make copies for your friends.
B00006JU7T|5.0|I must first start of with saying that this is almost to much man fightin' for my own damn self.  I had to hit pause a couple of times during the movie to truly appreciate the goodness.  I have only recently come to the conclusion that Pacino is ^&amp;%*&amp;^% UNBELIEVABLE!!  This guy is not only just a raw talent, but he could pick them also.  People always talk about the DeNiro Scorcesse connection, but Pacino Lumet relationship is unstoppable.  The gritty realness that is felt on the dirty pavement of New York is a welcome change to the bloated stuff that I have seen recently at the movie theaters.  Not only do I like the acting in this movie, but I also like the story.  The two go hand in hand to produce a classic that I should have seen a while ago.  Plus you have to check out the outfits, too funky for myself!  Strongly Recommended<br />Hoo-ah
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|What can you say about Thirteenth Step? Wow! This album is amazing! I would buy this album just to listen to Noose. Not many albums out any more when you can listen to the entire thing over and over and just appreciate it more.  This album acctually deserves 5 stars. The lyrics (as always) are simply a thing of beauty. Not much music is brought together as well as this entire album.

B00000JCOV|1.0|Let's start off by saying I don't hate Slipknot, per say. They're no-good hacks, but that's not hate-worthy. This is the what happens when you listen to Straight Outta' Compton, Reign in Blood, and Filth Pig far too much, can't play your instruments, have an infantile grasp on concepts like music or art, and decide to start a band. Only the intro, &quot;742617000027&quot;, is listenable, in a sort of &quot;Skinny Puppy with a hangover and no talent&quot;-kinda way. But my real gripe is really not with Slipknot, but the fans that they infect with their defication for the ears. Some kid reviewed this album on Amazon(you'll see it above) claiming it was &quot;...powerful HARD music that only people of hardcore music will like.&quot; Thats funny. I thought Minor Threat and Agnostic Front were hardcore...oops...my mistake. Thanks for the correction, stupid-metal kid. He goes on to say &quot;Most people give SlipKnoT a bad review because they dont like SlipKnoTs scary image and/or heavy metal music.&quot; Shocking news, as you can imagine, as I'm listening to &quot;Crush My Soul&quot; by Godflesh right now(one of the heaviest bands out there) , but I also dislike Slipnot. I'm a huge Puppy fan too, and they've got the most disturbing image you could ask for, yet I still can't stand the 'knot. A conundrum, for sure. Thanks again, stupid-metal kid. See, this is the kinda crap I can't stand. The fans are about 100 times more irritating than the actual music, but make no mistake: this is a second rate stab at pseudo-industrial metal(by the way, do u really need a guy in your band who does nothing but runs the sampler? jesus christ...)with sub par rap/scream vocals. Avoid at all costs. If you want dark, heavy music, pick up some Godflesh or Ministry. You'll be thanking yourself later.

B00005JL78|4.0|The idea that murderers could be stopped and convicted before they even commit the act probably sounds very reassuring and even beneficial to many people.  After all, countless lives will be saved and people's lives won't be shattered by the pointless killings that occur every day in this country.  There is one small flaw though; someone may be planning murder, but at the last minute will call off the attack.  That does not make them right, but it doesn't make them wrong either.  Also, no proof exists except the thoughts of the person themself, thereby sending the old adage of innocent until proven guilty to heck.<BR>Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, the chief of police in the new Pre-Crime Unit.  Through the help of three &quot;Pre-Cogs&quot; who can see murders before they happen, Anderton and his team apprehend the murderer before the act takes place.  Currently, the system only exists in Washington, D.C. but there will soon be a vote to take it national.  About a week before the vote is to take place, a young agent from the Justice Department, played by Colin Farrel, arrives to investigate the Pre-Crime Unit to make sure that there can never be any mistakes.  Anderton believes that he is after his job, especially when the Pre-Cogs predict that, within 72 hours, Anderton will kill a man that he has never even heard of.  Now, Anderton is on the run from his old friends, and he has do to everything that he can to stay away from the authorities.<BR>Pretty much every aspect of this film is good.  The story is phenominal, the stunts and effects are amazing, and the acting is great.  I think that the only problem is that it starts to drag on a bit toward the end, but the unexpected ending is definitely worth the wait.  This movie will make you think while simultaneously visually pleasing you.

B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in translation is a very different and refreshing piece of work, when compared with all the other mainstream movies around at the moment.<br />Bill Murray as the middle age crisis star Bob Harris had given up a career building play to star in an ad in which he has no idea what he was supposed to do. Even worse, his stay in the jetlagged Tokyo was lengthened out of business consideration and now he had to face  more lonely sleepless nights.<br />Similarly a university graduate wife of a photographer on business trip in Tokyo was having the same problem. She was having the \\"expatriate wife syndrome\\" that apart from insomnia, she felt lonely and helpless. She attempted to cure this infinite loneliness by going around the city to look for interesting stuff to do. However, to her surprise, what interested her was another lonely man in the bar of the same hotel.<br />Their encounter sparked off a very interesting relationship and friendship between the pair. They do stuff together, trying new healthy Jap food of which some required them to cook by themselves (a shock for them). The cultural shock was blended into the support that they have for each other in this alien city that they don't want to be in.<br />Lost in Tranlsation deals with the topic of unwillingness, cultural shock and mutual support. Who would foresee a Yale graduate wife of a photographer will develop an interesting friendship with a megastar in his mid-age crisis? The topic was dealt with with delicate care and tenderness mixed with a slim sense of saddness. The director managed to balance all these aspects tactfully. From how she tried to show the audience with how Tokyo life looks like in the 2 hours, we can see that it was well researched as the movie didn't show stereotypical Japanese culture only. The movie gave the Japanese culture a very fair portrayal which is very well done for an American movie.<br />The actors are brilliant. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson gave an excellent performance for the two characters. Bill as an experienced actor in and alien culture doing things he had been doing all his life, but still had no idea how to do it was just fabulous. Scarlett Johansson as a wife longing for care and love in an alien city was also very well done. Her struggle against loneliness by site seeing and hanging out with this mid-age actor was well crafted.<br />The movie portrayed some of the beautiful sceneries from Tokyo and Kyoto and the cinematography is very well done. It is not a typical mainstream movie type of story that you would expect but it does give you a feeling of difference. The gags are very well done and keep the movie interesting. Nonetheless, there are certain parts of the movie that pace slowed down immensely, this could lose a bit of audience attention. No matter what, Lost in Translation is still a movie of choice if you are looking for a movie with a touch of freshness.ce for the two characters.

0345333853|5.0|I was not really &quot;sold&quot; on the book at first.  But the more I read, the more I fell in love with the story and characters.  I love the fact that the book is written with great compassion from a womans point of view.  The characters make mistakes, yet survive and learn from them.  By the time I finished this book, I had to get the next book in the series.  That led to the next book and the next...  These books are &quot;keepers&quot;. I want to keep them on my shelves and re-read them.  I even had to buy the DVD movie of the Mists of Avalon.  I am now a completely avid fan of the series.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This movie was not bad; the flying sequences were good, the love scene was good and the attack itself was portrayed excellently, but the only problem lies in a whole lot of little things that were either wrong or unecassary.  Such as the Doolittle raid scene.....what was the point of it!!!!!!!!.....and in history there was no pilot from pearl harbour who participated in the doolittle raid, and there was not a pilot who fought for the british and fought at pearl harbor..........................3/5
B0000CGV00|5.0|I believe<br />...this is an interesting recording that deserves to be heard both for its unusual coupling as well as for the performances given here. Let's start from the beginning:<br />The Corigliano piece does have some moments of beauty, and mainly so from where the theme from Beethoven 7th - 2 occur and to the end. As a whole the piece seems plain and simple, although some colorations and harmonies are interesting. However the transition into the Beethoven sonata is remarkable and very elegant indeed. All of a sudden you may be a bit into the Tempest sonata without really noticing it! At least I was.<br />With the Tempest we move into home territories for Grimaud. The expressiveness from Grimaud that we have come to know suits Beethoven perfect and brings a freshness I find irresistible. She plays loud, whisperingly quite and also very much in between. Her unusual spread chord playing and her search for freedom of timing make up for the most involving Beethoven sonata I've heard in years. Things progress from strong to marvellous here. The second movement is so fresh but also very beautifully played. It is matched by a third movement that I lack words to describe. If you know her readings of some Beethoven sonatas on Teldec you have an idea of what to expect - but this is even better. This needs to be heard.<br />With the reading of the Choral Fantasy it is game, set and match for Grimaud. And for Salonen, SRSO and most of all for the choral singing at the end. The joyous energy that is put into this has no equal in other recordings of this piece that I know. The orchestral sound is dense and rhythmically strong. There is a wonderful forward momentum despite its rhapsodic character. There is beautiful playing from Grimaud in the middle of the piece that is especially good. Some parts of the interplay between Grimaud and the orchestra are slightly manipulated but still work very well. Surprisingly few if any wrong notes in a live recording where there are nohints of an audience at all. Strongly recommended!<br />The Pärt piece is new to me. It starts off with great choral singing and after a while leads into some structured chaos. After that we hear some typical Pärt sounds and of course there is this Bach prelude. It all makes up for good listening. I happen to have the French version of this CD and it has this Bach prelude as a bonus. It is romantically played and when the Credo moves into the Bach prelude it is inspired from, I hear the most moving part on this CD. Unfortunately this Bach-bonus is not included in some other incarnations of this CD.<br />All in all, I believe (!) the Beethoven pieces are reasons good enough for a recommendation. The choral singing at the end of the Choral Fantasy is reason enough for me! Find a place and timing to test your equipment and play it loud! You may also find new pieces to enjoy here and most of all discover what a great work the Choral Fantasy is.<br />A word of warning. Grimaud playing is very characteristic and what I find very fresh can also be mannered in the ears of others. Frequent use of rubatos and thick chord playing makes for a challenging listening that will irritate some. Melodic lines are stretched and then hurried. Straight lines and simplicity is not a Grimaud approach.
B00008EYA5|3.0|I was kind of disappointed with SWAT but not to disappointed. I mean the movie didn't really get started until the end. Some movies can pull this off with leaving the audience wanting more, but unfortunately SWAT wasn't one of them. Jackson did a really good job in the movie and so did all the actors but where there's no plot there's no movie.

Can't believe the ignorance of some of the reviewers but then again it's not for everyone! Whatever you do, DON'T OVERLOOK THIS because it could change your life so check it out just to be sure... I can tell you that once you are sucked in, well then YOU ARE IN!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|Finally a vampire movie with an intriguing story to tell. I originally saw UW at the thearter, and let me say it was a whole lot better than what I had initially expected. The idea of vamps fighting werewolves was a fresh and especially interesting concept. Some people have complained about how dark the movie is. I believe that the darkness adds to the believability of the story. This is definitely not a gore fest or a martial arts type of movie. Am I the only one who's really tired of seeing vampires that are martial arts master? This movie leaves a lot to the imagination when it comes to the gore factor but not to much. This is definitely a good one to own, and I can't wait until the sequel comes out.
0060555661|5.0|Years ago I read David Chilton's \\"The Wealthy Barber\\" and was instantly hooked by its accessibility and plain common sense regarding investing and financial planning.  If the \\"The Wealthy Barber\\" was grade school, \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" is college.  Not nearly as accessible, but so much more fulfilling and useful in everyday terms.  This most recent edition ups the ante even further by including commentary from financial writer Jason Zweig, updating Graham's classic text with examples from the boom and bust of 1996-2001.  Graham explains the principles of value investing clearly and with passion for his subject.  As Santayana wrote, \\"Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it.\\"  Graham knows his history, and provides this guidebook for how to spare yourself that doom.  I enjoyed every minute of it, and learn something from it every time I pick it up.
B000001FKY|5.0|Hysteria is easily Def Leppard's defining album and it's obvious why that is.  The album consists of no less than seven hit singles: Women, Rocket, Animal, Love Bites, Pour some sugar on me, Armageddon It, &amp; Hysteria (the first 6 playing in order!) and the albums 5 other tracks are no slouches either (not a weak moment on the album).  Another important point of Hysteria is that it followed Def Leppard's other masterpiece &quot;Pyromania&quot; by four years.  The gap was due to drummer Rick Allen being in an automobile accident that cost him an arm.  An electronic drum kit was developed especially for Allen and he turned in a performance equal too if not better than on &quot;Pyromania&quot;.  Being a drummer I can't help but have admiration for Rick Allen, if for no other reason than having dedication &amp; drive to return to what he does and sounding amazing.  The entire band (Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, Steve Clark, Rick Savage, and Rick Allen) turn out equally amazing perfomances here making this album a veritable classic.  Def Leppard had a sound all of their own in a time when many bands were unoriginal.  That sound is no better captured than on Hysteria.  A must own.
B0000DCGT0|3.0|Having already read the book I was really looking forward to watching the movie.  I was disappointed at how much different the movie was from the book.  I was glad I read the book because I was sure that the movie would have caused a lot of confusion especially in the beginning while it was trying to introduce all the characters at once.  I felt that it left a lot of important details out.  I still enjoyed watching the book come to life.  I just wish it would have included more of the detailed races which made the book so exciting for me.
B000002J1U|5.0|This has got to be the best Rock album ever. I liked this album a lot when it first came out, and I still like it. Maybe it reminds me of when I was a teenager, I don't know, but this album has gotten more playing time on my stereo than any other Album I own period. After my Original copy wore out I bought a Japanese vinyl pressing, which I still have and its sounds just as good if not better that the CD. I think this was the first CD I ever bought, I have recently replaced that with an updated CD version that has better quality... I no longer listen to most of my rock albums, I'm into Jazz and Alternative now, but I still find time to listen to songs on this album (CD now) and include them in my recordings and things I like to listen to...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow.  I just finished watching the entire season in less that a week, and I was blown away.  I am a huge Buffy/Angel fan that somehow didn't really know this show even existed until it was already cancelled.  It is really sad that something this good was cancelled after only a handful of episodes.  I would recommend this show to anyone, and if you're on here thinking about picking it up, I would highly recommend it.  You won't be sorry.
B000002KDM|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all times.  One of the best albums that JT ever made.  It's strong.  He speaks from the soul.  I've listened to it so many times I have it completely memorized.  I tend to like his older music much better than his newer tunes.  I can't recommend this album strongly enough.  Enjoy.
B00005JMCT|2.0|This film really is pushing it. In my opinion it shouldn't have been made - it does nothing to progress and mature the series, in fact, most of the characters have managed to regress from the previous movie - they don't seem to have done anything at all in the 3 years after the 2nd film and the dissaperance of the half of the cast that didn't return is totally unexplained. Theres no mention of Oz in the film at all, even though he was supposed to be their good friend. There just doesn't seem to have been any development in the characters since the last film, is the point I'm trying to make. <br />It falls far short of matching the comedy of the other two films. The gags came out as unbelievable and simply just forced in an attempt to make the 3rd instalment even more 'gross out' than the previous two. Thats not to say that most of the gags aren't funny, because they are, its just that they come across as very tiresome , which is why they fall short of being hilarious - you just feel like you've seen it before. I have no idea how the hell so many people can say that this film is better than the first two. The charm seems to have gone, the humour seems to have just been rehashed from the first two films and some of the characters just seem there out of obligation, Kevin and Jims Dad for example, I don't think Eugene Levey got even one funny line in this film.(He might have actually, I'm only posting this review after the first time I've watched it, a few hours ago / but the point is, that Eugene's talents just seem to have been wasted here).<br />Overall it comes off very tired and awkward, it left me a little dissapointed. By no means is it an awful film, it just strikes me as a bit of a letdown considering how good the other two films were. I won't bother putting any of the positive parts of the film here, partly because I can't be bothered to type anymore, but also because - it all seems to have been said before in all of these rave 5 star reviews posted by peoplewho've seemingly watched a completely different version of this film to me. But I'll award it 3 stars anyways, its still funny and Stifler definately suceeds in stealing the film by being 'totally insane'(or mentally ill, whichever way you'd prefer to see it) as stated by Seann on the extras of the dvd. But by no means is this a classic teen-comedy - its just such a shame that this franchise has to be exploited so much.
B00006CXSS|4.0|If you are a WWII fan you should get this DVD. Many improved special effects and more historically accurate uniforms of both sides. What Easy Company did in Bastogne is outstanding. It really gives this gritty feeling of soldiers during WWII, and I really respect Easy Company veterans from what they had been through. Although this is a great mini series, many of the battle scenes irritate me sometimes due to historical facts of the battles. For example the infamous Jagdpanther (the tank hunter) existed at Carentan, which in the actual battle the Germans at Carentan had no tanks to support their infantry. There should also be some P-47D fighters for fire support. It is just awkward to look at a 88mm gun Jagdpanther that has a killing range over 3000 meters had to retreat from a 75mm gun Sherman. And once again the German elite units were depicted as incapable of fighting. I thought Spielberg has a military consultant for making BOB. Anyway not all historic movies are perfect, and I still recommend people to get this DVD.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The Matrix revolutions is, simply put, not a good movie. It barely manages to avoid being a positively bad movie. It is a shame that The Wachowski brothers managed to waste most of the amazing potential that was created in The Matrix. To start, the pacing in this film is unbearably slow in many places. I found myself becoming very tired during many of the pre-final battle scenes; the only characters that actually have any sort of meaning attached to them are the core 3 (morpheus, trinity, neo), while a lot of time is spent on trying to quickly develop incidental characters so that cheap emotion can [try to] be drawn out of them later, but the film fails in this regard. The entire first 20 or so minutes feels like it's not even suppsoed to be there, the cliffhanger from the end of 2 is revealed, and the resolution (other than to the provide a token screen appearance for the Marovingian and the hot Persophene) is pointless and has nothing to do with the rest of the film, the information gained could have been gathered in 5 minutes. To the film's credit, it at least doesnt follow in the inane footsteps of its predecessor \\"Reloaded\\" and just throw in a kung-fu scene and set intervals, just so we can be oooed and aaahed, but it does manage to be incredibly cliche. Again, this is a big disappointment, after the innovation found in the Matrix. The outcome of the final battle was never truly in question, and the \\"surpirse\\" death at the end wasn't really surprising at all. The film just feels like it falls short completely, I wanted something much more EPIC of out it, and it was utterly unable to deliver. Morpeheus, a beacon of charisma in the first two films, has little screen time here, and when we do see him, he is meek beyond comprehension, as nothing has happened to his character to induce this. The special effects, while still impressive, are no longer able to carry the film, as they have indeed become something we have all seen before. The plot, espceially the dialouge, was maddening at times. If another person answered a question with a vague generality along the lines of \\"You already know the answer...\\" I was seirously going to hit the person next to me. It felt very similar to the second film's sophomoric ramblings about causality; giant holes in the film are tried to be covered up by a philosophic air (which, in all honesty, isn't done correctly, not like it could have been), and a fading sense of coolness. Compare this trilogy to the other epic trilogy of our time, The Lord of the Rings. In the Return of the King, a true sense of EPICITY is felt, at the battle of pelennor fields, at Mount Doom (Granted, Jackson had amazing material to draw from, but still); Everything this film needed to be great was in place, an epic setting (the war strewn future), with the fate of the human race at stake, and the broading of scope needed in an epic (from the original with Neo's quest to discover what the matrix is, to the culminating war in this installment), but it falls short in most every aspect.

6305428298|3.0|This could have been a better film without Brenda Blethyn's over the top performance.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill vol. 1, the 4th feature from Quentin Tarantino, delivers in most every way that we would expect from Tarantino. It is sylish as hell; the cinematography especially struck me as being more impressive than in his previous films. The final scene particularly illustrates this, with the frenetic action being conveyed through silhoutte lighting, b&w vs. color and creative shifts between them, impressive camera shots such as the rising shot right before the battle royale, and the pure cinematic epicity of the setting of the final battle between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu. Tarantino's brilliantly dark humor is littered throughout the film as well; Buck describing how to have sex with Uma Thurman's supposedly comatose form may be  offensive and appaling to some, but as it is delivered (and to all Tarantino fans), it is utterly hilarious (little details such as bucks \\"P---- Wagon, the \\"Kaboom!\\" cereal box, and the water fountain that serves as the only noise through much of the climatic battle also stand out). I was also very impressed with(though initially apprehensive of) the anime segment that served as a segue into the Japanese setting, it added a surprising amount of emotion, and set the feel perfectly for the rest of the film. Nearly everything is done right, beyond right. The soundtrack is amazing, as is to be expected for a Tarantino film. He has impeccable taste in music, and seems to innately know what will enhance the film; in some places it is even cheesy (the 1,2,3,4s in the Japanese club) but we know that this is all intended, as is the \\"Feature Presentation\\" card at the beginning; Tarantino is someone who is obviosuly in love with film, and this film is almost an expression of love for all the \\"cool\\" films he watched growing up. I have heard Uma Thurman quoted as saying that this film is \\"pure, epic, Tarantino fantasy\\" and this is a perfect description of it. There is little to no depth, it is not a film that will stun you with its character development, or method acting, but it doesnt pretend to, or even want to. It simply revels in being the epitomy of \\"cool\\", it is an action film that is done in almost all ways, perfectly. Tarantino's gift is found in knowing what will look utterly amazing on film (again, I found myself stunned simply by the appearance of the final, snow-covered courtyard), in being able to write with a great amount of wit and intelligence, and  being able to put the two together with a large amount of what must be called genius. Kill Bill isn't Tarantino's best film (an honor reserved for the utterly brilliant Pulp Fiction, [or is it Reservoir Dogs, it seems to depend on which film ive watched most recently] ), nor will it win the Best Picture Academy Award (which it doesnt deserve anyway), but it is a damn good time. Uma Thurman makes a triumphant return to film, and shocks most everyone in being able to pull off her role as the Bride perfectly; after seeing the film I cannot imagine anyone who could be more convincing. The question remains, can a film be given 5 stars based on style alone? The answer, surprisingly, is yes. I give out 5 stars very, very infequently, to only the very best of films, and while this is by no means the BEST action film ever made, it is certainly a damn good one. repeat viewing may lessen the spectale somewhat, but this reviewer was very impressed (and still is, after 3 viewings) with what he just saw.

6301955595|5.0|Santa Sangre is meant to be appreciated by a few. Some will see it by accident and will not understand it. They will hate it. Just like El Topo, this movie will be great if is seen by someone great, and will be weak if seen by someone weak of mind. The psychological twists in this movie are fantastic. The soundtrack is great, and very representative of the time period. I highly recommemd this movie. Top five of all time.
6305232660|5.0|I think that the blame should go on the advertising campaign that preceded the release of this film.  Paramount tried to play it off as another \\"Armageddon\\", and so people looking for mindless, testosterone-laden entertainment were completely put off by the profound, philosophical nature of Deep Impact's story line.  The title of the film itself seems to indicate that the film is a deep emotional analysis of how people react when they know they are about to die, as opposed to a film about blowing up a chunk of ice hurtling towards the Earth.  Granted, there are liberties taken in the scientific accuracy department, but that doesn't detract from the story unless you are really uptight about such things.  If you go to every movie hoping they will be completely scientifically accurate, then you will be disappointed all the time.<BR>So, when you watch this film, don't look at it as being a high-adrenaline action film - look at it as a film about sacrifice, making peace before one dies, and the triumph of the human spirit.
B000006045|5.0|Mezzanine influenced a whole generation and united  numerous people all over the world on the Massive Attack message board. But by all its greatness, you'll still discover particular songs you like better than others.<br />Take \\"Angel\\": a mysterious voice is floating above a tribal beat, making battle to a menacing bass guitar. When the sweeping guitars take over, there's no escape anymore. You're captivated by this \\"Angel\\", your mystique companion on the way to the \\"Mezzanine\\". \\"Risingson\\" finds you trapped in the wrong movie: whistling winds are    <BR>followed by helicopter motor sounds. They seem to foresay the end of the world...Wrong! The causes of so much pathos are a petty alcohol problem and a party you're dying to leave- this is how overstatement's done! More of this on the excellent title track. It deals with people's common weaknesses- that is if you bother to decifer the lyrics. If not, you'll think it's about stealing holy relics on a stormy Friday 13 night. \\"Black Milk\\" is either the perfect soundtrack to your most intriguing nightmare, or the best background sex music. \\"Group four\\" offers more of that sexy tension: imagine rocking out with Eleanor of Aquitaine's ghost and you get the full picture. This is what \\"Mezzanine\\" excels at: taking the listener to a different world and painting it with the most luminous, vivid colors. <br />As there is the dark side of the moon, it's only logical for \\"Mezzanine\\" to have a more light, mellow side. \\"Teardrop\\" is the ultimate chillout song where Liz Fraser impersonates a crystal tear. \\"Man next door\\" surprises with its semi-optimistic mood, Horace Andy's voice can't but lift you to a higher ground. Even the filler instrumental  <BR>\\"Exchange\\" sounds beautiful on the vocal version. Sure, some of those tracks may have a bit of that letdown feel but that's the fate of decent songs on truly exceptional albums.<br />Then you've got \\"Inertia Creeps\\" and \\"Dissolved Girl\\", the tracks that build the bridge between the brooding and the relaxing tunes. Both of them illustrate the emotional whirlwind which defines Massive Attack's music.<br />I could go on for ages just reliving the feelings this album evokes in me, but a short, laconic conclusion will do: \\"Mezzanine\\" is the album you need to enrich bleak days of routine work. I warn you not to overdo it 'cause addiction can end in hatred.<br />Note to the reader: It took me a long time to come up with this review. I was never sure from which angle to write- MA's musical evolution, the clash of egos in the project, the fictional trip-hop genre etc. However, I decided the music is the only thing which matters, and not the hype around it.

B00008UZPD|5.0|If you're looking for a movie with beautiful choreography, this is definitely one to watch.  Known as 'Gun Kata', the guns are said to be an extension of the hand.  Think of samurai's with guns.  The storyline is predictable but don't let that reason turn you off from watching this movie.
B00003CWTI|5.0|There seems to be two main categories of comments on Magnolia.  Those that thought it was brilliant and moving, and those that thought it lacked interconnectedness and was perhaps somewhat pedantic.  While I can understand some of the later argument, I really can't agree with it. O.K., I concur that all the elements don't always appear to fit together as a seamless package.  Got it.  And that many of the characters who are not portrayed as typical &quot;bad guys&quot;, nonetheless, have SIGNIFICANT flaws of moral character.  And, of course, Tom Cruise's character does use the &quot;C&quot; word more than once.  <br />Still, this movie is, without a doubt, powerful and stirring.  It WILL make you feel something and that is the true criterion by which to judge a movie such as this.  As an aside, a suggestion for viewing.  Pause for a moment after Aimee Mann's &quot;Save Me&quot; musical montage if you need a little break.  The beauty of a DVD (or VHS) format is that you can pause for a bit, and it is appopriate in a film such as this.  I don't feel like there is any urgent momentum to be lost at this point.<br />Bottom line.  This movie has great power.  Admittedly, there are many who will most assuredly not enjoy it, but I would urge anyone to give a viewing. Just don't expect any great moral clarity, or for everything to be nicely wrapped up at the end.  That's what action/adventure is for.  Try to enjoy it for what it is, and not what you might wish it could be.

0385504209|2.0|I decided to see what all the hype was about + read The Da Vinci Code. It's a little hard to understand why this became such a mega-bestseller and cultural phenom.<br />Dan Brown gives us a by-the-numbers thriller. It jazzes things up with a lot of puzzle clues the reader can try to solve with the characters - and some are clever enough. He also adds in some semi-interesting socio-historical perspectives on religion and art. Combined with the easy reading style of the prose, that can explain some level of interest.<br />But then there are the downsides to the novel, and there are many.<br />The quality of the writing is really bad in many places. The dialogue resembles nothing actual people would say. Typical \\"conversation\\":<br />#1: \\"[supposedly shocking revelation]\\"<br />#2: \\"Are you trying to tell me that [supposedly shocking revelation]???\\"<br />#3: \\"Yes, I am saying [supposedly shocking revelation]\\"<br />It goes on and on like that, and it gets irritating, as does the ham-handed way Brown tries to hold off on revealing information until it's (supposedly) more dramatic. The book takes itself VERY seriously, without a trace of wit or style. Rather than say \\"this could symbolize that\\", the characters always have to say \\"when one looks at it symbologically\\". (\\"Symbologist\\", and its permutations, seems to be a presumtuous word the book enjoys using ad nauseum to inflate its own importance.)<br />One of the \\"big secrets\\" - about what one character saw another doing ten years ago - is a yawner of an anticlimax. The main protagonists register absolute zero on the personality meter. Absolute zero also describes the amount of heat they generate, though of course they end up together.<br />Brown also plays fast and loose with real life stuff. Did you ever have a college professor who always declared that his one, overarching theory explained absolutely everything? That's what goes on here. Brown throws in enough real-life people, groups, events, art etc to make his fictional work sound legit, but mixes it with pure fiction - maybe hoping you won't be able to tell the difference.<br />[One real laugher: Isaac Newton is repeatedly mentioned in the plot. In real life, Newton was deeply anti-social, devoutly Christian and almost certainly died a virgin. His biographer, James Gleick, describes the physicist's attitude towards sex as \\"morbid distaste.\\" The Da Vinci Code posits Newton as part of a pagan group that worships the \\"sacred feminine\\" - another phrase Brown beats to death - and engages in ritual sex. Yeah, right.]<br />It's not the worst thing I've ever read, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.ork sound legit, but mixes it with pure fiction - maybe hoping you won't be able to tell the difference.<br />[One real laugher: Isaac Newton is repeatedly mentioned in the plot.

B00013PHGS|4.0|I was very reluctant to buy this album...my experience with \\"10,000 Hz Legend\\" almost killed any feelings for Air. They had made one brilliant album (Premieres Symptomes) and one near-brilliant one (Moon Safari). Whither Air? Well, \\"Talkie Walkie\\" (despite the title) is somewhat excellent. They have lost their fetish for bad 1980s-era synthesizers and euro-trash techno for real music. They returned to their atmospherics, blended with retro keyboards, to make a Euro-pop album that isn't Eur-awful. Even the vocals match the music.  Stands up to repeated listening. Hopefully \\"10,000 Hz\\" will be an anomaly.
B00006LWSF|4.0|I bought this album off the back of 8-mile (where else)and at first thought it was a massive let down. I was wrong though, even thought its no where near the standards of The Eminem Show or The Marshal Mathers LP it does have its moments. The tracks by eminem are the best by far but we get to see 50 cent with one of the best tracks he has done (including those on get rich or die tryin) in places to go (5) which i would give 10/10. Well here is the best traks on the album (out of all 16) so if there are enough good buys for you go for it, if your an em fan do it now!<BR>Rabbit Run (10/10)<BR>Places To Go (10/10)<BR>Love Me (9/10)<BR>8 Mile (8/10)<BR>Rap Game (7/10)<BR>8 Miles and Runnin' (7/10)<BR>Battle (7/10)<BR>the rest is up to you to either buy or leave, its worth a shot though especaily when your wating for streight from the lab ep to come out!
0385504209|2.0|i admit i got caught up in the hype and read this solely based on other people's reactions. my final take on this piece is that, while entertaining, it's just another cheesy mystery novel. a large part of this book is focused on an alternate history involving jesus christ and mary magdalene but, while interesting, i can't take anything in this book as fact in the same way i won't let the movie pearl harbor grant any awareness about what really happened on dec 7 1941. the author went as far as stating that opus dei and the priory of sion were real organizations on the first page of the first chapter.. perhaps leading the reader to think that their role in the novel is indicative of their role in the real world.<br />wondering if opus dei really existed i googled them to discover, wow, they really do exist. i mean &quot;wow&quot; as in &quot;why did the author choose to defame a real catholic organization.&quot; he depicts opus dei followers as corporal mortifiers, racketeers, fanatics and even murderers. whether or not this is really true doesn't vindicate the author because since this is a novel and not an academic work there is no ethical responsibility to portray the truth. so in reading the user is coerced to understand the opus dei characters in the exact way the author characterizes them in the novel (specifically &quot;silas&quot;). we see the same issues in movies where viewers are led to believe something about history (or the real world) when in fact the story being told is a work of fiction (ala apollo 13, saving private ryan, braveheart and my favorite example, pearl harbor which was sold as a movie about 12/7/41 but actually had almost nothing to do with it).<br />da vinci code is a novel, i know! i know! but it seems to me that people would rather get their facts from fictionalized stories than actual facts. i remember when pearl harbor came out everyone was commenting on how much they learned about wwii and the japanese invasion and all the while i could barely keep myself from puking all over these history students. so my rant has a point, you'll be surprised... in that i got the same reaction from people about this novel. &quot;oh it's so fascinating, i didn't know that da vinci did all those things, that opus dei was a bad religious organization and that there is a secret grail society blah blah blah...&quot; as i mentioned earlier, while this is &quot;interesting&quot; i think the interest merits further investigation and until then can be categorized as &quot;entertainment&quot; and nothing else.<br />so what drove me down this long path, you're asking yourself. well my first quest for the truth involved a visit to opus dei's website whereupon i discovered a link to a public statement in reaction to this novel. reading this statement affirmed my belief that you can't take anything at face value. i even feel sorry for them b/c this novel is so popular and they are getting a bad rap because of it.<br />so my final analysis of this book is what my high school english teacher calls a &quot;tv book.&quot; that is, a piece of literature that has no more value than to entertain ... which is why i think alot of people like this book. just don't mistake it for being &quot;informative.&quot;ld barely keep myself from puking all over these history students. so my rant has a point, you'll be surprised... in that i got the same reaction from people about this novel. &quot;oh it's so fascinating, i didn't know that da vinci did all those things, that opus dei was a bad religious organization and that there is a secret grail society blah blah blah...&quot; as i mentioned earlier, while this is &quot;interesting&quot; i think the interest merits further investigation and until then can be categorized as &quot;entertainment&quot; and nothing else.<br />so what drove me down this long path, you're asking yourself. well my first quest for the truth involved a visit to opus dei's website whereupon i discovered a link to a public statement in reaction to this novel. reading this statement affirmed my belief that you can't take anything at face value. i even feel sorry for them b/c this novel is so popular and they are getting a bad rap because of it.<br />so my final analysis of this book is what my high school english teacher calls a &quot;tv book.&quot; that is, a piece of literature that has no more value than to entertain ... which is why i think alot of people like this book. just don't mistake it for being &quot;informative.&quot;
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Okay, my friend said she liked this cd, so i decided to pick it up on a whim. now, let me tell you, i havent always liked ms.spears, because i grew up with the whole britney vs. christina dispute (as well as *nsync vs. backstreet, but that's a different story...). anyways, i popped it in my cd player, and was PLEASANTLY surprised. if you are a buyer looking on amazon for a review on whether or not to buy this album, you will find a lot of \\"BRITNEY SPEARS ..., YAY CHRISTINA!!!\\" stuff. I'm going to give a song-by-song review of \\"In the Zone.\\"<br />1. Me Against the Music f/Madonna-an okay song, waayyyy overplayed on the radio, though. 4/5<BR>2.(i got that)boom boom(f/ying yang twins)another okay song, im not so sure about that whole banjo deal, however...4.5/5<BR>3.Showdown-great song! i love the beat and chorus! 5/5<BR>4.Breathe on Me-yes, it has some sexual innuendo in it, but nonetheless a fantastic song.5/5<BR>5.Early Mornin'-One of my least favorites. The only part i dont like is that the background singers take up the majority of the song.2.5/5<BR>6.Toxic-Britney's 2nd single and in my opinion, one of the best songs on the album. incredibly catchy, it will have you singing it over and over inside your head all day.10/5<BR>7.Outrageous-a decent song, not my favorite though.4/5<BR>8.Touch of my Hand-ah yes, another sexual song. I do love this one though, another of my favorites. 10/5<BR>9.The Hook Up-background singers take over on this one too. yuck. 2/5<BR>10.Shadow-a decent ballad, pretty good. 4.5/5<BR>11.Brave New Girl-i absolutely DESPISE this song! way to techno! uck! 1/5<BR>12.Everytime-another of my favorites! an excellent ballad, really shows off brit's voice. 10/5<BR>13.Me Against the Music Remix-good remix, but still me against the music. 4/5<br />all in all, in the zone is a good cd. the songs vary in composition, and the beats are all different, which i like. go pick it up!
B00006G8HX|5.0|This is a great film with a great story, great special effects, great acting, great action and great human emotions.  This film makes Leonard Nimoy's Star Trek directorial debut.  He would then go on to direct Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home & offered the job of directing Star Trek: Generations.      Nimoy dose a good job of showing us the charaters and how the death of Spock is affecting them all.  He also adds some grit to the Klingons and shows them to be the most ruthless aliens in the galaxy.  Christopher Lloyd does a superb job of playing Kirk's nemesis in this film.      The Special Features are great and show in-depth footage on the making of the film, cast and crew interviews, and how the special effects were achieved.  If you enjoyed Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan you will also love this film.      Join the Search!
1556589433|5.0|I agree with others that this is an excellent movie--Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, are wonderful, etc.  I saw it first in a movie theatre when it first came out, and found it's tragedy very painful to watch, yet compelling due to the quality of the film (and actors).  In later years I have tried to watch the movie several times on VHS or TV, and tried to read the book as well.  I can watch and read hour after hour of true crime, but this story, either in book or movie form, is perhaps the most depressing piece of work I've ever encountered.  <br />First of all, the tragedy of the holocaust is unspeakable except for the fact that it must be spoken about.  That element of the film, displayed through Sophie's horrific experience unfolds slowly through painful flashbacks throughout.  Second, the tragic personal choice she is forced to make--which of her children will be killed--speaks for itself.  Thirdly, the tragedy of her lover's mental illness, so poingnant as we watch others with the same or similar illnesses today--homeless, untreated, misunderstood...so many perishing alone in our cold and drug-laden cities.  Superior intelligence, it seems, fuels the tragedy by giving the false impression that the victim has the ability to have more control over the disease than he/she actually does.  And finally, the ultimate depressing element of the film was the hope that both Sophie and her lover tried to cling to; displayed in bursts of reverie, joy, and engagement in life...like the final emergence of a hand grasping a slippery float, before it sinks.<br />Perhaps others can tolerate this movie better than I, but it struck a haunting chord that has never left since I first viewed the movie.
B000067CPX|2.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are trying too hard to make melodies, listen to the stronger Blood Sugar Sex Magik instead, or possibly Mothers' Milk..
B00005JME0|5.0|This movie is amazing due to the concept of the \\"butterfly effect\\". Many times, alone in my bed, I have wondered what my life would be like if one minor detail would have changed. This movie takes that concept to another level as you watch Ashton Kutcher change minor details in his life to make a better outcome for his friends and family. The love of his life, played by Amy Smart, is Kucher's motivation in changing the past to save her. This movie is a thriller, drama, love story, action packed perfection that everyone must see. The reason I give this movie five stars is because of its originality. I have never before watched a movie that made me think back to my childhood and wonder if fate is only little details.
B00005JLEU|5.0|A wonderful story where an 8 year old girl gets stuck in a spirit world, which can be a very frightening place.  But with courage,ingenuity, and a little help from some new friends, she can find her way home.  Chihiro is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, but where Alice seemed to remain untouched by her experience (which makes it more suitable for very young children), Chihiro grows more confident and brave as she faces her fears.    A four-year old watching this can find the stuff of nightmares, so I do not recommend this for K or Pre-K kids.
0380002930|5.0|This novel is without a doubt the best ever written. It is a book that will make you think about life and death. When I found out about it I thought that it might be a little silly. But after I began to read it I realized how wrong I had been about thinking it was going to be silly. It was anything but silly. Watership Down makes you see what it is like from an animals point of view. I thought this story was sad but very good. If I could rate it more than 5 stars I would. Do not hesitate to buy this book. Buy it because you won't regret it.
B00005JKHP|5.0|'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is my favorite Star Trek movie.  This 'Directors Edition' improves the film a great deal.  The new special effects bring Robert Wise's vision of 'The Motion Picture' to life.  Nothing has been done to defeat the original purpose of the film.      Additions include a new soundtrack, restored image, computer generated images (certain scenes), deletion of some scenes, and a different color scheme to the credits.    Special Features go in-depth on the new Director's Edition, how the film came to life in 1979 and what Robert Wise wanted to change in order to make the film as it was intended to be.  Also included are deleted scenes and rare storyboards.    Finally after 22 years 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is finished!  This DVD needs to be in your DVD library!  To do otherwise would be illogical!
B000002JKA|5.0|It was fantasic from...&quot;6:00 in a christmas morning...&quot; man as soon as this album started I hear the drums go crazy and I thought &quot;whoa ok they got a good drummer but how about the rest of the band?&quot; I got totally blown away by the rest of the band. Definetly recommended
B0000B3B95|5.0|I thought this movie was great. I think the reason that a lot of people did not like this movie is because they were expecting it to be more of an action/adventure movie. It is however, a drama about a man learning about his long-forgotten past and how he faces it. I especially liked Nick Nolte's performance as his once caring-turned insane father. The way they show scenes like a comic book was a nice touch too. The dog fighting scene was great, and Eric Bana does excellent as Bruce. I guess the decision of whether you would like this movie or not, however is mostly up to you
B000002MP2|5.0|Since today marks the 10th Anniversary of this album being released (2/1/94 - 2/1/04), I thought I would come back and write another review for it. (I wrote another one a few years ago, it's back there somewhere)<br />As everybody knows, Nirvana's 1991 album \\"Nevermind\\" was the mainstream's first real taste of punk influence. But it wasn't until 1994 that the mainstream got its first glance at two-minute, three-chord, simple punk-alternative songs about growing up in teenage wasteland. And that glance was Green Day's \\"Dookie\\". <br />I'll never forget when I was eight years old (or so), buying a copy just to see what all the fuss was about. It was my first modern rock album, and, just like Holden McNeil said, what an album to start with. Catchy songs that just SCREAM out the spirit of the early-to-mid-1990's. I'll never forget thinking how cool I was because I was in third grade and I owned an album with cursing on it. Playing Sonic 2 and listening to \\"She\\" on a warm summer's day. Getting into heated \\"GREEN DAY RULES! ACE OF BASE DROOLS!\\" arguments. But I digress.<br />Anyway, onto the album. If you've never heard this album, then may I just ask what rock you've been under for 10 years. Green Day used Dookie (their major label debut, but third album altogether) to catapult them to becoming one of the most popular and influential alternative rock acts of the decade. (And that's saying a lot, considering that decade also saw acts like Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins.) This album is still catchy, angry, snotty, fast, short, simple, sweet, and a classic, from the opening song \\"Burnout\\" to the closing, vitriolic \\"FOD\\" and the silly closing track \\"All By Myself\\".<br />Anyway, may I just say, happy 10th anniversary, Dookie. This album will remain a classic and an influence for years to come.
B000002UAR|5.0|First off, I am of the Beatles generation. I grew up with them.  They inspired me to play guitar for 30 years.  \\"Revoulution\\" is more important now than it was when it was first released. <br />Back in 1965 when this album was released, I was just another 13 year old Beatles fan waiting in line at the department store to buy their newest record.  I don't think any of us understood how much more meaning this album would have forty years later. <BR> <BR>Just listen to Lennon on \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\":   <BR>\\"Running everywhere at such a speed,<BR> Doin' fine, there's no need,<BR> Please don't spoil my day,<BR> I'm miles away...\\"<br />or on \\"She Said She Said\\":<BR>\\"She said 'you don't understand what I said',<BR> I said, 'no, no, no, you're wrong.<BR> When I was a boy,<BR> everything was right, <BR> everything was right'\\".<br />I hear these lyrics now and I understand them as only a 50 year old man could and a thirteen year did not.  What more evidence of immortality could one want?  Did Lennon know he was writing things containing such levels of meaning?  What I'm talking about is not when a work of art has meaning for one generation, but when it speaks to generations of listeners.  This is the mark of true Art and is why people will be listening to the Beatles forever. If you are a fan of pop music and don't have this album, you need to get it now.
B0000683DH|5.0|Considered to be the best Star Trek film we find our heroes confronting an old nemesis from their past (The Original Series, Season One, \\"Space Seed\\").  Ricardo Montalban returns as Khan who is hell bent on getting revenge on Kirk for the death of his wife.  William Shatner gives his best performance in this film as does Montalban and Nimoy.      The special effects are truly spectacular.  You almost feel like you're there.  The footage also looks better than it did on the single disk release.    The Director's Edition adds about 4-Minutes of footage to the film that was not seen in the theatrical release (The same version shown on ABC in the mid-80's).  The special features are nice and explore the evolution of the film.  A feature on special effects takes you back to how they developed the Mutara Nebula sequence and how the ships attacked each other and how they made it look real.  Plus many more specials.    You really can't go wrong with this film.  At the end of the universe lies vengeance.
B000059ZT4|5.0|The reviewer above said it best. If you are a roots reggae fan you will find disc one to be your holy grail.  It is the band's version, released in Jamaica, not the overproduced version released in America.  There is a huge difference in every song, except the fantastic &quot;midnight ravers&quot; and two extra songs are included on the Jamaican version.  If you have never heard disc one (Jamaican version) you have never heard Catch a Fire, that simple.  With Peter arranging the harmonies, Bunny hitting the high notes and Bob's amazing songwriting this is the Wailer's true masterpiece.  In the American version (original release) most of the harmonies are covered up with synthesizers or overdubbed with Bob doing backup vocals. This CD is musical kind bud and proves Jah is great.  Enjoy Brothers and Sisters!!!!!!!!!!
B00005LOUP|1.0|This movie would have been more aptly titled, &quot;How Ron Howard Stole My Three Dollars, Gave Me a Massive Headache, and Wasted Ninety Minutes of My Time Which Would Have Been Better Spent Staring at a Blank Wall.&quot;  Okay, so I'm not a kid.  Maybe kids enjoyed it.  Kids also enjoy eating boogers and farting.  When this movie ended, I went to my tool box and beat myself in the head with a hammer for half an hour because it felt so much better than watching this celluloid atrocity.<BR>Did they do a good job of making Jim Carrey look like the Grinch?  Yes.  That's about the only positive thing you can say about the movie.  Never before has the term &quot;wretched excess&quot; been more appropriately applied.  This movie is by far the noisiest, most grotesque excercise in stupidity imaginable.  Why couldn't they keep it simple like the beloved book?  Why fill every frame with garish, pointless clutter?  The horrible mole-faced people of Whoville are the stuff of nightmares.  The sets are eyesores.  Heck, the dog isn't even cute!<BR>Adults, be warned: if you are coerced by a well-meaning child into watching this ridiculous mess, you will welcome the urge to vomit afterwards, in the vain hope that doing so will purge the experience from your memory.  Hide all sharp objects--or heck, even blunt ones--before viewing.  It's worse than &quot;Showgirls.&quot;  Cripes, it's even worse than &quot;Glitter&quot;!!!
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols were one of the most important punk bands, but their recorded legacy is a brief one.  This is, in fact, their only \\"real\\" album.  But it is a great one.  It's one of the most ferocious albums ever recorded, featuring many songs that have come to be recognized as classics.  The Sex Pistols recorded a few other odds and ends, which have their merits, but this is the only Sex Pistols CD that is a \\"must get\\".
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Not Evolutionary, not revolutionary, but good. A vast improvement over their first album, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is an offbeat collection of slacker tunes that can satisfy any listerner of music, even if you didn't like &quot;Is This It&quot;, you should still give this a try.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Nicholas Meyer has out done himself again.  This is a great DVD with great special features.  The additions to the film are subtle and will not change the tone of the film.  Star Trek VI finds us on our last outing with the entire TOS crew.  It is a fitting end and gives a great segway into the TNG films.      The special features are well done and go into depth on how the story was brought about, Klingon Lore, art, and a farewell to Deforest Kelley.  There are many other features that will make this film a must have for any Star Trek fan.    NOTE: Read the 'Text Commentary' to find out all the new features added to the film.      You will enjoy this one!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Thank you, Eric Clapton, for giving us the blessing of this beautiful and moving concert in honor of George. I grew up listening to the Beatles, and always had a particular affection for George and Ringo, the two 'stabilizing' members of the band. I always appreciated George's quiet consideration before speaking, and his thoughtfulness and the fundamental goodness of his heart. When George died, I was deeply saddened like many millions of others, and thought that no tribute or monument could ever do him justice.<br />I was wrong. The Concert for George, primarily organized by his long time friend Eric Clapton, provided just the catharsis that his friends and fans needed. I was amazed that these close personal friends and relatives (Dhani was on stage the entire set) didn't get choked up at any point during the show, because I sure did (during 'Photograph'.) In fact the show was hard for me to watch the first time as I wanted to hear George singing. Eric said it best in an interview, though, when he explained that at first rehearsals were tough to get through, but the rehearsals and show provided a mechanism of grieving to all his personal friends. That explained it brilliantly: They had time to work through it, while the viewer at home did not. (Who says rock stars can't be truly insightful?) The musicians obviously worked very hard to get this just right and they succeeded brilliantly: this DVD beautifully captures it all.<br />There are actually two DVDs in the set, one is the unabridged concert, and the other is the edited concert for theatrical release and some short subjects. I recommend watching the unabridged concert first. It opens with Anoushka Shankar playing some Indian music, which, of course, George loved. I don't really care for it, but it was soulful and well performed. George was a huge Monty Python fan, and the Pythons were up next and performed &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; after a heartwarming spoof of a eulogy by Michael Palin that George would have loved. For me it was all good, but some of it was amazing.  Ringo was a standout with &quot;Photograph&quot;, which is still the best Ringo song, and a song that Ringo and George wrote together, and &quot;Honey Don't&quot;, an old Carl Perkins song that George loved. Eric Clapton was wonderful on everything he performed on; I particularly liked his pseudo-duet with Paul on &quot;Something&quot;, and with the whole ensemble on &quot;Wah Wah&quot;, which had breathtaking percussion, and, of course, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, a song veritably made for him.<br />Without question though, the greatest performer in the show was Joe Brown, a major institution in early British rock, but today relatively unknown in the US. Joe's main set started with a hauntingly beautiful rendition of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, and then went to &quot;That's The Way It Goes&quot;, a song I have always loved, but never got the acclaim it deserved. Joe also closed the show with the dreamy &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot;, and he sang it like he meant it. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the beautiful &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; by the multitalented Billy Preston, who would have won the best dressed award.<br />There were a couple of weaker performances to be seen. None that were overtly bad, but they certainly were not up to the standards of the rest of the show. The primary offenders here were Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who are normally great, but came across as lifeless and flat. I also found Jeff Lynne's voice to sound a bit tired, especially when he sang a verse of &quot;Wah Wah&quot; and to a lesser degree on &quot;The Inner Light.&quot; I (really) hate to say it, but I also found Paul's version of &quot;For You Blue&quot; a bit dull. I think it's interesting that Paul picked a song of George's from &quot;Let It Be&quot;, an album where tempers ran high and contentiousness prevailed; perhaps that has clouded my vision a bit on the subject. Despitethat, it was wonderful seeing Paul and Ringo play together again, and I have to wonder if that's the last time we'll be able to see that.<br />Extras include a behind the scenes and rehearsal video, which is very interesting, a wonderful interview video, and a backstage video of the Monty Python crew. All are well done and worth watching.<br />For any fan of George's this is a must. I never thought that I could like this DVD as much as I do since I knew I would miss hearing George on the songs. After a few viewings, though, I now feel happy when I watch it, and have found it to be a fitting tribute to a great man. While we will always miss you, George, I will always be grateful for this beautiful and befitting tribute.<br />I'll see you in my dreams.e that, it was wonderful seeing Paul and Ringo play together again, and I have to wonder if that's the last time we'll be able to see that.<br />Extras include a behind the scenes and rehearsal video, which is very interesting, a wonderful interview video, and a backstage video of the Monty Python crew.

B000002UB3|5.0|How do you write a review for the greatest album of all time? Well, I'll try. <BR>Recorded after &quot;Let It Be&quot;, they all knew this would likely be their last effort before everyone went on to solo careers. John had made his intentions clear to the others that he was going to leave, and despite all this, The Bealtes were able to come together (no pun intended) and create a masterpiece. The first hlaf of the album is mostly masterful singles - especially &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; and &quot;Here Comes The Sun.&quot; The second half of the album is arguably better than the first, with two main medleys of songs.<BR>Rounding out this whole album and The Beatles' entire career as a group is fittingly &quot;The End.&quot; This is an essential album for everyone to have in their record collection.<br />If you arent' yet a Beatles fan, this is the album to get. The Beatles at their best and a final showing of unity after inner turmoil.
B00003CWTI|3.0|Magnolia was a very good movie, with an emotional plot that dealt with unrequited love, addiction, feelings of failure, angst and forgiveness. All of its characters had serious issues they were trying their hardest to conceal or get rid of (Claudia,played by Melora Walters, had a serious cocaine addiction and was angry at her father, and Tom Cruise, an actor I can't stand, playing an intriguing role as a chauvinist sex god to hide his feelings of resentment towards his father when he took care of his cancer-ridden mother at the age of 14), and the movie seemed to be heading towards a relevatory ending, but it seriously backfired. Instead of self-discovery, it rained frogs, which killed the movie for me. Still, it was adequate enough to watch for 2/3 of this 3 hour movie.
6303921248|5.0|I have watched this mini-series three times now, and I can't get over how proper and reserved society was in 19th century England. How absolutely magnificent the countryside scenes are, and the period costumes are so gorgeous. The transformation in Darcy is fantastic, and to think of what a grande mistress Elizabeth will be of his estate. I fell in love with Darcy too, but he was indeed insufferable at the beginning! How could they allow the spoiled Lydia to get away with such a conceited attitude! I wonder how jealous she felt after finding out about Jane's and Elizabeth's nuptials!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not since Nevermind has there been an album this worshipped by kids and critics alike. Easily one of the most complete and perfect albums of the 90's, Ok Computer has been influencing since it's release, and has seemed to touch peoples lives like few albums have the power to. This is an album of darkness and inhumanity, but it's so sincere and beautiful, theres hope in there too, which is an aspect often ignored. Ok Computer represents a generation, a time, a feeling. This album will always have a place in the hearts of the people who have experienced it on its highest level.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Alright...Britney Spears does it again, she comes back, new album, new sound, but she's Britney Spears. It's probably Miss Pop tryin' another trendy BOMT or OIDIA because her previous album Britney, didn't do that well. Such assumptions and anti-britney's are too critical. I am in LOVE with this album. It's new and just outright cool! <br />-Me against the Music: Madonna and Britney rock the house! Excellent choice as first single, hip hop and pop go well together. <BR>-Boom Boom: I would like this song alot more without the constant rapper yelling into the microphone about how britney should shake her ass! enough already! let her sing. But, i know for a fact that the R & B fans will like this song alot. <BR>-Showdown:It's very sexual in the sense well, the whole song is about make up sex. And you would probably think right away that it's a bad song, but it not. This song has a calm beat and is very fun to sing to believe it or not. <BR>-Breathe On Me: Woah! this song is awesome! It's going to be a very fun single and European audiences are gonna lurve the tone and mood. Once again, calm song, great beat. We don't need to touch, just breathe...<BR>-Early Mornin': Hit or Miss? Errr, it's not the best song on the album, but it's a hit. Moby helps support Britney's new provocative approach with a song about bein' a bad girl. EM is cute, not that great, but a nice song to put on during commercial break of sex and the city. <BR>-Toxic: Mwahahaha! This song will be loved by everyone! You anti-brits can't hide! Come on sing it with me! You're toxic, I'm slippin' under, taste of a poisen paradise, I'm addicted to you and don't ya know that your toxic! Reminds me of one of those comic book hero shows. You will love this song, promise. <BR>-Outrageous: This not so hidden message in this song: I'm Britney Spears, I'm hot and I can probably buy the city of Los Angelos. Hip hop fits her quite well<BR>-Touch of My Hand: It got these words in it that could make u slightly uncomfortable, but when ur home alone and in ur room listen to ITZ, turn up this song. The smooth foreign sound and carefully placed words make the song really quite fabulous.<BR>-Hook up: Admit it, this song will make you shake it at the club or just lip sync around the house. It's a club song, it's fun and groovy, probably not ur favorite song on the album but it's def. one of my top 5. <BR>-Shadow: Meaningful ballad and very pop. Listen closely, such excellent sound. <BR>-Brave New Girl: Britney raps! She raps! it's quite funny and quite cool, she sounds like she had a good time making this song. Very upbeat party music! <BR>-Everytime: She wrote this two years ago in Germany, obviously after the break up with Timberlake. This ballad was written by her and will so grab at your heart. <BR>-MATM Remix: It's ok, i like the original version of the song better. <BR>~*(Bonus tracks if u decide to go for the Aus/UK Album)*~<BR>The Answer: P.diddy works it! Britney's more hip hop song of the album, i highly suggest paying the extra buck for this song. <BR>Don't Hang Up: Back to olden baby one more time days, except better. Once again, on an exclusive song she reaches her potential and stretches those vocal chords. This song proves Spears still has the X factor.
B000021YQV|4.0|This album seems short but other than that its pretty good. I love the songs Chop suey, Bounce, Toxicity, and Shimmey. All in all, pretty good CD, i recommend buying it.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush Of Blood To The Head by Coldplay<BR>Capitol<BR>Explicit: No<BR>Best Song: The Scientist<BR>Worst Song: Green Eyes<br />A Rush Of Blood To The Head, is, simply, one of the things that got me into my current music obsession. Sweet, simple, mellow but never boring, Coldplay here proves themselves as one of, if not, THE first great new musical artists of the new millenium. The album opens with &quot;Politik&quot;, a soft-rock apocalypse of sorts that begins the wonderful brit-rock extravaganza to come. &quot;In My Place&quot; is the lovely first single, with some cute pop trappings but harboring a touch of sincere grace. Then we have &quot;Daylight&quot;, a great upbeat track that actually took a while to grow on me, the wonderful crooning and genius piano of &quot;Clocks&quot;, the overplayed but still significant second single, the hypnotizing, almost Pink Floydesque &quot;A Whisper&quot;. By the time you reach &quot;The Scientist&quot;, no doubt the greatest single since Radiohead's &quot;No Surprises&quot;, you'll be enamored. Sure, there are weak spots, (&quot;Green Eyes&quot; teeters on and actually crosses the line between mellowly acoustic and boring, the aforementioned &quot;A Whisper&quot; gets tired after a while) but this is a real treasure. The last two tracks, the crowd-pleasing title track and the genius melancholy that is &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, leave you hungry and wanting more. But no need to worry. Coldplay isn't going ANYWHERE. This is merely the beginning, and what a great beginning it is.<br />Final Grade: A (between A and A-, but The Scientist is good enough to propel it to an A)
B00000HZH7|1.0|It's amazing how many people praise this album, because basically this is not an album worthy of praise. We get very poor lyrical writing, very poor singing talent, very poor musicianship. This album literally hurts to listen too. The production is actually worse than Venom's first couple of albums. Possessed didn't last long, and after hearing this, I can see and hear why. They only reason I can think of why people praise this CD is because Possessed is considered one of the founders of &quot;Black/Death Metal&quot;. Whoopy! Not. If you want &quot;evil&quot; lyrics, go listen to Venom. At least they have talent.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin is without doubt the best rock and roll band ever. Their musical background, the quality of their musical performance and their originality make the band conformed by Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Bonhan and John Paul Jones unbeatable. I loved Zeppelin since I listened &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, when I was 16. My taste for their music has been refining day after day since then and I think I am very critic of their music sometimes. But this Live CD is one of the best I have ever listened. I think it is even better that &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;. I recommend this CD highly
078401213X|4.0|this movie is very complex and I don't even fully understand which is why I'm still looking at it but I can tell it's a great movie. it's about a mathematician who stumbles upon a 216-digit number with whom some other people are looking for. at some point it lands him in trouble and running for his life. can tell you anymore. also I have some questions about the film like what was that sitting brain and what was that wrinkle on his forehead? If any of you guys know the answers to these questions, e-mail me at cupofmetal@aol.com
B000003CKH|5.0|Fashion Nugget by Cake<BR>Zomba/Volcano<BR>Explicit: Yes (\\"Nugget\\" is pretty much is the only offender, but it's a pretty good one)<BR>Best Song: Friend Is A Four-Letter Word<BR>Worst Song: She'll Come Back To Me<br />Ah, Cake. The first thing to mention about Cake (Because you just can't talk about Cake's big break without talking about Cake themselves) is John McCrea. McCrea's voice is absolutely brilliant. The guy sings with a half-funky, half-monotone voice that at times almost sounds like he's speaking. Not only is the monotone singing approach unique and absolutely addicting, McCrea can do more than that. He can do anything, from Country yelps, (\\"Stickshifts And Safetybelts\\") to pseudo-rap. (\\"The Distance\\") As a matter of fact, it's a real shame their claim to fame is \\"The Distance\\", since while that is a spectacular song, there are plenty of joys here. \\"Frank Sinatra\\" is a wonderful little gem with a spectacularly memorable chorus:<br />\\"We know of an ancient radiation<BR>That affects dismembered constallations<BR>A faintly gimmering radio station<BR>While Frank Sinatra sings Stormy Weather<BR>The flies and the spiders get along together<BR>Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record.\\"<br />And the fun doesn't stop there, for it is merely the first track. We have the great and funky alt-rock perennial \\"The Distance\\" featuring McCrea's brilliant delivery, the lyrically simplistic but absolutely wonderful \\"Friend Is A Four-Letter Word\\", the oddly compelling one-two punch of \\"Open Book\\" and \\"Daria\\", the short little piece \\"Race Car Ya-Yas\\", featuring another memorable \\"chorus\\":<br />\\"The land of the race car ya-yas<BR>The land where you can't change lanes<BR>The land where pink fuzzy dice<BR>Hang proudly<BR>Like testicles from rear-view mirrors\\"<br />And then we get into the latter half, which isn't as good but still with plenty of gems. A lot of the songs take an almost Country approach which I don't care for myself, (\\"Stickshifts And Safetybelts\\", \\"She'll Come BackTo Me\\") but there's still the genius of the witty, dry, twisted cover of \\"I Will Survive\\", the cynical \\"She's Coming Down\\", the pleasant but unusually long for Cake \\"Italian Leather Sofa\\", and \\"Nugget\\", featuring YET another memorable chorus:<br />\\"Shut the f**k up<BR>Shut the f**k up<BR>Learn to buck up<BR>Shut the f**k up<BR>Learn to buck up\\"<br />It all ends with the melancholy \\"Sad Songs And Waltzes\\" where McCrea sadly proclaims:<br />\\"It's a good thing that I'm not a star.<BR>You don't know how lucky you are.<BR>Though my record may say it,<BR>No one will play it.<BR>Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year.\\"<br />While Cake does have a good discography, this is their real masterpiece, a witty, fresh little gem. A personal favorite of mine, Fashion Nugget is not only the quint-essential Cake album, it's a genuinely refreshing piece of alt-rock most will skimp on. My advice: Don't.<br />Final Grade: A
0684853523|5.0|I've been working on a book (in my head) for over 20 years!  How many of us can say that?  probably a lot, I would guess.  A friend of mine gave me this book as a gift after she and I had discussed our mutual interest in writing.  What a gem this book is!  Stephen King's talent for writing is unmistakable.  As the other reviews have already said about this book, the first section, sort of an auto-biography, gives you a glimpse of how his ideas are formed based on his background.<br />I found myself laughing out loud at many portions of this book, his quick wit and the way he was able to make even the most horrible events from his childhood seem almost comical are a true talent.  I really did learn a lot from this book about writing and what to do as well as what not to do!  (watch out for those adverbs!)<br />If you are an aspiring novelist you owe it to yourself to add this book to your personal library (and read it!)  You don't even need to be a fan of King's fiction work.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I sort of got into Rammstein because of my friend, and sort of as a joke (Hey, its a bunch of guys screaming German!) but the more I listened their music, the more I started to really like them. Not as a joke, but as a real band, that played music that was about 10 times better than any American stuff. Then a year or two ago, this CD came out, and I went to the store, and bought (so far) my favorite album of all time (actually tied with Sehnsuct, but still)<BR>   So here is my humble opinion on each and every song on this album:<br />1. Mein Herz brennt (Means &quot;my heart burns, not &quot;my hair is bent&quot;)- one of the great songs on the album, sounds sort of like a Metallica song, if Metallica had any tallent whatsoever, could write good songs, and were German.<br />2.Links 234- this song is also great, nuff said<br />3.Sonne- in my opinion, it could be better, but everyone I know says it's the best song on the CD.<br />4. Ich will (means &quot;I want&quot; in German) Possibly the greatest song I have ever heard. The music video is cool too. You should watch that if you can.<br />5. Feuer frei! (means &quot;free fire!&quot; hence the bang-banging)-great song, featured in the Triple X movie- Ein Heisser Shrei!, BANG BANG- FEUER FREI!!<br />6. Mutter (means &quot;mother&quot; in German)- awsome song, one of the best. Also the first, sort of less angry song on the album<br />7. Spieluhr (no idea what it means, let someone else look it up)- another one of the sort of softer songs, nice glokenspiel, though<br />8. Zwitter (the sound birds are soposed to make in Germany)- very fun song, love the guitar. This I think actually is my favorite song.<br />9. Rein raus ( means &quot;in, out&quot; in German&quot;)- good song, sort of like &quot;Feuer frei!&quot; in a way, but not as angry<br />10. Adios- by the end of the album, it sort of gets into more sadder sounding songs that are less angry, if only I actually spoke German.<br />11. Nebel- the last song. A good ending song, though. (You know how there are a lot of CD's in which the last few songs aren't really even worth listening to)
B00005JLYW|4.0|When I saw Charlie's Angels 2, it trutly blew me away. It was a lot better than the first part and it had a good plot. The action was cool and alot better than that stupid movie &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. I reccommend this movie to anyone who are fighting fans! The only part they messed up on was when Demi Moore jumped off the building and flew throught the sky. That looked too fake!
0385512104|5.0|THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME by Mark Haddon<br />A wonderfully unique book, THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME by Mark Haddon is one of those rare books that comes around once in a blue-moon and changes your perception of how a novel should be written.  Haddon changes some of the rules and follows the heart of the narrator and main character, young Christopher John Francis Boone, as he tries to solve the mystery of a dog that was found dead in his neighbor's yard.<br />Christopher is a teenager, but not your average every day boy.  He is an autistic savant. He lacks the skills to blend in socially with the rest of the world, has no sense of humor, and can barely find his way around town despite the fact that he can read.  Yet, he is bright and shows a great compulsion for learning, especially in the fields of math and the sciences. In short, he's a genius. He can run quadratic equations in his head, using random variables to find solutions to various problems. He can talk at length about the cosmos, explaining the theory of relativity as if it was child's play.<br />When Chris discovers the next door neighbor's dog \\"murdered\\", he tries his best to search for the truth.  The police and Mrs. Shears accuse him of doing the dirty deed, but as Christopher always explains, he cannot tell a lie and tells the policeman that he did not kill the dog.  After an altercation that ensues due to the policeman touching him, Chris is consequently taken to the local jail, where his worried father comes to pick him up and take him home.<br />Thus begins the rather unusual telling of the story of the murder of a dog, and Christopher's search to discover the killer.  This is Christopher's book, and it is told in his own unique way.  Because of his love of prime numbers, the chapters are numbered with only prime numbers (1,3,5,7,11, and so on).  He intersperses the story with chapters on number games, puzzles, and other interesting facts that float inChristopher's head when he needs to get away from the rest of the world, which more often than not confuses him.  Yet, despite his fear of strangers and his inability to function in society, he ventures out and plays detective, asking neighbors if they had seen anything strange the night before the murder of this dog. <br />I highly recommend THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME.  As I had no expectations when I started this book, it was a lovely surprise to find this unusual style of writing in the form of fiction.  At times reading like a math dissertation, other times reading like a journal, it was a different approach to getting to know an unusual character, Christopher Boone.  And while he tells the story of the murdered dog, the reader gets to step inside this unusual mind, to discover what makes him tick, what makes him feel, and what makes him love.  THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME will definitely be on my list of the top 30 books read in 2004.
B0000AI45P|4.0|To offer a stellar review of Marquee Moon would be repetitive and pointless, especially since I'm still fairly new to the genius of this album and am by no means an authority on its merits.  It's actually still on repeat in my car stereo, slowly creeping under my skin. There is simply nothing to say that hasn't already been expertly noted within the customer reviews below (and above) this one...  <br />But I'll make a notable exception:<br />If for no other reason, listen to the remastered album for the final bonus track, which is listed as &quot;Untitled Instrumental&quot; but is so brilliant it needs no name.  A gritty fusion of manic ska-guitar, dance-punk pace, and crisp, infectious melody, this song would be corrupted if it were somehow unearthed from secrecy.  So I'm telling you about it in hopes that you'll restrict amplified listens to your private time on the road.  Warning: watch the speedometer...this is one of those tunes that unconsciously compels you to drive faster.
0780622650|5.0|This movie was most enjoyable for me to watch when I was in middle school! I can't think of a better science fiction movie around. Star Trek has lost all hope of beciming good again. Star Wars no longer has a story. This movie was superb. I wish a sequel was made. The action and effects were great. I didn't like the guy from friends, but he did have the best equipment designed for any movie. The story was interesting. I believe the time warp scenes were tight!!! This movie deserves glory because there hasn't been any other good science fiction in a long time. I hope you enjoy it too.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|When I saw the trailer, I thought it was to be a great movie. I was wrong.They messed up the plot, the action is very familiar,and it was boring! The first part was alot better. They completly messed up the series.
B00005JMFO|5.0|WOW!! This was one of the best movies we have seen all year. Wonderful for Christmas or any other time you want to laugh and be entertained.Not a dull moment in the movie. People in our theater actually applauded at intervals in the movie. When it was over, everyone left dancing in the isles. <BR>My husband said, \\"lets buy it when it comes out on DVD\\". We are still waiting......Great movie. Hugh Grant was WONDERFUL! As were all of the players. WOW!
B00004S367|5.0|Let's see, Talking Book, Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale, Songs In The Key Of Life, and Hotter Than July are Stevie Wonder's greatest achivements in music history. What about the 1972 album, Music Of My Mind? Well, it's very underrated because it has been overlooked thousands of times. Some people don't even enjoy it anymore. This would be the first time he experiments with new electronics and synthesizers. Music Of My Mind also revised his contract for Motown Records. My favorite songs on this album is \\"Superwoman\\", \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\", \\"Sweet Little Girl\\", and the experimental, \\"Girl Blue\\". Although this is not my favorite Stevie Wonder album, it's a great album I like to listen to. Before I even buy any of his 70's albums including this classic, I would buy Original Musiquarium 1, which is a great introduction to Stevie's 1970's creative period. In my opinion, this is  a 5-star classic because he had put all of his ambitions and energy in this album. It's very personal and entertaining at the same time.
B00005JME0|5.0|Of course, as we all know about the Butterfly Effect, if you don't, well let me inform you.  The Butterfly Effect is when you change something from the past and change something, by stepping on something or just change something that happened.  To for an example, the Simpsons, when Homer found a toaster and then realized it was a time machine, and he went back in time and stepped on an egg, and when back in the present and the there were no doughnuts.  Well, this is the same thing.<BR>   Well, I liked the idea that he reads his journals to go back to his memories, and no I am not giving any pieces of the movie away that are not in the previews because that spoils the movie. He has to read his journals to go back in his memories and then he can change something from his memories, but he has this power to where when he changes his memories, it alters the future.  Of course, if you don't know this yet, then you need to watch the preview buddy.<BR>   At first I didn't think Ashton Kutcher was going to pull this off because, come on, it's Ashton Kutcher.  I wasn't really fond of him on movies, just on tv on That 70s Show.  Now come on, when you said Ashton Kutcher, you just automaticly think, Kelso from 70s Show!  But I was really surprised that he did acttualy pulled it off.  Then after that, it made me realize, \\"Wow, he is a good actor\\".  I really recommend this movie because of his acting skills.  I know much of you are saying, \\"No, because it's Ashton Kutcher.  I don't like preppy guys.\\"  But no.  Because this is a good movie.  I am one of those people who doesn't like any movie.  I like those gothic-horror types with a sad ending at the end, or just a unpredictable fate from the charater.  But somehow, this was a good movie that I liked.<BR>   Amy Smart was a perfect role for Kayleigh.  I mean, she is a good actress.  She did play a person who is in love with a college guy in Road Trip.  She did look like a person who looked like she was on drugs(no, this is in thepreview also, when you see her turn her head out of a door).  There is no doubt in my mind that she is a good actress.<BR>   I love the idea of a scientific idea or theory made into a movie.  Resident Evil was a good movie.  I like those action packed movies that are based on a scientific theory.  But I really recommend this movie to anywho likes scary movies, horror movies, gothic genres.  I guess that ends the darkness of a butterfly.
B00009NH5W|5.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  This is simply a perfectly polished gem.  Each song has its own aura and TTD's voice never sounded better.  I heard a preview of the album a couple of years ago on Sananda Maitreya's site (that is what he calls himself).  I was hoping that he would release it as TTD and he did with the songs in a different order.  In any sequence I love it.
B00008EYA5|4.0|SWAT is a good movie full of plenty of action that benefits from a pretty good cast.  After a hostage situation goes wrong, Jim Street is pulled from his SWAT team and must work in the &quot;cage.&quot;  When a new team needs to be formed by a sergeant coming out of retirement, Street is one of those picked.  The new crack team must train together and learn all about the job.  Problems arise when drug dealer and general lowlife Alex Montel is apprehended and offers $100 million to whoever can get him out.  This brings anyone in Los Angeles who can wield a gun to try and get him out.  The new SWAT team must figure out a way to transport him to maximum security.  This is a full-blown action movie that will keep you riveted.  The scene with a plane landing on the Sixth Street Bridge, while obviously CGI, is a great example of the action.<br />  Colin Farrell stars as Jim Street, the cocky SWAT officer who works his way back onto the team.  This is basically the same role as in The Recruit.  Samuel L. Jackson is very good as Sergeant Hondo who is brought out of retirement to train and lead this new SWAT team.  Olivier Martinez sneers his way through as Alex Montel.  The rest of the SWAT team includes LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez, Josh Charles, and Brian Van Holt.  The Special Edition DVD offers several commentaries, four featurettes, a gag reel, deleted scenes, widescreen presentation, and a mini documentary about the SWAT equipment with demos.  For a highly entertaining action movie with a pretty good cast, check out S.W.A.T.!
B00005Q4ED|1.0|In the first place, there is no first place.  The movie starts at Lowood. (Where they cut Jane's hair instead of Helen's) The editing has us jumping from one scene to the next with the certain knowledge that we've missed the scene in between.  It is so dark, it's almost impossible to watch.  Susannah York is brutally bad -- Jane Eyre is not supposed to wear eyeliner and false eyelashes--I'm almost sure of that.  Thornfield (as far as I could tell) was appropriately gloomy. Stick with the Orson Welles version -- He IS Rochester to me.  And why do they keep remaking this in the first place?  Aren't there now about 10 versions?
B00008DDSC|4.0|This is a peculiar black comedy about a subject matter that has been approached in cinema before, but not in such an open and healthy manner. Sadism and masochism are subjects usually left for films about serial killers, sociopaths or the underworld of freaks. In cinema, at least, this topic, and the issues it raises about human sexuality, human suffering and the notion of power and dominance, has been for the most part, taboo, and it is a step in the right direction for the industry to present it in such a fresh, open and humorous way.<br />Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young woman with a few issues about herself and her family. The film opens with her leaving an institution, and her therapist wishing her well in the outside world. We come to see that Lee uses pain as a coping mechanism - burning and cutting herself when life becomes too difficult. She learns some office skills at the community college and lands a job at a one-man law firm. Edward Grey (James Spader) is not what one would say is your `normal' employer. When we first meet him in the interview scene, one gets the immediate impression that this man has a few issues of his own. As the story begins to unfold, however, one can see that these two unique individuals just might have something in common. This becomes all too apparent in the scene where he `punishes' her for making too many typos in her letters. Personally, I didn't know whether to be shocked or laugh during this scene, and ended up quite stunned and laughing at the same time. It would have been extremely difficult to pull off this particular scene without losing its underlying power, as it demands both comedy and depth, but Spader and Gyllenhaal made it real, funny and powerful in every sense.<br />~ Secretary~ is to a large extent a coming of age film. Here is a young, obviously intelligent and sensitive woman, discovering aspects about herself that are not necessarily `normal' to our middle-of-the-road sensibilities. She meets someone who makes her aware about herself, and at the same time, she makes him aware that love can exist and be expressed without feeling guilt. This is a love story though a kind of love story one does not hear about very often. `Secretary~ is a funny, odd and entertaining film.makes her aware about herself, and at the same time, she makes him aware that love can exist and be expressed without feeling guilt.

B00008AWOG|5.0|Try not to get the impression Opeth are just another arrogant pseudo-death-metal group.  'Hardcore' metal with no real point-of-view, trying to exploit a fashionable subculture and late-adolescent angsty trend.  Opeth take you on a journey.  A melancholic legend and enigma unravels on a haunting ancient melodious pathway.  The lyrics are strongly emotional, poetic and romantic.  Mikael kerfeldt sings smoothly with great range and versatility.  The music swings between soft mellow guitar, death waltz and exotic metal.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album all the way through.  I know I've bought a good CD when I can listen to it track by track and still be excited about what's coming up next.  This album is like a really good book.
